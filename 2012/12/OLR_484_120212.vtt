WEBVTT

00:14.141 --> 00:24.899
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, December 2nd, 2012, a new Wii console is unveiled, a classic console is reborn on iPhone and iPad, and could Sony be planning a break-apart controller for the next PlayStation?

00:31.977 --> 00:34.179
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

00:58.197 --> 00:59.197
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, Jamie Summers?

00:59.517 --> 00:59.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing alright.

01:00.177 --> 01:00.437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

01:00.778 --> 01:00.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:01.158 --> 01:01.878
[SPEAKER_07]: What's new with you?

01:02.518 --> 01:03.998
[SPEAKER_07]: Hanukkah's coming up real quick, isn't it?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it starts the 9th.

01:06.879 --> 01:07.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:08.139 --> 01:11.220
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got to... Wait, are you going to be here next week if it starts the 9th?

01:11.960 --> 01:12.820
[SPEAKER_07]: We better figure that out.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.061
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to find out if the temple is having something.

01:16.081 --> 01:19.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll verify the dates and... I'm glad I thought to ask.

01:19.822 --> 01:26.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, because usually my temple does something for the first and whatever, you know, Shabbat is during Hanukkah.

01:26.443 --> 01:26.603
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:27.063 --> 01:39.333
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'd have to find out, but I mean, it's, I'm already getting out my little, uh, I have this, uh, thing I got at Target of all places that's like little felt candles and you can put them up on the, this, uh, banner.

01:40.013 --> 01:42.655
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already getting some of the decorations out of all places.

01:42.695 --> 01:47.218
[SPEAKER_04]: The grocery outlet had six pointed blue Christmas ornaments.

01:47.679 --> 01:49.540
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, I'm going to use these.

01:50.181 --> 01:50.461
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

01:50.741 --> 01:50.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:51.902 --> 01:53.063
[SPEAKER_04]: So hooray.

01:53.328 --> 01:53.608
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:53.648 --> 01:57.309
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll also say hello to Tech Master Loki joining us here in studio.

01:57.429 --> 01:58.069
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, Loki?

01:58.269 --> 01:58.950
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.970
[SPEAKER_06]: McDonald's again during the show.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.111
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like... It's cheap.

02:02.171 --> 02:03.431
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like your standard thing now.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's cheap and I was over there running errands.

02:06.012 --> 02:06.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

02:06.532 --> 02:08.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at McDonald's, but in the plaza with McDonald's.

02:09.193 --> 02:10.053
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a Big Mac.

02:10.433 --> 02:10.793
[SPEAKER_07]: Stat.

02:12.327 --> 02:13.928
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, what else is new with you?

02:14.568 --> 02:21.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm still trying to fix the Minecraft server, trying to get this one plug-in mob arena to work correctly.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.511
[SPEAKER_06]: And I fixed... There was an error in the config file.

02:24.531 --> 02:25.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I fixed that.

02:25.752 --> 02:28.673
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still not accepting any of the commands, though, so...

02:29.853 --> 02:30.093
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.265
[SPEAKER_07]: Josh's First Gaming Experience

03:10.024 --> 03:13.328
[SPEAKER_06]: And he likes hitting the button to make the bubbles blow from the dinosaur.

03:14.049 --> 03:14.950
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how we started.

03:15.371 --> 03:20.977
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone remember, does anyone in studio maybe remember, like, what turned them on to video games in the first place?

03:21.018 --> 03:26.684
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I know you have to have, like, a really young memory for most of us, because I know most of us started in, like, the Coleco Atari era or whatever.

03:26.985 --> 03:27.766
[SPEAKER_07]: But does anybody remember...

03:28.466 --> 03:41.254
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, I don't remember a lot being a kid, but I think the fact that I could control what was on the television, besides just the remote, but I could actually make my own TV show of sorts, was kind of what turned me on to gaming.

03:41.634 --> 03:42.975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what it was exactly.

03:43.735 --> 03:49.359
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, Hanukkah starts on the 8th, so I was right in general as far as daytime goes.

03:50.299 --> 03:52.121
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's nothing going on, so I'll be here.

03:52.321 --> 03:53.661
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, phew, just checking.

03:53.702 --> 03:54.702
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let my candle before I go.

03:54.782 --> 03:57.624
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if I needed a guest host, I like to know that stuff in advance.

03:58.103 --> 03:58.663
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:27.802 --> 04:35.067
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you've never listened to Bobby's show before, you're missing a little kind of bonus segment with us, for lack of a better term, at the end of his show every week.

04:36.268 --> 04:36.988
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a good show.

04:37.368 --> 04:39.370
[SPEAKER_07]: The other 50 minutes of the show are great, too.

04:39.430 --> 04:40.851
[SPEAKER_07]: He's one guy talking about games.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.732
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like to give him a nice little plug there every now and then.

04:43.833 --> 04:50.237
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can check out all the great shows that make up the lineup of the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.098
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's vognetwork.com.

04:52.278 --> 04:52.538
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

05:11.335 --> 05:19.498
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about this because thanks to the Omega DLC this week, you might be going for girls this time, right?

05:20.818 --> 05:23.819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, she's dead, so I mean... Don't spoil!

05:23.839 --> 05:24.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh!

05:24.319 --> 05:25.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:25.619 --> 05:26.180
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

05:26.200 --> 05:31.801
[SPEAKER_04]: She's only in the DLC, I'll put it that way.

05:33.462 --> 05:35.902
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only a moment, and I just appreciate it.

05:35.922 --> 05:40.824
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly she has still some residual going on for Miss Arya.

05:42.085 --> 05:44.647
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there is a little bit of tension going on there, isn't there?

05:44.767 --> 05:47.069
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite line, I love it when you're feisty.

05:47.370 --> 05:47.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Wink.

05:48.911 --> 05:51.953
[SPEAKER_07]: Acidic Vampire has changed the line to Mrs. Kandros.

05:52.414 --> 05:52.874
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.436
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, Vicarian.

05:56.377 --> 05:57.458
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what this is going to turn into?

05:57.478 --> 06:08.267
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to turn into a freaking TV series like they have with Grey's Anatomy or something like that where it's going to be on a starship and it's just going to be drama and people sleeping with each other because that's all that Mass Effect is really.

06:08.487 --> 06:10.509
[SPEAKER_06]: That and a third person shooter, but

06:11.527 --> 06:12.147
[SPEAKER_07]: and Grunt.

06:33.996 --> 06:34.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

06:34.676 --> 06:36.617
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I will say this.

06:36.637 --> 06:38.858
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get into our gaming week soon enough.

06:39.218 --> 06:39.758
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say this.

06:40.718 --> 06:51.121
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to make Loki happy with my fandom coming full circle, I did place my order, my $60 order, for the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation 3, which will be shipped the day the game is launched.

06:51.481 --> 06:52.942
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now it's complete.

06:54.442 --> 07:21.572
[SPEAKER_07]: that means the only system I don't have it on now is Wii U but I'm gonna I'm holding off on that until they fix some of the DLC which I do need to issue an errata you know heaven forbid we ever misspeak on Orange Launch Radio and I say something wrong but I did last week I said that none of the multiplayer DLC was available on Mass Effect 3 Wii U that is incorrect it does include the first three multiplayer download packs but I believe it is missing this most recent one still so

07:22.713 --> 07:24.814
[SPEAKER_07]: It is still missing something that the other consoles have.

07:25.035 --> 07:29.338
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still lame, the options that you're not allowed to carry over.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a whole other thing.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Which people will get to hear once a certain podcast is available.

07:36.804 --> 07:40.847
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful, I'll have you taken out and back and roughed up too, like a chatter who was trying to spoil it earlier.

07:42.168 --> 07:44.050
[SPEAKER_07]: But what was I going to say about all that?

07:44.810 --> 07:47.813
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this is just rumor or fan wank or what, but supposedly...

07:48.693 --> 07:52.117
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect 3 Wii U is selling better than BioWare had anticipated.

07:52.518 --> 07:56.723
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are looking at... I mean, I guess that kind of stuff is always a possibility.

07:57.183 --> 08:00.367
[SPEAKER_07]: We only thought we'd sell a copy and we sold two.

08:00.607 --> 08:01.088
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

08:01.188 --> 08:01.568
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

08:02.229 --> 08:02.509
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.332
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's move on.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.514
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do a kickoff topic real quick.

08:07.495 --> 08:09.056
[SPEAKER_07]: You call this a storm?

08:09.456 --> 08:10.297
[SPEAKER_07]: This land is your land

08:26.485 --> 08:27.666
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:55.103 --> 08:57.766
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've also got some games coming in from my rental service.

08:58.226 --> 09:01.890
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give Forza a try because some of our VOG fans have been talking about it.

09:02.371 --> 09:04.012
[SPEAKER_07]: And whatever else they end up sending me.

09:04.413 --> 09:04.873
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

09:04.893 --> 09:06.055
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any catch-up games?

09:06.715 --> 09:08.157
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you were talking about before the show.

09:08.177 --> 09:10.019
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I have all these games I haven't even touched.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, it's because I just remembered to go through.

09:13.397 --> 09:20.444
[SPEAKER_06]: I was adding all my Steam codes for the Humble Bundles I have and stuff, like past ones.

09:20.825 --> 09:22.547
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some that I haven't even redeemed yet.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.729
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of them I have not played yet.

09:24.769 --> 09:31.316
[SPEAKER_06]: And even the stuff from the summer sale or whatever, most of the games that I've bought there, I have not played.

09:32.097 --> 09:35.258
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I have a ton of games I could be playing.

09:35.738 --> 09:45.482
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on top of that, you know, just the stuff that I did buy and played a little bit of, you know, on console that I still have to play more and, you know, more Minecraft.

09:45.922 --> 09:47.723
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got plenty of stuff to keep me busy.

09:48.821 --> 09:55.547
[SPEAKER_07]: Jim Sally in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Actually, Rob, Walking Dead is on now on the East Coast, and I'm skipping it for you.

09:56.167 --> 09:57.268
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess apparently it's on at 9.

09:58.209 --> 10:00.811
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you guys for skipping that show to come be with us.

10:00.851 --> 10:08.337
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they invented DVR and Hulu and other ways to watch TV shows later on, even though I have yet to watch any Walking Dead.

10:08.377 --> 10:09.158
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not hating on it.

10:09.198 --> 10:14.983
[SPEAKER_07]: I hardly watch any TV shows unless it's RuPaul's Drag Race or Happy Endings, actually.

10:15.023 --> 10:16.124
[SPEAKER_07]: I strangely like that show.

10:16.544 --> 10:16.924
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

10:17.085 --> 10:17.305
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

10:18.546 --> 10:20.647
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, anything that you're trying to catch up on?

10:21.508 --> 10:29.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've been trying to get my newly purchased copy of Sonic Generations to download because I've really wanted to play that game and I got it way cheap on Steam.

10:29.753 --> 10:30.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Steam.

10:31.394 --> 10:35.077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing that stupid Fairy Solitaire game because I want to beat it this year.

10:36.318 --> 10:44.643
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, I mean, oh, I got another game that just looks so cool to me and it had been kind of on my radar for a little bit but I finally just broke down and bought it.

10:44.663 --> 10:45.764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game called Closure.

10:46.769 --> 11:16.223
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it yet where it's basically it's all black and white and it uses the light to create your area around you so basically wherever the light shines it exists if the light isn't shining there it doesn't exist meaning you can create holes in the ground and drop down into other levels and it's a really neat application of physics so it's been on my radar for a little while and I've wanted to play it so I finally just downloaded it other than that I'm playing my usual

11:17.233 --> 11:17.734
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

11:18.514 --> 11:19.155
[SPEAKER_04]: I touched well.

11:20.417 --> 11:20.957
[SPEAKER_04]: It liked it.

11:21.758 --> 11:24.341
[SPEAKER_07]: You pretty much just did your gaming week together with a question, didn't you?

11:24.361 --> 11:26.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because a lot of it's combined.

11:26.824 --> 11:28.386
[SPEAKER_04]: I've downloaded the stuff, I've prepped it.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it just is a matter of sitting down and playing it.

11:31.029 --> 11:34.332
[SPEAKER_07]: You were talking a little bit about Project Greenlight stuff before the show.

11:34.392 --> 11:35.734
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that something you've been participating with?

11:35.934 --> 11:39.796
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking to see what the new stuff coming in is and if it interests me or not.

11:39.857 --> 11:42.098
[SPEAKER_04]: I've watched the trailers for a few things and I was like, eh, crap.

11:42.958 --> 11:43.979
[SPEAKER_04]: It just hadn't interested me.

11:44.179 --> 11:45.320
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got like one thing.

11:45.520 --> 11:50.303
[SPEAKER_07]: Not every idea is something you're going to jump up and go woo at, but there's some good things on there.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.724
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been poking around in there too.

11:52.685 --> 11:58.828
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing going on is that I want to hook up the Dreamcast and actually I've had this urge to play through Grandia 2 again.

11:59.529 --> 12:03.031
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking about playing it or the SNES and playing through Earthbound.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.862
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was thinking about revisiting some classics too.

12:07.183 --> 12:07.543
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

12:07.703 --> 12:14.788
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it would be fun to get one of those little streaming things for the TV and do a little streaming session of a game.

12:15.028 --> 12:20.913
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something I've been talking about for forever and it's one of those new media things that we've completely missed the boat on.

12:20.973 --> 12:21.993
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what we should do?

12:22.814 --> 12:24.035
[SPEAKER_04]: We should actually play through Secret of Mana.

12:24.824 --> 12:26.665
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:56.080 --> 13:12.641
[SPEAKER_06]: this week I played Black Ops 2 but more we finally finished up playing all the multiplayer maps and now we're just kind of going back and playing whatever we want to play and I finished the single player campaign which actually ended kind of short it was starting to get really good and then it's like and done

13:13.682 --> 13:20.844
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that one that they were showing kind of in all the trailers and stuff where all the drones are attacking LA and that kind of thing.

13:20.984 --> 13:23.225
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the second to last mission of the game.

13:23.885 --> 13:30.267
[SPEAKER_06]: And so right after that, it's like, oh, we're going to attack where the source is coming from and game over.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, okay, that was...

13:32.848 --> 13:59.544
[SPEAKER_06]: and I guess there's multiple endings to the game but dude I don't even know like all the different things that you do in the game there's only like a it must have been like three maybe two second clip it's like something happens and then I guess that changes based on how you play the game so woohoo a five second clip that I you know affected by playing the game differently in different spots

14:00.304 --> 14:00.624
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

14:00.864 --> 14:01.545
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of weird.

14:01.885 --> 14:04.906
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably wouldn't go back and replay through all the campaign again.

14:06.406 --> 14:07.766
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was fun the first time.

14:09.567 --> 14:11.508
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish it was longer because it was actually pretty cool.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.388
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was getting really good.

14:15.049 --> 14:15.609
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done with that.

14:17.929 --> 14:19.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Also played Far Cry 3.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.250
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is fantastic.

14:22.950 --> 14:24.731
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing through the single player campaign of that.

14:25.211 --> 14:26.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cinematic.

14:28.211 --> 14:30.352
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the detail in the jungle.

14:30.672 --> 14:32.812
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty awesome for even a console game.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Reminds me a lot of Just Cause 2.

14:35.373 --> 14:37.013
[SPEAKER_06]: The locale and everything.

14:37.433 --> 14:40.614
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the AI is kind of stupid sometimes.

14:40.634 --> 14:41.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

14:41.534 --> 14:42.775
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:04.708 --> 15:12.661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of an exploit, I guess, but the animals can attack you in a car, so you just drive over the animal with a car.

15:13.061 --> 15:14.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we gotta hunt a tiger because it's very dangerous?

15:15.044 --> 15:15.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit it with a car!

15:15.906 --> 15:17.649
[SPEAKER_06]: PETA's calling and telling you to stop.

15:18.670 --> 15:19.712
[SPEAKER_04]: PETA can bite my ass.

15:20.017 --> 15:20.877
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.

15:20.937 --> 15:24.199
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, you're trying to kill me.

15:24.899 --> 15:29.080
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to shoot at you, get you to run back towards me, hop in my car, and then hit you with the car.

15:29.981 --> 15:31.881
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the same thing with Komodo dragons.

15:31.921 --> 15:35.423
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll just gang up on you and just boop, boop, back and forth.

15:36.363 --> 15:37.003
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're dead.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.524
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we collect their skins.

15:39.064 --> 15:42.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even better is that you get these animals to chase after you.

15:42.545 --> 15:47.467
[SPEAKER_06]: They run back to one of the outposts that you've taken over, and your men kill them.

15:48.087 --> 15:54.928
[SPEAKER_06]: or you can hang out at one of those outposts where these animals are normally and they'll just keep spawning and your men will keep killing them and you just loot everything.

15:55.508 --> 15:57.749
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if one of the guys dies, you just loot him.

15:59.169 --> 15:59.769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.

16:00.269 --> 16:01.990
[SPEAKER_06]: I just love manipulating all that stuff.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.050
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretty interesting storyline.

16:05.070 --> 16:10.151
[SPEAKER_06]: I went through one of the first drug trip moments in the game.

16:10.651 --> 16:12.031
[SPEAKER_06]: That was interesting.

16:12.252 --> 16:13.652
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked the way they did it though.

16:13.832 --> 16:14.372
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.434
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's see what else.

16:17.494 --> 16:18.475
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of Minecraft.

16:18.515 --> 16:21.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Still trying to get this damn plug in the work and it's been pissing me off.

16:22.478 --> 16:24.440
[SPEAKER_06]: But just some reminder stuff.

16:24.940 --> 16:29.264
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got, you know, it's at vog-minecraft.com to check out.

16:29.464 --> 16:37.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now it's just a dynamic map, but eventually once I get everything working on the server, I'm going to actually... I'm going to load that site and hope it doesn't break the show as it loads.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.131
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't break the show.

16:38.451 --> 16:39.212
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that bad.

16:39.252 --> 16:42.395
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, it looks like the map has even expanded more since the last time I checked.

16:42.415 --> 16:43.156
[SPEAKER_06]: It's possible.

16:43.676 --> 16:49.322
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been still trying to... We've been running into some things that are not working because I'm loading in so many plugins.

16:49.422 --> 16:57.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Like certain... I think it's a lot of the Craftbook stuff was just causing things to not work right because they have like different...

16:58.610 --> 16:59.891
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to set a night.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.222
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Minecraft orgy night, but not like an actual orgy.

17:28.322 --> 17:31.424
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to do that, but eventually we'll get there.

17:32.084 --> 17:38.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, like I said, I'm trying to set up this arena because I know I've got everything in there and it's pretty awesome.

17:38.687 --> 17:41.429
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need to get this actual hit off the ground.

17:41.909 --> 17:45.811
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you can go to vog-minecraft.com for the 3D map.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.332
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually poke around and see what people are building and stuff.

17:48.352 --> 17:49.972
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can actually see people when they're in-game.

17:50.333 --> 17:54.654
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you can even chat with them too through that window, which is kind of neat.

17:55.535 --> 17:58.416
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to ask you about this since you're a Minecraft fan and all the listeners as well.

17:58.436 --> 18:01.737
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm sure a lot of the listeners that we have would not have seen this.

18:01.797 --> 18:02.778
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really funny.

18:02.818 --> 18:06.439
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually found this on Reddit on the gamers community.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever heard of this app that they have on the iPhone called Grindr?

18:11.181 --> 18:11.642
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:35.865 --> 18:37.686
[SPEAKER_07]: So somebody messages him out of the blue.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.668
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, sexy, lovely blue eyes, like the sea.

18:40.708 --> 18:41.509
[SPEAKER_07]: And they send a picture.

18:41.969 --> 18:43.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other pictures for me there, sexy?

18:44.070 --> 18:46.852
[SPEAKER_07]: And Steve replies back, hello, sir, how are you?

18:46.932 --> 18:48.453
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have many a picture for you.

18:48.553 --> 18:52.876
[SPEAKER_07]: And sends back a picture with the pig and the lamb, like from the game.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.897
[SPEAKER_07]: Like these are game screenshots.

18:54.937 --> 18:56.678
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can't mistake this for a video game.

18:57.518 --> 19:00.180
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy replies back, so very handsome indeed.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.301
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you live on a farm?

19:03.041 --> 19:05.023
[SPEAKER_07]: And Steve replies, I move around a lot.

19:05.123 --> 19:08.826
[SPEAKER_07]: I often have to quickly build shelter out of dirt and cobblestone before sunset.

19:09.467 --> 19:12.149
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy replies back, so you're a handyman.

19:12.189 --> 19:13.551
[SPEAKER_07]: You must be quite fit too then.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you into older men?

19:15.372 --> 19:16.493
[SPEAKER_07]: Another picture perhaps?

19:17.154 --> 19:21.398
[SPEAKER_07]: And so another in-game picture comes back and says, you know, I cannot run skeletons and zombies.

19:21.898 --> 19:22.959
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy like doesn't get it.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.361
[SPEAKER_07]: Want to meet?

19:25.482 --> 19:28.465
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Steve replies, okay, have you got any redstone for a compass?

19:28.785 --> 19:30.627
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your X and Z coordinates?

19:31.107 --> 19:33.430
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy goes, I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.792
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the guy replies back with a picture of a compass.

19:35.972 --> 19:37.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, obviously the guy's trolling.

19:37.414 --> 19:40.917
[SPEAKER_07]: He's hella trolling, but it's funny that the guy's falling for... Poor guy.

19:40.997 --> 19:42.419
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he's falling for me.

19:42.439 --> 19:42.779
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

19:43.280 --> 19:43.600
[SPEAKER_07]: You're an idiot.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.802
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see how anyone can be that stupid.

19:46.182 --> 19:47.644
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know, you never know.

19:47.724 --> 20:00.756
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless, you know, unless he's like... This guy probably knows nothing about... Unless he's like visually impaired or something like that and so his, you know, computer or whatever is reading back the text and he doesn't realize that it's, you know, a picture of a, you know...

20:01.997 --> 20:03.157
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question though.

20:03.758 --> 20:08.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you decide what your character looks like?

20:08.939 --> 20:09.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

20:09.459 --> 20:09.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

20:10.479 --> 20:11.900
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I don't own the game.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I play as Zangief.

20:14.881 --> 20:15.801
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me link that in chat.

20:15.821 --> 20:16.181
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

20:16.241 --> 20:18.682
[SPEAKER_07]: See if you want to see that for yourself there.

20:19.162 --> 20:21.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, someone did the best thing on Tumblr.

20:22.843 --> 20:29.447
[SPEAKER_04]: They took Garrus and Tali and put them in a horse-drawn carriage and then had Gordon Freeman decorating a tree.

20:29.547 --> 20:31.568
[SPEAKER_07]: You and your fandom need to stop derailing the show.

20:31.628 --> 20:32.348
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Loki?

20:32.768 --> 20:39.892
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one of the other things, I saw an article about how to render Minecraft worlds and stuff like that to pretty awesome 3D images.

20:40.312 --> 20:45.775
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll probably do that too at some point, maybe on the website once I get this stupid plug in the work.

20:47.079 --> 20:47.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

21:08.586 --> 21:36.130
[SPEAKER_06]: um and then also I played uh was it uh Skillrex um or Skrillex I guess the uh Legend of Skrillex or whatever the hell that game was it's some like Skrillex game oh yeah I think that's a news item later yeah but it's pretty awesome it's uh really Skrillex awesome well the game's awesome I think it's kind of cool I mean it's a little bit like Zelda and stuff but it's it's done by the same guy that did the um

21:36.750 --> 21:37.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Strangers game.

21:38.110 --> 21:40.171
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that have Balki in it?

21:40.371 --> 21:42.312
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was pretty fucking rad.

21:42.352 --> 21:42.992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty awesome.

21:43.032 --> 21:44.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I give it a pass then.

21:44.973 --> 21:45.573
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.094
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, My Gaming Week.

21:48.194 --> 21:49.254
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot of new stuff.

21:49.734 --> 21:56.616
[SPEAKER_07]: Warcraft got a big patch this week, so I was playing a lot of that because there's upgrades to go for and things for my other show, Horde House.

21:57.577 --> 22:03.178
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play some more Wii U. I played more Super Mario Bros.

22:03.578 --> 22:04.839
[SPEAKER_07]: U. New Super Mario Bros.

22:04.859 --> 22:04.879
[SPEAKER_07]: U.

22:05.960 --> 22:24.458
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't beat it yet, but I'm getting really close I think I'm on the last level before the castle level And then I hear once you beat it, like any Mario game, it's gonna have all new stuff And I already know these exits have multiple levels and shit So I'm having a good time with it, it's fun Also on the Wii U, I did download something new

22:25.840 --> 22:41.313
[SPEAKER_07]: I decided to kind of try out the process of a download title and so I wanted to download one that looked interesting to me so I checked out Mighty Switch Force Hyperdrive Edition first I gotta say though again with the whole Nintendo LOL online part

22:41.933 --> 22:42.934
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

23:01.247 --> 23:05.969
[SPEAKER_07]: unless you go into download management and say, power off my system when the downloads are done.

23:06.029 --> 23:08.611
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's not really proactive about it, so I kind of learned that the hard way.

23:08.991 --> 23:09.811
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so whatever.

23:09.831 --> 23:11.092
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to wait for the download.

23:11.712 --> 23:16.374
[SPEAKER_07]: Once the thing was finally done downloading, it took four minutes to install.

23:17.095 --> 23:23.958
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what are you doing where you just downloaded the whole... Now, what are you doing for four minutes to install a game that's only half a gig?

23:23.978 --> 23:25.699
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but the PS3 does the same thing.

23:26.671 --> 23:28.611
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not as bad, though.

23:28.772 --> 23:31.472
[SPEAKER_07]: PS3, 60 seconds tops for a download game.

23:32.012 --> 23:33.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Four minutes on the Wii U?

23:33.232 --> 23:33.533
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

23:33.593 --> 23:37.573
[SPEAKER_06]: It must be that underclocked CPU that they rumored to have.

23:38.094 --> 23:40.514
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little clunky, so I was not a fan of that.

23:40.554 --> 23:41.454
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever.

23:42.194 --> 23:44.595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the worst thing I've ever experienced.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's not a slam on the game.

23:47.816 --> 23:50.596
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to see what the Wii U download experience would be like.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.497
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, all right, well, that's different.

23:53.897 --> 23:57.040
[SPEAKER_07]: All your DS games are gonna come out on Wii U, just wait!

24:17.677 --> 24:30.390
[SPEAKER_07]: What was cool about this is that you can either play with the action going on on the TV and a little radar on your Wii U pad along with the lives and all that, or you can hit a button and have the whole game on the pad.

24:30.490 --> 24:32.993
[SPEAKER_07]: I like those games where you have the option to do one or the other.

24:33.713 --> 24:40.458
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but the game itself, you're trying to find these five prisoners in a level and they're all anime babes.

24:40.798 --> 24:48.403
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to find these prisoners in a level and you have like jump, shoot and switch and the switch will make blocks appear and disappear.

24:48.783 --> 25:17.391
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's either like one way or the other way there's only like two configurations but then it gets more complicated where the blocks might actually be like launchers from like Sonic the Hedgehog that'll like make you fire in a certain direction and you know then you have to use these bomb enemies put them in the launchers to explode blocks across the page you know just kind of like a puzzle platformer but I like those type of games so it's fun it looks like there's only about 20 levels though but it's already getting like you're really having to think like even as early as like stage four or five so

25:18.692 --> 25:23.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Alpha Kanatagram wants to say about Mighty Switch Force in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

25:38.191 --> 25:47.881
[SPEAKER_07]: The second screen enhances it, and I use that term very loosely, with the whole radar, which is a neat thing, but it's not necessary to the game.

25:48.321 --> 25:54.948
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm okay with that, because I don't think the 3DS, or the Wii U... I mean, the same thing, I mean...

25:56.440 --> 26:12.397
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the Wii U should whore that second screen too much because you're not physically capable of seeing two screens at once unless it's one of those Nintendo Land games where you hold the thing up to the TV like the little ninja game or things like that.

26:12.417 --> 26:16.742
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some games that are built that way, but most of the gaming experiences aren't built like that.

26:17.122 --> 26:20.225
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm okay with the second screen being, like, informational.

26:20.525 --> 26:22.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Glance down here occasionally.

26:22.587 --> 26:25.169
[SPEAKER_07]: A subscreen that you don't have to hit the button to switch to.

26:25.229 --> 26:26.790
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think that's an okay use of it.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.992
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hmm.

26:29.092 --> 26:37.959
[SPEAKER_07]: AlphaCanadagram also wants to point out Mighty Flip Champs, which is kind of like a cousin series, also by WayForward, did come out on the PSP.

26:38.019 --> 26:39.380
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it was a PS Mini.

26:39.901 --> 26:40.001
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

26:41.022 --> 26:42.263
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I like the game.

26:42.483 --> 26:43.344
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a $10 game.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.806
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where most of the Wii U downloads seem to be priced is around $10, $15.

26:46.626 --> 26:52.371
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I thought it was... I didn't sit there going, oh, I wasted my money on this experiment.

26:52.391 --> 26:54.653
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, this game is kind of fun and I would play this again.

26:55.234 --> 27:01.739
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be really awesome if I could beam it to my 3DS and have it on the go, but I know that's asking a lot of Nintendo.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.522
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

27:06.548 --> 27:09.810
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we get into the news, quickly some plugs.

27:10.431 --> 27:13.233
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

27:13.593 --> 27:16.675
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

27:16.975 --> 27:19.557
[SPEAKER_07]: We are on Google Plus as well under Orange Lounge Radio.

27:20.177 --> 27:21.658
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to plug our mailbag.

27:21.698 --> 27:22.719
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always send us emails.

27:22.759 --> 27:24.260
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to those in the second half of the show.

27:24.660 --> 27:26.782
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

27:27.122 --> 27:30.383
[SPEAKER_07]: and again, please help us support all indie podcasts.

27:30.483 --> 27:43.629
[SPEAKER_07]: I always like to just plug all indie podcasts and the hard people, you know, the hard working people behind, you know, producing these shows and especially the ones on the Voicing Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, especially those shows.

27:44.349 --> 27:46.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news.

27:47.070 --> 27:47.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

27:47.991 --> 27:53.474
[SPEAKER_06]: So, holy crap, Nintendo announces another system, but except it's only for Canadia.

27:54.454 --> 27:55.915
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's Canada.

27:56.815 --> 27:57.536
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Mini.

27:58.036 --> 28:09.302
[SPEAKER_06]: And what Wii Mini is, is a really small version of the Wii that lacks a lot of things, including SD card support, Wi-Fi support, or actually any internet connection support, and...

28:12.082 --> 28:17.226
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's basically just if you want to play games, and that is it.

28:18.206 --> 28:20.248
[SPEAKER_06]: So games... But it's pretty.

28:20.308 --> 28:20.928
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

28:20.968 --> 28:24.150
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty small, and I kind of like the way it looks.

28:24.190 --> 28:28.353
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looks like it's got a top loader disk drive to it, and it's red.

28:28.493 --> 28:33.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least it's black with a red trim on it, and the controllers that come with it are red.

28:33.757 --> 28:37.539
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be available December 7th for $99.99.

28:37.599 --> 28:38.580
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that's Canadian.

28:38.600 --> 28:38.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

28:39.441 --> 28:47.551
[SPEAKER_06]: and um oh also not compatible with GameCubeDisc but most Louise nowadays are not either so it's not a big surprise um

28:49.454 --> 28:59.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so game system, Red Den Chuck, Red Wiimote Plus, sensor bar, power adapter, and composite cable for $99.99.

28:59.636 --> 29:01.896
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool looking.

29:02.076 --> 29:05.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of people on the... I'm surprised you're speaking as nicely of this as you are.

29:05.297 --> 29:07.478
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of people on the interwebs don't get it.

29:08.378 --> 29:08.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Why this?

29:09.078 --> 29:11.058
[SPEAKER_07]: You're pushing the Wii U. What the hell is this about?

29:11.138 --> 29:14.699
[SPEAKER_06]: It's why the price point down really low, and I think they figure a lot of people...

29:15.319 --> 29:18.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be honest, I mean, their online was kind of, eh.

29:18.640 --> 29:19.440
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was alright.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.361
[SPEAKER_06]: You can download virtual console games and stuff like that.

29:21.401 --> 29:22.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, obviously, you can't do that now.

29:23.101 --> 29:26.142
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't download any DLC or any downloads whatsoever with this.

29:26.262 --> 29:32.803
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, they had that kind of in place where not a lot of people were probably utilizing it.

29:32.823 --> 29:37.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, like, you know, Grandpa and Grandma are probably not downloading virtual console games.

29:37.885 --> 29:39.325
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably don't even know how to do that.

29:40.946 --> 29:47.931
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is more trying to get into, I guess, those places where people are looking for cheap gaming systems.

29:48.011 --> 29:49.712
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they haven't jumped into this.

29:49.792 --> 29:53.254
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe you get hooked on this, you'll buy something else.

29:53.614 --> 29:59.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, it's kind of weird to see this coming out so late because there's really not a whole lot of Wii games coming out.

29:59.658 --> 30:08.404
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, if this was something that they were introducing towards the end of the life cycle, not, like, literally at, you know, 1159 of the clock, you know, Wii.

30:10.546 --> 30:34.089
[SPEAKER_06]: it's pretty much done here uh but yeah but there's already a gigantic library out there i mean it's not there's like a lack of wii software yeah that's true but i mean i don't know i would think that they would want to you know try building up their it's kind of like what they did remember with the psp they had like a psp version or whatever with no wi-fi and stuff and it was supposed to be really cheap i just i don't know it's kind of weird that they put that out but

30:35.448 --> 30:36.629
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little weird, but I get it.

30:55.330 --> 30:59.112
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, oh, I've always wanted Wii Sports, but oh, it's only $99 now.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.292
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, maybe I'll get it now.

31:00.852 --> 31:04.694
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, a real cheap alternative to having the kids room.

31:05.034 --> 31:12.737
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that it doesn't have internet actually is a great selling point for parents who might be trying to control, you know, very heavily what their kids are doing.

31:13.277 --> 31:14.058
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:30.632 --> 31:32.273
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is it a test market thing?

31:32.293 --> 31:33.093
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a test market.

31:33.113 --> 31:36.614
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you think about it, they don't want to mass produce these things and have them not sell.

31:37.014 --> 31:39.295
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are just mass producing them from one market.

31:39.635 --> 31:42.816
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that way, if it's a flop, you're not stuck with millions of these.

31:43.136 --> 31:45.557
[SPEAKER_06]: Or probably not millions, but hundreds of thousands of them.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.478
[SPEAKER_06]: You're only stuck with a few thousand instead.

31:49.478 --> 31:56.120
[SPEAKER_07]: Also something to consider, it's not completely unheard of for Nintendo to do this thing well after the other console has started.

31:56.220 --> 32:03.482
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but those top loader NESs came out right when the Super Nintendos were already coming out.

32:04.102 --> 32:07.683
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think the Super Nintendo got a remake as well when the 64s came out.

32:08.803 --> 32:23.764
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember if the 64's got a remake around GameCube but you still had like the Pokemon 64 and there were some other little remodels that came out relatively late in the life and then GameCube PS2 did the same thing and PS1 yeah right right

32:24.344 --> 32:47.642
[SPEAKER_07]: so I mean well those see even with Sony though that tends to happen kind of like mid-cycle Nintendo's always done it very late so this whole Wii Mini it's not unheard of it's like the DSi XL yeah it's weird that they're taking some of the features away but I guess if they want to get at that bargain basement price and you know maybe they're trying to see they maybe they think somebody who wants internet and their device ought to just get a Wii U yeah

32:49.677 --> 32:52.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft asks, does the mini come with Wii Sports though?

32:52.801 --> 32:53.782
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it comes with nothing.

32:54.082 --> 32:54.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

32:55.264 --> 33:00.570
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, none of the systems sell with Wii Sports anymore.

33:01.150 --> 33:07.017
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually, well, I mean, they have a bundled one, but they've got it being sold separately now for 20 bucks.

33:08.298 --> 33:12.740
[SPEAKER_07]: How easy though is it to get like a copy of Wii Sports at GameStop for probably like five bucks?

33:13.040 --> 33:13.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Or EB Canada or whatever they have up there, you know?

33:16.661 --> 33:18.442
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway.

33:19.582 --> 33:23.483
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, obviously it's not something I would pick up anytime soon, but they're nice looking.

33:23.503 --> 33:28.845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's neat, but I kind of want to see someone hack this apart, you know, to add all those features back in.

33:28.865 --> 33:35.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, you know, an SD card slot might be kind of nice, but I mean, if they had an SD card slot, you know, you could buy that and then...

33:36.488 --> 33:38.731
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you use the SD card slot for when there's no internet?

33:39.351 --> 33:43.315
[SPEAKER_06]: You use it for loading the homebrew channel and all the exploits that go along with that.

33:43.335 --> 33:44.056
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there you go.

33:44.997 --> 33:51.784
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, VxJasonXV in our chat says, the GameCube wasn't remodeled, but there was the Panasonic Cube.

33:52.304 --> 33:53.546
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was only in Japan.

33:53.586 --> 33:55.127
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that wasn't a late cycle thing.

33:55.147 --> 33:56.689
[SPEAKER_07]: That was actually really early on, wasn't it?

33:57.543 --> 33:59.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Panasonic Q is pretty early.

34:01.265 --> 34:02.546
[SPEAKER_07]: I always kind of wanted one of those.

34:03.006 --> 34:03.466
[SPEAKER_07]: Not anymore.

34:03.506 --> 34:05.327
[SPEAKER_07]: Expensive for just a DVD player.

34:05.447 --> 34:08.509
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember seeing them in, I think, a Japan town in LA.

34:08.549 --> 34:09.089
[SPEAKER_07]: We would see them.

34:09.109 --> 34:11.131
[SPEAKER_07]: They were like $700 or something crazy like that.

34:11.691 --> 34:12.591
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

34:13.412 --> 34:14.753
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't going to be getting one anytime soon.

34:15.633 --> 34:22.757
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on to a story about something that's been kind of controversial and on a lot of blogs and so forth this week.

34:23.477 --> 34:25.759
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a new Humble Bundle.

34:26.670 --> 34:32.432
[SPEAKER_07]: But this one's got some people raising their eyebrows because it's the Humble THQ Bundle.

34:33.232 --> 34:35.913
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's no longer the Humble Indie Bundle.

34:36.453 --> 34:38.574
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now selling THQ games.

34:39.354 --> 34:41.435
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there's still the charity.

34:42.155 --> 34:46.316
[SPEAKER_07]: You can split the money between THQ charity and the Humble Bundle website tip.

34:47.056 --> 34:48.717
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give all your money to one or the other.

34:48.937 --> 34:51.558
[SPEAKER_07]: You can adjust the sliders just like any of the previous packs.

34:52.978 --> 34:54.879
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with the soundtracks for all the games as well.

34:55.319 --> 34:57.060
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the other sticking point for a lot of people.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.822
[SPEAKER_07]: These games are only available on Windows Steam.

35:01.282 --> 35:01.863
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Canada.

35:02.263 --> 35:03.724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

35:04.044 --> 35:04.744
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't start lies.

35:05.064 --> 35:05.625
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

35:05.945 --> 35:13.689
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're only available on Windows Steam because THQ has imported these games to Linux or things like that, and I guess they don't have plans to.

35:15.009 --> 35:17.891
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Steam part means there is DRM.

35:18.631 --> 35:20.993
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Humble Bundle usually doesn't have DRM.

35:21.533 --> 35:26.516
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually, you can get a Steam key to load the games in Steam, which is what a lot of people do.

35:26.576 --> 35:27.197
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I do.

35:27.777 --> 35:35.182
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can also, once you've bought a bundle, you have a key that works forever that you can go into the site and just download the game on a whim.

35:35.822 --> 35:40.906
[SPEAKER_07]: If I wanted to, I could go to a friend's house, download the game, install it, and would never know.

35:41.366 --> 35:48.830
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with the Humble Bundle being open and pay what you want, you're not supposed to really do that, but if you want to, it's there.

35:50.371 --> 36:00.617
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of people that are, I don't want to say they're saying that the Humble Bundle is selling out, but I'm looking at a story on the Penny Arcade Report that says it is a step backward.

36:02.298 --> 36:02.718
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get it.

36:04.318 --> 36:26.848
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's not that like I have some I actually usually really respect in particular the Penny Arcade report and don't mishear me I'm not saying I don't respect him over this story I mean we always are welcome to having difference of opinion this is why we you know have the internet in the first place but I was I kind of had a little bit of a frown at this story because I was like this reads like gamer entitlement in a way to me and I was really disappointed

36:27.048 --> 36:27.749
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:52.225 --> 36:56.109
[SPEAKER_06]: They never said, you know, on the site that we're only going to do indie games.

36:56.189 --> 36:58.911
[SPEAKER_06]: They just, this is what they've been offering so far.

37:00.553 --> 37:01.614
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't buy it if you don't like it.

37:02.134 --> 37:04.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is from the Penny Arcade Report.

37:04.176 --> 37:05.557
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read a little quote here.

37:06.278 --> 37:13.865
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, Indies have been replaced by a single big name studio, DRM is back, and the variety of platforms supported has been shrunk.

37:14.305 --> 37:16.447
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't a humble bundle, it's a Steam sale.

37:18.740 --> 37:19.761
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not a Steam sale.

37:20.001 --> 37:22.442
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't donate all your money to a Steam sale to charity.

37:23.183 --> 37:24.383
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a huge difference.

37:24.644 --> 37:25.904
[SPEAKER_07]: A huge difference for a lot of people there.

37:25.924 --> 37:27.545
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't also pay what you want on a Steam sale.

37:27.565 --> 37:28.066
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

37:28.146 --> 37:31.808
[SPEAKER_07]: You still have to pay some sort of price there on a Steam sale.

37:32.388 --> 37:37.691
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the whole it stinks because they don't support all of the platforms.

37:37.791 --> 37:40.093
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the part I'm kind of with them at.

37:40.213 --> 37:45.236
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same token, I'm like, well, this is better than nothing at all.

37:46.115 --> 37:49.139
[SPEAKER_07]: and who said the Humble Bundle has to deliver something all the time.

37:49.619 --> 37:53.524
[SPEAKER_07]: I see the Humble Bundle, quite frankly, as gifts to the industry.

37:54.425 --> 37:57.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay what you want, donate to charity, lots of great games.

37:57.489 --> 38:00.072
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a freaking gift to the industry.

38:01.417 --> 38:02.918
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we feeling entitled?

38:04.018 --> 38:04.558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bad.

38:04.759 --> 38:05.619
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really bad.

38:06.279 --> 38:15.323
[SPEAKER_07]: And it kind of disappointed me that websites like this, that I'm like 99% of the time like, I'm with you, brother, went down this road.

38:15.403 --> 38:17.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Ars Technica, another one that wrote a piece that was very critical of it.

38:17.984 --> 38:19.165
[SPEAKER_07]: And I read that site all the time.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.306
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a great site.

38:20.326 --> 38:21.346
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good for page hits.

38:22.046 --> 38:22.827
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

38:24.427 --> 38:27.409
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says, this isn't the EA indie bundle.

38:28.589 --> 38:29.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Ain't that the truth?

38:29.490 --> 38:30.230
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

38:30.390 --> 38:31.111
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a thing.

38:31.131 --> 38:34.193
[SPEAKER_07]: He's making a joke there on something that was real.

38:34.273 --> 38:35.154
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tongue-in-cheek there.

38:37.136 --> 38:47.905
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly, I think that actually even though it's DRM and only limited platform, as an experiment, it's a good idea.

38:48.565 --> 38:51.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, it's a way for a company to...

38:53.700 --> 38:55.803
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, all these donations are tax write-offs anyway.

38:55.843 --> 39:01.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever they don't make on whatever the retail price of the game is is going to count as a tax write-off as a charitable donation.

39:02.655 --> 39:06.922
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a way to encourage people to give to those who need it.

39:09.185 --> 39:21.176
[SPEAKER_07]: The story goes on to make a point about how the bundle will not help the people that actually made the games in this case because a lot of the THQ employees have been laid off since the time this bundle came out.

39:21.717 --> 39:24.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I mean, since the time these games originally came out.

39:24.820 --> 39:27.102
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm kind of like, alright, I get that.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.243
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks, but...

39:29.444 --> 39:30.585
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

39:48.823 --> 40:17.910
[SPEAKER_07]: or there won't be any THQ games in the future and I kind of I applaud the fact that they're taking a risk and this is a risk around for everybody and I kind of wish more gaming companies would take risks and it seems to be paying off what three million dollars raised not necessarily all for THQ but you figure THQ even if they've got a half million of that is making way more money than they probably were off these games at this point anyway and let's be honest I mean they have Steam sales all the time like you know Saints Row the Third is always being marked down to like

40:18.810 --> 40:20.191
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 bucks, 15 bucks, or whatever.

40:20.631 --> 40:22.772
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of really what I wanted to buy it anyways.

40:22.832 --> 40:23.632
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, cool.

40:23.873 --> 40:25.253
[SPEAKER_06]: Donate money to everything.

40:25.293 --> 40:27.714
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I just wanted Saints Row the Third.

40:28.255 --> 40:30.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Six bucks is a pretty good price for Saints Row the Third.

40:30.916 --> 40:34.217
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get Red Faction Armageddon, which was awesome.

40:34.958 --> 40:36.659
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, you know, Metro 233.

40:37.899 --> 40:38.619
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other games.

40:38.900 --> 40:39.720
[SPEAKER_06]: And Darksiders.

40:39.880 --> 40:43.282
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's just icing on the cake for me.

40:43.462 --> 40:45.523
[SPEAKER_06]: So what?

40:45.923 --> 40:48.264
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hate the fact that I got a good deal on those games.

40:49.522 --> 40:52.663
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the hate on Steam for having Steam sales then, I guess.

40:52.964 --> 40:55.745
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know why people were just hating on it at all.

40:56.825 --> 40:59.146
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave well over the average, actually.

40:59.186 --> 41:03.608
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave a bit over the average to get the pack just because I wanted to support it.

41:03.729 --> 41:06.690
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of wanted to offset some of the negativity I saw on the internet.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.331
[SPEAKER_07]: And I donated the vast majority of it to charity.

41:09.411 --> 41:11.792
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave THQ a dollar and I gave a dollar for the tip.

41:11.872 --> 41:14.233
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because you should always give a dollar to something you support.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.614
[SPEAKER_07]: But I gave the rest to charity.

41:16.127 --> 41:17.091
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave it all to charity.

41:17.452 --> 41:19.239
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

41:20.826 --> 41:22.746
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, one more thing I want to read out of this story.

41:22.786 --> 41:26.367
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I don't mean to be picking on this, but this is just one of those things that I don't get it.

41:26.687 --> 41:32.008
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think this guy just had a moment of weakness or something, or I don't know.

41:32.888 --> 41:34.088
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, from the Penny Arcade Report.

41:34.729 --> 41:39.649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be a hypocrite and buy a bundle, just because these are incredible games at a staggering low price.

41:40.129 --> 41:42.710
[SPEAKER_07]: But wouldn't it have been something if they were offered without DRM?

41:43.070 --> 41:44.490
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if they ran on Linux?

41:44.870 --> 41:48.571
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if the space was used to promote games that hadn't already sold millions of copies?

41:49.775 --> 41:54.316
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would have been something, but it is what it is.

41:54.996 --> 41:57.677
[SPEAKER_07]: Steam doesn't always put the games I want on sale.

41:58.677 --> 42:02.298
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's to say the Humble Bundle would have been something maybe I would have been interested in?

42:02.578 --> 42:07.940
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it would have been another Humble Android Bundle, something I can't get any use out of, you know?

42:08.780 --> 42:09.760
[SPEAKER_07]: It is what it is.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.621
[SPEAKER_07]: You buy some and you leave some on the table.

42:14.926 --> 42:15.308
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

42:22.170 --> 42:24.431
[SPEAKER_07]: and I just don't sign on to that.

42:25.151 --> 42:29.252
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, this is not the first time that Humble Bundle's done a bundle for one company.

42:29.532 --> 42:32.312
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the Humble Frozen Byte Bundle, which I bought some time ago.

42:32.972 --> 42:34.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, I know, big difference.

42:34.973 --> 42:38.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Frozen Byte's an indie company, very different type of thing, but I just wanted to put that out there.

42:39.114 --> 42:43.495
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not unheard of for the Humble Bundle to do a pack dedicated to one company.

42:45.635 --> 42:46.396
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a great deal.

42:46.616 --> 42:49.919
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would encourage our listeners to check it out and support it.

42:50.219 --> 43:00.128
[SPEAKER_07]: HumbleBundle.com One thing we will not do on this show is give away keys that we bought for five cents to the pack of games minus Saints Row the Third.

43:01.049 --> 43:03.151
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that shit to be incredibly tacky.

43:03.671 --> 43:06.654
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're one of these podcasts that buys keys for...

43:07.535 --> 43:08.576
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess really it's a dollar.

43:08.616 --> 43:10.719
[SPEAKER_07]: I shouldn't say a quarter because you have to give a dollar minimum.

43:11.159 --> 43:18.188
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're one of these podcasts that buys the keys for a dollar just to get your show some cheap promotion and give them away on your show, I'm calling you out.

43:18.828 --> 43:19.729
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fucked up.

43:19.870 --> 43:21.091
[SPEAKER_07]: You're missing the point.

43:21.972 --> 43:25.956
[SPEAKER_07]: You're denying what potentially could be sales for charity.

43:26.316 --> 43:39.328
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, it's another thing if you gave $20 or $10 or more, you know, and maybe you're including the Saints Row, the third thing, because then, okay, you're fronting that kind of money for somebody who may not have the money.

43:39.588 --> 43:40.269
[SPEAKER_07]: But think about it.

43:40.649 --> 43:59.001
[SPEAKER_07]: if you buy it for a dollar and then give it away on your show to somebody who maybe hadn't heard of it yet who could have potentially spent $20 on the bundle but now won't because you gave them a key that you bought at bargain basement prices you have robbed charity of money for the sake of your own self-promotion don't do that

44:01.505 --> 44:06.107
[SPEAKER_04]: It is different if you buy the whole thing and go, I'm not going to play this crap.

44:07.628 --> 44:09.368
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

44:09.588 --> 44:14.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Even then, I mean, I've seen... I'm giving them to Dan, the games I'm not going to play.

44:14.611 --> 44:20.733
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a show doing it out there, and I'm not going to say who, that bought five codes.

44:20.773 --> 44:24.435
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, honestly, I don't know the name of it because it was something I saw while I was Twitter bouncing.

44:24.695 --> 44:25.915
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't even remember the name of it.

44:25.935 --> 44:28.316
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just kind of, I gave it so much stink eye.

44:28.396 --> 44:29.397
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh...

44:30.097 --> 44:31.421
[SPEAKER_07]: That's frustrating.

44:32.022 --> 44:33.726
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, stop it.

44:36.420 --> 44:37.961
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see.

44:38.101 --> 44:41.023
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

44:41.083 --> 44:45.566
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad from PodCulture says, I always donate 100% to charity.

44:46.087 --> 44:50.550
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm usually not a fan of much as the gamers, but they make a great perk for your donation.

44:51.010 --> 44:52.371
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he means kind of like the games.

44:54.873 --> 44:55.293
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

44:55.613 --> 45:01.898
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in chat says, Darksiders is very well worth this bundle, and you can give the Saints Row the third code to anyone you want.

45:02.418 --> 45:03.378
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

45:29.417 --> 45:35.861
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about something having to do with an old idea from Sony coming back to bite them in the ass?

45:36.821 --> 45:37.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least in theory.

45:38.762 --> 45:47.307
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2008, they had patented a break-apart PS3 controller, and nothing happened with it.

45:47.427 --> 45:51.909
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also not the huge space boomerang that was there at E3.

45:53.090 --> 45:55.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now they're revisiting the idea with a new...

45:56.892 --> 46:09.766
[SPEAKER_04]: Patent that I mean it even has it down to the circuit boards and everything and two different versions of it with a regular PlayStation controller with little move bobbles on it, which I don't get but okay and then

46:13.524 --> 46:20.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it has regular PlayStation controller handles and then really long ones, like extra grips.

46:21.388 --> 46:23.209
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess if you're doing move stuff with it.

46:23.229 --> 46:26.551
[SPEAKER_04]: So it almost seems to me like they're doing a two-handed move controller.

46:27.332 --> 46:31.294
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I was going to design a controller, I'd just make a new NegCon.

46:32.795 --> 46:37.637
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like the idea of there being a controller that kind of snaps apart and becomes the move.

46:37.677 --> 46:38.818
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually kind of rad.

46:39.258 --> 46:41.640
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks completely dumb.

46:41.660 --> 46:41.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

46:43.395 --> 46:44.416
[SPEAKER_07]: If they build it right.

46:44.476 --> 46:45.478
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was better designed.

46:45.618 --> 46:51.445
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, but Sony is not a stranger to going back and redesigning shit that gets received poorly.

46:51.846 --> 46:54.349
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the boomerang controller, everybody.

46:54.469 --> 46:56.191
[SPEAKER_04]: At least, that's what I said earlier.

46:56.231 --> 46:57.453
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the space boomerang.

46:57.473 --> 46:57.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

47:00.376 --> 47:04.358
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think, Loki, about a controller that can break apart and come together and all this?

47:04.539 --> 47:05.079
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks dumb.

47:05.899 --> 47:10.102
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks dumb only because, you know, a lot of people aren't interested in the move.

47:10.142 --> 47:13.344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, oh, we need to sell more of these move controllers.

47:14.625 --> 47:20.107
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think the thing that's keeping people out of the move is not the price point of their controllers.

47:20.267 --> 47:22.168
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that no one wants to play those games.

47:22.668 --> 47:26.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is sad, because it's a good controller.

47:26.390 --> 47:28.311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually pretty good.

47:29.051 --> 47:32.573
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I think it works better than the Kinect.

47:32.853 --> 47:39.716
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the tragic thing, is that in a way, the move is really the best motion thing out of all of them.

47:39.836 --> 47:40.036
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

47:41.135 --> 47:42.376
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody seems to care.

47:42.676 --> 47:42.896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

47:43.196 --> 47:44.997
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's even some games out there.

47:45.117 --> 47:46.297
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the one.

47:46.317 --> 47:49.118
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some download title that just came out.

47:49.178 --> 47:53.880
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where you're splashing paint with the controllers and like... Unfinished Swan.

47:54.181 --> 47:54.501
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

47:54.561 --> 47:55.301
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfinished Swan.

47:55.821 --> 47:57.482
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm hearing raves about it.

47:57.502 --> 47:59.223
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played it myself yet because I don't have a move.

47:59.243 --> 48:02.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I hear... I just found out like the other day you can do it with controllers.

48:02.404 --> 48:03.365
[SPEAKER_07]: So I need to check it out.

48:03.405 --> 48:03.945
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm hearing...

48:04.705 --> 48:32.225
[SPEAKER_07]: Raves about that game and in general the PlayStation Network in general like there's been a lot of great shit on that between Journey which you know is competing for game of the year for a reason in a lot of places and you know the Unfinished Swan and some of these other games like there's so much great shit on PlayStation that like is not getting noticed like Sony has a marketing problem big time and it's part of the reason why the move isn't really selling either.

48:32.625 --> 48:32.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Pura Pura

48:52.570 --> 48:52.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

48:53.571 --> 48:57.014
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Here's the question.

48:57.054 --> 48:59.396
[SPEAKER_07]: What if you lose half of that break-apart controller?

48:59.756 --> 49:03.859
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't be able to play with it because the half that's the analog stick and the D-pad is missing.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.602
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you think about it, what's the Wii U controller in the nunchuck?

49:08.543 --> 49:17.210
[SPEAKER_07]: That was kind of a breakaway controller of sorts, too, and a lot of times that kind of stood in for your typical controller controller.

49:17.350 --> 49:19.211
[SPEAKER_07]: was the nunchuck and the Wii Pad.

49:19.351 --> 49:22.112
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you lost the nunchuck, then stupid you shouldn't have lost it.

49:22.132 --> 49:24.173
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of that same thing.

49:25.993 --> 49:32.716
[SPEAKER_07]: Cram in our chatroom says, a boomerang controller would be perfect for all those rage-induced controller throws.

49:33.636 --> 49:34.316
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

49:34.756 --> 49:38.438
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation was the first console to get, well, Demon's Souls was the first game.

49:41.359 --> 49:41.779
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

49:43.039 --> 49:44.820
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, I like the boomerang.

49:46.266 --> 49:48.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people liked it, DarkSakura.

49:48.848 --> 49:51.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, see how much you like it when it comes around and hits you in the head.

49:52.210 --> 49:54.311
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was an actual boomerang, DarkSakura.

49:55.091 --> 50:01.195
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the buttons cut out some of the... I bet you anything that if they had marketed it that way, then someone would have found a way to make it work.

50:02.536 --> 50:02.816
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

50:03.396 --> 50:04.377
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with some more news.

50:05.336 --> 50:06.838
[SPEAKER_06]: TimeSplitters

50:20.576 --> 50:31.580
[SPEAKER_06]: So, now, TimeSplitters 4, I mean, that's been in talks for a while, you know, back when Free Radical was doing it, and then it was, you know, supposed to be being worked on by Crytek and stuff.

50:32.120 --> 50:38.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, unfortunately, the reason it hasn't kind of come out yet is because they haven't been able to find a publisher yet.

50:39.603 --> 50:40.424
[SPEAKER_06]: To actually put it out.

50:41.265 --> 50:46.831
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of sucks because Free Radical's last game, Haze, was kind of crap.

50:47.952 --> 50:52.257
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think TimeSplitters 4 would actually be a really great game.

50:52.377 --> 50:58.204
[SPEAKER_06]: They say that it was in very early stages of development when Free Radical went into administration.

50:58.804 --> 51:26.605
[SPEAKER_06]: and they even had a small playable demo that was shown to several publishers but it didn't attract enough of any publishing deals and they're also saying that the marketing person or actually they're saying secondly the marketing person would say something along the lines of I don't know how to sell this and then the unanimous opinion among all publishers were that they pitched TimeSplitters for

51:27.745 --> 51:32.287
[SPEAKER_06]: or I guess it's a game you can't market because it's too diverse set of characters.

51:32.747 --> 51:37.629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is kind of hard to explain a game that features exploding monkeys and cats with wheels on them that you race.

51:37.989 --> 51:41.710
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time though, look at Saints Row the 3rd.

51:42.472 --> 51:43.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect example.

51:43.573 --> 51:52.797
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, that is a little bit more linear, but you've got a thing from this crazy Japanese cat character to hitting people with giant purple cocks.

51:53.837 --> 51:56.499
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit people with giant cocks all the time, just saying.

51:56.739 --> 51:59.080
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly think the game markets itself.

51:59.140 --> 52:00.981
[SPEAKER_06]: You just show this crazy shit and people are like...

52:01.221 --> 52:03.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats with Wheels, fuck yes, sign me up.

52:03.962 --> 52:07.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I'm playing a game where I'm shooting people in duck costumes.

52:07.202 --> 52:07.762
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

52:08.023 --> 52:13.844
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of the reason we got behind President Cat all those years ago, is it was something different, crazy, and not done.

52:13.884 --> 52:15.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, just put the game out.

52:16.184 --> 52:23.646
[SPEAKER_06]: By understanding, everyone wants to play it really safe because new IPs kind of don't do well, but

52:24.369 --> 52:25.610
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a risk.

52:25.670 --> 52:27.912
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to take risks to succeed.

52:27.932 --> 52:28.793
[SPEAKER_06]: We just talked about this.

52:28.813 --> 52:29.373
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's how you do it.

52:29.454 --> 52:34.518
[SPEAKER_06]: You put out the HD version of the old PlayStation 2 games, because you've got three of them.

52:34.538 --> 52:37.841
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do an HD trilogy, which people are trying to get a petition going.

52:38.061 --> 52:41.724
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually has a lot of signatures on to get that to happen.

52:42.745 --> 52:51.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, based on the response from that, how well that sells, then you go decide, okay, should we move forward with putting this out as TimeSplitters 4?

52:51.372 --> 52:52.412
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would do well.

52:52.552 --> 52:56.235
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I mean, if they put out an HD version of these games, I would buy it in a heartbeat.

52:56.936 --> 52:57.316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy.

52:57.356 --> 52:59.838
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, TimeSplitters, seriously, was a great game.

52:59.878 --> 53:09.125
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of those games that I actually bought one of the, I forget what the hell they called it, but like a multi-tap, but it was basically, you know, maybe it was a multi-tap.

53:09.865 --> 53:12.047
[SPEAKER_06]: The four-player add-on for the PS2.

53:12.467 --> 53:16.290
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought that for TimeSplitters 2, and it was fantastic fun.

53:16.991 --> 53:18.652
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I just hope they do it.

53:19.312 --> 53:20.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody put it out.

53:20.794 --> 53:22.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, hey, you know what, Free Radical?

53:22.755 --> 53:25.137
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, or XFreeRadical, because I think they're gone.

53:27.979 --> 53:36.766
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they have the IP, which I don't know who owns the IP right now, but if they have the IP, there's always Kickstarter, and I guarantee that shit would get Kickstarted no problem.

53:39.207 --> 53:45.049
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, speaking of bad management decisions, Sega's been pulling some crazy shit on YouTube.

53:45.869 --> 53:59.192
[SPEAKER_07]: They are shutting down channels, or I should say, excuse me, shutting down the videos, which could lead to a channel shutdown if it happens too many times, of any type of uploaded video of the Sega Saturn RPG Shining Force 3.

53:59.232 --> 53:59.432
[SPEAKER_07]: Now...

54:01.853 --> 54:09.559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird because, you know, it's not like Shining Force 3 is this brand... It's not an episode of The Walking Dead that somebody's posting to YouTube.

54:09.919 --> 54:11.760
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's something that's years old.

54:11.860 --> 54:13.401
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is, why now?

54:14.022 --> 54:19.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is a new PSP installment called Shining Arc that is coming out in Japan in February.

54:20.607 --> 54:29.033
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so maybe they don't want people searching YouTube to get confused, but doesn't that seem a little bit throwing the baby out with the bathwater to somebody?

54:29.053 --> 54:29.133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

54:30.014 --> 54:31.456
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the other crazy thing.

54:32.217 --> 54:42.969
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only were Let's Play videos thrown out, walkthroughs, random gameplay clips, fans talking about Shining Force were shut down.

54:43.790 --> 54:45.732
[SPEAKER_07]: How is that even possible?

54:46.733 --> 54:48.294
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, here's how it's possible.

54:48.594 --> 54:58.517
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Sega is a YouTube partner, they get the little button that allows them to take down, you know, basically a content thing, no questions asked.

54:58.837 --> 55:02.039
[SPEAKER_07]: The content provider has only 24 hours to repeal it, da-da-da-da-da.

55:02.379 --> 55:06.700
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, NBC has these buttons too and so forth.

55:06.740 --> 55:16.224
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what led the internet to rage against PIPA and SOPA and all that stuff because it would have given the government one of these buttons.

55:16.804 --> 55:21.189
[SPEAKER_07]: and it would have been open season on not just YouTube.

55:21.649 --> 55:24.732
[SPEAKER_07]: Now granted, YouTube has the right to do whatever they want on their turf.

55:25.593 --> 55:27.896
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't claim this is a freedom of speech thing.

55:28.356 --> 55:35.544
[SPEAKER_07]: There would be nothing stopping you from going to Vimeo or whatever unless Sega decides to crack down there too or whatever other site you want to do.

55:36.124 --> 55:39.708
[SPEAKER_07]: But this just seems like a crappy decision on Sega's part.

55:40.168 --> 55:43.131
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if this is something to do with Shining Arc.

55:44.012 --> 55:47.595
[SPEAKER_07]: A game that's not even going to come out in the US, or so we think so far.

55:48.096 --> 55:48.336
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

55:50.538 --> 55:57.702
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to shut down all the fan channels of this niche game from many years ago to promote your new game.

55:57.802 --> 55:58.142
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

55:58.502 --> 56:02.684
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to ruffle the feathers of the people that will most likely be buying your game.

56:03.284 --> 56:06.266
[SPEAKER_07]: Why wouldn't you want some of the publicity out there and so forth?

56:07.406 --> 56:12.109
[SPEAKER_07]: Acidic Vampire wants to know, yeah, OLR, will this be bleeped on the downloaded podcast?

56:12.410 --> 56:16.092
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because this podcast isn't a part of YouTube.

56:16.553 --> 56:17.693
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of VOG Network.

56:17.733 --> 56:19.134
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have an agreement with Sega.

56:19.635 --> 56:26.600
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is where the government does allow me to say what I want for the purposes of critique.

56:28.361 --> 56:36.247
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't slander Shining Force or slander Sega or so what, but I'm entitled to my opinion, and my opinion is this is bullshit.

56:37.532 --> 56:39.073
[SPEAKER_07]: I was teasing in the chair room

56:59.460 --> 57:15.534
[SPEAKER_07]: so yeah, Caram in the chat says too now Sega is going to shut down OLR for mentioning Shining Force Shining Force, Shining Force, Shining Force Shining Force, Shining Force oh and how about this, Phantasy Star how about some Phantasy Star, Rob?

57:16.074 --> 57:25.723
[SPEAKER_07]: I would play some music from Shining Force but I can't because all the YouTubes have been shut down do I happen to have any in my collection?

57:26.183 --> 57:27.084
[SPEAKER_07]: I might, you never know

57:27.751 --> 57:30.015
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also the SoundCloud.

57:32.078 --> 57:32.519
[SPEAKER_07]: Look what I have.

57:32.559 --> 57:33.019
[SPEAKER_07]: Look what I have.

57:33.580 --> 57:34.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, see.

57:34.061 --> 57:34.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Look what I have.

57:34.982 --> 57:35.543
[SPEAKER_07]: Look what I have.

57:36.425 --> 57:36.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play it.

57:37.046 --> 57:37.767
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, everybody.

57:37.847 --> 57:40.511
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

57:46.783 --> 57:47.904
[SPEAKER_07]: Play that over in Mailbag.

57:47.924 --> 57:50.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Play it over in Mailbag.

57:50.585 --> 57:54.868
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I think technically you're only allowed to use 30 seconds for the purposes of your team.

57:54.988 --> 58:01.051
[SPEAKER_04]: As I found out when doing the intro to another show, it's 10% of the song up to 30 seconds.

58:01.891 --> 58:03.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll cut it off at 23 seconds.

58:03.912 --> 58:04.373
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

58:04.953 --> 58:06.874
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that song sucked.

58:12.031 --> 58:12.511
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

58:12.551 --> 58:16.573
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really think that, but I actually like Shining Force.

58:16.593 --> 58:17.953
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the sad thing about it.

58:20.694 --> 58:23.295
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

58:23.515 --> 58:25.816
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like a bunch of the old Shining Force games.

58:26.676 --> 58:29.437
[SPEAKER_07]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, I'm witnessing illegal behavior.

58:29.537 --> 58:29.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my.

58:30.777 --> 58:33.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee in chat says, Orange Pirate Radio.

58:33.959 --> 58:34.419
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

58:34.579 --> 58:34.879
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

58:36.279 --> 58:37.660
[SPEAKER_07]: SGO100 Matt says, No, no, no.

58:37.700 --> 58:39.240
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only Shining Force 3, guys.

58:39.280 --> 58:40.901
[SPEAKER_07]: Shining Force 1 and 2 don't count.

58:44.064 --> 58:51.783
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, that was Shining Force Medley by the way Let's move on to more news DarkSakura

58:52.671 --> 59:13.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for anyone who is a fan of The Walking Dead, as we know who was, you know, not listening to Bobby's show and was watching The Walking Dead or reading books, The Walking Dead Assault is going to be on iOS and it will be an isometric strategy game, which, I mean, guarantees I won't be playing it because I hate those kinds of games.

59:14.435 --> 59:16.997
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it's a pretty neat looking game.

59:17.057 --> 59:23.000
[SPEAKER_04]: It mostly looks black and white with a few blue elements and some blood splatter.

59:23.701 --> 59:24.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's some green in here.

59:24.761 --> 59:30.605
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it looks like it's mostly black and white with some overlay of various bright colors as effects.

59:31.145 --> 59:33.947
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it looks kind of neat.

59:34.367 --> 59:37.709
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's supposed to be episodic, like the Telltale series.

59:39.050 --> 59:44.534
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to follow a new cast, and it's going to be based more on the comic.

59:46.175 --> 59:48.216
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit promoting the competition, jeez.

59:49.017 --> 59:49.457
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

59:50.612 --> 59:50.792
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

59:50.812 --> 59:52.453
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the show is on right now.

59:53.054 --> 59:54.355
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear the game is very, very good.

59:54.375 --> 01:00:00.619
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on my list of things I need to finish this holiday season is the Walking Dead games, even though I've never watched the show.

01:00:00.659 --> 01:00:04.142
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't matter because the games are based on the books.

01:00:04.382 --> 01:00:06.023
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one common misconception people make.

01:00:07.744 --> 01:00:08.024
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:00:08.685 --> 01:00:12.748
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on and travel around the world and look at some games that are coming out very, very soon.

01:00:13.468 --> 01:00:19.896
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this week we've got Far Cry 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PC.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:26.383
[SPEAKER_06]: A few games coming out on the Wii, Rise of the Guardians, because it was a little bit delayed from the other launch.

01:00:27.003 --> 01:00:31.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Family Party, 30 great games, Obstacle Arcade on the Wii, only for $30.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:52.357
[SPEAKER_06]: Scribblenlots Unlimited on PC, Rapala's Probe Bass Fishing 2012 on the Wii U, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013 on the Wii U, Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on the Wii U, Guardians of Middle Earth on PlayStation 3, fun little voucher there.

01:00:53.877 --> 01:00:57.019
[SPEAKER_06]: I like buying digital games in a package.

01:00:57.919 --> 01:01:00.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Resistance Collection on the PS3.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.021
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else here?

01:01:03.281 --> 01:01:06.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the Mass Effect Trilogy on PS3 finally coming out.

01:01:07.082 --> 01:01:08.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Already pre-ordered.

01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:11.024
[SPEAKER_07]: You are such a consumer whore.

01:01:11.124 --> 01:01:12.064
[SPEAKER_07]: You would have done it too.

01:01:12.745 --> 01:01:13.285
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

01:01:13.385 --> 01:01:14.865
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wouldn't have because I play on PC.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:16.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

01:01:17.746 --> 01:01:18.107
[SPEAKER_07]: Also...

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.805
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope the PlayStation 3 version has an extra scene with Garrus just to make you mad.

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:31.112
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that's actually it for this week.

01:01:31.212 --> 01:01:34.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost to the end of games for this year because we only got a couple more weeks before.

01:01:35.797 --> 01:01:39.001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all kind of crap coming out next, but...

01:01:40.287 --> 01:01:40.667
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

01:02:00.339 --> 01:02:27.635
[SPEAKER_07]: Devil May Cry HD Collection, probably because of the new one A new slim console that's Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Emblem Edition Because Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Yume Kanaishi Mano comes out this week from Sega And that is on the PlayStation 3 And going to the Vita, nothing this week, but Spy Hunter coming out in Japan next week I didn't even know that was still a thing that was going on

01:02:28.555 --> 01:02:30.056
[SPEAKER_07]: on the 3DS this week in Japan.

01:02:30.116 --> 01:02:31.537
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper Mario Super Seal.

01:02:31.717 --> 01:02:34.019
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing good things about that, by the way, here in the States.

01:02:34.059 --> 01:02:35.700
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one I haven't looked at, but yeah.

01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:39.442
[SPEAKER_07]: Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari 2.

01:02:40.743 --> 01:02:41.984
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what is that?

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:44.065
[SPEAKER_07]: That has nothing to do, like, it's not Pikachu.

01:02:44.125 --> 01:02:45.046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Pika Pika.

01:02:47.508 --> 01:02:48.368
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what this is.

01:02:49.369 --> 01:02:50.229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cute.

01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:50.990
[SPEAKER_07]: What is she doing?

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.952
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like measuring crack on that little scale.

01:02:53.972 --> 01:02:54.012
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.971
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that seems like it's pretty self-explanatory.

01:02:56.991 --> 01:03:01.052
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a vet hospital game, actually, judging from the pets on the calendars.

01:03:01.112 --> 01:03:02.372
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's like a pet hospital game.

01:03:03.132 --> 01:03:03.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:05.673
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a pet pharmacist.

01:03:06.113 --> 01:03:13.255
[SPEAKER_07]: And Slime Morimori Dragon Quest III, Taikai Zoku to Shippodan on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:03:13.775 --> 01:03:15.596
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't end there.

01:03:15.816 --> 01:03:16.416
[SPEAKER_07]: Know why?

01:03:17.016 --> 01:03:19.737
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the Wii U launches on December 8th.

01:03:19.917 --> 01:03:21.598
[SPEAKER_07]: That is before our next show.

01:03:21.618 --> 01:03:22.398
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, stop it.

01:03:23.078 --> 01:03:29.202
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii U is great, and we'll be launching in Japan, of course, just like they did here with the black version and the white version.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:39.529
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a set they're going to be launching over there, the Monster Hunter 3G HD Premium Set, because one of their huge launch games is Monster Hunter 3G HD version.

01:03:39.909 --> 01:03:41.850
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a game that is launching with the console over there.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:50.035
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, other games launching in Japan this week for the Wii U. Assassin's Creed 3, Batman Arkham City Armored Edition, uh...

01:03:51.018 --> 01:04:00.661
[SPEAKER_07]: FIFA 13, World Class Soccer, Mass Effect 3 Special Edition, Musou Orochi 2 Hyper, New Super Mario Bros.

01:04:00.821 --> 01:04:13.225
[SPEAKER_07]: U, Nintendo Land, Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, and I think that's it.

01:04:13.665 --> 01:04:18.046
[SPEAKER_07]: Zombie U, rounding out the launch games over there in Japan.

01:04:20.675 --> 01:04:22.096
[SPEAKER_07]: That does it for Japanese release dates.

01:04:22.236 --> 01:04:23.636
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:04:24.276 --> 01:04:26.517
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 4th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath.

01:04:26.797 --> 01:04:29.898
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 5th, Guardians of Middle-Earth and The Critter Chronicles.

01:04:30.218 --> 01:04:31.139
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a cute name.

01:04:31.759 --> 01:04:38.641
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 7th, we have Air Conflict Specific Carriers, Mass Effect Trilogy Edition for PS3, and Paper Mario Sticker Star.

01:04:40.382 --> 01:04:40.742
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

01:04:41.682 --> 01:04:42.662
[SPEAKER_04]: The end, Rob!

01:04:43.483 --> 01:04:43.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Forever!

01:04:44.123 --> 01:04:44.503
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

01:04:44.523 --> 01:04:46.044
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we still have two more shows before that.

01:04:46.104 --> 01:04:46.444
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

01:04:46.864 --> 01:04:47.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:04:48.328 --> 01:04:59.492
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, speaking of all that hubbaloo and chat about the world ending on the 21st, did you know NASA has an official section on their website dedicated to why that whole thing is a farce and like the world is not easy?

01:04:59.732 --> 01:05:07.495
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was reading this fascinating story on Google about how like a lot of us kind of are treating it as a joke at this point.

01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:16.858
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, okay, the world's ending again because we all went through this, what, just six months ago when that wacko out of the East Bay was talking about, you know, May, whatever's Judgment Day, the rapture and all that.

01:05:17.698 --> 01:05:40.617
[SPEAKER_07]: But like some people get seriously emotionally disturbed by this stuff and I mean it makes sense especially like younger people really thinking like the world is going to end and they get really like depressed over it and like you know I don't mean to make light of it like it's actually really sad but it makes me just kind of think like oh we shouldn't shouldn't perpetuate that kind of crap because some people really take it like too far like they're just convinced that

01:05:40.917 --> 01:05:46.802
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though NASA has come out and said, look, there is no meteor headed towards Earth.

01:05:47.182 --> 01:05:49.845
[SPEAKER_07]: If there was, you could see it in the sky by now.

01:05:50.305 --> 01:05:54.348
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not like... It's a black meteor.

01:05:54.529 --> 01:05:55.930
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't see black on black.

01:05:57.031 --> 01:06:03.476
[SPEAKER_07]: Even in Majora's Mask, people, you could see the thing getting bigger as it was coming towards Hyrule.

01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:07.660
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be ironic if it was the meteor with the face on it.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.642
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway, let's move on.

01:06:12.003 --> 01:06:14.646
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:15.567
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki.

01:06:16.548 --> 01:06:17.449
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of cool.

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:26.580
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you happen to invest in one of the Raspberry Pis, the little pocket-sized computer that's like 35 bucks,

01:06:27.961 --> 01:06:28.722
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:44.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty awesome.

01:06:44.641 --> 01:06:45.742
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be free.

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.464
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to that.

01:06:48.564 --> 01:06:50.005
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually kind of want to get one of these.

01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:55.389
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a huge waiting list, or at least they did have a huge waiting list, you know, to be able to buy one.

01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:59.932
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, at the time, I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with this?

01:06:59.972 --> 01:07:04.395
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still kind of want one because it's kind of fun to mess with.

01:07:04.455 --> 01:07:06.697
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a $35 computer and now it plays Minecraft, so that's even better.

01:07:09.557 --> 01:07:10.938
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Minecraft going to be an Ouya thing?

01:07:11.298 --> 01:07:15.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to derail too much, but speaking of cheap... Well, here's the thing.

01:07:15.641 --> 01:07:30.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Minecraft is already on Android, and granted, Ouya is going to be supporting stuff that's through their marketplace, but I would think that it would be able to run, depending on how they have the buttons mapped for the controllers, if it runs like any of those...

01:07:31.372 --> 01:07:32.133
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:07:48.144 --> 01:07:52.707
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hope that they would have their own version for it, but I don't think it's going to be something you see at launch.

01:07:53.548 --> 01:08:02.014
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's going to be something that they'd have to adapt to it or get some sort of... Not just have to see how popular it is and then decide to port it over.

01:08:03.055 --> 01:08:15.463
[SPEAKER_06]: But who's to say it might run other games that are not officially supported by OUYA and it just may run.

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:16.324
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hopefully.

01:08:16.344 --> 01:08:16.604
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully.

01:08:18.578 --> 01:08:19.759
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:08:41.616 --> 01:08:42.737
[SPEAKER_07]: I had one for a while

01:09:02.879 --> 01:09:03.600
[SPEAKER_07]: Vectrex Vectrex Vectrex Vectrex

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:52.923
[SPEAKER_07]: it's free so if you want to check it out it does come with Mindstorm for free and you can check it out and I gotta say I was checking it out a little bit before the show and it's a pretty you know for these retro collections they didn't do a shitty job of it you know they you know because sometimes you see these retro collections they're kind of hack jobs like they're not very good but they actually you know put in little achievement systems they have a little cork board in there that you can have your little achievements on and they have the box arts the original one that you can fully rotate and you know look at and

01:09:53.183 --> 01:09:54.244
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a pretty good job.

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:55.605
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, hey, it's free.

01:09:55.705 --> 01:09:56.486
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not check it out?

01:09:56.546 --> 01:09:57.687
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play Mindstorm.

01:09:58.187 --> 01:10:06.073
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, of course, if you want more, 18 other titles from the Vectrex's collection are available for $6.99.

01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:07.655
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a bad deal.

01:10:07.975 --> 01:10:09.997
[SPEAKER_07]: That also comes with iCade support.

01:10:10.057 --> 01:10:12.298
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that interesting that they're paywalling that.

01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:13.739
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost got an iCade.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.260
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:15.721
[SPEAKER_04]: But still $100.

01:10:16.482 --> 01:10:18.143
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said earlier, I still kind of want one.

01:10:18.523 --> 01:10:19.284
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one too.

01:10:19.324 --> 01:10:21.125
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it is $100, I do still kind of want one.

01:10:21.145 --> 01:10:21.586
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I just...

01:10:21.986 --> 01:10:23.707
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine me just plopping it there on the table?

01:10:43.461 --> 01:10:44.642
[SPEAKER_07]: What is missing from the app?

01:10:44.842 --> 01:10:46.523
[SPEAKER_07]: Actual plastic screen covers.

01:10:47.123 --> 01:10:49.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you had on the... Do you remember you had to take these little screen covers?

01:10:49.785 --> 01:10:51.246
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what was missing on my Vectrex?

01:10:51.746 --> 01:10:53.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Actual plastic screen covers.

01:10:54.047 --> 01:10:55.028
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, you didn't have those?

01:10:55.108 --> 01:10:55.308
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:10:55.928 --> 01:10:59.770
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can play Mindstorm without one, but... You can play all of them without them.

01:10:59.811 --> 01:11:02.192
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure that the games have some sort of overlay.

01:11:02.932 --> 01:11:04.252
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, no, yeah.

01:11:04.412 --> 01:11:05.933
[SPEAKER_07]: In the app, obviously.

01:11:06.273 --> 01:11:09.693
[SPEAKER_07]: How hard is it with modern technology to just draw the plastic on top of it?

01:11:10.013 --> 01:11:10.894
[SPEAKER_07]: But it still looked kind of neat.

01:11:10.954 --> 01:11:11.374
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

01:11:11.874 --> 01:11:13.254
[SPEAKER_07]: So check that out.

01:11:13.294 --> 01:11:15.375
[SPEAKER_07]: Just search for Vectrex in the App Store.

01:11:15.475 --> 01:11:18.115
[SPEAKER_07]: V-E-C-T-R-E-X.

01:11:18.595 --> 01:11:23.096
[SPEAKER_07]: A little shout-out for those guys at Rant Media Games who've made that.

01:11:24.136 --> 01:11:24.456
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:11:24.576 --> 01:11:27.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what a great lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.

01:11:32.608 --> 01:11:37.392
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the vault so you know it won't be a Vectrex game.

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:42.457
[SPEAKER_07]: But she's going to pick a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be playing this game.

01:11:42.477 --> 01:11:43.618
[SPEAKER_07]: You better recognize.

01:11:44.539 --> 01:11:45.700
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you better recognize her?

01:11:47.061 --> 01:11:47.842
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, is it Tron?

01:11:47.862 --> 01:11:48.583
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you pick Tron?

01:11:48.623 --> 01:11:49.784
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't.

01:11:50.164 --> 01:11:51.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan picked the game again.

01:11:51.685 --> 01:11:52.086
[SPEAKER_07]: Again?

01:11:52.446 --> 01:11:54.248
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I have a reason for this one too.

01:11:54.588 --> 01:11:55.870
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what is the classic game of the week?

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:56.710
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Golden Axe.

01:11:57.411 --> 01:11:58.532
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not done Golden Axe.

01:11:58.592 --> 01:11:58.993
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:11:59.714 --> 01:12:01.596
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have done Shining Force.

01:12:02.837 --> 01:12:04.599
[SPEAKER_07]: You really should have, but that's okay.

01:12:04.839 --> 01:12:05.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.802
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so Golden Axe is the classic game of the week.

01:12:07.902 --> 01:12:11.166
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, Rob, your contrast is like way crazy on your computer.

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:12.227
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

01:12:12.267 --> 01:12:13.128
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all had those.

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:13.668
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop the...

01:12:14.549 --> 01:12:14.929
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

01:12:14.949 --> 01:12:15.590
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid ads, that's alright.

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:22.412
[SPEAKER_04]: But Golden Axe is a game that was primarily developed by Makoto Uchida.

01:12:23.053 --> 01:12:25.954
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a side-scrolling hack-and-slash video game.

01:12:26.094 --> 01:12:26.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Pow!

01:12:27.094 --> 01:12:34.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Done in 1989 for the... Actually, System 16B Arcade Hardware.

01:12:35.178 --> 01:12:38.999
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course it came out on the Genesis and Master System much later.

01:12:39.019 --> 01:12:39.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of a Conan the Barbarian type of game.

01:12:45.022 --> 01:12:47.263
[SPEAKER_04]: The high fantasy medieval world.

01:12:47.323 --> 01:12:51.745
[SPEAKER_04]: And you play as one of three characters who are getting revenge on Death Adder.

01:12:52.245 --> 01:12:53.106
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great name.

01:12:53.226 --> 01:12:55.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I always laugh at the later ones because we have Death Adder Jr.

01:12:56.607 --> 01:12:57.448
[SPEAKER_04]: That just makes me laugh.

01:12:57.848 --> 01:12:58.228
[SPEAKER_04]: DeathAdderJr

01:13:27.273 --> 01:13:29.033
[SPEAKER_04]: who tries to use it to kill you to death.

01:13:30.154 --> 01:13:33.435
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a male barbarian, and Rob, this is an even better name.

01:13:34.755 --> 01:13:36.976
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy's name is Axe Battler.

01:13:38.116 --> 01:13:39.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Axe Battler!

01:13:39.856 --> 01:13:48.879
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sounds to me like it would be, you know, something from like a redubbed anime that was like, sort of like, you know, Voltron or something.

01:13:49.779 --> 01:13:53.540
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have, he uses a broadsword by the way, and he's trying to

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:54.841
[SPEAKER_04]: DeathAdder is a bastard

01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:11.432
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a dirty bitch.

01:14:12.572 --> 01:14:24.558
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, they go to rescue everyone from Turtle Village, which actually turns out to be on a turtle, and the turtle takes them across the sea, and then they go to the castle in the back of a giant eagle, and then they beat Death Adder to death.

01:14:25.079 --> 01:14:26.059
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, how ironic.

01:14:26.419 --> 01:14:30.722
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out his daddy, Deathbringer, is the real final boss in the Genesis version.

01:14:31.222 --> 01:14:33.323
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they get the golden axe, and they're immortal like forever.

01:14:34.605 --> 01:14:39.568
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, it's, you've got, like, different, um, capabilities with them.

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:55.899
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the dwarf is strongest on weapon, but weakest on, um, spell power, where the, uh, Amazon is strongest on spell power, but weakest on sword power, and then the, the regular, you know, dude's like, look at my chest, and he's all average.

01:14:57.205 --> 01:15:02.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love the artwork for this because it looks like seriously something straight off of a D&D cover.

01:15:04.448 --> 01:15:16.092
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, the producer was super fond of the action movies, especially the Conan ones, so that's why he basically made the game in this theme.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.133
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's all kinds of other versions of it.

01:15:19.173 --> 01:15:23.135
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Mega Drive slash Genesis version that was very faithful to the arcade version.

01:15:23.555 --> 01:15:26.516
[SPEAKER_04]: With an extra level of play, you can kill Death Adder's daddy.

01:15:27.918 --> 01:15:37.337
[SPEAKER_07]: and we've got the uh this is my favorite part kicking the shit out of those little gnomes that had the potions yeah sorry and then um

01:15:40.712 --> 01:15:47.538
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Sega CD one that was a Sega Classics arcade that had Redbook audio, music, and voiceovers.

01:15:47.578 --> 01:15:49.719
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a virtual console version.

01:15:49.759 --> 01:15:53.382
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Sega Smash Pack, the Genesis Collection, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.

01:15:54.403 --> 01:15:57.446
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a version on PlayStation Plus for free.

01:15:58.446 --> 01:16:06.453
[SPEAKER_04]: There were also PC versions that came out that had a 256-color palette in VGA mode, and it could run it in EGA mode as well.

01:16:06.653 --> 01:16:09.494
[SPEAKER_04]: and a CGA and two-color mode.

01:16:09.514 --> 01:16:11.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you want to play it in two-color?

01:16:11.214 --> 01:16:16.175
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't lived until you've played Golden Axe and CGA.

01:16:16.195 --> 01:16:17.916
[SPEAKER_07]: Which color palette was it?

01:16:18.376 --> 01:16:23.297
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure it was the CMYK, not the RGB.

01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:27.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is very funny since monitors are built for RGB.

01:16:27.098 --> 01:16:28.078
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, whoops, I'm sorry.

01:16:28.598 --> 01:16:30.239
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the other palette wasn't RGB, it was RGY.

01:16:31.843 --> 01:16:35.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue was only in the CMYK palette.

01:16:35.467 --> 01:16:36.668
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't even CMYK.

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:38.730
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I can't get it right.

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:41.032
[SPEAKER_04]: CMYK is for print only.

01:16:41.112 --> 01:16:45.116
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was white, not black.

01:16:45.556 --> 01:16:48.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, cyan, magenta, white, and black.

01:16:48.599 --> 01:16:53.704
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other one was red, green, yellow, and black.

01:16:53.804 --> 01:16:54.445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was it.

01:16:54.505 --> 01:16:54.725
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:16:56.366 --> 01:16:59.448
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the history lesson, Mr. Loki.

01:16:59.909 --> 01:17:08.014
[SPEAKER_04]: The ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64 versions also were rather limited.

01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:10.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, there were different things added.

01:17:10.816 --> 01:17:19.061
[SPEAKER_04]: The Master System version retold the story from the perspective of Axe Battler, who was called Tarek in that game, and it's only one player.

01:17:19.961 --> 01:17:23.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Axe was also released by Telnet for the PC Engine.

01:17:24.584 --> 01:17:28.946
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was like super resampled music, cut scenes, you name it.

01:17:29.006 --> 01:17:31.708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very, very freaking good version of that game.

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:43.733
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the fact that the music cut out, but I'm trying to find a YouTube clip of Golden Axe CGA because I found a YouTube clip of 39 DOS retro games in CGA.

01:17:44.894 --> 01:17:45.814
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Deanna Jones.

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:47.775
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know they had DuckTales in CGA.

01:17:49.376 --> 01:17:50.456
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, it was purple.

01:17:50.716 --> 01:17:50.977
Yeah.

01:17:52.257 --> 01:17:54.538
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I will continue while Rob's looking for that.

01:17:55.399 --> 01:18:04.884
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also a handheld TV game of the arcade legend Sega Genesis Volume 1 and an enhanced remake that came out on PS2 as part of the Sega Ages line, which we came close to getting.

01:18:04.984 --> 01:18:07.565
[SPEAKER_07]: Was the Skater Die guy supposed to be Rodney Dangerfield?

01:18:07.585 --> 01:18:10.647
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I swear to God, I swear to God it's Rodney Dangerfield.

01:18:10.867 --> 01:18:11.568
[SPEAKER_04]: No respect.

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:12.308
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, never mind.

01:18:12.928 --> 01:18:16.710
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I didn't mean to derail with another game, but it was an important question that had to be asked.

01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:18.992
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give you... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:18:19.052 --> 01:18:19.732
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the answer!

01:18:20.412 --> 01:18:20.873
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the...

01:18:21.753 --> 01:18:24.794
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the red, green, yellow, black palette.

01:18:24.874 --> 01:18:25.975
[SPEAKER_07]: There is Golden Axe.

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:27.916
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look too terrible for what it is.

01:18:29.276 --> 01:18:31.217
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's not the actual audio.

01:18:31.237 --> 01:18:31.917
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just from the video.

01:18:31.937 --> 01:18:32.878
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is Golden Axe.

01:18:32.898 --> 01:18:35.139
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't look that bad.

01:18:35.239 --> 01:18:38.260
[SPEAKER_07]: They did some pretty crazy shit with four colors back in the day.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.181
[SPEAKER_07]: You should see strip poker CGA.

01:18:40.601 --> 01:18:41.521
[SPEAKER_07]: I have.

01:18:41.882 --> 01:18:42.722
Of course you have.

01:18:42.842 --> 01:18:45.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a little factoid with my history with this game.

01:18:46.183 --> 01:18:49.985
[SPEAKER_04]: The second game I ever played on a Sega Saturn, Rob, was Golden Axe The Duel.

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:51.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

01:18:52.031 --> 01:18:57.121
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the first game I played was this crappy Gundam game that came out my friend imported.

01:18:58.304 --> 01:18:59.707
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, there you go.

01:18:59.767 --> 01:19:00.489
[SPEAKER_04]: Best classic game.

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Axe.

01:19:02.453 --> 01:19:02.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Papow.

01:19:04.676 --> 01:19:07.477
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, now I'm looking up... Oh my god.

01:19:08.737 --> 01:19:09.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:11.057
[SPEAKER_07]: It's strip poker on the Commodore 64.

01:19:11.157 --> 01:19:12.658
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, Rob.

01:19:14.398 --> 01:19:15.978
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to put that porn away.

01:19:16.158 --> 01:19:18.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those strip poker games may have for shareware.

01:19:18.339 --> 01:19:22.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody should flag this video for being disgusting.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.340
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I see some bush.

01:19:27.921 --> 01:19:28.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the 80s.

01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:31.942
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why it's so...

01:19:33.303 --> 01:19:34.885
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know exactly why it's so funny.

01:19:35.165 --> 01:19:37.849
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, do you find pubes really funny?

01:19:40.532 --> 01:19:47.760
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, I'm laughing because it just happened to be at the moment I was looking at the video, it said, my hand, as in a poker reference.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.903
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I'm like, her hand looks like it's in her butt.

01:19:52.644 --> 01:19:53.644
[SPEAKER_07]: She's getting herself ready.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:54.645
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't be calling it.

01:19:54.785 --> 01:19:57.205
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I will actually post that.

01:19:57.285 --> 01:19:59.785
[SPEAKER_07]: See, Alpha Cananogram is demanding links.

01:20:00.205 --> 01:20:01.246
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go in the chat room.

01:20:01.266 --> 01:20:01.626
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

01:20:01.646 --> 01:20:04.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're on the illegal episode of Orange On Radio.

01:20:04.126 --> 01:20:07.007
[SPEAKER_07]: Strip poker in all its Commodore 64 glory.

01:20:07.027 --> 01:20:08.387
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll share porn with the kids too.

01:20:12.528 --> 01:20:15.888
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm also asking Rama to tumble this with a parental advisory.

01:20:16.088 --> 01:20:16.728
[SPEAKER_07]: Good lord.

01:20:20.329 --> 01:20:20.669
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.060
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

01:20:24.221 --> 01:20:24.922
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

01:20:25.202 --> 01:20:29.505
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for Part A. We need to take a break and clean up our act.

01:20:29.906 --> 01:20:32.228
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very dirty, illegal show tonight.

01:20:33.088 --> 01:20:36.651
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's plenty more to come in Part B. We've got more Wii U to talk about.

01:20:36.931 --> 01:20:40.994
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about sales figures over Black Light Friday.

01:20:41.395 --> 01:20:42.335
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Friday.

01:20:42.876 --> 01:20:50.582
[SPEAKER_07]: And more news on Ouya and some Nintendo rumors when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:20:57.142 --> 01:21:06.505
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this December the 2nd of 2012 with the 484th episode of our podcast.

01:21:06.525 --> 01:21:08.486
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to hit 500 early next year.

01:21:08.526 --> 01:21:09.026
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you believe it?

01:21:09.486 --> 01:21:11.947
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to plan something special, like for real this time.

01:21:12.447 --> 01:21:18.009
[SPEAKER_07]: Like even bigger than our 10th anniversary show, which was just like people visiting from far away coming to see the show.

01:21:18.309 --> 01:21:21.090
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to plan something huge for our 500th episode.

01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:22.931
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what, but something.

01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:26.052
[SPEAKER_07]: that can be done on a very low budget.

01:21:26.992 --> 01:21:29.032
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to throw ourselves a party at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:21:30.173 --> 01:21:31.633
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about what can fit in the budget.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:35.574
[SPEAKER_07]: How will THQ bundle theme codes for everyone?

01:21:38.295 --> 01:21:40.576
[SPEAKER_07]: Resell keys to the bundle.

01:21:40.676 --> 01:21:41.516
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's terrible.

01:21:41.536 --> 01:21:42.076
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awful.

01:21:42.256 --> 01:21:43.396
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare you even suggest that?

01:21:44.597 --> 01:21:45.337
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll figure something out.

01:21:45.437 --> 01:21:47.197
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR Kickstarter for OLRCon.

01:21:47.837 --> 01:21:48.938
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't know.

01:21:49.858 --> 01:21:52.839
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it would be more appropriate to have the party at Roseville Golf Land.

01:21:53.559 --> 01:22:01.811
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that the other night, you know, Saturday night was kind of a blood day, but there was a break in the storms and Alan and I were kind of going, what should we do?

01:22:01.871 --> 01:22:02.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we even go do something?

01:22:02.892 --> 01:22:03.413
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want to do?

01:22:04.014 --> 01:22:06.598
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was actually suggested, should we go to Roseville Golf Land?

01:22:07.219 --> 01:22:09.262
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were like, what would we do?

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.080
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll figure something out.

01:22:32.349 --> 01:22:34.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, but no breaks in the near future coming.

01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:39.092
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as we know, we're going to keep doing an episode every week on Into 2013.

01:22:39.853 --> 01:22:43.495
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming, of course, the world does not end in a couple weeks, although we all know it won't.

01:22:43.615 --> 01:22:43.935
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

01:22:44.275 --> 01:22:45.576
[SPEAKER_07]: The media needs something to report on.

01:22:45.596 --> 01:22:48.718
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

01:22:49.338 --> 01:22:49.638
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:22:50.239 --> 01:22:54.381
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about something I mentioned during my gaming week, which is...

01:22:55.218 --> 01:22:58.381
[SPEAKER_06]: and Skrillex.

01:22:59.002 --> 01:23:01.504
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear, that's like a tongue twister for me.

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:04.566
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically kind of a combination of a bunch of different things.

01:23:06.488 --> 01:23:15.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Retro, like NES games, because the whole thing, the premise of it is that there's this piece of dust that falls onto an NES cartridge and...

01:23:16.196 --> 01:23:19.877
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what happens when that dust corrupts everything in the game.

01:23:20.638 --> 01:23:28.100
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you're kind of playing this Link-type character that's kind of done in this sword and sorcery-type art.

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:35.722
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're fighting glitches that are in the game and trying to save this sort of princess thing.

01:23:36.683 --> 01:23:38.383
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty cool.

01:23:39.324 --> 01:23:40.144
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a free game.

01:23:40.744 --> 01:23:42.585
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check it out on...

01:23:44.145 --> 01:23:50.333
[SPEAKER_06]: on their website, which, let's see here, which I don't remember the hell it is, but...

01:23:52.492 --> 01:23:52.992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.

01:23:53.052 --> 01:23:58.756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done by, like I said, the guy that did the Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now game, the Perfect Strangers one, Jason Oda.

01:23:58.796 --> 01:24:01.838
[SPEAKER_06]: He kind of specializes in adver games.

01:24:02.879 --> 01:24:04.880
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yes, so check this out.

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:07.962
[SPEAKER_06]: It's SkrillexQuest.com.

01:24:08.862 --> 01:24:10.223
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty easy to find that.

01:24:11.604 --> 01:24:17.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Another kind of indie game that's getting a really unasked-for sequel is

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:42.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Barclay Shut Up and Jam Gaiden is getting the sequel entitled The Magical Realms of Tyrna Nog Escape from Necron 7 Revenge of Cthulhu and the Official Game of the Movie Chapter 2 of the Hoops Barclay Saga or Barclay 2

01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:45.051
[SPEAKER_06]: For short, it's being kickstarted right now.

01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:50.232
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be honest, I mean, I remember seeing some of the stuff for Barclay Shut Up and Jam Gaiden.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.753
[SPEAKER_06]: And this looks nothing like it.

01:24:52.213 --> 01:24:55.033
[SPEAKER_06]: This just looks like kind of this weird cyberpunk game.

01:24:56.494 --> 01:24:59.055
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're looking for $35,000 on Kickstarter.

01:24:59.155 --> 01:25:04.056
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the bonuses include all sorts of weird things, including a Cyberdwarf body pillow.

01:25:04.376 --> 01:25:07.457
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you know, game downloads, soundtrack, and that kind of stuff.

01:25:09.761 --> 01:25:10.622
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's interesting.

01:25:10.882 --> 01:25:15.525
[SPEAKER_06]: And then last but not least, Dishonored doing pretty well in retail market.

01:25:15.905 --> 01:25:26.033
[SPEAKER_06]: Their sales have exceeded the expectations of Bethesda, so I guess that means we're going to see another series of games or another franchise from Bethesda, which is fine.

01:25:26.073 --> 01:25:27.954
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was a pretty awesome game.

01:25:28.254 --> 01:25:55.272
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently it sold 460,000 copies in North America during October and of course the sales figures I think for November obviously haven't been released yet because we just got into December so we'll have to see what it did you know competing up against Assassin's Creed and well actually I guess we saw a little bit of Assassin's Creed sales in there but you know more Assassin's Creed 3 sales and Halo 4 and Black Ops 2 yeah

01:25:58.345 --> 01:26:02.848
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, moving on to a game I talked about last week, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed.

01:26:15.817 --> 01:26:20.942
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, some boost pads that are supposed to be there, that are there in the other versions of the game, not there.

01:26:21.422 --> 01:26:23.184
[SPEAKER_07]: No wonder I couldn't beat it when I played it.

01:26:23.224 --> 01:26:24.205
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, this is too hard.

01:26:24.545 --> 01:26:30.270
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought maybe I needed to do more drifting to get those boosts, but I guess there really was a bug.

01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.614
[SPEAKER_07]: So the patch has already been sent to Nintendo for review.

01:26:34.995 --> 01:26:36.456
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm assuming that means it will be out very soon.

01:26:36.476 --> 01:26:37.657
[SPEAKER_06]: You just weren't snaking enough.

01:26:37.957 --> 01:26:39.219
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess not, which...

01:26:39.979 --> 01:26:41.560
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's something you can do.

01:26:42.081 --> 01:26:45.283
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do it to the level you can do it in Mario Kart, but it's possible.

01:26:46.364 --> 01:26:52.789
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, speaking of Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed, there is going to be DLC for the game at some point, especially on 360 and PlayStation 3 versus the game.

01:26:55.651 --> 01:26:59.695
[SPEAKER_07]: But folks in the community were throwing out ideas for DLC.

01:27:00.335 --> 01:27:05.180
[SPEAKER_07]: And executive producer Steve Lysette with Sumo Digital, who made the game, put out a challenge.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:20.374
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, Without any policing from the Sumo or Sega crew, if you can all agree on three characters by the 1st of December and prove there is sufficient interest of at least 1,000 unique people per character, I will present the result to Sega.

01:27:20.874 --> 01:27:42.749
[SPEAKER_07]: the fans delivered separate change.org petitions for the following characters for these three current leaders Hatsune Miku Project Diva that's a great choice Ryo Hazuki no from Shenmue no surprise there Segata Sanshiro Segata Sanshiro

01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:45.854
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sega Saturn mascot, if you weren't already aware.

01:27:45.874 --> 01:27:46.615
[SPEAKER_07]: He's awesome!

01:27:46.716 --> 01:27:51.103
[SPEAKER_07]: No guarantees that those three characters will be included, but those are some pretty bitchin' choices.

01:27:51.123 --> 01:27:54.930
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that they do include Ryo, that they include him driving a forklift.

01:27:58.775 --> 01:28:01.579
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope when he takes somebody out, he'll be, there's your game of lucky hit.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.361
[SPEAKER_07]: Asshole.

01:28:04.743 --> 01:28:08.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to some other- I want to see, like, Echo the Dolphin or something like that.

01:28:08.547 --> 01:28:14.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Something ridiculous that just won't work, you know, or, I don't know.

01:28:16.197 --> 01:28:17.459
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have ToeJam & Earl in there?

01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:19.031
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

01:28:19.531 --> 01:28:21.512
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still a lot of great Sega characters they could use.

01:28:21.572 --> 01:28:27.515
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, moving on to other Nintendo news about the Wii U. In an interview with IGN, Satoru Iwata said, You know what?

01:28:27.536 --> 01:28:31.898
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not interested in emulating online services like Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.

01:28:31.938 --> 01:28:34.620
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go again with that whole, we gotta be different.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.960
[SPEAKER_07]: The jokes write themselves.

01:28:36.581 --> 01:28:38.302
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me read the quote, then you make the joke.

01:28:39.002 --> 01:28:39.643
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

01:29:05.697 --> 01:29:06.980
[SPEAKER_07]: Me-verse is something different.

01:29:17.211 --> 01:29:20.233
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not done on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:20.914
[SPEAKER_06]: It is different.

01:29:21.194 --> 01:29:25.317
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you totally missed the whole underlying statement here that they've totally put forth.

01:29:25.758 --> 01:29:28.580
[SPEAKER_06]: They want you to buy one for each member of your family.

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.362
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's only one gamepad for that console.

01:29:31.522 --> 01:29:35.025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because each member of your family should own one in their own separate rooms.

01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:35.545
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:37.126
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll connect via the internet.

01:29:37.367 --> 01:29:39.468
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you know that's why the Wii Mini exists?

01:29:39.748 --> 01:29:40.769
[SPEAKER_07]: The Canadian Wii Mini?

01:29:40.849 --> 01:29:42.611
[SPEAKER_07]: So that every kid's bedroom can have one.

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:43.431
[SPEAKER_06]: Outro Music

01:30:01.502 --> 01:30:01.922
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:30:02.943 --> 01:30:03.603
[SPEAKER_06]: That game's terrible.

01:30:05.204 --> 01:30:06.584
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't there supposed to be a Wii Fit U?

01:30:07.464 --> 01:30:07.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there is.

01:30:08.365 --> 01:30:08.805
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is it?

01:30:09.345 --> 01:30:10.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Launch Window.

01:30:10.306 --> 01:30:12.066
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, they still have six more years.

01:30:12.166 --> 01:30:13.507
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

01:30:13.667 --> 01:30:14.267
[SPEAKER_06]: Launch Window.

01:30:14.567 --> 01:30:16.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Launch Window is such bullshit.

01:30:16.108 --> 01:30:18.369
[SPEAKER_06]: Launch Window should be that week that's coming out.

01:30:18.409 --> 01:30:22.010
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if it launches on Sunday, hey, I understand that all games are not going to stream on Sunday.

01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.411
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a month.

01:30:23.331 --> 01:30:25.752
[SPEAKER_07]: From launch to Christmas would have been Launch Window to me.

01:30:26.556 --> 01:30:31.221
[SPEAKER_06]: Launch a window is not fucking your fiscal year that the launch happens to take place in.

01:30:31.681 --> 01:30:32.102
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like...

01:30:33.393 --> 01:30:38.077
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like calling a hole blown into your wall that's the entire side of your house.

01:30:38.117 --> 01:30:42.240
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the launch window for investors only, the people that Nintendo's really trying to speak to.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.663
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like calling the wall missing in a dollhouse a window.

01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:50.547
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Me-verse is very unique.

01:30:50.667 --> 01:30:53.870
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's cool people can write and stuff directly from the gamepad.

01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:56.592
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if I had it, I wouldn't be able to draw on it.

01:30:56.712 --> 01:30:58.994
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't draw Jack's shit, only stick figures.

01:30:59.514 --> 01:31:08.340
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I gotta admit, the whole Miiverse thing, as much as I do love it, I think it's great, and the community element and so forth, it really reminds me how bad of a drawer I am.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:14.004
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to draw one for one of the levels I beat in Mario, and it's just, it's not, it's not good.

01:31:15.205 --> 01:31:21.048
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a good artist at all, and the Wii U makes me feel insignificant.

01:31:22.569 --> 01:31:28.313
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think this is gonna be very popular until it goes away, a PictoChat where everyone's just kinda like,

01:31:30.396 --> 01:31:30.677
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm over it.

01:31:30.697 --> 01:31:33.845
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe internet PictoChat's not a thing, but I guess Nintendo can't police that.

01:31:33.865 --> 01:31:35.529
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

01:31:35.549 --> 01:31:36.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Penises everywhere.

01:31:36.411 --> 01:31:37.333
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about the children.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:44.804
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the places Nintendo was getting slammed with the launch of the Wii U console was that you can't really move your Nintendo Network account.

01:31:45.224 --> 01:31:51.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, some clarity's come forth this week through somebody who sent their bricked Wii U system into Nintendo.

01:31:52.168 --> 01:31:59.332
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, in turn, sent them back a brand new console that was allowing them to sign in to their previously made Nintendo Network account.

01:31:59.692 --> 01:32:00.573
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's the answer.

01:32:00.613 --> 01:32:04.935
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to move your Nintendo ID from one console to another, just send it into Nintendo.

01:32:04.955 --> 01:32:05.756
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll do it for you.

01:32:06.096 --> 01:32:07.017
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cost-effective.

01:32:07.917 --> 01:32:33.708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming, especially if they launch Wii U's That's the way they did it with the Wii When they launch Wii U's in other colors and other shapes and all this other stuff There'll be a way to do it in the future There'll be a move me channel or something It's just stupid It is a little ridiculous It's just like, hey, features that are helpful, eh, fuck that, we're different We don't want to emulate the guys that actually have functioning online services We're just gonna, we're gonna wing it

01:32:34.255 --> 01:32:35.316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our, we're going to wing it.

01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:39.038
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try to create something that's more like, you know, social and stuff.

01:32:39.498 --> 01:32:40.318
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, patches.

01:32:40.678 --> 01:32:44.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, uh, uh, online connectivity.

01:32:45.441 --> 01:32:49.003
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, well, yeah, I don't know.

01:32:52.423 --> 01:32:56.325
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Bobby in our chatroom, Bobby Blackwolf says, I drew something that said I couldn't draw.

01:32:56.486 --> 01:32:57.506
[SPEAKER_07]: I got yaz for it.

01:32:57.566 --> 01:33:02.469
[SPEAKER_07]: My stick figure flipped a table and a stick kitty told me to please be reasonable with the table.

01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:04.250
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen that drawing yet.

01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:05.351
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to log on to Miiverse.

01:33:06.472 --> 01:33:07.793
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

01:33:07.813 --> 01:33:08.233
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

01:33:11.248 --> 01:33:11.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, hold on.

01:33:11.868 --> 01:33:12.469
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there we go.

01:33:13.329 --> 01:33:14.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, uh... Hold on to what?

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Shush.

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:16.810
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Super Mario Bros.

01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:18.351
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 is getting Super Mario Bros.

01:33:18.391 --> 01:33:19.211
[SPEAKER_04]: and Super Mario Bros.

01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:21.712
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 levels and they are available now.

01:33:22.312 --> 01:33:27.374
[SPEAKER_04]: They're through, uh, looks like free Coin Rush content and is now available to download.

01:33:27.954 --> 01:33:29.575
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good for people who have that.

01:33:30.655 --> 01:33:31.795
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay for DLC, right?

01:33:31.895 --> 01:33:32.556
[SPEAKER_04]: After that's gonna be $2.50.

01:33:34.517 --> 01:33:56.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Then for the Vita, there is going to be a PlayStation Plus bundle So it's going to be $300 And it will have the PlayStation Plus Instant Game Collection And it will be a Black 3G Wi-Fi Vita, a year of Plus And a voucher for download of Unit 13 and a 4GB memory card

01:33:58.206 --> 01:34:02.368
[SPEAKER_04]: and last but not least, Stern is bringing out Avengers Pinball.

01:34:02.528 --> 01:34:03.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

01:34:03.888 --> 01:34:08.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, I mean, we all saw that coming anyway because Stern is basically the only releaser of pinball games now.

01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:12.311
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, it will hopefully be a good table.

01:34:12.912 --> 01:34:13.812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep my fingers crossed.

01:34:16.193 --> 01:34:18.634
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:34:26.769 --> 01:34:28.550
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook plus Google.

01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:30.812
[SPEAKER_07]: Slam them together and you get Google.

01:34:31.292 --> 01:34:34.494
[SPEAKER_07]: And we ask a question on our social network communities every week.

01:34:35.114 --> 01:34:36.475
[SPEAKER_07]: This week is the following.

01:34:37.176 --> 01:34:39.377
[SPEAKER_07]: What is on your gamer's Christmas list?

01:34:39.797 --> 01:34:41.819
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Hanukkah, Festivus, whatever it is you observe.

01:34:42.599 --> 01:34:43.299
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's it.

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.161
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty simple question with the holidays coming up.

01:34:45.201 --> 01:34:51.785
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to know what people are asking for from Santa Claus and Hanukkah Harry and their Festivus pole and the moon or whatever it is.

01:34:52.285 --> 01:34:54.948
[SPEAKER_07]: So, starting off with some of the answers from Facebook.

01:34:55.048 --> 01:34:56.270
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of answers tonight.

01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:57.291
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't read them all.

01:34:57.431 --> 01:35:01.275
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read some of the names I don't usually see in chat.

01:35:01.375 --> 01:35:07.923
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkCharger says, While I wasn't quite willing to pull the trigger myself, I wouldn't mind if Santa put a Wii U under the tree.

01:35:09.844 --> 01:35:24.292
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not gonna buy a Wii U James S replied and said I have my eye on PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale but other than that I believe next year will be exponentially better possibly even new consoles from Sony and Microsoft

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:33.919
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we didn't get into it in tonight's news, and we're not going to, but the Microsoft rumors were taken off again about the new console.

01:35:33.939 --> 01:35:37.322
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it even showed up on my Google News feed.

01:35:37.382 --> 01:35:45.468
[SPEAKER_07]: Just more rumors about Microsoft launching in holiday 2013, and I always kind of thought that was a given.

01:35:46.428 --> 01:35:48.470
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just someone else saying the same thing again.

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:49.951
[SPEAKER_07]: Investors picking up on it.

01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:55.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we think they're gonna, we're an analyst and we think that they're gonna launch a new console, you know, next year.

01:35:56.677 --> 01:35:57.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

01:35:57.398 --> 01:35:59.399
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if I say that, no one fucking cares.

01:35:59.579 --> 01:36:02.682
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the part that surprised me about that story.

01:36:02.722 --> 01:36:07.386
[SPEAKER_07]: The part that was news and interesting is that they may not unveil it at E3.

01:36:07.907 --> 01:36:11.490
[SPEAKER_07]: They may do their own event, which, it makes sense.

01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:11.970
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:13.531
[SPEAKER_07]: They can get away with it.

01:36:13.992 --> 01:36:14.712
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo does it.

01:36:15.452 --> 01:36:18.393
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they do E3, but instead of Tokyo Game Show, they do their own thing.

01:36:18.473 --> 01:36:19.934
[SPEAKER_07]: Why shouldn't Microsoft do their own thing?

01:36:21.354 --> 01:36:23.195
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually think that's a great idea.

01:36:23.835 --> 01:36:32.138
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, as long as it's before E3, because unveil the console before E3 and then make E3 about what, everybody?

01:36:32.378 --> 01:36:32.619
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:36:32.719 --> 01:36:32.979
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:36:33.379 --> 01:36:33.999
[SPEAKER_07]: The games.

01:36:34.179 --> 01:36:34.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live.

01:36:35.019 --> 01:36:35.120
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

01:36:36.901 --> 01:36:37.842
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo 5?

01:36:38.063 --> 01:36:38.864
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love that.

01:36:39.124 --> 01:36:41.427
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love it if E3 could actually be about the game.

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:43.410
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:36:44.512 --> 01:36:47.376
[SPEAKER_07]: Oop, I guess the music was too loud in that previous segment.

01:36:47.416 --> 01:36:49.740
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I thought it was at its usual volume.

01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:50.340
[SPEAKER_07]: My bad.

01:36:51.342 --> 01:36:52.303
[SPEAKER_07]: Live radio, it's fun.

01:36:53.144 --> 01:36:53.904
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard myself.

01:36:54.024 --> 01:36:55.405
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:36:55.505 --> 01:36:55.925
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

01:36:57.665 --> 01:37:03.967
[SPEAKER_07]: Burr replied and said, I'm terrible and that I've already bought everything I wanted for myself, like a Wii U and whatnot.

01:37:04.388 --> 01:37:09.029
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love a Steam sale on Borderlands 2 DLC or Mass Effect 3 DLC, however.

01:37:09.758 --> 01:37:15.520
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing about growing up is that you kind of end up buying yourself all the stuff you want.

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.621
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I bought myself a Wii U. That was kind of my early Christmas present to myself.

01:37:18.641 --> 01:37:20.502
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really expecting anything else from anyone.

01:37:20.982 --> 01:37:22.502
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I wanted it.

01:37:22.542 --> 01:37:22.983
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought it.

01:37:23.483 --> 01:37:24.223
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy holidays.

01:37:26.844 --> 01:37:30.665
[SPEAKER_07]: Degenerate Johnny said, To be honest, I've been pretty disappointed with this fall's lineup of games.

01:37:31.025 --> 01:37:38.288
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, my holiday list will consist of paid-off pre-orders of next year's games, such as Dead Space 3 as well as Bioshock Infinite.

01:37:39.448 --> 01:37:44.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiara from geek-life.com said, I need the new Skyrim DLC, Dragonborn.

01:37:45.010 --> 01:37:47.431
[SPEAKER_07]: No, really, I need it for reasons.

01:37:49.432 --> 01:37:49.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

01:37:51.073 --> 01:37:58.956
[SPEAKER_07]: Critical Myth replied and said, Assassin's Creed 3, PlayStation Vita with Assassin's Creed Liberation, and a couple of memory cards, Mass Effect Trilogy.

01:37:58.996 --> 01:38:00.117
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the big ticket items.

01:38:00.857 --> 01:38:04.919
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dave Falcon said, Assassin's Creed 3 for my fiance for Hanukkah.

01:38:05.979 --> 01:38:07.461
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what you bought somebody else.

01:38:07.541 --> 01:38:10.143
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't know what you wanted under your tree, but I guess that works.

01:38:11.925 --> 01:38:12.305
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

01:38:12.405 --> 01:38:16.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to our Google Plus community.

01:38:18.516 --> 01:38:20.538
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few comments here, so I'll read these.

01:38:21.279 --> 01:38:24.943
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, I want an HDTV to play games in HD.

01:38:25.163 --> 01:38:27.405
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still rocking a 15-inch SDTV.

01:38:28.166 --> 01:38:31.129
[SPEAKER_07]: A 3DS, since it's turning out to be a solid console now.

01:38:32.630 --> 01:38:34.092
[SPEAKER_07]: Forza Horizon Season Pass.

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:35.934
[SPEAKER_07]: King of Fighters 13 for 360.

01:38:37.195 --> 01:38:39.237
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free on PlayStation Plus, just saying.

01:38:39.702 --> 01:38:41.843
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I guess PlayStation Plus isn't free, but whatever.

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:47.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Zone to the Ender's HD, everything on my Steam wish list, RAM for my PC.

01:38:47.987 --> 01:38:49.948
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a big list, Actdeft.

01:38:51.429 --> 01:38:52.550
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well, lots of options, right?

01:38:53.210 --> 01:38:55.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Monster B wants the following for Christmas.

01:38:55.191 --> 01:39:00.775
[SPEAKER_07]: A PlayStation 3 controller charging station and a Steam gift card to help support my addiction in 2013.

01:39:00.855 --> 01:39:03.336
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about 2013?

01:39:03.376 --> 01:39:05.137
[SPEAKER_07]: That winter sale will still be going on in 2012.

01:39:07.887 --> 01:39:19.473
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, AJ Twist replied and said, King of Fighters 13 on PlayStation 3, a PlayStation 3 arcade stick, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 4, Turtles in Time on the Super Nintendo.

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:20.974
[SPEAKER_07]: Good pick.

01:39:21.995 --> 01:39:22.415
[SPEAKER_07]: Good pick.

01:39:22.655 --> 01:39:22.895
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:24.956
[SPEAKER_07]: That does it for the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:39:25.937 --> 01:39:27.938
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, do you have any holiday gaming wishes?

01:39:29.059 --> 01:39:29.419
[SPEAKER_07]: Garrus.

01:39:30.379 --> 01:39:30.659
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.040
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.220
[SPEAKER_07]: You even replied on Facebook.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.501
[SPEAKER_07]: You want your Garrus figure, right?

01:39:33.621 --> 01:39:33.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

01:39:34.502 --> 01:39:35.002
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's that from?

01:39:36.181 --> 01:39:41.610
[SPEAKER_07]: Play Arts Did you see the Mass Effect museum style artwork that they were selling?

01:39:41.710 --> 01:39:44.174
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see very big pictures of it, but it's okay.

01:39:44.274 --> 01:39:44.875
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked nice.

01:39:45.636 --> 01:39:46.217
[SPEAKER_07]: Me wanty.

01:39:47.619 --> 01:39:49.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, anything on your holiday list?

01:39:49.442 --> 01:39:50.383
[SPEAKER_06]: I really pretty much...

01:39:51.585 --> 01:39:59.488
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the last console game I'm going to get.

01:39:59.508 --> 01:40:04.309
[SPEAKER_06]: A year to PlayStation Plus would be kind of cool because I don't really want to pay for that.

01:40:04.570 --> 01:40:06.750
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if I would really use that.

01:40:08.631 --> 01:40:17.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Raspberry Pi, but trying to explain that to anybody would be difficult for them to understand what the hell I was talking about.

01:40:17.514 --> 01:40:18.134
[SPEAKER_06]: You want pie?

01:40:18.194 --> 01:40:18.954
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you didn't like pie.

01:40:18.974 --> 01:40:19.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

01:40:22.719 --> 01:40:24.120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that'd pretty much be it.

01:40:25.041 --> 01:40:32.547
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, it's funny, our family, we kind of draw names, you know, just get gifts for one person except for, you know, Josh gets gifts for everybody.

01:40:34.088 --> 01:40:36.209
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife, she's like, oh, I hope I get your name.

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:41.213
[SPEAKER_06]: She's all, you know, instead of, you know, your mom or something like that because I don't know what to get them.

01:40:41.674 --> 01:40:44.176
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she got my name and she's like, I'm not getting you anything.

01:40:46.457 --> 01:40:46.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, thanks.

01:40:46.878 --> 01:40:47.818
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, nice.

01:40:47.858 --> 01:40:48.399
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy holidays.

01:40:48.799 --> 01:40:50.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe it'll be a surprise if she does get you something.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:52.481
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hold your breath.

01:40:52.661 --> 01:40:53.663
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not holding my breath.

01:40:55.946 --> 01:41:05.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I pretty much bought everything I wanted, but I wouldn't mind if I got an iCade or even one of these things I don't think I would ever buy myself, but if it showed up, I'd be kind of happy.

01:41:05.619 --> 01:41:07.522
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be one of those Atari flashback consoles.

01:41:07.862 --> 01:41:08.762
[SPEAKER_07]: I like retro shit.

01:41:08.882 --> 01:41:10.403
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think they sell those anymore.

01:41:10.563 --> 01:41:11.504
[SPEAKER_07]: They do at Toys R Us.

01:41:11.524 --> 01:41:12.484
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw one the other day.

01:41:12.724 --> 01:41:14.965
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured they'd have old ass inventory.

01:41:15.045 --> 01:41:17.746
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like the three, the flashback threes or whatever the newest ones are.

01:41:19.427 --> 01:41:20.247
[SPEAKER_07]: I like retro shit.

01:41:20.747 --> 01:41:21.308
[SPEAKER_07]: It amuses me.

01:41:21.768 --> 01:41:26.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a Ben Heck Xbox 360 laptop would be fucking awesome.

01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:28.250
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a working Commodore 64.

01:41:30.112 --> 01:41:33.656
[SPEAKER_07]: to hook up to my TV, which I don't even think you could do without some major converters.

01:41:33.716 --> 01:41:35.078
[SPEAKER_07]: But damn it, I would try it.

01:41:36.059 --> 01:41:36.640
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

01:41:37.201 --> 01:41:38.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, don't they have like an RF adapter?

01:41:39.083 --> 01:41:42.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well... They have the... Well, it's UHF, right?

01:41:43.269 --> 01:41:45.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was... Well, they have the UHF to RF.

01:41:45.792 --> 01:41:46.553
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to have this.

01:41:46.753 --> 01:41:52.517
[SPEAKER_07]: You could hook up a Commodore 64 through RF adapter or something that was very similar to RCA plugs.

01:41:53.058 --> 01:41:56.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for one video and two audio, there was two video and one audio.

01:41:56.901 --> 01:42:01.524
[SPEAKER_07]: So they didn't cross work, but you could probably get a converter for those too.

01:42:01.564 --> 01:42:05.727
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Commodore 64 monitors were RGB, like arcade monitors.

01:42:05.948 --> 01:42:11.212
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a converter board for that to play arcade games on your TV.

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:17.202
[SPEAKER_07]: Alpha Cananogram in our chatroom says, Rob, it's an Atari Flashback 4 with wireless controls now.

01:42:17.302 --> 01:42:17.942
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I had no idea.

01:42:18.383 --> 01:42:18.803
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

01:42:18.883 --> 01:42:19.363
[SPEAKER_07]: I want one.

01:42:20.324 --> 01:42:20.884
[SPEAKER_07]: Gimme, gimme.

01:42:20.944 --> 01:42:21.685
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it all.

01:42:22.505 --> 01:42:24.086
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

01:42:24.766 --> 01:42:34.132
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, Zynga and Facebook have been pretty chummy for a while now, but now they're trying to read, you know, set out new terms as far as their partnership goes.

01:42:34.572 --> 01:42:40.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, what's going to happen is they're going to have some opportunities to have Facebook to have kind of official Facebook games and

01:42:41.496 --> 01:43:10.163
[SPEAKER_06]: and also it'll also kind of tie in with Zynga will still I guess use Facebook's payment system but they're gonna kind of try to I guess we'll find a way to separate a little bit they're gonna allow it's gonna allow each of the parties like Zynga to promote game their own games that they create and also I guess before they were required to use I guess Facebook's monetization platform

01:43:10.803 --> 01:43:16.265
[SPEAKER_06]: and now Facebook could make their own games to compete with FarmVille and stuff.

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:26.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the way I see this is there's so many FarmVille and those types of game clones.

01:43:26.627 --> 01:43:31.889
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Facebook came out with the official Facebook farming game.

01:43:31.929 --> 01:43:33.209
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone would give a shit.

01:43:33.349 --> 01:43:37.370
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be just like if EA came out with a farming game.

01:43:37.710 --> 01:43:39.011
[SPEAKER_06]: No one would care.

01:43:39.911 --> 01:43:42.152
[SPEAKER_07]: Insert my typical Facebook rant here.

01:43:42.432 --> 01:43:43.993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just... I'm so over Facebook.

01:43:44.433 --> 01:43:49.034
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was talking to somebody on my Facebook tonight about why I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook.

01:43:49.054 --> 01:43:51.915
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was even a post I saw on Twitter that kind of talked about this.

01:43:51.995 --> 01:43:58.718
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really do like... I just... I... Right now, as of late, I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook because...

01:43:59.938 --> 01:44:02.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though there are offensive things on Twitter, don't get me wrong.

01:44:02.659 --> 01:44:13.722
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, people tend to offend a lot less on Twitter, and I think it's, like, the character restriction kind of is, you know, tighter there, so you have to really think before you post.

01:44:14.142 --> 01:44:19.143
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, people aren't as forthright to just spew stuff all over, and I don't know.

01:44:19.324 --> 01:44:19.704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

01:44:20.224 --> 01:44:20.844
[SPEAKER_07]: I loves Twitter.

01:44:22.165 --> 01:44:25.206
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not perfect, and there's no games.

01:44:25.647 --> 01:44:26.067
[SPEAKER_07]: No games.

01:44:26.107 --> 01:44:27.428
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that shows up in my feed?

01:44:27.488 --> 01:44:28.308
[SPEAKER_07]: Promoted posts.

01:44:29.169 --> 01:44:30.809
[SPEAKER_07]: And luckily, they're pretty easy to scroll past.

01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:31.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are also on Facebook.

01:44:32.871 --> 01:44:33.211
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

01:44:33.591 --> 01:44:37.633
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the Fugle Question of the Week, I posted it tonight, and Facebook brings up this little pop-up.

01:44:37.953 --> 01:44:39.554
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to promote this post for only $5?

01:44:40.815 --> 01:44:43.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Which made me think, oh, nobody's going to see the Fugle Question of the Week this week.

01:44:44.097 --> 01:44:45.318
[SPEAKER_07]: Which reminds me, listeners...

01:44:46.118 --> 01:44:47.219
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:45:07.418 --> 01:45:07.698
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

01:45:37.094 --> 01:45:38.175
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf says, really?

01:45:38.235 --> 01:45:39.677
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Twitter drama every week.

01:45:40.578 --> 01:45:43.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but in a Michael Jackson eating popcorn gif kind of way.

01:45:43.761 --> 01:45:47.344
[SPEAKER_07]: The good news is it usually doesn't involve me or my friends, so I'm okay with it.

01:45:47.965 --> 01:45:50.648
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter drama is when celebrities say shit, you know.

01:45:52.349 --> 01:45:52.650
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

01:45:54.608 --> 01:45:55.209
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

01:45:55.529 --> 01:45:57.452
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to talk all about social networking.

01:45:58.314 --> 01:45:59.335
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody knows where they stand.

01:46:00.177 --> 01:46:04.924
[SPEAKER_07]: Sales figures coming in from the launch weekend of the Wii U. Excuse me, launch week.

01:46:04.944 --> 01:46:07.027
[SPEAKER_07]: 400,000 Wii U's sold in the first week.

01:46:10.276 --> 01:46:16.620
[SPEAKER_07]: Over that same period, Nintendo sold 300,000 Wii consoles and 500,000 portable devices.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.243
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 1.2 million units sold in the U.S.

01:46:21.643 --> 01:46:39.075
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, it should be noted that the Xbox and PlayStation sales figures came in, and I apologize, I don't have it in front of me, but it was around $700,000, $750,000 for the Xboxes, and I want to say Sony was $700,000 when you combined both the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

01:46:39.475 --> 01:46:44.217
[SPEAKER_07]: Which led a lot of people to say, OMG, Wii U's dead already.

01:46:44.718 --> 01:46:45.498
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii U's dead already.

01:46:45.798 --> 01:46:50.781
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360, a six-year-old console, is outselling the Wii U. Wait a minute.

01:46:51.441 --> 01:46:53.362
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the internet forgetting, Loki?

01:46:53.942 --> 01:46:56.563
[SPEAKER_06]: They're forgetting that that's all that was available.

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:57.544
[SPEAKER_06]: It sold out.

01:46:57.764 --> 01:47:01.426
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just they only made that many consoles available at the time.

01:47:02.066 --> 01:47:03.967
[SPEAKER_06]: You also have to figure if they sold any more of that.

01:47:04.928 --> 01:47:07.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, the first week would have included Black Friday, I would assume.

01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:11.491
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, there's that kind of thrown there.

01:47:11.511 --> 01:47:13.752
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are holding back their consoles until Black Friday.

01:47:13.772 --> 01:47:16.293
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, there's not like Wii U sitting on the shelves.

01:47:16.574 --> 01:47:19.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, they're nowhere to be, you know, at all.

01:47:19.355 --> 01:47:22.357
[SPEAKER_07]: and how did the Xbox 360 sell in its first week?

01:47:22.818 --> 01:47:26.861
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean those things were fucking diamonds to find when they originally came out.

01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:29.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the Xbox 360 launch and how shitty it was?

01:47:29.843 --> 01:47:37.529
[SPEAKER_07]: Like those things were really hard to find so I would bet their sales numbers were not so hot and a lot of that was because of supply and demand as well.

01:47:37.649 --> 01:47:37.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:40.732
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's comparing apples to oranges a little bit.

01:47:40.752 --> 01:47:41.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Well and also

01:47:41.072 --> 01:47:46.613
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, that's a little bit different, too, because, you know, you're talking about a real generation jump there.

01:47:46.673 --> 01:47:51.414
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the first next-gen console, whereas the Wii U is kind of like, it's not really a next-gen console.

01:47:51.434 --> 01:47:56.256
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the graphics aren't like, oh my god, this is like way different than what I'm seeing on the other consoles.

01:47:56.316 --> 01:47:58.156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just... It's Nintendo doing its thing.

01:47:58.316 --> 01:47:58.496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:47:59.996 --> 01:48:02.397
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not, it doesn't have the same impact, I guess.

01:48:04.628 --> 01:48:05.389
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:48:27.205 --> 01:48:28.306
[SPEAKER_07]: They are still showing up.

01:48:28.346 --> 01:48:33.468
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Twitter, haha, I just saw a picture of a bunch of them sitting at a Best Buy that somebody took a picture of.

01:48:33.548 --> 01:48:35.550
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, they are being replenished out there.

01:48:35.690 --> 01:48:39.171
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't think you won't have one for the holidays if you don't want one.

01:48:40.112 --> 01:48:40.832
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still find them.

01:48:42.433 --> 01:48:44.554
[SPEAKER_07]: even if GameStop got rid of their call list.

01:48:44.574 --> 01:48:46.455
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go to GameStop.

01:48:46.475 --> 01:48:49.396
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, because I remember it was when I got the PSP.

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:51.737
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you were with me or not.

01:48:51.757 --> 01:48:53.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you were.

01:48:54.258 --> 01:49:02.962
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, it was when I got the PSP, I went to GameStop, and they're like, oh, good luck finding one of those.

01:49:02.982 --> 01:49:04.323
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never find a PSP.

01:49:04.483 --> 01:49:06.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Went to Best Buy, they had a whole case of them sitting in there.

01:49:07.424 --> 01:49:32.454
[SPEAKER_07]: so yeah I hate the attitude of a lot of people I've seen working there but if you didn't pre-order you're never gonna get that yeah yeah no that's try me bitch or the games I'm not gonna get them on release day if I don't pre-order amazon.com pwned like like be aware of what you're really competing with people anywhere else moving on Dark Sakura

01:49:33.337 --> 01:49:34.979
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we can move on to other news.

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:38.062
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Steam's Greenlight?

01:49:38.122 --> 01:49:39.924
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a third batch of games being accepted.

01:49:41.586 --> 01:49:43.428
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually looked a little bit at Primordia.

01:49:43.508 --> 01:49:45.130
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is Walking Mars.

01:49:45.671 --> 01:49:54.521
[SPEAKER_04]: But Primordia is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi game that Valve actually rejected after several indie titles were pulled in.

01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:59.390
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other one was Walking Mars done by TigerStyle.

01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:05.191
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an OS game and it made App of the Day back for Eurogamer.

01:50:05.731 --> 01:50:06.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know if anyone remembers that.

01:50:07.092 --> 01:50:09.092
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm the only one here that follows Eurogamer.

01:50:11.993 --> 01:50:13.493
[SPEAKER_07]: I read a review of theirs today.

01:50:13.553 --> 01:50:16.774
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't understand why it didn't jive up with what the rest of the internet was saying, but...

01:50:17.108 --> 01:50:17.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

01:50:17.849 --> 01:50:18.189
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

01:50:39.474 --> 01:50:42.097
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Ouya is making progress.

01:50:42.217 --> 01:50:48.262
[SPEAKER_06]: They announced that they're going to be able to start shipping consoles December 28th.

01:50:48.583 --> 01:50:59.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it's not necessarily consoles to users, but those are development kits that are going to be going out for any developers that want to start making games for it.

01:50:59.253 --> 01:51:00.494
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, you know, if you have

01:51:01.314 --> 01:51:07.397
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget how much money you have to donate or contribute for Kickstarter in order to get one of those.

01:51:08.498 --> 01:51:09.538
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a few hundred dollars.

01:51:09.679 --> 01:51:12.020
[SPEAKER_06]: But those people are going to be getting their consoles soon.

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:15.842
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sounds like everything is going as planned.

01:51:15.942 --> 01:51:17.823
[SPEAKER_06]: And man, that thing is tiny.

01:51:18.823 --> 01:51:19.704
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:51:43.036 --> 01:51:43.977
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff later on.

01:51:44.277 --> 01:51:51.044
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I want to say that every console is going to be coming with a dev kit or like some sort of way where you can make your own.

01:51:51.064 --> 01:51:56.269
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're so open, I don't see why they wouldn't all function as dev kits in a way.

01:51:56.429 --> 01:51:56.989
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they will.

01:51:57.070 --> 01:51:58.891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just these consoles are a little bit earlier.

01:51:59.372 --> 01:52:01.694
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's going to be interesting.

01:52:02.154 --> 01:52:03.195
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really happening.

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:04.076
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really happening.

01:52:05.097 --> 01:52:05.577
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:37.023
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised if it's delayed past March because a lot of the Kickstarters that I've been contributing to, not a lot of them have been on time.

01:52:37.143 --> 01:52:47.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, hell, the stuff I got from Freddie Wong and the whole VJHS stuff arrived just a couple weeks ago versus the targeted date was, like, March.

01:52:48.167 --> 01:52:49.967
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so that's a long delay.

01:52:50.107 --> 01:52:54.389
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, I have a little trust that they're going to actually deliver on stuff.

01:52:55.009 --> 01:52:57.850
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, not exactly in the timetable that they were talking about.

01:53:01.146 --> 01:53:03.310
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf in our chat says, I'll believe it when I see it.

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.752
[SPEAKER_07]: It still has a chance to fail.

01:53:04.812 --> 01:53:06.394
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mayans predicted its failure.

01:53:07.476 --> 01:53:07.937
[SPEAKER_07]: True point.

01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:15.122
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the Kickstarters I've backed, I've only backed two, but GamerCon, I mean, that has to happen on the weekend.

01:53:15.142 --> 01:53:15.943
[SPEAKER_07]: They say it's going to happen.

01:53:15.963 --> 01:53:20.485
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they booked the venue, and it's moving forward, so I don't see how that's not going to happen when they say it does.

01:53:20.525 --> 01:53:21.305
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be exciting.

01:53:21.685 --> 01:53:26.667
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Shadowgate reboot was the other thing I Kickstarted, so I'm excited to see what comes of that.

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:29.048
[SPEAKER_07]: They send updates all the time.

01:53:29.088 --> 01:53:30.028
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to stop reading them.

01:53:30.048 --> 01:53:31.569
[SPEAKER_07]: They send too many damn updates.

01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:33.030
[SPEAKER_07]: They were up to, like, update 29.

01:53:34.691 --> 01:53:35.672
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more than that.

01:53:35.692 --> 01:53:36.494
[SPEAKER_06]: The Shadowgate one.

01:53:36.514 --> 01:53:37.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you back that too?

01:53:38.697 --> 01:53:39.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.

01:53:39.398 --> 01:53:41.020
[SPEAKER_06]: I backed the first one.

01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:48.431
[SPEAKER_06]: It was... I don't even remember what updates they have now, but I get updates from a lot of these.

01:53:48.771 --> 01:53:49.472
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got like...

01:53:50.774 --> 01:53:51.314
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:54:07.402 --> 01:54:35.372
[SPEAKER_07]: I like there's one I did I draw comics sketchbook and reference guide because it looked awesome there you go moving on to another news and rumor type of thing Yoshi's Land rumored for the Wii U and now Best Buy and Future Shop are apparently taking pre-orders for it this is after the whole Miiverse hack that's not really a hack but everybody called it that where the guy found the page the mock-up that Nintendo pulled and put the statement out on and

01:54:36.173 --> 01:54:41.578
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, Best Buy even has a little description of the game for Yoshi's Land.

01:54:41.638 --> 01:54:49.126
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, Take Yoshi on an epic adventure to remember in Yoshi Land for Nintendo Wii U. Check out Yoshi as you've never seen him before in glorious high definition.

01:54:49.467 --> 01:54:55.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy dual screen control thanks to the Wii U touchscreen gamepad where you'll also be able to experience full integration with Nintendo's Miiverse service.

01:54:56.394 --> 01:54:56.594
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

01:54:57.555 --> 01:55:03.301
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a whole lot of nothing because anybody could guess that on the title alone, but it's interesting that that exists.

01:55:05.242 --> 01:55:07.725
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you some tinfoil hatness here if you want.

01:55:08.986 --> 01:55:15.532
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe Reggie has teased a couple times that maybe we don't really know everything that's going to be in the launch window.

01:55:15.912 --> 01:55:17.254
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's something else.

01:55:18.115 --> 01:55:19.396
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be that something else.

01:55:20.095 --> 01:55:31.343
[SPEAKER_07]: And, speaking of Twitter and promoted posts, one of the posts that fell on my feed earlier this evening was from Spike TV saying, Hey gamers, don't forget to watch the Spike Video Game Awards.

01:55:31.804 --> 01:55:35.286
[SPEAKER_07]: More first party exclusive reveals or whatever.

01:55:35.326 --> 01:55:37.388
[SPEAKER_07]: More big game reveals.

01:55:39.062 --> 01:55:52.169
[SPEAKER_07]: we saw Miyamoto come out on stage at the last Spike TV Awards to great reception maybe maybe tinfoil hat Yoshi's Land to be revealed at Spike Gamer Awards discuss

01:55:53.405 --> 01:55:56.567
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a bunch of bullshit.

01:55:56.667 --> 01:55:57.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be honest here.

01:55:57.587 --> 01:55:58.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course you do!

01:55:59.088 --> 01:55:59.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be honest.

01:56:00.029 --> 01:56:11.435
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop was taking pre-orders for Pilotwings for the Wii and Mario Paint.

01:56:12.256 --> 01:56:14.597
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they had Mario Paint for the Wii U and stuff.

01:56:14.857 --> 01:56:22.142
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole bunch of TBA stuff that someone gets an idea that there might be something coming out and then they'll put a pre-order for it because guess what?

01:56:22.842 --> 01:56:25.368
[SPEAKER_06]: That's giving them your money.

01:56:26.817 --> 01:56:29.419
[SPEAKER_06]: They're taking a pre-order for a game, and if it doesn't come out, hey, guess what?

01:56:29.699 --> 01:56:34.542
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got this credit that you paid for this game, and now you can apply this to another game.

01:56:34.742 --> 01:56:43.487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why companies love gift cards, because there's so many people that never spend them or just have remaining balances on them that they throw the card away.

01:56:43.928 --> 01:56:45.469
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's just a 50-cent balance.

01:56:45.489 --> 01:56:46.249
[SPEAKER_07]: Just throw it away.

01:56:46.730 --> 01:56:48.531
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the company just made 50 cents off you.

01:56:49.231 --> 01:56:49.511
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:56:49.631 --> 01:56:53.254
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that happens a thousand times, it starts to become a little bit of money.

01:56:55.697 --> 01:57:02.614
[SPEAKER_07]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase Jellyfish.

01:57:04.339 --> 01:57:10.344
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw has a thought that maybe the Spike VGAs will reveal Bungie's new game, which recently had leaked concept art.

01:57:10.624 --> 01:57:12.025
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another great thought, actually.

01:57:12.286 --> 01:57:17.290
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already said which games are getting reveals, or at least some of them.

01:57:19.011 --> 01:57:24.235
[SPEAKER_06]: Like The Last of Us, and I don't think it's necessarily a reveal, but like a new gameplay thing.

01:57:25.136 --> 01:57:28.439
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to remember what else was on there.

01:57:28.459 --> 01:57:29.880
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe Fuse?

01:57:31.261 --> 01:57:31.561
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:57:34.266 --> 01:57:37.650
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched the little trailer that they had with Samuel L. Jackson as a baby.

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:39.231
[SPEAKER_06]: That was weird.

01:57:40.052 --> 01:57:41.213
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't watch any of it.

01:57:42.174 --> 01:57:46.799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to wait until five minutes after the show's over and then everything shows up on YouTube.

01:57:46.999 --> 01:57:47.520
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I need.

01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:49.622
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want the YouTubes of the reveals.

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:52.084
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like the year that Skyrim was announced.

01:57:52.104 --> 01:57:52.685
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube.

01:57:52.705 --> 01:57:53.005
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube.

01:57:54.983 --> 01:57:57.104
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think maybe a new Batman game will be announced?

01:57:57.324 --> 01:57:58.785
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I hope not.

01:57:59.025 --> 01:58:00.105
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

01:58:00.165 --> 01:58:00.906
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite your tongue.

01:58:01.046 --> 01:58:02.647
[SPEAKER_07]: Arkham City was amazing.

01:58:03.787 --> 01:58:04.988
[SPEAKER_07]: You know where you can put that thumb.

01:58:05.388 --> 01:58:07.249
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

01:58:07.769 --> 01:58:08.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki gave me a thumbs down.

01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:12.171
[SPEAKER_07]: You really hate Arkham City?

01:58:12.191 --> 01:58:13.171
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't hate it.

01:58:13.211 --> 01:58:13.772
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never played it.

01:58:14.072 --> 01:58:14.692
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know shit!

01:58:14.752 --> 01:58:17.593
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to see another Batman game.

01:58:17.814 --> 01:58:18.634
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's stupid.

01:58:19.611 --> 01:58:20.191
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

01:58:20.372 --> 01:58:21.492
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this conversation.

01:58:21.572 --> 01:58:22.433
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't talk to you.

01:58:22.613 --> 01:58:25.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you have another Batman game when they just released one last year?

01:58:26.495 --> 01:58:27.135
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

01:58:27.155 --> 01:58:29.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Batman Arkham State!

01:58:29.697 --> 01:58:31.638
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the whole state is a prison now!

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:33.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Arkham?

01:58:33.459 --> 01:58:39.903
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they had joked they were going to call it Arkham World, but that didn't actually mean... Hey, hey, I have an idea.

01:58:39.943 --> 01:58:40.283
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's...

01:58:40.603 --> 01:59:00.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get Snake Plistin in here, he'll fucking escape from New York Oh wait, but it's gonna be Batman instead But hey, whatever, we'll just rip it off, it'll be fun It doesn't actually mean world, dummy We're gonna see how many more Batman villains we can shove in here Hey, is there any other obscure Batman villains that we haven't tackled yet?

01:59:00.158 --> 01:59:06.963
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe we can just get Lex Luthor in there because we're running out of Batman villains Your opinion does not even count, you haven't even played the game

01:59:08.499 --> 01:59:09.379
[SPEAKER_07]: You lose!

01:59:09.399 --> 01:59:10.380
[SPEAKER_07]: Good day, sir!

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:11.300
[SPEAKER_04]: I am totally enjoying this.

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.381
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just sitting back going, mm-hmm.

01:59:13.561 --> 01:59:14.401
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an idiot!

01:59:14.561 --> 01:59:14.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him!

01:59:17.262 --> 01:59:18.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob thinks you're an idiot.

01:59:19.763 --> 01:59:20.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

01:59:21.124 --> 01:59:22.304
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care what Rob thinks.

01:59:25.505 --> 01:59:26.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we care what you think.

01:59:28.226 --> 01:59:32.628
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

01:59:32.748 --> 01:59:34.148
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you want to call Loki an idiot.

01:59:34.449 --> 01:59:35.549
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

01:59:35.649 --> 01:59:37.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm such an idiot because I actually don't have the mailbag pulled up.

01:59:39.315 --> 01:59:40.996
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you're an idiot too!

01:59:41.136 --> 01:59:42.917
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surrounded by idiots!

01:59:43.597 --> 01:59:45.498
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're surrounded by assholes, it's different.

01:59:45.518 --> 01:59:46.859
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go play Arkham City.

01:59:47.439 --> 01:59:48.860
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm pulling it up.

01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:57.084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I've been sort of doing some damage management of a severe nature.

01:59:57.464 --> 01:59:57.864
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:59:58.905 --> 02:00:00.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm pulling up the email now.

02:00:00.286 --> 02:00:00.666
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:00:01.586 --> 02:00:04.988
[SPEAKER_07]: I want gossip, girl, you gotta tell me about this after the email bag.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.081
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Arkham Asylum at E3.

02:00:11.101 --> 02:00:12.161
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what game I hate?

02:00:12.361 --> 02:00:13.301
[SPEAKER_07]: Earth Defense Force.

02:00:13.441 --> 02:00:13.961
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

02:00:14.242 --> 02:00:14.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Lord.

02:00:15.202 --> 02:00:16.102
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're just trolling.

02:00:16.162 --> 02:00:17.022
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for bros.

02:00:17.242 --> 02:00:18.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I've never played it.

02:00:18.303 --> 02:00:19.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're just trolling.

02:00:20.723 --> 02:00:21.683
[SPEAKER_04]: They see you trolling.

02:00:21.703 --> 02:00:22.224
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hating.

02:00:23.824 --> 02:00:25.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we only have one email.

02:00:27.665 --> 02:00:28.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR.

02:00:28.445 --> 02:00:29.685
[SPEAKER_04]: Another email from Belgium here.

02:00:29.865 --> 02:00:31.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Belgium!

02:00:32.958 --> 02:00:39.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Since Sony is doing so bad, I've been thinking lately, do you guys think Sony will have enough resources to launch a decent next-gen system?

02:00:40.206 --> 02:00:44.291
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs billions of dollars to develop and launch a new console and they don't have that kind of money.

02:00:44.911 --> 02:00:45.552
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they do.

02:00:46.133 --> 02:00:49.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, with their rating dropping, banks will be less eager to loan the money.

02:00:49.677 --> 02:00:54.242
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Nintendo made the Wii technologically inferior because of money problems, or is this wrong?

02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:56.280
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

02:00:56.841 --> 02:00:58.042
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a damn good point.

02:01:01.124 --> 02:01:01.744
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:01:03.065 --> 02:01:05.647
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation 4 could end up being a bunch of smoke and mirrors, too.

02:01:05.847 --> 02:01:15.013
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be that this whole tech with the controller changing or whatever may be the big thing, and it's not really that souped up of a system.

02:01:15.393 --> 02:01:18.215
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think the internet would crucify them if that happened.

02:01:18.455 --> 02:01:22.158
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see someone trying to separate their controller they have right now.

02:01:22.398 --> 02:01:26.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I broke my controller, I split it in two and it's not working like I saw in the picture.

02:01:26.661 --> 02:01:27.141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to.

02:01:27.221 --> 02:01:28.982
[SPEAKER_07]: I've said this before and I'll say it again.

02:01:29.283 --> 02:01:31.944
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think Sony has to launch a new console next year.

02:01:32.925 --> 02:01:36.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not sell more PlayStation 3s by putting out amazing games?

02:01:36.828 --> 02:01:44.953
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't... I realize a lot of people expect Sony to put out a console next year because of what Microsoft is doing, but... I don't even know if Microsoft's putting out a console next year.

02:01:45.774 --> 02:01:51.578
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all... Yeah, that's all... Remember, we're just listening to analysts that are speaking out of their ass.

02:01:51.678 --> 02:01:52.038
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

02:01:52.938 --> 02:01:55.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

02:02:13.873 --> 02:02:16.494
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, thanks a lot for making a new episode every week.

02:02:16.554 --> 02:02:16.934
[SPEAKER_04]: You rock.

02:02:17.034 --> 02:02:17.274
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

02:02:17.314 --> 02:02:19.455
[SPEAKER_04]: If we win the contest, I'll send you a box of Belgian chocolates.

02:02:19.815 --> 02:02:20.396
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, deal.

02:02:20.936 --> 02:02:22.456
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally, as long as they're dark chocolate.

02:02:22.696 --> 02:02:23.457
[SPEAKER_07]: Go vote now.

02:02:23.637 --> 02:02:25.077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to share this with the chat room.

02:02:25.197 --> 02:02:26.578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a playground.

02:02:26.618 --> 02:02:27.498
[SPEAKER_07]: It's volunteer.

02:02:27.738 --> 02:02:29.479
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for a good cause.

02:02:29.559 --> 02:02:30.999
[SPEAKER_04]: We totally support this.

02:02:31.319 --> 02:02:34.641
[SPEAKER_07]: We like games of all sorts, including the ones you play outdoors.

02:02:34.861 --> 02:02:35.781
[SPEAKER_07]: So good luck, buddy.

02:02:35.801 --> 02:02:36.321
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you win.

02:02:36.701 --> 02:02:37.922
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes to the chocolate.

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.180
[SPEAKER_07]: Peanut Butter

02:03:06.417 --> 02:03:06.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

02:03:07.077 --> 02:03:07.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:03:07.738 --> 02:03:08.738
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?

02:03:08.878 --> 02:03:09.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, they use Marmite.

02:03:10.419 --> 02:03:10.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

02:03:10.819 --> 02:03:11.079
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:03:11.679 --> 02:03:11.959
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird.

02:03:12.479 --> 02:03:12.979
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:20.202
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a candy exchange with Robert K. And he sent me... Oh, yeah.

02:03:20.562 --> 02:03:24.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, sadly, I was allergic to the candy that he sent me because I can't eat gummies.

02:03:24.584 --> 02:03:25.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't.

02:03:25.624 --> 02:03:26.264
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have eaten it.

02:03:27.205 --> 02:03:28.205
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought it, remember?

02:03:28.265 --> 02:03:29.045
[SPEAKER_04]: The Jelly Babies and stuff?

02:03:29.065 --> 02:03:29.606
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you did.

02:03:29.626 --> 02:03:29.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

02:03:30.526 --> 02:03:35.188
[SPEAKER_04]: But I sent a bunch of these Baskin Robbins candies.

02:03:35.988 --> 02:03:39.269
[SPEAKER_04]: that were these hard candies flavored like Baskin Robbins ice creams.

02:03:39.289 --> 02:03:39.810
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I remember those.

02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:40.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are good.

02:03:40.410 --> 02:03:41.530
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said he really liked them.

02:03:41.610 --> 02:03:42.931
[SPEAKER_04]: I also sent him cans of salsa.

02:03:44.651 --> 02:03:45.772
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that something you can't get over there?

02:03:45.972 --> 02:03:47.372
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you can get salsa.

02:03:47.452 --> 02:03:54.075
[SPEAKER_04]: This was actually like the, what's the Mexican grocery stores called?

02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:56.920
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.821
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is actually like authentic.

02:03:59.021 --> 02:04:01.262
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, down in LA, you see them everywhere.

02:04:01.302 --> 02:04:02.663
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the name of it.

02:04:02.703 --> 02:04:03.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Carson something.

02:04:03.364 --> 02:04:03.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

02:04:03.644 --> 02:04:04.444
[SPEAKER_04]: Carcinogen.

02:04:05.485 --> 02:04:05.905
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay.

02:04:06.125 --> 02:04:15.191
[SPEAKER_07]: What's funny is that Syl linked me to a website that, you know, I would never look this shit up, but it's a store in the UK that sells American imported goods.

02:04:15.271 --> 02:04:19.193
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just hilarious looking at the stuff they were advertising on the site, like Captain Crunch.

02:04:19.253 --> 02:04:22.595
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh, I take that shit for granted that you can just get Captain Crunch at the grocery store here.

02:04:23.175 --> 02:04:29.678
[SPEAKER_07]: And even speaking of like Mexico, you could get, because how easy is it to get Yarritos, the soda, right?

02:04:29.718 --> 02:04:30.219
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

02:04:30.619 --> 02:04:32.200
[SPEAKER_04]: I never saw one until I moved out here.

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:37.042
[SPEAKER_07]: But especially like even at Target and stuff, you can get like the quote unquote Mexican Coke.

02:04:37.382 --> 02:04:38.143
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very easy to get.

02:04:38.163 --> 02:04:39.203
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a whole little wall.

02:04:39.243 --> 02:04:43.065
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what, you see it a lot during Passover because it's not made with corn syrup.

02:04:43.225 --> 02:04:43.746
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, very true.

02:04:44.166 --> 02:04:46.627
[SPEAKER_04]: And corn is considered not kosher for Passover.

02:04:46.807 --> 02:04:48.108
[SPEAKER_07]: But you see it all the time at Target.

02:04:48.148 --> 02:04:50.189
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Target has their... Or throwback.

02:04:51.808 --> 02:04:53.369
[SPEAKER_07]: Jones Soda, I guess, is a thing, too.

02:04:53.409 --> 02:04:54.569
[SPEAKER_07]: Jones is so good.

02:04:55.169 --> 02:04:56.630
[SPEAKER_07]: It's even kind of hard to find here.

02:04:56.770 --> 02:04:59.810
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish we could get one of the Thanksgiving boxes and send it over.

02:05:00.191 --> 02:05:05.632
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, the gravy one is weird, but I hear that the cranberry sauce soda is actually really delicious.

02:05:05.692 --> 02:05:06.452
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, though.

02:05:06.512 --> 02:05:13.814
[SPEAKER_07]: Syl says she can't have it until February because she's on a lifestyle adjustment until February, so she can't get the candy until then.

02:05:13.854 --> 02:05:15.855
[SPEAKER_07]: But little does she know.

02:05:16.775 --> 02:05:17.335
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:05:44.071 --> 02:05:58.989
[SPEAKER_07]: mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to email us in a future episode meanwhile it's time for a segment we do every week here on the show often imitated never duplicated haha it's the FUs of the week

02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:26.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, F you to, uh, Misunderstandings, um, and, yeah, I'm doing, um, some damage control, it's not a big thing, well, really, um, it's just...

02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:40.438
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um, and, uh, also, uh, FUs to, uh, the, what, three inches of water in my backseat on the passenger side.

02:06:41.318 --> 02:06:45.841
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's a seal broken somewhere in my car, and yeah, that almost cost me my laptop once.

02:06:46.502 --> 02:06:48.343
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that sucks.

02:06:51.505 --> 02:06:55.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I guess FU to... I don't know.

02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.389
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:06:59.518 --> 02:07:05.682
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf wanted us to clarify that what you're talking about has nothing to do with VOG.

02:07:14.068 --> 02:07:15.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing to do with VOG.

02:07:15.609 --> 02:07:17.130
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's happy-go-lucky at VOG.

02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:18.872
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I know.

02:07:20.473 --> 02:07:25.417
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, my FU of the week goes to sleeping so much.

02:07:25.637 --> 02:07:29.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, you guys, it is disgusting how much I've slept over this weekend, but I feel great.

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:31.501
[SPEAKER_07]: An FU to the weather.

02:07:31.641 --> 02:07:33.883
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been non-stop shitty for the past three days.

02:07:34.003 --> 02:07:35.004
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thankful it's finally 30.

02:07:35.044 --> 02:07:35.844
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me happy.

02:07:35.864 --> 02:07:36.085
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

02:07:36.305 --> 02:07:37.546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like for a couple days though.

02:07:40.848 --> 02:07:42.890
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:08:06.318 --> 02:08:06.718
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:08:07.478 --> 02:08:11.499
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with a couple more news stories, and then we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:08:11.679 --> 02:08:12.719
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:08:13.139 --> 02:08:17.640
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a new Kickstarter for this LA game space.

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:24.522
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's kind of unique about it, they're going to be creating some new games to kind of, I guess, go along with this.

02:08:25.382 --> 02:08:33.924
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the games that they're getting created are actually by some pretty famous people, including they've got the creator of Katamari Damacy.

02:08:36.084 --> 02:08:38.425
[SPEAKER_06]: Kata Takahashi Adam Saltzman

02:08:57.552 --> 02:09:01.495
[SPEAKER_06]: There are going to be 30 new games from different indie developers.

02:09:01.535 --> 02:09:11.661
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pretty prominent, including stuff by... The guy that did Hotline Miami, Steve Swink of Scale.

02:09:12.421 --> 02:09:15.683
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I guess, the guy that did Unfinished Swan.

02:09:16.423 --> 02:09:23.328
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to get Pendleton Ward also, who did... I guess he's doing a game with...

02:09:25.305 --> 02:09:33.908
[SPEAKER_06]: and Bennett Foddy who did QWOP and CLOP which I really need to go back and play because... Oh, God.

02:09:34.588 --> 02:09:35.469
[SPEAKER_06]: CLOP was awesome.

02:09:37.209 --> 02:09:40.391
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, they're going to be... It's pretty awesome.

02:09:40.431 --> 02:09:43.232
[SPEAKER_06]: If you pledge $15 or more, you get those 30 games.

02:09:43.952 --> 02:09:44.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

02:09:44.332 --> 02:09:44.912
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

02:09:44.972 --> 02:09:50.934
[SPEAKER_06]: And $5 or more and you get that one game that's being done by the two first guys I mentioned.

02:09:51.375 --> 02:09:51.595
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

02:09:52.695 --> 02:09:53.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely check it out.

02:09:53.576 --> 02:09:55.657
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably going to hit their goal because they're looking for $250,000.

02:09:55.697 --> 02:09:59.199
[SPEAKER_06]: They have four days left to go and they're at $234,000.

02:10:00.719 --> 02:10:01.480
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they'll be okay.

02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:02.820
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll be alright.

02:10:03.021 --> 02:10:06.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, there was another one I did see that they were looking for $50,000 and they missed it by $28.

02:10:06.622 --> 02:10:10.664
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't make it, you get none of it.

02:10:10.805 --> 02:10:11.365
[SPEAKER_06]: You get none of it.

02:10:11.985 --> 02:10:12.485
[SPEAKER_07]: You can try again.

02:10:12.505 --> 02:10:13.506
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

02:10:14.798 --> 02:10:23.642
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, lastly tonight, before we go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR and the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR, this is a bit of a visual.

02:10:23.702 --> 02:10:25.683
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, guys, but you can Google this.

02:10:26.423 --> 02:10:33.666
[SPEAKER_07]: The cover of the final Nintendo Power has been released, and it is awesomely nostalgic.

02:10:33.707 --> 02:10:35.587
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a perfect send-off to the magazine.

02:10:36.028 --> 02:10:37.568
[SPEAKER_07]: It ends the way it began.

02:10:37.968 --> 02:10:41.270
[SPEAKER_07]: The final cover looks a lot like the first cover.

02:10:42.731 --> 02:10:50.594
[SPEAKER_07]: The very first cover of Nintendo Power was Super Mario 2, and so you have Wart in the background, and you have the vegetables, because that was a big part of Mario 2.

02:10:51.414 --> 02:10:55.296
[SPEAKER_07]: The final cover of Nintendo Power is for New Super Mario Bros.

02:10:55.536 --> 02:11:02.419
[SPEAKER_07]: U, with Bowser in the background and Goombas, but still just the very similar look.

02:11:02.679 --> 02:11:05.841
[SPEAKER_07]: You clearly get the reference here if you've been a fan of Nintendo Power.

02:11:06.441 --> 02:11:14.747
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, it's very interesting when you put the two covers side by side, you really notice that on that first cover of Nintendo Power, Mario's color palette was wrong.

02:11:14.807 --> 02:11:15.588
[SPEAKER_07]: It was reversed.

02:11:16.148 --> 02:11:20.551
[SPEAKER_07]: He has the blue overalls, or excuse me, the blue overalls is right and the red shirt, but his hat, his hat's wrong.

02:11:21.172 --> 02:11:23.414
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of interesting that that's all screwed up.

02:11:23.474 --> 02:11:25.855
[SPEAKER_07]: But regardless, a great send off.

02:11:26.316 --> 02:11:30.579
[SPEAKER_07]: And even like the same colors as a designer, Dark Sakura doesn't make you happy.

02:11:31.573 --> 02:11:32.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for the most part.

02:11:32.433 --> 02:11:34.734
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's actually a lot better laid out.

02:11:36.235 --> 02:11:37.515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more dynamic, I'll say that.

02:11:37.615 --> 02:11:45.417
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, the Nintendo Power logo, the new one, also lends itself to a bit more dynamic because of the differences in size.

02:11:45.978 --> 02:11:50.079
[SPEAKER_07]: I also just like, even the little POW is the same, the little POW poster inside.

02:11:50.139 --> 02:11:51.199
[SPEAKER_07]: Poster inside is like the same.

02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:52.080
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:52.800
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

02:11:53.700 --> 02:12:11.605
[SPEAKER_07]: uh it makes me sad to see Nintendo Power Go but then again if I was going to be that sad I wouldn't have stopped reading it about like 15 years ago sorry not to be Debbie Downer but that's the reason why the magazines are going out of business so hopefully there'll be something else in the future maybe a newsstand app on the iPhone or something I don't know but we'll see

02:12:12.485 --> 02:12:16.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's go to the phones.

02:12:16.047 --> 02:12:19.968
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:20.729 --> 02:12:30.053
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Actdeft catches this in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com pointing out the last issue has Mario going to the pole, meaning the end.

02:12:30.873 --> 02:12:31.793
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even catch that.

02:12:32.173 --> 02:12:33.794
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like the halfway point flagged me.

02:12:34.174 --> 02:12:36.595
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to the pole because that's where he's going to work from now on.

02:12:37.836 --> 02:12:38.316
[SPEAKER_06]: On the pole.

02:12:40.476 --> 02:12:41.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario's not going to the poll.

02:12:41.656 --> 02:12:42.857
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a whole new era.

02:12:43.137 --> 02:12:44.297
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario's not going to the poll.

02:12:44.337 --> 02:12:45.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Those games still sell like crazy.

02:12:46.438 --> 02:12:49.979
[SPEAKER_07]: I guarantee besides Nintendo Land, it's the top selling Wii U game right now.

02:12:50.039 --> 02:12:57.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but what's the way you're going to expand your demographic into the stripper market than getting, you know, strippers in your games?

02:12:58.221 --> 02:13:01.962
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because that's exactly what they need to get at Nintendo is strippers.

02:13:02.622 --> 02:13:04.103
[SPEAKER_04]: I think... I need strippers now.

02:13:04.163 --> 02:13:04.883
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they should.

02:13:06.673 --> 02:13:07.014
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:13:07.474 --> 02:13:13.021
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the phone's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:13.061 --> 02:13:17.247
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I get to the Twitters, Loki, do you have any last minute comments?

02:13:17.267 --> 02:13:20.150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they have got some cool plug-ins for Gary's mod.

02:13:20.351 --> 02:13:21.492
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out December 6th.

02:13:22.653 --> 02:13:25.374
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's basically a Kinect PC plugin.

02:13:25.494 --> 02:13:29.776
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to do body capture using the Kinect.

02:13:30.036 --> 02:13:37.959
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to need Kinect for Windows Runtime version 1.6 but you're going to be able to do all sorts of funny stuff with Gary's mod with that.

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:41.501
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

02:13:41.521 --> 02:13:42.301
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a call coming in.

02:13:42.341 --> 02:13:43.241
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:43.261 --> 02:13:43.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

02:13:43.621 --> 02:13:45.482
[SPEAKER_00]: We see you tonight.

02:13:47.884 --> 02:13:49.624
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because I have a webcam now.

02:13:49.684 --> 02:13:50.505
[SPEAKER_07]: You sure do.

02:13:50.725 --> 02:13:51.705
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:13:51.965 --> 02:13:53.185
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I need to get a webcam.

02:13:54.305 --> 02:13:55.226
[SPEAKER_00]: I still need one.

02:13:56.206 --> 02:13:58.206
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you answered the Google question of the week.

02:13:58.766 --> 02:14:02.387
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it on my Facebook news feed earlier today.

02:14:02.407 --> 02:14:12.129
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get a chance to answer it, but there is one thing I am looking forward this holiday season is the supposed PS3 that my girlfriend is hinting at.

02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:16.030
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am, in other words, a new system is probably on my way.

02:14:16.838 --> 02:14:17.718
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucky you!

02:14:18.959 --> 02:14:26.943
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it makes up for the fact that I got her a car stereo and the other Hanukkah present that will be forthcoming.

02:14:27.603 --> 02:14:30.445
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know, she might be a listener of this program.

02:14:30.605 --> 02:14:31.525
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to give it all away.

02:14:32.926 --> 02:14:35.187
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, she doesn't listen to this.

02:14:35.387 --> 02:14:45.832
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, video games is only a small fraction of her life, aside from taking care of wildlife and watching anime and British dramas.

02:14:47.282 --> 02:14:55.587
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, now that I'm going to presume that I'm definitely getting a PS3 this holiday season, I'm just trying to see where to begin from there.

02:14:56.448 --> 02:15:01.070
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is like the first time I'm getting a new system since I got my 360.

02:15:01.511 --> 02:15:08.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was just about to ask you, if let's say you're right on your hunch and you do end up getting a PlayStation 3, what do you think you're going to get?

02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:21.410
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to get the games that I were hinting at, stuff like Gran Turismo 5, Metal Gear Solid 4, the Uncharted series, so pretty much all the PS3 exclusives.

02:15:23.403 --> 02:15:27.786
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way I'm going to get any other multi-platform game than I would otherwise get on PC.

02:15:28.707 --> 02:15:47.564
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this goes to the argument that if you compare both Microsoft and Sony in terms of games that are more first party, it looks like if you compare them side by side, aside from Halo and Forza and Fable,

02:15:48.462 --> 02:15:54.884
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a bit more first party titles on Sony's side than you would in Microsoft.

02:15:55.325 --> 02:15:57.325
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in between is just multi-platform.

02:15:58.026 --> 02:16:04.208
[SPEAKER_07]: Since it came up earlier, we were talking a lot about how Sony has a lot of great download stuff on PSN that people are overlooking.

02:16:04.248 --> 02:16:09.510
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any interest in Journey or the Swan game or Unfinished Swan or any of that stuff?

02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:13.812
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to it.

02:16:13.872 --> 02:16:16.813
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to Home in particular.

02:16:17.898 --> 02:16:19.700
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing what that thing's about.

02:16:20.021 --> 02:16:25.188
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, I guess after I get the PS3, then I have to figure out which high def TV I'm looking for.

02:16:26.269 --> 02:16:33.278
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm putting it off, to be honest, trying to find something that's really fast, that's under one frame of lag.

02:16:34.346 --> 02:16:39.432
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, for my rhythm and dancing games, I need something really fast.

02:16:39.912 --> 02:16:49.723
[SPEAKER_00]: And in case of fighting games, so it's like I'm really holding off until I find something, something that's tried and true that others have used with certainty that I can easily buy

02:16:50.484 --> 02:16:52.205
[SPEAKER_00]: in my local Best Buy that same day.

02:17:10.513 --> 02:17:17.154
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but that's contrary to what I'm hearing in the Shoryuken forums on, you know, the big fighting game community site.

02:17:18.315 --> 02:17:27.736
[SPEAKER_00]: In their tech talk section, they do have, you know, they have like threads for sub, you know, for sub one frame high-def TVs.

02:17:27.816 --> 02:17:32.717
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are just like, they're either available or they're just like discontinued.

02:17:32.817 --> 02:17:36.458
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, it's monitors that are damn near lagless.

02:17:36.478 --> 02:17:36.698
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

02:17:36.718 --> 02:17:56.361
[SPEAKER_07]: You have some comments in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com ShiningForce3inator Hey, that name's gonna get you arrested Says, I put up a thread on the VOG boards with some PS3, PSN recommendations And Brad from PodCulture suggesting a Vizio Go Vizio, it is the best bang for your buck Not at Best Buy, Wally World, or Costco

02:17:57.233 --> 02:18:00.334
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to Walmart, but... I got mine at Costco.

02:18:00.454 --> 02:18:01.895
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had a great experience at Costco.

02:18:01.915 --> 02:18:02.355
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't complain.

02:18:02.395 --> 02:18:07.758
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need something that I can play 2DX on and occasionally fight games.

02:18:08.018 --> 02:18:08.418
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

02:18:08.698 --> 02:18:12.900
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fast, that I don't have to offset for timing.

02:18:14.423 --> 02:18:17.087
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I would pick up a high FTB amount on my wall.

02:18:17.167 --> 02:18:25.778
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe someday Konami will put out, now that they've gone HD with 2DX, they'll actually put out all they've missed on like one Uber PlayStation 3 game.

02:18:25.798 --> 02:18:26.599
[SPEAKER_07]: At least we can do that.

02:18:26.619 --> 02:18:26.820
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:27.440
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

02:18:27.921 --> 02:18:28.282
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

02:18:28.422 --> 02:18:28.983
[SPEAKER_00]: And then

02:18:29.343 --> 02:18:33.044
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the day when, like, pigs fly from the skyline.

02:18:33.124 --> 02:18:33.804
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

02:18:34.144 --> 02:18:36.205
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the day when Rock Revolution 2 is announced.

02:18:36.485 --> 02:18:41.286
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but thanks for the call, and I hope you do get the PS3.

02:18:41.326 --> 02:18:41.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

02:18:42.386 --> 02:18:42.707
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

02:18:42.867 --> 02:18:43.467
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, take care, buddy.

02:18:44.347 --> 02:18:44.747
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

02:18:45.887 --> 02:18:47.028
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the video.

02:18:48.939 --> 02:18:51.681
[SPEAKER_07]: I want more people to call in with video even though it's a radio show.

02:18:51.721 --> 02:18:52.641
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I'm amused.

02:18:52.921 --> 02:18:56.324
[SPEAKER_07]: But please, for the love of God, make sure you're decent if you're going to call in on video.

02:18:56.844 --> 02:18:57.684
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki.

02:18:58.785 --> 02:18:59.766
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other stories?

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:07.691
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft Vancouver is now Black Tusk Studios and apparently they're working on the next big franchise for the Xbox.

02:19:08.711 --> 02:19:11.033
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, like something for the new Xbox maybe?

02:19:11.053 --> 02:19:13.194
[SPEAKER_06]: Just whatever the next big AAA franchise is going to be.

02:19:15.175 --> 02:19:16.176
[SPEAKER_07]: What could it be?

02:19:18.218 --> 02:19:25.668
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to the Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR Spazinator wants to know What are the odds of a Gangnam Style parody with a Mass Effect theme?

02:19:26.049 --> 02:19:26.890
[SPEAKER_07]: Garrus style anyone?

02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:28.232
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean that hasn't already been done?

02:19:28.392 --> 02:19:31.677
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been done Check out, there's this thing called Tumblr

02:19:33.305 --> 02:19:38.647
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, it's definitely possible now that they have, was it the JibJab app or whatever, you can upload pictures of people.

02:19:40.188 --> 02:19:41.249
[SPEAKER_07]: So, true story.

02:19:41.889 --> 02:19:51.173
[SPEAKER_07]: The other day, I was looking up YouTube videos, and I just, I found myself on Psy, and I was like, I wonder if his other music's any good, and I was looking at one of his other songs, and I was like, alright, this is kind of cool.

02:19:51.193 --> 02:19:52.013
[SPEAKER_04]: Passionate Goodbye is really good.

02:19:52.334 --> 02:19:59.597
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, if you look on the right side at all the related videos, it was all of these Psy videos, like Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy.

02:19:59.877 --> 02:20:01.798
[SPEAKER_07]: But then there was this one video towards the top, and

02:20:02.558 --> 02:20:05.640
[SPEAKER_07]: Hippopotamus takes a massive dump at the zoo.

02:20:07.461 --> 02:20:08.942
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess which one I clicked.

02:20:11.664 --> 02:20:14.306
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, this is more interesting than the side video.

02:20:19.309 --> 02:20:19.649
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:20:21.430 --> 02:20:23.652
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that Glee did Gangnam Style?

02:20:24.092 --> 02:20:24.652
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

02:20:24.672 --> 02:20:25.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they actually speak Korean?

02:20:26.488 --> 02:20:26.928
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:20:27.329 --> 02:20:27.909
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's terrible.

02:20:27.929 --> 02:20:28.690
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Rob?

02:20:28.750 --> 02:20:37.678
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was discovering Adventure Time last night, after five seasons of not ever watching any of it, I found that someone did an Adventure Time Gangnam Style.

02:20:38.519 --> 02:20:38.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Good lord.

02:20:39.119 --> 02:20:44.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, the one you should look up is the Gangnam Style crossed with Too Legit to Quit with NC Hammer.

02:20:44.484 --> 02:20:44.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:20:54.351 --> 02:20:55.512
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm offended just hearing that.

02:20:55.532 --> 02:20:56.813
[SPEAKER_06]: That just sounds wrong.

02:20:59.676 --> 02:21:00.536
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the phones.

02:21:00.777 --> 02:21:01.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:21:01.898 --> 02:21:02.278
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

02:21:03.899 --> 02:21:05.260
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Haseo Sumuragawa.

02:21:05.521 --> 02:21:07.202
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how are you doing?

02:21:08.963 --> 02:21:09.844
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty well.

02:21:10.204 --> 02:21:11.946
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, Haseo Sumuragawa?

02:21:13.667 --> 02:21:21.714
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was, uh, you know, putting my, uh, my bid for, uh, the trophy, uh,

02:21:22.210 --> 02:21:33.976
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, you're putting in your bid for being a trophy whore among the listeners?

02:21:36.238 --> 02:21:51.826
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supremely cheap to, and if you haven't played them yet, to pick up the God of War saga, because then it's three main games on disc, and you get a download voucher for the PSP collection.

02:21:52.999 --> 02:21:59.043
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, and I bet you can find that pretty cheap these days, because that God of War collection came out like a couple years ago.

02:21:59.103 --> 02:22:00.024
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have it, too.

02:22:04.006 --> 02:22:18.997
[SPEAKER_02]: They recently re-released it as the God of War song, because it originally was the God of War HD collection, which was 1 and 2, and then that came out right in time for 3, or around 3, and then they came out for 8.

02:22:21.234 --> 02:22:24.996
[SPEAKER_02]: HD Collection, which was Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta.

02:22:25.016 --> 02:22:28.337
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the God of War saga, you get all five games.

02:22:29.777 --> 02:22:31.738
[SPEAKER_07]: So you say you're the resident trophy whore.

02:22:31.778 --> 02:22:33.359
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your PlayStation level?

02:22:35.619 --> 02:22:33.359
14.

02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:36.900
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty good.

02:22:37.140 --> 02:22:38.580
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm only at like 7 or 8.

02:22:38.841 --> 02:22:44.623
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't, I mean, you know, do you play other consoles or like just, are you like only Sony in your house?

02:22:47.043 --> 02:22:48.304
[SPEAKER_02]: Only Sony, but you know, I'm

02:22:48.803 --> 02:23:07.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about maybe picking up a 360 to check out the games I miss on 360, such as Halo and Gears of War, because I hear good things.

02:23:08.764 --> 02:23:15.566
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we've been talking a little bit tonight about how a lot of people have been overlooking some of the good stuff that Sony's doing.

02:23:15.606 --> 02:23:22.208
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it doesn't seem like a lot of people tend to care about Move, and there's so much good stuff on PlayStation Network that tends to go overlooked.

02:23:22.748 --> 02:23:28.470
[SPEAKER_07]: As somebody who's a bit of a Sony fan, what do you think people are missing by not giving Sony more credit?

02:23:30.771 --> 02:23:38.213
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, first of all, they actually, um, the first variety of games, such as God of War, Infamous, and, uh,

02:23:39.792 --> 02:24:08.168
[SPEAKER_02]: the entire series are all really great series and I mean even like the download games like Journey as you mentioned earlier and Flow and Flower they're really great games and not to mention the PS3 has been getting a whole lot of the collections compared to the 360's

02:24:10.976 --> 02:24:11.276
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotcha.

02:24:11.296 --> 02:24:12.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's true.

02:24:12.237 --> 02:24:15.800
[SPEAKER_07]: They put a lot of that good stuff, like all those collections out on disc.

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:18.102
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes a good point, like a good starting point.

02:24:18.462 --> 02:24:24.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the Journey collection, you know, has Flower and Flow and all that would be a great starting point for somebody.

02:24:25.508 --> 02:24:25.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:24:27.029 --> 02:24:35.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, with that, I mean, it's... If I remember correctly, because my friend bought it, it was...

02:24:37.032 --> 02:24:45.039
[SPEAKER_02]: $30 plus you got a free month of PlayStation Plus and a whole bunch of player IDs and I think even a theme.

02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:46.140
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

02:24:47.181 --> 02:24:47.722
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

02:24:48.362 --> 02:24:51.205
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, before we let you go, is there anything else you want to share with us tonight?

02:24:55.549 --> 02:24:57.150
[SPEAKER_02]: Other Coins Revenge could have been better.

02:24:58.551 --> 02:24:59.072
[SPEAKER_07]: How so?

02:25:01.394 --> 02:25:03.836
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too short and they kind of

02:25:05.374 --> 02:25:06.156
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:25:06.196 --> 02:25:09.883
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no giving away the ending.

02:25:10.384 --> 02:25:10.705
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:25:11.627 --> 02:25:12.308
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, take care, buddy.

02:25:12.328 --> 02:25:13.129
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks a lot for the call.

02:25:14.512 --> 02:25:14.933
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

02:25:15.073 --> 02:25:15.334
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:25:15.394 --> 02:25:15.754
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

02:25:17.203 --> 02:25:21.326
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:21.426 --> 02:25:25.108
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody there sticking up for the PlayStation 3 and giving some more recommendations there.

02:25:25.128 --> 02:25:27.670
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, I have to say Megzi and Kristen say hi.

02:25:28.310 --> 02:25:29.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello!

02:25:29.771 --> 02:25:32.553
[SPEAKER_07]: And please ask when they're coming to California because we miss them.

02:25:32.793 --> 02:25:33.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I will.

02:25:33.353 --> 02:25:38.617
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a whole new generation of OLR listeners that have no idea who the OLR lesbians are and they need to be introduced.

02:25:38.777 --> 02:25:39.417
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to return.

02:25:39.517 --> 02:25:39.958
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

02:25:41.235 --> 02:25:44.497
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind them that episode 500 is coming up.

02:25:44.517 --> 02:25:46.638
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:25:46.658 --> 02:25:49.759
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:50.159 --> 02:25:52.080
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple tweets from SSJ100 Matt.

02:25:52.901 --> 02:25:54.842
[SPEAKER_07]: An idea ahead of its time from Sega.

02:25:55.262 --> 02:25:59.344
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade Heroes takes a look back at the Sega Super Circuit from 1989.

02:26:00.144 --> 02:26:07.187
[SPEAKER_07]: It links us to a story from Arcade Heroes which I'll get to in a minute after this call.

02:26:08.688 --> 02:26:09.749
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:09.789 --> 02:26:10.169
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

02:26:12.113 --> 02:26:12.813
[SPEAKER_01]: Word, dog.

02:26:13.274 --> 02:26:14.114
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Jim Sally.

02:26:14.614 --> 02:26:16.035
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy crap.

02:26:16.275 --> 02:26:18.156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's video.

02:26:18.396 --> 02:26:18.956
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

02:26:18.976 --> 02:26:20.097
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Sally's on the video.

02:26:20.597 --> 02:26:21.897
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you in the bathroom?

02:26:23.678 --> 02:26:25.359
[SPEAKER_07]: With him moving back and forth and all that?

02:26:25.379 --> 02:26:27.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, that wall looks like tile, like bathroom.

02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:28.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I see.

02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:31.642
[SPEAKER_07]: It did have a little bit of that vibe of the sitting on the toilet video.

02:26:31.662 --> 02:26:32.802
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting on the toilet.

02:26:33.402 --> 02:26:33.702
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my.

02:26:34.163 --> 02:26:34.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you're on a roof.

02:26:35.043 --> 02:26:36.444
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Canadian skyline.

02:26:36.464 --> 02:26:37.724
[SPEAKER_07]: He's outdoors smoking.

02:26:38.284 --> 02:26:39.325
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they do in Canada.

02:26:39.926 --> 02:26:40.546
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.

02:27:03.578 --> 02:27:04.839
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in my tundra gear here, man.

02:27:04.879 --> 02:27:06.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm all dressed up for the occasion.

02:27:06.299 --> 02:27:06.679
[SPEAKER_01]: See that?

02:27:07.079 --> 02:27:07.700
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking fly.

02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:09.881
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you an auction shot.

02:27:10.821 --> 02:27:17.304
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for wearing clothes when you call into the show because I'm afraid one of these days... I am disappointed at the... No, I'm kidding.

02:27:17.604 --> 02:27:17.944
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

02:27:18.284 --> 02:27:19.625
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm afraid that one of these...

02:27:20.645 --> 02:27:22.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, look at those guns!

02:27:22.646 --> 02:27:24.006
[SPEAKER_07]: Jim, it's a radio show.

02:27:24.066 --> 02:27:25.887
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to be able to see your muscles.

02:27:26.167 --> 02:27:28.308
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just for you, Rob.

02:27:28.328 --> 02:27:29.668
[SPEAKER_01]: He's invited us to the gun show.

02:27:29.788 --> 02:27:31.649
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?

02:27:31.929 --> 02:27:33.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my fanboy hearts and eyes.

02:27:33.769 --> 02:27:35.430
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we don't have a webcam in return.

02:27:36.050 --> 02:27:36.570
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get one.

02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:37.451
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get a webcam.

02:27:38.071 --> 02:27:40.532
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to just hear your soft voice anyway, buddy.

02:27:41.912 --> 02:27:43.252
[SPEAKER_04]: The webcam is at my house.

02:27:45.013 --> 02:27:47.974
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm looking at you in the studio right now.

02:27:49.629 --> 02:27:49.990
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's me.

02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:51.451
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give you a kiss on the cheek.

02:27:54.474 --> 02:27:56.255
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great radio, guys.

02:27:56.635 --> 02:27:57.416
[SPEAKER_01]: Great radio.

02:27:57.556 --> 02:27:58.417
[SPEAKER_01]: How smiley I am.

02:27:58.497 --> 02:27:59.378
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's do radio.

02:27:59.758 --> 02:28:00.579
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do radio.

02:28:00.699 --> 02:28:00.979
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

02:28:01.219 --> 02:28:03.982
[SPEAKER_07]: Jim, what kind of games have you been into lately?

02:28:04.662 --> 02:28:07.024
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, you guys talked about the Golden Axe not too long ago.

02:28:07.064 --> 02:28:08.566
[SPEAKER_01]: The great Golden Axe game on Sega.

02:28:09.626 --> 02:28:12.509
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I do remember playing that game and being vicious with my friends.

02:28:12.529 --> 02:28:16.012
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to play only two players at a time you could have, but there was three of us.

02:28:16.775 --> 02:28:19.397
[SPEAKER_01]: So whoever died would have to hand the controller off to the guy sitting out.

02:28:19.537 --> 02:28:21.319
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty much how we played the game the whole time.

02:28:22.019 --> 02:28:23.460
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of punch buggies, man.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:28.924
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to freak out when those little trolls would come out, and if we got to kill the trolls, we would usually kill each other, and then never get to the second level.

02:28:30.105 --> 02:28:33.808
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a hilarious style of gaming I haven't seen since I was young.

02:28:33.868 --> 02:28:38.192
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we used to do that too with Mario Brothers, is that, oh, you died, hand off the controller.

02:28:38.412 --> 02:28:39.533
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, pass it off, right?

02:28:40.153 --> 02:28:41.434
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's from the arcade, right?

02:28:41.454 --> 02:28:43.696
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you die, someone else gets to put a quarter in.

02:28:43.716 --> 02:28:44.777
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true, that's very true.

02:28:47.588 --> 02:28:48.348
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:29:14.904 --> 02:29:17.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, he has a hat that says Jim Sally.

02:29:17.388 --> 02:29:19.390
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I have a whole line of hats that say Jim Sally.

02:29:19.410 --> 02:29:19.991
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, check it out.

02:29:20.131 --> 02:29:24.117
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like a clothing line we can check out on Cafe Press?

02:29:24.137 --> 02:29:27.622
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to tell me what text you're using because it looks kind of like Cooper but not really.

02:29:28.787 --> 02:29:47.986
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this was like Jungle Geeks or something, I don't know, I use different texts, whatever they have at the, I use lids You need to do a Helvetica one, and make it look extra designed This show is getting too nerdy for me Rob just doesn't know typography I love though that we're getting a little glimpse of Canadia right there, I hope you don't, is that snow on the ground?

02:29:48.697 --> 02:29:49.217
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, look at this.

02:29:49.297 --> 02:29:50.718
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to shovel this shit, man.

02:29:51.419 --> 02:29:52.259
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not too long ago.

02:29:52.559 --> 02:29:56.041
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that white mythical stuff?

02:29:56.301 --> 02:29:57.402
[SPEAKER_07]: We're from California.

02:29:57.522 --> 02:29:58.763
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm like, ooh, what is that?

02:29:58.803 --> 02:30:00.444
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the record, it does snow in Alabama.

02:30:01.184 --> 02:30:03.685
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does snow 45 minutes up the hill here in California.

02:30:03.705 --> 02:30:07.047
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we are, like, less than two hours away from Lake Tahoe.

02:30:09.031 --> 02:30:09.912
[SPEAKER_01]: I can handle the cold, though.

02:30:09.932 --> 02:30:11.273
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what you get when you shovel the snow.

02:30:11.313 --> 02:30:14.916
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at those.

02:30:15.056 --> 02:30:17.258
[SPEAKER_07]: Jim, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.

02:30:17.298 --> 02:30:18.299
[SPEAKER_07]: But thanks so much for the call.

02:30:18.559 --> 02:30:19.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be a stranger.

02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:20.021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to hear from you.

02:30:20.441 --> 02:30:21.922
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I'm glad to hear from you guys, too.

02:30:21.982 --> 02:30:24.104
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say that I'm an angel.

02:30:24.164 --> 02:30:25.566
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this light shining in my face.

02:30:26.306 --> 02:30:28.108
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at you.

02:30:28.128 --> 02:30:33.753
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming down for Christmas time and I'm telling you, be good to everybody you see.

02:30:34.548 --> 02:30:38.651
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm watching you and I got a big eye.

02:30:38.671 --> 02:30:40.252
[SPEAKER_01]: You better look up.

02:30:40.632 --> 02:30:42.493
[SPEAKER_01]: You better look up.

02:30:42.573 --> 02:30:44.795
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, before this turns into the Blair Witch Project.

02:30:44.975 --> 02:30:47.436
[SPEAKER_01]: This germicidal call is brought to you by toothpicks.

02:30:47.716 --> 02:30:48.457
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what's in them?

02:30:48.677 --> 02:30:49.878
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, take care, buddy.

02:30:50.438 --> 02:30:51.459
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, Rob Roberts.

02:30:51.499 --> 02:30:52.339
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, Loki.

02:30:52.439 --> 02:30:53.240
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, JB.

02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:53.540
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

02:30:54.241 --> 02:30:55.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you, too.

02:30:56.302 --> 02:30:56.762
[SPEAKER_04]: Mwah.

02:30:58.403 --> 02:31:00.945
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell my husband I kissed another man tonight.

02:31:03.396 --> 02:31:05.777
[SPEAKER_07]: I think video is going to have to be a requirement pretty soon.

02:31:08.039 --> 02:31:09.099
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as I'm not on it.

02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:10.240
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:11.501
[SPEAKER_07]: We can point the camera over here.

02:31:12.601 --> 02:31:12.901
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:31:13.281 --> 02:31:15.183
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think it was a toothpick.

02:31:15.283 --> 02:31:16.583
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something.

02:31:16.663 --> 02:31:17.304
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it was weed.

02:31:17.344 --> 02:31:17.644
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:31:18.089 --> 02:31:19.890
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I got more tweets.

02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:21.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

02:31:24.032 --> 02:31:25.312
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what am I looking at here?

02:31:25.972 --> 02:31:29.054
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this was the tweet that SSJ100Matt sent before that call.

02:31:31.015 --> 02:31:34.656
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot here, but it had to do with RC cars on a track.

02:31:35.837 --> 02:31:37.377
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me see if I can open this.

02:31:37.557 --> 02:31:45.941
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, let me open this on the... This is why I should not use my iPad to do Twitter topics, because then I don't have the YouTubes hooked up to the stream.

02:31:47.622 --> 02:31:49.143
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

02:31:51.764 --> 02:31:52.584
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it'll make a mess.

02:31:56.625 --> 02:31:57.765
[SPEAKER_07]: The joys of live radio.

02:31:57.785 --> 02:32:04.128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm logging in right now to the right Twitter account because I have like four different Twitter accounts.

02:32:05.448 --> 02:32:06.228
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go look at this.

02:32:06.248 --> 02:32:08.189
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to look at the YouTube that was attached to this.

02:32:08.849 --> 02:32:10.129
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

02:32:14.071 --> 02:32:14.831
[SPEAKER_07]: Fast forward a little bit.

02:32:18.683 --> 02:32:19.123
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this?

02:32:20.565 --> 02:32:23.248
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Sega Super Circuit.

02:32:24.529 --> 02:32:32.577
[SPEAKER_07]: You used deluxe outrun cabinets that allowed players to control an RC car on a large track that was set up next to the units.

02:32:32.778 --> 02:32:33.338
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

02:32:33.358 --> 02:32:35.681
[SPEAKER_07]: And using cameras mounted to the cars...

02:32:37.358 --> 02:32:39.280
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a first person view of your vehicle.

02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:40.761
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the best thing ever.

02:32:41.482 --> 02:32:42.203
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty awesome.

02:32:42.223 --> 02:32:44.385
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Dan would flip his shit for this.

02:32:45.005 --> 02:32:45.266
[SPEAKER_07]: This is 1989.

02:32:45.826 --> 02:32:48.168
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, look at the video.

02:32:48.188 --> 02:32:49.409
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so adorable.

02:32:50.130 --> 02:32:51.191
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that is awesome.

02:32:51.211 --> 02:32:52.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan would completely flip his shit for this.

02:32:53.253 --> 02:32:55.275
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, that is so rad.

02:32:56.896 --> 02:32:59.459
[SPEAKER_07]: And it keeps breaking up when the car runs into the wall.

02:33:03.038 --> 02:33:12.448
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

02:33:12.689 --> 02:33:15.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I found a haiku from a friend of mine on Tumblr.

02:33:15.371 --> 02:33:18.074
[SPEAKER_07]: We're making Ranma work overtime with the Tumblr tonight, by the way.

02:33:18.355 --> 02:33:22.619
[SPEAKER_07]: All the links I've been talking about during the show, I'm making Ranma put on the Tumblr, so check that out.

02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:24.101
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so cool.

02:33:24.417 --> 02:33:25.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone Else Sucks

02:33:38.991 --> 02:33:41.572
[SPEAKER_07]: Haikus are easy, but sometimes they don't make sense.

02:33:41.932 --> 02:33:44.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Haiku does not take an S to make it plural.

02:33:45.894 --> 02:33:52.756
[SPEAKER_07]: Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion creator, Ron Gilbert, wants the game rights back, according to another tweet from SSJ100 Matt.

02:33:53.617 --> 02:33:54.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense.

02:33:54.657 --> 02:33:56.818
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming this has to do with the whole Disney acquisition.

02:33:58.338 --> 02:34:01.920
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, yeah, I wish I owned Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion, you know.

02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:03.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Mojang account

02:34:24.216 --> 02:34:24.718
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

02:34:24.998 --> 02:34:25.861
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying the game.

02:34:25.961 --> 02:34:26.422
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

02:34:26.442 --> 02:34:27.966
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm preparing for somebody else to buy me the game.

02:34:28.006 --> 02:34:28.888
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to at least play the beta.

02:34:29.209 --> 02:34:29.469
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:34:30.713 --> 02:34:32.998
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Tigerclaw tweets...

02:34:34.502 --> 02:34:36.604
[SPEAKER_07]: Hate using the classic controller on the Wii U?

02:34:37.084 --> 02:34:38.865
[SPEAKER_07]: Use the PlayStation 2s instead.

02:34:39.245 --> 02:34:48.172
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there's a conversion kit that's going to be going on sale in Japan that will allow you to connect a DualShock to the Wii U. You know, if you don't want to use the classic controller or what have you.

02:34:49.012 --> 02:34:49.993
[SPEAKER_07]: The kit's from Datel.

02:34:50.053 --> 02:34:53.175
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll cost about $25 or 1,980 yen.

02:34:53.496 --> 02:34:55.177
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes on sale December 8th.

02:34:55.977 --> 02:34:57.538
[SPEAKER_07]: No idea if this will be sold elsewhere.

02:34:57.719 --> 02:35:02.462
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so cool that you would spend more money on a conversion kit than the actual controller.

02:35:03.166 --> 02:35:04.987
[SPEAKER_04]: Sixaxis, all the things.

02:35:06.827 --> 02:35:08.088
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see.

02:35:08.468 --> 02:35:15.511
[SPEAKER_07]: And also from Tigerclaw, Miyamoto wonders, is story really necessary when gameplay will do?

02:35:16.892 --> 02:35:20.895
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just based on title alone, I haven't even looked at the story.

02:35:20.955 --> 02:35:27.379
[SPEAKER_07]: I think an ideal game has both, but Atari 2600 games, I guess, didn't really have a lot of story.

02:35:27.459 --> 02:35:29.101
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they did if you read the instruction manual.

02:35:29.541 --> 02:35:31.302
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you had to to visualize that stuff.

02:35:32.003 --> 02:35:32.823
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's see.

02:35:35.685 --> 02:35:38.147
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a link to a story from Gamasutra.

02:35:38.187 --> 02:35:40.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm having to read this live because we just got linked to it on Twitter.

02:35:41.109 --> 02:35:43.010
[SPEAKER_07]: But looking at the quote here from Miyamoto...

02:35:43.971 --> 02:35:44.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

02:36:00.736 --> 02:36:08.020
[SPEAKER_07]: who is this Taro Kudo, the creator of scenario design on the game, said, quote, I didn't think we necessarily needed a lengthy story like in an RPG.

02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:15.603
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, we looked at the characteristics of a portable game that can be played little by little in small pieces and packed in lots of little episodes and ideas.

02:36:16.023 --> 02:36:18.885
[SPEAKER_07]: I always did like putting in little ideas, so I actually enjoyed it.

02:36:19.625 --> 02:36:30.193
[SPEAKER_07]: A good game doesn't need story, but, you know, it's nice to have if the type of genre necessitates it.

02:36:30.633 --> 02:36:36.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, a football game might not necessarily need story, but could a story make it more awesome?

02:36:36.958 --> 02:36:41.321
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what makes wrestling games awesome, because it's like soap operas for broly dudes.

02:36:41.982 --> 02:36:47.026
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, from Degenerate Johnny tonight, OLR, which is faster, running or rolling?

02:36:47.046 --> 02:36:47.266
[SPEAKER_07]: Rolling.

02:36:48.151 --> 02:36:53.372
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're a monk in World of Warcraft, rolling will give you a temporary speed boost if you spec the right talent for it.

02:36:55.953 --> 02:36:56.233
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark.

02:36:56.893 --> 02:36:58.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends if it's uphill or downhill.

02:36:59.894 --> 02:37:00.594
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

02:37:01.255 --> 02:37:04.815
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a flat surface, I would think running is probably going to be a little faster.

02:37:04.855 --> 02:37:08.116
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, if you're going downhill, rolling might actually be more advantageous.

02:37:08.236 --> 02:37:08.737
[SPEAKER_07]: And dangerous.

02:37:09.677 --> 02:37:10.817
[SPEAKER_07]: Consider your terrain.

02:37:10.957 --> 02:37:12.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Rolling and rolling.

02:37:12.418 --> 02:37:14.138
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a Street Fighter Alpha 3 ending.

02:37:15.598 --> 02:37:17.400
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:19.181
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight.

02:37:19.301 --> 02:37:20.902
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that do it for Last Minute Stories as well?

02:37:21.043 --> 02:37:21.623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

02:37:21.803 --> 02:37:24.305
[SPEAKER_07]: And that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:24.806 --> 02:37:26.907
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show.

02:37:27.208 --> 02:37:29.630
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate your guys' support every single week.

02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:32.472
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know it's a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but you know what?

02:37:32.492 --> 02:37:35.795
[SPEAKER_07]: The last few have all been like three and a half hour epic episodes.

02:37:35.835 --> 02:37:40.419
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, a short one as the news is winding down for the year, I don't think it's too bad.

02:37:40.899 --> 02:37:43.981
[SPEAKER_07]: We are moving in, of course, to the year end and another year of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:44.441 --> 02:37:49.104
[SPEAKER_07]: And we couldn't have done it for the past coming up on 11 years without your support.

02:37:49.605 --> 02:37:52.747
[SPEAKER_07]: And all we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:37:53.087 --> 02:37:55.428
[SPEAKER_07]: Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:55.448 --> 02:37:58.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Word of mouth is all we got, and it's worked out pretty well for us.

02:37:59.571 --> 02:38:04.214
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we pull the plug on the show, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

02:38:04.957 --> 02:38:05.498
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start.

02:38:05.638 --> 02:38:13.425
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought tonight is Fog of World is a very interesting app on the iPhone, but $5?

02:38:15.166 --> 02:38:19.010
[SPEAKER_07]: Have I just been spoiled by all the 99 cent stuff that's available on iOS?

02:38:19.450 --> 02:38:20.771
[SPEAKER_07]: I think $5 is a little much.

02:38:21.612 --> 02:38:22.933
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

02:38:23.254 --> 02:38:28.318
[SPEAKER_04]: I've decided that if I'm ever going to wear a watch again, it's going to be the Hello Kitty Nuka watch.

02:38:29.279 --> 02:38:30.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Nuka makes awesome watches.

02:38:31.061 --> 02:38:31.481
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

02:38:32.324 --> 02:38:34.145
[SPEAKER_07]: and lastly but not leastly, Loki.

02:38:36.667 --> 02:38:40.469
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I get this stupid mob arena plug-in working because it's really frustrating me.

02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:41.390
[SPEAKER_06]: It's giving me a headache.

02:38:43.271 --> 02:38:46.033
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that does it for another episode here at Orange Launch Radio.

02:38:46.093 --> 02:38:54.358
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be back to do it all again next week and since we learned tonight that it is starting before the next show, happy Hanukkah to all our listeners out there who celebrate it.

02:38:55.019 --> 02:38:56.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, happy Hanukkah.

02:38:57.128 --> 02:38:57.549
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

02:38:57.849 --> 02:38:58.791
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great week, everybody.

02:38:58.811 --> 02:39:01.236
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time on Orange... Eat lots of latkes!

02:39:01.436 --> 02:39:03.219
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:03.239 --> 02:39:03.981
[SPEAKER_07]: Feed me gelt.

02:39:04.442 --> 02:39:05.443
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:05.764 --> 02:39:06.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

02:39:06.713 --> 02:39:09.735
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:10.355 --> 02:39:14.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

02:39:15.179 --> 02:39:24.065
