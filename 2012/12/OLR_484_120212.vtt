Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, December 2nd, 2012, a new Wii console is unveiled, a classic console is reborn on iPhone and iPad, and could Sony be planning a break apart controller for the next Playstation?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December 2nd, 2012, episode number 484.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about the latest and greatest in the gaming world and some other things too with my co-hosts. First off, say hello to the one and only Dark Soccer Hour, Jamie Summers.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
How are you, Jamie Summers?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Doing alright.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah? What's new with you? Hanukkah's coming up real quick, isn't it?

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, I think it starts the 9th. Yeah, so I've got a...

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Wait, are you going to be here next week if it starts the 9th? We better figure that out.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
I need to find out if the temple is having something. Well, I'll verify the dates and...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm glad I thought to ask.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, no, because usually my temple does something for the first in whatever, you know, Shabbat is during Hanukkah.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Right.

01:27.000 --> 01:40.000
So I'd have to find out. But I mean, I'm already getting out my little... I have this thing I got at Target of all places that's like little felt candles and you can put them up on this banner.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
I'm already getting some of the decorations out of all places. The grocery outlet had six pointed blue Christmas ornaments.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
So I was like, I'm going to use these.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Why not?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, so hooray.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
All right. We'll also say hello to Tech Master Loki joining us here in studio.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Hello.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
How are you, Loki?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm fine.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
McDonald's again during the show. Is that like...

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It's cheap.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
It's like your standard thing now.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, it's cheap and I was over there running errands.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, OK.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Not at McDonald's but in the plaza with McDonald's.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I need a Big Mac. Stat.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
All right. What else is new with you?

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
Now I'm still trying to fix the Minecraft server, trying to get this one plug-in mob arena to work correctly.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
And I fixed... There was an error in the config file. I fixed that. It's still not accepting any of the commands though.

02:28.000 --> 02:38.000
So I have to look at the permissions again because I took the new permission program out and put the old one back in because I figured, OK, it was just this config file that was broken.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
And so now I have to get that to work and if it doesn't work with this one and I have to try the new config or the new permissions file again.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
It's just this one plug-in is just being a pain in the ass. So, I don't know.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
Correct me if I'm wrong but I think I read something on the Twitters or something about Josh's first gaming experience or something like that or you're trying to breed him a little more as a gamer?

03:00.000 --> 03:10.000
Not his first gaming experience, but no, he wanted to hit the buttons on the arcade cabinet. So we put it on. I turned it on and put Bubble Bubble on and he wants to hit the buttons.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
He likes hitting the button to make the bubbles blow from the dinosaur.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
That's how we started. Does anyone remember? Does anyone in the studio maybe remember like what turned them on to video games in the first place?

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
Like I know you have to have like a really young memory for most of us because I know most of us started in like the Coleco Atari era or whatever.

03:27.000 --> 03:41.000
Does anybody remember? Like for me, I think like I don't remember a lot being a kid but I think the fact that I could control what was on the television like besides just the remote but like I could actually like make my own TV show of sorts was kind of what turned me on to gaming.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I don't remember what it was exactly.

03:43.000 --> 03:52.000
For the record, Hanukkah starts on the 8th so I was right in general as far as daytime goes. But there's nothing going on so I'll be here.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Okay, phew, just checking.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I'll let my candle before I go.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Because if I needed a guest host, I like to know that stuff in advance.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I mean unless you just want to give me the night off, I don't know.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
You can take a night off, just let me know.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
Alright, also say hello to the ever-present fourth guest on our show, The Chatters. You can participate live with us at live.vognetwork.com.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
We are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern or thereabouts right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:18.000 --> 04:27.000
And I say thereabouts because sometimes his show runs a little long and that's okay because he's always kind enough to have us on at the end and we do this little like tease across.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
So if you've never listened to Bobby's show before, you're missing a little kind of bonus segment with us for lack of a better term at the end of his show every week.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
And it's a good show. Like the other 50 minutes of the show are great too. He's one guy talking about games.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
I just like to give him a nice little plug there every now and then. And you can check out all the great shows that make up the lineup of The Voice of Geek Network at vognetwork.com.

04:50.000 --> 05:01.000
Again, that's vognetwork.com. Other great shows, Pod Culture, Girls Gone Wow, lots of stuff and hopefully new stuff next year. Who knows? We'll see.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
Also in the chat room, AcidicVampire in our chat room says, after you were introduced DarkSakura, AcidicVampire said,

05:09.000 --> 05:20.000
Mrs. Vicarian, I don't know about this because thanks to the Omega DLC this week, you might be going for girls this time, right?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, she's dead, so I mean...

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Don't spoil! Oh my gosh!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh my God!

05:28.000 --> 05:41.000
She's only in the DLC, I'll put it that way. So it's only a moment. And I just appreciate it. Clearly she has still some residual going on for Miss Aria.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, there is a little bit of tension going on there, isn't there?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
My favorite line, I love it when you're feisty. Wink!

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
AcidicVampire has changed the line to Mrs. Candrose. There you go.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
No, no, Vicarian.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
You know what this is going to turn into? This is going to turn into a freaking TV series like they have with Grey's Anatomy or something like that.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Where it's going to be on a starship and it's just going to be drama and people sleeping with each other.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Because that's all that Mass Effect is really. That and a third person shooter.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah, is that a problem?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah, those shows suck.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
I'd say it's more like The Walking Dead because I think there's a lot of people that weren't listening to Bobby tonight because The Walking Dead is on at the same time on the East Coast.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
It has zombies in it. I mean, this is like drama.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Well, Mass Effect has aliens in it. Alright, look.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
And grunt.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
Moving on. I actually, I will say this. We're going to get into our gaming week soon enough. I will say this.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
Just to make Loki happy with my fandom coming full circle, I did place my order, my $60 order for the Mass Effect trilogy on Playstation 3.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Which will be shipped the day the game is launched.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Well, now it's complete.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
That means the only system I don't have it on now is Wii U.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
But I'm going to, I'm holding off on that until they fix some of the DLC.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Which I do need to issue an errata.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
You know, heaven forbid we ever misspeak on Orange Launch Radio and I say something wrong.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
But I did last week. I said that none of the multiplayer DLC was available on Mass Effect 3 Wii U.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
That is incorrect. It does include the first three multiplayer download packs.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
But I believe it is missing this most recent one still.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
It is still missing something that the other consoles have.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
But it's still lame. The options that you're not allowed to carry over.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, well that's a whole other thing.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Which people will get to hear once a certain podcast is available.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Get careful. I'll have you taken out and back and roughed up too like a chatter who was trying to spoil it earlier.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
But what was I going to say about all that?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I don't know if this is just rumor or fan wank or what.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
But supposedly Mass Effect 3 Wii U is selling better than BioWare had anticipated.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
So they are looking at, I mean I guess that kind of stuff is always a possibility.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
We only thought we'd sell a copy and we sold two.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Who knows? Who knows?

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. I want to do a kickoff topic real quick.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
It's been very stormy here in Northern California over the past few days. It's just finally cleared up.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
You call this a storm?

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Well, for us yes. I do call it a storm. It is very much a storm for Northern California.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Because our part of the land is not built to handle the same types of weather as other parts.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
But anyway.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
This land is your land.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm just saying it's been flooding everywhere. I'm surprised you guys didn't drive through flooded streetways to get here.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
But yeah, it's been pretty crazy. I don't know about you guys but on nights like these I like to stay in and play video games.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
So like over this stormy season are there any games that you're looking forward to catching up on?

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Things you're trying to play over the next month or so?

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
I know for me I have a huge backlog of games on Steam that I've really got to get through.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And that doesn't even count the Mass Effect trilogy.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
But I've also got some games coming in from my rental service.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm going to give Forza a try because some of our VoG fans have been talking about it.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And whatever else they end up sending me.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
So I don't know. Is there any catch up games?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Like things, Loki, you were talking about before the show.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Like I have all these games I haven't even touched.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Well yeah, it's because I just remembered to go through.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
I'd actually had, I was adding all my Steam codes for the humble bundles I have and stuff.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Like past ones.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Like there's some that I haven't even redeemed yet.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And most of them I have not played yet.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
And even the stuff from like the last Summer Sale or whatever.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Most of the games that I've bought there I have not played.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
So I have a ton of games I could be playing.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
And then on top of that, just the stuff that I did buy and played a little bit of on console.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
That I still have to play more and more Minecraft.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
So I got plenty of stuff to keep me busy.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Jim Sally in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Actually Rob, Walking Dead is on now on the East Coast and I'm skipping it for you.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I guess apparently it's on at 9.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Well thank you guys for skipping that show to come be with us.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
That's why they invented DVR and Hulu and other ways to watch TV shows later on.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Even though I have yet to watch any Walking Dead.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I'm not hating on it.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
I hardly watch any TV shows unless it's RuPaul's Drag Race.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Or Happy Endings actually.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I strangely like that show.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It's weird. Anyway.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Dark Sakura, anything that you're trying to catch up on?

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Well I've been trying to get my newly purchased copy of Sonic Generations to download.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Because I've really wanted to play that game.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
And I got it way cheap on Steam.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I love Steam.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm playing that stupid Faerie Solitaire game.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Because I want to beat it this year.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
But other than that, I got another game that just looks so cool to me.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
And it had been kind of on my radar for a little bit.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
But I finally just broke down and bought it.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
It's a game called Closure.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I haven't played it yet.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Where it's basically all black and white.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
And it uses the light to create your area around you.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
So basically wherever the light shines, it exists.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
If the light isn't shining there, it doesn't exist.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Meaning you can create holes in the ground and drop down into other levels.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
And it's a really neat application of physics.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So it's been on my radar for a little while and I've wanted to play it.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
So I finally just downloaded it.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Other than that, I'm playing my usual.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
There you go.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I touched WoW.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
It liked it.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
You pretty much just did your gaming week together with the question, didn't you?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, because a lot of it's combined.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I've downloaded the stuff, I've prepped it.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Now it just doesn't matter sitting down and playing it.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
You were talking a little bit about Project Greenlight stuff before the show.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Is that something you've been participating with?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm looking to see what the new stuff coming in is and if it interests me or not.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I've watched the trailers for a few things and I was like, eh, crap.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It just hasn't interested me.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I've got like one thing.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Not every idea is something you're going to jump up and go woo at.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But there's some good things on there.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I've been poking around in there too.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
But the other thing going on is that I want to hook up the Dreamcast.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
And actually I've had this urge to play through Grandia 2 again.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
So I'm thinking about playing it.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Or the SNES and playing through Earthbound.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah, I was thinking about revisiting some classics too.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't know.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I thought it would be fun to get one of those little streaming things for the TV

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
and do a little streaming session of a game.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And that's something I've been talking about for forever.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
And it's one of those new media things that we've completely missed the boat on.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
You know what we should do?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We should actually play through Secret of Mana.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
It would be fun.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
O2 player?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Why not?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Why not?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't even know if I've beaten that game.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I think I got all the way to the end.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
But I don't think I've ever actually beaten it.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
I have beaten it.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Same thing with Secret of Evermore.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Go figure.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You and secrets, Rob.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Well I have a whole week off from Christmas to New Year.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And I was originally going to go to Vegas.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
But that probably isn't happening.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
So I'm going to have all this time and nothing to do.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
So we'll see.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
All right.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Since we got into our gaming weeks already, Loki, why don't you go next?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
How was your gaming week?

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
This week I played Black Ops 2 a bit more.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
We finally finished up playing all the multiplayer maps.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And now we're just kind of going back and playing whatever we want to play.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
And I finished the single player campaign, which actually ended kind of short.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It was starting to get really good.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And then it's like, and done.

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
It's like that one that they were showing kind of in all the trailers and stuff where all the drones are attacking L.A. and that kind of thing.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
That's the second to last mission of the game.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
And so right after that, it's like, oh, we're going to attack where the source is coming from.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And game over.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
It's like, okay, that was interesting.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
And I guess there's multiple endings to the game.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
But, dude, I don't even know, like, all the different things that you do in the game.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
There's only like a, it must have been like three, maybe two second clip.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
It's like something happens and then I guess that changes based on how you play the game.

13:51.000 --> 13:59.000
So, woohoo, a five second clip that I, you know, affected by playing the game differently in different spots.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I don't know. It's just kind of weird.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I don't know if, I probably wouldn't go back and replay through all the campaign again.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
But it was fun the first time.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It's just, I wish it was longer because it was actually pretty cool.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
And it was getting really good and then just like, done.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
We're done with that.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Also played Far Cry 3.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
That game is fantastic.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
And, you know, playing through the single player campaign of that.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Very cinematic.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
You know, I love the detail in the jungle.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
I mean, it's pretty awesome for like even a console game.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Reminds me a lot of like Just Cause 2.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Just, you know, the locale and everything.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And even the AI is kind of stupid sometimes.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Which is kind of fun.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
So I like that.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
And I also like how chaotic everything is with, you know, you'll be going up to attack somebody.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
And all of a sudden they get eaten by a tiger or something.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
It's just, you know, oh hey, there's a tiger there.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
That's unusual.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
But one of the fun things I like doing with it is, you know, you can hunt animals in the game.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
And it's kind of an exploit, I guess.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But the animals can't attack you in a car.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
So you just drive over the animal with the car.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Oh, we got to hunt a tiger because it's very dangerous.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Hit it with the car!

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Peeta's calling and telling you to stop.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Peeta can bite my ass.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
It's fantastic.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
It's like, oh, you know, you're trying to kill me.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You know, I'm going to shoot at you.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Get you to run back towards me.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Hop in my car and hit you with the car.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Or, you know, the same thing with Komodo dragons.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Like, they'll just gang up on you and just boop, boop, back and forth.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
And they're dead.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And they'll collect their skins.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Or even better is that you get these animals to chase after you.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
They run back to, like, one of the outposts that you've taken over.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And your men kill them.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Or you can hang out at one of those outposts where, like, these animals are normally.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
And they'll just keep spawning and your men will keep killing them and you just loot everything.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Even if one of the guys dies, you just loot him.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
It's fantastic.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I just love manipulating all that stuff.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
And it's a pretty interesting storyline.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
I went through one of the first, like, kind of drug trip moments in the game.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That was interesting.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I really like the way they did it, though.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
It was pretty cool.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And let's see what else.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
A little bit of Minecraft.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Still trying to get this damn plug in the work.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
And it's been pissing me off.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
But just some reminder stuff.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
We've got, you know, it's at vog-minecraft.com to check out.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Right now it's just a dynamic map.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
But eventually, once I get everything working on the server, I'm going to actually...

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm going to load that site and hope it doesn't break the show as it loads.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
It shouldn't break the show.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It's not that bad.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Wow.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It looks like the map has even expanded more since the last time I checked.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
It's possible.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
We've been still trying to...

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
We've been running into some things that are not working because I'm loading in so many plugins.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Like certain...

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
I think it's a lot of the craft book stuff was just causing things to not work right.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
Because they have different blocks that make the mine cart do different things.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And so some of them weren't stopping.

17:03.000 --> 17:11.000
Or my whole roller coaster thing stopped working because all the blocks that made up the roller coaster were actually the reverse direction blocks in that plugin.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
So that was kind of fun.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I haven't logged into Minecraft in forever.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
I'm sorry, you guys.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Nah, no one has.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I see Hitstun talking about it in the VoG thread.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, he does.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
He does.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
But...

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
We need to set a night.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
This is a Minecraft orgy night, but not like an actual orgy.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I wanted to do that, but eventually we'll get there.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Right now, like I said, I'm trying to set up this arena.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Because I know I've got everything in there and it's pretty awesome.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I just need to get that actual hit off the ground.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
But yeah, you can go to VoG-Minecraft.com for the 3D map and you can actually poke around and see what people are building and stuff.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
And you can actually see people when they're in-game.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
And I think you can even chat with them too through that window, which is kind of neat.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
I gotta ask you about this since you're a Minecraft fan and all the listeners as well.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
Because I'm sure a lot of the listeners that we have would not have seen this, but it's really funny.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
I actually found this on Reddit on the gamers community.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Have you ever heard of this app that they have on the iPhone called a grinder?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Have you ever heard of that?

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
It's kind of like a friend finder, but a lot of people use it for more than friends, if you know what I'm saying, right?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
A lot of people do that.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Well, somebody set up this profile on there called Steve.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
And they actually have a picture of Steve from Minecraft.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
It says, no creepers, please.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Hello, my name is Steve. I like to go mining in caves and crafting things on my workbench.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
My favorite food is cookies.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
So somebody messages him out of the blue.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Hi, sexy. Lovely blue eyes. Like the sea.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
And they send a picture.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Any other pictures for me there, sexy?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
And Steve replies back, hello, sir. How are you?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Yes, I have many a picture for you.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
And sends back a picture with the pig and the lamb, like from the game.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Like these are game screenshots.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Like you can't mistake this for a video game.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And the guy replies back, so very handsome indeed.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Do you live on a farm?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
And Steve replies, I move around a lot.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
I often have to quickly build shelter out of dirt and cobblestone before sunset.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
And the guy replies back, so you're a handyman.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You must be quite fit too then.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Are you into older men?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Another picture perhaps.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
And so another in-game picture comes back and says, you know, I can outrun skeletons and zombies.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And the guy like doesn't get it.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Wanna meet?

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
And so Steve replies, okay, have you got any redstone for a compass?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
What are your X and Z coordinates?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
And the guy goes, I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And so the guy replies back with a picture of a compass.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Well, obviously the guy's trolling.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
He's hella trolling, but it's funny that the guy's fallen for, poor guy.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I don't think he's falling for it. I mean, come on.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I don't see how anyone can be that stupid.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
You never know. You never know.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Unless, you know, unless he's like.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
This guy probably knows nothing about.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Unless he's like visually impaired or something like that.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
And so his, you know, computer or whatever is reading back the text.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
And he doesn't, doesn't realize that it's, you know, a picture of a, you know.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I have a question though.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Like, can you decide who, uh, uh, like what your character looks like?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yes.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Okay, good.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
You can completely draw.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Even though I don't own the camera.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Yes, I play as Zangief.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Let me link that in chat. There you go.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
See if you want to see that for yourself there.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah, so.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Okay, someone did the best thing on Tumblr.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
They took Garris and Tali and put them in, um, a horse drawn carriage and then had, uh, Gordon Freeman decorating a tree.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
You and your fandom need to stop derailing the show. Yes, Loki?

20:32.000 --> 20:40.000
Well, one of the other things I saw an article about how to render like, you know, Minecraft worlds and stuff like that to like pretty awesome 3D images.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
So probably do that too at some point.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Maybe on the website once, you know, like I said, once I get this stupid plug in the work.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
Then it'll be all gravy, but it's just right now, it's just refusing to accept any of the commands I put into it.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
It's just like, nope, no thanks, sorry, not going to do that.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Um, so I just have to figure out why.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
It's something with the permissions now because I got the config file working correctly, I think.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
So, I don't know, we'll figure it out eventually.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
Um, and then also I played, uh, was it, uh, SkillRex?

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Um, or Skrillex, I guess?

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
The, uh, Legend of Skrillex or whatever the hell that game was.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It's some like Skrillex game.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Oh yeah, I think that's a news item later.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah, but it's pretty awesome.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
It's, uh...

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Really? Skrillex? Awesome?

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, the game's awesome. I think it was kind of cool.

21:31.000 --> 21:37.000
I mean, it's a little bit like Zelda and stuff, but it's done by the same guy that did the, um, Perfect Strangers game.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Oh, okay.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Does it have Belki in it?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
That game was pretty fucking rad.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Alright, I give it a pass then.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
So, that was it.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Alright, uh, My Gaming Week. Not a lot of new stuff.

21:49.000 --> 21:57.000
Uh, Warcraft got a big patch this week, so I was playing a lot of that because, you know, there's upgrades to go for and, uh, things from my other show, Horde House.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Um, I did play some more, uh, Wii U.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
I played more Super Mario Brothers U, or what, a new Super Mario Brothers U.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Um, I haven't beat it yet, but I'm getting really close.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I think I'm on the last level before the castle level, so...

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
And then I hear once you beat it, like any Mario game, it's gonna have, you know, all new stuff.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And I know, I already know these exits have multiple levels and shit, so I'm having a good time with it.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
It's, it's fun.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
Uh, also on the Wii U, I did download something new.

22:24.000 --> 22:32.000
Uh, I decided to kind of try out the process of a download title, and so I wanted to download one that looked interesting to me.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
So I checked out Mighty Switch Force Hyper Drive Edition.

22:35.000 --> 22:45.000
Uh, first I gotta say, though, again with the whole Nintendo LOL online part, not the most fun to try and download.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Well, I don't know. I guess it was a step above the Wii.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
You go in, you fill out your information, you can at least use the little touch pad, which makes it faster, whatever.

22:53.000 --> 23:01.000
And it will download in the background while you play other games, but if you turn your system off, the download stops.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
Unless you go into download management and say, power off my system when the downloads are done.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Like, it's not really proactive about it, so I kind of learned that the hard way.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Alright, so whatever. I had to wait for the download.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
Once the thing was finally done downloading, it took four minutes to install.

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
Like, what are you doing where you just downloaded the whole, now what are you doing for four minutes to install a game that's only half a gig?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah, but the PS3 does the same thing.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
It's not as bad, though. Like, PS3, 60 seconds tops for a download game.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Four minutes on the Wii U? I don't know.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Well, it must be that underclocked CPU that they rumored to have in that system.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah, it was a little clunky, so I was not a fan of that.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
But whatever, I mean, it's not the worst thing I've ever experienced.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
And again, that's not a slam on the game, that's just, you know, I was trying to see what the Wii U download experience would be like.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
And I was like, alright, well that's different.

23:53.000 --> 24:02.000
But the game itself is fun. It's a pretty simple, well I shouldn't say simple because that makes it sound bad, but the premise is pretty simplistic.

24:02.000 --> 24:09.000
It plays like a little platformer. I guess they had a version of this on the 3DS in the download shop, but I never played it.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
Which lends itself fabulously to Loki's whole theory about all your DS games are going to come out on Wii U, just wait.

24:17.000 --> 24:27.000
But what was cool about this is that, you know, you can either play with the action going on on the TV and like a little radar on your Wii U pad along with the lives and all that.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Or you can hit a button and have the whole game on the pad.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
So I like those games where you kind of have the option to do one or the other.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
But the game itself, you're trying to find these five prisoners in a level, and they're all anime babes.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
You're trying to find these prisoners in a level and you have like jump, shoot, and switch.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
And the switch will make blocks appear and disappear.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
And it's either like one way or the other way. There's only like two configurations.

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
But then it gets more complicated where the blocks might actually be like launchers from like Sonic the Hedgehog that'll like make you fire in a certain direction.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
And then you have to use these bomb enemies, put them in the launchers to explode blocks across the page.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
You know, just kind of like a puzzle platformer.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But I like those type of games, so it's fun.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
It looks like there's only about 20 levels, though.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
But it's already getting, like you're really having to think like even as early as like stage four or five.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
AlphaKnanagram wants to say about Mighty Switch Force in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
The thing is, Mighty Switch Force wasn't a DS-ish game.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
It mainly just used the top screen so it could come out on the Vita.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
And that's very true. You can play the whole game on the touchpad only.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
So you can do the game all on one screen.

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
The second screen enhances it, and I use that term very loosely, with the whole radar.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Which is a neat thing, but it's not necessary to the game.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
And I'm okay with that because I don't think the 3DS, or ex-

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
The Wii U.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I mean the same thing, I mean.

25:56.000 --> 26:05.000
I don't think the Wii U should whore that second screen too much because you're not physically capable of seeing two screens at once.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
Unless it's one of those Nintendo Land games where you hold the thing up to the TV and like the little ninja game or things like that.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
Like there's some games that are built that way, but most of the gaming experiences aren't built like that.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
So I'm okay with the second screen being like informational.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Glance down here occasionally.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
A sub-screen that you don't have to hit the button to switch to.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Like I think that's an okay use of it.

26:28.000 --> 26:38.000
AlphaKananagram also wants to point out that Mighty Flip Champs, which is kind of like a cousin series also by WayForward, did come out on the PSP.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Maybe it was a PS Mini.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Anyhow, I like the game. It's a $10 game.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
That's where most of the Wii U downloads seem to be priced. It's around 10-15 bucks.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I thought it was-

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
I didn't sit there going, I wasted my money on this experiment.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I was like, oh this game is kind of fun and I would play this again.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
It would be really awesome if I could like beam it to my 3DS and have it on the go, but I know that's asking a lot of Nintendo.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Anyway.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
So before we get into the news, quickly some plugs.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Of course follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
And you can also follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
We are on Google Plus as well under Orange Lounge Radio.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
And I want to plug our mailbag. You can always send us emails. We'll get to those in the second half of the show.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
And again, please help us support all indie podcasts.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
I always like to just plug all indie podcasts and the hard people.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
You know, the hard working people behind producing these shows.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
And especially the ones on the Voice of the Geeks Network.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Voggenetwork.com. Especially those shows.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news. Loki.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
So holy crap, Nintendo announces another system.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
But except it's only for Canadian. I know it's Canada.

27:55.000 --> 28:02.000
Wii Mini. And what Wii Mini is is a really small version of the Wii that lacks a lot of things.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
Including SD card support. Wi-Fi support. Or actually any internet connection support.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
And yeah. It's basically just if you want to play games.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
And that is it. Some games.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
But it's pretty. It's pretty small. And I kind of like the way it looks.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
I mean, it looks like it's got a top loader disk drive to it.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
And it's red. Well at least it's black with red trim on it.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
And the controllers that come with it are red.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
It's going to be available December 7th for $99.99. I'm assuming that's Canadian.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
And also not compatible with GameCube disks. But most of the Wii's nowadays are not.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
So that's not a big surprise.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
Yeah. So game system. Red nunchuck. Red Wiimote Plus.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
And sensor bar. Power adapter. And composite cable. For $99.99.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Pretty cool looking.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Lots of people on there. I'm surprised you're speaking as nicely of this as you are.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Lots of people on the interwebs. Don't get it. Why this? You're pushing the Wii U.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
What the hell is this about?

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
This is one of the price points down really low. And I think they figured a lot of people.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
Let's be honest. Their online was kind of eh. I mean it was alright.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
You can download virtual console games and stuff like that.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
Well obviously you can't do that now. You can't download any DLC or any downloads whatsoever with this.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
But I mean they had that kind of in place where not a lot of people were probably utilizing it.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
Especially like grandpa and grandma are probably not downloading virtual console games.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
They probably don't even know how to do that.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
So this is more trying to get into I guess those places where people are looking for a cheap gaming system.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
You know they haven't jumped into this. And maybe you get hooked on this and you'll buy something else.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
Although it's kind of weird to see this coming out so late because there's really not a whole lot of Wii games coming out.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Like you know if this was something that they were introducing towards the end of the life cycle.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
Not like literally at you know eleven fifty nine of the clock you know Wii.

30:09.000 --> 30:16.000
I mean it's pretty much done here. But there's already a gigantic library out there.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I mean it's not there's like a lack of Wii software.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah that's true. But I mean I don't think that they would want to try building up there.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
It's kind of like what they did remember with the PSP. They had like a PSP version or whatever with no Wi-Fi and stuff.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
And it was supposed to be really cheap. I just I don't know. It's kind of weird that they put that out.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
But it's a little weird but I get it. I mean I do get it.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
And I think the thing we have to remember is that if you're listening to this show chances are very strongly this console was not for you.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
Like if you have if you're listening to this show and you haven't bought a Wii by now.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
I don't think like Nintendo was going to win you over. And this really wasn't meant for you.

30:52.000 --> 30:59.000
This is really just for people who want you know oh I've always wanted Wii Sports but oh it's only $99 now.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
Maybe I'll get it now. Or you know a real cheap alternative to have in the kids room.

31:04.000 --> 31:12.000
And the fact that it doesn't have internet actually is a great selling point for parents who might be trying to control you know very heavily what their kids are doing.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
There's a lot of households that want to lock that down. Maybe not the type again that are listening to this show.

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
But I just think you know this is just for a different type of audience obviously and I think most people are figuring that out.

31:24.000 --> 31:32.000
But it's weird that it's only coming out in Canada. Like is it a test market thing?

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
I think it's a test market because if you think about it they don't want to mass produce these things and have them not sell.

31:36.000 --> 31:45.000
So these are just a mass producing for one market and then that way if it's a flop you're not stuck with millions of these or probably not millions but hundreds of thousands of them.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
You're only stuck with you know a few thousands instead.

31:49.000 --> 31:56.000
Also something to consider it's not completely unheard of for Nintendo to do this thing well after the other console has started.

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
Like I believe correct me if I'm wrong but those top loader NES's came out like right when the Super Nintendo's were already coming out.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
And then I think the Super Nintendo got a remake as well when the 64's came out.

32:08.000 --> 32:18.000
I don't remember if the 64's got a remake around GameCube but you still had like the Pokemon 64 and there were some other little remodels that came out you know relatively late in the life.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
And then GameCube.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
PS2 did the same thing and PS1 yeah.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Right right.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
So I mean well those see even with Sony though that tends to happen kind of like mid-cycle.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Nintendo's always done it very late.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
So this whole Wii mini it's not unheard of.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
It's like the DSi XL you know.

32:35.000 --> 32:43.000
It's weird that they're taking some of the features away but I guess if they want to get at that bargain basement price and you know maybe they're trying to see.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Maybe they think somebody who wants internet in their device ought to just get a Wii U.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
ActDeft asks does the mini come with Wii Sports though?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
No it comes with nothing.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Interesting.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
So remember none of the systems sell with Wii Sports anymore.

33:00.000 --> 33:07.000
They actually well I mean they have a bundle with one but they've got it being sold separately now for 20 bucks.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
How easy though is it to get like a copy of Wii Sports at GameStop for probably like five bucks.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Or EB Canada or whatever they have up there you know.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
So anyway.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah I mean obviously it's not something I would pick up anytime soon.

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
It's neat but I kind of want to see someone hack this apart you know to add all those features back in.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Well I mean you know an SD card slot might be kind of nice.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
But I mean if they had an SD card slot you could buy that and then.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
What would you use the SD card slot for when there's no internet?

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
You use it for loading the homebrew channel and then all the x-rays that go along with it.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Okay there you go.

33:44.000 --> 33:51.000
Alright VX Jason XV in our chat says the GameCube wasn't remodeled but there was the Panasonic Cube.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
I think that was only in Japan and again that wasn't a late cycle thing that was actually really early on wasn't it.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah Panasonic Cube was pretty early.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
So that was I always kind of wanted one of those.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Not anymore.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Expensive for just a DVD player.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
I remember seeing them in I think in Japantown in LA we would see them.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
They were like $700 or something crazy like that.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
So yeah I wasn't going to be getting one anytime soon.

34:15.000 --> 34:23.000
Alright moving on to a story about something that's been kind of controversial and on a lot of blogs and so forth this week.

34:23.000 --> 34:33.000
It is a new Humble Bundle but this one's got some people raising their eyebrows because it's the Humble THQ Bundle.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
So it's no longer the Humble Indie Bundle it's now selling THQ games.

34:39.000 --> 34:47.000
However there's still the charity you can split the money between THQ charity and the Humble Bundle website tip.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
You can give all your money to one or the other you know you can adjust the sliders just like any of the previous packs.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
It comes with the soundtracks for all the games as well.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Here's the other sticking point for a lot of people.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
These games are only available on Windows Steam.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And in Canada. I'm kidding.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
No don't start lies.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
No no no.

35:06.000 --> 35:14.000
But they're only available on Windows Steam because THQ has imported these games to Linux or things like that and I guess they don't have plans to.

35:14.000 --> 35:21.000
And the Steam part means there is DRM and the Humble Bundle usually doesn't have DRM.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.000
Usually you can get a Steam key to load the games in Steam which is what a lot of people do that's what I do.

35:27.000 --> 35:35.000
But you can also once you've bought a bundle you have a key that works forever that you can go into the site and just download the game on a whim.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
If I wanted to I could go to a friend's house download the game install it and you know it would never know.

35:41.000 --> 35:49.000
I mean with the Humble Bundle being open and pay what you want you're not supposed to really do that but if you want to it's there.

35:50.000 --> 36:01.000
But there's a lot of people that are I don't want to say they're saying that the Humble Bundle is selling out but I'm looking at a story on the Penny Arcade report that says it is a step backward.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
I don't get it.

36:04.000 --> 36:13.000
And it's not that like I have some I actually usually really respect in particular the Penny Arcade report and don't mishear me I'm not saying I don't respect him over this story.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
I mean we always are welcome to having difference of opinion this is why we you know have the internet in the first place.

36:18.000 --> 36:25.000
But I was I kind of had a little bit of a frown at this story because I was like this reads like gamer entitlement in a way to me.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
And I was really disappointed.

36:27.000 --> 36:34.000
Doesn't make any sense either because you would think that you know this is basically a way for the Humble Bundle guys to kind of get a little bit more traffic on their site.

36:34.000 --> 36:44.000
And if anything it's still more money being thrown at Child's Play Charities something I would think that Penny Arcade would be kind of okay for you know hey it's more donations for Child's Play potentially.

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
I mean granted it's okay some THQ games not necessarily indie games but they're not calling it an indie bundle they're calling it the THQ bundle.

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
They never said you know on the site that we're only going to do indie games they just this is what they've been offering so far.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Don't buy it if you don't like it.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
Again this is from the Penny Arcade report I'm going to read a little quote here quote.

37:07.000 --> 37:14.000
Indies have been replaced by a single big name studio DRM is back and the variety of platforms supported has been shrunk.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
This isn't a Humble Bundle it's a Steam Sale.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
No it's not a Steam Sale you can't donate all your money to a Steam Sale to charity.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
That's a huge difference a huge difference for a lot of people there.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You can't also pay what you want on a Steam Sale.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
That's right you still have to pay some sort of price there on a Steam Sale.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
I get the whole it stinks because they don't support all of the platforms.

37:37.000 --> 37:45.000
That's the part I'm kind of with them at but at the same token I'm like well this is better than nothing at all.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
And who said the Humble Bundle has to deliver something all the time.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
I see the Humble Bundle quite frankly as gifts to the industry.

37:53.000 --> 38:00.000
Pay what you want donate to charity lots of great games that's a freaking gift to the industry.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Why are we feeling entitled?

38:03.000 --> 38:14.000
That's bad that's really bad and it just made it kind of disappointed me that websites like this that I'm like 99% of the time like I'm with your brother.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
Went down this road Ars Technica another one that wrote a piece that was very critical of it and I read that side all the time.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
I think it's a great site.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Good for page hits.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I guess that's true.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says this isn't the EA Indie Bundle.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Ain't that the truth.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
That was a thing easy.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
You know making a joke there on something that was real very tongue in cheek there.

38:36.000 --> 38:46.000
I honestly I think that actually even though it's DRM and only limited platform.

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
As an experiment it's a good idea because I mean it's a way for a company to.

38:53.000 --> 39:02.000
I mean basically all these donations are tax write offs anyway whatever they don't make on whatever the retail price of the game is is going to count as a tax write off as a charitable donation.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
But it's a way to encourage people to give to those who need it.

39:09.000 --> 39:16.000
The story goes on to make a point about how the bundle will not help the people that actually made the games in this case.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
Because a lot of the THQ employees have been laid off since the time this bundle came out.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Or I mean since the time these games originally came out.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
And I'm kind of like alright I get that.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
That sucks but A THQ is kind of desperate right now.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
And for what I you know their stock is in the toilet that's no secret.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
We've had a lot of grim stories about them lately.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
My understanding is they went to the humble bundle with this idea.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
And I think with desperate times call for desperate measures.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
And you've got to do something radical to save your company.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Or there won't be any THQ games in the future.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
And I kind of I applaud the fact that they're taking a risk.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
And this is a risk around for everybody and I kind of wish more gaming companies would take risks.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
And it seems to be paying off what three million dollars raised not necessarily all for THQ.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
But you figure THQ even if they've got a half million of that.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
Has making way more money than they probably were off these games at this point anyway.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
And let's be honest I mean they have steam sales all the time.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
Like you know Saints Row the Third is always being marked down to like ten bucks fifteen bucks or whatever.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
That's kind of really what I wanted to buy it anyways.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
I mean yeah cool donate money to everything.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
But yeah I just wanted Saints Row the Third.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Six bucks is a pretty good price for Saints Row the Third.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
And I get Red Faction Armageddon which was awesome.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
And also you know Metro 2033.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
And the other games.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
And Darksiders.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
I mean that's just icing on the cake for me.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
So what?

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
I don't hate the fact that I got a good deal on those games.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
And the hate on steam for having steam sales in I guess.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
I mean I don't know why people were just hating on it at all.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
I gave well over the average actually.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
I give a bit over the average to get the pack just because I wanted to support it.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
I kind of wanted to offset some of the negativity I saw on the internet.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
And I donated the vast majority of it to charity.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I gave THQ a dollar and I gave a dollar for the tip.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
You know because you should always give a dollar to something you support.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
But I gave the rest to charity.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I gave it all to charity.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Well and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Also one more thing I want to read out of this story.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
And again I don't mean to be picking on this but this is just one of those things that I don't get it.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
Like I think this guy just had a moment of weakness or something or I don't know.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Again from the penny arcade report.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I'm going to be a hypocrite and buy a bundle.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
Just because these are incredible games at a staggering low price.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
But wouldn't it have been something if they were offered without DRM?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Or if they ran on Linux?

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
Or if the space was used to promote games that hadn't already sold millions of copies?

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Yeah that would have been something.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
But it is what it is.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
Steam doesn't always put the games I want on sale.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
Who's to say the humble bundle would have been something maybe I would have been interested in?

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Maybe it would have been another humble android bundle.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Something I can't get any use out of.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
You know?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
It is what it is.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
You buy some and you leave some on the table.

42:13.000 --> 42:20.000
Like that speaks to me a little bit like every bundle should be catered to what I want.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Well that doesn't sound entitled at all.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
By the way this is not the first time that Humble Bundle has done a bundle for one company.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
There was the Humble Frozenbyte Bundle which I bought some time ago.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Granted I know. Big difference.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Frozenbyte is an indie company. Very different type of thing.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But I just wanted to put that out there.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
It's not unheard of for the Humble Bundle to do a pack dedicated to one company.

42:43.000 --> 42:49.000
I think it's a great deal and I would encourage our listeners to check it out and support it.

42:49.000 --> 43:00.000
Humblebundle.com. One thing we will not do on this show is give away keys that we bought for 5 cents to the pack of games minus Saints Row the Third.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
I find that shit to be incredibly tacky.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
And if you're one of these podcasts that buys keys for I guess really it's a dollar.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
I shouldn't say a quarter because you have to give a dollar minimum.

43:11.000 --> 43:17.000
But if you're one of these podcasts that buys the keys for a dollar just to get your show some cheap promotion and give them away on your show.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
I'm calling you out. That's fucked up. You're missing the point.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
You're denying what potentially could be sales for charity.

43:26.000 --> 43:34.000
Now it's another thing if you gave $20 or $10 or more and maybe you're including the Saints Row the Third thing.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
Because then okay you're fronting that kind of money for somebody who may not have the money.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
But think about it. If you buy it for a dollar and then give it away on your show to somebody who maybe hadn't heard of it yet.

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
Who could have potentially spent $20 on the bundle but now won't because you gave them a key that you bought at bargain basement prices.

43:52.000 --> 43:59.000
You have robbed a charity of money for the sake of your own self-promotion. Don't do that.

43:59.000 --> 44:08.000
It is different if you buy the whole thing and go I'm not going to play this crap. No I'm kidding.

44:08.000 --> 44:14.000
Even then I mean I just I've seen. I'm giving them to Dan. There's a particular play.

44:14.000 --> 44:20.000
I saw a show doing it out there and I'm not going to say who that bought five out why not five codes.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
Well honestly I don't know the name of it because it was something I saw while I was Twitter bouncing.

44:24.000 --> 44:31.000
So I don't even remember the name of it but I just kind of I gave it so much stink eye. I'm like oh that's frustrating.

44:31.000 --> 44:41.000
Like stop it. All right. Let's see. Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

44:41.000 --> 44:50.000
Brad from Pod Culture says I always donate 100% to charity. I'm usually not a fan as of much as the gamers but they make a great perk for your donation.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
I think he means like kind of like the games. So let's see.

44:55.000 --> 45:02.000
Actdeft in chat says Darksiders is very well worth this bundle and you can give the Saints Row the third code to anyone you want.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
So you know you know and I see friends kind of code so that's different.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
Again friends now that's very very very different because friends aren't doing it for their own self-promotion.

45:11.000 --> 45:22.000
So all right. Let's move on. I don't want to focus on the negative but you know when something makes me irritated I'm going to say something about it.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
I am being a concerned parent right now as the show has been along for far too long. All right. Dark Sakura.

45:28.000 --> 45:36.000
Well how about something having to do with an old idea from Sony coming back to bite them in the ass.

45:36.000 --> 45:47.000
Well at least in theory. In 2008 they had patented a break apart PS3 controller and nothing happened with it.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
And it's also not you know the huge space boomerang that was there at E3.

45:52.000 --> 46:08.000
Well now they're revisiting the idea with a new patent that I mean it even has it down to the circuit boards and everything and two different versions of it with a regular PlayStation controller with little move bubbles on it which I don't get but OK.

46:08.000 --> 46:20.000
And then also it has regular PlayStation handles like controller handles and then really long ones like extra grips.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
I guess if you're doing move stuff with it so it almost seems to me like they're doing a two handed move controller.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
You know if I was going to design a controller I'd just make a new negcon.

46:32.000 --> 46:39.000
I do like the idea of there being a controller that kind of snaps apart and becomes the move. That's actually kind of rad.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
It looks completely dumb.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
If they build it right.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
It was better designed.

46:45.000 --> 46:54.000
Yeah I mean but Sony is not a stranger to going back and redesigning shit that gets received poorly. Remember the boomerang controller everybody.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
At least that's what I said earlier it's not the space boomerang.

46:57.000 --> 47:05.000
Yeah so at least it's not that what do you think Loki about a controller that can break apart and come together and all this looks dumb.

47:05.000 --> 47:14.000
It looks dumb only because you know a lot of people aren't interested in the move it's not like oh we need to sell more of these move controllers.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
I just I don't think the the thing that's keeping people out of the move is not the price point of their controllers.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
It's that no one wants to play those games which is sad because it's a good controller.

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
It's a it's actually pretty good. To be honest it I think works better than the Kinect.

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
And that's that that's the tragic thing is that in a way the move is really the best motion thing out of all of them.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
But nobody seems to care.

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah and there's even some games out there I can't remember the one there's some download title that just came out.

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
It's where you splashing paint with the controllers and like unfinished one.

47:54.000 --> 48:02.000
That's it unfinished one. And I'm hearing raves about I haven't played it myself yet because I don't have a move although I hear I just found out like the other day you can do it with controllers.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
So I need to check it out but I'm hearing raves about that game.

48:06.000 --> 48:17.000
And in general the PlayStation Network in general like there's been a lot of great shit on that between Journey which you know is competing for Game of the Year for a reason in a lot of places.

48:17.000 --> 48:29.000
And you know the unfinished swan and some of these other games like there's so much great shit on PlayStation that like is not getting noticed like Sony has a marketing problem big time.

48:29.000 --> 48:36.000
And it's part of the reason why the move isn't really selling either. I think there is more to the move than the Kinect in many ways.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
I mean granted the move isn't moving the Kinect has Dance Central which is you know always going to be a fave of mine.

48:41.000 --> 48:49.000
But you know it doesn't it doesn't go much past the dancing games for me. But at least the move has some other interesting things.

48:49.000 --> 48:59.000
So let's see Tiger Claw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says here's the question what if you lose half of that break apart controller.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
You wouldn't be able to play with it because the half that's the analog stick and the D pad is missing.

49:04.000 --> 49:11.000
Well if you think about it what's the Wii U controller and the nunchuck. That was kind of a break away controller of sorts too.

49:11.000 --> 49:19.000
And a lot of times that kind of stood in for your typical controller was the nunchuck and the Wii pad.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
And if you lost the nunchuck then stupid you shouldn't have lost it. It was kind of that same thing.

49:24.000 --> 49:33.000
Cram in our chat room says a boomerang controller would be perfect for all those rage induced controller throws.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
That is true. The PlayStation was the first console to get well Demon Souls was the first game.

49:40.000 --> 49:48.000
Let's see SSG100Matt says I like the boomerang. Some people some people liked it.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
Well I'll see how much you like it when it comes around to hit you in the head.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
I don't think it was an actual boomerang. I think the buttons cut out some of the arrow.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
I bet you anything that if they had marketed that way then someone would have found a way to make it work.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Alright let's move on with some more news.

50:05.000 --> 50:12.000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about Timesplitters. One of my favorite first person shooter series.

50:12.000 --> 50:20.000
And really we need a new game. It's been like a long time. PlayStation 2 since Future Perfect.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
So now Timesplitters 4 that's been in talks for a while. Back when Free Radical was doing it.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
And then it was supposed to be being worked on by Crytek and stuff.

50:31.000 --> 50:40.000
Well unfortunately the reason it hasn't kind of come out yet is because they haven't been able to find a publisher to actually put it out.

50:40.000 --> 50:46.000
And it kind of sucks because Free Radical's last game Haze was kind of crap.

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
And I think Timesplitters 4 would actually be a really great game.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
They say that it was in very early stages of development when Free Radical went into administration.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
And they even had a small playable demo that was shown to several publishers.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
But it didn't attract enough of any publishing deals.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
And they're also saying that the marketing person. Or actually they're saying. Let's see here.

51:12.000 --> 51:18.000
Secondly the marketing person would say something along the lines of I don't know how to sell this.

51:18.000 --> 51:26.000
And then the unanimous opinion among all publishers were that they pitched Timesplitters 4.

51:26.000 --> 51:32.000
Or I guess it's a game you can't market because it's too diverse a set of characters.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
Yeah it is kind of hard to explain a game that features exploding monkeys and cats with wheels on them that you race.

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
But at the same time though look at Saints Row the Third. Perfect example.

51:43.000 --> 51:52.000
Granted that is a little bit more linear but you've got you know a thing from this crazy Japanese cat character to hitting people with giant purple cocks.

51:52.000 --> 51:59.000
So if they can market giant cocks all the time just saying I honestly think I think the game markets itself.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
You just show this crazy shit and people like cats with wheels. Fuck yes. Sign me up.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
Or I'm playing a game where I'm shooting people in duck costumes.

52:07.000 --> 52:15.000
It's part of part of the reason we got behind President Cat all those years ago is it was something different crazy and seriously just put the game out.

52:15.000 --> 52:25.000
It's going to be by understanding that everyone wants to play it really safe because you know new IPs kind of don't do well but take a risk.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
You have to take risks to succeed. We just talked about. Here's how you do it.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
You just you put out the HD version of you know the old PlayStation 2 games because you've got three of them.

52:34.000 --> 52:42.000
You can do an HD trilogy which people are trying to get a petition going and actually has a lot of signatures on to get that to happen.

52:42.000 --> 52:51.000
Then based on the response from that how well that sells then you go decide OK should we move forward with you know putting this out as you know times players for.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
I think it would do well. I think I mean if they put out an HD version of these games I would buy an RP.

52:56.000 --> 53:03.000
It's easy. I mean times where it seriously was a great game. It was one of those games that I actually bought one of the.

53:03.000 --> 53:12.000
I forget what the hell they called it but like a multi tap but is basically you know maybe it was all these up you know the four player add on for the PS 2.

53:12.000 --> 53:19.000
I bought that for time splitters too. And it was fantastic fun. So I just hope they do it.

53:19.000 --> 53:27.000
Somebody put it out or hey you know what free radical I mean or X free radical because I think they're gone.

53:27.000 --> 53:39.000
There's all I mean if they have the IP which I don't know who had owns IP right now but if they have the IP there's always Kickstarter and I guarantee that shit we get kick started no problem.

53:39.000 --> 53:45.000
All right well speaking of bad management decisions Sega has been pulling some crazy shit on YouTube.

53:45.000 --> 53:53.000
They are shutting down channels or I should say excuse me shutting down the videos which could lead to a channel shut down if it happens too many times.

53:53.000 --> 54:00.000
Of any type of uploaded video of the Sega Saturn RPG shining force 3.

54:00.000 --> 54:09.000
Now it's weird because you know it's not like shining force 3 is this brand it's not an episode of the walking dead that somebody's posting to YouTube.

54:09.000 --> 54:20.000
You know it's something that's years old so the question is why now. Well there is a new PSP installment called shining arc that is coming out in Japan in February.

54:20.000 --> 54:29.000
Okay so maybe they don't want people searching YouTube to get confused but doesn't that seem a little bit throwing the baby out with the bathwater to somebody.

54:30.000 --> 54:43.000
Here's the other crazy thing. Not only were let's play videos thrown out walkthroughs random gameplay clip clips fans talking about shining force were shut down.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
How is that even possible.

54:46.000 --> 54:57.000
Well okay here's how it's possible because Sega is a YouTube partner. They get the little button that allows them to take down you know basically a content thing.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
No questions asked the content provider has only 24 hours to appeal it that.

55:03.000 --> 55:16.000
NBC has these buttons too and so forth and this is what led the internet to rage against Pippa and SOPA and all that stuff because it would have given the government one of these buttons.

55:16.000 --> 55:25.000
And you know it would have been open season on not just YouTube. Now granted YouTube has the right to do whatever they want on their turf.

55:25.000 --> 55:35.000
You can't claim this is a freedom of speech thing. There would be nothing stopping you from going to Vimeo or whatever unless Sega decides to crack down there too or whatever other site you want to do.

55:35.000 --> 55:43.000
But this just seems like a crappy decision on Sega's part especially if this is something to do with shining arc.

55:43.000 --> 55:48.000
A game that's not even going to come out in the US or you know so we think so far.

55:48.000 --> 55:58.000
I mean so you're going to shut down all the fan channels of this niche game from many years ago to promote your new game. Why?

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
You're just going to ruffle the feathers of the people that will most likely be buying your game.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Why wouldn't you want some of the publicity out there and so forth?

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
AcidicVampire wants to know yeah OLR will this be bleeped on the downloaded podcast?

56:12.000 --> 56:19.000
No because this podcast isn't a part of YouTube. It's part of VOG Network. We don't have an agreement with Sega.

56:19.000 --> 56:27.000
And that is where the government does allow me to say what I want for the purposes of critique.

56:27.000 --> 56:36.000
I wouldn't slander Shining Force or slander Sega or so what but I'm entitled to my opinion and my opinion is this is bullshit.

56:36.000 --> 56:44.000
And you can't sue me for that. I'm entitled to my opinion. I'm saying it on my own show that I pay for with my own money for the network and so forth and all that.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
That's freedom of speech.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
And freedom of the press.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
Exactly.

56:49.000 --> 56:57.000
So there you go. No I know AcidicVampire was teasing but I did want to make that point. He says I was teasing.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Wise.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
So.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
Yeah a cram in the chat says too. Now Sega is going to shut down OLR for mentioning Shining Force.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
Oh and how about this. Fantasy Star. How about some Fantasy Star Rob.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
I would play.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Oppa Oppa.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
I would play some music from Shining Force but I can't because all the YouTubes have been shut down.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Do I happen to have any in my collection?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I've got soundtracks at home.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
I might. You never know.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
And there's also the soundcloud.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Look what I have. Look what I have.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Oh see.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Look what I have.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Look what I have.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Let's play it.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
Alright everybody it's the totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Play that with mailbag.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Play that with mailbag.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
No because I think technically you're only allowed to use 30 seconds for the purposes of 15.

57:54.000 --> 58:01.000
As I found out when doing the intro to another show, it's 10% of the song up to 30 seconds.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
Well we'll cut it off at 23 seconds. There you go.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
So that song sucked.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
Just kidding. I don't really think that but I actually like Shining Force. That's the sad thing about it.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
Totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
I have like a bunch of the old Shining Force games.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
AcidicVampire in chat says, I'm witnessing illegal behavior. Oh my.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Frisbee in chat says, Orange Pirate Radio.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
There you go. Alright.

58:35.000 --> 58:41.000
SSG100Matt says, No no no it's only Shining Force 3 guys. Shining Force 1 and 2 don't count.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Oh well.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
Alright anyhow. That was Shining Force Medley by the way.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
Let's move on to more news.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
DarkSagra.

58:52.000 --> 59:01.000
Well, for anyone who is a fan of The Walking Dead, as we know who was, you know, not listening to Bobby's show and was watching The Walking Dead.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Or reading books.

59:02.000 --> 59:09.000
Um, The Walking Dead Assault is going to be on iOS and it will be an isometric strategy game.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
Which, I mean, guarantees I won't be playing it because I hate those kinds of games.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
However, it's a pretty neat looking game.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
It's, you know, mostly looks black and white with a few blue elements.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
And some blood splatter.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Oh, there's some green in here.

59:25.000 --> 59:31.000
So yeah, it looks like it's mostly black and white with some overlay of various bright colors as effects.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
But it's, I don't know, it looks kind of neat.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
But it's supposed to be episodic like the Telltale series.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
And it's going to follow a new cast.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
And it's going to be based more on the comic.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Quit promoting the competition. Geez.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
No, I'm just kidding.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Get it because the show is on?

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I hear the game is very, very good.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
That's on my list of things I need to finish this holiday season is The Walking Dead games.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Even though I've never watched the show.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But it doesn't matter because the games are based on the books.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It's the one common misconception people make.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and look at some games that are coming out very, very soon.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Yes, this week we've got Far Cry 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PC.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
A few games coming out on the Wii, Rise of the Guardians.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Because it was a little bit delayed from the other launch.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Family Party, 30 Great Games Obstacle Arcade on the Wii, only for 30 bucks.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC, Rapalas Probe, Bass Fishing, 2012 on the Wii U.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Cavella's Dangerous Hunts, 2013 on the Wii U.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on the Wii U.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Guardians of Middle Earth on PlayStation 3.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Fun little voucher there.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I like buying digital games in a package.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Resistance Collection on the PS3.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And what else here?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Oh, the Mass Effect trilogy on PS3 finally coming out.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Already preordered.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You are such a consumer whore.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
You would have done it too.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
You know what? No, I wouldn't have because I play on PC.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Whatever.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Also...

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I hope the PlayStation 3 version has an extra scene with Garrus.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Just to make you mad.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And yeah, that's actually it for this week.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Almost to the end of games for this year because we only got a couple more weeks before.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
It's all kind of crap coming out next, but that's it.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Alright, well let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's a little bit of a different story. It's a busy week in Japan.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
On the Xbox 360, Saints Row the Third, the full package.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I'm assuming that is like the version that has all the DLC and whatever is out in Japan this week.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
On the PlayStation 3, a couple price reductions for Biohazard Revival Selection.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Resident Evil.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Devil May Cry HD Collection, probably because of the new one.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
A new slim console that's Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Emblem Edition.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Because Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Yume Kanaishi Mono comes out this week from Sega.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And that is on the PlayStation 3.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And going to the Vita, nothing this week, but Spy Hunter coming out in Japan next week.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I didn't even know that was still a thing that was going on.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
On the 3DS this week in Japan, Paper Mario Super Seal.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I'm hearing good things about that, by the way, here in the States.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That's one I haven't looked at, but yeah.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari 2.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Like, what is that? That has nothing to do, like, it's not Pikachu.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's just Pika Pika...

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I don't know what this is.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It's cute!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
What is she doing? She's like measuring crack on that little scale.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Well, that seems like it's pretty self-explanatory.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I think it's a vet hospital game, actually, judging from the pets on the calendars.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I think it's like a pet hospital game.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Maybe.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
She's a pet pharmacist.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Taikaizoku to Shippuden on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
But it doesn't end there.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Know why?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Because the Wii U launches on December 8th.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
That is before our next show.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Oh, stop it.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The Wii U is great.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And we'll be launching in Japan.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Of course, just like they did here with the black version and the white version.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
There's also a set they're going to be launching over there.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The Monster Hunter 3G HD Premium set.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Because one of their huge launch games is Monster Hunter 3G HD version.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
That is a game that is launching with the console over there.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Otherwise, other games launching in Japan this week for the Wii U.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Assassin's Creed 3.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Batman Arkham City Armored Edition.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
FIFA 13 World Class Soccer.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Mass Effect 3 Special Edition.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Musou Orochi 2 Hyper.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
New Super Mario Bros. U.

Nintendo Land.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And I think that's it.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Zombie U.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Rounding out the launch games over there in Japan.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
That does it for Japanese release dates.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
On the 4th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
On the 5th, Guardians of Middle Earth and The Critter Chronicles.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
That's just a cute name.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
On the 7th, we have Air Conflict Specific Carriers.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Mass Effect Trilogy Edition for PS3.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And Paper Mario Sticker Star.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The end.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
The end, Rob.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Forever. No, I'm kidding.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
No, we still have two more shows before that.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Damn it. Okay.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
By the way, speaking of all that,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Hubbaloo and chat about the world ending on the 21st.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Did you know NASA has an official section on their website

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
dedicated to why that whole thing is a farce?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And like, the world is not even...

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
But I was reading this fascinating story on Google about how like,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
like a lot of us kind of are treating it as a joke at this point.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Like, yeah, okay, the world's ending again.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Because we all went through this, what, just six months ago

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
when that wacko out of the East Bay was talking about, you know,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
May whatever's Judgment Day, the rapture and all that.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
But like, some people get seriously emotionally disturbed by this stuff.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And I mean, it makes sense.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Especially like, younger people really thinking like,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
the world is gonna end and they get really like, depressed over it.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And like, you know, I don't mean to make light of it.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Like, it's actually really sad.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But it makes me just kind of think like, oh, we shouldn't,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
shouldn't perpetuate that kind of crap.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Because some people really take it like, too far.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Like, they're just convinced.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Even though NASA has come out and said,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
look, there is no meteor headed towards Earth.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
If there was, you could see it in the sky by now.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It is not like, like, he's a black meteor.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
You can't see black on black.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Even in Majora's Mask, people, you could see the thing getting bigger

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
as it was coming towards Hyrule.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
That would be ironic if it was the meteor with the face on it.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
A couple more news stories for you guys.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And then the classic game of the week.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But first, Loki.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So this is kind of cool.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You know, if you happen to invest in one of the Raspberry Pis,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
the little pocket sized computer that's like, 35 bucks.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You're gonna have a new game that you may be able to run on pretty soon.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
They're gonna be doing a Pi edition of Minecraft.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It's gonna be kind of similar to like, the Pocket edition.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Definitely scaled down to run on, you know, such a small computer.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
With limited processing power.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But pretty awesome.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And it's gonna be free.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So, um, looking forward to that.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I actually kind of want to get one of these.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
They have a huge waiting list.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Or at least they did have a huge waiting list.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You know, to be able to buy one.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And I just, at the time I'm like, what the hell am I gonna do with this?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
But I still kind of want one.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Because it's kind of fun to, you know, mess with.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It's a $35 computer.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
And now it plays Minecraft.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So that's even better.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Is Minecraft gonna be an Ouya thing?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Not to derail too much.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Speaking of cheap.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Well, here's the thing.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Minecraft is already on Android.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And granted, Ouya is gonna be supporting stuff through their marketplace.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But I would think that it would be able to run.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Depending on how they have the buttons mapped for the controllers.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
If it runs like any of those Bluetooth gamepads.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I mean, if you remember, there was a version that was on the Xperia Play.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Which is an Android device.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And, you know, that ran with controller support.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So technically maybe the Pocket Edition would be supported.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I would hope that they would have their own version for it.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
But I don't think it's gonna be something you see at launch.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I mean, it's gonna be something that they'd have to, like, adapt to it.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Or get, you know, some sort of, you know, not just have to see how popular it is.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And then decide to port it over.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
But, you know, who's to say?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It might, you know, run other games that are not, you know, officially supported by Ouya.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And it just may run.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
So, hopefully.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Alright, well, Dark Sakura, I don't think I've ever seen one of these in your vault.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
But, uh, a Vectrex. Do you have one of these in the vault?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The Vectrex?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
No.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
No? You should get one. They're pretty neat.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Even though they were kind of a very, very niche thing.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And if you don't know what this is, vector gaming was really big in the 80s.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
We almost had one.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yeah?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yeah.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
What stopped you?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And they were like, wait, it's a Vectrex.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Well, uh, vector gaming was kind of all the rage for a while there.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Probably the most well-known vector game would probably be what?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Tempest?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Actually, Star Wars.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Yeah.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Remember, the original Star Wars was a vector game.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
But vector games were also super big on the Atari systems, too.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
That's true. That's true.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Well, a whole system came out dedicated to vector-based games.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I had one for a while.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Did you really? I remember that. I do.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And they were like little tabletop units.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Yeah.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Right? And they had a game built in.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Mindstorm was the built-in game, which was basically Asteroids, but like, you know, that type of thing.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
But they did release other games to the Vectrex.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Well, the Vectrex is coming back of sorts.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
It's a release called Vectrex Regeneration.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
It is on the iOS platforms, meaning iPad and iPhone, of course.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It's free.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
So if you want to check it out, it does come with Mindstorm for free.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And you can check it out.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And I got to say, I was checking it out a little bit before the show.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And it's a pretty, you know, for these retro collections, they didn't do a shitty job of it.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
You know, because sometimes you see these retro collections, they're kind of hack jobs, like they're not very good.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
But they actually, you know, put in little achievement systems.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
They have a little cork board in there that you can have your little achievements on.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And they have the box arts, the original one that you can fully rotate and, you know, look at.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
They did a pretty good job.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So, you know, hey, it's free. Why not check it out?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And you can play Mindstorm.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Now, of course, if you want more, 18 other titles from the Vectrex's collection are available for $6.99.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Not a bad deal.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
That also comes with iCade support.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I find that interesting that they're paywalling that.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Almost got an iCade.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Yeah?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
But still 100 bucks.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Like I said earlier, I still kind of want one.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I won't win two.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Even though it is 100 bucks, I do still kind of want one.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Because I just, can you imagine me just plopping it there on the table?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Do you know what we found, by the way?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000
We found a little, I think it's like a NES controller thing that hooks onto Android phones.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Oh, that's cool.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Or like a special type of controller attachment.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
But it was kind of neat.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
But it was much cheaper.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
All 29 games ever released for the system will be added at some point as in-app purchases.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
What is missing from the app?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Actual plastic screen covers.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Like you had on the, do you remember you had to take these little screen covers?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
You know what was missing on my Vectrex?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Actual plastic screen covers.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Oh, yeah.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
You didn't have those?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
No.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I mean, you can play Mindstorm without one, but...

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
You can play all of them without them.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I mean, I'm sure that the games have like some sort of overlay.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Oh, no, no.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Yeah.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Of course.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Yeah.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
In the app, obviously.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
How hard is it with modern technology?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Just draw the plastic on top of it.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But it still looked kind of neat.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I like that.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So check that out.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Just search for Vectrex in the app store.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
V-E-C-T-R-E-X.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
A little shout-out for those guys at Rant Media Games who've made that.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
All right.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Let's, hey, what a great lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the vault, so you know it won't be a Vectrex game.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But she's going to pick a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be playing this game.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You better recognize.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
How about you better recognize her?

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Ooh, is it Tron?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Did you pick Tron as the Classic Game of the Week?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
No, I didn't.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Oh.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Dan picks the game again.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Again?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Yeah, but I have a reason for this one.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
All right.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
What is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
The Golden Axe.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I have not done Golden Axe.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Wow.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I should have done Shining Force.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
You really should have, but that's okay.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
All right.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So Golden Axe is the Classic Game of the Week.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Oh, man, Rob, your contrast is like way crazy on your computer.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I'm sorry.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
We've all had those.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Stop the stupid ads.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I know.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That's all right.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.000
But Golden Axe is a game that was primarily developed by Makoto Uchida.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And it's a side-scrolling hack and slash video game.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Pow!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Done in 1989 for the, um, actually System 16B arcade hardware.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And, of course, it came out on the Genesis and Master System much later.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It's sort of a Conan the Barbarian type of game.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
The high fantasy medieval world.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And you play as one of three characters who are getting revenge on Death Adder.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
What a great name.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Of course, I always laugh at the later ones because we have Death Adder Jr.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That just makes me laugh.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Hi, I'm going to name you Death Adder Jr.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Um, so you...

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Why not?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
If I have a kid, I think Rob Roberts Jr. would be a great name.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Don't you?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I thought you had a different one in mind.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yeah, but we can't get into it.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I know.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I'm not saying it.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Um, anyway, the first character you have is a dwarf that wields a battle axe called Gilius Thunderhead.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Which is just an awesome name.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And it's a golden axe.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Yes, but the actual golden axe is in the possession of Death Adder.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
What?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Who tries to use it to kill you to death.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Um, there's also a male barbarian.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And, Rob, this is an even better name.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Um, the guy's name is Axe Battler.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Yeah, Axe Battler.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
It just sounds to me like it would be, you know, um, something from like a re-dubbed anime.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
That was like, sort of like, you know, Voltron or something.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Um, and then you, uh, have, he uses a broadsword by the way.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And he's trying to avenge the murder of his mother.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And Gilius is trying to avenge the death of his brother.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And then you have the redhead lady, uh, Tyrus Flare.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Who is an Amazon.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And her parents were killed by Death Adder.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Death Adder is a bastard.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
He's just a dirty bitch.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Um, so anyway, they, uh, go to rescue everyone from Turtle Village.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Which actually turns out to be on a turtle.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And the turtle takes them across the sea.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And then they go to the castle in the back of a giant eagle.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And then they beat Death Adder to death.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You know, how ironic.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And it turns out his daddy, Deathbringer, is the real final boss in the Genesis version.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And then they get the golden axe and they're immortal like forever.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
So, um, it's, you've got like different, um, capabilities with them.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000
For example, the dwarf is strongest on weapon but weakest on, um, spell power.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Where the, uh, Amazon is strongest on spell power but weakest on sword power.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And then the regular, you know, dude's like, look at my chest.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And he's all average.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Oh, I love the artwork for this because it looks like seriously something straight off of a D&D cover.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Um, but anyway, um, the, uh, the producer was super, you know, fond of the action movies.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Especially the Conan ones.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
So that's why he, uh, you know, basically made the game in this theme.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And there's all kinds of other versions of it.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
There was the Mega Drive slash Genesis version that was very faithful to the arcade version.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
With an extra level of place you can kill Death Adder's daddy.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And we've got the, uh...

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
This is my favorite part, kicking the shit out of those little gnomes that had the potions.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Yeah.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Sorry.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And then, um...

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000
There was, uh, the, uh, Sega CD one that was a Sega Classics arcade that had Redbook audio music and voiceovers.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Um, there was a virtual console version.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
There was the Sega Smash Pack, the Genesis Collection, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Um, there's a version on PlayStation Plus for free.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Um, there were also PC versions that came out that had a 256 color palette in VGA mode.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And it could run it in EGA mode as well.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And a CGA and 2 color mode.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Which, why would you want to play it in 2 color?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
You haven't lived until you've played Golden Axe in CGA.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Anyway.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
But which color palette was it?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Was it the...

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I'm pretty sure it was the CMYK.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Not the RGB, yeah.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Which is very funny since, um, monitors are built for RGB.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Actually, whoops, I'm sorry.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
No, the other palette wasn't RGB, it was RGY.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Blue was only in the CMYK palette.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
CMY.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
No, it wasn't even CMY.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
God, I can't get it right.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
CMYK is for print only.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
No, it was, it was, it was not, it was white.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Not black.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Yes.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Syma, Genta, uh, white and black.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And then the other one was...

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
The CMWK?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Uh, red, green, yellow, and black.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Yeah, that was it.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Okay.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Anyway.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Thank you for the history lesson.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Color theory.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Mr. Loki.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000
The ZX Spectrum, um, and the Commodore 64 versions also were rather limited.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Um, there, like I said, there were different things added.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
The Master System version, um, retold the story from the perspective of the Axe Battler

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
who was called Tarek in that game.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And it's only one player.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Um, Golden Axe was also released by, um, Telnet for the PC Engine.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And it was, like, super resampled music, cut scenes, you name it.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
It's a very, very freaking good version of that game.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Um.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Sorry for the, uh, cut fact that the music cut out, but I, I'm trying to find a YouTube

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:44.000
clip of Golden Axe CGA, because I found a YouTube clip of 39 DOS retro games in CGA.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Dude.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I saw the Deanna Jones.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I didn't even know they had DuckTales in CGA.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Dude, dude.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Oh, God, it was purple.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Well, I will continue while Rob's looking for that.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Um, there was also a handheld TV game of the arcade legend Sega Genesis Volume 1, and an

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
enhanced remake that came out on PS2 as part of the Sega Ages line, which we came close

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
to getting.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Was the skater die guy supposed to be Rodney Dangerfield?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Because I swear to God.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I swear to God it's Rodney Dangerfield.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
No respect.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Alright, never mind.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Okay.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to derail with another game, but it was an important question that

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
had to be asked.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I will give you, um.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You found it?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Here's the answer.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It is the, it is the red, green, yellow, black palette.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
There is Golden Axe.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It doesn't look too terrible for what it is.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
In all your studying.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Oh, that's not the actual audio.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
That's just from the video.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But there is Golden Axe.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I was gonna say, that actually looks, that doesn't look that bad.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Yeah.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
They did some pretty crazy shit with four colors back in the day.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Damn.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You should see strip poker CGA.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I have.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Oh, Lord.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Of course you have.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Well, here's a little factoid with my history with this game.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The second game I ever played on the Sega Saturn, Rob, was Golden Axe, the duel.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Wow.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You know, the first game I played was?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It's a crappy Gundam game that came out, my friend imported.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So, anyway.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
There you go.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Best classic game.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Golden Axe.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Awesome.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Pow.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Sorry, now I'm looking up.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Oh my God.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Rob.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It's strip poker on the Commodore 64.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Oh my God, Rob.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
You need to put that porn away.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Some of those strip poker games may have for shareware.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Oh my God.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Somebody should flag this video for being disgusting.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Hey, I see some bush.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Exactly.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Four colors.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I mean, serious.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Oh, the 80s.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I don't know why it's so funny.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Oh, I know exactly why it's so funny.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Rob, do you find pubes really funny?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Well, no, I'm laughing because it just happened to be at the moment I was looking at the video,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
it said, my hand, because, you know, as in a poker reference, but then I'm like, her

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
hand looks like it's in her butt.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
She's getting herself ready.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You shouldn't be calling it.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
In fact, I will actually post that and see.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Alpha Kinanogram is demanding links.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
There you go in the chat room.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
There you go.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Strip poker.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Since we're on the illegal episode of Orange on the Radio.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Strip poker in all its Commodore 64 glory.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
We'll share porn with the kids too.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Sorry, I'm also asking Rama to tumble this with a parental advisory.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Good Lord.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
All right.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Here we go.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Moving on.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
That's it for part A.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
We need to take a break and clean up our act.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It's a very dirty illegal show tonight, but there's plenty more to come in part B.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
We've got more Wii U to talk about.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
We're going to talk about sales figures over Black Light Friday, Black Friday, and more

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
news on Ouya and some Nintendo rumors when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:57.000
right after this.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Live on this December the 2nd of 2012 with the 484th episode of our podcast.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
We're going to hit 500 early next year.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Can you believe it?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
We need to plan something special, like for real this time.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Like even bigger than our 10th anniversary show, which was just like people visiting

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
from far away coming to see the show.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
We need to plan something huge for our 500th episode.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I don't know what, but something that can be done on a very low budget.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
We'll have to throw ourselves a party at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
That's about what can fit in the budget.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
How will THQ bundle scene codes for everyone?

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Resell keys to the bundle.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
No, that's terrible.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
That's awful.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
How dare you even suggest that?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
We'll figure something out.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
OLR Kickstarter for OLR Con.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
No, I don't know.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I guess it would be more appropriate to have the party at Roseville Golf Land.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Did you know that the other night, um, you know, Saturday night was kind of a blood day,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
but there was a break in the storms and Alan and I were kind of going,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
what should we do?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Should we even go do something?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
What do you want to do?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And it was actually suggested, should we go to Roseville Golf Land?

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And we were like, what would we do?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
We're going to drive all the way out there and play what?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Like there's not that many great arcade games anymore.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I guess we could have driven to that bowling alley in Rockland.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
That's got some stuff.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I like them, but

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Blood strikes or whatever it's called.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
At least the last time I was there, they had some interesting things, but whatever.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Uh, all right.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
We'll figure something out.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Uh, yep.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But no breaks in the near future coming.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
As far as we know, we're going to keep doing an episode every week on into 2013.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Assuming, of course, the world does not end in a couple of weeks,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
although we all know it won't.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Come on.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
The media needs something to report on.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Loki.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
All right.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
So let's talk about something I mentioned during my gaming week,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
which is Skrillex.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Skrillex?

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Crest.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I swear, that's like a tongue twister for me.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
It's basically kind of a combination of a bunch of different things.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Retro, like NES games.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Because the whole thing, the premise of it is that there's this piece of dust

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
that falls onto an NES cartridge,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
and it's what happens when that dust corrupts everything in the game.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And so you're completing this, uh, link type character

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
that's kind of done in this, you know, sword and sorcery type art.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And you're fighting glitches that are in the game

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
and trying to save this sort of princess thing.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And it's pretty cool.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It's a free game.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
You can check it out on their website.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Which, let's see here.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I don't remember the hell it is.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
But, um, it's pretty cool.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
It's done by, like I said, the guy that did the Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now game,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
the Perfect Strangers one, Jason Oda.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
He kind of specializes in Adver games.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And, yes, so check this out.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
It's SkrillexQuest.com.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
It's pretty easy to find that.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Another kind of indie game that's getting a really unasked for sequel,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
uh, Barclay's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000
is getting the sequel entitled The Magical Realms of Tirnaa Nog,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of C'thulun,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
and the official game of the movie,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
chapter two of the Hoops Barclay saga,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
or Barclay 2 for short.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
It's being Kickstarted right now.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
And to be honest, I mean, I remember seeing some of the stuff

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
for Barclay's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
and this looks nothing like it.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
It just looks like kind of this weird cyberpunk game.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Um, and they're looking for $35,000 on Kickstarter,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
and some of the bonuses include all sorts of weird things,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
including a cyberdwarf body pillow,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and of course, you know, game downloads, soundtrack, and that kind of stuff.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
So that's interesting.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
And then last but not least, Dishonored doing pretty well in retail market.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Their sales have exceeded the expectations of Bethesda,

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
so I guess that means we're going to see another series of games,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
or another franchise from Bethesda, which is fine.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I think it was a pretty awesome game.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Apparently, it sold 460,000 copies in North America during October.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And of course, the sales figures, I think, for November,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
obviously haven't been released yet, because we just got into December.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So we'll have to see what it did, you know,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
competing up against Assassin's Creed and...

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Well, actually, I guess we saw a little bit of Assassin's Creed sales in there,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.000
but, you know, more Assassin's Creed 3 sales in Halo 4 and Black Ops 2.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Yeah.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
All right, well, moving on to a game I talked about last week,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
It's going to be a game that's going to get a patch on the Wii U.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
The Wii U version of the game is borked right now.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
You'll know that if you've tried to beat the boost challenge.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
It is pretty much impossible to beat.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I guess if you're, like, superhuman, you can beat it.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
But, yeah, some boost pads that are supposed to be there,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
that are there in the other versions of the game, not there.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
No wonder I couldn't beat it when I played it.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I was like, this is too hard.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And I thought maybe I needed to do more drifting to get those boosts,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
but I guess there really was a bug.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So the patch has already been sent to Nintendo for review.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
So I'm assuming that means it will be out very soon.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
You just weren't snaking enough.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I guess not, which, technically, I don't know if that's something you can do.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I mean, you can't do it to the level.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You can do it in Mario Kart, but it's possible.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Also, speaking of Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
there is going to be DLC for the game at some point,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
especially, we know, on 360 and PlayStation 3 versus the game.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
But folks in the community were throwing out ideas for DLC,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and executive producer Steve Lysett with Sumo Digital,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
who made the game, put out a challenge.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Quote, without any policing from the Sumo or Sega crew,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
if you can all agree on three characters by the first of December

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.000
and prove there is sufficient interest of at least 1,000 unique people per character,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I will present the result to Sega, the fans delivered,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
separate change.org petitions for the following characters

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
for these three current leaders.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Hatsune Miku, Project D.Va, that's a great choice.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Ryo Hazuki, from Shenmue, no surprise there.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Segata Sanshiro, the Sega Saturn mascot, if you weren't already aware.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
No guarantees that those three characters will be included,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
but those are some pretty bitchin' choices.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I hope that they do include Ryo, that they include him driving a forklift.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I hope when he takes somebody out, he'll be,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
there's your game of Lucky Hit, asshole.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Moving on to some other...

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I want to see, like, Echo the Dolphin or something like that.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Some ridiculous that just won't work, you know, or, I don't know.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Do they have ToeJam and Earl in there?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I don't think so.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
There's still a lot of great Sega characters they could use.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
But anyway, moving on to other Nintendo news about the Wii U.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
In an interview with IGN, Satoru Iwata said,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
you know what, we're not interested in emulating online services

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
like Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Here we go again with that whole, we gotta be different.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
The jokes write themselves.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Let me read the quote, then you make the joke.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
We have not thought that offering the same features that already exist

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
within other online communities would be the best proposal

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
for very experienced game players.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Nintendo has paid a great deal of attention to the dynamic

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
of people playing video games together in the same room.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
With Wii U, we thought about expanding this concept into separate rooms,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
which are connected online.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Miiverse is a network community dedicated to video games

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
that represents a very unique game-dedicated social graph

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
that has never existed before.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
All right, although I think about half that statement

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
as the typical blowing-smoke-up-my-ass stuff

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
that you get in the PR speak world,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
you do have to admit Miiverse is something different.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
It is not done on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
It is different.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I think you totally missed the whole underlying statement here

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
that they've totally put forth.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
They want you to buy one for each member of your family.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
That's why there's only one game pad for that console.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
It's because each member of your family should own one

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
in their own separate rooms.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
That's right, and they'll connect via the internet.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Don't you know that's why the Wii Mini exists?

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
The Canadian Wii Mini so that every kid's bedroom can have one.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
But it can't be connected to each other because...

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
It doesn't matter. Shut up and go play Wii Sports.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Go to your room. Okay.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Why would I play a game that came out with the Wii?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It's not like it's Super Mario Brothers or something like that.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
You know, a game that actually is awesome.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Shut up and go play Wii Fit.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I'm sorry. That game's terrible.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Wasn't there supposed to be a Wii Fit U?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Yeah, there is.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Where is it?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Launch Window. Remember, they still have six more years.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Excuse me.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Launch Window is such bullshit.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Launch Window should be that week that's coming out.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
You know, if it launches on Sunday...

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Hey, I understand that all games are not going to be free on Sunday.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Like a month. From launch to Christmas would have been Launch Window to me.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Launch Window is not fucking your fiscal year that the launch happens to take place in.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000
That's like calling a hole blown into your wall that's the entire site of your house.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
That's the Launch Window for investors only.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
The people that Nintendo's really trying to speak to.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
That's like calling the wall missing in a dollhouse a window.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Miiverse is very unique. I think it's cool.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
People can write and stuff directly from the gamepad.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
However, if I had it, I wouldn't be able to draw on it.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I can't draw Jack's shit, only stick figures.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Yeah, I gotta admit, the whole Miiverse thing, as much as I do love it,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I think it's great and the community element and so forth,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
it really reminds me how bad of a drawer I am.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I tried to draw one for one of the levels I beat in Mario and it's just, it's not, it's not good.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I'm not a good artist at all.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And the Wii U makes me feel insignificant.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000
You know, I think this is going to be very popular until it goes away,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000
a Pictochat where everyone just kind of like, I'm over it.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I can't believe internet Pictochat's not a thing, but I guess Nintendo can't please that.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
That would be awesome.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Penises everywhere.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Think about the children.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
One of the places Nintendo was getting slammed with the launch of the Wii U console

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
was that you can't really move your Nintendo network account.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Well, some clarity's come forth this week.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Through somebody who sent their bricked Wii U system into Nintendo,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Nintendo in turn sent them back a brand new console that was allowing them to sign in

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
to their previously made Nintendo network account.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So there's the answer.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
If you want to move your Nintendo ID from one console to another,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
just send it in to Nintendo. They'll do it for you.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
That's cost effective.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I'm assuming, especially if they launch Wii U.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
That's the way they do it with the Wii.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
If they, when they launch Wii U's in other colors and other shapes and all this other stuff,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
there'll be a way to do it in the future.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
There'll be a, a move me channel or something.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
It's just stupid.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
It is a little ridiculous.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
It's just like, hey, features that are helpful.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Ah, fuck that. We're different.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
We, we don't want to emulate the guys that actually have functioning online services.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
We're just gonna, we're gonna wing it.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
It's our, we're gonna wing it.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
We're gonna try to create something that's more like, you know, social and stuff.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Oh, patches?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Well, uh, uh, online connectivity?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Uh, well, um, yeah.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I don't know.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Alright, Bobby in our chat room by Black Wolf says,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I drew something that said I couldn't draw.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I got Yaz for it.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
My stick figure flipped a table and a stick kitty told me to please be reasonable with the table.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I haven't seen that drawing yet.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I need to log on to Miiverse.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Alright, uh, let's move on.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Dark Sakura.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Uh, hold on.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Okay, there we go.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Well, uh-

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Hold on to what?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Shush.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
The new Super Mario Bros. 2 is getting Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 levels

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and they are available now.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000
They are through, uh, it looks like free Coin Rush content and is now available to download.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
So, that's good for people who have that.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Yay for DLC, right?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
After that, it's gonna be $250.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Then, um, for the Vita, there is going to be, um, a PlayStation Plus, uh, bundle.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:48.000
So, it's gonna be $300 and, um, it will have the PlayStation Plus Instant Game collection

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.000
and it will be a black 3G Wi-Fi Vita, a year of Plus, and a voucher for download of Unit 13

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
and a 4GB memory card.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And last, uh, but not least, um, Stern is bringing out Avengers Pinball.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Yay.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Which, I mean, we all saw that coming anyway because Stern is basically the only releaser of pinball games now.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
But, hey, it will, uh, hopefully be a good table.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
It's my vehicle.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Facebook plus Google. Slam them together and you get FUGL.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And, uh, we ask a question on our social network communities every week.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
This week is the following.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
What is on your gamer's Christmas list?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Or Hanukkah, Festivus, whatever it is you observe.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
So, that's it. Pretty simple question with the holidays coming up.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
We want to know what people are asking for from Santa Claus and Hanukkah Harry

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
and their Festivus poll and the moon or whatever it is.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
So, starting off with some of the answers from Facebook.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
We have a lot of answers tonight. I can't read them all.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I'm going to read some of the names I don't usually see in chat.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Uh, Dart Charger says,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000
While I wasn't quite willing to pull the trigger myself, I wouldn't mind if Santa put a Wii U under the tree.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I'm not going to buy a Wii U.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
James S. replied and said,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I have my eye on PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
but other than that, I believe next year will be exponentially better.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Possibly even new consoles from Sony and Microsoft.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
You know, we didn't get into it in tonight's news. We're not going to.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:34.000
But, uh, the Microsoft rumors were taken off again about the new console.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Like, it even showed up on my Google News feed.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Uh, just more rumors about Microsoft launching in Holiday 2013.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
And I almost kind of thought that was a given.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I don't know why it suddenly got a little...

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It's just someone else saying the same thing again.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Investors picking up on it.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Oh, we think they're going to...

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
We're an analyst and we think that they're going to launch a new console, you know, next year.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Cool. You know, if I say that, no one fucking cares.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Here's the part that surprised me about that story.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000
The part that was news and interesting is that they may not unveil it at E3.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
They may do their own event.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Which, it makes sense. Why not?

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
They can get away with it. Nintendo does it.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I mean, they do E3, but instead of Tokyo Game Show, they do their own thing.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Why shouldn't Microsoft do their own thing?

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000
I actually think that's a great idea, actually, as long as it's before E3.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Because unveil the console before E3 and then make E3 about...

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
What, everybody? What? What?

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
The games.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Xbox Live. No.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Halo 5?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I would love that. I would love it if E3 could actually be about the game.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
So, alright.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Oop, I guess the music was too loud in that previous segment.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Sorry, I thought it was at its usual volume. My bad.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Live radio, it's fun.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I heard myself. Alright.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Let's see.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Burr replied and said,

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I'm terrible in that I've already bought everything I wanted for myself, like a Wii U and whatnot.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I would love a Steam sale on Borderlands 2 DLC or Mass Effect 3 DLC, however.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Yeah, I mean, that's the thing about growing up, is that you kind of end up buying yourself all the stuff you want.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Like, I bought myself a Wii U. That was kind of my early Christmas present to myself.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I'm not really expecting anything else from anyone.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
You know, I wanted it. I bought it. Happy holidays.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Degenerate Johnny said,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
To be honest, I've been pretty disappointed with this fall's lineup of games.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Therefore, my holiday list will consist of paid-off pre-orders of next year's games,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
such as Dead Space 3, as well as BioShock Infinite.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Tiara from Geek-Life.com said,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I need the new Skyrim DLC, Dragonborn.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
No, really. I need it. For reasons.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Let's see.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Critical Myth replied and said,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Assassin's Creed 3, PlayStation Vita with Assassin's Creed Liberation,

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
and a couple of memory cards. Mass Effect Trilogy. Those are the big ticket items.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
And Dave Falcon said,

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Assassin's Creed 3 for my fiancée for Hanukkah.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Well, that's what you bought somebody else. We want to know what you wanted under your tree.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
But I guess that works.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Let's see. Moving on to our Google Plus community.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Just a few comments here, so I'll read these.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
ActDeft says, I want an HDTV to play games in HD.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I'm still rocking a 15-inch SDTV.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
A 3DS, since it's turning out to be a solid console now.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Forza Horizon Season Pass.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
King of Fighters XIII for 360.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It's free on PlayStation Plus, just saying.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Although I guess PlayStation Plus isn't free, but whatever.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Zone of the Enders HD.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Everything on my Steam wish list.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
RAM for my PC.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
You have a big list, ActDeft.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Oh well, lots of options, right?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Monster Bee wants the following for Christmas.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
A PlayStation 3 controller charging station,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and a Steam gift card to help support my addiction in 2013.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.000
What are you talking about 2013? That winter sale will still be going on in 2012.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And lastly, AJ Twist replied and said,

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
King of Fighters XIII on PlayStation 3,

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
a PlayStation 3 arcade stick,

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV Turtles in Time on the Super Nintendo.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Good pick. Good pick.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
All right, that does it for the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
DarkSakura, do you have any holiday gaming wishes?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Garris.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Oh yes, you even replied on Facebook. You want your Garris figure, right?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Yep.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Where's that from?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Play Arts.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Did you see the Mass Effect museum-style artwork that they were selling?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I didn't see very big pictures of it, but it's okay.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It looked nice. Me wanty.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Loki, anything on your holiday list?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I have really pretty much, you know, I bought the last console game I'm going to get,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.000
so, uh, real thing, you know, if I'm going to get gifted something,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
like a year to PlayStation Plus would be kind of cool,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
because I don't really want to pay for that.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I don't even know if I would really use that.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Maybe a Raspberry Pi, but trying to explain that to anybody.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
You know, it would be difficult for them to understand what the hell I was talking about.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
You want pie? I thought you didn't like pie.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Yeah, that'd pretty much be it.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I was going to say, it's funny, our family, we kind of draw names, you know,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
and just get one person, except for, you know, Josh gets gifts from everybody.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
My wife, she's like, oh, I hope I get your name.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
She's all, you know, instead of, you know, your mom or something like that,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
because I don't know what to get them.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
So, she got my name, and she's like, I'm not getting you anything.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Like, thanks.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Nice, nice, happy holidays.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Well, maybe it'll be a surprise if she does get you something.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Don't hold your breath.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
No, I'm not holding my breath.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Um, on my, again, I pretty much bought everything I wanted,

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
but I wouldn't mind if I got, like, an iCade, or even, like,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
like, one of these things I don't think I would ever buy myself,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
but if it showed up, I'd be kind of happy, would be one of those Atari Flashback consoles.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I like retro shit.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I don't even think they sell those anymore.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
They do at Toys R Us. I saw one the other day.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I figured they'd have old ass inventory.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
They're not the old, they're like the 3, the Flashback 3s,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
or whatever the newest ones are.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
So, I like retro shit.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It amuses me.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Or a Ben Heck Xbox 360 laptop would be fucking awesome.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I want a working Commodore 64 to hook up to my TV,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
which I don't even think you could do without some major converters,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
but damn it, I would try it.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Oh, man.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Well, don't they have, like, an RF adapter?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Yeah, well, um...

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
They have the, well, it's UHF, right?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Yeah, there was, you could hook up...

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Well, they have the UHF to RF. They used to have this.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
You could hook up a Commodore 64 through RF adapter,

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
or something that was very similar to RCA plugs,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
except for one video and two audio, there was two video and one audio.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So, like, you could, like, they didn't cross work,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
but you could probably get a converter for those, too, somewhere.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Well, I think the Commodore 64 monitors were RGB, like, arcade monitors.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.000
So, I have a converter board for that, you know, to play arcade games on your TV.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
AlphaCananagram in our chat room says,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Rob, it's an Atari Flashback 4 with wireless controls now.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Oh, I had no idea. There you go. I want one.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Gimme, gimme, I want it all.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
All right, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
So, you know, Zynga and Facebook have been pretty chummy for a while now,

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
but now they're just trying to read, you know,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
set out new terms as far as their partnership goes.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Basically, what's gonna happen is they're gonna have some opportunities

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
to have Facebook, to have kind of official Facebook games,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000
and also, it'll also kind of tie in with Zynga will still, I guess,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000
use Facebook's payment system, but they're gonna kind of try to,

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I guess, find a way to separate a little bit.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
They're gonna allow, it's gonna allow each of the parties like Zynga

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000
to promote game, their own games that they create,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000
and also, I guess, before they were required to use,

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I guess, Facebook's monetization platform,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
and now Facebook could, you know, make their own games

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
to compete with Farmville and stuff.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
So, unfortunately, you know, the way I see this as,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
you know, there's so many Farmville and those types of game clones,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
it's just, I think Facebook came out with the official Facebook farming game.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I don't think anyone would give a shit.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I think it would be just like, you know, if EA came out with a farming game,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
no one would care.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Insert my typical Facebook rant here.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I'm just, I'm so over Facebook.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
You know, I was talking to somebody on my Facebook tonight

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
about why I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook,

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and there was even a post I saw on Twitter that kind of talked about this,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
and I really do like, I just, I, right now, as of late,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
because even though there are offensive things on Twitter,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
don't get me wrong, like, people tend to offend a lot less on Twitter,

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.000
and I think it's, like, the character restriction kind of is, you know,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
tighter there, so you have to really think before you post,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
and, like, people aren't as forthright to just spew stuff all over,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
and, I don't know, it's great.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I loves Twitter.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000
It's not perfect, but I, and there's no games, no games.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
The only thing that shows up in my feed, promoted posts,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
and luckily, they're pretty easy to scroll past.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Those are also on Facebook.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Oh, yeah. In fact, the Frugal Question of the Week,

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I posted it tonight, and Facebook brings up this little pop-up,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
would you like to promote this post for only $5,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
which made me think, oh, nobody's going to see the Frugal Question of the Week this week,

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
which reminds me, listeners,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
although I'm not always the best at getting the Frugal Question up,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
like, with a lot of time before the show,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I usually have it up a good four or five hours before the show,

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
so, like, you know, about an hour before the show starts,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
load Facebook, go directly to our page,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
and you'll find the question. It's there.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Because I'm worried that Facebook probably isn't showing it to you

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
because of their algorithm.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I would love to see a social network that's, like,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
the good parts of Facebook,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000
combined with the way Twitter works,

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
combined with, like, Tumblr.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Like, the thing I can't stand about Tumblr is that it's all, like,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
you can't, like, comment on anything,

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
and you can't have a conversation on Tumblr.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I hate the way you have conversations on Tumblr.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
There's a lot of good content out there. It's good for fandoms and all that,

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
but I just, I can't figure Tumblr out.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I know Dark Sakura has.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Tumblr's awesome.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Yeah.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Black Wolf says, really? There's Twitter drama every week.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Yeah, but in a Michael Jackson eating popcorn gif kind of way.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
The good news is it usually doesn't involve me or my friends,

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
so I'm okay with it.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Twitter drama is when celebrities say shit, you know.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Anyway.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Moving on.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I don't want to talk all about social networking.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Everybody knows where they stand.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Sales figures coming in from the launch weekend of the Wii U for,

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
excuse me, launch week.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
400,000 Wii U's sold in the first week.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Over that same period,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Nintendo sold 300,000 Wii consoles and 500,000 portable devices.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
That's 1.2 million units sold in the US.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Also, it should be noted that the Xbox and Playstation sales figures came in,

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
and I apologize, I don't have it in front of me,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
but it was around 700,000, 750,000 for the Xboxes,

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.000
and I want to say Sony was 700,000 when you combined both the Playstation 3 and the Vita,

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
which led a lot of people to say,

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
OMG, we use dead already.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
We use dead already.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Xbox 360 is six-year-old consoles out selling the Wii U.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Wait a minute.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
What is the internet forgetting, Loki?

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
They're forgetting that that's all that was available.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
It sold out.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
It's just they only made that many consoles available at the time.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
You also have to figure if they sold any more of that,

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
well, actually the first week would have included Black Friday, I would assume.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
So, you know, there's that kind of thrown there.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
A lot of people are holding back their consoles until Black Friday.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
But yes, there's not like Wii U sitting on the shelves.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Trust me, they're nowhere at all.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And how did the Xbox 360 sell in its first week?

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I mean, those things were fucking diamonds to find when they originally came out.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Remember the Xbox 360 launch and how shitty it was?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Like, those things were really hard to find,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
so I would bet their sales numbers were not so hot,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
and a lot of that was because of supply and demand as well.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So, I think it's comparing apples to oranges a little bit.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Well, and also that's a little bit different, too,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
because, you know, you're talking about a real generation jump there.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
It's the first next-gen console.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Whereas the Wii U is kind of like, it's not really a next-gen console.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I mean, the graphics aren't like,

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
oh my god, this is like way different than what I'm seeing on the other consoles.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
It's just...

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
It's Nintendo doing its thing.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Yeah.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
So, it doesn't have the same impact, I guess.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So, yeah, you can't compare those sales numbers.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I would say look at it, you know,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000
how are the Wii U's selling six months from now?

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
That'll be telling.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Basically, it looks like this.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
If all of a sudden, you know,

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Wii's start getting a bunch in stock, like, right away,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
then that's a problem, because then that means that they're sitting...

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
that there's no demand at the stores.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
They are still showing up at the...

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Speaking of Twitter, haha,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I just saw a picture of a bunch of them sitting at a Best Buy

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
that somebody took a picture of.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
So, I mean, they are being replenished out there,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
so don't think you won't have one for the holidays if you don't want one.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You can still find them.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Even if GameStop got rid of their call list or whatever the hell that was.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Don't go to GameStop.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Yeah, just don't go to GameStop.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Seriously, because I remember it was when I got the PSP.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I don't even know if you were with me or not.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I don't think you were.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
But no, it was when I got the PSP,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I went to GameStop, and they're like,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
oh, good luck finding one of those.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
You'll never find a PSP.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Went to Best Buy.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
They had a whole case of them sitting there.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
So...

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Yeah, I hate the attitude of a lot of people I've seen working there.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
So if you didn't pre-order, you're never going to get that.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Yeah.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
No, that's not true.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Try me, bitch.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Or the games.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I'm not going to get them on release day if I don't pre-order.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Amazon.com.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Pwned.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Like, be aware of what you're really competing with, people.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Anywhere else.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Moving on.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Dark Sakura.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Well, we can move on to other news.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
How about Steam's Greenlight?

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
There's a third batch of games being accepted.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
And it actually looks a little bit like Primordia.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
The other one is Walking Mars.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
But Primordia is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi game

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000
that Valve actually rejected after several indie titles were pulled in.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And then the other one was Walking Mars done by Tigerstyle.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:05.000
It was an OS game and it made App of the Day back for Eurogamer.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Don't know if anyone remembers that.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I think I'm the only one here that follows Eurogamer.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I read a review of theirs today.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I couldn't understand why I didn't jive up with what the rest of the internet was saying.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:23.000
But the now full games on the list is Black Space, DarkFoil and Holy Wars, Dawn of Fantasy,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Dragon's Lair, Eurotruck Simulator 2, Gear Up, Kinetic Void Space Adventure,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.000
The Light, No Time to Explain, Primordia, Sangfroid, Tales of Werewolves, Starforge and Walking Mars.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
So, pretty good.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Loki?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
So the Ouya is making progress.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:48.000
They announced that they're going to be able to start shipping consoles December 28th.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Now, it's not necessarily consoles to users,

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
but those are development kits that are going to be going out

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
for any developers that want to start making games for it.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
And basically, I forget how much money you have to donate

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
or contribute for Kickstarter in order to get one of those.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
It was a few hundred dollars.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
But those people are going to be getting their consoles soon.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
And it sounds like everything is going as planned.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
And man, that thing is tiny.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
It has a tiny console.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000
It's like a Rubik's Cube size.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So that's going to be pretty sweet when that comes out.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Still targeting March as a release.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And of course, right now they're saying that you can download the official development kit

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
if you haven't gotten your console yet and you can start working on stuff

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
and then they're going to be updating that stuff later on.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I think I want to say that every console is going to be coming with a dev kit

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
or some sort of way where you can make your own.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000
If they're so open, I don't see why they wouldn't all function as dev kits in a way.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I think they will. It's just these consoles are a little bit earlier.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
But yeah, it's going to be interesting.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
So it's really happening?

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
It's really happening.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Because when the whole Ouya thing first happened, there were a lot of people saying,

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
and I may or may not have said this myself, sure it'll happen.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
If you put a story about how it's going to fail and stuff, it gets page hits

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
because people want to read up about...

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
They like watching car crashes.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
So we'll see.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And let's be honest, it's not out yet to everybody.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
But I wouldn't be surprised if it's delayed past March

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
because a lot of the Kickstars that I've been contributing to,

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
not a lot of them have been on time.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Like hell, the stuff I got from Freddie Wong and the whole VJHS stuff

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.000
arrived just a couple weeks ago versus the targeted date was March.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
So that's a long delay.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But I have a little trust that they're going to actually deliver on stuff.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
It's just not exactly in the timetable that they were talking about.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
BlackWolf in our chat says,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I'll believe it when I see it. It still has a chance to fail.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
The Mayans predicted its failure.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
True point.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Some of the Kickstarters I've backed, I've only backed two.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
But GamerCon, that has to happen on the weekend.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
They say it's going to happen.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I know they booked the venue and it's moving forward.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
So I don't see how that's not going to happen when they say it does.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
That should be exciting.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
And then the Shadowgate reboot was the other thing I Kickstarted.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
So I'm excited to see what comes of that.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
They send updates all the time.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I had to stop reading them.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
They send too many damn updates.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
They were up to update 29.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I think it's more than that.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
The Shadowgate one.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Did you back that too?

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Yeah, I did. I backed the first one.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.000
It was, I don't even remember what updates they have now.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
But I get updates from a lot of these.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I've got at least four or five right now that I'm waiting on.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Oh, here's another update. Let's see who this one is.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Oh, this is Ouya.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
The same thing I just talked about.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
The dead kids are shipping.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
But yeah, they've got a bunch of updates.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
In fact, there's this one.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I like, there's one I did.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I draw comics sketchbook and reference guide.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Because it looked awesome.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
There you go.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Moving on to another news and rumor type of thing.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Yoshi's Land rumored for the Wii U.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
And now Best Buy and Future Shop are apparently taking pre-orders for it.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
This is after the whole Miiverse hack.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
That's not really a hack, but everybody called it that.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Where the guy found the page, the mockup that Nintendo pulled and put the statement out on.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Apparently Best Buy even has a little description of the game for Yoshi's Land.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Quote, take Yoshi on an epic adventure to remember in Yoshi Land for Nintendo Wii U.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Check out Yoshi as you've never seen him before in glorious high definition.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Enjoy dual screen control thanks to the Wii U touch screen game pad.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Where you'll also be able to experience full integration with Nintendo's Miiverse service.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Well, that's a whole lot of nothing because anybody could guess that on the title alone.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
But it's interesting that that exists.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I'll give you some tin foil hatness here if you want.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I believe Reggie has teased a couple times that maybe we don't really know everything that's going to be in the launch window.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Maybe there's something else.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
This could be that something else.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
And speaking of Twitter and promoted posts.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
One of the posts that fell on my feed earlier this evening was from Spike TV saying,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Hey gamers, don't forget to watch the Spike Video Game Awards.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
More first party exclusive reveals or whatever.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
More big game reveals.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.000
We saw Miyamoto come out on stage at the last Spike TV Awards to great reception.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Maybe, maybe, tin foil hat, Yoshi's Land to be revealed at Spike Gamer Awards.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Discuss.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I think it's just a bunch of bullshit that, you know, let's be honest here.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Of course you do.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Let's be honest, I mean, GameStop was taking, I'm still seeing if it's on here right now.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000
GameStop was taking pre-orders for like, what, Pilotwings for the Wii and like Mario Paint.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000
You know, I think they had Mario Paint for like the Wii U and stuff.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:20.000
There's a whole bunch of TBA stuff that someone gets an idea that there might be something coming out.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And then they'll put a pre-order for it because guess what?

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000
That's giving them your money.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
They're taking a pre-order for a game and if it doesn't come out, hey, guess what?

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.000
We've got this credit that you paid for this game and now you can apply this to another game.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.000
It's why companies love gift cards because there's so many people that never spend them.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Or just, you know, have remaining balances on them that they end up, you know, they throw the card away.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Oh, it's just a 50 cent balance, just throw it away.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Well, the company just made 50 cents off you.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Yeah.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
You know, and if that happens a thousand times, it starts to become a little bit of money.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Tigerclaw has a thought that maybe the Spike VGAs will reveal Bungie's new game, which recently had leaked concept art.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
That's another great thought, actually.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
They've already said which games are getting reveals, or at least some of them.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Like The Last of Us, and I don't think it's necessarily revealed, but like a new gameplay thing.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:32.000
And I'm trying to remember what else was on there. I think maybe Fuse? I don't know.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
I watched the little trailer that they had with Samuel L. Jackson as a baby. That was weird.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Eh. I didn't watch any of it. I'm just gonna wait until five minutes after the show's over, and then everything shows up on YouTube.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
That's all I need. I just want the YouTubes with the reveals.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Kind of like the year that Skyrim was announced. YouTube.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Do you think maybe a new Batman game will be announced?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
God, I hope not.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000
It could be, but what are you talking about? Bite your tongue.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Arkham City was amazing. You know where you can put that thumb.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Alright, let's move on. Loki gave me a thumbs down.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
You really hate Arkham City?

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
I don't hate it. I've never played it. But I just don't want to see another...

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
You don't know shit! Shut up!

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I don't want to see another Batman game. I think it's stupid.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Oh my God. Oh, this conversation. I can't talk to you.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Why would you have another Batman game when they just released one last year?

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I mean, seriously, what is it again? Batman Arkham State! Oh, the whole state is a prison now!

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I think they had joked they were going to call it Arkham World, but that didn't...

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Arkham World?

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
That didn't actually mean...

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Hey, I have an idea. Let's get Snake Pliston in here. He'll fucking escape from New York.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Oh wait, but it's going to be Batman instead. But hey, whatever. We'll just rip it off. It'll be fun.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
It doesn't actually mean world, dummy.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
We're going to see how many more Batman villains we can shove in here.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Hey, is there any other obscure Batman villains that we haven't tackled yet?

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
You know, maybe we can just get Lex Luthor in there because we're running out of Batman villains.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Your opinion does not even count! You haven't even played the game!

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
You lose! Good day, sir!

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I am totally enjoying this. I'm just sitting back going, mm-hmm.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
He's an idiot! Tell him!

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Rob thinks you're an idiot.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Cool. I don't care what Rob thinks.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Well, we care what you think.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails, you know, if you want to call low-key an idiot.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
You know what? I'm such an idiot because I actually don't have the mailbag pulled up.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Dark Soccer, you're an idiot too! I'm surrounded by idiots!

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I am not!

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
No, you're surrounded by assholes. It's different.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I'm going to go play Arkham City.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Hold on, I'm pulling it up.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:57.000
It's just, I've been sort of doing some damage management of a severe nature.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Okay.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Sorry, I'm pulling up the email now.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Alright.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I want gossip, girl. You gotta tell me about this after the email bag.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
TigerClawn.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I played Arkham Asylum at E3.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
You know what game I hate? Earth Defense Force.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
That's fine.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Oh, lord.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.000
See, now you're just trolling.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
It's for bros. Oh, I've never played it.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Now you're just trolling.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
They see you trolling, they're hating.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Well, we only have one email.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Okay.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Hello, OLR. Another email from Belgium here.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Yay, Belgium!

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Since Sony is doing so bad, I've been thinking lately, do you guys think Sony will have enough resources to launch a decent next-gen system?

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.000
It costs billions of dollars to develop and launch a new console and they don't have that kind of money.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I think they do.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Also, with their rating dropping, banks will be less eager to loan the money.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I believe Nintendo made the Wii technologically inferior because of money problems, or is this wrong?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
You know what?

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
That's a damn good point.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I don't know.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
It could be, the PlayStation 4 could end up being a bunch of smoke and mirrors, too.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:12.000
It could be that, you know, this whole tech with the controller changing or whatever may be the big thing,

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
and it's not really that souped up of a system.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I kind of think the internet would crucify them if that happened.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Honestly, someone trying to separate their controller that they have right now.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I broke my controller, I split it in two, and it's not working like I saw in the picture.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I've said this before and I'll say it again.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I don't think Sony has to launch a new console next year.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Why not sell more PlayStation 3s by putting out amazing games?

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.000
You know, I realize a lot of people expect Sony to put out a console next year because of what Microsoft is doing, but...

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000
I don't even know if Microsoft's putting out a console next year.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
That's all, yeah, that's all...

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Remember, we're just listening to analysts that are speaking out of their ass.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
That's right.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Anal.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Also, I'll go ahead and read it.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Also, I'd like to ask if you guys would plug the volunteering I do for a local playground.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
I posted a thread in an off-topic part of the forum called,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Can you please vote for us on a website?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And that's on our VOG forum, so you can look for it.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.000
We have a chance to win, I guess it's 2,000 euros if we get the most votes.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
As always, thanks a lot for making a new episode every week.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
You rock.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
P.S. if we win the contest, I'll send you a box of Belgian chocolates.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Ooh, deal.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Totally, as long as they're dark chocolate.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Go vote now.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I'm gonna share this with the chat room.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
It is a playground, it's volunteer.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
It's for a good cause.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
We totally support this.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
We like games of all sorts.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Including the ones you play outdoors.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
So, good luck buddy, I hope you win.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
And yes to the chocolate.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
By the way, you'll love this idea.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Or maybe you won't, I don't know.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
But, um, Sil from Girls Gone Wow.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
I love Sil.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I love her too, she's so great.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
But, uh, we were talking to each other on Facebook.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
And we're gonna do a candy exchange.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Where she's gonna send me candy from the UK that you can't get here.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
And I'm gonna send her stuff from the US that we all take for granted that you can't get over there.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
I guess, like, Pop-Tarts?

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
You can't get in the UK?

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Peanut butter.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Really?

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Yeah.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Rob, they use Marmite.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Ugh.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Ugh.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Weird.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
You know what?

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Um, I did a candy exchange with, um, with, uh, Robert K.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And he sent me...

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Now, sadly, I was allergic to the candy that he sent me because I can't eat gummies.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Don't.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
But I sent...

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I would've eaten it.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I brought it, remember?

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
The Jelly Babies and stuff?

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
That's right, you did.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:38.000
But, um, I sent a bunch of these, um, Baskin-Robbins candies that were these hard candies flavored

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
like Baskin-Robbins ice creams.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Oh, yeah.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
I remember those.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Those are good.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
And he said he really liked them.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I also sent him cans of salsa.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Is that something you can't get over there?

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
I'm not sure you can get salsa.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.460
Just, this was actually, like, the, uh, the, uh, what's, what's the Mexican, um, grocery

02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:54.460
stores called?

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:57.120
Um, oh, God.

02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.120
No, this was actually, like, authentic.

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.280
Yeah, down, down in L.A. you see them everywhere.

02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:02.280
I can't remember the name of it.

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.280
Carson something?

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.280
Yeah, yeah.

02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:05.280
Carcinogen.

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.760
Well, okay, what's funny is that Sil linked me to a website that, you know, I would never

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:15.160
look this shit up, but it's a store in the U.K. that sells American imported goods.

02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:18.720
And it was just hilarious looking at the stuff they were advertising on the site, like Captain

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:19.720
Crunch.

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:21.920
I'm like, oh, I take that shit for granted that you can just get Captain Crunch at the

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.280
grocery store here.

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:28.640
And even speaking of, like, Mexico, you could get, cause how easy is it to get yarritos?

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.840
The soda, right?

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.840
Here it is.

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:33.320
I'd never saw one until I moved out here.

02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:36.720
But especially, like, even at Target and stuff, you can get, like, the quote unquote Mexican

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:37.720
Coke.

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:38.720
It's very easy to get.

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.720
They have a whole little wall.

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:42.760
Well, I'll tell you what, you see it a lot during Passover because it's not made with

02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:43.760
corn syrup.

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:44.760
Ah, very true.

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:46.560
And corn is considered not kosher for Passover.

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:48.040
But you see it all the time at Target.

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:49.720
Like, Target has their...

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.720
Or throwback.

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:54.320
Jones soda, I guess, is the thing, too, you can't get in the U.K.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.320
Jones is so good.

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.680
It's even kind of hard to find here.

02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:00.960
I wish we could get one of the Thanksgiving boxes and send it over because, you know,

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:05.240
like the gravy one is weird, but I hear that the cranberry sauce soda is actually really

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.240
delicious.

02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:07.240
Here's the thing, though.

02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:12.320
Cyl says she can't have it till February because she's on a lifestyle adjustment until February,

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:13.960
so she can't get the candy till then.

02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:18.760
But little does she know, she didn't say how big the box had to be.

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:22.800
So I plan on spoiling her because I do really like Cyl.

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.720
She's great being a team player with a vog and everything, so she's going to have a lot

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:31.000
of candy coming her way.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.320
How easy is it to get candy here?

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:37.200
Like I'll just go to Target the day after Christmas, get all that candy.

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:38.200
It'd be crazy.

02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:39.200
All right.

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:40.200
Let's move on.

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.200
Enough candy talk.

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:42.200
That was it for emails, huh?

02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:43.200
Just one email tonight?

02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:44.200
Yeah.

02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:48.880
Email mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to email us in a future episode.

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:55.920
Meanwhile, it's time for a segment we do every week here on the show, often imitated, never

02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:56.920
duplicated.

02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:57.920
Haha.

02:05:57.920 --> 02:05:58.920
It's the FUs of the week.

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:24.320
Um, FUs to misunderstandings, um, and yeah, I'm doing, um, some damage control.

02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:29.600
It's not a big thing, not really, um, it's just, yeah.

02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:39.160
Anyway, um, and, uh, also, uh, FUs to, uh, the, what, three inches of water in my backseat

02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:40.800
on the passenger side.

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:45.480
Um, there's a seal broken somewhere in my car and yeah, that almost cost me my laptop

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:46.480
once.

02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:49.480
So yeah, that sucks.

02:06:49.480 --> 02:07:00.600
Um, I guess FU to, I don't know, I don't know where, I'd rather take the, you know, the

02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:10.080
week off and play some far cry three, but, uh, you know, job money, I don't open.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.040
Black Wolf wanted us to clarify that what you're talking about has nothing to do with

02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:16.040
fog.

02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.040
Everything's happy-go-lucky above.

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:25.040
Um, as far as I know, um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to, um, sleeping so much.

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:29.760
Oh my God, you guys is disgusting how much I've slept over this weekend, but I feel great.

02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:31.680
Uh, and FU to the weather.

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:33.920
It's been nonstop shitty for the past three days.

02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:34.920
I'm thankful.

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:35.920
It's finally clear enough.

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:36.920
That makes me for a couple of days.

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:37.920
Shut up.

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:42.720
I don't like for a couple of days though, as long as it's not as bad as I don't mind

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:46.640
like the light rain and all this, but just the constant like shit after shit followed

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:47.980
by more shit.

02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:49.920
And then the warning, it's going to flood shit everywhere.

02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:53.040
I put up my Christmas lights to clean out my gutters.

02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:58.100
They're released on the tree one night later, all the leaves fell every single one of them

02:07:58.100 --> 02:08:01.960
into the gutters like, God damn it.

02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:04.680
Why couldn't have been lazy longer?

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.600
All right.

02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:10.800
Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then we'll open up the Skype line at one

02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:11.800
eight seven seven game.

02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:12.800
O L R.

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:13.800
All right.

02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:19.720
So there was a, a new Kickstarter for this LA game space and what's kind of unique about

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:20.720
it.

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:25.520
Um, they're going to be creating some new games to kind of, I guess, go along with this.

02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:29.840
And some of the games that they're getting created are actually by some pretty famous

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.360
people including, um, they've got the creator of Katamari Damacy.

02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:41.960
Um, was it, uh, Keita or Keita, uh, Takahashi Keita Takahashi.

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:47.680
And also they had, uh, Adam Saltzman, who is the guy did a cannibal.

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:51.520
And they're going to be, um, I guess, creating a game for the people that back the project

02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:56.600
also, um, to go along with that, they've got some more, um, games being coming or coming

02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:57.600
out.

02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.880
I guess there are going to be 30 new games from different, uh, indie developers are pretty

02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:10.680
prominent including, um, stuff by, uh, was it the guy did Hotline Miami, uh, Steve Swink

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:12.520
of Scale.

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.600
And also, I guess, uh, the guy that did, uh, Unfinished Swan.

02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:22.640
And they're going to get, uh, Pendleton Ward also, um, who did, uh, I guess, he's doing

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:31.920
a game with, um, Banette Foddy who did QWOP and CLOP, which I really need to go back and

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:35.880
play because, oh god, CLOP was awesome.

02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:41.180
Uh, so yes, they're going to be, if you, um, and that, it's pretty awesome, if you pledge

02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:43.560
$15 or more you get those 30 games.

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.120
So that's pretty awesome.

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:51.440
And $5 or more and you get that one game that's being done by, um, the two first guys I mentioned.

02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:53.680
So definitely check it out.

02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:57.200
They're probably going to hit their goal because they're looking for $250,000.

02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:00.600
They have four days left to go and they're at $234,000, so.

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.600
I think they'll be okay.

02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:02.600
I think they'll be alright.

02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:05.920
Although, although there was another one I did see that they were looking for $50,000,

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.760
they missed it by $28.

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:09.480
Oh ho ho.

02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:10.840
And if you don't make it, you get none of it.

02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:11.840
You get none of it.

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:12.840
You can try again.

02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:13.840
Ouch.

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:14.840
Yeah, that's true.

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:20.200
Alright, well, lastly tonight, before we go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR and the Twitter

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:23.680
at twitter.com slash O-L-R, this is a bit of a visual.

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:26.440
I apologize guys, but you can Google this.

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:33.680
The cover of the final Nintendo Power has been released and it is awesomely nostalgic.

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:36.040
I think it's a perfect send off to the magazine.

02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:37.980
It ends the way it began.

02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:42.920
The final cover looks a lot like the first cover only instead of, you know, the very

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:46.140
first cover in Nintendo Power was Super Mario 2.

02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:49.480
And so you have Wart in the background and you have like the vegetables cause that was

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.400
a big part of Mario 2.

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:56.840
The final cover of Nintendo Power is for New Super Mario Brothers U with Bowser in the

02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:02.720
background and Goombas, but still just the very similar, you know, look.

02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:06.600
You clearly get the reference here if you've been a fan of Nintendo Power.

02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.960
Also what's very interesting when you put the two covers side by side, you really notice

02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:14.800
that on that first cover of Nintendo Power, Mario's color palette was wrong.

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:15.800
It was reversed.

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:16.800
Yeah.

02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.200
The blue overalls is right and the red shirt, but his hat, his hat's wrong.

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:26.600
So kind of interesting that that's all screwed up, but regardless, a great send off and even

02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.800
like the same colors as a designer Dark Sakura doesn't make you happy.

02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:32.360
Yeah, for the most part.

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.280
I mean, it's actually a lot better laid out.

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:37.280
It's more dynamic.

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:38.280
I'll say that.

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:43.780
But then again, the Nintendo Power logo, the new one also lends itself to a bit more dynamic

02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:45.880
because of the differences in size.

02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:50.360
I also just like, like even the little POW is the same, the little POW poster inside.

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.600
Poster inside is like the same.

02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:52.700
I love it.

02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.880
So it makes me sad to see Nintendo Power go.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:58.680
But then again, if I was going to be that sad, I wouldn't have stopped reading it about

02:11:58.680 --> 02:11:59.840
like 15 years ago.

02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:03.080
Sorry not to be Debbie Downer, but that's the reason why the magazines are going out

02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.220
of business.

02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:09.160
So hopefully there'll be something else in the future, maybe a newsstand app on the iPhone

02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:10.160
or something.

02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:12.560
I don't know, but we'll see.

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:15.160
Anyhow, let's go to the phones.

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:20.080
One eight seven seven game O.L.R. or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:25.440
Oh, act deft catches this in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com, pointing

02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:30.280
out the last issue has Mario going to the pole, meaning the end.

02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.200
I didn't even catch that.

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:35.240
It looked like the halfway point flagged me, but going to the pole because that's where

02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.840
he's going to work from now on.

02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:42.040
On the pole, the whole Mario is not going to the pole.

02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.040
Whole new era.

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:44.440
Mario is not going to the pole.

02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:46.360
Those games still sell like crazy.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:50.040
I guarantee besides Nintendo Land is the top selling Wii U game right now.

02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:53.320
Yeah, but what's what's the way you're going to expand your demographic into the stripper

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.920
market than getting, you know, strippers in your games?

02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:02.400
Yes, because that's exactly what they need to get at Nintendo is strippers.

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.040
I think I need strippers now.

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.680
I think they should.

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.400
All right.

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:12.240
Again, the phones one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or a username on Skype is orange lounge

02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:13.240
radio.

02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:16.840
Before I get to the Twitter's, Loki, do you have any last minute?

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:20.400
Yeah, they have got some cool plug ins for Gary's mod.

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:25.440
It's coming out December six and it's basically a Kinect PC plug in.

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.120
You'll be able to do body capture using the Kinect.

02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:34.000
You're going to need Kinect for Windows runtime version one point six.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.800
But you're going to be able to do all sorts of funny stuff with Gary's mod with that.

02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:40.800
All right.

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:41.800
Let's go to the phones.

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:42.800
We have a call coming in.

02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:43.800
Hi.

02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:44.800
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:45.800
Who's this?

02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:47.440
He's like, oh, we see you tonight.

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:49.760
Yes, because I have a webcam now.

02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:50.760
You sure do.

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:51.760
All right.

02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:52.760
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.760
You know, I need to get a webcam.

02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:54.760
Still need one.

02:13:54.760 --> 02:14:01.960
I know you have a question the week so on the face of my Facebook news feed earlier

02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:03.960
today and get a chance to answer it.

02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:06.900
But there is one thing I am looking forward.

02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:13.200
This holiday season is supposed to PS3 that my girlfriend is hinting at.

02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:14.200
So I am.

02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:16.920
In other words, a new system is probably on my way.

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:17.920
Lucky you.

02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:24.020
Well, I mean, it makes it for the fact that I got her car stereo and the other Hanukkah

02:14:24.020 --> 02:14:27.620
present that will be forthcoming.

02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:28.620
You can't give it.

02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:29.620
You never know.

02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:30.640
She might be a listener of this program.

02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:32.400
You don't want to give it all away.

02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:35.280
Well, actually, she doesn't listen to this.

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:42.600
I mean, video games is only a small fraction of her life aside from taking care of wildlife

02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:45.880
and watching anime and British dramas.

02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:52.760
But yeah, now that I am going to presume that I am definitely getting a PS3 this holiday

02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:56.680
season, I am just trying to see where to begin from there.

02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:01.480
Because this is like the first time I am getting a new system since I got my 360.

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.920
Well, I was just about to ask you, if let's say you are right on your hunch and you do

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.440
end up getting a PlayStation 3, what do you think you are going to get?

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:14.160
I am probably going to get the games that I were hinting at, stuff like Gran Turismo

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:22.760
5, Metal Gear Solid 4, the Uncharted series, so pretty much all of the PS3 exclusives.

02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:26.560
Because there is no way I am going to get any other multi-platform game that I would

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.600
otherwise get off PC.

02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:34.600
I think this goes to the argument that if you compare both Microsoft and Sony in terms

02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:44.920
of games that are more first party, it looks like if you compare them side by side aside

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:53.440
from Halo and Forza and Fable, you have a bit more first party titles on Sony's side

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.560
than you would in Microsoft.

02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:58.120
Anything in between is just multi-platform.

02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:02.040
Since it came up earlier, we were talking a lot about how Sony has a lot of great download

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:03.880
stuff on PSN that people are overlooking.

02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:09.280
Do you have any interest in Journey or the Swann game or Unfinished Swann or any of that

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:10.280
stuff?

02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:12.160
Yeah, I would have to.

02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:13.840
I am definitely looking forward to it.

02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:20.320
I am looking forward to Home in particular and seeing what that thing is about.

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.760
More importantly, I guess after I get the PS3, then I have to figure out which high

02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:29.720
def TV I am looking for because I am putting it off, to be honest, trying to find something

02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:35.400
that is really fast, that is under one frame of black.

02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:42.440
For my rhythm and dancing games, I need something really fast and it can't be a fighting game.

02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:46.400
I am really holding off until I find something, something that is tried and true that others

02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:52.720
have used with certainty that I can easily buy in my local Best Buy that same day.

02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:56.880
Most of the TVs now, as long as you are not buying a bargain basement TV, most of the

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:59.680
TVs now you are not going to have a problem with that.

02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:03.720
The technology is much better now and you don't really have that same type of lag.

02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:09.480
They know that people want HDTVs to play video games, so a lot of them advertise very low

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:10.480
lag.

02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:15.640
Right, but that is contrary to what I am hearing in the Shoryuken forums on the big fighting

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:18.320
game community site.

02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:28.000
In their tech talk section, they do have threads for sub one frame high def TVs.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:33.600
Most of them are either available or they are just discontinued, but for the most part

02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:36.760
it is monitors that are damn near lagless.

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:40.260
You have some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:44.980
Shining Force 3inator, hey that name is going to get you arrested, says, I put up a thread

02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:49.220
on the vlog boards with some PS3, PSN recommendations.

02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:51.780
Brad from Pod Culture is suggesting a Vizio.

02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:57.140
Go Vizio, it is the best bang for your buck, not at Best Buy, Wally World or Costco.

02:17:57.140 --> 02:17:59.340
I am not going to Wal-Mart.

02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:00.340
I got mine at Costco.

02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:02.340
I actually had a great experience at Costco, I can't complain.

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:09.860
I just need something that I can play 2DX on in an occasional fight game that is fast

02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:14.500
that I don't have to offset for timing.

02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:17.220
And then I would pick up a high FTV amount on my wall.

02:18:17.220 --> 02:18:21.740
And then maybe someday Konami will put out, now that they have gone HD with 2DX, they

02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:26.000
will actually put out all they have missed on like one Uber Playstation 3 game, at least

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
we can dream.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Sure.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Sure.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Right.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.060
And that is the day when like pigs fly from the skyline.

02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:34.060
Exactly.

02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:36.540
That is the day when Rock Revolution 2 is announced.

02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:40.180
Alright Zaku, I got to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call and I hope

02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:41.180
you do get the PS3.

02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:42.180
Good luck.

02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:43.180
Alright.

02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:45.180
Alright, take care buddy.

02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:46.180
Bye.

02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:48.820
I like the video.

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:52.980
I want more people to call in with video even though it is a radio show, at least I am amused.

02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:55.820
But please, for the love of God, make sure you are decent if you are going to call in

02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:56.820
on video.

02:18:56.820 --> 02:19:02.140
Alright, Loki, any other stories?

02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:06.300
Microsoft Vancouver is now Black Tusk Studios and apparently they are working on the next

02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:08.060
big franchise for the Xbox.

02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:11.220
Oh, like something for the new Xbox maybe?

02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:15.260
Just whatever the next big AAA franchise is going to be.

02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:18.340
What could it be?

02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:22.500
Going to the Twitters at Twitter.com slash OLR, Spazinator wants to know, what are the

02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:26.060
odds of a Gangnam style parody with a Mass Effect theme?

02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:27.060
Garris style anyone?

02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:28.260
You mean that hasn't already been done?

02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:29.260
That could easily be done.

02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:30.260
It has been done.

02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:32.260
Check out, there is this thing called Tumblr.

02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:36.900
I was going to say, it is definitely possible now that they have the JibJab app or whatever

02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:40.220
you can upload pictures of people.

02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:46.540
So true story, the other day I was looking up YouTube videos and I found myself on Psy

02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:49.540
and I was like, I wonder if his other music is any good and I was looking at one of his

02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:52.340
other songs and I was like alright, that's kind of cool.

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:53.340
Passionate Goodbye is really good.

02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:57.540
And then if you look on the right side at all the related videos, it was all of these

02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:59.900
Psy videos, like Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy.

02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:04.580
But then there was this one video towards the top, Hippopotamus takes a massive dump

02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:07.580
at the zoo.

02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:11.660
Guess which one I clicked?

02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:19.260
And I was like, this is more interesting than the Psy video.

02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:21.460
Alright.

02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:23.620
Did you hear that Glee did Gangnam Style?

02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:24.620
Oh God.

02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.360
Do they actually speak Korean?

02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:27.360
I don't know.

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:28.800
I'm sure it's terrible.

02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:33.220
When I was discovering Adventure Time last night, after five seasons of not ever watching

02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:38.600
any of it, I found that someone did an Adventure Time Gangnam Style.

02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:39.600
Good Lord.

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:43.800
Really the one you should look up is the Gangnam Style crossed with Too Legit to Quit with

02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:44.800
NC Hammer.

02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:55.600
I'm not sure who's speaking Korean.

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.760
That just sounds wrong.

02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:00.760
Let's go to the phones.

02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:01.960
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:02.960
Who's this?

02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:04.960
This is Haseo Sumuragawa.

02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:08.760
Hey, how are you doing?

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:10.280
I'm doing pretty well.

02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.280
What's on your mind, Haseo Sumuragawa?

02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:23.960
Well, I was putting my plate bid for the trophy course among the listeners.

02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:25.680
Wait, wait.

02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:29.320
You're putting in your bid for being a trophy whore among the listeners?

02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:36.320
Just a small recommendation.

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:43.120
It's supremely cheap to, if you haven't played them yet, to pick up the God of War saga.

02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:53.880
Then it's the three main games on disc and you get a download voucher for the PSP collection.

02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:57.760
And I bet you can find that pretty cheap these days because that God of War collection

02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:59.120
came out a couple years ago.

02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:04.040
We actually have it too.

02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:09.640
They recently re-released it as the God of War saga because it originally was the God

02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:16.760
of War HD collection which was one and two and then that came out right in time for three

02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:24.240
or round three and then they came out HD collection which was Change of Olympus and

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.240
Ghost of Sparta.

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:29.800
But with the God of War saga, you get all five games.

02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:31.840
So you say you're the resident trophy whore.

02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:34.080
What is your PlayStation level?

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:36.280
14.

02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:37.280
That's pretty good.

02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:41.440
I think I'm only at like seven or eight, but I don't, I mean, you know, do you play other

02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:47.160
consoles or like just, are you like only Sony in your house?

02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:53.880
Only Sony, but you know, I'm thinking about maybe picking up a 360 to check out, you know,

02:22:53.880 --> 02:23:09.480
like the games I miss on 360 such as Halo and Gears of War because I hear good things.

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:13.920
You've been talking a little bit tonight about how a lot of people have been overlooking

02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:15.720
some of the good stuff that Sony's doing.

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:19.460
Like it doesn't seem like a lot of people tend to care about Move and there's so much

02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:22.760
good stuff on PlayStation Network that tends to go overlooked.

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:27.640
As somebody who's a bit of a Sony fan, what do you think people are missing by not giving

02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:32.120
Sony more credit?

02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:41.080
First of all, the first three games such as God of War, Infamous, and the entire series

02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:46.040
are all really great series.

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:57.280
And I mean, even like the download games like Journey, as you mentioned earlier, and Flow

02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:01.840
and Flower, they're truly great games.

02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:07.520
And not to mention the PS3 has been getting a whole lot of the collections compared to

02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:08.520
the 360.

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:09.520
I gotcha.

02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:10.520
Yeah, it's true.

02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:15.840
They put it, they put a lot of that good stuff, like all those collections out on disc.

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:18.520
It makes a good point to like a good starting point.

02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:22.840
Like the Journey collection, you know, has Flower and Flow and all that would be a great

02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.960
starting point for somebody.

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:25.960
Yes.

02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:37.680
Plus, with that, I mean, if I remember correctly, because my friend bought it, it was $30 plus

02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:44.440
you got a free month of PlayStation Plus and a whole bunch of player IDs and I think even

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.440
a theme.

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:46.440
Nice.

02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:47.440
Very cool.

02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:48.440
All right.

02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:55.600
Well, before we let you go, is there anything else you want to share with us tonight?

02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:58.560
No, the coin's revenge could have been better.

02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.360
How so?

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:07.360
It was too short and they kind of ended it a different way than I was expecting.

02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:08.360
All right.

02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:10.360
Well, no giving away the ending.

02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:11.360
All right.

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:12.360
Well, take care, buddy.

02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:13.360
Thanks a lot for the call.

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:14.360
No problem.

02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:15.360
All right.

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:16.360
Bye bye.

02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:21.640
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.160
Somebody there is sticking up for the PlayStation 3 and giving some more recommendations there.

02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:28.440
For the record, I have to say Meg C and Kristin say hi.

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:32.720
Hello and please ask when they're coming to California because we miss them.

02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:33.720
Okay, I will.

02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:37.560
There is a whole new generation of OLR listeners that have no idea who the OLR lesbians are

02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:38.780
and they need to be introduced.

02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:39.780
They need to return.

02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:41.280
That's right.

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:43.760
Remind them the episode 500 is coming up.

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:45.760
All right.

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.080
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.880
A couple of tweets from SSJ100Matt.

02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:55.240
An idea ahead of its time from Sega.

02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:00.840
Arcade Heroes takes a look back at the Sega Super Circuit from 1989.

02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:07.640
It links us to a story from Arcade Heroes, which I'll get to in a minute after this call.

02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:09.800
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:10.800
Who's this?

02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:11.800
Word, dog.

02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:12.800
It's Jim Sally.

02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:13.800
Holy crap.

02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:14.800
Holy crap.

02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:15.800
It's video.

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:16.800
Oh my God.

02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:17.800
Jim Sally's on the video.

02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:18.800
Are you in the bathroom?

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:22.440
It's just with him moving back and forth and all that.

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:23.440
Well, no.

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:24.440
That wall looks like tile, like bathroom.

02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:25.440
Oh no.

02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:26.440
It's, I see.

02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:28.440
It did have a little bit of that vibe of the sitting on the toilet video.

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:29.440
Sitting on the toilet.

02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:30.440
Oh my.

02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:31.440
Dude, you're on a roof.

02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:32.440
It's the Canadian skyline.

02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:33.440
He's outdoors smoking.

02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:34.440
That's what they do in Canada.

02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:35.440
I don't know what I'm doing.

02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:36.440
This could be anything.

02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.440
Those might give you cancer.

02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:38.440
All right.

02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:39.440
No, it's organic.

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:40.440
Oh, it's a toothpick.

02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:41.440
Oh, it's floss.

02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:42.440
Clearly.

02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:43.440
It's a toothpick.

02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:44.440
It's a toothpick.

02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:45.440
It's a toothpick.

02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:46.440
It's a toothpick.

02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:47.440
It's a toothpick.

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:48.440
It's a toothpick.

02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:52.920
That's clearly, all right, so that means that he has wonderful, a dental hygiene or

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:53.920
something.

02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:54.920
All right.

02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:55.920
Jim Sally.

02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:57.840
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:58.840
Not much, man.

02:26:58.840 --> 02:26:59.840
It's a long time.

02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:00.840
No C. I thought I'd call in say what's up.

02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:01.840
So you make sure things.

02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:03.520
Okay, I'm doing my, I'm doing my time to get here, man.

02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:09.200
Look, I'm all dressed up for the occasion looking fly.

02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:10.200
Thank you.

02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:12.620
Thank you for wearing clothes.

02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:14.600
When you call it to the show.

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:15.600
Cause I'm afraid.

02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:17.760
One of these days I am disappointed at the, no, I'm kidding.

02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:18.760
Stop.

02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:19.760
I'm afraid that one.

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:20.760
Dude, look at those guns.

02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:24.140
Jim, it's a radio show.

02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:25.640
They're not going to be able to see your muscles.

02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:27.640
That was just for you Rob.

02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:29.840
He's invited us to the gun show.

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.040
You know what I'm saying?

02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:33.700
Here's my fan boy hearts and eyes.

02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:35.480
I wish we don't have a webcam in return.

02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:36.680
I can't, we'll get one.

02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:37.680
We're going to get a webcam.

02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:41.920
I like to just hear your soft voice anyway, buddy.

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.080
The webcam is at my house.

02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:49.760
Looks like I'm looking at you in the, in the studio right now.

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:50.760
Here's me.

02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:54.540
I'm going to give you a kiss on the cheek.

02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:56.840
This is great radio guys.

02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:57.840
Great radio.

02:27:57.840 --> 02:27:58.840
Smiley.

02:27:58.840 --> 02:27:59.840
I am.

02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:00.840
Okay.

02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:01.840
Let's do radio.

02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:02.840
Let's do radio.

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:03.840
Let's go.

02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:04.840
Jim, what kind of games have you been into lately?

02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:05.840
Oh man.

02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:07.040
You guys talked about the golden accent too long ago.

02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:09.080
The great golden X game on the Sega.

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:12.520
Oh, I do remember playing that game and being vicious with my friends.

02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:16.800
We used to play only two players at a time you could have, but there was three of us.

02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.400
So whoever died would have to hand the controller off to the guy sitting out.

02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:22.080
And that was pretty much how we played the game the whole time.

02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:23.480
There were a lot of punch buggies, man.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:26.720
We used to freak out when those little trolls would come out and who got to kill the trolls.

02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:30.280
We would usually kill each other and then never get to the second level.

02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:33.920
That's a hilarious style of gaming I haven't seen since I was young.

02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:37.520
But yeah, we used to do that too with like Mario brothers is that up you died, hand off

02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:38.520
the controller.

02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:39.520
That's right.

02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:40.520
Someone else's turn.

02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:41.520
I think that's from the arcade, right?

02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:42.520
Because you die.

02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:43.640
Someone else gets to put a quarter in.

02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:44.640
That's true.

02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:47.640
It's very true.

02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:48.640
Good times of gold night.

02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:51.240
You know, I was thinking back when dark soccer was talking about golden X and I was like,

02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:57.640
you know, all things considered golden X actually wasn't very good, but when we were younger,

02:28:57.640 --> 02:28:58.640
it was the shit.

02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:03.320
And it was so much fun to play in the arcades and not to spoil a 20 year old game or whatever,

02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:07.280
but the ending was great with all the characters actually jumping out of the arcade machine.

02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:08.280
Remember that?

02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:09.280
That was hilarious.

02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:10.280
That was an awesome ending.

02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:11.280
It was very-

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.280
So worth it.

02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:13.280
Fourth wall.

02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:15.520
Oh my God.

02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:17.000
He has a hat that says Jim Sally.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.360
It says, dude, I have a whole line of hats that say Jim Sally.

02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:20.360
Here, check it out.

02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:24.160
Is that like a clothing line we can check out on, on a cafe press?

02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:27.160
You have to tell me what texture you're using because it looks kind of like Cooper, but

02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:28.160
not really.

02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:30.720
Um, I think that this was like jungle use or something.

02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:31.720
I don't know.

02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:34.760
I use different texts, whatever they have at the, I use lids.

02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:37.840
You need to do a Helvetica one and make it look extra design.

02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:40.120
This show is getting too nerdy for me.

02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:42.600
Um, Rob just doesn't know typography.

02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:46.120
I love though that we're getting a little glimpse of Canadian right there.

02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:48.080
I hope you don't get, is that snow on the ground?

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:49.080
Dude, look at this.

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:51.080
I had to shovel this shit, man.

02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.080
Oh my.

02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:53.080
Just not too long ago.

02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:54.080
Look.

02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:55.080
Yeah dude, it got, it was, it was-

02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:56.400
What's that white mythical stuff?

02:29:56.400 --> 02:29:57.600
We're from California.

02:29:57.600 --> 02:29:58.600
Like I'm like, Ooh, what is that?

02:29:58.600 --> 02:29:59.600
No.

02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:01.260
Rob, for the record, it does snow in Alabama.

02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:05.160
And it does snow 45 minutes up the hill here in California because we are, we are like

02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:07.560
two less than two hours away from Lake Tahoe.

02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:10.000
So I can handle the cold though.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.360
Look at what you get when you shovel the snow.

02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:12.360
Look at those.

02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:13.360
Look at those.

02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:14.360
All right.

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:18.680
Jim, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call.

02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:19.680
Don't be a stranger.

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:20.680
I'm glad to hear from you.

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:21.840
Listen, I'm glad to hear from you guys too.

02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:24.200
And I just want to say that I'm an angel.

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:26.200
Look at this light shining in my face.

02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:34.760
I'm coming down for Christmas time and I'm telling you be good to everybody you see because

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:42.520
I'm watching you and I got a big eye, you better look up, you better look up.

02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:43.520
All right.

02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:45.040
Before this turns into the Blair Witch Project.

02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:47.760
This Jim Sali call is brought to you by toothpicks.

02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:48.760
Who knows what's in them?

02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:49.760
All right.

02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:50.760
Take care, buddy.

02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:51.760
Love you, Rob Roberts.

02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:52.760
Love you, Loki.

02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:53.760
Love you, JB.

02:30:53.760 --> 02:31:03.320
I can tell my husband I kissed another man tonight.

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:09.920
I think video is going to have to be a requirement pretty soon as long as I'm not on it.

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:10.920
It's fine.

02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:11.920
We can point the camera over here.

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:12.920
All right.

02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:15.280
No, I think it was a toothpick.

02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:17.320
It was something or it was weed.

02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:18.320
I don't know.

02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:19.320
All right.

02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:21.360
I got more tweets.

02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:22.360
Who cares?

02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:24.400
Uh, let's see.

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:25.640
What am I looking at here?

02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:26.640
Uh, yes.

02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:29.960
This was the tweet that SSG100 Matt sent before that call.

02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:36.920
There's a lot here, but it had to do with RC cars on a track and let me see if I can

02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:37.920
open this.

02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:42.040
Actually, let me open this on the, um, this is why I should not use my iPad to do Twitter

02:31:42.040 --> 02:31:47.080
topics because then I don't have the YouTube hooked up to the stream.

02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:48.080
The tubes of you.

02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:49.080
I know, right?

02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:50.080
Uh, crap.

02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:56.640
No, it'll make a mess.

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:57.760
The joys of live radio.

02:31:57.760 --> 02:32:03.360
I'm logging in right now to the right Twitter account cause I, I'm have like four different

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:05.560
Twitter accounts.

02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:06.560
Let's go look at this.

02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:08.960
I wanted to look at the YouTube that was attached to this.

02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.760
Okay, here we go.

02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:20.720
What is this?

02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:24.600
This is Sega super circuit.

02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:30.920
You used deluxe outrun cabinets that allowed players to control an RC car on a large track

02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:37.400
that was set up next to the units and using cameras mounted to the cars.

02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:39.480
You got a first person view of your vehicle.

02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:41.640
That is the best thing ever.

02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:42.640
That's pretty awesome.

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:45.060
You know, Dan would flip his shit for this.

02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:46.060
This is 1989.

02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:48.240
I hope my God, look at the video.

02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:49.240
That is so adorable.

02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:50.240
Dude.

02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:53.040
That is completely flip his shit for this.

02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:54.040
Oh my God.

02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:56.920
That is so rad.

02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:02.040
And it keeps breaking up when the car runs into the wall.

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:03.100
That is cool.

02:33:03.100 --> 02:33:04.840
It's like you should link that to the listeners.

02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:11.840
You really can become a miniature person.

02:33:11.840 --> 02:33:12.840
I love that.

02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:15.440
Rob, I found a haiku from a friend of mine on tumblr.

02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:18.400
We're making Rama work overtime with the tumblr tonight, by the way.

02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:21.760
All the links I've been talking about during the show, I'm making Rama put on the tumblr.

02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:22.760
So check that out.

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:24.640
That is so cool.

02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:27.320
This is actually how I feel about group projects.

02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:29.120
So I'm going to read this haiku, Rob.

02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:30.120
Okay.

02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:31.120
I hate group projects.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:32.720
Just let me do it myself.

02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:35.520
Everyone else sucks.

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:39.320
Everyone else sucks.

02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:41.960
Haikus are easy, but sometimes they don't make sense.

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:45.920
Haiku does not take an S to make it plural.

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:50.680
Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion creator, Ron Gilbert, wants the game rights back, according

02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:53.800
to another tweet from SSJ100Matt.

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:54.800
Makes sense.

02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:57.560
I'm assuming this has to do with the whole Disney acquisition.

02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:02.640
Quote, yeah, I wish I owned Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion, you know.

02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:07.800
It just seems to be a company that hoards IP, and that kind of worries me.

02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:10.120
Doesn't think that he'll get those franchises back.

02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:11.120
Good luck, buddy.

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:12.320
Hope you...

02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:15.000
If they don't give them back to you, I hope it's because they're going to do something

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.480
with it, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:19.480
Well guess what?

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:20.480
You know what I just did?

02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:21.480
What's that?

02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:23.360
I signed up for a Mojang account.

02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:24.960
Uh oh.

02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:25.960
I'm not buying the game.

02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:26.960
Uh oh.

02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.960
I'm preparing for somebody else to buy me the game.

02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:29.200
You need to at least play the beta.

02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:30.680
All right.

02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:37.160
On the Tiger Claw tweets, hate using the classic controller on the Wii U?

02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:39.280
Use the PlayStation 2s instead.

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:42.400
Apparently there's a conversion kit that's going to be going on sale in Japan that will

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:45.760
allow you to connect a DualShock to the Wii U.

02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:49.000
You know, if you don't want to use the classic controller or what have you.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:50.000
The kit's from Datel.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.500
It'll cost about $25 or 1,980 yen.

02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:55.960
It goes on sale December 8th.

02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:57.960
No idea if this will be sold elsewhere.

02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:03.200
That's so cool that you would spend more money on a conversion kit than the actual controller.

02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.840
Six axis all the things.

02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:07.800
All right.

02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:08.800
Let's see.

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:15.360
And also from Tiger Claw, Miyamoto wonders, is story really necessary when gameplay will

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:16.840
do?

02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:20.960
Well, just based on title alone, I haven't even looked at the story.

02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:26.720
I think an ideal game has both, but Atari 2600 games, I guess, didn't really have a

02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:27.720
lot of story.

02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:29.640
Well, they did if you read the instruction manual.

02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:35.760
Sometimes you had to to visualize that stuff, but let's see.

02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:37.920
This is a link to a story from Gamasutra.

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.680
Again, I'm having to read this live because we just got linked to it on Twitter, but looking

02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:44.100
at the quote here from Miyamoto.

02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:49.280
With regard to the story, we did a survey over the Super Paper Mario game in Club Nintendo,

02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:52.300
and not even 1% said the story was interesting.

02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:56.740
A lot of people said that the flip move for switching between the 3D and the 2D dimensions

02:35:56.740 --> 02:35:58.580
was fun.

02:35:58.580 --> 02:35:59.780
Hmm.

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.300
Who's this?

02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:05.500
Taro Kudo, the creator of scenario design on the game said, quote, I didn't think we

02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:08.380
necessarily needed a lengthy story like in an RPG.

02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:12.060
Instead, we looked at the characteristics of a portable game that can be played little

02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:15.980
by little in small pieces and packed in lots of little episodes and ideas.

02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:19.540
I always did like putting in little ideas, so I actually enjoyed it.

02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:30.180
A good game doesn't need story, but you know, it's nice to have if the type of genre necessitates

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:31.180
it.

02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:35.740
Like, you know, a football game might not necessarily need story, but could a story

02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:37.140
make it more awesome?

02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:41.500
That's what makes wrestling games awesome, because it's like soap operas for broly dudes.

02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:47.580
And lastly, from Degenerate Johnny tonight, OLR, which is faster, running or rolling?

02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:51.940
Well, if you're a monk in World of Warcraft, rolling will give you a temporary speed boost

02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:54.100
if you spec the right talent for it.

02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:55.100
Dark.

02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:58.660
Depends if it's uphill or downhill.

02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:01.260
That's a good question.

02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:04.740
If it's a flat surface, I would think running is probably going to be a little faster.

02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:08.300
But yes, if you're going downhill, rolling might actually be more advantageous.

02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:10.060
And dangerous.

02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:11.380
Consider your terrain.

02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:12.500
Running and rolling.

02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:15.020
That was a Street Fighter Alpha 3 ending.

02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:17.660
All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:19.140
That's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight.

02:37:19.140 --> 02:37:21.220
Does that do it for Last Minute Stories as well?

02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:22.220
Yes.

02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:24.940
And that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:27.220
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show.

02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:29.700
We really appreciate your guys' support every single week.

02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:32.460
Yeah, I know it's a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but you know what?

02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:35.860
The last few have all been like three and a half hour epic episodes.

02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:40.940
So you know, a short one as the news is winding down for the year, I don't think is too bad.

02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:44.500
We are moving in, of course, to the year end in another year of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:49.660
And we couldn't have done it for the past coming up on 11 years without your support.

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:53.220
And you know, all we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:55.540
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:55.540 --> 02:37:59.800
Word of mouth is all we got, and it's worked out pretty well for us.

02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:03.340
Before we pull the plug on the show, it's time to go around and get everybody's final

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:04.860
thoughts tonight.

02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:05.860
I'll start.

02:38:05.860 --> 02:38:13.420
Our final thought tonight is, Fog of World is a very interesting app on the iPhone, but

02:38:13.420 --> 02:38:15.260
$5?

02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:19.100
Have I just been spoiled by all the 99 cent stuff that's available on IOS?

02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:21.100
I think $5 is a little much.

02:38:21.100 --> 02:38:23.180
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?

02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:27.300
I've decided that if I'm ever going to wear a watch again, it's going to be the Hello

02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:29.300
Kitty Nuka watch.

02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:32.420
Nuka makes awesome watches, just saying.

02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:36.620
And lastly but not leastly, Loki.

02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:40.660
I hope I get this stupid Mavarina plug-in working, because it's really frustrating me.

02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:43.340
It's giving me a headache.

02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:44.340
All right.

02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:46.140
That does it for another episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:49.300
We will be back to do it all again next week.

02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:53.140
And since we learned tonight that it is starting before the next show, happy Hanukkah to our

02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:55.060
listeners out there who celebrate it.

02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:56.060
Yep.

02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:57.060
Happy Hanukkah.

02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:58.060
There you go.

02:38:58.060 --> 02:38:59.060
Have a great week, everybody.

02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:00.300
We'll see you next time on Orange.

02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:01.300
Eat lots of latkes.

02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:03.260
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:04.260
Feed me gelt.

02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:05.260

02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:06.260
