00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, December 2nd, 2012, a new Wii console is unveiled, a classic console is reborn on iPhone and iPad, and could Sony be planning a break apart controller for the next Playstation?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December 2nd, 2012, episode number 484.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about the latest and greatest in the gaming world and some other things too with my co-hosts. First off, say hello to the one and only Dark Soccer Hour, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How are you, Jamie Summers?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Doing alright.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah? What's new with you? Hanukkah's coming up real quick, isn't it?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, I think it starts the 9th. Yeah, so I've got a...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Wait, are you going to be here next week if it starts the 9th? We better figure that out.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I need to find out if the temple is having something. Well, I'll verify the dates and...

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm glad I thought to ask.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, no, because usually my temple does something for the first in whatever, you know, Shabbat is during Hanukkah.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Right.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I'd have to find out. But I mean, I'm already getting out my little... I have this thing I got at Target of all places that's like little felt candles and you can put them up on this banner.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm already getting some of the decorations out of all places. The grocery outlet had six pointed blue Christmas ornaments.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I was like, I'm going to use these.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why not?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, so hooray.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All right. We'll also say hello to Tech Master Loki joining us here in studio.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How are you, Loki?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm fine.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
McDonald's again during the show. Is that like...

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's cheap.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's like your standard thing now.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, it's cheap and I was over there running errands.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, OK.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Not at McDonald's but in the plaza with McDonald's.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I need a Big Mac. Stat.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right. What else is new with you?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now I'm still trying to fix the Minecraft server, trying to get this one plug-in mob arena to work correctly.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And I fixed... There was an error in the config file. I fixed that. It's still not accepting any of the commands though.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I have to look at the permissions again because I took the new permission program out and put the old one back in because I figured, OK, it was just this config file that was broken.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so now I have to get that to work and if it doesn't work with this one and I have to try the new config or the new permissions file again.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's just this one plug-in is just being a pain in the ass. So, I don't know.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Correct me if I'm wrong but I think I read something on the Twitters or something about Josh's first gaming experience or something like that or you're trying to breed him a little more as a gamer?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Not his first gaming experience, but no, he wanted to hit the buttons on the arcade cabinet. So we put it on. I turned it on and put Bubble Bubble on and he wants to hit the buttons.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He likes hitting the button to make the bubbles blow from the dinosaur.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's how we started. Does anyone remember? Does anyone in the studio maybe remember like what turned them on to video games in the first place?

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Like I know you have to have like a really young memory for most of us because I know most of us started in like the Coleco Atari era or whatever.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Does anybody remember? Like for me, I think like I don't remember a lot being a kid but I think the fact that I could control what was on the television like besides just the remote but like I could actually like make my own TV show of sorts was kind of what turned me on to gaming.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't remember what it was exactly.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For the record, Hanukkah starts on the 8th so I was right in general as far as daytime goes. But there's nothing going on so I'll be here.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, phew, just checking.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll let my candle before I go.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because if I needed a guest host, I like to know that stuff in advance.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I mean unless you just want to give me the night off, I don't know.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can take a night off, just let me know.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Alright, also say hello to the ever-present fourth guest on our show, The Chatters. You can participate live with us at live.vognetwork.com.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern or thereabouts right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I say thereabouts because sometimes his show runs a little long and that's okay because he's always kind enough to have us on at the end and we do this little like tease across.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So if you've never listened to Bobby's show before, you're missing a little kind of bonus segment with us for lack of a better term at the end of his show every week.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And it's a good show. Like the other 50 minutes of the show are great too. He's one guy talking about games.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I just like to give him a nice little plug there every now and then. And you can check out all the great shows that make up the lineup of The Voice of Geek Network at vognetwork.com.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Again, that's vognetwork.com. Other great shows, Pod Culture, Girls Gone Wow, lots of stuff and hopefully new stuff next year. Who knows? We'll see.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Also in the chat room, AcidicVampire in our chat room says, after you were introduced DarkSakura, AcidicVampire said,

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mrs. Vicarian, I don't know about this because thanks to the Omega DLC this week, you might be going for girls this time, right?

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, she's dead, so I mean...

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't spoil! Oh my gosh!

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh my God!

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:41,000
She's only in the DLC, I'll put it that way. So it's only a moment. And I just appreciate it. Clearly she has still some residual going on for Miss Aria.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, there is a little bit of tension going on there, isn't there?

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My favorite line, I love it when you're feisty. Wink!

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
AcidicVampire has changed the line to Mrs. Candrose. There you go.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, no, Vicarian.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You know what this is going to turn into? This is going to turn into a freaking TV series like they have with Grey's Anatomy or something like that.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Where it's going to be on a starship and it's just going to be drama and people sleeping with each other.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Because that's all that Mass Effect is really. That and a third person shooter.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, is that a problem?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, those shows suck.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'd say it's more like The Walking Dead because I think there's a lot of people that weren't listening to Bobby tonight because The Walking Dead is on at the same time on the East Coast.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It has zombies in it. I mean, this is like drama.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, Mass Effect has aliens in it. Alright, look.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And grunt.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Moving on. I actually, I will say this. We're going to get into our gaming week soon enough. I will say this.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just to make Loki happy with my fandom coming full circle, I did place my order, my $60 order for the Mass Effect trilogy on Playstation 3.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Which will be shipped the day the game is launched.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, now it's complete.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That means the only system I don't have it on now is Wii U.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But I'm going to, I'm holding off on that until they fix some of the DLC.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Which I do need to issue an errata.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You know, heaven forbid we ever misspeak on Orange Launch Radio and I say something wrong.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But I did last week. I said that none of the multiplayer DLC was available on Mass Effect 3 Wii U.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That is incorrect. It does include the first three multiplayer download packs.

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But I believe it is missing this most recent one still.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It is still missing something that the other consoles have.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But it's still lame. The options that you're not allowed to carry over.

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, well that's a whole other thing.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Which people will get to hear once a certain podcast is available.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Get careful. I'll have you taken out and back and roughed up too like a chatter who was trying to spoil it earlier.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But what was I going to say about all that?

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know if this is just rumor or fan wank or what.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But supposedly Mass Effect 3 Wii U is selling better than BioWare had anticipated.

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So they are looking at, I mean I guess that kind of stuff is always a possibility.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We only thought we'd sell a copy and we sold two.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Who knows? Who knows?

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. I want to do a kickoff topic real quick.

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's been very stormy here in Northern California over the past few days. It's just finally cleared up.

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You call this a storm?

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, for us yes. I do call it a storm. It is very much a storm for Northern California.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Because our part of the land is not built to handle the same types of weather as other parts.

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But anyway.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This land is your land.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm just saying it's been flooding everywhere. I'm surprised you guys didn't drive through flooded streetways to get here.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But yeah, it's been pretty crazy. I don't know about you guys but on nights like these I like to stay in and play video games.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So like over this stormy season are there any games that you're looking forward to catching up on?

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Things you're trying to play over the next month or so?

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know for me I have a huge backlog of games on Steam that I've really got to get through.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And that doesn't even count the Mass Effect trilogy.

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But I've also got some games coming in from my rental service.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm going to give Forza a try because some of our VoG fans have been talking about it.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And whatever else they end up sending me.

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So I don't know. Is there any catch up games?

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Like things, Loki, you were talking about before the show.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Like I have all these games I haven't even touched.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well yeah, it's because I just remembered to go through.

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'd actually had, I was adding all my Steam codes for the humble bundles I have and stuff.

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like past ones.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Like there's some that I haven't even redeemed yet.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And most of them I have not played yet.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And even the stuff from like the last Summer Sale or whatever.

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Most of the games that I've bought there I have not played.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So I have a ton of games I could be playing.

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And then on top of that, just the stuff that I did buy and played a little bit of on console.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That I still have to play more and more Minecraft.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So I got plenty of stuff to keep me busy.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Jim Sally in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Actually Rob, Walking Dead is on now on the East Coast and I'm skipping it for you.

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I guess apparently it's on at 9.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well thank you guys for skipping that show to come be with us.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's why they invented DVR and Hulu and other ways to watch TV shows later on.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Even though I have yet to watch any Walking Dead.

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not hating on it.

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I hardly watch any TV shows unless it's RuPaul's Drag Race.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Or Happy Endings actually.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I strangely like that show.

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's weird. Anyway.

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Dark Sakura, anything that you're trying to catch up on?

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well I've been trying to get my newly purchased copy of Sonic Generations to download.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because I've really wanted to play that game.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I got it way cheap on Steam.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I love Steam.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm playing that stupid Faerie Solitaire game.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Because I want to beat it this year.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But other than that, I got another game that just looks so cool to me.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And it had been kind of on my radar for a little bit.

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But I finally just broke down and bought it.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a game called Closure.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I haven't played it yet.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Where it's basically all black and white.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And it uses the light to create your area around you.

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So basically wherever the light shines, it exists.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If the light isn't shining there, it doesn't exist.

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Meaning you can create holes in the ground and drop down into other levels.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And it's a really neat application of physics.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So it's been on my radar for a little while and I've wanted to play it.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So I finally just downloaded it.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Other than that, I'm playing my usual.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There you go.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I touched WoW.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It liked it.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You pretty much just did your gaming week together with the question, didn't you?

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, because a lot of it's combined.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've downloaded the stuff, I've prepped it.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Now it just doesn't matter sitting down and playing it.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You were talking a little bit about Project Greenlight stuff before the show.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is that something you've been participating with?

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm looking to see what the new stuff coming in is and if it interests me or not.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I've watched the trailers for a few things and I was like, eh, crap.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It just hasn't interested me.

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I've got like one thing.

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Not every idea is something you're going to jump up and go woo at.

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But there's some good things on there.

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I've been poking around in there too.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But the other thing going on is that I want to hook up the Dreamcast.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And actually I've had this urge to play through Grandia 2 again.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So I'm thinking about playing it.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or the SNES and playing through Earthbound.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, I was thinking about revisiting some classics too.

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't know.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I thought it would be fun to get one of those little streaming things for the TV

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and do a little streaming session of a game.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And that's something I've been talking about for forever.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And it's one of those new media things that we've completely missed the boat on.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You know what we should do?

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We should actually play through Secret of Mana.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It would be fun.

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
O2 player?

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why not?

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why not?

197
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't even know if I've beaten that game.

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think I got all the way to the end.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I don't think I've ever actually beaten it.

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I have beaten it.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Same thing with Secret of Evermore.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Go figure.

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You and secrets, Rob.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well I have a whole week off from Christmas to New Year.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And I was originally going to go to Vegas.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But that probably isn't happening.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I'm going to have all this time and nothing to do.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So we'll see.

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
All right.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Since we got into our gaming weeks already, Loki, why don't you go next?

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
How was your gaming week?

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This week I played Black Ops 2 a bit more.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We finally finished up playing all the multiplayer maps.

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And now we're just kind of going back and playing whatever we want to play.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I finished the single player campaign, which actually ended kind of short.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It was starting to get really good.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And then it's like, and done.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's like that one that they were showing kind of in all the trailers and stuff where all the drones are attacking L.A. and that kind of thing.

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's the second to last mission of the game.

220
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And so right after that, it's like, oh, we're going to attack where the source is coming from.

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And game over.

222
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's like, okay, that was interesting.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And I guess there's multiple endings to the game.

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But, dude, I don't even know, like, all the different things that you do in the game.

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There's only like a, it must have been like three, maybe two second clip.

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's like something happens and then I guess that changes based on how you play the game.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So, woohoo, a five second clip that I, you know, affected by playing the game differently in different spots.

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't know. It's just kind of weird.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't know if, I probably wouldn't go back and replay through all the campaign again.

230
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But it was fun the first time.

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's just, I wish it was longer because it was actually pretty cool.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And it was getting really good and then just like, done.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We're done with that.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Also played Far Cry 3.

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That game is fantastic.

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And, you know, playing through the single player campaign of that.

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Very cinematic.

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You know, I love the detail in the jungle.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I mean, it's pretty awesome for like even a console game.

240
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Reminds me a lot of like Just Cause 2.

241
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Just, you know, the locale and everything.

242
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And even the AI is kind of stupid sometimes.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Which is kind of fun.

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I like that.

245
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I also like how chaotic everything is with, you know, you'll be going up to attack somebody.

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And all of a sudden they get eaten by a tiger or something.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's just, you know, oh hey, there's a tiger there.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's unusual.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But one of the fun things I like doing with it is, you know, you can hunt animals in the game.

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And it's kind of an exploit, I guess.

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But the animals can't attack you in a car.

252
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So you just drive over the animal with the car.

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, we got to hunt a tiger because it's very dangerous.

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hit it with the car!

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Peeta's calling and telling you to stop.

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Peeta can bite my ass.

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's fantastic.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's like, oh, you know, you're trying to kill me.

259
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You know, I'm going to shoot at you.

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Get you to run back towards me.

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hop in my car and hit you with the car.

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Or, you know, the same thing with Komodo dragons.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Like, they'll just gang up on you and just boop, boop, back and forth.

264
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And they're dead.

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And they'll collect their skins.

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Or even better is that you get these animals to chase after you.

267
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They run back to, like, one of the outposts that you've taken over.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And your men kill them.

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Or you can hang out at one of those outposts where, like, these animals are normally.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And they'll just keep spawning and your men will keep killing them and you just loot everything.

271
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Even if one of the guys dies, you just loot him.

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's fantastic.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I just love manipulating all that stuff.

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And it's a pretty interesting storyline.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I went through one of the first, like, kind of drug trip moments in the game.

276
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That was interesting.

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I really like the way they did it, though.

278
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It was pretty cool.

279
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And let's see what else.

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
A little bit of Minecraft.

281
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Still trying to get this damn plug in the work.

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And it's been pissing me off.

283
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But just some reminder stuff.

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We've got, you know, it's at vog-minecraft.com to check out.

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Right now it's just a dynamic map.

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But eventually, once I get everything working on the server, I'm going to actually...

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm going to load that site and hope it doesn't break the show as it loads.

288
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It shouldn't break the show.

289
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's not that bad.

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Wow.

291
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It looks like the map has even expanded more since the last time I checked.

292
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's possible.

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We've been still trying to...

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We've been running into some things that are not working because I'm loading in so many plugins.

295
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like certain...

296
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I think it's a lot of the craft book stuff was just causing things to not work right.

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Because they have different blocks that make the mine cart do different things.

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And so some of them weren't stopping.

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Or my whole roller coaster thing stopped working because all the blocks that made up the roller coaster were actually the reverse direction blocks in that plugin.

300
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So that was kind of fun.

301
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I haven't logged into Minecraft in forever.

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sorry, you guys.

303
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Nah, no one has.

304
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I see Hitstun talking about it in the VoG thread.

305
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, he does.

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He does.

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But...

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We need to set a night.

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.

310
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This is a Minecraft orgy night, but not like an actual orgy.

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I wanted to do that, but eventually we'll get there.

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Right now, like I said, I'm trying to set up this arena.

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Because I know I've got everything in there and it's pretty awesome.

314
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I just need to get that actual hit off the ground.

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But yeah, you can go to VoG-Minecraft.com for the 3D map and you can actually poke around and see what people are building and stuff.

316
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And you can actually see people when they're in-game.

317
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And I think you can even chat with them too through that window, which is kind of neat.

318
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I gotta ask you about this since you're a Minecraft fan and all the listeners as well.

319
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Because I'm sure a lot of the listeners that we have would not have seen this, but it's really funny.

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I actually found this on Reddit on the gamers community.

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Have you ever heard of this app that they have on the iPhone called a grinder?

322
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Have you ever heard of that?

323
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's kind of like a friend finder, but a lot of people use it for more than friends, if you know what I'm saying, right?

324
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
A lot of people do that.

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Well, somebody set up this profile on there called Steve.

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And they actually have a picture of Steve from Minecraft.

327
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It says, no creepers, please.

328
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hello, my name is Steve. I like to go mining in caves and crafting things on my workbench.

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
My favorite food is cookies.

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So somebody messages him out of the blue.

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Hi, sexy. Lovely blue eyes. Like the sea.

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And they send a picture.

333
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Any other pictures for me there, sexy?

334
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And Steve replies back, hello, sir. How are you?

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes, I have many a picture for you.

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And sends back a picture with the pig and the lamb, like from the game.

337
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like these are game screenshots.

338
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Like you can't mistake this for a video game.

339
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And the guy replies back, so very handsome indeed.

340
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you live on a farm?

341
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And Steve replies, I move around a lot.

342
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I often have to quickly build shelter out of dirt and cobblestone before sunset.

343
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And the guy replies back, so you're a handyman.

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You must be quite fit too then.

345
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Are you into older men?

346
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Another picture perhaps.

347
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And so another in-game picture comes back and says, you know, I can outrun skeletons and zombies.

348
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And the guy like doesn't get it.

349
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Wanna meet?

350
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And so Steve replies, okay, have you got any redstone for a compass?

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What are your X and Z coordinates?

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And the guy goes, I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And so the guy replies back with a picture of a compass.

354
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, obviously the guy's trolling.

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He's hella trolling, but it's funny that the guy's fallen for, poor guy.

356
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't think he's falling for it. I mean, come on.

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't see how anyone can be that stupid.

358
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You never know. You never know.

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Unless, you know, unless he's like.

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This guy probably knows nothing about.

361
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Unless he's like visually impaired or something like that.

362
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And so his, you know, computer or whatever is reading back the text.

363
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And he doesn't, doesn't realize that it's, you know, a picture of a, you know.

364
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I have a question though.

365
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Like, can you decide who, uh, uh, like what your character looks like?

366
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

367
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay, good.

368
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You can completely draw.

369
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Even though I don't own the camera.

370
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes, I play as Zangief.

371
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let me link that in chat. There you go.

372
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
See if you want to see that for yourself there.

373
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, so.

374
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay, someone did the best thing on Tumblr.

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They took Garris and Tali and put them in, um, a horse drawn carriage and then had, uh, Gordon Freeman decorating a tree.

376
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You and your fandom need to stop derailing the show. Yes, Loki?

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, one of the other things I saw an article about how to render like, you know, Minecraft worlds and stuff like that to like pretty awesome 3D images.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So probably do that too at some point.

379
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Maybe on the website once, you know, like I said, once I get this stupid plug in the work.

380
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Then it'll be all gravy, but it's just right now, it's just refusing to accept any of the commands I put into it.

381
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's just like, nope, no thanks, sorry, not going to do that.

382
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Um, so I just have to figure out why.

383
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's something with the permissions now because I got the config file working correctly, I think.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So, I don't know, we'll figure it out eventually.

385
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Um, and then also I played, uh, was it, uh, SkillRex?

386
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Um, or Skrillex, I guess?

387
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The, uh, Legend of Skrillex or whatever the hell that game was.

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's some like Skrillex game.

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh yeah, I think that's a news item later.

390
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah, but it's pretty awesome.

391
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's, uh...

392
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Really? Skrillex? Awesome?

393
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, the game's awesome. I think it was kind of cool.

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I mean, it's a little bit like Zelda and stuff, but it's done by the same guy that did the, um, Perfect Strangers game.

395
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, okay.

396
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Does it have Belki in it?

397
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That game was pretty fucking rad.

398
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

399
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Alright, I give it a pass then.

400
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, that was it.

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Alright, uh, My Gaming Week. Not a lot of new stuff.

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Uh, Warcraft got a big patch this week, so I was playing a lot of that because, you know, there's upgrades to go for and, uh, things from my other show, Horde House.

403
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Um, I did play some more, uh, Wii U.

404
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I played more Super Mario Brothers U, or what, a new Super Mario Brothers U.

405
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Um, I haven't beat it yet, but I'm getting really close.

406
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I think I'm on the last level before the castle level, so...

407
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And then I hear once you beat it, like any Mario game, it's gonna have, you know, all new stuff.

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And I know, I already know these exits have multiple levels and shit, so I'm having a good time with it.

409
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's, it's fun.

410
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Uh, also on the Wii U, I did download something new.

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Uh, I decided to kind of try out the process of a download title, and so I wanted to download one that looked interesting to me.

412
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So I checked out Mighty Switch Force Hyper Drive Edition.

413
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Uh, first I gotta say, though, again with the whole Nintendo LOL online part, not the most fun to try and download.

414
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Well, I don't know. I guess it was a step above the Wii.

415
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You go in, you fill out your information, you can at least use the little touch pad, which makes it faster, whatever.

416
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And it will download in the background while you play other games, but if you turn your system off, the download stops.

417
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Unless you go into download management and say, power off my system when the downloads are done.

418
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Like, it's not really proactive about it, so I kind of learned that the hard way.

419
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Alright, so whatever. I had to wait for the download.

420
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Once the thing was finally done downloading, it took four minutes to install.

421
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Like, what are you doing where you just downloaded the whole, now what are you doing for four minutes to install a game that's only half a gig?

422
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, but the PS3 does the same thing.

423
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's not as bad, though. Like, PS3, 60 seconds tops for a download game.

424
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Four minutes on the Wii U? I don't know.

425
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Well, it must be that underclocked CPU that they rumored to have in that system.

426
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, it was a little clunky, so I was not a fan of that.

427
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But whatever, I mean, it's not the worst thing I've ever experienced.

428
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And again, that's not a slam on the game, that's just, you know, I was trying to see what the Wii U download experience would be like.

429
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I was like, alright, well that's different.

430
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But the game itself is fun. It's a pretty simple, well I shouldn't say simple because that makes it sound bad, but the premise is pretty simplistic.

431
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It plays like a little platformer. I guess they had a version of this on the 3DS in the download shop, but I never played it.

432
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Which lends itself fabulously to Loki's whole theory about all your DS games are going to come out on Wii U, just wait.

433
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But what was cool about this is that, you know, you can either play with the action going on on the TV and like a little radar on your Wii U pad along with the lives and all that.

434
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Or you can hit a button and have the whole game on the pad.

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So I like those games where you kind of have the option to do one or the other.

436
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But the game itself, you're trying to find these five prisoners in a level, and they're all anime babes.

437
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You're trying to find these prisoners in a level and you have like jump, shoot, and switch.

438
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And the switch will make blocks appear and disappear.

439
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And it's either like one way or the other way. There's only like two configurations.

440
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But then it gets more complicated where the blocks might actually be like launchers from like Sonic the Hedgehog that'll like make you fire in a certain direction.

441
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And then you have to use these bomb enemies, put them in the launchers to explode blocks across the page.

442
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You know, just kind of like a puzzle platformer.

443
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But I like those type of games, so it's fun.

444
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It looks like there's only about 20 levels, though.

445
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But it's already getting, like you're really having to think like even as early as like stage four or five.

446
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AlphaKnanagram wants to say about Mighty Switch Force in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

447
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The thing is, Mighty Switch Force wasn't a DS-ish game.

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It mainly just used the top screen so it could come out on the Vita.

449
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And that's very true. You can play the whole game on the touchpad only.

450
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So you can do the game all on one screen.

451
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The second screen enhances it, and I use that term very loosely, with the whole radar.

452
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Which is a neat thing, but it's not necessary to the game.

453
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And I'm okay with that because I don't think the 3DS, or ex-

454
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The Wii U.

455
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I mean the same thing, I mean.

456
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I don't think the Wii U should whore that second screen too much because you're not physically capable of seeing two screens at once.

457
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Unless it's one of those Nintendo Land games where you hold the thing up to the TV and like the little ninja game or things like that.

458
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Like there's some games that are built that way, but most of the gaming experiences aren't built like that.

459
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So I'm okay with the second screen being like informational.

460
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Glance down here occasionally.

461
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
A sub-screen that you don't have to hit the button to switch to.

462
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Like I think that's an okay use of it.

463
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:38,000
AlphaKananagram also wants to point out that Mighty Flip Champs, which is kind of like a cousin series also by WayForward, did come out on the PSP.

464
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Maybe it was a PS Mini.

465
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Anyhow, I like the game. It's a $10 game.

466
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's where most of the Wii U downloads seem to be priced. It's around 10-15 bucks.

467
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I thought it was-

468
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I didn't sit there going, I wasted my money on this experiment.

469
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I was like, oh this game is kind of fun and I would play this again.

470
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It would be really awesome if I could like beam it to my 3DS and have it on the go, but I know that's asking a lot of Nintendo.

471
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Anyway.

472
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

473
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So before we get into the news, quickly some plugs.

474
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Of course follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

475
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And you can also follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

476
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We are on Google Plus as well under Orange Lounge Radio.

477
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I want to plug our mailbag. You can always send us emails. We'll get to those in the second half of the show.

478
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

479
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And again, please help us support all indie podcasts.

480
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I always like to just plug all indie podcasts and the hard people.

481
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You know, the hard working people behind producing these shows.

482
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And especially the ones on the Voice of the Geeks Network.

483
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Voggenetwork.com. Especially those shows.

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news. Loki.

485
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So holy crap, Nintendo announces another system.

486
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But except it's only for Canadian. I know it's Canada.

487
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Wii Mini. And what Wii Mini is is a really small version of the Wii that lacks a lot of things.

488
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Including SD card support. Wi-Fi support. Or actually any internet connection support.

489
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And yeah. It's basically just if you want to play games.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And that is it. Some games.

491
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But it's pretty. It's pretty small. And I kind of like the way it looks.

492
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I mean, it looks like it's got a top loader disk drive to it.

493
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And it's red. Well at least it's black with red trim on it.

494
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And the controllers that come with it are red.

495
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's going to be available December 7th for $99.99. I'm assuming that's Canadian.

496
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And also not compatible with GameCube disks. But most of the Wii's nowadays are not.

497
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So that's not a big surprise.

498
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah. So game system. Red nunchuck. Red Wiimote Plus.

499
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And sensor bar. Power adapter. And composite cable. For $99.99.

500
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Pretty cool looking.

501
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Lots of people on there. I'm surprised you're speaking as nicely of this as you are.

502
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Lots of people on the interwebs. Don't get it. Why this? You're pushing the Wii U.

503
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What the hell is this about?

504
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This is one of the price points down really low. And I think they figured a lot of people.

505
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's be honest. Their online was kind of eh. I mean it was alright.

506
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You can download virtual console games and stuff like that.

507
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well obviously you can't do that now. You can't download any DLC or any downloads whatsoever with this.

508
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But I mean they had that kind of in place where not a lot of people were probably utilizing it.

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Especially like grandpa and grandma are probably not downloading virtual console games.

510
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They probably don't even know how to do that.

511
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So this is more trying to get into I guess those places where people are looking for a cheap gaming system.

512
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You know they haven't jumped into this. And maybe you get hooked on this and you'll buy something else.

513
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Although it's kind of weird to see this coming out so late because there's really not a whole lot of Wii games coming out.

514
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like you know if this was something that they were introducing towards the end of the life cycle.

515
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Not like literally at you know eleven fifty nine of the clock you know Wii.

516
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I mean it's pretty much done here. But there's already a gigantic library out there.

517
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I mean it's not there's like a lack of Wii software.

518
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah that's true. But I mean I don't think that they would want to try building up there.

519
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's kind of like what they did remember with the PSP. They had like a PSP version or whatever with no Wi-Fi and stuff.

520
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And it was supposed to be really cheap. I just I don't know. It's kind of weird that they put that out.

521
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But it's a little weird but I get it. I mean I do get it.

522
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And I think the thing we have to remember is that if you're listening to this show chances are very strongly this console was not for you.

523
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Like if you have if you're listening to this show and you haven't bought a Wii by now.

524
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I don't think like Nintendo was going to win you over. And this really wasn't meant for you.

525
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This is really just for people who want you know oh I've always wanted Wii Sports but oh it's only $99 now.

526
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Maybe I'll get it now. Or you know a real cheap alternative to have in the kids room.

527
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And the fact that it doesn't have internet actually is a great selling point for parents who might be trying to control you know very heavily what their kids are doing.

528
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
There's a lot of households that want to lock that down. Maybe not the type again that are listening to this show.

529
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But I just think you know this is just for a different type of audience obviously and I think most people are figuring that out.

530
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,000
But it's weird that it's only coming out in Canada. Like is it a test market thing?

531
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I think it's a test market because if you think about it they don't want to mass produce these things and have them not sell.

532
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So these are just a mass producing for one market and then that way if it's a flop you're not stuck with millions of these or probably not millions but hundreds of thousands of them.

533
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You're only stuck with you know a few thousands instead.

534
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Also something to consider it's not completely unheard of for Nintendo to do this thing well after the other console has started.

535
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Like I believe correct me if I'm wrong but those top loader NES's came out like right when the Super Nintendo's were already coming out.

536
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And then I think the Super Nintendo got a remake as well when the 64's came out.

537
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't remember if the 64's got a remake around GameCube but you still had like the Pokemon 64 and there were some other little remodels that came out you know relatively late in the life.

538
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And then GameCube.

539
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
PS2 did the same thing and PS1 yeah.

540
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Right right.

541
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So I mean well those see even with Sony though that tends to happen kind of like mid-cycle.

542
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Nintendo's always done it very late.

543
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So this whole Wii mini it's not unheard of.

544
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's like the DSi XL you know.

545
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's weird that they're taking some of the features away but I guess if they want to get at that bargain basement price and you know maybe they're trying to see.

546
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Maybe they think somebody who wants internet in their device ought to just get a Wii U.

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
ActDeft asks does the mini come with Wii Sports though?

548
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
No it comes with nothing.

549
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Interesting.

550
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So remember none of the systems sell with Wii Sports anymore.

551
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They actually well I mean they have a bundle with one but they've got it being sold separately now for 20 bucks.

552
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
How easy though is it to get like a copy of Wii Sports at GameStop for probably like five bucks.

553
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah.

554
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Or EB Canada or whatever they have up there you know.

555
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So anyway.

556
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah I mean obviously it's not something I would pick up anytime soon.

557
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's neat but I kind of want to see someone hack this apart you know to add all those features back in.

558
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Well I mean you know an SD card slot might be kind of nice.

559
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But I mean if they had an SD card slot you could buy that and then.

560
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
What would you use the SD card slot for when there's no internet?

561
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You use it for loading the homebrew channel and then all the x-rays that go along with it.

562
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay there you go.

563
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Alright VX Jason XV in our chat says the GameCube wasn't remodeled but there was the Panasonic Cube.

564
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think that was only in Japan and again that wasn't a late cycle thing that was actually really early on wasn't it.

565
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah Panasonic Cube was pretty early.

566
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So that was I always kind of wanted one of those.

567
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Not anymore.

568
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Expensive for just a DVD player.

569
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I remember seeing them in I think in Japantown in LA we would see them.

570
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They were like $700 or something crazy like that.

571
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So yeah I wasn't going to be getting one anytime soon.

572
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Alright moving on to a story about something that's been kind of controversial and on a lot of blogs and so forth this week.

573
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It is a new Humble Bundle but this one's got some people raising their eyebrows because it's the Humble THQ Bundle.

574
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So it's no longer the Humble Indie Bundle it's now selling THQ games.

575
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
However there's still the charity you can split the money between THQ charity and the Humble Bundle website tip.

576
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You can give all your money to one or the other you know you can adjust the sliders just like any of the previous packs.

577
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It comes with the soundtracks for all the games as well.

578
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Here's the other sticking point for a lot of people.

579
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
These games are only available on Windows Steam.

580
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And in Canada. I'm kidding.

581
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
No don't start lies.

582
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
No no no.

583
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But they're only available on Windows Steam because THQ has imported these games to Linux or things like that and I guess they don't have plans to.

584
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And the Steam part means there is DRM and the Humble Bundle usually doesn't have DRM.

585
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Usually you can get a Steam key to load the games in Steam which is what a lot of people do that's what I do.

586
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But you can also once you've bought a bundle you have a key that works forever that you can go into the site and just download the game on a whim.

587
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
If I wanted to I could go to a friend's house download the game install it and you know it would never know.

588
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I mean with the Humble Bundle being open and pay what you want you're not supposed to really do that but if you want to it's there.

589
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But there's a lot of people that are I don't want to say they're saying that the Humble Bundle is selling out but I'm looking at a story on the Penny Arcade report that says it is a step backward.

590
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't get it.

591
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And it's not that like I have some I actually usually really respect in particular the Penny Arcade report and don't mishear me I'm not saying I don't respect him over this story.

592
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I mean we always are welcome to having difference of opinion this is why we you know have the internet in the first place.

593
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But I was I kind of had a little bit of a frown at this story because I was like this reads like gamer entitlement in a way to me.

594
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And I was really disappointed.

595
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Doesn't make any sense either because you would think that you know this is basically a way for the Humble Bundle guys to kind of get a little bit more traffic on their site.

596
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And if anything it's still more money being thrown at Child's Play Charities something I would think that Penny Arcade would be kind of okay for you know hey it's more donations for Child's Play potentially.

597
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I mean granted it's okay some THQ games not necessarily indie games but they're not calling it an indie bundle they're calling it the THQ bundle.

598
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
They never said you know on the site that we're only going to do indie games they just this is what they've been offering so far.

599
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't buy it if you don't like it.

600
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Again this is from the Penny Arcade report I'm going to read a little quote here quote.

601
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Indies have been replaced by a single big name studio DRM is back and the variety of platforms supported has been shrunk.

602
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This isn't a Humble Bundle it's a Steam Sale.

603
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
No it's not a Steam Sale you can't donate all your money to a Steam Sale to charity.

604
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's a huge difference a huge difference for a lot of people there.

605
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You can't also pay what you want on a Steam Sale.

606
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That's right you still have to pay some sort of price there on a Steam Sale.

607
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I get the whole it stinks because they don't support all of the platforms.

608
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That's the part I'm kind of with them at but at the same token I'm like well this is better than nothing at all.

609
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And who said the Humble Bundle has to deliver something all the time.

610
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I see the Humble Bundle quite frankly as gifts to the industry.

611
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Pay what you want donate to charity lots of great games that's a freaking gift to the industry.

612
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Why are we feeling entitled?

613
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That's bad that's really bad and it just made it kind of disappointed me that websites like this that I'm like 99% of the time like I'm with your brother.

614
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Went down this road Ars Technica another one that wrote a piece that was very critical of it and I read that side all the time.

615
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I think it's a great site.

616
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Good for page hits.

617
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I guess that's true.

618
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says this isn't the EA Indie Bundle.

619
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Ain't that the truth.

620
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That was a thing easy.

621
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You know making a joke there on something that was real very tongue in cheek there.

622
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I honestly I think that actually even though it's DRM and only limited platform.

623
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
As an experiment it's a good idea because I mean it's a way for a company to.

624
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I mean basically all these donations are tax write offs anyway whatever they don't make on whatever the retail price of the game is is going to count as a tax write off as a charitable donation.

625
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But it's a way to encourage people to give to those who need it.

626
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
The story goes on to make a point about how the bundle will not help the people that actually made the games in this case.

627
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because a lot of the THQ employees have been laid off since the time this bundle came out.

628
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Or I mean since the time these games originally came out.

629
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And I'm kind of like alright I get that.

630
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
That sucks but A THQ is kind of desperate right now.

631
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And for what I you know their stock is in the toilet that's no secret.

632
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
We've had a lot of grim stories about them lately.

633
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
My understanding is they went to the humble bundle with this idea.

634
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And I think with desperate times call for desperate measures.

635
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And you've got to do something radical to save your company.

636
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Or there won't be any THQ games in the future.

637
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And I kind of I applaud the fact that they're taking a risk.

638
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And this is a risk around for everybody and I kind of wish more gaming companies would take risks.

639
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And it seems to be paying off what three million dollars raised not necessarily all for THQ.

640
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But you figure THQ even if they've got a half million of that.

641
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Has making way more money than they probably were off these games at this point anyway.

642
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And let's be honest I mean they have steam sales all the time.

643
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like you know Saints Row the Third is always being marked down to like ten bucks fifteen bucks or whatever.

644
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That's kind of really what I wanted to buy it anyways.

645
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I mean yeah cool donate money to everything.

646
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But yeah I just wanted Saints Row the Third.

647
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Six bucks is a pretty good price for Saints Row the Third.

648
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And I get Red Faction Armageddon which was awesome.

649
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And also you know Metro 2033.

650
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And the other games.

651
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And Darksiders.

652
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I mean that's just icing on the cake for me.

653
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So what?

654
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I don't hate the fact that I got a good deal on those games.

655
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And the hate on steam for having steam sales in I guess.

656
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I mean I don't know why people were just hating on it at all.

657
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I gave well over the average actually.

658
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I give a bit over the average to get the pack just because I wanted to support it.

659
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I kind of wanted to offset some of the negativity I saw on the internet.

660
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And I donated the vast majority of it to charity.

661
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I gave THQ a dollar and I gave a dollar for the tip.

662
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You know because you should always give a dollar to something you support.

663
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But I gave the rest to charity.

664
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I gave it all to charity.

665
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Well and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

666
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Also one more thing I want to read out of this story.

667
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And again I don't mean to be picking on this but this is just one of those things that I don't get it.

668
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Like I think this guy just had a moment of weakness or something or I don't know.

669
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Again from the penny arcade report.

670
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm going to be a hypocrite and buy a bundle.

671
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Just because these are incredible games at a staggering low price.

672
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But wouldn't it have been something if they were offered without DRM?

673
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Or if they ran on Linux?

674
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Or if the space was used to promote games that hadn't already sold millions of copies?

675
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah that would have been something.

676
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But it is what it is.

677
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Steam doesn't always put the games I want on sale.

678
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Who's to say the humble bundle would have been something maybe I would have been interested in?

679
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Maybe it would have been another humble android bundle.

680
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Something I can't get any use out of.

681
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You know?

682
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It is what it is.

683
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You buy some and you leave some on the table.

684
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Like that speaks to me a little bit like every bundle should be catered to what I want.

685
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well that doesn't sound entitled at all.

686
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
By the way this is not the first time that Humble Bundle has done a bundle for one company.

687
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
There was the Humble Frozenbyte Bundle which I bought some time ago.

688
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Granted I know. Big difference.

689
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Frozenbyte is an indie company. Very different type of thing.

690
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But I just wanted to put that out there.

691
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's not unheard of for the Humble Bundle to do a pack dedicated to one company.

692
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I think it's a great deal and I would encourage our listeners to check it out and support it.

693
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Humblebundle.com. One thing we will not do on this show is give away keys that we bought for 5 cents to the pack of games minus Saints Row the Third.

694
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I find that shit to be incredibly tacky.

695
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And if you're one of these podcasts that buys keys for I guess really it's a dollar.

696
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I shouldn't say a quarter because you have to give a dollar minimum.

697
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But if you're one of these podcasts that buys the keys for a dollar just to get your show some cheap promotion and give them away on your show.

698
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm calling you out. That's fucked up. You're missing the point.

699
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You're denying what potentially could be sales for charity.

700
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Now it's another thing if you gave $20 or $10 or more and maybe you're including the Saints Row the Third thing.

701
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Because then okay you're fronting that kind of money for somebody who may not have the money.

702
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But think about it. If you buy it for a dollar and then give it away on your show to somebody who maybe hadn't heard of it yet.

703
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Who could have potentially spent $20 on the bundle but now won't because you gave them a key that you bought at bargain basement prices.

704
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You have robbed a charity of money for the sake of your own self-promotion. Don't do that.

705
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It is different if you buy the whole thing and go I'm not going to play this crap. No I'm kidding.

706
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Even then I mean I just I've seen. I'm giving them to Dan. There's a particular play.

707
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I saw a show doing it out there and I'm not going to say who that bought five out why not five codes.

708
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Well honestly I don't know the name of it because it was something I saw while I was Twitter bouncing.

709
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So I don't even remember the name of it but I just kind of I gave it so much stink eye. I'm like oh that's frustrating.

710
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Like stop it. All right. Let's see. Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

711
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Brad from Pod Culture says I always donate 100% to charity. I'm usually not a fan as of much as the gamers but they make a great perk for your donation.

712
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I think he means like kind of like the games. So let's see.

713
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Actdeft in chat says Darksiders is very well worth this bundle and you can give the Saints Row the third code to anyone you want.

714
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So you know you know and I see friends kind of code so that's different.

715
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Again friends now that's very very very different because friends aren't doing it for their own self-promotion.

716
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So all right. Let's move on. I don't want to focus on the negative but you know when something makes me irritated I'm going to say something about it.

717
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I am being a concerned parent right now as the show has been along for far too long. All right. Dark Sakura.

718
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Well how about something having to do with an old idea from Sony coming back to bite them in the ass.

719
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Well at least in theory. In 2008 they had patented a break apart PS3 controller and nothing happened with it.

720
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And it's also not you know the huge space boomerang that was there at E3.

721
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Well now they're revisiting the idea with a new patent that I mean it even has it down to the circuit boards and everything and two different versions of it with a regular PlayStation controller with little move bubbles on it which I don't get but OK.

722
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And then also it has regular PlayStation handles like controller handles and then really long ones like extra grips.

723
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I guess if you're doing move stuff with it so it almost seems to me like they're doing a two handed move controller.

724
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You know if I was going to design a controller I'd just make a new negcon.

725
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I do like the idea of there being a controller that kind of snaps apart and becomes the move. That's actually kind of rad.

726
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It looks completely dumb.

727
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
If they build it right.

728
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It was better designed.

729
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah I mean but Sony is not a stranger to going back and redesigning shit that gets received poorly. Remember the boomerang controller everybody.

730
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
At least that's what I said earlier it's not the space boomerang.

731
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah so at least it's not that what do you think Loki about a controller that can break apart and come together and all this looks dumb.

732
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It looks dumb only because you know a lot of people aren't interested in the move it's not like oh we need to sell more of these move controllers.

733
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I just I don't think the the thing that's keeping people out of the move is not the price point of their controllers.

734
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's that no one wants to play those games which is sad because it's a good controller.

735
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's a it's actually pretty good. To be honest it I think works better than the Kinect.

736
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And that's that that's the tragic thing is that in a way the move is really the best motion thing out of all of them.

737
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
But nobody seems to care.

738
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah and there's even some games out there I can't remember the one there's some download title that just came out.

739
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's where you splashing paint with the controllers and like unfinished one.

740
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That's it unfinished one. And I'm hearing raves about I haven't played it myself yet because I don't have a move although I hear I just found out like the other day you can do it with controllers.

741
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So I need to check it out but I'm hearing raves about that game.

742
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And in general the PlayStation Network in general like there's been a lot of great shit on that between Journey which you know is competing for Game of the Year for a reason in a lot of places.

743
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And you know the unfinished swan and some of these other games like there's so much great shit on PlayStation that like is not getting noticed like Sony has a marketing problem big time.

744
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And it's part of the reason why the move isn't really selling either. I think there is more to the move than the Kinect in many ways.

745
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I mean granted the move isn't moving the Kinect has Dance Central which is you know always going to be a fave of mine.

746
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But you know it doesn't it doesn't go much past the dancing games for me. But at least the move has some other interesting things.

747
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So let's see Tiger Claw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says here's the question what if you lose half of that break apart controller.

748
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You wouldn't be able to play with it because the half that's the analog stick and the D pad is missing.

749
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Well if you think about it what's the Wii U controller and the nunchuck. That was kind of a break away controller of sorts too.

750
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And a lot of times that kind of stood in for your typical controller was the nunchuck and the Wii pad.

751
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And if you lost the nunchuck then stupid you shouldn't have lost it. It was kind of that same thing.

752
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Cram in our chat room says a boomerang controller would be perfect for all those rage induced controller throws.

753
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
That is true. The PlayStation was the first console to get well Demon Souls was the first game.

754
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Let's see SSG100Matt says I like the boomerang. Some people some people liked it.

755
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Well I'll see how much you like it when it comes around to hit you in the head.

756
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't think it was an actual boomerang. I think the buttons cut out some of the arrow.

757
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I bet you anything that if they had marketed that way then someone would have found a way to make it work.

758
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Alright let's move on with some more news.

759
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about Timesplitters. One of my favorite first person shooter series.

760
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And really we need a new game. It's been like a long time. PlayStation 2 since Future Perfect.

761
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So now Timesplitters 4 that's been in talks for a while. Back when Free Radical was doing it.

762
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And then it was supposed to be being worked on by Crytek and stuff.

763
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Well unfortunately the reason it hasn't kind of come out yet is because they haven't been able to find a publisher to actually put it out.

764
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And it kind of sucks because Free Radical's last game Haze was kind of crap.

765
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And I think Timesplitters 4 would actually be a really great game.

766
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
They say that it was in very early stages of development when Free Radical went into administration.

767
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And they even had a small playable demo that was shown to several publishers.

768
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But it didn't attract enough of any publishing deals.

769
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And they're also saying that the marketing person. Or actually they're saying. Let's see here.

770
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Secondly the marketing person would say something along the lines of I don't know how to sell this.

771
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And then the unanimous opinion among all publishers were that they pitched Timesplitters 4.

772
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Or I guess it's a game you can't market because it's too diverse a set of characters.

773
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah it is kind of hard to explain a game that features exploding monkeys and cats with wheels on them that you race.

774
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But at the same time though look at Saints Row the Third. Perfect example.

775
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Granted that is a little bit more linear but you've got you know a thing from this crazy Japanese cat character to hitting people with giant purple cocks.

776
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So if they can market giant cocks all the time just saying I honestly think I think the game markets itself.

777
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You just show this crazy shit and people like cats with wheels. Fuck yes. Sign me up.

778
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Or I'm playing a game where I'm shooting people in duck costumes.

779
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It's part of part of the reason we got behind President Cat all those years ago is it was something different crazy and seriously just put the game out.

780
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It's going to be by understanding that everyone wants to play it really safe because you know new IPs kind of don't do well but take a risk.

781
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You have to take risks to succeed. We just talked about. Here's how you do it.

782
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You just you put out the HD version of you know the old PlayStation 2 games because you've got three of them.

783
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You can do an HD trilogy which people are trying to get a petition going and actually has a lot of signatures on to get that to happen.

784
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Then based on the response from that how well that sells then you go decide OK should we move forward with you know putting this out as you know times players for.

785
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I think it would do well. I think I mean if they put out an HD version of these games I would buy an RP.

786
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's easy. I mean times where it seriously was a great game. It was one of those games that I actually bought one of the.

787
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I forget what the hell they called it but like a multi tap but is basically you know maybe it was all these up you know the four player add on for the PS 2.

788
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I bought that for time splitters too. And it was fantastic fun. So I just hope they do it.

789
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Somebody put it out or hey you know what free radical I mean or X free radical because I think they're gone.

790
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:39,000
There's all I mean if they have the IP which I don't know who had owns IP right now but if they have the IP there's always Kickstarter and I guarantee that shit we get kick started no problem.

791
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
All right well speaking of bad management decisions Sega has been pulling some crazy shit on YouTube.

792
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:53,000
They are shutting down channels or I should say excuse me shutting down the videos which could lead to a channel shut down if it happens too many times.

793
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Of any type of uploaded video of the Sega Saturn RPG shining force 3.

794
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Now it's weird because you know it's not like shining force 3 is this brand it's not an episode of the walking dead that somebody's posting to YouTube.

795
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You know it's something that's years old so the question is why now. Well there is a new PSP installment called shining arc that is coming out in Japan in February.

796
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Okay so maybe they don't want people searching YouTube to get confused but doesn't that seem a little bit throwing the baby out with the bathwater to somebody.

797
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Here's the other crazy thing. Not only were let's play videos thrown out walkthroughs random gameplay clip clips fans talking about shining force were shut down.

798
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
How is that even possible.

799
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Well okay here's how it's possible because Sega is a YouTube partner. They get the little button that allows them to take down you know basically a content thing.

800
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
No questions asked the content provider has only 24 hours to appeal it that.

801
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:16,000
NBC has these buttons too and so forth and this is what led the internet to rage against Pippa and SOPA and all that stuff because it would have given the government one of these buttons.

802
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And you know it would have been open season on not just YouTube. Now granted YouTube has the right to do whatever they want on their turf.

803
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You can't claim this is a freedom of speech thing. There would be nothing stopping you from going to Vimeo or whatever unless Sega decides to crack down there too or whatever other site you want to do.

804
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But this just seems like a crappy decision on Sega's part especially if this is something to do with shining arc.

805
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
A game that's not even going to come out in the US or you know so we think so far.

806
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I mean so you're going to shut down all the fan channels of this niche game from many years ago to promote your new game. Why?

807
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You're just going to ruffle the feathers of the people that will most likely be buying your game.

808
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Why wouldn't you want some of the publicity out there and so forth?

809
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
AcidicVampire wants to know yeah OLR will this be bleeped on the downloaded podcast?

810
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,000
No because this podcast isn't a part of YouTube. It's part of VOG Network. We don't have an agreement with Sega.

811
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And that is where the government does allow me to say what I want for the purposes of critique.

812
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I wouldn't slander Shining Force or slander Sega or so what but I'm entitled to my opinion and my opinion is this is bullshit.

813
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And you can't sue me for that. I'm entitled to my opinion. I'm saying it on my own show that I pay for with my own money for the network and so forth and all that.

814
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That's freedom of speech.

815
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And freedom of the press.

816
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Exactly.

817
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So there you go. No I know AcidicVampire was teasing but I did want to make that point. He says I was teasing.

818
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Wise.

819
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So.

820
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah a cram in the chat says too. Now Sega is going to shut down OLR for mentioning Shining Force.

821
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force.

822
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Oh and how about this. Fantasy Star. How about some Fantasy Star Rob.

823
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I would play.

824
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Oppa Oppa.

825
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I would play some music from Shining Force but I can't because all the YouTubes have been shut down.

826
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Do I happen to have any in my collection?

827
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I've got soundtracks at home.

828
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I might. You never know.

829
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And there's also the soundcloud.

830
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Look what I have. Look what I have.

831
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Oh see.

832
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Look what I have.

833
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Look what I have.

834
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Let's play it.

835
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Alright everybody it's the totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

836
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Play that with mailbag.

837
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Play that with mailbag.

838
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
No because I think technically you're only allowed to use 30 seconds for the purposes of 15.

839
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
As I found out when doing the intro to another show, it's 10% of the song up to 30 seconds.

840
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Well we'll cut it off at 23 seconds. There you go.

841
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
So that song sucked.

842
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Just kidding. I don't really think that but I actually like Shining Force. That's the sad thing about it.

843
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

844
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I have like a bunch of the old Shining Force games.

845
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
AcidicVampire in chat says, I'm witnessing illegal behavior. Oh my.

846
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Frisbee in chat says, Orange Pirate Radio.

847
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
There you go. Alright.

848
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
SSG100Matt says, No no no it's only Shining Force 3 guys. Shining Force 1 and 2 don't count.

849
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Oh well.

850
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Alright anyhow. That was Shining Force Medley by the way.

851
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Let's move on to more news.

852
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
DarkSagra.

853
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Well, for anyone who is a fan of The Walking Dead, as we know who was, you know, not listening to Bobby's show and was watching The Walking Dead.

854
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Or reading books.

855
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Um, The Walking Dead Assault is going to be on iOS and it will be an isometric strategy game.

856
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Which, I mean, guarantees I won't be playing it because I hate those kinds of games.

857
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
However, it's a pretty neat looking game.

858
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It's, you know, mostly looks black and white with a few blue elements.

859
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And some blood splatter.

860
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Oh, there's some green in here.

861
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
So yeah, it looks like it's mostly black and white with some overlay of various bright colors as effects.

862
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
But it's, I don't know, it looks kind of neat.

863
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But it's supposed to be episodic like the Telltale series.

864
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And it's going to follow a new cast.

865
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And it's going to be based more on the comic.

866
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Quit promoting the competition. Geez.

867
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
No, I'm just kidding.

868
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Get it because the show is on?

869
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I hear the game is very, very good.

870
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That's on my list of things I need to finish this holiday season is The Walking Dead games.

871
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Even though I've never watched the show.

872
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
But it doesn't matter because the games are based on the books.

873
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It's the one common misconception people make.

874
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and look at some games that are coming out very, very soon.

875
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yes, this week we've got Far Cry 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PC.

876
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
A few games coming out on the Wii, Rise of the Guardians.

877
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Because it was a little bit delayed from the other launch.

878
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Family Party, 30 Great Games Obstacle Arcade on the Wii, only for 30 bucks.

879
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC, Rapalas Probe, Bass Fishing, 2012 on the Wii U.

880
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Cavella's Dangerous Hunts, 2013 on the Wii U.

881
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on the Wii U.

882
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Guardians of Middle Earth on PlayStation 3.

883
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Fun little voucher there.

884
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I like buying digital games in a package.

885
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Resistance Collection on the PS3.

886
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And what else here?

887
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, the Mass Effect trilogy on PS3 finally coming out.

888
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Already preordered.

889
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You are such a consumer whore.

890
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You would have done it too.

891
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You know what? No, I wouldn't have because I play on PC.

892
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Whatever.

893
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Also...

894
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I hope the PlayStation 3 version has an extra scene with Garrus.

895
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Just to make you mad.

896
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And yeah, that's actually it for this week.

897
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Almost to the end of games for this year because we only got a couple more weeks before.

898
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It's all kind of crap coming out next, but that's it.

899
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Alright, well let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.

900
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It's a little bit of a different story. It's a busy week in Japan.

901
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
On the Xbox 360, Saints Row the Third, the full package.

902
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'm assuming that is like the version that has all the DLC and whatever is out in Japan this week.

903
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
On the PlayStation 3, a couple price reductions for Biohazard Revival Selection.

904
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Resident Evil.

905
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Devil May Cry HD Collection, probably because of the new one.

906
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
A new slim console that's Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Emblem Edition.

907
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Because Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Yume Kanaishi Mono comes out this week from Sega.

908
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And that is on the PlayStation 3.

909
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And going to the Vita, nothing this week, but Spy Hunter coming out in Japan next week.

910
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I didn't even know that was still a thing that was going on.

911
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
On the 3DS this week in Japan, Paper Mario Super Seal.

912
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I'm hearing good things about that, by the way, here in the States.

913
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That's one I haven't looked at, but yeah.

914
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari 2.

915
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Like, what is that? That has nothing to do, like, it's not Pikachu.

916
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's just Pika Pika...

917
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I don't know what this is.

918
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It's cute!

919
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
What is she doing? She's like measuring crack on that little scale.

920
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Well, that seems like it's pretty self-explanatory.

921
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I think it's a vet hospital game, actually, judging from the pets on the calendars.

922
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I think it's like a pet hospital game.

923
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Maybe.

924
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
She's a pet pharmacist.

925
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3.

926
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Taikaizoku to Shippuden on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

927
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
But it doesn't end there.

928
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Know why?

929
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Because the Wii U launches on December 8th.

930
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
That is before our next show.

931
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Oh, stop it.

932
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The Wii U is great.

933
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And we'll be launching in Japan.

934
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Of course, just like they did here with the black version and the white version.

935
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
There's also a set they're going to be launching over there.

936
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
The Monster Hunter 3G HD Premium set.

937
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Because one of their huge launch games is Monster Hunter 3G HD version.

938
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That is a game that is launching with the console over there.

939
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Otherwise, other games launching in Japan this week for the Wii U.

940
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Assassin's Creed 3.

941
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Batman Arkham City Armored Edition.

942
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
FIFA 13 World Class Soccer.

943
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Mass Effect 3 Special Edition.

944
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Musou Orochi 2 Hyper.

945
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
New Super Mario Bros. U.

946
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Nintendo Land.

947
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge.

948
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

949
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And I think that's it.

950
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Zombie U.

951
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Rounding out the launch games over there in Japan.

952
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
That does it for Japanese release dates.

953
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

954
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
On the 4th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath.

955
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
On the 5th, Guardians of Middle Earth and The Critter Chronicles.

956
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
That's just a cute name.

957
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
On the 7th, we have Air Conflict Specific Carriers.

958
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Mass Effect Trilogy Edition for PS3.

959
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And Paper Mario Sticker Star.

960
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The end.

961
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
The end, Rob.

962
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Forever. No, I'm kidding.

963
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
No, we still have two more shows before that.

964
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Damn it. Okay.

965
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
By the way, speaking of all that,

966
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Hubbaloo and chat about the world ending on the 21st.

967
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Did you know NASA has an official section on their website

968
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
dedicated to why that whole thing is a farce?

969
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And like, the world is not even...

970
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
But I was reading this fascinating story on Google about how like,

971
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
like a lot of us kind of are treating it as a joke at this point.

972
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Like, yeah, okay, the world's ending again.

973
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Because we all went through this, what, just six months ago

974
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
when that wacko out of the East Bay was talking about, you know,

975
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
May whatever's Judgment Day, the rapture and all that.

976
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
But like, some people get seriously emotionally disturbed by this stuff.

977
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And I mean, it makes sense.

978
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Especially like, younger people really thinking like,

979
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the world is gonna end and they get really like, depressed over it.

980
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And like, you know, I don't mean to make light of it.

981
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Like, it's actually really sad.

982
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But it makes me just kind of think like, oh, we shouldn't,

983
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
shouldn't perpetuate that kind of crap.

984
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Because some people really take it like, too far.

985
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Like, they're just convinced.

986
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Even though NASA has come out and said,

987
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
look, there is no meteor headed towards Earth.

988
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
If there was, you could see it in the sky by now.

989
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It is not like, like, he's a black meteor.

990
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
You can't see black on black.

991
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Even in Majora's Mask, people, you could see the thing getting bigger

992
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
as it was coming towards Hyrule.

993
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,000
That would be ironic if it was the meteor with the face on it.

994
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Anyway, let's move on.

995
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
A couple more news stories for you guys.

996
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And then the classic game of the week.

997
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
But first, Loki.

998
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So this is kind of cool.

999
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You know, if you happen to invest in one of the Raspberry Pis,

1000
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
the little pocket sized computer that's like, 35 bucks.

1001
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You're gonna have a new game that you may be able to run on pretty soon.

1002
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
They're gonna be doing a Pi edition of Minecraft.

1003
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It's gonna be kind of similar to like, the Pocket edition.

1004
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Definitely scaled down to run on, you know, such a small computer.

1005
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
With limited processing power.

1006
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
But pretty awesome.

1007
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And it's gonna be free.

1008
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So, um, looking forward to that.

1009
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I actually kind of want to get one of these.

1010
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
They have a huge waiting list.

1011
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Or at least they did have a huge waiting list.

1012
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You know, to be able to buy one.

1013
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And I just, at the time I'm like, what the hell am I gonna do with this?

1014
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
But I still kind of want one.

1015
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Because it's kind of fun to, you know, mess with.

1016
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It's a $35 computer.

1017
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And now it plays Minecraft.

1018
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So that's even better.

1019
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Is Minecraft gonna be an Ouya thing?

1020
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Not to derail too much.

1021
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Speaking of cheap.

1022
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Well, here's the thing.

1023
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Minecraft is already on Android.

1024
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And granted, Ouya is gonna be supporting stuff through their marketplace.

1025
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But I would think that it would be able to run.

1026
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Depending on how they have the buttons mapped for the controllers.

1027
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
If it runs like any of those Bluetooth gamepads.

1028
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I mean, if you remember, there was a version that was on the Xperia Play.

1029
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Which is an Android device.

1030
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And, you know, that ran with controller support.

1031
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So technically maybe the Pocket Edition would be supported.

1032
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I would hope that they would have their own version for it.

1033
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But I don't think it's gonna be something you see at launch.

1034
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I mean, it's gonna be something that they'd have to, like, adapt to it.

1035
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Or get, you know, some sort of, you know, not just have to see how popular it is.

1036
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And then decide to port it over.

1037
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
But, you know, who's to say?

1038
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It might, you know, run other games that are not, you know, officially supported by Ouya.

1039
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And it just may run.

1040
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So, hopefully.

1041
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Alright, well, Dark Sakura, I don't think I've ever seen one of these in your vault.

1042
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
But, uh, a Vectrex. Do you have one of these in the vault?

1043
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The Vectrex?

1044
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
No.

1045
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
No? You should get one. They're pretty neat.

1046
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Even though they were kind of a very, very niche thing.

1047
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And if you don't know what this is, vector gaming was really big in the 80s.

1048
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
We almost had one.

1049
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah?

1050
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yeah.

1051
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
What stopped you?

1052
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And they were like, wait, it's a Vectrex.

1053
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Well, uh, vector gaming was kind of all the rage for a while there.

1054
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Probably the most well-known vector game would probably be what?

1055
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Tempest?

1056
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Actually, Star Wars.

1057
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yeah.

1058
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Remember, the original Star Wars was a vector game.

1059
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But vector games were also super big on the Atari systems, too.

1060
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
That's true. That's true.

1061
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Well, a whole system came out dedicated to vector-based games.

1062
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I had one for a while.

1063
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Did you really? I remember that. I do.

1064
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And they were like little tabletop units.

1065
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Yeah.

1066
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Right? And they had a game built in.

1067
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Mindstorm was the built-in game, which was basically Asteroids, but like, you know, that type of thing.

1068
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But they did release other games to the Vectrex.

1069
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Well, the Vectrex is coming back of sorts.

1070
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
It's a release called Vectrex Regeneration.

1071
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It is on the iOS platforms, meaning iPad and iPhone, of course.

1072
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It's free.

1073
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
So if you want to check it out, it does come with Mindstorm for free.

1074
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And you can check it out.

1075
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And I got to say, I was checking it out a little bit before the show.

1076
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And it's a pretty, you know, for these retro collections, they didn't do a shitty job of it.

1077
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You know, because sometimes you see these retro collections, they're kind of hack jobs, like they're not very good.

1078
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
But they actually, you know, put in little achievement systems.

1079
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
They have a little cork board in there that you can have your little achievements on.

1080
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And they have the box arts, the original one that you can fully rotate and, you know, look at.

1081
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
They did a pretty good job.

1082
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So, you know, hey, it's free. Why not check it out?

1083
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And you can play Mindstorm.

1084
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Now, of course, if you want more, 18 other titles from the Vectrex's collection are available for $6.99.

1085
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Not a bad deal.

1086
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That also comes with iCade support.

1087
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I find that interesting that they're paywalling that.

1088
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Almost got an iCade.

1089
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah?

1090
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
But still 100 bucks.

1091
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Like I said earlier, I still kind of want one.

1092
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I won't win two.

1093
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Even though it is 100 bucks, I do still kind of want one.

1094
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Because I just, can you imagine me just plopping it there on the table?

1095
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Do you know what we found, by the way?

1096
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
We found a little, I think it's like a NES controller thing that hooks onto Android phones.

1097
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Oh, that's cool.

1098
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Or like a special type of controller attachment.

1099
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
But it was kind of neat.

1100
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
But it was much cheaper.

1101
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
All 29 games ever released for the system will be added at some point as in-app purchases.

1102
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
What is missing from the app?

1103
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Actual plastic screen covers.

1104
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Like you had on the, do you remember you had to take these little screen covers?

1105
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
You know what was missing on my Vectrex?

1106
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Actual plastic screen covers.

1107
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Oh, yeah.

1108
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
You didn't have those?

1109
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
No.

1110
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I mean, you can play Mindstorm without one, but...

1111
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You can play all of them without them.

1112
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I mean, I'm sure that the games have like some sort of overlay.

1113
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah.

1114
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh, no, no.

1115
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Yeah.

1116
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Of course.

1117
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Yeah.

1118
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
In the app, obviously.

1119
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
How hard is it with modern technology?

1120
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Just draw the plastic on top of it.

1121
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But it still looked kind of neat.

1122
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I like that.

1123
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So check that out.

1124
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Just search for Vectrex in the app store.

1125
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
V-E-C-T-R-E-X.

1126
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
A little shout-out for those guys at Rant Media Games who've made that.

1127
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
All right.

1128
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Let's, hey, what a great lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.

1129
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the vault, so you know it won't be a Vectrex game.

1130
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But she's going to pick a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be playing this game.

1131
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You better recognize.

1132
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
How about you better recognize her?

1133
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Ooh, is it Tron?

1134
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Did you pick Tron as the Classic Game of the Week?

1135
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
No, I didn't.

1136
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Oh.

1137
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Dan picks the game again.

1138
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Again?

1139
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Yeah, but I have a reason for this one.

1140
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
All right.

1141
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
What is the Classic Game of the Week?

1142
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The Golden Axe.

1143
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I have not done Golden Axe.

1144
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Wow.

1145
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I should have done Shining Force.

1146
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You really should have, but that's okay.

1147
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah.

1148
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
All right.

1149
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So Golden Axe is the Classic Game of the Week.

1150
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Oh, man, Rob, your contrast is like way crazy on your computer.

1151
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

1152
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
We've all had those.

1153
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Stop the stupid ads.

1154
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I know.

1155
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
That's all right.

1156
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
But Golden Axe is a game that was primarily developed by Makoto Uchida.

1157
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And it's a side-scrolling hack and slash video game.

1158
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Pow!

1159
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Done in 1989 for the, um, actually System 16B arcade hardware.

1160
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And, of course, it came out on the Genesis and Master System much later.

1161
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's sort of a Conan the Barbarian type of game.

1162
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
The high fantasy medieval world.

1163
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And you play as one of three characters who are getting revenge on Death Adder.

1164
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
What a great name.

1165
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Of course, I always laugh at the later ones because we have Death Adder Jr.

1166
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That just makes me laugh.

1167
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Hi, I'm going to name you Death Adder Jr.

1168
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Um, so you...

1169
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Why not?

1170
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
If I have a kid, I think Rob Roberts Jr. would be a great name.

1171
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Don't you?

1172
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I thought you had a different one in mind.

1173
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yeah, but we can't get into it.

1174
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I know.

1175
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I'm not saying it.

1176
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Um, anyway, the first character you have is a dwarf that wields a battle axe called Gilius Thunderhead.

1177
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Which is just an awesome name.

1178
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And it's a golden axe.

1179
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Yes, but the actual golden axe is in the possession of Death Adder.

1180
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
What?

1181
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Who tries to use it to kill you to death.

1182
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Um, there's also a male barbarian.

1183
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And, Rob, this is an even better name.

1184
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Um, the guy's name is Axe Battler.

1185
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah, Axe Battler.

1186
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It just sounds to me like it would be, you know, um, something from like a re-dubbed anime.

1187
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
That was like, sort of like, you know, Voltron or something.

1188
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Um, and then you, uh, have, he uses a broadsword by the way.

1189
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And he's trying to avenge the murder of his mother.

1190
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And Gilius is trying to avenge the death of his brother.

1191
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And then you have the redhead lady, uh, Tyrus Flare.

1192
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Who is an Amazon.

1193
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And her parents were killed by Death Adder.

1194
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Death Adder is a bastard.

1195
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
He's just a dirty bitch.

1196
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Um, so anyway, they, uh, go to rescue everyone from Turtle Village.

1197
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Which actually turns out to be on a turtle.

1198
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And the turtle takes them across the sea.

1199
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And then they go to the castle in the back of a giant eagle.

1200
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And then they beat Death Adder to death.

1201
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
You know, how ironic.

1202
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And it turns out his daddy, Deathbringer, is the real final boss in the Genesis version.

1203
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And then they get the golden axe and they're immortal like forever.

1204
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So, um, it's, you've got like different, um, capabilities with them.

1205
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
For example, the dwarf is strongest on weapon but weakest on, um, spell power.

1206
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Where the, uh, Amazon is strongest on spell power but weakest on sword power.

1207
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And then the regular, you know, dude's like, look at my chest.

1208
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And he's all average.

1209
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Oh, I love the artwork for this because it looks like seriously something straight off of a D&D cover.

1210
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Um, but anyway, um, the, uh, the producer was super, you know, fond of the action movies.

1211
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Especially the Conan ones.

1212
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So that's why he, uh, you know, basically made the game in this theme.

1213
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And there's all kinds of other versions of it.

1214
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
There was the Mega Drive slash Genesis version that was very faithful to the arcade version.

1215
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
With an extra level of place you can kill Death Adder's daddy.

1216
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And we've got the, uh...

1217
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
This is my favorite part, kicking the shit out of those little gnomes that had the potions.

1218
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah.

1219
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Sorry.

1220
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And then, um...

1221
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,000
There was, uh, the, uh, Sega CD one that was a Sega Classics arcade that had Redbook audio music and voiceovers.

1222
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Um, there was a virtual console version.

1223
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
There was the Sega Smash Pack, the Genesis Collection, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.

1224
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Um, there's a version on PlayStation Plus for free.

1225
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Um, there were also PC versions that came out that had a 256 color palette in VGA mode.

1226
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And it could run it in EGA mode as well.

1227
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And a CGA and 2 color mode.

1228
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Which, why would you want to play it in 2 color?

1229
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
You haven't lived until you've played Golden Axe in CGA.

1230
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Anyway.

1231
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
But which color palette was it?

1232
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Was it the...

1233
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I'm pretty sure it was the CMYK.

1234
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Not the RGB, yeah.

1235
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Which is very funny since, um, monitors are built for RGB.

1236
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Actually, whoops, I'm sorry.

1237
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
No, the other palette wasn't RGB, it was RGY.

1238
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Blue was only in the CMYK palette.

1239
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
CMY.

1240
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
No, it wasn't even CMY.

1241
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
God, I can't get it right.

1242
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
CMYK is for print only.

1243
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
No, it was, it was, it was not, it was white.

1244
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Not black.

1245
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Yes.

1246
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Syma, Genta, uh, white and black.

1247
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And then the other one was...

1248
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
The CMWK?

1249
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Uh, red, green, yellow, and black.

1250
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah, that was it.

1251
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Okay.

1252
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Anyway.

1253
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Thank you for the history lesson.

1254
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Color theory.

1255
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Mr. Loki.

1256
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
The ZX Spectrum, um, and the Commodore 64 versions also were rather limited.

1257
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Um, there, like I said, there were different things added.

1258
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
The Master System version, um, retold the story from the perspective of the Axe Battler

1259
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
who was called Tarek in that game.

1260
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And it's only one player.

1261
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Um, Golden Axe was also released by, um, Telnet for the PC Engine.

1262
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And it was, like, super resampled music, cut scenes, you name it.

1263
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
It's a very, very freaking good version of that game.

1264
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Um.

1265
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Sorry for the, uh, cut fact that the music cut out, but I, I'm trying to find a YouTube

1266
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:44,000
clip of Golden Axe CGA, because I found a YouTube clip of 39 DOS retro games in CGA.

1267
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Dude.

1268
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I saw the Deanna Jones.

1269
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I didn't even know they had DuckTales in CGA.

1270
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Dude, dude.

1271
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Oh, God, it was purple.

1272
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Well, I will continue while Rob's looking for that.

1273
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Um, there was also a handheld TV game of the arcade legend Sega Genesis Volume 1, and an

1274
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
enhanced remake that came out on PS2 as part of the Sega Ages line, which we came close

1275
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
to getting.

1276
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Was the skater die guy supposed to be Rodney Dangerfield?

1277
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Because I swear to God.

1278
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I swear to God it's Rodney Dangerfield.

1279
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
No respect.

1280
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Alright, never mind.

1281
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Okay.

1282
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to derail with another game, but it was an important question that

1283
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
had to be asked.

1284
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I will give you, um.

1285
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1286
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
You found it?

1287
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Here's the answer.

1288
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
It is the, it is the red, green, yellow, black palette.

1289
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
There is Golden Axe.

1290
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It doesn't look too terrible for what it is.

1291
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
In all your studying.

1292
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Oh, that's not the actual audio.

1293
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That's just from the video.

1294
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But there is Golden Axe.

1295
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I was gonna say, that actually looks, that doesn't look that bad.

1296
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah.

1297
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
They did some pretty crazy shit with four colors back in the day.

1298
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Damn.

1299
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You should see strip poker CGA.

1300
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I have.

1301
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Oh, Lord.

1302
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Of course you have.

1303
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Well, here's a little factoid with my history with this game.

1304
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,000
The second game I ever played on the Sega Saturn, Rob, was Golden Axe, the duel.

1305
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Wow.

1306
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You know, the first game I played was?

1307
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It's a crappy Gundam game that came out, my friend imported.

1308
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So, anyway.

1309
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
There you go.

1310
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Best classic game.

1311
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Golden Axe.

1312
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Awesome.

1313
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Pow.

1314
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Sorry, now I'm looking up.

1315
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Oh my God.

1316
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Rob.

1317
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
It's strip poker on the Commodore 64.

1318
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh my God, Rob.

1319
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
You need to put that porn away.

1320
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Some of those strip poker games may have for shareware.

1321
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Oh my God.

1322
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Somebody should flag this video for being disgusting.

1323
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Hey, I see some bush.

1324
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Exactly.

1325
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Four colors.

1326
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I mean, serious.

1327
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Oh, the 80s.

1328
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I don't know why it's so funny.

1329
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Oh, I know exactly why it's so funny.

1330
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Rob, do you find pubes really funny?

1331
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Well, no, I'm laughing because it just happened to be at the moment I was looking at the video,

1332
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
it said, my hand, because, you know, as in a poker reference, but then I'm like, her

1333
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
hand looks like it's in her butt.

1334
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
She's getting herself ready.

1335
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You shouldn't be calling it.

1336
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
In fact, I will actually post that and see.

1337
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Alpha Kinanogram is demanding links.

1338
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
There you go in the chat room.

1339
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
There you go.

1340
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Strip poker.

1341
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Since we're on the illegal episode of Orange on the Radio.

1342
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Strip poker in all its Commodore 64 glory.

1343
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
We'll share porn with the kids too.

1344
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Sorry, I'm also asking Rama to tumble this with a parental advisory.

1345
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Good Lord.

1346
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
All right.

1347
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Here we go.

1348
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Moving on.

1349
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
That's it for part A.

1350
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
We need to take a break and clean up our act.

1351
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It's a very dirty illegal show tonight, but there's plenty more to come in part B.

1352
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We've got more Wii U to talk about.

1353
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
We're going to talk about sales figures over Black Light Friday, Black Friday, and more

1354
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
news on Ouya and some Nintendo rumors when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1355
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:57,000
right after this.

1356
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1357
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Live on this December the 2nd of 2012 with the 484th episode of our podcast.

1358
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
We're going to hit 500 early next year.

1359
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Can you believe it?

1360
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
We need to plan something special, like for real this time.

1361
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Like even bigger than our 10th anniversary show, which was just like people visiting

1362
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
from far away coming to see the show.

1363
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
We need to plan something huge for our 500th episode.

1364
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I don't know what, but something that can be done on a very low budget.

1365
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
We'll have to throw ourselves a party at Chuck E. Cheese.

1366
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
That's about what can fit in the budget.

1367
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
How will THQ bundle scene codes for everyone?

1368
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Resell keys to the bundle.

1369
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
No, that's terrible.

1370
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
That's awful.

1371
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
How dare you even suggest that?

1372
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
We'll figure something out.

1373
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
OLR Kickstarter for OLR Con.

1374
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
No, I don't know.

1375
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I guess it would be more appropriate to have the party at Roseville Golf Land.

1376
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Did you know that the other night, um, you know, Saturday night was kind of a blood day,

1377
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
but there was a break in the storms and Alan and I were kind of going,

1378
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
what should we do?

1379
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Should we even go do something?

1380
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
What do you want to do?

1381
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And it was actually suggested, should we go to Roseville Golf Land?

1382
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And we were like, what would we do?

1383
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
We're going to drive all the way out there and play what?

1384
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Like there's not that many great arcade games anymore.

1385
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I guess we could have driven to that bowling alley in Rockland.

1386
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
That's got some stuff.

1387
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I like them, but

1388
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Blood strikes or whatever it's called.

1389
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
At least the last time I was there, they had some interesting things, but whatever.

1390
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Uh, all right.

1391
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
We'll figure something out.

1392
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Uh, yep.

1393
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But no breaks in the near future coming.

1394
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
As far as we know, we're going to keep doing an episode every week on into 2013.

1395
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Assuming, of course, the world does not end in a couple of weeks,

1396
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
although we all know it won't.

1397
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Come on.

1398
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
The media needs something to report on.

1399
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1400
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Loki.

1401
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
All right.

1402
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So let's talk about something I mentioned during my gaming week,

1403
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
which is Skrillex.

1404
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Skrillex?

1405
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Crest.

1406
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I swear, that's like a tongue twister for me.

1407
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It's basically kind of a combination of a bunch of different things.

1408
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Retro, like NES games.

1409
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Because the whole thing, the premise of it is that there's this piece of dust

1410
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
that falls onto an NES cartridge,

1411
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
and it's what happens when that dust corrupts everything in the game.

1412
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And so you're completing this, uh, link type character

1413
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
that's kind of done in this, you know, sword and sorcery type art.

1414
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And you're fighting glitches that are in the game

1415
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and trying to save this sort of princess thing.

1416
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And it's pretty cool.

1417
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It's a free game.

1418
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
You can check it out on their website.

1419
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Which, let's see here.

1420
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I don't remember the hell it is.

1421
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
But, um, it's pretty cool.

1422
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
It's done by, like I said, the guy that did the Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now game,

1423
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
the Perfect Strangers one, Jason Oda.

1424
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
He kind of specializes in Adver games.

1425
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
And, yes, so check this out.

1426
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It's SkrillexQuest.com.

1427
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
It's pretty easy to find that.

1428
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Another kind of indie game that's getting a really unasked for sequel,

1429
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
uh, Barclay's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden

1430
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:29,000
is getting the sequel entitled The Magical Realms of Tirnaa Nog,

1431
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of C'thulun,

1432
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
and the official game of the movie,

1433
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
chapter two of the Hoops Barclay saga,

1434
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
or Barclay 2 for short.

1435
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
It's being Kickstarted right now.

1436
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And to be honest, I mean, I remember seeing some of the stuff

1437
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
for Barclay's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden,

1438
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
and this looks nothing like it.

1439
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It just looks like kind of this weird cyberpunk game.

1440
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Um, and they're looking for $35,000 on Kickstarter,

1441
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
and some of the bonuses include all sorts of weird things,

1442
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
including a cyberdwarf body pillow,

1443
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and of course, you know, game downloads, soundtrack, and that kind of stuff.

1444
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So that's interesting.

1445
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
And then last but not least, Dishonored doing pretty well in retail market.

1446
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Their sales have exceeded the expectations of Bethesda,

1447
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
so I guess that means we're going to see another series of games,

1448
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
or another franchise from Bethesda, which is fine.

1449
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I think it was a pretty awesome game.

1450
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Apparently, it sold 460,000 copies in North America during October.

1451
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And of course, the sales figures, I think, for November,

1452
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
obviously haven't been released yet, because we just got into December.

1453
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
So we'll have to see what it did, you know,

1454
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
competing up against Assassin's Creed and...

1455
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Well, actually, I guess we saw a little bit of Assassin's Creed sales in there,

1456
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,000
but, you know, more Assassin's Creed 3 sales in Halo 4 and Black Ops 2.

1457
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Yeah.

1458
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
All right, well, moving on to a game I talked about last week,

1459
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed.

1460
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
It's going to be a game that's going to get a patch on the Wii U.

1461
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
The Wii U version of the game is borked right now.

1462
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You'll know that if you've tried to beat the boost challenge.

1463
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
It is pretty much impossible to beat.

1464
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I guess if you're, like, superhuman, you can beat it.

1465
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
But, yeah, some boost pads that are supposed to be there,

1466
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
that are there in the other versions of the game, not there.

1467
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
No wonder I couldn't beat it when I played it.

1468
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I was like, this is too hard.

1469
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And I thought maybe I needed to do more drifting to get those boosts,

1470
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
but I guess there really was a bug.

1471
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
So the patch has already been sent to Nintendo for review.

1472
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
So I'm assuming that means it will be out very soon.

1473
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You just weren't snaking enough.

1474
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I guess not, which, technically, I don't know if that's something you can do.

1475
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I mean, you can't do it to the level.

1476
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You can do it in Mario Kart, but it's possible.

1477
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Also, speaking of Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed,

1478
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
there is going to be DLC for the game at some point,

1479
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
especially, we know, on 360 and PlayStation 3 versus the game.

1480
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
But folks in the community were throwing out ideas for DLC,

1481
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
and executive producer Steve Lysett with Sumo Digital,

1482
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
who made the game, put out a challenge.

1483
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Quote, without any policing from the Sumo or Sega crew,

1484
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
if you can all agree on three characters by the first of December

1485
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
and prove there is sufficient interest of at least 1,000 unique people per character,

1486
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I will present the result to Sega, the fans delivered,

1487
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
separate change.org petitions for the following characters

1488
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
for these three current leaders.

1489
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Hatsune Miku, Project D.Va, that's a great choice.

1490
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Ryo Hazuki, from Shenmue, no surprise there.

1491
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Segata Sanshiro, the Sega Saturn mascot, if you weren't already aware.

1492
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
No guarantees that those three characters will be included,

1493
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
but those are some pretty bitchin' choices.

1494
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I hope that they do include Ryo, that they include him driving a forklift.

1495
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I hope when he takes somebody out, he'll be,

1496
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
there's your game of Lucky Hit, asshole.

1497
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Moving on to some other...

1498
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I want to see, like, Echo the Dolphin or something like that.

1499
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Some ridiculous that just won't work, you know, or, I don't know.

1500
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Do they have ToeJam and Earl in there?

1501
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I don't think so.

1502
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
There's still a lot of great Sega characters they could use.

1503
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
But anyway, moving on to other Nintendo news about the Wii U.

1504
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
In an interview with IGN, Satoru Iwata said,

1505
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
you know what, we're not interested in emulating online services

1506
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
like Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.

1507
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Here we go again with that whole, we gotta be different.

1508
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
The jokes write themselves.

1509
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Let me read the quote, then you make the joke.

1510
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
We have not thought that offering the same features that already exist

1511
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
within other online communities would be the best proposal

1512
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
for very experienced game players.

1513
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Nintendo has paid a great deal of attention to the dynamic

1514
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
of people playing video games together in the same room.

1515
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
With Wii U, we thought about expanding this concept into separate rooms,

1516
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
which are connected online.

1517
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Miiverse is a network community dedicated to video games

1518
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
that represents a very unique game-dedicated social graph

1519
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
that has never existed before.

1520
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
All right, although I think about half that statement

1521
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
as the typical blowing-smoke-up-my-ass stuff

1522
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
that you get in the PR speak world,

1523
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
you do have to admit Miiverse is something different.

1524
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
It is not done on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.

1525
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
It is different.

1526
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I think you totally missed the whole underlying statement here

1527
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
that they've totally put forth.

1528
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
They want you to buy one for each member of your family.

1529
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
That's why there's only one game pad for that console.

1530
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It's because each member of your family should own one

1531
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
in their own separate rooms.

1532
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
That's right, and they'll connect via the internet.

1533
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Don't you know that's why the Wii Mini exists?

1534
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
The Canadian Wii Mini so that every kid's bedroom can have one.

1535
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
But it can't be connected to each other because...

1536
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
It doesn't matter. Shut up and go play Wii Sports.

1537
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Go to your room. Okay.

1538
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Why would I play a game that came out with the Wii?

1539
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It's not like it's Super Mario Brothers or something like that.

1540
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
You know, a game that actually is awesome.

1541
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Shut up and go play Wii Fit.

1542
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I'm sorry. That game's terrible.

1543
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Wasn't there supposed to be a Wii Fit U?

1544
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Yeah, there is.

1545
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Where is it?

1546
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Launch Window. Remember, they still have six more years.

1547
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Excuse me.

1548
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Launch Window is such bullshit.

1549
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Launch Window should be that week that's coming out.

1550
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
You know, if it launches on Sunday...

1551
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Hey, I understand that all games are not going to be free on Sunday.

1552
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Like a month. From launch to Christmas would have been Launch Window to me.

1553
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Launch Window is not fucking your fiscal year that the launch happens to take place in.

1554
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:37,000
That's like calling a hole blown into your wall that's the entire site of your house.

1555
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
That's the Launch Window for investors only.

1556
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The people that Nintendo's really trying to speak to.

1557
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
That's like calling the wall missing in a dollhouse a window.

1558
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

1559
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Miiverse is very unique. I think it's cool.

1560
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
People can write and stuff directly from the gamepad.

1561
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
However, if I had it, I wouldn't be able to draw on it.

1562
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I can't draw Jack's shit, only stick figures.

1563
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yeah, I gotta admit, the whole Miiverse thing, as much as I do love it,

1564
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I think it's great and the community element and so forth,

1565
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
it really reminds me how bad of a drawer I am.

1566
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I tried to draw one for one of the levels I beat in Mario and it's just, it's not, it's not good.

1567
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I'm not a good artist at all.

1568
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
And the Wii U makes me feel insignificant.

1569
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
You know, I think this is going to be very popular until it goes away,

1570
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
a Pictochat where everyone just kind of like, I'm over it.

1571
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I can't believe internet Pictochat's not a thing, but I guess Nintendo can't please that.

1572
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
That would be awesome.

1573
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Penises everywhere.

1574
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Think about the children.

1575
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
One of the places Nintendo was getting slammed with the launch of the Wii U console

1576
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
was that you can't really move your Nintendo network account.

1577
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Well, some clarity's come forth this week.

1578
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Through somebody who sent their bricked Wii U system into Nintendo,

1579
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Nintendo in turn sent them back a brand new console that was allowing them to sign in

1580
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
to their previously made Nintendo network account.

1581
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
So there's the answer.

1582
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
If you want to move your Nintendo ID from one console to another,

1583
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
just send it in to Nintendo. They'll do it for you.

1584
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
That's cost effective.

1585
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I'm assuming, especially if they launch Wii U.

1586
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
That's the way they do it with the Wii.

1587
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
If they, when they launch Wii U's in other colors and other shapes and all this other stuff,

1588
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
there'll be a way to do it in the future.

1589
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
There'll be a, a move me channel or something.

1590
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's just stupid.

1591
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
It is a little ridiculous.

1592
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
It's just like, hey, features that are helpful.

1593
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Ah, fuck that. We're different.

1594
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
We, we don't want to emulate the guys that actually have functioning online services.

1595
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
We're just gonna, we're gonna wing it.

1596
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It's our, we're gonna wing it.

1597
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
We're gonna try to create something that's more like, you know, social and stuff.

1598
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Oh, patches?

1599
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Well, uh, uh, online connectivity?

1600
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Uh, well, um, yeah.

1601
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I don't know.

1602
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Alright, Bobby in our chat room by Black Wolf says,

1603
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I drew something that said I couldn't draw.

1604
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I got Yaz for it.

1605
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
My stick figure flipped a table and a stick kitty told me to please be reasonable with the table.

1606
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I haven't seen that drawing yet.

1607
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I need to log on to Miiverse.

1608
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Alright, uh, let's move on.

1609
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Dark Sakura.

1610
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Uh, hold on.

1611
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Okay, there we go.

1612
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Well, uh-

1613
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Hold on to what?

1614
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Shush.

1615
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
The new Super Mario Bros. 2 is getting Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 levels

1616
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
and they are available now.

1617
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
They are through, uh, it looks like free Coin Rush content and is now available to download.

1618
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
So, that's good for people who have that.

1619
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Yay for DLC, right?

1620
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
After that, it's gonna be $250.

1621
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Then, um, for the Vita, there is going to be, um, a PlayStation Plus, uh, bundle.

1622
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:48,000
So, it's gonna be $300 and, um, it will have the PlayStation Plus Instant Game collection

1623
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:55,000
and it will be a black 3G Wi-Fi Vita, a year of Plus, and a voucher for download of Unit 13

1624
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
and a 4GB memory card.

1625
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And last, uh, but not least, um, Stern is bringing out Avengers Pinball.

1626
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Yay.

1627
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Which, I mean, we all saw that coming anyway because Stern is basically the only releaser of pinball games now.

1628
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
But, hey, it will, uh, hopefully be a good table.

1629
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

1630
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL Question of the Week.

1631
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
It's my vehicle.

1632
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Facebook plus Google. Slam them together and you get FUGL.

1633
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And, uh, we ask a question on our social network communities every week.

1634
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
This week is the following.

1635
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
What is on your gamer's Christmas list?

1636
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Or Hanukkah, Festivus, whatever it is you observe.

1637
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
So, that's it. Pretty simple question with the holidays coming up.

1638
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
We want to know what people are asking for from Santa Claus and Hanukkah Harry

1639
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
and their Festivus poll and the moon or whatever it is.

1640
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
So, starting off with some of the answers from Facebook.

1641
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
We have a lot of answers tonight. I can't read them all.

1642
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I'm going to read some of the names I don't usually see in chat.

1643
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Uh, Dart Charger says,

1644
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,000
While I wasn't quite willing to pull the trigger myself, I wouldn't mind if Santa put a Wii U under the tree.

1645
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm not going to buy a Wii U.

1646
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
James S. replied and said,

1647
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I have my eye on PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,

1648
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
but other than that, I believe next year will be exponentially better.

1649
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Possibly even new consoles from Sony and Microsoft.

1650
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
You know, we didn't get into it in tonight's news. We're not going to.

1651
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But, uh, the Microsoft rumors were taken off again about the new console.

1652
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Like, it even showed up on my Google News feed.

1653
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Uh, just more rumors about Microsoft launching in Holiday 2013.

1654
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
And I almost kind of thought that was a given.

1655
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I don't know why it suddenly got a little...

1656
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It's just someone else saying the same thing again.

1657
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Investors picking up on it.

1658
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Oh, we think they're going to...

1659
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
We're an analyst and we think that they're going to launch a new console, you know, next year.

1660
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Cool. You know, if I say that, no one fucking cares.

1661
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Here's the part that surprised me about that story.

1662
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
The part that was news and interesting is that they may not unveil it at E3.

1663
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
They may do their own event.

1664
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Which, it makes sense. Why not?

1665
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
They can get away with it. Nintendo does it.

1666
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I mean, they do E3, but instead of Tokyo Game Show, they do their own thing.

1667
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Why shouldn't Microsoft do their own thing?

1668
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I actually think that's a great idea, actually, as long as it's before E3.

1669
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Because unveil the console before E3 and then make E3 about...

1670
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
What, everybody? What? What?

1671
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
The games.

1672
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Xbox Live. No.

1673
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Halo 5?

1674
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I would love that. I would love it if E3 could actually be about the game.

1675
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
So, alright.

1676
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Oop, I guess the music was too loud in that previous segment.

1677
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Sorry, I thought it was at its usual volume. My bad.

1678
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Live radio, it's fun.

1679
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I heard myself. Alright.

1680
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Let's see.

1681
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Burr replied and said,

1682
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I'm terrible in that I've already bought everything I wanted for myself, like a Wii U and whatnot.

1683
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I would love a Steam sale on Borderlands 2 DLC or Mass Effect 3 DLC, however.

1684
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Yeah, I mean, that's the thing about growing up, is that you kind of end up buying yourself all the stuff you want.

1685
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Like, I bought myself a Wii U. That was kind of my early Christmas present to myself.

1686
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I'm not really expecting anything else from anyone.

1687
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
You know, I wanted it. I bought it. Happy holidays.

1688
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Degenerate Johnny said,

1689
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
To be honest, I've been pretty disappointed with this fall's lineup of games.

1690
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Therefore, my holiday list will consist of paid-off pre-orders of next year's games,

1691
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
such as Dead Space 3, as well as BioShock Infinite.

1692
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Tiara from Geek-Life.com said,

1693
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I need the new Skyrim DLC, Dragonborn.

1694
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
No, really. I need it. For reasons.

1695
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Let's see.

1696
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Critical Myth replied and said,

1697
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Assassin's Creed 3, PlayStation Vita with Assassin's Creed Liberation,

1698
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
and a couple of memory cards. Mass Effect Trilogy. Those are the big ticket items.

1699
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
And Dave Falcon said,

1700
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Assassin's Creed 3 for my fiancée for Hanukkah.

1701
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Well, that's what you bought somebody else. We want to know what you wanted under your tree.

1702
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But I guess that works.

1703
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Let's see. Moving on to our Google Plus community.

1704
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Just a few comments here, so I'll read these.

1705
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
ActDeft says, I want an HDTV to play games in HD.

1706
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'm still rocking a 15-inch SDTV.

1707
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
A 3DS, since it's turning out to be a solid console now.

1708
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Forza Horizon Season Pass.

1709
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
King of Fighters XIII for 360.

1710
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It's free on PlayStation Plus, just saying.

1711
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Although I guess PlayStation Plus isn't free, but whatever.

1712
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Zone of the Enders HD.

1713
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Everything on my Steam wish list.

1714
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
RAM for my PC.

1715
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
You have a big list, ActDeft.

1716
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Oh well, lots of options, right?

1717
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Monster Bee wants the following for Christmas.

1718
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
A PlayStation 3 controller charging station,

1719
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
and a Steam gift card to help support my addiction in 2013.

1720
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
What are you talking about 2013? That winter sale will still be going on in 2012.

1721
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
And lastly, AJ Twist replied and said,

1722
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
King of Fighters XIII on PlayStation 3,

1723
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
a PlayStation 3 arcade stick,

1724
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV Turtles in Time on the Super Nintendo.

1725
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Good pick. Good pick.

1726
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
All right, that does it for the FUGL Question of the Week.

1727
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
DarkSakura, do you have any holiday gaming wishes?

1728
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Garris.

1729
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Oh yes, you even replied on Facebook. You want your Garris figure, right?

1730
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Yep.

1731
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Where's that from?

1732
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Play Arts.

1733
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Did you see the Mass Effect museum-style artwork that they were selling?

1734
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I didn't see very big pictures of it, but it's okay.

1735
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
It looked nice. Me wanty.

1736
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Loki, anything on your holiday list?

1737
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I have really pretty much, you know, I bought the last console game I'm going to get,

1738
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:59,000
so, uh, real thing, you know, if I'm going to get gifted something,

1739
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
like a year to PlayStation Plus would be kind of cool,

1740
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
because I don't really want to pay for that.

1741
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I don't even know if I would really use that.

1742
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Maybe a Raspberry Pi, but trying to explain that to anybody.

1743
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
You know, it would be difficult for them to understand what the hell I was talking about.

1744
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
You want pie? I thought you didn't like pie.

1745
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Yeah, that'd pretty much be it.

1746
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I was going to say, it's funny, our family, we kind of draw names, you know,

1747
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
and just get one person, except for, you know, Josh gets gifts from everybody.

1748
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
My wife, she's like, oh, I hope I get your name.

1749
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
She's all, you know, instead of, you know, your mom or something like that,

1750
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
because I don't know what to get them.

1751
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
So, she got my name, and she's like, I'm not getting you anything.

1752
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Like, thanks.

1753
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Nice, nice, happy holidays.

1754
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Well, maybe it'll be a surprise if she does get you something.

1755
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Don't hold your breath.

1756
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
No, I'm not holding my breath.

1757
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Um, on my, again, I pretty much bought everything I wanted,

1758
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
but I wouldn't mind if I got, like, an iCade, or even, like,

1759
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
like, one of these things I don't think I would ever buy myself,

1760
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
but if it showed up, I'd be kind of happy, would be one of those Atari Flashback consoles.

1761
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I like retro shit.

1762
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I don't even think they sell those anymore.

1763
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
They do at Toys R Us. I saw one the other day.

1764
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I figured they'd have old ass inventory.

1765
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
They're not the old, they're like the 3, the Flashback 3s,

1766
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
or whatever the newest ones are.

1767
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
So, I like retro shit.

1768
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It amuses me.

1769
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Or a Ben Heck Xbox 360 laptop would be fucking awesome.

1770
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I want a working Commodore 64 to hook up to my TV,

1771
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
which I don't even think you could do without some major converters,

1772
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
but damn it, I would try it.

1773
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Oh, man.

1774
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Well, don't they have, like, an RF adapter?

1775
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah, well, um...

1776
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
They have the, well, it's UHF, right?

1777
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Yeah, there was, you could hook up...

1778
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Well, they have the UHF to RF. They used to have this.

1779
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
You could hook up a Commodore 64 through RF adapter,

1780
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
or something that was very similar to RCA plugs,

1781
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
except for one video and two audio, there was two video and one audio.

1782
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
So, like, you could, like, they didn't cross work,

1783
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
but you could probably get a converter for those, too, somewhere.

1784
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Well, I think the Commodore 64 monitors were RGB, like, arcade monitors.

1785
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
So, I have a converter board for that, you know, to play arcade games on your TV.

1786
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
AlphaCananagram in our chat room says,

1787
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Rob, it's an Atari Flashback 4 with wireless controls now.

1788
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Oh, I had no idea. There you go. I want one.

1789
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Gimme, gimme, I want it all.

1790
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
All right, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

1791
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
So, you know, Zynga and Facebook have been pretty chummy for a while now,

1792
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
but now they're just trying to read, you know,

1793
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
set out new terms as far as their partnership goes.

1794
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Basically, what's gonna happen is they're gonna have some opportunities

1795
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
to have Facebook, to have kind of official Facebook games,

1796
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:46,000
and also, it'll also kind of tie in with Zynga will still, I guess,

1797
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:51,000
use Facebook's payment system, but they're gonna kind of try to,

1798
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I guess, find a way to separate a little bit.

1799
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
They're gonna allow, it's gonna allow each of the parties like Zynga

1800
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,000
to promote game, their own games that they create,

1801
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
and also, I guess, before they were required to use,

1802
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I guess, Facebook's monetization platform,

1803
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
and now Facebook could, you know, make their own games

1804
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
to compete with Farmville and stuff.

1805
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
So, unfortunately, you know, the way I see this as,

1806
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
you know, there's so many Farmville and those types of game clones,

1807
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,000
it's just, I think Facebook came out with the official Facebook farming game.

1808
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I don't think anyone would give a shit.

1809
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I think it would be just like, you know, if EA came out with a farming game,

1810
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
no one would care.

1811
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Insert my typical Facebook rant here.

1812
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I'm just, I'm so over Facebook.

1813
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
You know, I was talking to somebody on my Facebook tonight

1814
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
about why I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook,

1815
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and there was even a post I saw on Twitter that kind of talked about this,

1816
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
and I really do like, I just, I, right now, as of late,

1817
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook,

1818
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
because even though there are offensive things on Twitter,

1819
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
don't get me wrong, like, people tend to offend a lot less on Twitter,

1820
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:11,000
and I think it's, like, the character restriction kind of is, you know,

1821
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
tighter there, so you have to really think before you post,

1822
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
and, like, people aren't as forthright to just spew stuff all over,

1823
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
and, I don't know, it's great.

1824
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I loves Twitter.

1825
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It's not perfect, but I, and there's no games, no games.

1826
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
The only thing that shows up in my feed, promoted posts,

1827
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
and luckily, they're pretty easy to scroll past.

1828
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Those are also on Facebook.

1829
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Oh, yeah. In fact, the Frugal Question of the Week,

1830
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I posted it tonight, and Facebook brings up this little pop-up,

1831
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
would you like to promote this post for only $5,

1832
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
which made me think, oh, nobody's going to see the Frugal Question of the Week this week,

1833
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
which reminds me, listeners,

1834
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
although I'm not always the best at getting the Frugal Question up,

1835
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
like, with a lot of time before the show,

1836
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I usually have it up a good four or five hours before the show,

1837
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
so, like, you know, about an hour before the show starts,

1838
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
load Facebook, go directly to our page,

1839
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
and you'll find the question. It's there.

1840
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Because I'm worried that Facebook probably isn't showing it to you

1841
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
because of their algorithm.

1842
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I would love to see a social network that's, like,

1843
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
the good parts of Facebook,

1844
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
combined with the way Twitter works,

1845
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
combined with, like, Tumblr.

1846
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Like, the thing I can't stand about Tumblr is that it's all, like,

1847
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
you can't, like, comment on anything,

1848
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
and you can't have a conversation on Tumblr.

1849
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I hate the way you have conversations on Tumblr.

1850
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
There's a lot of good content out there. It's good for fandoms and all that,

1851
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
but I just, I can't figure Tumblr out.

1852
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I know Dark Sakura has.

1853
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Tumblr's awesome.

1854
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Yeah.

1855
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Black Wolf says, really? There's Twitter drama every week.

1856
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Yeah, but in a Michael Jackson eating popcorn gif kind of way.

1857
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
The good news is it usually doesn't involve me or my friends,

1858
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
so I'm okay with it.

1859
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Twitter drama is when celebrities say shit, you know.

1860
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Anyway.

1861
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Moving on.

1862
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I don't want to talk all about social networking.

1863
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Everybody knows where they stand.

1864
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Sales figures coming in from the launch weekend of the Wii U for,

1865
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
excuse me, launch week.

1866
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
400,000 Wii U's sold in the first week.

1867
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Over that same period,

1868
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Nintendo sold 300,000 Wii consoles and 500,000 portable devices.

1869
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That's 1.2 million units sold in the US.

1870
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Also, it should be noted that the Xbox and Playstation sales figures came in,

1871
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
and I apologize, I don't have it in front of me,

1872
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
but it was around 700,000, 750,000 for the Xboxes,

1873
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,000
and I want to say Sony was 700,000 when you combined both the Playstation 3 and the Vita,

1874
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
which led a lot of people to say,

1875
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
OMG, we use dead already.

1876
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
We use dead already.

1877
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Xbox 360 is six-year-old consoles out selling the Wii U.

1878
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Wait a minute.

1879
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
What is the internet forgetting, Loki?

1880
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
They're forgetting that that's all that was available.

1881
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
It sold out.

1882
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,000
It's just they only made that many consoles available at the time.

1883
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
You also have to figure if they sold any more of that,

1884
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
well, actually the first week would have included Black Friday, I would assume.

1885
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
So, you know, there's that kind of thrown there.

1886
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
A lot of people are holding back their consoles until Black Friday.

1887
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
But yes, there's not like Wii U sitting on the shelves.

1888
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Trust me, they're nowhere at all.

1889
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
And how did the Xbox 360 sell in its first week?

1890
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I mean, those things were fucking diamonds to find when they originally came out.

1891
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Remember the Xbox 360 launch and how shitty it was?

1892
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Like, those things were really hard to find,

1893
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
so I would bet their sales numbers were not so hot,

1894
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
and a lot of that was because of supply and demand as well.

1895
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So, I think it's comparing apples to oranges a little bit.

1896
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Well, and also that's a little bit different, too,

1897
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
because, you know, you're talking about a real generation jump there.

1898
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
It's the first next-gen console.

1899
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Whereas the Wii U is kind of like, it's not really a next-gen console.

1900
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
I mean, the graphics aren't like,

1901
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
oh my god, this is like way different than what I'm seeing on the other consoles.

1902
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
It's just...

1903
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It's Nintendo doing its thing.

1904
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yeah.

1905
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So, it doesn't have the same impact, I guess.

1906
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So, yeah, you can't compare those sales numbers.

1907
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I would say look at it, you know,

1908
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
how are the Wii U's selling six months from now?

1909
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
That'll be telling.

1910
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Basically, it looks like this.

1911
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
If all of a sudden, you know,

1912
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Wii's start getting a bunch in stock, like, right away,

1913
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
then that's a problem, because then that means that they're sitting...

1914
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
that there's no demand at the stores.

1915
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
They are still showing up at the...

1916
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Speaking of Twitter, haha,

1917
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I just saw a picture of a bunch of them sitting at a Best Buy

1918
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
that somebody took a picture of.

1919
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
So, I mean, they are being replenished out there,

1920
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
so don't think you won't have one for the holidays if you don't want one.

1921
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
You can still find them.

1922
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Even if GameStop got rid of their call list or whatever the hell that was.

1923
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Don't go to GameStop.

1924
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Yeah, just don't go to GameStop.

1925
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Seriously, because I remember it was when I got the PSP.

1926
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I don't even know if you were with me or not.

1927
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I don't think you were.

1928
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
But no, it was when I got the PSP,

1929
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I went to GameStop, and they're like,

1930
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
oh, good luck finding one of those.

1931
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
You'll never find a PSP.

1932
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Went to Best Buy.

1933
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
They had a whole case of them sitting there.

1934
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
So...

1935
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Yeah, I hate the attitude of a lot of people I've seen working there.

1936
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
So if you didn't pre-order, you're never going to get that.

1937
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Yeah.

1938
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
No, that's not true.

1939
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Try me, bitch.

1940
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Or the games.

1941
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I'm not going to get them on release day if I don't pre-order.

1942
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Amazon.com.

1943
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Pwned.

1944
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Like, be aware of what you're really competing with, people.

1945
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Anywhere else.

1946
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Moving on.

1947
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Dark Sakura.

1948
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Well, we can move on to other news.

1949
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
How about Steam's Greenlight?

1950
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
There's a third batch of games being accepted.

1951
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And it actually looks a little bit like Primordia.

1952
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
The other one is Walking Mars.

1953
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
But Primordia is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi game

1954
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,000
that Valve actually rejected after several indie titles were pulled in.

1955
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And then the other one was Walking Mars done by Tigerstyle.

1956
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,000
It was an OS game and it made App of the Day back for Eurogamer.

1957
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Don't know if anyone remembers that.

1958
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I think I'm the only one here that follows Eurogamer.

1959
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I read a review of theirs today.

1960
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I couldn't understand why I didn't jive up with what the rest of the internet was saying.

1961
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But the now full games on the list is Black Space, DarkFoil and Holy Wars, Dawn of Fantasy,

1962
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Dragon's Lair, Eurotruck Simulator 2, Gear Up, Kinetic Void Space Adventure,

1963
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:34,000
The Light, No Time to Explain, Primordia, Sangfroid, Tales of Werewolves, Starforge and Walking Mars.

1964
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So, pretty good.

1965
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Loki?

1966
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
So the Ouya is making progress.

1967
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,000
They announced that they're going to be able to start shipping consoles December 28th.

1968
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Now, it's not necessarily consoles to users,

1969
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
but those are development kits that are going to be going out

1970
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
for any developers that want to start making games for it.

1971
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
And basically, I forget how much money you have to donate

1972
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:08,000
or contribute for Kickstarter in order to get one of those.

1973
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
It was a few hundred dollars.

1974
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
But those people are going to be getting their consoles soon.

1975
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
And it sounds like everything is going as planned.

1976
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And man, that thing is tiny.

1977
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
It has a tiny console.

1978
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
It's like a Rubik's Cube size.

1979
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So that's going to be pretty sweet when that comes out.

1980
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Still targeting March as a release.

1981
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:36,000
And of course, right now they're saying that you can download the official development kit

1982
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
if you haven't gotten your console yet and you can start working on stuff

1983
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
and then they're going to be updating that stuff later on.

1984
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I think I want to say that every console is going to be coming with a dev kit

1985
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
or some sort of way where you can make your own.

1986
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:56,000
If they're so open, I don't see why they wouldn't all function as dev kits in a way.

1987
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I think they will. It's just these consoles are a little bit earlier.

1988
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
But yeah, it's going to be interesting.

1989
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
So it's really happening?

1990
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
It's really happening.

1991
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Because when the whole Ouya thing first happened, there were a lot of people saying,

1992
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
and I may or may not have said this myself, sure it'll happen.

1993
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
If you put a story about how it's going to fail and stuff, it gets page hits

1994
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
because people want to read up about...

1995
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
They like watching car crashes.

1996
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
So we'll see.

1997
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
And let's be honest, it's not out yet to everybody.

1998
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
But I wouldn't be surprised if it's delayed past March

1999
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
because a lot of the Kickstars that I've been contributing to,

2000
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
not a lot of them have been on time.

2001
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Like hell, the stuff I got from Freddie Wong and the whole VJHS stuff

2002
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:48,000
arrived just a couple weeks ago versus the targeted date was March.

2003
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
So that's a long delay.

2004
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But I have a little trust that they're going to actually deliver on stuff.

2005
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
It's just not exactly in the timetable that they were talking about.

2006
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
BlackWolf in our chat says,

2007
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I'll believe it when I see it. It still has a chance to fail.

2008
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
The Mayans predicted its failure.

2009
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
True point.

2010
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Some of the Kickstarters I've backed, I've only backed two.

2011
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
But GamerCon, that has to happen on the weekend.

2012
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
They say it's going to happen.

2013
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I know they booked the venue and it's moving forward.

2014
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
So I don't see how that's not going to happen when they say it does.

2015
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
That should be exciting.

2016
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
And then the Shadowgate reboot was the other thing I Kickstarted.

2017
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
So I'm excited to see what comes of that.

2018
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
They send updates all the time.

2019
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I had to stop reading them.

2020
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
They send too many damn updates.

2021
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
They were up to update 29.

2022
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I think it's more than that.

2023
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
The Shadowgate one.

2024
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Did you back that too?

2025
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Yeah, I did. I backed the first one.

2026
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
It was, I don't even remember what updates they have now.

2027
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
But I get updates from a lot of these.

2028
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I've got at least four or five right now that I'm waiting on.

2029
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Oh, here's another update. Let's see who this one is.

2030
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Oh, this is Ouya.

2031
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
The same thing I just talked about.

2032
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
The dead kids are shipping.

2033
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
But yeah, they've got a bunch of updates.

2034
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
In fact, there's this one.

2035
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I like, there's one I did.

2036
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I draw comics sketchbook and reference guide.

2037
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Because it looked awesome.

2038
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
There you go.

2039
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Moving on to another news and rumor type of thing.

2040
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Yoshi's Land rumored for the Wii U.

2041
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,000
And now Best Buy and Future Shop are apparently taking pre-orders for it.

2042
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
This is after the whole Miiverse hack.

2043
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
That's not really a hack, but everybody called it that.

2044
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Where the guy found the page, the mockup that Nintendo pulled and put the statement out on.

2045
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Apparently Best Buy even has a little description of the game for Yoshi's Land.

2046
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Quote, take Yoshi on an epic adventure to remember in Yoshi Land for Nintendo Wii U.

2047
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Check out Yoshi as you've never seen him before in glorious high definition.

2048
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Enjoy dual screen control thanks to the Wii U touch screen game pad.

2049
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Where you'll also be able to experience full integration with Nintendo's Miiverse service.

2050
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Well, that's a whole lot of nothing because anybody could guess that on the title alone.

2051
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
But it's interesting that that exists.

2052
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'll give you some tin foil hatness here if you want.

2053
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I believe Reggie has teased a couple times that maybe we don't really know everything that's going to be in the launch window.

2054
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Maybe there's something else.

2055
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
This could be that something else.

2056
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And speaking of Twitter and promoted posts.

2057
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:28,000
One of the posts that fell on my feed earlier this evening was from Spike TV saying,

2058
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Hey gamers, don't forget to watch the Spike Video Game Awards.

2059
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
More first party exclusive reveals or whatever.

2060
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
More big game reveals.

2061
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,000
We saw Miyamoto come out on stage at the last Spike TV Awards to great reception.

2062
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Maybe, maybe, tin foil hat, Yoshi's Land to be revealed at Spike Gamer Awards.

2063
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Discuss.

2064
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I think it's just a bunch of bullshit that, you know, let's be honest here.

2065
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Of course you do.

2066
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Let's be honest, I mean, GameStop was taking, I'm still seeing if it's on here right now.

2067
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:11,000
GameStop was taking pre-orders for like, what, Pilotwings for the Wii and like Mario Paint.

2068
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
You know, I think they had Mario Paint for like the Wii U and stuff.

2069
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:20,000
There's a whole bunch of TBA stuff that someone gets an idea that there might be something coming out.

2070
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And then they'll put a pre-order for it because guess what?

2071
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,000
That's giving them your money.

2072
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
They're taking a pre-order for a game and if it doesn't come out, hey, guess what?

2073
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:34,000
We've got this credit that you paid for this game and now you can apply this to another game.

2074
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:39,000
It's why companies love gift cards because there's so many people that never spend them.

2075
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Or just, you know, have remaining balances on them that they end up, you know, they throw the card away.

2076
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Oh, it's just a 50 cent balance, just throw it away.

2077
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Well, the company just made 50 cents off you.

2078
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Yeah.

2079
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
You know, and if that happens a thousand times, it starts to become a little bit of money.

2080
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Tigerclaw has a thought that maybe the Spike VGAs will reveal Bungie's new game, which recently had leaked concept art.

2081
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
That's another great thought, actually.

2082
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
They've already said which games are getting reveals, or at least some of them.

2083
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Like The Last of Us, and I don't think it's necessarily revealed, but like a new gameplay thing.

2084
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:32,000
And I'm trying to remember what else was on there. I think maybe Fuse? I don't know.

2085
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I watched the little trailer that they had with Samuel L. Jackson as a baby. That was weird.

2086
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Eh. I didn't watch any of it. I'm just gonna wait until five minutes after the show's over, and then everything shows up on YouTube.

2087
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
That's all I need. I just want the YouTubes with the reveals.

2088
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Kind of like the year that Skyrim was announced. YouTube.

2089
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Do you think maybe a new Batman game will be announced?

2090
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
God, I hope not.

2091
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
It could be, but what are you talking about? Bite your tongue.

2092
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Arkham City was amazing. You know where you can put that thumb.

2093
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Alright, let's move on. Loki gave me a thumbs down.

2094
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
You really hate Arkham City?

2095
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I don't hate it. I've never played it. But I just don't want to see another...

2096
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
You don't know shit! Shut up!

2097
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I don't want to see another Batman game. I think it's stupid.

2098
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Oh my God. Oh, this conversation. I can't talk to you.

2099
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Why would you have another Batman game when they just released one last year?

2100
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I mean, seriously, what is it again? Batman Arkham State! Oh, the whole state is a prison now!

2101
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I think they had joked they were going to call it Arkham World, but that didn't...

2102
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Arkham World?

2103
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
That didn't actually mean...

2104
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Hey, I have an idea. Let's get Snake Pliston in here. He'll fucking escape from New York.

2105
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Oh wait, but it's going to be Batman instead. But hey, whatever. We'll just rip it off. It'll be fun.

2106
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
It doesn't actually mean world, dummy.

2107
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
We're going to see how many more Batman villains we can shove in here.

2108
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Hey, is there any other obscure Batman villains that we haven't tackled yet?

2109
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
You know, maybe we can just get Lex Luthor in there because we're running out of Batman villains.

2110
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Your opinion does not even count! You haven't even played the game!

2111
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
You lose! Good day, sir!

2112
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I am totally enjoying this. I'm just sitting back going, mm-hmm.

2113
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
He's an idiot! Tell him!

2114
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Rob thinks you're an idiot.

2115
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Cool. I don't care what Rob thinks.

2116
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Well, we care what you think.

2117
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails, you know, if you want to call low-key an idiot.

2118
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.

2119
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
You know what? I'm such an idiot because I actually don't have the mailbag pulled up.

2120
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Dark Soccer, you're an idiot too! I'm surrounded by idiots!

2121
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I am not!

2122
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
No, you're surrounded by assholes. It's different.

2123
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I'm going to go play Arkham City.

2124
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Hold on, I'm pulling it up.

2125
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:57,000
It's just, I've been sort of doing some damage management of a severe nature.

2126
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Okay.

2127
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Sorry, I'm pulling up the email now.

2128
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Alright.

2129
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I want gossip, girl. You gotta tell me about this after the email bag.

2130
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
TigerClawn.

2131
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I played Arkham Asylum at E3.

2132
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
You know what game I hate? Earth Defense Force.

2133
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
That's fine.

2134
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Oh, lord.

2135
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
See, now you're just trolling.

2136
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
It's for bros. Oh, I've never played it.

2137
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Now you're just trolling.

2138
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
They see you trolling, they're hating.

2139
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Well, we only have one email.

2140
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Okay.

2141
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Hello, OLR. Another email from Belgium here.

2142
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Yay, Belgium!

2143
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Since Sony is doing so bad, I've been thinking lately, do you guys think Sony will have enough resources to launch a decent next-gen system?

2144
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,000
It costs billions of dollars to develop and launch a new console and they don't have that kind of money.

2145
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I think they do.

2146
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Also, with their rating dropping, banks will be less eager to loan the money.

2147
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I believe Nintendo made the Wii technologically inferior because of money problems, or is this wrong?

2148
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
You know what?

2149
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
That's a damn good point.

2150
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I don't know.

2151
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
It could be, the PlayStation 4 could end up being a bunch of smoke and mirrors, too.

2152
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:12,000
It could be that, you know, this whole tech with the controller changing or whatever may be the big thing,

2153
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
and it's not really that souped up of a system.

2154
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I kind of think the internet would crucify them if that happened.

2155
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Honestly, someone trying to separate their controller that they have right now.

2156
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I broke my controller, I split it in two, and it's not working like I saw in the picture.

2157
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I've said this before and I'll say it again.

2158
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I don't think Sony has to launch a new console next year.

2159
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Why not sell more PlayStation 3s by putting out amazing games?

2160
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:42,000
You know, I realize a lot of people expect Sony to put out a console next year because of what Microsoft is doing, but...

2161
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I don't even know if Microsoft's putting out a console next year.

2162
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
That's all, yeah, that's all...

2163
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Remember, we're just listening to analysts that are speaking out of their ass.

2164
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
That's right.

2165
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Anal.

2166
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Also, I'll go ahead and read it.

2167
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Also, I'd like to ask if you guys would plug the volunteering I do for a local playground.

2168
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
I posted a thread in an off-topic part of the forum called,

2169
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Can you please vote for us on a website?

2170
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And that's on our VOG forum, so you can look for it.

2171
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:13,000
We have a chance to win, I guess it's 2,000 euros if we get the most votes.

2172
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,000
As always, thanks a lot for making a new episode every week.

2173
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
You rock.

2174
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
P.S. if we win the contest, I'll send you a box of Belgian chocolates.

2175
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Ooh, deal.

2176
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Totally, as long as they're dark chocolate.

2177
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Go vote now.

2178
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I'm gonna share this with the chat room.

2179
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
It is a playground, it's volunteer.

2180
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
It's for a good cause.

2181
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
We totally support this.

2182
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
We like games of all sorts.

2183
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Including the ones you play outdoors.

2184
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
So, good luck buddy, I hope you win.

2185
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
And yes to the chocolate.

2186
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
By the way, you'll love this idea.

2187
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Or maybe you won't, I don't know.

2188
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
But, um, Sil from Girls Gone Wow.

2189
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I love Sil.

2190
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I love her too, she's so great.

2191
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
But, uh, we were talking to each other on Facebook.

2192
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
And we're gonna do a candy exchange.

2193
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Where she's gonna send me candy from the UK that you can't get here.

2194
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
And I'm gonna send her stuff from the US that we all take for granted that you can't get over there.

2195
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I guess, like, Pop-Tarts?

2196
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
You can't get in the UK?

2197
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Peanut butter.

2198
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Really?

2199
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Yeah.

2200
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?

2201
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Rob, they use Marmite.

2202
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Ugh.

2203
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Ugh.

2204
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Weird.

2205
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
You know what?

2206
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Um, I did a candy exchange with, um, with, uh, Robert K.

2207
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And he sent me...

2208
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Now, sadly, I was allergic to the candy that he sent me because I can't eat gummies.

2209
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Don't.

2210
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
But I sent...

2211
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I would've eaten it.

2212
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I brought it, remember?

2213
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
The Jelly Babies and stuff?

2214
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
That's right, you did.

2215
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

2216
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:38,000
But, um, I sent a bunch of these, um, Baskin-Robbins candies that were these hard candies flavored

2217
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
like Baskin-Robbins ice creams.

2218
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Oh, yeah.

2219
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
I remember those.

2220
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Those are good.

2221
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
And he said he really liked them.

2222
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I also sent him cans of salsa.

2223
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Is that something you can't get over there?

2224
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I'm not sure you can get salsa.

2225
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,460
Just, this was actually, like, the, uh, the, uh, what's, what's the Mexican, um, grocery

2226
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:54,460
stores called?

2227
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:57,120
Um, oh, God.

2228
02:03:57,120 --> 02:03:59,120
No, this was actually, like, authentic.

2229
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:01,280
Yeah, down, down in L.A. you see them everywhere.

2230
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,280
I can't remember the name of it.

2231
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:03,280
Carson something?

2232
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,280
Yeah, yeah.

2233
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:05,280
Carcinogen.

2234
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:09,760
Well, okay, what's funny is that Sil linked me to a website that, you know, I would never

2235
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:15,160
look this shit up, but it's a store in the U.K. that sells American imported goods.

2236
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:18,720
And it was just hilarious looking at the stuff they were advertising on the site, like Captain

2237
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:19,720
Crunch.

2238
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:21,920
I'm like, oh, I take that shit for granted that you can just get Captain Crunch at the

2239
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,280
grocery store here.

2240
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:28,640
And even speaking of, like, Mexico, you could get, cause how easy is it to get yarritos?

2241
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,840
The soda, right?

2242
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,840
Here it is.

2243
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:33,320
I'd never saw one until I moved out here.

2244
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:36,720
But especially, like, even at Target and stuff, you can get, like, the quote unquote Mexican

2245
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:37,720
Coke.

2246
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,720
It's very easy to get.

2247
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:39,720
They have a whole little wall.

2248
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:42,760
Well, I'll tell you what, you see it a lot during Passover because it's not made with

2249
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:43,760
corn syrup.

2250
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,760
Ah, very true.

2251
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,560
And corn is considered not kosher for Passover.

2252
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,040
But you see it all the time at Target.

2253
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,720
Like, Target has their...

2254
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:50,720
Or throwback.

2255
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,320
Jones soda, I guess, is the thing, too, you can't get in the U.K.

2256
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,320
Jones is so good.

2257
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:56,680
It's even kind of hard to find here.

2258
02:04:56,680 --> 02:05:00,960
I wish we could get one of the Thanksgiving boxes and send it over because, you know,

2259
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,240
like the gravy one is weird, but I hear that the cranberry sauce soda is actually really

2260
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:06,240
delicious.

2261
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:07,240
Here's the thing, though.

2262
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:12,320
Cyl says she can't have it till February because she's on a lifestyle adjustment until February,

2263
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,960
so she can't get the candy till then.

2264
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:18,760
But little does she know, she didn't say how big the box had to be.

2265
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:22,800
So I plan on spoiling her because I do really like Cyl.

2266
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:28,720
She's great being a team player with a vog and everything, so she's going to have a lot

2267
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:31,000
of candy coming her way.

2268
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,320
How easy is it to get candy here?

2269
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:37,200
Like I'll just go to Target the day after Christmas, get all that candy.

2270
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,200
It'd be crazy.

2271
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,200
All right.

2272
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,200
Let's move on.

2273
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,200
Enough candy talk.

2274
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,200
That was it for emails, huh?

2275
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:43,200
Just one email tonight?

2276
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,200
Yeah.

2277
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:48,880
Email mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to email us in a future episode.

2278
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:55,920
Meanwhile, it's time for a segment we do every week here on the show, often imitated, never

2279
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:56,920
duplicated.

2280
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:57,920
Haha.

2281
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:58,920
It's the FUs of the week.

2282
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:24,320
Um, FUs to misunderstandings, um, and yeah, I'm doing, um, some damage control.

2283
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:29,600
It's not a big thing, not really, um, it's just, yeah.

2284
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:39,160
Anyway, um, and, uh, also, uh, FUs to, uh, the, what, three inches of water in my backseat

2285
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:40,800
on the passenger side.

2286
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:45,480
Um, there's a seal broken somewhere in my car and yeah, that almost cost me my laptop

2287
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:46,480
once.

2288
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:49,480
So yeah, that sucks.

2289
02:06:49,480 --> 02:07:00,600
Um, I guess FU to, I don't know, I don't know where, I'd rather take the, you know, the

2290
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:10,080
week off and play some far cry three, but, uh, you know, job money, I don't open.

2291
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:15,040
Black Wolf wanted us to clarify that what you're talking about has nothing to do with

2292
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:16,040
fog.

2293
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:17,040
Everything's happy-go-lucky above.

2294
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:25,040
Um, as far as I know, um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to, um, sleeping so much.

2295
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:29,760
Oh my God, you guys is disgusting how much I've slept over this weekend, but I feel great.

2296
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,680
Uh, and FU to the weather.

2297
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:33,920
It's been nonstop shitty for the past three days.

2298
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:34,920
I'm thankful.

2299
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:35,920
It's finally clear enough.

2300
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,920
That makes me for a couple of days.

2301
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:37,920
Shut up.

2302
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:42,720
I don't like for a couple of days though, as long as it's not as bad as I don't mind

2303
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:46,640
like the light rain and all this, but just the constant like shit after shit followed

2304
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:47,980
by more shit.

2305
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,920
And then the warning, it's going to flood shit everywhere.

2306
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:53,040
I put up my Christmas lights to clean out my gutters.

2307
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:58,100
They're released on the tree one night later, all the leaves fell every single one of them

2308
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:01,960
into the gutters like, God damn it.

2309
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:04,680
Why couldn't have been lazy longer?

2310
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:07,600
All right.

2311
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:10,800
Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then we'll open up the Skype line at one

2312
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:11,800
eight seven seven game.

2313
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:12,800
O L R.

2314
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,800
All right.

2315
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:19,720
So there was a, a new Kickstarter for this LA game space and what's kind of unique about

2316
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,720
it.

2317
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:25,520
Um, they're going to be creating some new games to kind of, I guess, go along with this.

2318
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:29,840
And some of the games that they're getting created are actually by some pretty famous

2319
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:34,360
people including, um, they've got the creator of Katamari Damacy.

2320
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:41,960
Um, was it, uh, Keita or Keita, uh, Takahashi Keita Takahashi.

2321
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:47,680
And also they had, uh, Adam Saltzman, who is the guy did a cannibal.

2322
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:51,520
And they're going to be, um, I guess, creating a game for the people that back the project

2323
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:56,600
also, um, to go along with that, they've got some more, um, games being coming or coming

2324
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:57,600
out.

2325
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:01,880
I guess there are going to be 30 new games from different, uh, indie developers are pretty

2326
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:10,680
prominent including, um, stuff by, uh, was it the guy did Hotline Miami, uh, Steve Swink

2327
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:12,520
of Scale.

2328
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:16,600
And also, I guess, uh, the guy that did, uh, Unfinished Swan.

2329
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:22,640
And they're going to get, uh, Pendleton Ward also, um, who did, uh, I guess, he's doing

2330
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:31,920
a game with, um, Banette Foddy who did QWOP and CLOP, which I really need to go back and

2331
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:35,880
play because, oh god, CLOP was awesome.

2332
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:41,180
Uh, so yes, they're going to be, if you, um, and that, it's pretty awesome, if you pledge

2333
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:43,560
$15 or more you get those 30 games.

2334
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:45,120
So that's pretty awesome.

2335
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:51,440
And $5 or more and you get that one game that's being done by, um, the two first guys I mentioned.

2336
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:53,680
So definitely check it out.

2337
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:57,200
They're probably going to hit their goal because they're looking for $250,000.

2338
02:09:57,200 --> 02:10:00,600
They have four days left to go and they're at $234,000, so.

2339
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:01,600
I think they'll be okay.

2340
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,600
I think they'll be alright.

2341
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:05,920
Although, although there was another one I did see that they were looking for $50,000,

2342
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,760
they missed it by $28.

2343
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:09,480
Oh ho ho.

2344
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:10,840
And if you don't make it, you get none of it.

2345
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:11,840
You get none of it.

2346
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,840
You can try again.

2347
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:13,840
Ouch.

2348
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:14,840
Yeah, that's true.

2349
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:20,200
Alright, well, lastly tonight, before we go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR and the Twitter

2350
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:23,680
at twitter.com slash O-L-R, this is a bit of a visual.

2351
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:26,440
I apologize guys, but you can Google this.

2352
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:33,680
The cover of the final Nintendo Power has been released and it is awesomely nostalgic.

2353
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:36,040
I think it's a perfect send off to the magazine.

2354
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:37,980
It ends the way it began.

2355
02:10:37,980 --> 02:10:42,920
The final cover looks a lot like the first cover only instead of, you know, the very

2356
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:46,140
first cover in Nintendo Power was Super Mario 2.

2357
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:49,480
And so you have Wart in the background and you have like the vegetables cause that was

2358
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:51,400
a big part of Mario 2.

2359
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:56,840
The final cover of Nintendo Power is for New Super Mario Brothers U with Bowser in the

2360
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:02,720
background and Goombas, but still just the very similar, you know, look.

2361
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:06,600
You clearly get the reference here if you've been a fan of Nintendo Power.

2362
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:09,960
Also what's very interesting when you put the two covers side by side, you really notice

2363
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:14,800
that on that first cover of Nintendo Power, Mario's color palette was wrong.

2364
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,800
It was reversed.

2365
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,800
Yeah.

2366
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:21,200
The blue overalls is right and the red shirt, but his hat, his hat's wrong.

2367
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:26,600
So kind of interesting that that's all screwed up, but regardless, a great send off and even

2368
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:30,800
like the same colors as a designer Dark Sakura doesn't make you happy.

2369
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,360
Yeah, for the most part.

2370
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:36,280
I mean, it's actually a lot better laid out.

2371
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,280
It's more dynamic.

2372
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:38,280
I'll say that.

2373
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:43,780
But then again, the Nintendo Power logo, the new one also lends itself to a bit more dynamic

2374
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:45,880
because of the differences in size.

2375
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:50,360
I also just like, like even the little POW is the same, the little POW poster inside.

2376
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:51,600
Poster inside is like the same.

2377
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:52,700
I love it.

2378
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:55,880
So it makes me sad to see Nintendo Power go.

2379
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:58,680
But then again, if I was going to be that sad, I wouldn't have stopped reading it about

2380
02:11:58,680 --> 02:11:59,840
like 15 years ago.

2381
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:03,080
Sorry not to be Debbie Downer, but that's the reason why the magazines are going out

2382
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:04,220
of business.

2383
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:09,160
So hopefully there'll be something else in the future, maybe a newsstand app on the iPhone

2384
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:10,160
or something.

2385
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:12,560
I don't know, but we'll see.

2386
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,160
Anyhow, let's go to the phones.

2387
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:20,080
One eight seven seven game O.L.R. or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

2388
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:25,440
Oh, act deft catches this in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com, pointing

2389
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:30,280
out the last issue has Mario going to the pole, meaning the end.

2390
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:32,200
I didn't even catch that.

2391
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:35,240
It looked like the halfway point flagged me, but going to the pole because that's where

2392
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:37,840
he's going to work from now on.

2393
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:42,040
On the pole, the whole Mario is not going to the pole.

2394
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:43,040
Whole new era.

2395
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,440
Mario is not going to the pole.

2396
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:46,360
Those games still sell like crazy.

2397
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:50,040
I guarantee besides Nintendo Land is the top selling Wii U game right now.

2398
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:53,320
Yeah, but what's what's the way you're going to expand your demographic into the stripper

2399
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:57,920
market than getting, you know, strippers in your games?

2400
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:02,400
Yes, because that's exactly what they need to get at Nintendo is strippers.

2401
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,040
I think I need strippers now.

2402
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:05,680
I think they should.

2403
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,400
All right.

2404
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:12,240
Again, the phones one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or a username on Skype is orange lounge

2405
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:13,240
radio.

2406
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:16,840
Before I get to the Twitter's, Loki, do you have any last minute?

2407
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:20,400
Yeah, they have got some cool plug ins for Gary's mod.

2408
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:25,440
It's coming out December six and it's basically a Kinect PC plug in.

2409
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:30,120
You'll be able to do body capture using the Kinect.

2410
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:34,000
You're going to need Kinect for Windows runtime version one point six.

2411
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,800
But you're going to be able to do all sorts of funny stuff with Gary's mod with that.

2412
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,800
All right.

2413
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:41,800
Let's go to the phones.

2414
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:42,800
We have a call coming in.

2415
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,800
Hi.

2416
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:44,800
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2417
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:45,800
Who's this?

2418
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:47,440
He's like, oh, we see you tonight.

2419
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,760
Yes, because I have a webcam now.

2420
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:50,760
You sure do.

2421
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:51,760
All right.

2422
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:52,760
What's on your mind, buddy?

2423
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,760
You know, I need to get a webcam.

2424
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,760
Still need one.

2425
02:13:54,760 --> 02:14:01,960
I know you have a question the week so on the face of my Facebook news feed earlier

2426
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:03,960
today and get a chance to answer it.

2427
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:06,900
But there is one thing I am looking forward.

2428
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:13,200
This holiday season is supposed to PS3 that my girlfriend is hinting at.

2429
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:14,200
So I am.

2430
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:16,920
In other words, a new system is probably on my way.

2431
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:17,920
Lucky you.

2432
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:24,020
Well, I mean, it makes it for the fact that I got her car stereo and the other Hanukkah

2433
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:27,620
present that will be forthcoming.

2434
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:28,620
You can't give it.

2435
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:29,620
You never know.

2436
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:30,640
She might be a listener of this program.

2437
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:32,400
You don't want to give it all away.

2438
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:35,280
Well, actually, she doesn't listen to this.

2439
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:42,600
I mean, video games is only a small fraction of her life aside from taking care of wildlife

2440
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:45,880
and watching anime and British dramas.

2441
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:52,760
But yeah, now that I am going to presume that I am definitely getting a PS3 this holiday

2442
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:56,680
season, I am just trying to see where to begin from there.

2443
02:14:56,680 --> 02:15:01,480
Because this is like the first time I am getting a new system since I got my 360.

2444
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:05,920
Well, I was just about to ask you, if let's say you are right on your hunch and you do

2445
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:09,440
end up getting a PlayStation 3, what do you think you are going to get?

2446
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:14,160
I am probably going to get the games that I were hinting at, stuff like Gran Turismo

2447
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:22,760
5, Metal Gear Solid 4, the Uncharted series, so pretty much all of the PS3 exclusives.

2448
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:26,560
Because there is no way I am going to get any other multi-platform game that I would

2449
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:28,600
otherwise get off PC.

2450
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:34,600
I think this goes to the argument that if you compare both Microsoft and Sony in terms

2451
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:44,920
of games that are more first party, it looks like if you compare them side by side aside

2452
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:53,440
from Halo and Forza and Fable, you have a bit more first party titles on Sony's side

2453
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:55,560
than you would in Microsoft.

2454
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:58,120
Anything in between is just multi-platform.

2455
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:02,040
Since it came up earlier, we were talking a lot about how Sony has a lot of great download

2456
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,880
stuff on PSN that people are overlooking.

2457
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:09,280
Do you have any interest in Journey or the Swann game or Unfinished Swann or any of that

2458
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:10,280
stuff?

2459
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:12,160
Yeah, I would have to.

2460
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:13,840
I am definitely looking forward to it.

2461
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:20,320
I am looking forward to Home in particular and seeing what that thing is about.

2462
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:23,760
More importantly, I guess after I get the PS3, then I have to figure out which high

2463
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:29,720
def TV I am looking for because I am putting it off, to be honest, trying to find something

2464
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:35,400
that is really fast, that is under one frame of black.

2465
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:42,440
For my rhythm and dancing games, I need something really fast and it can't be a fighting game.

2466
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:46,400
I am really holding off until I find something, something that is tried and true that others

2467
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:52,720
have used with certainty that I can easily buy in my local Best Buy that same day.

2468
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:56,880
Most of the TVs now, as long as you are not buying a bargain basement TV, most of the

2469
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:59,680
TVs now you are not going to have a problem with that.

2470
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:03,720
The technology is much better now and you don't really have that same type of lag.

2471
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:09,480
They know that people want HDTVs to play video games, so a lot of them advertise very low

2472
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:10,480
lag.

2473
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:15,640
Right, but that is contrary to what I am hearing in the Shoryuken forums on the big fighting

2474
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:18,320
game community site.

2475
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:28,000
In their tech talk section, they do have threads for sub one frame high def TVs.

2476
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:33,600
Most of them are either available or they are just discontinued, but for the most part

2477
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:36,760
it is monitors that are damn near lagless.

2478
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:40,260
You have some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2479
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:44,980
Shining Force 3inator, hey that name is going to get you arrested, says, I put up a thread

2480
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:49,220
on the vlog boards with some PS3, PSN recommendations.

2481
02:17:49,220 --> 02:17:51,780
Brad from Pod Culture is suggesting a Vizio.

2482
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:57,140
Go Vizio, it is the best bang for your buck, not at Best Buy, Wally World or Costco.

2483
02:17:57,140 --> 02:17:59,340
I am not going to Wal-Mart.

2484
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:00,340
I got mine at Costco.

2485
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:02,340
I actually had a great experience at Costco, I can't complain.

2486
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:09,860
I just need something that I can play 2DX on in an occasional fight game that is fast

2487
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:14,500
that I don't have to offset for timing.

2488
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:17,220
And then I would pick up a high FTV amount on my wall.

2489
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:21,740
And then maybe someday Konami will put out, now that they have gone HD with 2DX, they

2490
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:26,000
will actually put out all they have missed on like one Uber Playstation 3 game, at least

2491
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
we can dream.

2492
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Sure.

2493
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Sure.

2494
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Right.

2495
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,060
And that is the day when like pigs fly from the skyline.

2496
02:18:33,060 --> 02:18:34,060
Exactly.

2497
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:36,540
That is the day when Rock Revolution 2 is announced.

2498
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:40,180
Alright Zaku, I got to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call and I hope

2499
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:41,180
you do get the PS3.

2500
02:18:41,180 --> 02:18:42,180
Good luck.

2501
02:18:42,180 --> 02:18:43,180
Alright.

2502
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:45,180
Alright, take care buddy.

2503
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:46,180
Bye.

2504
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:48,820
I like the video.

2505
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:52,980
I want more people to call in with video even though it is a radio show, at least I am amused.

2506
02:18:52,980 --> 02:18:55,820
But please, for the love of God, make sure you are decent if you are going to call in

2507
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:56,820
on video.

2508
02:18:56,820 --> 02:19:02,140
Alright, Loki, any other stories?

2509
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:06,300
Microsoft Vancouver is now Black Tusk Studios and apparently they are working on the next

2510
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:08,060
big franchise for the Xbox.

2511
02:19:08,060 --> 02:19:11,220
Oh, like something for the new Xbox maybe?

2512
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:15,260
Just whatever the next big AAA franchise is going to be.

2513
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:18,340
What could it be?

2514
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:22,500
Going to the Twitters at Twitter.com slash OLR, Spazinator wants to know, what are the

2515
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:26,060
odds of a Gangnam style parody with a Mass Effect theme?

2516
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:27,060
Garris style anyone?

2517
02:19:27,060 --> 02:19:28,260
You mean that hasn't already been done?

2518
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:29,260
That could easily be done.

2519
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:30,260
It has been done.

2520
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:32,260
Check out, there is this thing called Tumblr.

2521
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:36,900
I was going to say, it is definitely possible now that they have the JibJab app or whatever

2522
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:40,220
you can upload pictures of people.

2523
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:46,540
So true story, the other day I was looking up YouTube videos and I found myself on Psy

2524
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:49,540
and I was like, I wonder if his other music is any good and I was looking at one of his

2525
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:52,340
other songs and I was like alright, that's kind of cool.

2526
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:53,340
Passionate Goodbye is really good.

2527
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:57,540
And then if you look on the right side at all the related videos, it was all of these

2528
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:59,900
Psy videos, like Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy.

2529
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:04,580
But then there was this one video towards the top, Hippopotamus takes a massive dump

2530
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:07,580
at the zoo.

2531
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:11,660
Guess which one I clicked?

2532
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:19,260
And I was like, this is more interesting than the Psy video.

2533
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:21,460
Alright.

2534
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:23,620
Did you hear that Glee did Gangnam Style?

2535
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:24,620
Oh God.

2536
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:26,360
Do they actually speak Korean?

2537
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:27,360
I don't know.

2538
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:28,800
I'm sure it's terrible.

2539
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:33,220
When I was discovering Adventure Time last night, after five seasons of not ever watching

2540
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:38,600
any of it, I found that someone did an Adventure Time Gangnam Style.

2541
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:39,600
Good Lord.

2542
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,800
Really the one you should look up is the Gangnam Style crossed with Too Legit to Quit with

2543
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,800
NC Hammer.

2544
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:55,600
I'm not sure who's speaking Korean.

2545
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:59,760
That just sounds wrong.

2546
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:00,760
Let's go to the phones.

2547
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:01,960
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2548
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:02,960
Who's this?

2549
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:04,960
This is Haseo Sumuragawa.

2550
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:08,760
Hey, how are you doing?

2551
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,280
I'm doing pretty well.

2552
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:12,280
What's on your mind, Haseo Sumuragawa?

2553
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:23,960
Well, I was putting my plate bid for the trophy course among the listeners.

2554
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:25,680
Wait, wait.

2555
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:29,320
You're putting in your bid for being a trophy whore among the listeners?

2556
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:36,320
Just a small recommendation.

2557
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:43,120
It's supremely cheap to, if you haven't played them yet, to pick up the God of War saga.

2558
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:53,880
Then it's the three main games on disc and you get a download voucher for the PSP collection.

2559
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:57,760
And I bet you can find that pretty cheap these days because that God of War collection

2560
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:59,120
came out a couple years ago.

2561
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:04,040
We actually have it too.

2562
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:09,640
They recently re-released it as the God of War saga because it originally was the God

2563
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:16,760
of War HD collection which was one and two and then that came out right in time for three

2564
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:24,240
or round three and then they came out HD collection which was Change of Olympus and

2565
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:25,240
Ghost of Sparta.

2566
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:29,800
But with the God of War saga, you get all five games.

2567
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:31,840
So you say you're the resident trophy whore.

2568
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:34,080
What is your PlayStation level?

2569
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,280
14.

2570
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:37,280
That's pretty good.

2571
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:41,440
I think I'm only at like seven or eight, but I don't, I mean, you know, do you play other

2572
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:47,160
consoles or like just, are you like only Sony in your house?

2573
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:53,880
Only Sony, but you know, I'm thinking about maybe picking up a 360 to check out, you know,

2574
02:22:53,880 --> 02:23:09,480
like the games I miss on 360 such as Halo and Gears of War because I hear good things.

2575
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:13,920
You've been talking a little bit tonight about how a lot of people have been overlooking

2576
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,720
some of the good stuff that Sony's doing.

2577
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:19,460
Like it doesn't seem like a lot of people tend to care about Move and there's so much

2578
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:22,760
good stuff on PlayStation Network that tends to go overlooked.

2579
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:27,640
As somebody who's a bit of a Sony fan, what do you think people are missing by not giving

2580
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:32,120
Sony more credit?

2581
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:41,080
First of all, the first three games such as God of War, Infamous, and the entire series

2582
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:46,040
are all really great series.

2583
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:57,280
And I mean, even like the download games like Journey, as you mentioned earlier, and Flow

2584
02:23:57,280 --> 02:24:01,840
and Flower, they're truly great games.

2585
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:07,520
And not to mention the PS3 has been getting a whole lot of the collections compared to

2586
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:08,520
the 360.

2587
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,520
I gotcha.

2588
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,520
Yeah, it's true.

2589
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:15,840
They put it, they put a lot of that good stuff, like all those collections out on disc.

2590
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:18,520
It makes a good point to like a good starting point.

2591
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:22,840
Like the Journey collection, you know, has Flower and Flow and all that would be a great

2592
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:24,960
starting point for somebody.

2593
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:25,960
Yes.

2594
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:37,680
Plus, with that, I mean, if I remember correctly, because my friend bought it, it was $30 plus

2595
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:44,440
you got a free month of PlayStation Plus and a whole bunch of player IDs and I think even

2596
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:45,440
a theme.

2597
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:46,440
Nice.

2598
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:47,440
Very cool.

2599
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:48,440
All right.

2600
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:55,600
Well, before we let you go, is there anything else you want to share with us tonight?

2601
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:58,560
No, the coin's revenge could have been better.

2602
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:01,360
How so?

2603
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:07,360
It was too short and they kind of ended it a different way than I was expecting.

2604
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:08,360
All right.

2605
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:10,360
Well, no giving away the ending.

2606
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:11,360
All right.

2607
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:12,360
Well, take care, buddy.

2608
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:13,360
Thanks a lot for the call.

2609
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:14,360
No problem.

2610
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:15,360
All right.

2611
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:16,360
Bye bye.

2612
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:21,640
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2613
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:25,160
Somebody there is sticking up for the PlayStation 3 and giving some more recommendations there.

2614
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:28,440
For the record, I have to say Meg C and Kristin say hi.

2615
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:32,720
Hello and please ask when they're coming to California because we miss them.

2616
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:33,720
Okay, I will.

2617
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:37,560
There is a whole new generation of OLR listeners that have no idea who the OLR lesbians are

2618
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,780
and they need to be introduced.

2619
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:39,780
They need to return.

2620
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:41,280
That's right.

2621
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,760
Remind them the episode 500 is coming up.

2622
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,760
All right.

2623
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,080
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2624
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:52,880
A couple of tweets from SSJ100Matt.

2625
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:55,240
An idea ahead of its time from Sega.

2626
02:25:55,240 --> 02:26:00,840
Arcade Heroes takes a look back at the Sega Super Circuit from 1989.

2627
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:07,640
It links us to a story from Arcade Heroes, which I'll get to in a minute after this call.

2628
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:09,800
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2629
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:10,800
Who's this?

2630
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:11,800
Word, dog.

2631
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:12,800
It's Jim Sally.

2632
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:13,800
Holy crap.

2633
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:14,800
Holy crap.

2634
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:15,800
It's video.

2635
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:16,800
Oh my God.

2636
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:17,800
Jim Sally's on the video.

2637
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:18,800
Are you in the bathroom?

2638
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:22,440
It's just with him moving back and forth and all that.

2639
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:23,440
Well, no.

2640
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:24,440
That wall looks like tile, like bathroom.

2641
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:25,440
Oh no.

2642
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:26,440
It's, I see.

2643
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:28,440
It did have a little bit of that vibe of the sitting on the toilet video.

2644
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:29,440
Sitting on the toilet.

2645
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:30,440
Oh my.

2646
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:31,440
Dude, you're on a roof.

2647
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:32,440
It's the Canadian skyline.

2648
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:33,440
He's outdoors smoking.

2649
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:34,440
That's what they do in Canada.

2650
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:35,440
I don't know what I'm doing.

2651
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:36,440
This could be anything.

2652
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:37,440
Those might give you cancer.

2653
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:38,440
All right.

2654
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:39,440
No, it's organic.

2655
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:40,440
Oh, it's a toothpick.

2656
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:41,440
Oh, it's floss.

2657
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:42,440
Clearly.

2658
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:43,440
It's a toothpick.

2659
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,440
It's a toothpick.

2660
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:45,440
It's a toothpick.

2661
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:46,440
It's a toothpick.

2662
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,440
It's a toothpick.

2663
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:48,440
It's a toothpick.

2664
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:52,920
That's clearly, all right, so that means that he has wonderful, a dental hygiene or

2665
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:53,920
something.

2666
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:54,920
All right.

2667
02:26:54,920 --> 02:26:55,920
Jim Sally.

2668
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:57,840
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2669
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:58,840
Not much, man.

2670
02:26:58,840 --> 02:26:59,840
It's a long time.

2671
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:00,840
No C. I thought I'd call in say what's up.

2672
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:01,840
So you make sure things.

2673
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,520
Okay, I'm doing my, I'm doing my time to get here, man.

2674
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:09,200
Look, I'm all dressed up for the occasion looking fly.

2675
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,200
Thank you.

2676
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,620
Thank you for wearing clothes.

2677
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:14,600
When you call it to the show.

2678
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:15,600
Cause I'm afraid.

2679
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,760
One of these days I am disappointed at the, no, I'm kidding.

2680
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:18,760
Stop.

2681
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:19,760
I'm afraid that one.

2682
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:20,760
Dude, look at those guns.

2683
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:24,140
Jim, it's a radio show.

2684
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:25,640
They're not going to be able to see your muscles.

2685
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:27,640
That was just for you Rob.

2686
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:29,840
He's invited us to the gun show.

2687
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:32,040
You know what I'm saying?

2688
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:33,700
Here's my fan boy hearts and eyes.

2689
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:35,480
I wish we don't have a webcam in return.

2690
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:36,680
I can't, we'll get one.

2691
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:37,680
We're going to get a webcam.

2692
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:41,920
I like to just hear your soft voice anyway, buddy.

2693
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:45,080
The webcam is at my house.

2694
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:49,760
Looks like I'm looking at you in the, in the studio right now.

2695
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:50,760
Here's me.

2696
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:54,540
I'm going to give you a kiss on the cheek.

2697
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:56,840
This is great radio guys.

2698
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:57,840
Great radio.

2699
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:58,840
Smiley.

2700
02:27:58,840 --> 02:27:59,840
I am.

2701
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:00,840
Okay.

2702
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:01,840
Let's do radio.

2703
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,840
Let's do radio.

2704
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:03,840
Let's go.

2705
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:04,840
Jim, what kind of games have you been into lately?

2706
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:05,840
Oh man.

2707
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:07,040
You guys talked about the golden accent too long ago.

2708
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,080
The great golden X game on the Sega.

2709
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:12,520
Oh, I do remember playing that game and being vicious with my friends.

2710
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:16,800
We used to play only two players at a time you could have, but there was three of us.

2711
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:19,400
So whoever died would have to hand the controller off to the guy sitting out.

2712
02:28:19,400 --> 02:28:22,080
And that was pretty much how we played the game the whole time.

2713
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,480
There were a lot of punch buggies, man.

2714
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:26,720
We used to freak out when those little trolls would come out and who got to kill the trolls.

2715
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:30,280
We would usually kill each other and then never get to the second level.

2716
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:33,920
That's a hilarious style of gaming I haven't seen since I was young.

2717
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:37,520
But yeah, we used to do that too with like Mario brothers is that up you died, hand off

2718
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:38,520
the controller.

2719
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:39,520
That's right.

2720
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:40,520
Someone else's turn.

2721
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:41,520
I think that's from the arcade, right?

2722
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:42,520
Because you die.

2723
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:43,640
Someone else gets to put a quarter in.

2724
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:44,640
That's true.

2725
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:47,640
It's very true.

2726
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:48,640
Good times of gold night.

2727
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:51,240
You know, I was thinking back when dark soccer was talking about golden X and I was like,

2728
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:57,640
you know, all things considered golden X actually wasn't very good, but when we were younger,

2729
02:28:57,640 --> 02:28:58,640
it was the shit.

2730
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:03,320
And it was so much fun to play in the arcades and not to spoil a 20 year old game or whatever,

2731
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:07,280
but the ending was great with all the characters actually jumping out of the arcade machine.

2732
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:08,280
Remember that?

2733
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:09,280
That was hilarious.

2734
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:10,280
That was an awesome ending.

2735
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:11,280
It was very-

2736
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:12,280
So worth it.

2737
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:13,280
Fourth wall.

2738
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,520
Oh my God.

2739
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:17,000
He has a hat that says Jim Sally.

2740
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,360
It says, dude, I have a whole line of hats that say Jim Sally.

2741
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:20,360
Here, check it out.

2742
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:24,160
Is that like a clothing line we can check out on, on a cafe press?

2743
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:27,160
You have to tell me what texture you're using because it looks kind of like Cooper, but

2744
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:28,160
not really.

2745
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,720
Um, I think that this was like jungle use or something.

2746
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:31,720
I don't know.

2747
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:34,760
I use different texts, whatever they have at the, I use lids.

2748
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:37,840
You need to do a Helvetica one and make it look extra design.

2749
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:40,120
This show is getting too nerdy for me.

2750
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:42,600
Um, Rob just doesn't know typography.

2751
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:46,120
I love though that we're getting a little glimpse of Canadian right there.

2752
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:48,080
I hope you don't get, is that snow on the ground?

2753
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:49,080
Dude, look at this.

2754
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:51,080
I had to shovel this shit, man.

2755
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:52,080
Oh my.

2756
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:53,080
Just not too long ago.

2757
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,080
Look.

2758
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,080
Yeah dude, it got, it was, it was-

2759
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:56,400
What's that white mythical stuff?

2760
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:57,600
We're from California.

2761
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:58,600
Like I'm like, Ooh, what is that?

2762
02:29:58,600 --> 02:29:59,600
No.

2763
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,260
Rob, for the record, it does snow in Alabama.

2764
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:05,160
And it does snow 45 minutes up the hill here in California because we are, we are like

2765
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:07,560
two less than two hours away from Lake Tahoe.

2766
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:10,000
So I can handle the cold though.

2767
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,360
Look at what you get when you shovel the snow.

2768
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:12,360
Look at those.

2769
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:13,360
Look at those.

2770
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:14,360
All right.

2771
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:18,680
Jim, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call.

2772
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:19,680
Don't be a stranger.

2773
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:20,680
I'm glad to hear from you.

2774
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:21,840
Listen, I'm glad to hear from you guys too.

2775
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:24,200
And I just want to say that I'm an angel.

2776
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:26,200
Look at this light shining in my face.

2777
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:34,760
I'm coming down for Christmas time and I'm telling you be good to everybody you see because

2778
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:42,520
I'm watching you and I got a big eye, you better look up, you better look up.

2779
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:43,520
All right.

2780
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:45,040
Before this turns into the Blair Witch Project.

2781
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,760
This Jim Sali call is brought to you by toothpicks.

2782
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:48,760
Who knows what's in them?

2783
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:49,760
All right.

2784
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:50,760
Take care, buddy.

2785
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:51,760
Love you, Rob Roberts.

2786
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:52,760
Love you, Loki.

2787
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:53,760
Love you, JB.

2788
02:30:53,760 --> 02:31:03,320
I can tell my husband I kissed another man tonight.

2789
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:09,920
I think video is going to have to be a requirement pretty soon as long as I'm not on it.

2790
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:10,920
It's fine.

2791
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,920
We can point the camera over here.

2792
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:12,920
All right.

2793
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:15,280
No, I think it was a toothpick.

2794
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:17,320
It was something or it was weed.

2795
02:31:17,320 --> 02:31:18,320
I don't know.

2796
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:19,320
All right.

2797
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:21,360
I got more tweets.

2798
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:22,360
Who cares?

2799
02:31:22,360 --> 02:31:24,400
Uh, let's see.

2800
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:25,640
What am I looking at here?

2801
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:26,640
Uh, yes.

2802
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:29,960
This was the tweet that SSG100 Matt sent before that call.

2803
02:31:30,600 --> 02:31:36,920
There's a lot here, but it had to do with RC cars on a track and let me see if I can

2804
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:37,920
open this.

2805
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:42,040
Actually, let me open this on the, um, this is why I should not use my iPad to do Twitter

2806
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:47,080
topics because then I don't have the YouTube hooked up to the stream.

2807
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:48,080
The tubes of you.

2808
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:49,080
I know, right?

2809
02:31:49,080 --> 02:31:50,080
Uh, crap.

2810
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:56,640
No, it'll make a mess.

2811
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:57,760
The joys of live radio.

2812
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:03,360
I'm logging in right now to the right Twitter account cause I, I'm have like four different

2813
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:05,560
Twitter accounts.

2814
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:06,560
Let's go look at this.

2815
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,960
I wanted to look at the YouTube that was attached to this.

2816
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:10,760
Okay, here we go.

2817
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:20,720
What is this?

2818
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:24,600
This is Sega super circuit.

2819
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:30,920
You used deluxe outrun cabinets that allowed players to control an RC car on a large track

2820
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:37,400
that was set up next to the units and using cameras mounted to the cars.

2821
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:39,480
You got a first person view of your vehicle.

2822
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:41,640
That is the best thing ever.

2823
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:42,640
That's pretty awesome.

2824
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:45,060
You know, Dan would flip his shit for this.

2825
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:46,060
This is 1989.

2826
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:48,240
I hope my God, look at the video.

2827
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:49,240
That is so adorable.

2828
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:50,240
Dude.

2829
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:53,040
That is completely flip his shit for this.

2830
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:54,040
Oh my God.

2831
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:56,920
That is so rad.

2832
02:32:56,920 --> 02:33:02,040
And it keeps breaking up when the car runs into the wall.

2833
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,100
That is cool.

2834
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:04,840
It's like you should link that to the listeners.

2835
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:11,840
You really can become a miniature person.

2836
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:12,840
I love that.

2837
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:15,440
Rob, I found a haiku from a friend of mine on tumblr.

2838
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:18,400
We're making Rama work overtime with the tumblr tonight, by the way.

2839
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:21,760
All the links I've been talking about during the show, I'm making Rama put on the tumblr.

2840
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:22,760
So check that out.

2841
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:24,640
That is so cool.

2842
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:27,320
This is actually how I feel about group projects.

2843
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:29,120
So I'm going to read this haiku, Rob.

2844
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:30,120
Okay.

2845
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:31,120
I hate group projects.

2846
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:32,720
Just let me do it myself.

2847
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:35,520
Everyone else sucks.

2848
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:39,320
Everyone else sucks.

2849
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:41,960
Haikus are easy, but sometimes they don't make sense.

2850
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:45,920
Haiku does not take an S to make it plural.

2851
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:50,680
Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion creator, Ron Gilbert, wants the game rights back, according

2852
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:53,800
to another tweet from SSJ100Matt.

2853
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:54,800
Makes sense.

2854
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:57,560
I'm assuming this has to do with the whole Disney acquisition.

2855
02:33:57,560 --> 02:34:02,640
Quote, yeah, I wish I owned Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion, you know.

2856
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:07,800
It just seems to be a company that hoards IP, and that kind of worries me.

2857
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:10,120
Doesn't think that he'll get those franchises back.

2858
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:11,120
Good luck, buddy.

2859
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:12,320
Hope you...

2860
02:34:12,320 --> 02:34:15,000
If they don't give them back to you, I hope it's because they're going to do something

2861
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:18,480
with it, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

2862
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:19,480
Well guess what?

2863
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:20,480
You know what I just did?

2864
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:21,480
What's that?

2865
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:23,360
I signed up for a Mojang account.

2866
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,960
Uh oh.

2867
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:25,960
I'm not buying the game.

2868
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:26,960
Uh oh.

2869
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:27,960
I'm preparing for somebody else to buy me the game.

2870
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:29,200
You need to at least play the beta.

2871
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:30,680
All right.

2872
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:37,160
On the Tiger Claw tweets, hate using the classic controller on the Wii U?

2873
02:34:37,160 --> 02:34:39,280
Use the PlayStation 2s instead.

2874
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:42,400
Apparently there's a conversion kit that's going to be going on sale in Japan that will

2875
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:45,760
allow you to connect a DualShock to the Wii U.

2876
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:49,000
You know, if you don't want to use the classic controller or what have you.

2877
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,000
The kit's from Datel.

2878
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,500
It'll cost about $25 or 1,980 yen.

2879
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:55,960
It goes on sale December 8th.

2880
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:57,960
No idea if this will be sold elsewhere.

2881
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:03,200
That's so cool that you would spend more money on a conversion kit than the actual controller.

2882
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:05,840
Six axis all the things.

2883
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:07,800
All right.

2884
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:08,800
Let's see.

2885
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:15,360
And also from Tiger Claw, Miyamoto wonders, is story really necessary when gameplay will

2886
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,840
do?

2887
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:20,960
Well, just based on title alone, I haven't even looked at the story.

2888
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:26,720
I think an ideal game has both, but Atari 2600 games, I guess, didn't really have a

2889
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:27,720
lot of story.

2890
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,640
Well, they did if you read the instruction manual.

2891
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:35,760
Sometimes you had to to visualize that stuff, but let's see.

2892
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:37,920
This is a link to a story from Gamasutra.

2893
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:41,680
Again, I'm having to read this live because we just got linked to it on Twitter, but looking

2894
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:44,100
at the quote here from Miyamoto.

2895
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:49,280
With regard to the story, we did a survey over the Super Paper Mario game in Club Nintendo,

2896
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,300
and not even 1% said the story was interesting.

2897
02:35:52,300 --> 02:35:56,740
A lot of people said that the flip move for switching between the 3D and the 2D dimensions

2898
02:35:56,740 --> 02:35:58,580
was fun.

2899
02:35:58,580 --> 02:35:59,780
Hmm.

2900
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:01,300
Who's this?

2901
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:05,500
Taro Kudo, the creator of scenario design on the game said, quote, I didn't think we

2902
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:08,380
necessarily needed a lengthy story like in an RPG.

2903
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:12,060
Instead, we looked at the characteristics of a portable game that can be played little

2904
02:36:12,060 --> 02:36:15,980
by little in small pieces and packed in lots of little episodes and ideas.

2905
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:19,540
I always did like putting in little ideas, so I actually enjoyed it.

2906
02:36:19,540 --> 02:36:30,180
A good game doesn't need story, but you know, it's nice to have if the type of genre necessitates

2907
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:31,180
it.

2908
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:35,740
Like, you know, a football game might not necessarily need story, but could a story

2909
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:37,140
make it more awesome?

2910
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:41,500
That's what makes wrestling games awesome, because it's like soap operas for broly dudes.

2911
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:47,580
And lastly, from Degenerate Johnny tonight, OLR, which is faster, running or rolling?

2912
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:51,940
Well, if you're a monk in World of Warcraft, rolling will give you a temporary speed boost

2913
02:36:51,940 --> 02:36:54,100
if you spec the right talent for it.

2914
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:55,100
Dark.

2915
02:36:55,100 --> 02:36:58,660
Depends if it's uphill or downhill.

2916
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:01,260
That's a good question.

2917
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:04,740
If it's a flat surface, I would think running is probably going to be a little faster.

2918
02:37:04,740 --> 02:37:08,300
But yes, if you're going downhill, rolling might actually be more advantageous.

2919
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:10,060
And dangerous.

2920
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:11,380
Consider your terrain.

2921
02:37:11,380 --> 02:37:12,500
Running and rolling.

2922
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:15,020
That was a Street Fighter Alpha 3 ending.

2923
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:17,660
All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2924
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:19,140
That's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight.

2925
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:21,220
Does that do it for Last Minute Stories as well?

2926
02:37:21,220 --> 02:37:22,220
Yes.

2927
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:24,940
And that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2928
02:37:24,940 --> 02:37:27,220
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show.

2929
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:29,700
We really appreciate your guys' support every single week.

2930
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:32,460
Yeah, I know it's a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but you know what?

2931
02:37:32,460 --> 02:37:35,860
The last few have all been like three and a half hour epic episodes.

2932
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:40,940
So you know, a short one as the news is winding down for the year, I don't think is too bad.

2933
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:44,500
We are moving in, of course, to the year end in another year of Orange Lounge Radio.

2934
02:37:44,500 --> 02:37:49,660
And we couldn't have done it for the past coming up on 11 years without your support.

2935
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:53,220
And you know, all we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

2936
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:55,540
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2937
02:37:55,540 --> 02:37:59,800
Word of mouth is all we got, and it's worked out pretty well for us.

2938
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:03,340
Before we pull the plug on the show, it's time to go around and get everybody's final

2939
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:04,860
thoughts tonight.

2940
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:05,860
I'll start.

2941
02:38:05,860 --> 02:38:13,420
Our final thought tonight is, Fog of World is a very interesting app on the iPhone, but

2942
02:38:13,420 --> 02:38:15,260
$5?

2943
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:19,100
Have I just been spoiled by all the 99 cent stuff that's available on IOS?

2944
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:21,100
I think $5 is a little much.

2945
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:23,180
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?

2946
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:27,300
I've decided that if I'm ever going to wear a watch again, it's going to be the Hello

2947
02:38:27,300 --> 02:38:29,300
Kitty Nuka watch.

2948
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:32,420
Nuka makes awesome watches, just saying.

2949
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:36,620
And lastly but not leastly, Loki.

2950
02:38:36,620 --> 02:38:40,660
I hope I get this stupid Mavarina plug-in working, because it's really frustrating me.

2951
02:38:40,660 --> 02:38:43,340
It's giving me a headache.

2952
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:44,340
All right.

2953
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:46,140
That does it for another episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2954
02:38:46,140 --> 02:38:49,300
We will be back to do it all again next week.

2955
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:53,140
And since we learned tonight that it is starting before the next show, happy Hanukkah to our

2956
02:38:53,140 --> 02:38:55,060
listeners out there who celebrate it.

2957
02:38:55,060 --> 02:38:56,060
Yep.

2958
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:57,060
Happy Hanukkah.

2959
02:38:57,060 --> 02:38:58,060
There you go.

2960
02:38:58,060 --> 02:38:59,060
Have a great week, everybody.

2961
02:38:59,060 --> 02:39:00,300
We'll see you next time on Orange.

2962
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:01,300
Eat lots of latkes.

2963
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:03,260
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2964
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:04,260
Feed me gelt.

2965
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:05,260

2966
