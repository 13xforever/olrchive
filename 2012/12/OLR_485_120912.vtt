WEBVTT

00:14.090 --> 00:25.071
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, December 9th, 2012, the Wii U is set to get a Google app, Nintendo blocks mature content during the day in one region, and could Idolmaster finally see a localized release?

00:31.246 --> 00:36.949
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.029 --> 00:45.674
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 485 of our show for this December 9th, 2012.

00:46.495 --> 00:53.599
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and gaming lols with my co-hosts.

00:54.039 --> 00:54.559
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

01:23.931 --> 01:25.834
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, and I gave everybody Hanukkah presents.

01:25.894 --> 01:27.356
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say Mazel Tov!

01:28.097 --> 01:28.798
[SPEAKER_08]: It was delicious.

01:29.198 --> 01:33.564
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew that Rob loves coffee, so I gave him and Alan a bunch of coffee.

01:33.664 --> 01:34.966
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan loves coffee too, that's important.

01:35.106 --> 01:37.369
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was like, what would they both like?

01:37.469 --> 01:39.993
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got them crap tons of Keurig stuff.

01:40.393 --> 01:45.317
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got our other person in the room gift cards.

01:45.558 --> 01:46.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Who I should introduce.

01:46.318 --> 01:47.519
[SPEAKER_11]: Including a Burger King gift card.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:49.461 --> 01:50.402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and thank you for that.

01:50.782 --> 01:51.303
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

01:51.323 --> 01:52.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm due by proxy, so.

01:53.345 --> 01:55.507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I give everyone Hanukkah cards.

01:55.607 --> 01:56.107
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

01:57.388 --> 02:02.633
[SPEAKER_08]: You, you, okay, DarkSakura converted to Judaism, you know, Loki married a Jew.

02:02.753 --> 02:04.575
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't, what's my connection?

02:04.635 --> 02:05.696
[SPEAKER_08]: I have friends that are Jewish.

02:06.436 --> 02:08.618
[SPEAKER_08]: The last girl I ever dated was Jewish.

02:09.739 --> 02:10.680
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.441
[SPEAKER_08]: I lived with John.

02:11.581 --> 02:13.603
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not really Jewish.

02:13.663 --> 02:14.343
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he's not.

02:14.383 --> 02:16.405
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's why I call him kinda Jew-y.

02:18.047 --> 02:18.307
[SPEAKER_11]: You know.

02:19.508 --> 02:21.069
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do mean it.

02:21.109 --> 02:23.171
[SPEAKER_08]: I like all sorts of people that I've met in my life.

02:23.191 --> 02:24.312
[SPEAKER_08]: And you like their food.

02:25.032 --> 02:29.596
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I've ever met a Jewish person I didn't really truly like, honestly.

02:30.797 --> 02:34.560
[SPEAKER_08]: Now everybody's going to be like, oh, that's a challenge.

02:34.801 --> 02:36.622
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me introduce you to the worst person I know.

02:36.682 --> 02:37.183
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

02:37.683 --> 02:39.985
[SPEAKER_11]: We're now about two weeks away from the alpacalypse.

02:41.003 --> 02:49.866
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, the whole Mayan calendar No, the alpacalypse, when the woolly, long-necked creatures of the world will come and trample us all Is that a Weird Al song?

02:50.166 --> 03:06.271
[SPEAKER_11]: No Oh, it should be I thought that was his album, was Alpacalypse Well yeah, but no, it was Alpacalypse But no, there's a thing where they're showing pictures of alpacas and they're saying so many days to the alpacalypse I've been laughing, so I want to have an alpaca party

03:07.631 --> 03:12.274
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, all I have to say is that how many times have they predicted the end of the world and it didn't happen?

03:12.394 --> 03:14.576
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just one more to put in there.

03:14.776 --> 03:15.156
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

03:16.137 --> 03:21.541
[SPEAKER_08]: When NASA has to come out and say, stop being depressed, the world is not going to end.

03:21.761 --> 03:23.142
[SPEAKER_02]: Your move next, world.

03:24.261 --> 03:29.309
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, how are you, Tech Master Loki, in non-Armageddon news?

03:29.649 --> 03:29.849
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

03:29.869 --> 03:35.998
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been constantly entering stuff on SteamGifts.com and obviously not winning anything.

03:36.179 --> 03:36.760
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what is this?

03:37.160 --> 03:39.504
[SPEAKER_06]: SteamGifts.com is basically a site you sign up for.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.646
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens is people give away Steam codes on there.

03:42.887 --> 03:43.827
[SPEAKER_06]: So you enter raffles.

03:44.188 --> 03:48.932
[SPEAKER_06]: And so every time that someone puts a code up there, you get 5% of the points that that code's worth.

03:48.972 --> 03:54.317
[SPEAKER_06]: So each dollar, say it's a $5 code, it's five points.

03:54.337 --> 03:55.758
[SPEAKER_06]: You would get one point in your account.

03:56.198 --> 04:05.381
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, I went in there earlier and I had 180-some, and so I kept, you know, enter to win, enter to win all these things, and then you come back a few days later, oh, I got more points!

04:05.661 --> 04:23.946
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you just keep entering stuff in there, and you can, you know, put your own stuff up there if you want, and then they'll give you contributing dollars in which you can go to certain ones they have locked out, okay, you have to have contributed $5 worth of Steam Codes to enter this drawing, and it's a little easier to win because it's going to be more exclusive.

04:24.366 --> 04:25.086
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just do that.

04:25.206 --> 04:28.008
[SPEAKER_06]: But since it's free, I figured why not?

04:28.228 --> 04:30.008
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might win something.

04:30.429 --> 04:31.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, in this case, not.

04:32.089 --> 04:34.150
[SPEAKER_08]: You might win spam email.

04:34.590 --> 04:35.291
[SPEAKER_08]: Fill in your box.

04:36.431 --> 04:50.177
[SPEAKER_08]: We always have the ever-present fourth guest on our show at the chatroom, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live, as we have for the past coming up on 11 years, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:50.217 --> 04:52.478
[SPEAKER_08]: That's vognetwork.com.

04:53.298 --> 04:59.060
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show each and every single Sunday night.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.601
[SPEAKER_08]: And Actdeft in our chatroom tonight says SteamGifts.com where nobody ever wins anything.

05:05.001 --> 05:05.841
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, somebody does.

05:05.901 --> 05:07.302
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it's very rare.

05:07.482 --> 05:09.362
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better chances in the lottery.

05:09.502 --> 05:13.404
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft does follow that up with I only won one game in like a thousand entries.

05:13.484 --> 05:15.424
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was one game.

05:15.684 --> 05:16.944
[SPEAKER_06]: Still better odds in the lottery.

05:17.104 --> 05:18.885
[SPEAKER_08]: It's better than Loki's done out of that apparently.

05:19.913 --> 05:23.577
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I want to promote something.

05:23.697 --> 05:23.917
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

05:23.957 --> 05:24.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

05:24.377 --> 05:25.438
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you about it earlier.

05:25.839 --> 05:26.379
[SPEAKER_10]: My new Tumblr.

05:28.221 --> 05:28.501
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

05:28.521 --> 05:29.162
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not the Tumbles?

05:29.182 --> 05:32.004
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because I want people to give me suggestions.

05:32.425 --> 05:42.114
[SPEAKER_11]: My Tumblr is masseffecting.tumblr.com and I'm doing this series called Lol Effect where I'm doing just all captions on Mass Effect screencaps and I want people to participate.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.557
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think of a good one, make it and send it to me and I will post it.

05:45.737 --> 05:49.839
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think maybe everybody's burned out on that by now because you talk about it every week?

05:49.859 --> 05:57.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what I'm getting on Twitter right now is I need to shut up about the series because I'm ruining it by talking about it so much.

05:57.282 --> 05:57.482
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

05:57.762 --> 05:58.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

05:58.202 --> 05:58.402
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

05:58.963 --> 05:59.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Dearest.

06:02.261 --> 06:20.829
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, again, live.vognetwork.com Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth What I wanted to talk about tonight was the VGAs, which of course happened on Friday night And I don't think any of us watched, well that's not true, Jamie, you saw bits and pieces of it it sounds like

06:21.189 --> 06:22.309
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was... Okay.

06:22.790 --> 06:24.890
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw this gift set go... I wasn't going to watch it all.

06:24.910 --> 06:33.113
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I saw this gift set go up on my Tumblr feed that was all like BroShep and FemShep playing multiplayer with Garrus.

06:33.973 --> 06:35.094
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, okay, that's funny.

06:35.274 --> 06:38.275
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I found that the whole VGAs were streamed.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.816
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went looking through the stream to try to find it.

06:40.836 --> 06:42.456
[SPEAKER_11]: And I ended up watching bits and pieces of it.

06:42.496 --> 06:44.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the Halo 4 thing was pretty funny.

06:45.057 --> 06:48.578
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I found the Mass Effect thing and I stopped caring about everything else.

06:48.698 --> 06:49.979
[SPEAKER_11]: I did watch the Claptrap one.

06:50.279 --> 06:50.979
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty funny.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.222
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the little blips for best character of the year.

06:56.803 --> 06:59.264
[SPEAKER_11]: The Claptrap one was funny, I must admit, but no.

07:01.165 --> 07:02.246
[SPEAKER_11]: Shepard was robbed, both of them.

07:03.166 --> 07:11.191
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to try to talk about or evaluate a show I didn't watch, but just listening to Bobby, because he is before us every Sunday night at VOG Network.

07:11.591 --> 07:12.252
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

07:31.634 --> 07:33.915
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying anything bad about the game.

07:34.015 --> 07:36.117
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played it, so I know no good or bad.

07:36.177 --> 07:45.422
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know a lot of people really love it, and it has nothing to do with the OMG Zombies part of it, but just I guess the storytelling in the game is so good.

07:45.962 --> 07:56.507
[SPEAKER_08]: And you had another game that was kind of similar in some ways, Journey, which is one of those kind of very difficult to explain to somebody why it's so good, but it's that whole emotional connection.

07:56.587 --> 07:57.008
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like...

07:57.928 --> 08:01.610
[SPEAKER_08]: and Journey probably won, what, the second most awards besides Walking Dead.

08:01.970 --> 08:05.072
[SPEAKER_08]: So emotion really seemed to connect with the audience this year.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.354
[SPEAKER_08]: The big bro games, like, what would be the bro games?

08:08.414 --> 08:13.156
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo 4, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, to some extent even Mass Effect, Jamie.

08:13.616 --> 08:16.278
[SPEAKER_08]: None of those games really got the same type of recognition this year.

08:16.838 --> 08:17.978
[SPEAKER_10]: Best RPG, hello!

08:41.425 --> 08:47.770
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the choice of the awards this year and the way it's all presented mean that they're taking this more seriously?

08:48.811 --> 08:49.272
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts?

08:50.793 --> 08:50.973
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

08:51.353 --> 08:52.714
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm yelling at Dan in chat room.

08:53.255 --> 08:54.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan is in chat.

08:54.176 --> 08:54.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dear.

08:54.596 --> 08:57.839
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that they need to have Samuel L. Jackson hosted each year because he's pretty funny.

08:58.039 --> 08:58.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they've been doing that.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.622
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's only hosted four times out of ten years, so...

09:04.082 --> 09:05.683
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:24.867 --> 09:25.788
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it looked familiar.

09:25.848 --> 09:26.768
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, somebody from Walking Dead.

09:27.048 --> 09:27.329
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

09:27.449 --> 09:34.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, again, I can't evaluate a game I have not played, so I have nothing good nor bad, but I hear a lot of good things.

09:34.653 --> 09:36.194
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will play it before the end of the year.

09:36.214 --> 09:37.996
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Muir wasn't nominated, was he?

09:38.016 --> 09:38.776
[SPEAKER_08]: He wasn't even nominated, no.

09:38.816 --> 09:40.357
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because he wasn't all that great.

09:40.797 --> 09:41.018
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

09:43.520 --> 09:43.720
[SPEAKER_08]: He's fine.

09:43.740 --> 09:44.201
[SPEAKER_08]: He's fine.

09:59.014 --> 10:02.796
[SPEAKER_11]: and her Carol Danvers makes me a little, you know, warm.

10:03.256 --> 10:03.656
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

10:04.036 --> 10:04.416
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

10:04.776 --> 10:06.597
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatter's filling in the gap there.

10:06.697 --> 10:09.879
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Clementine from The Walking Dead, Melissa Hutchinson.

10:10.539 --> 10:11.499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she's not bad.

10:11.719 --> 10:20.383
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even, again, I haven't played the game, but I recognize that name as one that people talk a lot about on Twitter, so I can clearly see that, okay, you know.

10:21.823 --> 10:23.343
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:49.171 --> 10:56.133
[SPEAKER_08]: And just so you know, the best human male voice was Damian Clark from Borderlands 2 or Handsome Jack.

10:56.553 --> 10:57.233
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's awesome.

10:57.253 --> 10:59.313
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the little bits and pieces I've heard.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.114
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

11:00.654 --> 11:03.614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

11:03.674 --> 11:06.895
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't the male award seem to go to villains more often than heroes?

11:09.256 --> 11:15.137
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't, oh my God, Mark Hamill, thank you, win the award for the Joker last year?

11:15.157 --> 11:15.297
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.758
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Campbell's awesome.

11:17.798 --> 11:20.400
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also the last time he's voicing the Joker.

11:21.361 --> 11:22.382
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you give him more money.

11:22.462 --> 11:22.842
[SPEAKER_11]: I doubt it.

11:25.084 --> 11:32.008
[SPEAKER_11]: You think about people having to do a voice like that that's so different from their regular voice, it's going to actually take a physical toll on someone.

11:32.168 --> 11:40.534
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have to do another Arkham game at some point, though, so it'll be interesting to see how they frame it.

11:41.715 --> 11:44.317
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else on the VGAs anyone wishes to comment on?

11:46.249 --> 11:47.150
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to watch that clip.

11:47.210 --> 11:47.870
[SPEAKER_11]: It was hilarious.

11:48.010 --> 11:49.011
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take a look at some point.

11:49.051 --> 11:49.771
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Lance, too.

11:50.032 --> 11:54.915
[SPEAKER_11]: And if anybody wants to see it, it's on my Tumblr, MassAffecting.Tumblr.com Plug, plug, cheap plug.

11:54.935 --> 11:58.197
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, the reason is because Viacom blocked it on YouTube.

11:59.838 --> 12:01.679
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunstar in our chat room, who could that be?

12:01.699 --> 12:03.020
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Dan.

12:03.140 --> 12:09.624
[SPEAKER_08]: No doubt commenting on the awards I was just talking about says, Evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.086
[SPEAKER_08]: Well put.

12:13.337 --> 12:17.461
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, my hubby is awesome because he said Garrus does sound like a boss, though.

12:19.162 --> 12:25.928
[SPEAKER_11]: His voice actor is kind of a goofy-looking guy, and if you ever watched the episode of Buffy he was in, his awesome voice does not suit his face.

12:26.328 --> 12:33.675
[SPEAKER_08]: It is kind of nice when your significant other will make a concession towards your fandom, isn't it?

12:34.035 --> 12:36.597
[SPEAKER_08]: Has Nellie ever made any concessions towards your fandoms, Loki?

12:36.657 --> 12:38.619
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we had a discussion today about, like...

12:40.060 --> 12:43.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, so what exactly, you know, what do you think?

12:43.162 --> 12:44.343
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, garbage.

12:44.543 --> 12:47.946
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, my point exactly.

12:48.907 --> 12:52.729
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in the case of Alan and I, we really do like a lot of the same stuff.

12:52.790 --> 12:58.834
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he's way more into Half-Life than I am, but I don't, like, dislike it at all.

12:58.974 --> 13:02.457
[SPEAKER_08]: When I played it, it was, you know, the little bits I have played, I've enjoyed.

13:02.897 --> 13:06.280
[SPEAKER_08]: I just haven't sat down and played the whole thing, so we don't really have...

13:07.040 --> 13:08.081
[SPEAKER_08]: That same conflict.

13:08.101 --> 13:09.181
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's something.

13:09.241 --> 13:10.442
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something I'm not thinking of.

13:12.202 --> 13:12.563
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

13:12.583 --> 13:17.685
[SPEAKER_08]: My Rocky Horror thing and my cult movie thing, he's been a good sport about coming out to see those and support that.

13:18.345 --> 13:21.287
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always nice when you're seeing if another will buy into fandoms and so forth.

13:22.507 --> 13:28.234
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I guess let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.

13:29.175 --> 13:35.522
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragenator in chat says, what are the odds of Mass Effect and Garrus winning every award if DarkSakura hosted an award show?

13:35.682 --> 13:36.563
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up, don't judge me.

13:36.643 --> 13:37.905
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why we don't host one.

13:38.145 --> 13:38.766
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't judge me.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.048
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:02.597 --> 14:04.140
[SPEAKER_11]: and Fairy Solitaire.

14:05.161 --> 14:06.263
[SPEAKER_08]: God, that game is awful.

14:06.423 --> 14:07.205
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

14:07.485 --> 14:10.430
[SPEAKER_08]: For the past three weeks in a row, you've talked about your Fairy Solitaire.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.974
[SPEAKER_08]: You keep saying it's awful, but it's clearly not.

14:13.590 --> 14:14.911
[SPEAKER_11]: It's stupidly addicting.

14:14.991 --> 14:18.374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like playing on... Remember back in the day when Neopets was big?

14:20.856 --> 14:21.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that was awful.

14:22.498 --> 14:24.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you remember the stupid card games on Neopets?

14:25.100 --> 14:25.360
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.042
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were kind of addicting?

14:27.402 --> 14:28.303
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Neopets still around?

14:28.323 --> 14:29.244
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to be still around.

14:29.444 --> 14:29.904
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll check.

14:29.964 --> 14:31.185
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if I still have my damn account.

14:31.205 --> 14:34.008
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they sell Neopets shit at Claire's for some time?

14:34.048 --> 14:34.688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they did.

14:34.968 --> 14:35.389
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

14:35.409 --> 14:37.851
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever walk into a Claire's just to buy Neopets stuff?

14:37.911 --> 14:38.512
[SPEAKER_08]: Be honest.

14:38.832 --> 14:40.073
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone that we both know has.

14:40.093 --> 14:40.994
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

14:43.396 --> 14:44.417
[SPEAKER_11]: who hosts another show.

14:44.777 --> 14:45.617
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, okay.

14:45.798 --> 14:46.398
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

14:46.558 --> 14:47.759
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a witness to this.

14:47.779 --> 14:48.259
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

14:49.040 --> 14:49.760
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't judge.

14:50.020 --> 14:50.481
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't judge.

14:50.501 --> 14:50.981
[SPEAKER_11]: I can judge.

14:51.321 --> 14:54.203
[SPEAKER_08]: People have bought World of Warcraft cards.

14:54.924 --> 14:55.404
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't judge.

14:55.424 --> 14:57.225
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone bought a Mass Effect 2 deck of cards.

14:58.186 --> 14:59.607
[SPEAKER_11]: And, wow.

14:59.887 --> 15:00.107
[SPEAKER_08]: You?

15:00.147 --> 15:00.367
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.169
[SPEAKER_11]: And, wow, lo and behold, the Joker card was Joker.

15:03.249 --> 15:04.630
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody has their thing.

15:07.134 --> 15:12.099
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I have not turned into a My Little Pony fan because there is nothing that is awesome as the old one.

15:12.659 --> 15:14.001
[SPEAKER_11]: The old one kicked ass.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.362
[SPEAKER_11]: The new one is stupid.

15:17.344 --> 15:18.705
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm judging you all.

15:18.805 --> 15:21.948
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for your week besides Mass Effect and Very Solitaire?

15:22.549 --> 15:30.957
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched Dan play Sega Racing Classic and he put it in karaoke mode and started singing Let's Fry Sky High.

15:33.294 --> 15:34.155
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's Cousin's Daughter

15:53.534 --> 16:11.464
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I wasn't there I was hanging with Becky that night I assumed you were, my bad I was out on a booze buying spree Lots of Bailey's and Hypnotic and Kahlua and Sake And then Becky dyed my hair and then we made fun of people

16:11.784 --> 16:12.965
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:33.510 --> 16:34.210
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't listen to her.

16:34.331 --> 16:34.791
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

16:37.052 --> 16:37.332
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

16:38.273 --> 16:38.673
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

16:39.033 --> 16:39.334
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl.

16:40.394 --> 16:41.475
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about a different game.

16:42.676 --> 16:44.777
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Far Cry 3 this week.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.638
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, a little bit more in the campaign.

16:47.478 --> 16:49.039
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's fantastic.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.780
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hunting dingoes last night.

16:51.081 --> 16:53.202
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be no baby eating in my launch.

16:54.503 --> 16:55.763
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.

16:55.803 --> 16:56.524
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I do?

16:56.544 --> 16:56.584
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

17:00.276 --> 17:01.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

17:14.858 --> 17:15.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

17:38.462 --> 17:38.923
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

17:59.386 --> 18:04.452
[SPEAKER_06]: The number of players plus one times 40 for Psycho.

18:04.492 --> 18:07.995
[SPEAKER_06]: So this thing had like 16,000 hearts of health.

18:08.436 --> 18:11.259
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were literally beating it with a stick for...

18:13.041 --> 18:15.242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say 20 minutes and it still wasn't dead.

18:15.642 --> 18:19.083
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like, okay, I think this is a little too powerful.

18:19.704 --> 18:20.784
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to tweak all that stuff.

18:20.944 --> 18:22.485
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a bunch of cool classes in there.

18:23.245 --> 18:25.926
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend wanted me to make a pimp class, so I made a pimp class.

18:25.946 --> 18:28.667
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a pimp stick that you can beat things with.

18:29.727 --> 18:33.789
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your variety of hoes that you can use that have different abilities.

18:34.629 --> 18:36.291
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because the game has hoes in it.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.714
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else?

18:39.774 --> 18:42.937
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Wolfmaster that you have wolves that attack things.

18:43.157 --> 18:46.100
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a miner class.

18:46.781 --> 18:52.606
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a class that's like a golem class that you can build iron golems with.

18:52.686 --> 18:53.047
[SPEAKER_06]: Although...

18:53.787 --> 18:58.549
[SPEAKER_06]: No wait, I had that class, but then the Iron Golems did no damage to anything, so I had to remove that.

18:59.649 --> 19:03.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninjas, you know, lots of fun stuff, but it gets hard.

19:03.691 --> 19:08.753
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, it's insanely hard, but it's kind of fun.

19:08.913 --> 19:13.635
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm still balancing that stuff, probably working on that a little bit this week, but some good times so far.

19:14.635 --> 19:19.616
[SPEAKER_08]: And hit stun in chat at live.vognetwork.com wants to know, are we getting world edit back?

19:20.677 --> 19:23.197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sorry, I've been messing with the permission stuff.

19:23.257 --> 19:27.698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you will have world edit back soon, as soon as I fix that.

19:29.559 --> 19:34.380
[SPEAKER_06]: I took everything out to figure out why the mob arena wasn't working, and...

19:35.140 --> 19:45.711
[SPEAKER_06]: in the process I kind of removed some of the permissions I may put it back to the permissions bucket the way I had it before because B permissions is kind of weird so I'll fix that again

19:48.061 --> 20:14.544
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Call of Duty just Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2 a little bit of each mostly Modern Warfare 3 because we were supposed to be getting copies to do LAN stuff with but those never came from Activision and at this point I don't think they are coming so I'm not buying copies for everybody so fuck that so we'll just I'll play with my friend and I think that's all I've played this week

20:15.705 --> 20:40.821
[SPEAKER_08]: um wait no there's there's one other thing what the hell did I play this week there's one other game I played yeah it's probably not important uh my gaming week as I've talked about before on the show I did pre-order the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation and uh it came whatever you'd buy it too if you actually no since with the reasons that I'll let you finish

20:41.300 --> 20:42.221
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the thing.

20:43.061 --> 20:49.045
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the game, and it's fine, but it was a little... I'm doing my playthrough again.

20:49.186 --> 20:51.407
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't done a complete playthrough of the Mass Effect series.

20:51.547 --> 20:54.970
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've talked about the game a lot, and it's because I really enjoy the multiplayer.

20:54.990 --> 20:56.170
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of what's been keeping me afloat.

20:56.671 --> 20:59.473
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first time I've really sat down to replay the entire series.

20:59.693 --> 21:00.774
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm doing it this time.

21:00.834 --> 21:06.518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Renegade's first time I did it at Paragon, and already I'm just seeing such differences in the story.

21:07.078 --> 21:07.238
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

21:08.719 --> 21:09.700
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing through the first game.

21:09.741 --> 21:10.842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing it on PlayStation.

21:11.102 --> 21:16.007
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you guys didn't know, this is the first time the original Mass Effect has been on the PlayStation 3.

21:16.107 --> 21:19.231
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first time.

21:19.511 --> 21:19.771
[SPEAKER_08]: And what?

21:19.791 --> 21:20.912
[SPEAKER_08]: The game's five years old.

21:21.233 --> 21:24.576
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Microsoft had an exclusive on it for however many years.

21:24.596 --> 21:25.858
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're just now bringing it out.

21:26.478 --> 21:28.540
[SPEAKER_08]: So with all this time to...

21:29.281 --> 21:34.263
[SPEAKER_08]: Release it and get it right, you'd think it would be bug-free, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.

21:34.363 --> 21:37.845
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been running into quite a few bugs that are not fun.

21:38.585 --> 21:50.371
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're not game-breaking, so I can't complain too much, but characters facing the wrong way in dialogue scenes, just weird.

21:50.431 --> 21:54.092
[SPEAKER_08]: Complete parts skipping, but when I load my game, it plays fine.

21:54.112 --> 21:55.213
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're facing the wrong direction?

21:55.233 --> 21:55.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

21:56.013 --> 21:57.594
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to ask you a question!

21:57.654 --> 21:57.834
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

21:58.594 --> 22:13.079
[SPEAKER_11]: I only had one thing ever like that happen on the PC version for Mass Effect 3 and that's when you're talking to Liara and Glyph is in the room and if Shepard looks at Glyph then she doesn't look back at Liara at all but that's only for that one conversation

22:13.482 --> 22:14.343
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

22:28.642 --> 22:31.403
[SPEAKER_08]: So, which by the way, I didn't get to that demo yet.

22:32.524 --> 22:34.044
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, don't ask me because I haven't played it yet.

22:35.725 --> 22:37.766
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I played a little bit of that.

22:37.826 --> 22:42.028
[SPEAKER_08]: And besides the bugs, you know, the game itself is still great.

22:42.128 --> 22:49.351
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would still say the best version is either going to be 360 or PC, depending on if you're a console or PC.

22:49.471 --> 22:49.791
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually...

22:50.071 --> 22:52.432
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first game, the PC is the superior version.

22:52.452 --> 22:52.972
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

22:53.252 --> 22:59.074
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they made, like, the hacking thing is much better and, you know, just the Mako stuff is not as frustrating.

22:59.114 --> 23:03.615
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the first game, all the Medigel, not the Medigel, the Omnigel all the time.

23:03.635 --> 23:04.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

23:04.155 --> 23:05.016
[SPEAKER_11]: Or whatever that stuff was.

23:05.296 --> 23:05.416
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

23:06.777 --> 23:08.118
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, other games I've been playing.

23:08.298 --> 23:12.221
[SPEAKER_08]: I got from my rental service Silent Hill Book of Memories on the PSP.

23:12.822 --> 23:14.383
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was checking that out a little bit.

23:14.523 --> 23:20.068
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really gotten much further than the original demo, so I can't really say anything in addition to the demo I've already played.

23:20.748 --> 23:20.908
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

23:23.973 --> 23:27.234
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hate it, but it isn't really Silent Hill either.

23:27.714 --> 23:30.376
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody slapped Silent Hill on a dungeon crawler game.

23:30.636 --> 23:31.356
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

23:31.876 --> 23:33.517
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, yeah.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.077
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that was the thing.

23:34.117 --> 23:35.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, maybe I'll try this and stuff.

23:35.898 --> 23:39.040
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I looked at the back of the box and it had the screenshots.

23:39.060 --> 23:41.441
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what is a top-down third-person game?

23:41.621 --> 23:41.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

23:44.165 --> 23:45.226
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Alan's comment.

23:45.266 --> 23:48.207
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass Effect 3 still has the exorcism neck bug, which is hilarious.

23:48.267 --> 23:49.108
[SPEAKER_11]: Trainer gets it a lot.

23:49.448 --> 23:51.449
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's like they're looking completely over their shoulder.

23:51.509 --> 23:52.570
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it the most with Javik.

23:53.835 --> 24:00.039
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me put it this way, when I played the series on 360, I don't remember ever seeing a bug until the Omega DLC.

24:00.839 --> 24:06.402
[SPEAKER_08]: The Omega DLC was the first time I saw bugs in the 360 version, so just put it out there.

24:06.882 --> 24:13.726
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, by the way, just in case you're curious, the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 1 is based off the 360 version, not the PC version.

24:14.106 --> 24:17.208
[SPEAKER_08]: The hacking game is the whole button-pushing thing, not the...

24:19.129 --> 24:47.874
[SPEAKER_08]: um uh arrow through the circular lock thing that the PC has so interesting but anyway we've talked enough about that game here on this program so I'm just putting it out there that I do have the trilogy on PlayStation and it's just called being a fan and buying all the things you know what what the problem is okay you know I started off playing it on 360 and it hurt my hand

24:49.508 --> 24:56.265
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna go get another version of a game I've already got on PC when I love my PC version and I can make my Shepard blue.

24:57.107 --> 24:57.468
[SPEAKER_11]: Just sayin'.

24:58.416 --> 25:04.839
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just... I was curious about, you know, some of the differences and especially multiplayer on three I wanted to have on the PlayStation.

25:04.859 --> 25:05.959
[SPEAKER_08]: Research for the show, Rob.

25:05.999 --> 25:07.200
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, research for the show.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.481
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not like I'm going to get a free copy, so might as well.

25:10.201 --> 25:10.822
[SPEAKER_08]: Might as well.

25:11.802 --> 25:12.062
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

25:12.702 --> 25:13.803
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for our gaming week.

25:13.823 --> 25:16.324
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll get into gaming news after I mention housekeeping.

25:16.704 --> 25:19.185
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR and, of course, our Facebook.

25:19.585 --> 25:23.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

25:24.027 --> 25:27.209
[SPEAKER_08]: And DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, don't judge me as she's grabbing another locket.

25:27.629 --> 25:29.271
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to make another pack during break.

25:29.391 --> 25:30.111
[SPEAKER_08]: I grabbed one earlier.

25:30.132 --> 25:31.933
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so good, but they're not good for you.

25:31.973 --> 25:32.914
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we keep eating them?

25:33.214 --> 25:34.155
[SPEAKER_10]: Potatoes are potassium.

25:34.175 --> 25:37.659
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Alan's going to get home and be like, you spoiled dinner.

25:37.939 --> 25:41.062
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to make him a whole big thing of them, okay?

25:41.462 --> 25:41.782
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

25:42.863 --> 25:44.605
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some gaming news.

25:45.045 --> 25:45.346
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

25:45.846 --> 25:50.030
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so there is another game that's receiving a nomination for Grammy.

25:50.671 --> 25:52.492
[SPEAKER_06]: That wonderful game would be Journey.

25:52.833 --> 26:00.119
[SPEAKER_06]: And the soundtrack of the game is, I guess, nominated for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.

26:00.459 --> 26:00.900
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess...

26:06.144 --> 26:14.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Journey, The Adventures of Tintin, The Artist, Dark Knight Rises, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.

26:14.849 --> 26:16.190
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty cool if it won.

26:17.110 --> 26:18.811
[SPEAKER_06]: The soundtrack in the game was pretty awesome.

26:21.053 --> 26:26.896
[SPEAKER_06]: And you may remember, of course, Civ IV won that award, I guess, was that last year?

26:27.833 --> 26:31.638
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists

26:43.152 --> 26:43.873
[SPEAKER_08]: Siv-4 came out in what, 08?

26:43.973 --> 26:44.113
[SPEAKER_08]: But

27:02.330 --> 27:02.970
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

27:23.459 --> 27:46.765
[SPEAKER_08]: so um and I'm not not belittling that achievement by any means that's an amazing thing the amazing piece of work by Christopher Tinn and so happy that he got acknowledged for that um but this is interesting because now this is you know music that was made for the game released on the game soundtrack an entire body of work dedicated to the game getting nominated for the Grammy and certainly that's

27:48.261 --> 27:54.802
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like we dipped our toe in with Baba Yetu, and now we're starting to put the whole foot in by nominating a game soundtrack.

27:54.883 --> 27:58.683
[SPEAKER_08]: And in reality, this is almost as good as it gets.

27:59.483 --> 28:12.366
[SPEAKER_08]: Video game soundtrack songs are not going to really get nominated for Song of the Year unless you have something on the caliber of the Titanic song was the last soundtrack song I can think of that got nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy.

28:12.866 --> 28:15.467
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're long, long away from that.

28:16.107 --> 28:22.630
[SPEAKER_08]: but being up there with all those films that's an awesome achievement so now the question is he going to win?

28:24.391 --> 28:45.162
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know I know it's hard to say we're not really in the music industry so certainly it's got to be getting him a little more exposure though than the competition but at the same time the artist won the Grammy didn't it or the artist excuse me the artist won the Oscar didn't it so it's you know

28:48.611 --> 28:53.698
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that really ties in just because it won the Oscar doesn't mean I'm going to win for music.

28:53.718 --> 28:54.259
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.

28:54.459 --> 28:55.360
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know what will happen.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.703
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a different body of voters and you never know.

28:57.723 --> 29:03.711
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some people like us that kind of look at it and go, yeah, video games should be getting more recognition.

29:04.179 --> 29:06.581
[SPEAKER_08]: Or there'll be people that react quite the opposite.

29:06.741 --> 29:08.902
[SPEAKER_08]: It just really depends on who's voting on those.

29:11.464 --> 29:15.447
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, It won't win.

29:15.827 --> 29:16.848
[SPEAKER_08]: It's flat out, it won't win.

29:17.168 --> 29:18.169
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is what we wanted.

29:19.570 --> 29:21.771
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if not winning is what we wanted.

29:21.811 --> 29:24.353
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, I don't think that's what he's trying to say.

29:24.393 --> 29:28.716
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's trying to say the acknowledgement next to the film scores is what we wanted.

29:28.776 --> 29:30.958
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, I think to some extent that is what we want.

29:32.759 --> 29:36.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Could they possibly have a separate category for game soundtracks someday?

29:36.542 --> 29:40.085
[SPEAKER_06]: Could they be getting confused with Journey the Game and Journey the Band?

29:41.106 --> 29:42.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I love Journey.

29:42.087 --> 29:44.469
[SPEAKER_06]: They should totally get nominated for Best Soundtrack Score.

29:45.890 --> 29:46.911
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

29:46.971 --> 29:49.593
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think Journey's been nominated for a Grammy since 82.

29:50.514 --> 29:54.517
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they need to score the next Tron movie.

29:56.218 --> 29:56.558
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

29:57.079 --> 29:58.680
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more news.

29:59.081 --> 30:00.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't stop light speeding.

30:01.533 --> 30:07.076
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's about a comment from Gabe Newell on living room PCs, which I want to preface this story.

30:07.196 --> 30:14.060
[SPEAKER_08]: You were showing me before the show, Loki, this big screen mode in Steam, which I got to be honest, I haven't played a lot with, but you were showing it to me.

30:14.140 --> 30:25.906
[SPEAKER_08]: And in a nutshell, it does turn your Steam environment into a Xbox style UI that takes up your full monitor space.

30:26.006 --> 30:26.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

30:26.506 --> 30:27.967
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't look like Windows anymore.

30:27.987 --> 30:28.928
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks nice, I think.

30:28.988 --> 30:29.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

30:30.228 --> 30:43.433
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the ability that it basically, since it is catered towards using a joystick, which is fine, that you can sort your games based on joystick support, whether the games have it or not, which is kind of cool.

30:43.753 --> 30:47.675
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing I wish they would add, and maybe this is something that they can add later on, is like...

30:48.155 --> 31:04.520
[SPEAKER_06]: Those games that do not support joysticks, maybe have it where you can have some sort of in-Steam client app or something like that where you can set up almost like an expatter type thing where you can assign keys to the joystick buttons, and then that way you can have a profile for each thing.

31:04.540 --> 31:13.663
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of these games, and actually it's funny because Arma 2 is one that supports the joystick, and I thought that was one that didn't support the Xbox gamepad.

31:13.683 --> 31:16.164
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, huh, that already does, so sweet.

31:16.184 --> 31:16.624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

31:17.184 --> 31:22.427
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not like a wireless keyboard to use as a controller for a game console is unheard of.

31:22.627 --> 31:24.548
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Final Fantasy XI?

31:24.588 --> 31:38.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but see, the thing is, as I was looking at it, I'm like, you know, that would not be that... It wouldn't be that weird to actually... You know, this whole... Everyone's kind of talking about doom and gloom with the next console cycle and stuff.

31:38.176 --> 31:45.040
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that it's ever going to happen, but if it went the way where, oh, we're going to lock all this stuff down, you're not going to be able to sell used games and stuff like that.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Would playing on PC be that bad?

31:47.642 --> 31:49.224
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think it would be that bad, actually.

31:49.264 --> 31:52.688
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's all going through Steam, it seems very convenient for me.

31:53.129 --> 31:56.953
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, the vast majority of the games I have on Steam I have not played yet.

31:57.774 --> 32:01.459
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just that keeps adding to the list.

32:01.599 --> 32:02.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep getting things for it.

32:02.620 --> 32:05.503
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have quite a collection that it would be kind of cool to have.

32:06.124 --> 32:29.261
[SPEAKER_08]: A gaming PC hooked up to my TV to play stuff like that Well, that is where Gabe Newell thinks things are going Meaning that those types of living room PCs are going to be big competition for the next-gen gaming cycle This is in an interview with Kotaku at the VGAs Because, you know, Gary Newell was there Was that what she called him?

32:29.301 --> 32:29.882
[SPEAKER_08]: Gary Newell?

32:30.262 --> 32:30.862
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

32:31.383 --> 32:31.923
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of messed up.

32:31.943 --> 32:34.045
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a clip somewhere.

32:34.125 --> 32:36.706
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the interviewees called him the wrong name.

32:37.727 --> 32:39.648
[SPEAKER_08]: You're Gabe from Penny Arcade, right?

32:40.529 --> 32:41.370
[SPEAKER_08]: Gabe Duell.

32:42.050 --> 32:43.011
[SPEAKER_08]: She apologized for it.

32:43.031 --> 32:43.871
[SPEAKER_02]: Cousin of Dudley D. Wright.

32:43.951 --> 32:45.172
[SPEAKER_08]: She apologized for it on Twitter.

32:45.272 --> 32:52.817
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got to say, you know, live TV sucks sometimes, especially, you know, it can be a lot of pressure.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.059
[SPEAKER_08]: So I shouldn't give her too hard of a time, but...

32:55.639 --> 32:58.600
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, she's going to get yelled at for that mistake.

32:58.660 --> 33:09.864
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, Gabe Newell doing his thing on the red carpet of VGAs, talking to Kotaku, talking about that the big picture interface ended up being stronger than expected.

33:10.664 --> 33:13.005
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, they want Steam Linux out of beta.

33:13.365 --> 33:16.106
[SPEAKER_08]: They want big picture on that operating system.

33:16.466 --> 33:19.788
[SPEAKER_08]: This gives Valve flexibility in developing their own hardware.

33:20.068 --> 33:20.568
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

33:22.168 --> 33:22.909
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at OUYA

33:36.980 --> 33:41.002
[SPEAKER_08]: OUYA is a bare-ass bones type of living room PC.

33:41.383 --> 33:44.765
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's that same setup as you would see with big picture mode.

33:44.865 --> 33:47.006
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, the interface looks kind of similar.

33:47.186 --> 33:48.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I do like big picture a little bit.

33:48.927 --> 33:49.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, from what I've seen.

33:50.048 --> 33:51.568
[SPEAKER_06]: We obviously don't know what the OUYA looks like.

33:51.949 --> 33:53.790
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, we're not that far away.

33:54.110 --> 33:58.632
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and that OUYA thing, man, is smaller than this box right here.

33:58.813 --> 34:00.313
[SPEAKER_06]: My four pack of Red Bulls.

34:02.494 --> 34:16.840
[SPEAKER_08]: Gabe Newell said in the interview, quote, I think in general that most customers and most developers are going to find that the PC is a better environment for them because they won't have to split the world into thinking about why are my friends in the living room?

34:17.080 --> 34:19.821
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are my video sources in the living room different from everyone else?

34:20.321 --> 34:23.782
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a sense, we hopefully are going to unify those environments.

34:24.743 --> 34:24.963
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

34:27.504 --> 34:27.904
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

34:28.124 --> 34:28.144
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

34:30.182 --> 34:32.022
[SPEAKER_08]: The unification thing is interesting.

34:33.083 --> 34:37.664
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in a way that's what the consoles kind of want to be that all-in-one device.

34:37.784 --> 34:44.546
[SPEAKER_08]: And you do see that like 360 tries to talk to Windows Media and all that sharing.

34:44.606 --> 34:48.287
[SPEAKER_08]: And even the PlayStation 3, you can kind of stream things off your PC and so forth.

34:48.727 --> 34:52.928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not exactly intuitive on either one how to do it.

34:53.348 --> 34:58.351
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if a lot of that was built a little more into the interfaces, you'd see a lot more of that.

34:58.391 --> 35:02.974
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they make it too many clicks to get to a lot of that stuff within the consoles.

35:03.794 --> 35:04.695
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's interesting.

35:05.415 --> 35:10.799
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it definitely lends something to the fact of if they sold a little gaming PC in a box,

35:11.559 --> 35:18.243
[SPEAKER_08]: that looked like a console, hooked up to your TV like a console, ran like a console, why would I need a console?

35:18.924 --> 35:29.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Price point, because I think console prices, it's going to be hard to build a gaming PC for $400 that can run all of these games and look nice.

35:30.311 --> 35:37.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, you can build a $400 gaming PC, but it's not going to run a lot of these games in higher ultra and stuff.

35:37.716 --> 35:45.641
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're streaming to your TV via HDMI, you're talking a really large resolution, 1080p.

35:46.182 --> 35:52.406
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be a little hard to make them look that nice and run on that big of a resolution.

35:53.647 --> 35:54.507
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing.

35:54.807 --> 35:59.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, a lot of the games get stripped down a bit.

36:01.172 --> 36:01.652
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.

36:01.692 --> 36:06.776
[SPEAKER_06]: With PCs, and like, hell, I spent $1,700 on my PC a few years ago.

36:07.176 --> 36:08.597
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just like this high-end thing.

36:08.617 --> 36:10.179
[SPEAKER_06]: It ran Crysis, pretty awesome.

36:10.899 --> 36:12.680
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now it's just, it's junk.

36:12.961 --> 36:17.144
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, I can't even upgrade it without replacing everything.

36:17.964 --> 36:20.086
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's nothing I can salvage from it.

36:20.346 --> 36:21.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the case.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the heatsinks, but...

36:23.088 --> 36:25.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else is just, it's so old.

36:25.750 --> 36:36.559
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I find the part where he talks about how Linux, the Steam on Linux has to get better so that they can kind of develop a box that supports Linux and so forth.

36:37.179 --> 36:41.783
[SPEAKER_08]: That strikes me as interesting because why do video game consoles usually work the way they do?

36:42.163 --> 36:44.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're dedicated gaming consoles.

36:44.505 --> 36:48.568
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have all this excess fat for all the other things that a PC does.

36:48.588 --> 36:48.968
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

36:49.128 --> 36:58.811
[SPEAKER_08]: But the interesting thing about Linux is that, as I understand it, part of the reason people are such fans of Linux is that it's a lean operating system and it doesn't have all the fat that Windows has with it.

36:58.831 --> 37:00.372
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm running on my netbook.

37:01.692 --> 37:03.473
[SPEAKER_08]: Would that be a fair statement about Linux?

37:03.493 --> 37:04.493
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say so.

37:04.533 --> 37:07.534
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got the control that Windows lacks.

37:08.095 --> 37:13.657
[SPEAKER_08]: So they want to use a better operating system, essentially, to do a dedicated thing.

37:14.177 --> 37:16.177
[SPEAKER_08]: Which makes sense.

37:18.198 --> 37:21.419
[SPEAKER_08]: But could it be as powerful as a dedicated gaming console?

37:21.599 --> 37:21.879
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

37:21.899 --> 37:22.719
[SPEAKER_08]: You make a good point.

37:23.019 --> 37:27.220
[SPEAKER_08]: You expect that a little set-top box is going to do this 1080p, and it probably won't.

37:27.320 --> 37:42.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, a lot of the games on Steam, aside from the big console AAA games, like the indie games, a lot of the indie games don't require a lot of processing power, I think, that you would need on some of these higher-end games.

37:43.623 --> 38:10.463
[SPEAKER_06]: but there are those higher end games that they're also on Steam and a lot of those are the ones that support the controllers so it's going to be hard granted a lot of stuff is going to come down in cost and you can probably build something a little bit cheaper but I think it's going to be difficult for them to come up with something that you can fit in a box small enough because you also have to worry about heat and everything fitting it into a console sized box it's going to be a lot of engineering to get it right

38:11.023 --> 38:16.525
[SPEAKER_08]: Akuma JP in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, what's wrong with being a chubby?

38:18.225 --> 38:20.426
[SPEAKER_08]: There is nothing wrong with being a little fluffy.

38:23.107 --> 38:27.488
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll notice in that whole thing I just talked about, I didn't say I was going to throw out my Windows PC.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.409
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, there's still things that I'll want one of those for.

38:30.689 --> 38:32.470
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just want to take a quick look real quick.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.511
[SPEAKER_06]: The Alienware one.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.393
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, they have their console thing.

38:36.413 --> 38:37.994
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just, you know, an idea.

38:40.475 --> 38:42.937
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's the X51 mini gaming desktop.

38:43.237 --> 38:48.901
[SPEAKER_06]: And the base price, because it's from Dell, the base price you can pay for that is $699.

38:49.101 --> 38:49.801
[SPEAKER_06]: So, $700 for this console.

38:54.644 --> 38:56.946
[SPEAKER_06]: $699 US dollars.

38:56.966 --> 38:58.047
[SPEAKER_06]: $699 US dollars.

38:58.627 --> 38:59.848
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's what you get for $699.

39:01.129 --> 39:06.352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Core i3, which, I mean, that's not going to run some high-end stuff there.

39:07.233 --> 39:11.516
[SPEAKER_06]: You get 6 gigabytes of RAM, you know, a 1 terabyte hard drive.

39:12.276 --> 39:16.899
[SPEAKER_06]: GeForce 640 GT, which is a pretty good graphics card.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.801
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the top, top, top of the line.

39:20.361 --> 39:24.084
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, the Core i3 is really going to hurt it, I think.

39:26.206 --> 39:26.586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

39:26.666 --> 39:30.729
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems quite expensive to build something that form factor.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you don't need to pay Alienware to do it.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.933
[SPEAKER_06]: You can build your own smaller PCs for probably a lot cheaper than that.

39:36.434 --> 39:39.336
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what computer I'm hooking up to my TV as soon as I can?

39:40.017 --> 39:40.577
[SPEAKER_08]: The Commodore 64.

39:41.678 --> 39:58.293
[SPEAKER_08]: and I gotta say, tangent time, to Alan's credit, he told me that he was trying to get me a Commodore 64 for Christmas but it's probably not gonna come through because he tried to do an eBay auction and he didn't, you know, it's outside of his price range or whatever but I was like, damn, that would've been...

39:58.773 --> 39:59.414
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome!

39:59.694 --> 40:02.637
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, you just need to go down to the Denios or something like that.

40:02.857 --> 40:06.541
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I don't look every time I go to see if one's out there.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.283
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to make sure it works.

40:08.303 --> 40:11.706
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually do go by the thrift stores and keep an eye open, too.

40:11.726 --> 40:16.651
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my parents supposedly still have our old one, and my dad's kept it all these years, and it might still work.

40:16.711 --> 40:18.252
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said I want them to find it.

40:18.392 --> 40:20.574
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what I'm going to play on it.

40:20.614 --> 40:21.115
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing.

40:21.195 --> 40:22.977
[SPEAKER_08]: I just fucking want one, okay?

40:25.578 --> 40:26.279
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

40:50.956 --> 40:51.516
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Weird Al.

40:53.977 --> 40:57.899
[SPEAKER_08]: I did tell him, and this is advice for anybody that might be looking for this retrotastic machine.

40:58.299 --> 41:03.221
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget that there's also the Commodore 64C, which is totally fine.

41:03.641 --> 41:05.622
[SPEAKER_08]: It's smaller and has white keys.

41:06.182 --> 41:10.043
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like PS Mini and PS2 or whatever.

41:10.323 --> 41:11.184
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same type of thing.

41:11.984 --> 41:15.205
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the Commodore 128, which had 64 mode.

41:16.806 --> 41:18.746
[SPEAKER_08]: So 128s are totally fine.

41:19.467 --> 41:20.167
[SPEAKER_08]: Just throwing it out there.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.520
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody get robbed at Commodore 64.

41:22.860 --> 41:26.301
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunstar reminds us the C64 version of Donkey Kong was rad.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.683
[SPEAKER_08]: It was because it had the Pie Factory level.

41:30.463 --> 41:30.963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

41:31.203 --> 41:34.444
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is really supposed to be a metal, a cement factory or something, but it's pies.

41:34.544 --> 41:35.325
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the Pie Factory.

41:35.405 --> 41:36.065
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what you mean.

41:36.425 --> 41:40.907
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say that looks-wise, the ColecoVision version was really good.

41:42.028 --> 41:42.889
[SPEAKER_08]: for ColecoVision.

41:43.049 --> 41:46.092
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, the Coleco version of Mousetrap was the best one ever.

41:46.852 --> 41:47.533
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

41:47.593 --> 41:48.754
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, more news.

41:49.275 --> 41:49.955
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh, Rob.

41:50.055 --> 41:51.677
[SPEAKER_08]: Less ColecoVision, something more current.

41:51.697 --> 41:53.458
[SPEAKER_11]: How about Nintendo being buttheads?

41:54.759 --> 41:58.663
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know what you can't do, at least according to Nintendo of Europe?

41:59.324 --> 42:02.466
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot access 18 related content at certain times of the day.

42:03.027 --> 42:05.809
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, you get a little message that says, you can't do this, meh.

42:07.351 --> 42:17.299
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually, one of the NeoGAF users actually had the issue and contacted Nintendo of Italy's customer support and got this message.

42:18.020 --> 42:25.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear customer, we would like to let you know that Nintendo is always aimed to offer gameplay experiences suited to all age groups.

42:25.766 --> 42:31.892
[SPEAKER_11]: Observing carefully the relevant regulations regarding content access that are present in the various European countries.

42:32.537 --> 42:35.300
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like in that same voice you should be saying, For English, press 1.

42:35.580 --> 42:36.441
[SPEAKER_11]: Para Español, marque numero 2.

42:52.230 --> 42:52.570
[SPEAKER_08]: WaterShowerSauce

43:13.650 --> 43:17.213
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's like, you've got to be up all night to download anything.

43:17.273 --> 43:17.653
[SPEAKER_11]: Meh.

43:18.654 --> 43:20.335
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, ugh, whatever, Nintendo.

43:20.696 --> 43:22.197
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they've done this crap here, though.

43:22.217 --> 43:22.877
[SPEAKER_11]: Have they?

43:23.058 --> 43:23.178
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

43:23.438 --> 43:23.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

43:24.219 --> 43:27.121
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I guess Nintendo really doesn't like Europe.

43:27.881 --> 43:30.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless they want to give them RPGs that we want.

43:30.424 --> 43:33.186
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's because Nintendo doesn't like Europe, Jamie.

43:33.226 --> 43:34.507
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's some type of...

43:35.067 --> 43:37.190
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't like Italy.

43:37.310 --> 43:41.195
[SPEAKER_08]: My gut would say it's a law thing, but I'm like, I don't think there is a law.

43:41.636 --> 43:42.797
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a culture thing?

43:43.058 --> 43:45.841
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a cover your ass type of thing, which is all Nintendo ever does.

43:47.243 --> 43:52.550
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think they would have tried to do it here too, except I think Reggie probably put his foot down or shoved up someone's ass and said no.

43:54.227 --> 43:59.832
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird because I want to come out and say this isn't bad.

44:00.092 --> 44:01.012
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I'm doing a search.

44:01.173 --> 44:03.835
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is bad because I should be able to get what I want.

44:04.375 --> 44:09.459
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad if it only comes on when you have parental controls on.

44:09.919 --> 44:11.301
[SPEAKER_08]: Then that's a great idea.

44:11.361 --> 44:13.782
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be a great idea for parental controls.

44:14.183 --> 44:19.547
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, honestly, why would you want your kids using the shop unattended anyway?

44:21.469 --> 44:22.830
[SPEAKER_11]: They can let kids drink wine.

44:23.942 --> 44:26.502
[SPEAKER_11]: But they can't see boobs or blood.

44:26.542 --> 44:28.563
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't have boobs in video game.

44:28.603 --> 44:31.303
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, in Europe's culture, boobs are a little less.

44:31.343 --> 44:33.244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because America is freaking backwards.

44:33.364 --> 44:34.264
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, exactly.

44:34.604 --> 44:38.345
[SPEAKER_08]: So violence is much more of a thing over there.

44:38.585 --> 44:48.746
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe that's the difference because we're so desensitized through a lot of the movies like Saw and all that shit, which is taboo over there.

44:49.066 --> 44:50.067
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's the difference.

44:50.347 --> 44:50.767
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

44:50.807 --> 44:52.087
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everyone needs to get over it.

44:53.891 --> 45:07.932
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's my thing is I wonder if this was kind of a shock for the third parties that are involved in this because if you think about it, that's why am I going to put my game on your marketplace if you're going to limit the sale to only four hours out of a 24-hour day?

45:08.393 --> 45:09.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Brilliant question.

45:10.384 --> 45:12.347
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt In all reality, yes.

45:12.767 --> 45:14.790
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to know what the third parties have to say about it.

45:14.971 --> 45:16.433
[SPEAKER_11]: Who, by the way, sent me a Hanukkah card.

45:16.874 --> 45:18.576
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt, my first one of the year.

45:18.937 --> 45:24.325
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, he actually says parental controls are hard for parents, especially stupid ones.

45:26.878 --> 45:27.219
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

45:51.405 --> 45:52.466
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:09.464 --> 46:09.944
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, fuck.

46:11.205 --> 46:21.989
[SPEAKER_06]: This person that knows about these games is probably most likely going to be able to read most of the blogs out there on the internet and go, hey, well, all I have to do is download this at 11 p.m.

46:22.229 --> 46:23.490
[SPEAKER_06]: And they downloaded it at 11 p.m.

46:23.510 --> 46:28.792
[SPEAKER_08]: Kids shouldn't be using this parent's credit card on the store at any hour of the day.

46:29.032 --> 46:30.252
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know whose problem that is?

46:30.693 --> 46:31.313
[SPEAKER_09]: Their parents.

46:31.873 --> 46:33.594
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's whose problem it should always be.

46:33.814 --> 46:34.294
[SPEAKER_09]: Their parents.

46:34.834 --> 46:35.574
[SPEAKER_06]: See, here's the thing.

46:35.594 --> 46:37.175
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not be using their card.

46:37.215 --> 46:43.216
[SPEAKER_06]: They may be buying a prepaid card at a store and putting it in that way.

46:43.316 --> 46:43.836
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

46:44.076 --> 46:45.577
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's ways around everything.

46:45.697 --> 46:47.817
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, there's ways around everything.

46:47.897 --> 46:48.677
[SPEAKER_06]: So why limit it?

46:48.797 --> 46:53.698
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and I know the comment about parental controls being hard earlier was said in jest or a joke or whatever.

46:53.758 --> 47:00.760
[SPEAKER_08]: But seriously, when you first turn on the Wii U, the first time you're going through the initial setup,

47:01.260 --> 47:02.080
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a question.

47:02.481 --> 47:04.862
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you wish to enable parental controls?

47:04.982 --> 47:05.863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes or no?

47:06.583 --> 47:12.607
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the parent has to do is be there when their $400 machine is turned on for the first time.

47:13.327 --> 47:18.830
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm pretty sure if this is like any other Nintendo console or device that comes with... $300, excuse me.

47:18.970 --> 47:26.254
[SPEAKER_06]: Four thick fucking manuals that probably tell you how to set up parental controls if you really wanted to.

47:26.595 --> 47:26.735
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

47:27.395 --> 47:28.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

47:45.103 --> 47:46.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Censorship is a fucking bitch ass whore slut

48:01.667 --> 48:02.207
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what it is?

48:02.227 --> 48:02.548
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

48:02.848 --> 48:10.713
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that these violent game trailers and games on the internet are very disturbing to elderly people who thankfully do not stay up past 11.

48:12.255 --> 48:15.497
[SPEAKER_08]: Although... Yes, they all just magically fall asleep right before 11.

48:16.217 --> 48:17.699
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why, though, that it only goes till 3.

48:18.039 --> 48:20.260
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of them do wake up quite early in the morning.

48:20.360 --> 48:24.043
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's that 11 to 3 period that most elderly people are asleep.

48:24.143 --> 48:26.044
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why they're hiding this.

48:26.165 --> 48:27.125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not because of the kids.

48:27.245 --> 48:28.046
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the elderly people.

48:28.266 --> 48:32.949
[SPEAKER_08]: VX, Jason, XV, and Chap wants to throw out a theory, and it's a good one, so let me throw it out there.

48:33.730 --> 48:47.880
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo is classified as a media service, TV, and now they have to abide by TV laws, which restricts content to those hours in some countries.

48:49.338 --> 48:50.198
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a bad thought.

48:51.239 --> 48:54.640
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this because Nintendo is not treating itself as a game device anymore?

48:54.700 --> 48:56.501
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember, they make their own fucking rules.

48:56.561 --> 48:57.801
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not an X-Gen system.

48:58.142 --> 48:59.442
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Nintendo-Gen system.

49:00.302 --> 49:02.123
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is now a television.

49:02.683 --> 49:06.425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so, because look at the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

49:06.725 --> 49:13.708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say they have as many, if not more, streaming content on there than Nintendo.

49:13.908 --> 49:14.188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

49:14.768 --> 49:18.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you restrict the rules to one console and not the others?

49:18.569 --> 49:21.690
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is just something Nintendo is doing on their own.

49:22.571 --> 49:27.252
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is anything they're forcing them to do because why aren't they forcing the other guys to do the same thing?

49:30.633 --> 49:31.794
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just Nintendo asshattery.

49:31.854 --> 49:32.374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what they do.

49:34.818 --> 49:43.681
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's ass-hattery, but it's very throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which we've seen Nintendo do so many times before, like Friend Codes.

49:44.341 --> 49:50.204
[SPEAKER_08]: Friend Codes was set up to protect, you know, kids, and we all had to suffer for it.

49:51.004 --> 49:55.125
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same dumb decision that screwed that up that's screwing this up.

49:55.445 --> 49:56.706
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God it didn't happen here.

49:58.257 --> 50:02.620
[SPEAKER_08]: Although at the same time, do you really need to download Zombie U online?

50:02.640 --> 50:04.882
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't you just go to the store and buy it or get it on Amazon?

50:06.423 --> 50:07.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, just wait.

50:08.604 --> 50:12.487
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Amazon, there's a perfect way you can do that.

50:13.748 --> 50:14.669
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

50:15.149 --> 50:19.152
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be the point of downloading this stuff to your console?

50:19.192 --> 50:19.432
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

50:21.169 --> 50:22.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll throw this out there for what it's worth.

50:45.123 --> 51:11.134
[SPEAKER_08]: you don't have to pay tax on them right now technically you do, you have to report that to the state and your taxes at the end of the year but let's be real, who's doing that so you get them tax free that's not that much of a savings and you get the 10% kickback from Nintendo if you have a Wii Deluxe or Wii U Deluxe which most people probably do that have the Wii U right now I don't think that would be much of a motivator for me

51:12.708 --> 51:13.188
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

51:13.849 --> 51:15.189
[SPEAKER_08]: That is something.

51:17.271 --> 51:18.671
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get it right now.

51:18.892 --> 51:21.213
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, an hour from now when it finishes downloading.

51:22.454 --> 51:23.874
[SPEAKER_08]: Faster than Amazon.

51:26.356 --> 51:28.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

51:28.217 --> 51:31.479
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Wii U has sold 425,000 units in the US after being out there for a week.

51:38.934 --> 51:41.195
[SPEAKER_06]: So compare that to some of the other systems.

51:41.215 --> 51:49.220
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the Xbox 360 and PS3 and the original... Well, the original Wii, I want to say, sold only 300,000 units during that same time period.

51:50.961 --> 51:51.661
[SPEAKER_06]: The original Wii?

51:51.902 --> 51:53.162
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they say in that same article it's 475.

51:53.462 --> 51:53.162
475?

51:53.502 --> 51:53.863
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

51:53.883 --> 51:57.685
[SPEAKER_06]: It sold 475 in its first week, but I'm talking about actually now.

51:57.705 --> 51:58.645
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it sold only...

52:07.110 --> 52:09.571
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was 300,000 units or something like that.

52:09.651 --> 52:10.651
[SPEAKER_06]: It was still pretty high.

52:11.631 --> 52:15.652
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the Xbox 360, I think it was three quarters of a million.

52:15.992 --> 52:19.693
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to say the PS3 was like five or something like that.

52:22.034 --> 52:22.934
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it's pretty good.

52:23.194 --> 52:23.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my thing, though.

52:24.534 --> 52:27.395
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is unlike the Wii.

52:27.415 --> 52:30.896
[SPEAKER_06]: See, remember with the Wii, the whole reason was shortages on this stuff.

52:31.796 --> 52:43.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Last I checked, I went to the store, like I went to Walmart one day, and I was like, you know what, I'm just going to go walk down Electronics Island and see what they've got as far, let's see if they have any Wii U's, just see if they've finally gotten stocked.

52:43.965 --> 52:46.267
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a stack of 10 Wii U's.

52:46.407 --> 52:49.269
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't like, oh, people are clamoring to get this stuff.

52:49.389 --> 52:50.991
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just sitting there, no one gave a shit.

52:51.751 --> 52:57.055
[SPEAKER_06]: and same with like you go on like GameStop and you can do a search of their inventories and stuff like that.

52:57.235 --> 53:04.400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd say about the majority, well, all of them had some stock on them and some of them had quite a bit of stock on them.

53:04.780 --> 53:13.486
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that they were doing more to replenish them, but I'm thinking that the demand on this isn't as high as they had hoped.

53:13.867 --> 53:18.370
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, 425,000 sounds awesome, but is that going to dip off really fast?

53:18.430 --> 53:18.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Because...

53:20.431 --> 53:21.472
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just sitting there now.

53:23.134 --> 53:23.574
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

53:24.876 --> 53:25.256
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

53:25.837 --> 53:27.278
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's still too soon to tell.

53:27.518 --> 53:34.825
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to see what the entire holiday season looks like, and we need to see what the Fury looks like after the holidays.

53:35.406 --> 53:39.550
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, was it just a holiday thing, or is it still in demand in January and February?

53:39.870 --> 53:41.992
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what it's going to take to keep that demand going?

53:42.473 --> 53:43.354
[SPEAKER_08]: Games!

53:43.834 --> 53:44.695
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've got...

53:46.363 --> 53:48.444
[SPEAKER_08]: Pikmin in March.

53:50.264 --> 53:50.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U games.

53:51.105 --> 53:53.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me refresh my memory.

53:53.085 --> 53:53.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U games.

53:53.766 --> 53:58.147
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got 30 Great Games.

53:58.387 --> 53:59.027
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that game?

53:59.047 --> 54:04.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Family Party, 30 Great Games, Arcade, or Obstacle Arcade.

54:05.089 --> 54:09.331
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me you've seen the Miiverse stuff for the 30 Great Games stuff.

54:10.783 --> 54:19.625
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, Miiverse is becoming more and more one of the most genius things to happen in gaming ever.

54:20.146 --> 54:22.926
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not giving Nintendo all that credit.

54:23.006 --> 54:25.247
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an idiot savant type of genius.

54:26.047 --> 54:28.428
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unintended genius.

54:28.888 --> 54:31.529
[SPEAKER_08]: Miiverse is amazing.

54:32.389 --> 54:36.370
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen the stuff on Miiverse for some of these shovelware games that show up?

54:36.910 --> 54:37.910
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I gotta get the Wii.

54:38.110 --> 54:38.851
[SPEAKER_08]: You've gotta see this.

54:39.191 --> 54:43.592
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you'll laugh your ass off at some of the stuff that people are posting in Miiverse on these games.

54:43.812 --> 54:44.252
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

54:45.212 --> 54:52.534
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was gonna see, like, right now I'm looking just to see what's in this area, you know, as far as, like, availability.

54:53.154 --> 54:53.934
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see here.

54:54.534 --> 54:59.315
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one, Low Stock, In Stock, In Stock, In Stock, Low Stock, In Stock, In Stock, In Stock.

54:59.415 --> 55:02.476
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the, you know, first eight stores that they have there.

55:03.156 --> 55:06.897
[SPEAKER_06]: InStock, InStock, InStock, LowStock, InStock, LowStock, LowStock.

55:06.917 --> 55:14.100
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like within 20 miles of us, they are stocked at every single GameStop.

55:14.560 --> 55:20.462
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the same thing happening at Walmarts, Targets, probably everywhere.

55:20.582 --> 55:26.364
[SPEAKER_06]: So that begs the question, I mean, I understand this may be a hot holiday item, but...

55:27.904 --> 55:35.407
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's as in demand as they want everyone to believe it is.

55:35.907 --> 55:40.249
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't get me wrong, they have some pretty good games at launch, but they don't really have anything coming out.

55:40.929 --> 55:43.370
[SPEAKER_06]: The first Wii U game I can think of is in March.

55:44.231 --> 55:46.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Rayman Legends is the... Not March.

55:46.812 --> 55:49.053
[SPEAKER_06]: February 26th is Rayman Legends.

55:49.133 --> 55:52.954
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the first big game to come out next.

55:53.454 --> 55:53.535
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

55:55.185 --> 56:05.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, that's like a whole month and a half, almost two and a half months of nothing for the Wii U. I mean, that's kind of bad.

56:06.479 --> 56:09.482
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quite a drought of games.

56:13.547 --> 56:14.608
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56:39.591 --> 56:40.292
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56:59.668 --> 57:00.148
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on his head?

57:24.252 --> 57:25.534
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was from Nintendo Direct.

57:26.495 --> 57:32.042
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, it's just your average forum with all sorts of memes in here.

57:32.282 --> 57:38.230
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is Nintendo moderated and Nintendo endorsed on the console.

57:38.770 --> 57:41.814
[SPEAKER_08]: If you press pause and hit Miiverse, that is what you'll see.

57:42.659 --> 57:49.102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's cool that they're only removing offensive stuff, but not a lot of memes are offensive.

57:49.822 --> 57:53.144
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see a lot of the stuff with the jokes about shovels?

57:53.684 --> 57:57.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I understand the Nintendo seal of crap.

57:58.947 --> 58:01.548
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but I hardly call this genius.

58:01.608 --> 58:03.689
[SPEAKER_06]: I just call this your standard forum.

58:03.749 --> 58:05.049
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you not entertained?

58:05.670 --> 58:06.950
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not entertained.

58:09.451 --> 58:10.212
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just...

58:12.225 --> 58:13.767
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't... I don't know.

58:13.927 --> 58:15.269
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... This just in, everybody.

58:15.329 --> 58:16.311
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is not amused.

58:16.551 --> 58:17.993
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have Barry Potter.

58:22.098 --> 58:24.201
[SPEAKER_06]: And Batman that says, I have no family.

58:24.822 --> 58:25.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

58:27.452 --> 58:27.873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

58:28.233 --> 58:31.859
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is that great.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.523
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was better the first couple days.

58:34.784 --> 58:36.246
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it's wearing off.

58:37.187 --> 58:37.868
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

58:37.888 --> 58:40.973
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to look, DarkSakura?

58:40.993 --> 58:41.975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of funny, I guess.

58:43.336 --> 58:51.481
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, Panorama View was originally unveiled at E3, but they announced that it is coming in the spring, obviously.

58:51.781 --> 59:03.648
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming, Google Maps for Wii U. The Street View functionality with Google Maps will work with the gamepad just like Panorama View, because those Google cars take...

59:04.228 --> 59:08.491
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I better buy a Wii U so I can get Google Maps What's with the flying penis rocket ship?

59:34.725 --> 59:38.126
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Miiverse.

59:38.186 --> 59:41.348
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody tried to get away with drawing a penis on Miiverse, so they drew it as a rocket ship.

59:41.368 --> 59:42.508
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, this isn't uncomfortable.

59:44.369 --> 59:46.730
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I thought you played with the Wii U thing before.

59:47.831 --> 59:49.371
[SPEAKER_11]: Not with your little thing here.

59:50.372 --> 59:51.773
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to say anything about your little thing.

59:53.473 --> 59:53.753
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

59:56.495 --> 59:57.255
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

59:57.635 --> 59:58.836
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, it's actually your turn.

59:58.856 --> 01:00:01.257
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have to put the tablet down for a minute.

01:00:02.191 --> 01:00:03.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Take your evil away from me, Rob

01:00:05.814 --> 01:00:17.360
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, next, uh, there, and this, people have been going off about this, and, you know what, I was gonna be super skeptical of it until I actually did look at the logo.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:27.485
[SPEAKER_11]: Needless to say, I'm talking about the Phantom Pain, which, basically, it's a trailer of a guy that they had at the, um, VGAs.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:33.168
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy has a hook arm, and he's like, you're just waking up, and then a hundred feet soldier, brr,

01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:35.131
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting killed out here.

01:00:36.796 --> 01:00:40.205
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you look at the guy walking around, he's got a gray mullet.

01:00:41.858 --> 01:00:46.320
[SPEAKER_11]: And a shaggy beard when you can sort of see his face, but most of his face is covered up in bandages.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.881
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's missing a hand, he's got a hook arm.

01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:54.303
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's being put out by this Moby Dick Studios.

01:00:55.463 --> 01:01:00.845
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, I mean, I can't really think of anything how Moby Dick itself could be an allusion towards it.

01:01:01.185 --> 01:01:05.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, I mean, it's just a big revenge story, so maybe there's some revenge subplot?

01:01:05.147 --> 01:01:05.607
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:01:06.648 --> 01:01:09.531
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:01:23.184 --> 01:01:32.128
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, as I posted much earlier in the chat room, is that if you look at the logo, there are little chunks missing out of the text.

01:01:32.928 --> 01:01:52.077
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you use the same typeface and align it to these little markings that are coming out of the text, it perfectly fits the shape of Metal Gear Solid V. And I will relink the photo in the chat room for those who are curious.

01:01:53.017 --> 01:02:18.831
[SPEAKER_11]: but I mean and I mean I'm even looking it has to be of course in the same typeface but it is a perfect match it's sort of like they posted it there and then used the pathfinder tool in InDesign or something for anyone who knows what that is but it's I guess I see it now I didn't see it at first until I looked at the logo

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:24.923
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense that it's time for another Metal Gear Solid.

01:02:24.963 --> 01:02:27.845
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they always say the other one's going to be the last one, but come on.

01:02:28.606 --> 01:02:31.148
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll take that until it stops making money.

01:02:31.368 --> 01:02:31.728
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:02:31.908 --> 01:02:33.129
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's Metal Gear Solid.

01:02:33.609 --> 01:02:35.150
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's New Bionic Commando.

01:02:35.691 --> 01:02:36.351
[SPEAKER_06]: And spoiler!

01:02:36.391 --> 01:02:36.692
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:02:37.052 --> 01:02:38.673
[SPEAKER_06]: His wife is his claw.

01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:42.436
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:02:45.057 --> 01:02:45.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiler!

01:02:45.778 --> 01:02:48.100
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look at the picture that I linked in the chat room, guys.

01:02:50.154 --> 01:02:54.636
[SPEAKER_06]: The Supreme Court is going to decide next year if I get to get married or not, but you can marry your AI.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.987
[SPEAKER_11]: To quote Rob, put her in a CD, I don't care.

01:03:22.307 --> 01:03:25.308
[SPEAKER_06]: They had all those tubes and they're like, we need to fill the tubes with something.

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:29.169
[SPEAKER_06]: So they just threw his wife in a wood chipper, shoved her in the tubes for the final commando.

01:03:30.729 --> 01:03:32.369
[SPEAKER_06]: You shouldn't put your wife in a wood chipper.

01:03:32.429 --> 01:03:33.029
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.650
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll say she can't, but put her in there anyway.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:38.011
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he didn't put her in a... I don't know.

01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.511
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you put your wife in a wood chipper?

01:03:40.631 --> 01:03:41.091
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really rude.

01:03:41.111 --> 01:03:46.373
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he's just really into self-gratification and so, you know, he thought his wife is the claw.

01:03:47.193 --> 01:03:47.773
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.

01:03:48.753 --> 01:03:49.033
[SPEAKER_11]: Men.

01:03:49.734 --> 01:03:51.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the claw touches him and weighs it.

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:52.496
[SPEAKER_11]: The claw.

01:03:52.976 --> 01:03:53.777
[SPEAKER_06]: His hand can't.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.699
[SPEAKER_11]: It decides who will go and who will stay.

01:03:56.659 --> 01:03:59.581
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we please, please get to release dates?

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:00.042
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

01:04:00.062 --> 01:04:02.364
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I'm not expecting to hear an awful lot, but let's see.

01:04:02.904 --> 01:04:03.484
[SPEAKER_06]: Release dates.

01:04:03.985 --> 01:04:04.385
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:04:04.485 --> 01:04:08.548
[SPEAKER_06]: So this week we've got the game of the year, The Walking Dead.

01:04:09.669 --> 01:04:13.092
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hulk basically season one on PS3 and Xbox 360.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_06]: 007 Legends on the Wii U Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U

01:04:29.804 --> 01:04:54.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U like with Vanna White and shit awesome 60 bucks it's the game that they yeah it's like 40 I think it's the game that they put out on the Wii and Xbox 360 earlier I like Wheel of Fortune I'm real good at it well there you go and Jeopardy Jeopardy on the Wii U I'm not as good as Jeopardy that's for smart people um

01:04:57.278 --> 01:04:58.159
[SPEAKER_11]: Not anymore, really.

01:04:58.219 --> 01:04:59.640
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever watched Jeopardy lately?

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.661
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only watch Celebrity Jeopardy.

01:05:03.823 --> 01:05:04.923
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn you, Trebek!

01:05:05.884 --> 01:05:11.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing transformed on the Vita.

01:05:12.429 --> 01:05:14.490
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was like, isn't that on every platform?

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:16.591
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not the Vita.

01:05:16.611 --> 01:05:16.932
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DS.

01:05:17.152 --> 01:05:19.193
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DS got delayed a little further.

01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:21.795
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it!

01:05:22.035 --> 01:05:24.997
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate to say it, I think that's it for the rest of the year.

01:05:25.017 --> 01:05:25.057
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

01:05:27.158 --> 01:05:27.518
[SPEAKER_06]: Port Royale 3

01:05:48.605 --> 01:05:51.528
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't recognize this as a series here.

01:05:51.809 --> 01:05:59.597
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in August, I think.

01:05:59.637 --> 01:06:00.918
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a Pirates game.

01:06:01.038 --> 01:06:02.640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a Pirates simulation game.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.222
[SPEAKER_08]: But not Sid Meier's Pirates.

01:06:04.322 --> 01:06:08.687
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Calypso, I want to say, puts that out.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:11.010
[SPEAKER_06]: Russell in Japan.

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:16.413
[SPEAKER_06]: I think over here it's Calypso.

01:06:16.453 --> 01:06:18.354
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the guys that put out Tropico.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a trading sim.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:24.798
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Pirate or Trader.

01:06:25.798 --> 01:06:31.184
[SPEAKER_08]: Much busier week on the PlayStation 3, Battlefield 3 also there as well, and Port Royale 3.

01:06:31.665 --> 01:06:36.690
[SPEAKER_08]: Ninja Gaiden Sigma also gets a price reduction along with Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus.

01:06:37.111 --> 01:06:46.361
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as new games go, Sango Kushi 12 comes out in regular and premium editions from Koei.

01:06:46.501 --> 01:06:47.362
[SPEAKER_08]: This is...

[SPEAKER_08]: Sengoku, Three Kingdoms Military-based, politics-based, or fundamental

[SPEAKER_08]: Depending where you order it from, yes.

01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:05.901
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys are dressed up like it all in like little suits.

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:09.445
[SPEAKER_08]: They're little chibi suit characters, but this one has an eye patch, so you know he's rough.

01:08:10.569 --> 01:08:11.490

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I will.

01:08:55.044 --> 01:08:56.685
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Puyo Puyo gets a price reduction.

01:08:56.705 --> 01:08:57.525
[SPEAKER_11]: Puyo Puyo.

01:08:58.786 --> 01:08:59.386
[SPEAKER_08]: No one cur.

01:09:00.427 --> 01:09:00.947
[SPEAKER_08]: I care.

01:09:01.948 --> 01:09:03.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, one cur.

01:09:04.089 --> 01:09:05.910
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it for Japanese release dates.

01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:08.792
[SPEAKER_11]: In Europe, not a damn thing.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:10.232
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

01:09:11.593 --> 01:09:12.674
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, not a damn thing.

01:09:12.714 --> 01:09:14.995
[SPEAKER_11]: The game will be out the entire week.

01:09:15.895 --> 01:09:18.557
[SPEAKER_11]: A different version for every system that has ever existed all week.

01:09:21.294 --> 01:09:21.735
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm serious.

01:09:23.217 --> 01:09:23.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a damn thing.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:25.921
[SPEAKER_10]: Just crickets?

01:09:26.402 --> 01:09:26.903
[SPEAKER_10]: Just crickets.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:28.205
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing until the 17th.

01:09:30.428 --> 01:09:31.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is not this week.

01:09:33.519 --> 01:09:36.101
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do a couple more stories before the classic game of the week then.

01:09:37.162 --> 01:09:44.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Motorola has failed to ban the Xbox in both the US and Germany.

01:09:45.067 --> 01:09:55.315
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently, I guess, a judge has ruled that Google's Motorola can't ban the sales of the Xbox 360 over patent dispute.

01:09:56.536 --> 01:10:01.479
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, no one had any comment on it and the case moves on.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.262
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's good and kind of what we thought would happen.

01:10:06.282 --> 01:10:14.587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they would ban the sale over that, but... Yeah, can you imagine if they just suddenly pulled the Xbox 360 off of shelves?

01:10:14.767 --> 01:10:21.570
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just gonna, you know, go through the courts right now and I'm sure at the end they're gonna settle or have to pay some sort of royalties or something.

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:24.932
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to, so we'll see.

01:10:25.072 --> 01:10:31.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to a game that once could have been, but it's not gonna be, Guitar Hero 7.

01:10:32.196 --> 01:10:34.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 7, at one point, it was going to happen.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:38.541
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in development, but Activision canned it in 2011.

01:10:39.162 --> 01:10:44.326
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all coming from an anonymous source via Kotaku, so take it with a huge grain of salt.

01:10:45.086 --> 01:10:46.688
[SPEAKER_08]: But it certainly sounds plausible.

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:51.552
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 7 was going back to the roots, meaning it was only going to use a guitar.

01:10:51.992 --> 01:10:54.974
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was going to lose the drums, the mic, and all that other stuff.

01:10:55.135 --> 01:10:58.037
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock Band kind of had the lock on that, so it was going to go back to just guitar.

01:10:58.417 --> 01:11:00.161
[SPEAKER_08]: But the guitar was gonna go through some changes.

01:11:00.722 --> 01:11:04.069
[SPEAKER_08]: A full six strings and an extra button in the neck.

01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:07.013
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the guitar apparently was expensive.

01:11:07.893 --> 01:11:09.394
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a disaster.

01:11:10.274 --> 01:11:10.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Unresponsive.

01:11:11.474 --> 01:11:13.575
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was not going to be happening.

01:11:14.455 --> 01:11:16.776
[SPEAKER_08]: Vicarious Visions was the team that was developing it.

01:11:17.536 --> 01:11:22.318
[SPEAKER_08]: They were going to do this thing where the music video would actually change for each song.

01:11:23.018 --> 01:11:29.381
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were trying to separate themselves from a rock band, which I applaud.

01:11:30.201 --> 01:11:30.941
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

01:11:30.961 --> 01:11:33.162
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess maybe this music video thing wasn't really working out.

01:11:34.682 --> 01:12:01.611
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe that would have been the theme, was like making music videos like MTV Apparently the songs were not that great either It was all the worst hits from the 1990s In other words, stuff like Closing Time and Sex and Candy Ugh, Closing Time The old, remember that's the old outro for this show I know, but But to tell you something else about that In magazine class last time we did it, not this semester but last year

01:12:02.699 --> 01:12:08.166
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of every class, he would play that song right before we had our meeting.

01:12:09.288 --> 01:12:10.529
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what that song makes me think of.

01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:14.011
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, some good conversation in chat.

01:12:14.492 --> 01:12:16.932
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJasonXV is like, why the jump to seven?

01:12:17.072 --> 01:12:23.293
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew there was Guitar Hero 4 and Orin G points out Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

01:12:23.393 --> 01:12:25.214
[SPEAKER_08]: So there were other games in between.

01:12:25.454 --> 01:12:27.194
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not even counting the spinoff games.

01:12:27.234 --> 01:12:28.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there was Band Hero.

01:12:28.534 --> 01:12:32.235
[SPEAKER_08]: There was... Was that the Taylor Swift one was Band Hero?

01:12:32.275 --> 01:12:32.975
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the family hero?

01:12:32.995 --> 01:12:34.455
[SPEAKER_10]: Who gives a crap about Taylor Swift?

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:35.056
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying.

01:12:35.076 --> 01:12:36.756
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a... There was Band Hero and then...

01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:39.393
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Hero for $20

01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:08.761
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

01:13:09.141 --> 01:13:11.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, the soundtrack is still awesome.

01:13:11.922 --> 01:13:13.502
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a game that could have won it for the soundtrack.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.203
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go back and play that game again.

01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:17.143
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some really good mixes in that game.

01:13:19.244 --> 01:13:20.144
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awfully sad.

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:27.326
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember a time when we didn't have seven versions of a particular game?

01:13:27.886 --> 01:13:28.426
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we did.

01:13:28.686 --> 01:13:29.526
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it was Mega Man.

01:13:29.727 --> 01:13:31.267
[SPEAKER_11]: No, unless it was Street Fighter II.

01:13:31.963 --> 01:13:32.723
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, there is that.

01:13:33.003 --> 01:13:33.404
[SPEAKER_08]: There is that.

01:13:33.824 --> 01:13:35.685
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this game before or after Street Fighter 2?

01:13:36.225 --> 01:13:43.488
[SPEAKER_08]: As we get into the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that is older or about the same age as Street Fighter 2.

01:13:43.528 --> 01:13:44.428
[SPEAKER_09]: Contemporary.

01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:48.950
[SPEAKER_08]: And say, hey, you should be playing this game this week, damn it.

01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:50.391
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, damn it.

01:13:51.111 --> 01:13:55.113
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is another one that Dan picked out because I couldn't think of anything.

01:13:55.813 --> 01:13:56.413
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunset Riders.

01:13:57.334 --> 01:13:58.074
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good pick.

01:13:58.094 --> 01:13:59.595
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you ever play it?

01:13:59.675 --> 01:13:59.915
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

01:14:01.414 --> 01:14:04.396
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunset Ride, and you know, actually, I have played it.

01:14:05.337 --> 01:14:13.682
[SPEAKER_11]: I just was, the only place that had one was in an arcade, which was a tilt arcade in Dothan, Alabama, and then it was gone.

01:14:16.591 --> 01:14:19.053
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunset Riders is a side-scrolling game.

01:14:19.613 --> 01:14:23.355
[SPEAKER_11]: You basically run around and shoot guys with your guns.

01:14:23.616 --> 01:14:28.759
[SPEAKER_11]: You jump from back to back of stampeding cattle and ride horses.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.183
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how the article says it's a fanciful Wild West.

01:14:35.706 --> 01:14:38.888
[SPEAKER_11]: Outlaws in the West

01:14:59.019 --> 01:15:05.885
[SPEAKER_11]: and in between each day it shows you a wanted poster of whoever it is and your reward and wanted dead or alive.

01:15:06.305 --> 01:15:07.106
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that type of thing.

01:15:08.227 --> 01:15:27.502
[SPEAKER_11]: So you play as Steve and Billy and their guns are Peacemakers which are faster and then you have Bob and Cormano which I don't even know if that's a real name but I was laughing because he's wearing a pink poncho and they have a few shotguns so they have wider shots and

01:15:29.306 --> 01:15:45.545
[SPEAKER_11]: in the two player mode you actually can choose the character you want to control before you start the game but in four player each person is assigned to a character kind of like how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was just like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which is clearly the engine this game is using just saying

01:15:47.822 --> 01:15:53.646
[SPEAKER_08]: This is definitely... They're trying to make Lightning Strike twice after that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.

01:15:53.846 --> 01:15:56.388
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clearly the same hardware, which is fine.

01:15:56.408 --> 01:15:57.649
[SPEAKER_11]: But this game has hookers.

01:15:58.469 --> 01:15:58.849
[SPEAKER_11]: See, look.

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:00.991
[SPEAKER_08]: He goes in the room, and there's a hooker.

01:16:01.131 --> 01:16:03.012
[SPEAKER_08]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had April O'Neil.

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:03.973
[SPEAKER_11]: She wasn't a hooker.

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:05.814
[SPEAKER_11]: She did have cleavage, though.

01:16:05.834 --> 01:16:07.275
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the pictures I've seen, she is.

01:16:08.176 --> 01:16:09.617
[SPEAKER_08]: Clearly, you haven't been on Tumblr.

01:16:10.377 --> 01:16:12.178
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, any... Whatever.

01:16:13.739 --> 01:16:14.080
[SPEAKER_08]: Dirty men.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.360
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone can be a hooker on Tumblr.

01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:15.921
[SPEAKER_08]: Dirty men.

01:16:16.581 --> 01:16:17.502
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially Hawkeye.

01:16:18.222 --> 01:16:21.424
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, the Hawkeye Initiative is awesome.

01:16:22.364 --> 01:16:28.067
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, you can jump from different floors, which use the joystick and jump, the usual thing.

01:16:28.388 --> 01:16:30.989
[SPEAKER_11]: You can shoot downwards, diagonally, or vertically while crouching.

01:16:31.009 --> 01:16:36.352
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's basic run and gun controls for a game like this.

01:16:37.132 --> 01:16:42.899
[SPEAKER_11]: You have badge shaped power ups that you get by beating these guys carrying sacks.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:48.045
[SPEAKER_11]: The silver badge gives you a second gun so you can shoot in two directions at the same time.

01:16:48.225 --> 01:16:53.170
[SPEAKER_11]: And the gold badge lets you fire continuously when you hold down the shoot button.

01:16:54.011 --> 01:16:55.353
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can use both power ups together.

01:16:57.194 --> 01:17:02.878
[SPEAKER_11]: There's eight stages and you basically have to reach the end of each stage and beat the bad guy and get your money.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:03.858
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeehaw.

01:17:04.839 --> 01:17:08.721
[SPEAKER_11]: Although when I saw the first boss, I was asking Dan today, is he not wearing any pants?

01:17:09.321 --> 01:17:10.882
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it looked like he wasn't wearing pants.

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:13.244
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was just the perspective in the game.

01:17:13.824 --> 01:17:16.205
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan said that the only people not wearing pants were the hookers.

01:17:17.406 --> 01:17:18.527
[SPEAKER_11]: And the cowgirl.

01:17:18.627 --> 01:17:19.307
[SPEAKER_08]: And those chickens.

01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:20.168
[SPEAKER_11]: And the chickens.

01:17:21.088 --> 01:17:22.189
[SPEAKER_11]: And the stampeding cattle.

01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:23.590
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not wearing pants either.

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:25.671
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?

01:17:26.291 --> 01:17:29.653
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Horse, which just makes me think of Bad Horse in, um...

01:17:54.971 --> 01:18:01.369
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Horrible The Smith Brothers El Greco Wouldn't that mean the Greek?

01:18:04.011 --> 01:18:05.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like Greco-Greek?

01:18:05.211 --> 01:18:05.811
[SPEAKER_11]: Spanish for Greek?

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:07.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

01:18:07.392 --> 01:18:08.433
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:18:08.513 --> 01:18:09.593
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Scalpem.

01:18:10.254 --> 01:18:13.475
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Scalpem, which is... Oh, insensitive.

01:18:13.915 --> 01:18:14.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Paco Loco.

01:18:15.916 --> 01:18:21.999
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sir Richard Rose, a Britishman who's shooting from the balcony behind two lions.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:27.602
[SPEAKER_11]: There were... I'm trying to find my favorite part, which is...

01:18:29.873 --> 01:18:31.174
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the stuff about the SNES version.

01:18:31.214 --> 01:18:32.335
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm going to get back into that.

01:18:32.615 --> 01:18:34.737
[SPEAKER_11]: There were two major ports.

01:18:34.757 --> 01:18:44.384
[SPEAKER_11]: There was the Mega Drive version, which was a Sega Genesis, where it actually, two of the characters in the Genesis version were given surnames when they didn't have one.

01:18:44.424 --> 01:18:46.726
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Billy Cool and Cormano Wild.

01:18:47.566 --> 01:18:49.028
[SPEAKER_11]: So they were Cool and Wild, apparently.

01:18:49.928 --> 01:19:04.793
[SPEAKER_11]: and only four of the eight bosses were there so the four chapters were divided into two stages and the bosses in this version were Greedwell, Pakoloko, Scalpum and Richard Rose and the bounties were different they were increased depending on who it was

01:19:06.393 --> 01:19:10.774
[SPEAKER_11]: and Genesis 1 had what looks like a two-player versus mode where you could fight each other in a gunfight.

01:19:11.635 --> 01:19:14.736
[SPEAKER_11]: The SNES version had fewer changes.

01:19:16.216 --> 01:19:31.441
[SPEAKER_11]: You could still play only up to two players at a time but it had all eight stages with their bosses and all the power-ups were the same but there were some different I would say censoring done.

01:19:32.321 --> 01:19:35.042
[SPEAKER_11]: The whore that I'm just going to call her a whore, I don't care.

01:19:35.402 --> 01:19:40.364
[SPEAKER_11]: She's supposed to be, I guess, like a bar girl, but she's totally done like an old west, you know, no-call girl.

01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:45.606
[SPEAKER_11]: She kisses the player in stage one and the saloon dancers in stage four.

01:19:46.126 --> 01:19:48.087
[SPEAKER_11]: They're dressed more conservatively.

01:19:48.267 --> 01:19:54.190
[SPEAKER_11]: The hunter dogs were taken out of the SNES version, but they were in the Genesis version.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:20:02.413
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Native American enemies were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpum, who was renamed to Chief Wigwam.

01:20:03.723 --> 01:20:05.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because that's just as good.

01:20:06.205 --> 01:20:10.909
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Dynamite Tossing Female Bandits were taken out as well, but they were still in the Genesis version.

01:20:12.651 --> 01:20:14.913
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, Sunset Riders.

01:20:15.293 --> 01:20:19.236
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I also think is funny, because you know how when you're reading the articles they have a C also?

01:20:20.297 --> 01:20:23.840
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that it lists Wild West CAW Boys of Moo Mesa.

01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:26.362
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just wonderful.

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:31.487
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the stage where you're going along the train shooting the bandits.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:33.470
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeehaw!

01:20:34.911 --> 01:20:39.774
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you say that, and then you mentioned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and now I'm thinking, yeehaw, Ninja Cowboy.

01:20:40.314 --> 01:20:43.756
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in chat, they were talking about Gunsmoke, the NES game.

01:20:43.776 --> 01:20:45.778
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, kind of like the other Western shooter game.

01:20:46.118 --> 01:20:46.338
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:20:46.358 --> 01:20:47.699
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good game.

01:20:47.779 --> 01:20:52.281
[SPEAKER_11]: See, Dan kept correcting me and saying Call Girl, and I'm like, it's a whore.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.003
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a whore.

01:20:55.223 --> 01:20:55.824
[SPEAKER_11]: A whore.

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:56.684
[SPEAKER_08]: She is a whore.

01:20:56.764 --> 01:20:58.065
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so my mom says, a whore.

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:01.530
[SPEAKER_11]: She walks the night.

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:02.670
[SPEAKER_11]: She is a tramp.

01:21:06.472 --> 01:21:06.792
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

01:21:06.812 --> 01:21:08.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Your classic game of the week.

01:21:08.413 --> 01:21:09.433
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunset Riders.

01:21:09.513 --> 01:21:11.574
[SPEAKER_11]: And no, I'm not doing Mass Effect for classic game.

01:21:11.614 --> 01:21:12.494
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not old enough yet.

01:21:13.855 --> 01:21:14.435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting there.

01:21:15.876 --> 01:21:16.956
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll classic game you.

01:21:17.276 --> 01:21:17.617
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:21:17.657 --> 01:21:18.697
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like it's that old.

01:21:19.597 --> 01:21:19.838
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

01:21:19.898 --> 01:21:20.898
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, Mass Effect.

01:21:20.998 --> 01:21:21.298
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:21:22.059 --> 01:21:23.619
[SPEAKER_08]: Games have to be at least ten years old.

01:21:23.659 --> 01:21:23.959
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.280
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, Fifth Dream.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.881
[SPEAKER_11]: My mom really actually does say it that way.

01:21:27.421 --> 01:21:27.561
[SPEAKER_11]: Hoomer.

01:21:27.581 --> 01:21:27.761
[SPEAKER_11]: Hoomer.

01:21:28.504 --> 01:21:28.845
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooer?

01:21:29.948 --> 01:21:31.151
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my granddaddy said it that way.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:34.419
[SPEAKER_11]: My granddaddy was from Bridgeport, Connecticut and my mom's a southern girl.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.403
[SPEAKER_11]: So it translated to Hooer.

01:21:37.338 --> 01:21:38.399
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, enough whore talk.

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:39.959
[SPEAKER_08]: More talk about the classic game of the week.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:40.920
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more whores!

01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:41.980
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunset Riot.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.961
[SPEAKER_11]: Whores need love too, only they charge for it.

01:21:45.122 --> 01:21:46.463
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got plenty more show to come.

01:21:46.723 --> 01:21:50.285
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk some Microsoft, Cloud Gaming, Idolmaster.

01:21:50.525 --> 01:21:51.105
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Idolmaster.

01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:51.725
[SPEAKER_08]: And whores.

01:21:52.406 --> 01:21:53.106
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some whores.

01:21:53.947 --> 01:21:59.690
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some whores will call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:00.710
[SPEAKER_08]: That is our name on Skype.

01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:02.771
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be taking calls after the break.

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:06.313
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, stay tuned.

01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:22.082
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, December the 9th of 2012 with the 485th episode of our show.

01:22:22.322 --> 01:22:24.063
[SPEAKER_08]: We're about to get into rapid fire news.

01:22:24.443 --> 01:22:28.246
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself and Loki here in the studio and DarkSakura in the kitchen.

01:22:28.326 --> 01:22:30.367
[SPEAKER_08]: She volunteered.

01:22:30.387 --> 01:22:30.788
[SPEAKER_08]: She's in there.

01:22:30.808 --> 01:22:32.669
[SPEAKER_08]: She's making more latkes.

01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:38.213
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, you are not prepared for the mountain of latkes that are going to be here when you get home.

01:22:38.773 --> 01:22:39.894
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you like potatoes.

01:22:41.815 --> 01:22:42.456
[SPEAKER_08]: and Matza.

01:22:42.716 --> 01:22:43.297
[SPEAKER_08]: They're good though.

01:22:43.657 --> 01:22:44.198
[SPEAKER_08]: Not gonna lie.

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:45.259
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.104
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, while she finishes those up, we will get into some rapid fire news.

01:22:49.445 --> 01:22:50.907
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta talk about this real quick though.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:53.770
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you play a lot of fighting games, Loki?

01:22:53.931 --> 01:22:55.272
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't talk a lot about fighting games.

01:22:55.292 --> 01:22:55.893
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you play a lot?

01:22:56.213 --> 01:22:56.794
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

01:22:56.834 --> 01:22:57.255
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really?

01:22:57.615 --> 01:22:58.797
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever play Capcom vs. SNK 2?

01:23:00.834 --> 01:23:02.315
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:23:26.012 --> 01:23:26.672
[SPEAKER_08]: and what have you.

01:23:26.913 --> 01:23:30.075
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys during the podcast don't get that, but we play some music.

01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:34.619
[SPEAKER_08]: And while the Capcom vs. SNK 2 song was playing, somebody in chat said, where was this?

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:41.825
[SPEAKER_08]: SGO100Matt said, there isn't an HD remix of Capcom vs. SNK 2 coming out anytime soon, huh?

01:23:42.285 --> 01:23:43.927
[SPEAKER_08]: And it made me think, no, there's not.

01:23:44.007 --> 01:23:48.471
[SPEAKER_08]: And that made me sad that there is no... Oh my god, that's a lot.

01:23:48.531 --> 01:23:50.332
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you are making me so fat.

01:23:51.353 --> 01:23:52.274
[SPEAKER_08]: I am fat because of you.

01:23:56.727 --> 01:23:58.329
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, no HD version of it.

01:23:58.969 --> 01:24:03.454
[SPEAKER_08]: For me to sit on my fat ass and eat latkes and play Capcom vs. SNK 2 HD.

01:24:03.814 --> 01:24:05.176
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just not happening.

01:24:06.516 --> 01:24:06.896
[SPEAKER_06]: King of Fighters

01:24:27.516 --> 01:24:33.559
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so... I mean, I would imagine that Atlas would work with them.

01:24:34.019 --> 01:24:41.982
[SPEAKER_06]: After all, I don't know if you guys know this, Persona 4 Arena, best fighting game, which is very unusual.

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:53.126
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you would think that that might go to, like, Street Fighter X Tekken or something like that, or even... I don't know if it's too late, but PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or something like that.

01:24:53.647 --> 01:24:56.008
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, definitely going a little bit more niche with...

01:24:57.208 --> 01:24:58.169
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's winning these things?

01:24:58.429 --> 01:24:59.069
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:02.892
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sometimes the Oscars don't always go to the big budget movies.

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:03.893
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, they often don't.

01:25:04.073 --> 01:25:04.974
[SPEAKER_08]: They go to the niche stuff.

01:25:05.854 --> 01:25:07.355
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the VGA is taking a nod from that.

01:25:07.415 --> 01:25:07.715
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:25:08.476 --> 01:25:09.016
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

01:25:09.797 --> 01:25:10.177
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

01:25:10.517 --> 01:25:13.539
[SPEAKER_08]: Chatters are complaining that they are not getting latkes.

01:25:15.481 --> 01:25:15.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Come over.

01:25:19.079 --> 01:25:21.540
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, make your own damn latkes.

01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:24.282
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's gonna set off the smoke alarm, watch.

01:25:25.482 --> 01:25:26.423
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over, no, it's over here.

01:25:28.144 --> 01:25:28.864
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good idea.

01:25:30.145 --> 01:25:31.085
[SPEAKER_08]: The last thing we need.

01:25:32.166 --> 01:25:40.010
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say, that's one thing that hasn't happened in 11 years of Orange Launch Radio is that we've had to evacuate.

01:25:41.826 --> 01:25:45.349
[SPEAKER_06]: I've subbed the smoke alarm before when drinking bacon late at night.

01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:51.393
[SPEAKER_06]: But then we had the smoke alarm defense system where the giant fan aimed at the smoke alarm.

01:25:51.714 --> 01:25:53.075
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had the power go out.

01:25:53.575 --> 01:25:55.517
[SPEAKER_08]: We've passed out drunk during the show.

01:25:55.837 --> 01:25:57.298
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never had to evacuate.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.861
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that's true.

01:26:00.941 --> 01:26:02.362
[SPEAKER_08]: We lost the soundboard.

01:26:03.703 --> 01:26:04.203
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyway.

01:26:04.984 --> 01:26:07.286
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:26:08.286 --> 01:26:09.847
[SPEAKER_08]: Some quick news stories for you guys.

01:26:10.688 --> 01:26:11.589
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, starting us off.

01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:15.211
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Minecraft's getting another update, as they tend to do.

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:19.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we know the big update, the Redstone update, is coming in January.

01:26:19.594 --> 01:26:21.696
[SPEAKER_06]: But until then, they're going to get some smaller updates.

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:23.697
[SPEAKER_06]: 1.46 is going to be the next one.

01:26:24.117 --> 01:26:28.740
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the things you can expect for 1.46 that are actually available right now on Snapshot 12w49a include...

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:33.490
[SPEAKER_06]: Fireworks!

01:26:33.991 --> 01:26:38.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's only, I don't know, five months late, but fireworks are getting added in.

01:26:38.633 --> 01:26:41.074
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually craft different colored fireworks.

01:26:41.274 --> 01:26:47.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Fireworks that sparkle, fireworks that go higher, lower, and even fireworks that are shaped like creepers.

01:26:48.397 --> 01:26:57.404
[SPEAKER_06]: and then also there's supposed to be a book that you can use to enchant items and of course other bug fixes and stuff.

01:26:57.864 --> 01:27:03.889
[SPEAKER_06]: But 1.46 is supposed to be released sometime before Christmas, so next week or so.

01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:07.872
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who I found out today plays Minecraft?

01:27:08.913 --> 01:27:09.033
[SPEAKER_08]: Who?

01:27:09.093 --> 01:27:10.274
[SPEAKER_08]: My nine-year-old cousin.

01:27:12.759 --> 01:27:13.680
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was interesting.

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:17.442
[SPEAKER_06]: You can join the VOG Network.

01:27:18.022 --> 01:27:18.843
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't trust that.

01:27:18.863 --> 01:27:26.608
[SPEAKER_06]: We seriously had someone join this week, and they're like, is there seriously no one on here all the time?

01:27:26.628 --> 01:27:28.309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm on here.

01:27:28.849 --> 01:27:36.634
[SPEAKER_08]: And his mom was telling me, do you know how many viruses we've gotten on our computer because he keeps trying to find a free version of Minecraft?

01:27:37.142 --> 01:28:06.689
[SPEAKER_08]: there is no such thing as a free version of Minecraft they're all viruses we had to kind of explain that because it's like yeah you have to log in with your account and all that stuff you can play on cracked servers is the only way he can get around that I said you can do the free version that doesn't have all the I mean he's 9 he's not going to miss all that stuff although he was asking me he's like have you ever built a nether portal I'm like no a 9 year old just kicked my ass at a video game

01:28:08.646 --> 01:28:11.087
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't have to, because we did it all for you.

01:28:11.107 --> 01:28:12.108
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like 50 of them.

01:28:12.388 --> 01:28:13.989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

01:28:14.429 --> 01:28:18.131
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so The Last of Us was revealed to be coming out May 7th.

01:28:18.151 --> 01:28:20.673
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming from the trailer that played during the VGAs.

01:28:21.373 --> 01:28:23.054
[SPEAKER_06]: So yay, another game.

01:28:24.695 --> 01:28:32.599
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, in the realm of I don't give a shit about this, but we're going to report it anyways because originally it had something to do with gaming, but now it's so far away from gaming.

01:28:33.519 --> 01:28:37.821
[SPEAKER_06]: G4, or what used to be G4, is now becoming the Esquire Channel.

01:28:38.001 --> 01:28:40.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I could really care less about that.

01:28:40.302 --> 01:28:43.583
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I do care as little about that as possible.

01:28:44.044 --> 01:28:49.326
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently it is a network that is going to be aimed at the metrosexual male community.

01:28:49.386 --> 01:28:49.987
[SPEAKER_08]: Fashion, Cooking, Travel

01:29:11.138 --> 01:29:12.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Vomit is what I say.

01:29:13.538 --> 01:29:14.779
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:29:14.899 --> 01:29:18.839
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope this crashes and burns pretty fast.

01:29:18.939 --> 01:29:20.640
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I think it will.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.040
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, do you think metrosexual is hot?

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever that's supposed to mean anyway.

01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:25.561
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

01:29:26.141 --> 01:29:26.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Metrosexual?

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:28.021
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, and I'm like, huh?

01:29:29.061 --> 01:29:29.921
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to know, though.

01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:31.062
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it authentic.

01:29:31.422 --> 01:29:34.202
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know, are they going to be running reruns of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?

01:29:34.222 --> 01:29:36.683
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's pretty metrosexual right there.

01:29:37.363 --> 01:29:38.243
[SPEAKER_06]: They should reboot it.

01:29:39.238 --> 01:29:40.399
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, what was Alan telling you?

01:29:57.250 --> 01:29:58.390
[SPEAKER_08]: So... No, that's fine.

01:29:58.471 --> 01:29:59.231
[SPEAKER_08]: He listens to mine too.

01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:01.812
[SPEAKER_08]: But he likes to listen to... He's probably listening now, in fact.

01:30:02.872 --> 01:30:04.613
[SPEAKER_08]: He likes to listen to The Nerdist with Chris Harwick.

01:30:04.633 --> 01:30:13.516
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess they've been doing a lot of... Because I guess somebody involved with that show is involved with Attack of the Show right now after Kevin Pereira left and all that.

01:30:13.976 --> 01:30:17.218
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess they say that this network is supposed to be Brovo.

01:30:18.078 --> 01:30:19.058
[SPEAKER_08]: Is what they're calling it.

01:30:19.078 --> 01:30:19.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Brovo?

01:30:19.819 --> 01:30:21.379
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of Bravo, it's Brovo.

01:30:21.799 --> 01:30:22.380
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm like...

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.241
[SPEAKER_08]: The real dude bros of Orange County?

01:30:25.321 --> 01:30:26.522
[SPEAKER_08]: What exactly does that mean?

01:30:26.642 --> 01:30:28.424
[SPEAKER_08]: What is real dude bros?

01:30:28.984 --> 01:30:30.625
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty hilarious.

01:30:30.645 --> 01:30:32.766
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually would be a fucking awesome show.

01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:34.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

01:30:34.508 --> 01:30:35.048
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

01:30:35.088 --> 01:30:36.569
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you gonna do, man?

01:30:36.589 --> 01:30:36.889
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

01:30:36.909 --> 01:30:45.615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's there for dudes of, you know... Fist bump, Loki, fist bump!

01:30:45.635 --> 01:30:46.295
[SPEAKER_08]: Fist bump, yeah!

01:30:52.276 --> 01:30:53.017
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.124
[SPEAKER_08]: An update to the Humble Bundle.

01:30:57.484 --> 01:30:59.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you ever fist bump people, DarkSakura?

01:30:59.507 --> 01:31:00.048
[SPEAKER_09]: All the time.

01:31:03.053 --> 01:31:05.817
[SPEAKER_08]: The Humble THQ Bundle has added...

01:31:06.892 --> 01:31:07.312
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:33.873
[SPEAKER_08]: The Humble THQ Bundle By the way, you don't have to re-buy the bundle to get those games.

01:31:34.013 --> 01:31:38.775
[SPEAKER_08]: Just log back in to the Humble Bundle site or reuse your code, whatever.

01:31:39.215 --> 01:31:39.876
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get the games.

01:31:39.896 --> 01:31:42.357
[SPEAKER_08]: $2 million earned in 24 hours.

01:31:45.358 --> 01:32:08.156
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 days to go actually no that was 3 days left about 3.7 million made so it's probably up to about 4 million by now the average price of the bundle $5.58 and as the article here points out 4.5 shares of THQ stock same price amazing

01:32:09.986 --> 01:32:17.808
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know this was a thing, but more import games apparently still coming to the PlayStation Store in the form of PlayStation 1 Classics.

01:32:18.429 --> 01:32:26.571
[SPEAKER_08]: And GungHo Online America getting these old Japanese-only games and repackaging them for the PlayStation 1 Import Store.

01:32:26.911 --> 01:32:27.892
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great idea.

01:32:28.292 --> 01:32:38.055
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I'd play any of these games, but Zanuck x Zanuck, Kendo Rage sequel Makeruna Makendo 2,

01:32:39.715 --> 01:32:59.771
[SPEAKER_08]: Vehicle Cavalier, which was a vehicle combat game with mechs, Art Kamien Sugoro Kuden, that was a board game about Dekotora trucks in Japan, and Loop Salad, which was a match-three puzzle game, and Finger Flashing, which was basically a rock-paper-scissors action game.

01:32:59.832 --> 01:33:00.572
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Naked Fingers?

01:33:01.113 --> 01:33:01.313
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:33:01.713 --> 01:33:02.674
[SPEAKER_08]: Finger Flashing.

01:33:03.054 --> 01:33:03.555
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that.

01:33:03.575 --> 01:33:03.855
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

01:33:04.916 --> 01:33:08.138
[SPEAKER_08]: I just flashed one of my fingers at DarkSakura.

01:33:08.938 --> 01:33:10.419
[SPEAKER_11]: I retorted only to be polite.

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.662
[SPEAKER_08]: Streets of Rage apparently at one point had a remake.

01:33:14.782 --> 01:33:19.405
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what kind of stage this concept was in.

01:33:19.445 --> 01:33:21.407
[SPEAKER_08]: This could even be a fan thing for all we know.

01:33:21.866 --> 01:33:22.666
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

01:33:38.272 --> 01:34:06.540
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a little more open world than side scroller but it has that very neon look to it and you can watch the guys beating each other up there in the video Ubisoft level designer Sean Noonan that was the guy that leaked it through Twitter it was reportedly in development I'm sorry, he confirmed the leak through Twitter he didn't leak it himself reportedly was in development at Ruffian Games there was supposed to be destructible environments takedowns, street gangs

01:34:08.092 --> 01:34:09.073
[SPEAKER_08]: But cancelled.

01:34:10.294 --> 01:34:10.834
[SPEAKER_08]: Not happening.

01:34:13.737 --> 01:34:14.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess it just wasn't good enough.

01:34:15.858 --> 01:34:16.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Some things are not meant to be.

01:34:19.401 --> 01:34:22.964
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for my rapid fire news.

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:29.269
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now, did you ever have a TI calculator?

01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:30.070
[SPEAKER_08]: I sure did.

01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:31.211
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphing calculators?

01:34:31.271 --> 01:34:32.772
[SPEAKER_08]: In AP Calculus, I sure did.

01:34:33.174 --> 01:34:34.375
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I didn't take Calculus.

01:34:34.475 --> 01:34:36.016
[SPEAKER_11]: I had one just so I could play Pole Position.

01:34:36.876 --> 01:34:38.257
[SPEAKER_11]: And then make it say rude things.

01:34:38.337 --> 01:34:41.119
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on my way to take Calculus, and I was in pre-calc.

01:34:41.139 --> 01:34:43.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I spent too much time programming on my calculator.

01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:48.383
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game, but... And now we have Dissidia.

01:34:48.604 --> 01:34:49.104
[SPEAKER_06]: You should sue.

01:34:49.124 --> 01:34:49.644
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to quit.

01:34:50.665 --> 01:34:55.448
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now they've made Portal on a TI-85 calculator.

01:34:56.408 --> 01:35:00.031
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually play kind of a weird version of Portal where...

01:35:01.969 --> 01:35:07.075
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's like the Flash one, where it's just sort of from the side.

01:35:07.976 --> 01:35:11.000
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't really tell, the video was not playing on my network.

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:21.493
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was from the side, and you could shoot portals out in like eight directions, and they actually had puzzles and a little bit of a story that goes along, so it was pretty cool.

01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:23.341
[SPEAKER_11]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE NEXT SPRING

01:35:47.052 --> 01:35:48.914
[SPEAKER_11]: They will be seeing it.

01:35:49.414 --> 01:35:51.616
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of the Greenlight titles and I have it.

01:35:51.696 --> 01:35:52.437
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty.

01:35:52.697 --> 01:35:54.419
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't really gotten a chance to play much of it.

01:35:55.299 --> 01:35:57.962
[SPEAKER_11]: But we shall be seeing it on Xbox.

01:35:59.343 --> 01:35:59.643
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

01:36:00.644 --> 01:36:02.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's cool that it made its way to Xbox.

01:36:03.146 --> 01:36:04.467
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, not bad for Kickstarter, huh?

01:36:04.888 --> 01:36:05.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:36:05.657 --> 01:36:07.558
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fantastic game that I have yet to play.

01:36:08.819 --> 01:36:09.359
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

01:36:09.599 --> 01:36:10.019
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

01:36:10.119 --> 01:36:10.520
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it too.

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:14.982
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it because I backed the Kickstarter, but I haven't played it yet.

01:36:17.523 --> 01:36:26.788
[SPEAKER_08]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase cereal, as in breakfast cereal.

01:36:27.549 --> 01:36:29.130
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:36:37.222 --> 01:36:41.404
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook and Google+.

01:36:41.464 --> 01:36:44.746
[SPEAKER_08]: You smoosh it together, that's Foogle.

01:36:44.926 --> 01:36:48.968
[SPEAKER_08]: This week I was kind of a goober and I forgot to post the question in a timely manner.

01:36:49.528 --> 01:36:53.670
[SPEAKER_08]: So as soon as I joined chat they were like, Rob, you have not posted the Foogle question of the week.

01:36:54.130 --> 01:36:54.570
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't!

01:36:54.871 --> 01:36:55.191
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't!

01:36:55.551 --> 01:37:00.716
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of our chatters, Ragenator, just said, here, I'm going to give you a question totally free of charge.

01:37:00.796 --> 01:37:01.617
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, okay.

01:37:02.097 --> 01:37:04.319
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Ragenator's asking the Google question this week.

01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:10.205
[SPEAKER_08]: What is one thing that you learned, in quotes, from video games over the years?

01:37:10.225 --> 01:37:11.746
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was a good question.

01:37:11.806 --> 01:37:12.347
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:14.969
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:17.492
[SPEAKER_08]: So if one of you wants to ask the question tonight...

01:37:18.092 --> 01:37:18.612
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

01:37:19.132 --> 01:37:20.033
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was a great idea.

01:37:20.093 --> 01:37:21.393
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see what the listeners said.

01:37:23.714 --> 01:37:26.355
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start tonight on Google+.

01:37:26.995 --> 01:37:28.576
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a couple answers on Google+.

01:37:29.936 --> 01:37:35.818
[SPEAKER_08]: Redertainment says, Before Assassin's Creed, I didn't know Leonardo da Vinci was gay.

01:37:36.259 --> 01:37:38.379
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:39.260
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't...

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:43.924
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that true, or is that just a stereotype thing in the game?

01:37:44.184 --> 01:37:45.625
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a speculation.

01:37:46.146 --> 01:37:46.646
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

01:37:46.987 --> 01:37:50.350
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, you know, that type of thing was punishable by death back then.

01:37:51.291 --> 01:37:51.872
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunate.

01:37:52.312 --> 01:37:53.833
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft has an answer.

01:37:54.554 --> 01:37:54.914
[SPEAKER_08]: English.

01:37:55.655 --> 01:37:59.219
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I learned the language when I was little, but video games helped me master it.

01:37:59.619 --> 01:38:01.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite probably the reason I have a B.A.

01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:03.142
[SPEAKER_08]: in translation, too.

01:38:04.107 --> 01:38:05.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's... I hate it.

01:38:32.739 --> 01:38:35.221
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate music, Actdeft goes on to say.

01:38:35.902 --> 01:38:43.930
[SPEAKER_08]: I love music and video games helped me appreciate all kinds of music during my early years and especially during my teens.

01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:51.577
[SPEAKER_08]: Without that, probably I wouldn't be doing I love that music, which is a segment on VOGnetwork.com today.

01:38:52.157 --> 01:38:54.820
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned lots of trivial things too, but those two are the most important.

01:38:56.021 --> 01:38:57.443
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answers over there on Google+.

01:38:58.083 --> 01:38:58.964
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's try Facebook.

01:38:59.245 --> 01:39:00.646
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite a few answers on Facebook.

01:39:01.347 --> 01:39:03.670
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all pretty short, so I'll try to read as many of these as I can.

01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:05.692
[SPEAKER_08]: Reginator answered his own question.

01:39:06.513 --> 01:39:14.181
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned that, quote, herbs, quote, are good for your health, and I think those in Washington State would be inclined to agree.

01:39:15.122 --> 01:39:16.083
[SPEAKER_08]: I see the joke there.

01:39:16.804 --> 01:39:23.911
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really, though, there were a lot of, speaking of early RPGs, it was always the herb that would suddenly make you feel better and just make you forget all the pain.

01:39:23.951 --> 01:39:31.979
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to say when you mix the brown, sorry, the red herb and the green herb and you got the brown pile, we would just call it the brown pile or crap.

01:39:32.079 --> 01:39:35.923
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you mix the green herb and the pink herb and suddenly you want to watch a lot of My Little Pony.

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:36.924
[SPEAKER_08]: I figure.

01:39:37.426 --> 01:39:39.406
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing will make me want to watch a lot of My Little Pony, Rob.

01:39:41.567 --> 01:39:45.608
[SPEAKER_08]: Brandon H. on Facebook said, Don't try to text in the middle of a race.

01:39:46.408 --> 01:39:52.029
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that means Mario Kart or like an actual race, but just don't text and drive, kids.

01:39:52.409 --> 01:39:53.429
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't even work in games.

01:39:55.690 --> 01:40:01.251
[SPEAKER_08]: Katsuhiko J. replied and said, Save your game, save often.

01:40:01.611 --> 01:40:02.631
[SPEAKER_08]: Ain't that the truth?

01:40:03.843 --> 01:40:08.107
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely you've lost progress in Mass Effect due to lack of saving, yes, DarkSakura?

01:40:09.168 --> 01:40:10.909
[SPEAKER_11]: No, actually, because I save often.

01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:12.871
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you learned that lesson, huh?

01:40:13.231 --> 01:40:14.933
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have multiple saves at the same place.

01:40:15.013 --> 01:40:19.316
[SPEAKER_11]: I have different colors of skin and hair and different hairstyles and eye colors on my Shepard.

01:40:19.557 --> 01:40:19.817
[SPEAKER_08]: Nerd.

01:40:20.537 --> 01:40:26.182
[SPEAKER_08]: GamerGirl replied and said, Keep calm and keep playing because nothing in a game is as bad as real life.

01:40:26.623 --> 01:40:31.227
[SPEAKER_08]: At least, unlike life, in a game, there are do-overs and extra lives.

01:40:32.594 --> 01:40:32.714
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:40:32.734 --> 01:40:32.794
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:40:32.814 --> 01:40:32.894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:41:00.543 --> 01:41:01.544
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the first law of physics?

01:41:01.564 --> 01:41:05.347
[SPEAKER_11]: An object in motion tends to stay in motion, sir.

01:41:21.761 --> 01:41:22.201
[SPEAKER_11]: I just forgot.

01:41:48.632 --> 01:41:51.934
[SPEAKER_08]: BroSiden, I wonder if he'll have a show on Brovo.

01:41:52.255 --> 01:42:02.842
[SPEAKER_08]: BroSiden answers and says, don't ever think you're better than the game because the game decides if you're going to win or if it might just freeze and glitch and make your past 36 hours pointless.

01:42:03.523 --> 01:42:07.666
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to see the rule earlier, BroSiden, that says save now, save often.

01:42:08.972 --> 01:42:17.475
[SPEAKER_08]: Giovedea says, I've learned that when trying to perform operations on the Wii in Trauma Center, it is oftentimes easier to operate while drunk.

01:42:17.895 --> 01:42:20.136
[SPEAKER_08]: This makes me question real doctors.

01:42:20.976 --> 01:42:23.177
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, because Trauma Center is real life.

01:42:23.697 --> 01:42:27.718
[SPEAKER_08]: Your real doctors draw a pentagram shape in order to invoke the magic.

01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:34.994
[SPEAKER_08]: Burr replied and said, I learned you only live once.

01:42:35.294 --> 01:42:35.815
[SPEAKER_08]: YOLO.

01:42:37.096 --> 01:42:38.358
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, that can't be right.

01:42:38.918 --> 01:42:40.740
[SPEAKER_08]: You missed the one on the three lives.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:41.341
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

01:42:43.362 --> 01:42:46.284
[SPEAKER_08]: Cram replied and said, save often.

01:42:46.684 --> 01:42:50.667
[SPEAKER_08]: Having to replay several hours can leave a game unfinished for a long time.

01:42:51.788 --> 01:42:59.213
[SPEAKER_08]: Loco Poco replied and said, I've learned that flashing your breasts to your opponent is the best kind of fatality to finish them off.

01:42:59.793 --> 01:43:02.035
[SPEAKER_08]: Learned from Black Orchid and Killer Instinct.

01:43:04.997 --> 01:43:06.498
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a good life lesson, DarkSakura?

01:43:06.878 --> 01:43:09.040
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you flash your breasts at opponents to kill them off?

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.921
[SPEAKER_11]: I flash them at Dan to get him to shut up.

01:43:15.909 --> 01:43:22.590
[SPEAKER_08]: Silent Tom replies and says, I've learned over the years that the princess is always in another castle.

01:43:23.971 --> 01:43:26.872
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you chop down enough grass, you're bound to find money.

01:43:27.592 --> 01:43:29.532
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are both good life lessons, wouldn't you say?

01:43:31.053 --> 01:43:36.114
[SPEAKER_08]: Haseo Sumerugawa replies and says, If the camera focuses on it, it's important.

01:43:37.374 --> 01:43:37.934
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

01:43:38.074 --> 01:43:40.815
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Dead or Alive, the breasts are important.

01:43:40.835 --> 01:43:40.935
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:43:42.287 --> 01:43:48.669
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and you can find our community on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:48.909 --> 01:43:50.209
[SPEAKER_08]: I did learn something by the way.

01:43:50.329 --> 01:43:51.529
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good question Ragenator.

01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.969
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:53.450
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned something last night Rob.

01:43:54.210 --> 01:43:57.611
[SPEAKER_11]: My hacked Mass Effect 3 will now work in multiplayer.

01:43:58.911 --> 01:44:00.311
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as I don't hit the button.

01:44:02.152 --> 01:44:02.532
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh you.

01:44:03.072 --> 01:44:03.392
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:44:04.713 --> 01:44:05.993
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more news.

01:44:06.093 --> 01:44:06.333
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

01:44:07.256 --> 01:44:17.258
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's been a listing on LinkedIn, their one ads for, I guess, Microsoft's interactive entertainment business studio, Soho.

01:44:17.279 --> 01:44:22.460
[SPEAKER_06]: They're seeking a television producer to develop and deliver a number of new TV products.

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:27.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it says, Soho Productions is pushing the boundaries of Kinect

01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:28.201
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:44:51.773 --> 01:44:55.655
[SPEAKER_06]: So this kind of goes back to a few different rumors.

01:44:55.915 --> 01:45:03.199
[SPEAKER_06]: One, that this might be something that's incorporated into the next Xbox system, and also to that whole set-top box thing that they're going to be putting out.

01:45:03.939 --> 01:45:16.106
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, it sounds like they're kind of building on the whole Connect TV stuff, like what they did with Sesame Street and Nat Geo, that they're going to be doing some other types of...

01:45:16.926 --> 01:45:22.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Interactive TV things, maybe bringing back 1 vs 100 or something like that might be kind of cool.

01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:31.433
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what it sounds like to me, or maybe it's just something else, but hopefully it's not implemented really stupid like...

01:45:32.213 --> 01:45:37.214
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you can vote on this, you know, thing or something.

01:45:37.534 --> 01:45:39.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like Xbox or not?

01:45:39.075 --> 01:45:45.056
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think they were doing something similar for the Spike VGAs where they had it where you can stream it and interact with TV and stuff.

01:45:45.136 --> 01:45:46.777
[SPEAKER_08]: They were doing it for the political debates.

01:45:47.277 --> 01:45:47.557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:45:47.777 --> 01:45:48.457
[SPEAKER_06]: On Xbox Live.

01:45:48.477 --> 01:45:51.278
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe they're going to be kind of doing something like that.

01:45:51.838 --> 01:45:56.359
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like the way that they would go, but they're trying to maybe new content, which would be cool.

01:45:56.439 --> 01:46:01.080
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all for new content, especially if it's not any additional cost to me.

01:46:02.839 --> 01:46:13.765
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think we've known for a while that they're toying with the idea of doing like a Microsoft channel type of thing on Xbox or at least, you know, I don't know, more of that interactive kind of television style content.

01:46:13.965 --> 01:46:20.729
[SPEAKER_08]: Although it does seem weird that why would they close inside Xbox only to develop that kind of stuff?

01:46:20.749 --> 01:46:21.629
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the weird part.

01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:22.490
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:26.032
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think definitely something is in the works there.

01:46:28.351 --> 01:46:29.553
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that interests you, Loki?

01:46:30.474 --> 01:46:42.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, if it's at no additional cost to me, because I don't pay for cable TV right now, but I do pay for Xbox Live Gold, so it'd be nice if that was included with it.

01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:45.031
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd probably watch some stuff on there.

01:46:46.877 --> 01:46:50.879
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, going to a service called Playcast.

01:46:51.519 --> 01:46:56.722
[SPEAKER_08]: Playcast is an Israel-based company, and they're a cloud gaming service.

01:46:57.242 --> 01:46:58.863
[SPEAKER_08]: You can think similar to OnLive.

01:46:59.243 --> 01:47:05.186
[SPEAKER_08]: Playcast is live in Portugal, France, and South Korea, which is weird because they're Israel-based, but they're in these other countries.

01:47:05.586 --> 01:47:10.208
[SPEAKER_08]: But they are supposed to be launching the service in the United States early next year.

01:47:10.728 --> 01:47:11.849
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cloud service.

01:47:11.929 --> 01:47:16.011
[SPEAKER_08]: It streams through set-top boxes, tablets, smartphones, and PCs.

01:47:16.591 --> 01:47:20.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything that can run Android 4.0 and higher.

01:47:20.594 --> 01:47:24.376
[SPEAKER_08]: You do a subscription package that's tailored to a user.

01:47:24.897 --> 01:47:25.697
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of interesting.

01:47:25.777 --> 01:47:32.962
[SPEAKER_08]: So like in the service in France right now, there's a package that's more tailored to casual gamers and then one that's tailored at the more hardcore.

01:47:32.982 --> 01:47:38.606
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of like you would, I guess since we're talking about TVs and channels, you'd be buying like Comcast, right?

01:47:39.066 --> 01:47:46.151
[SPEAKER_08]: When you sign up for their service, you can get like the sports channel package or the entertainment channel package or whatever, movie channels.

01:47:46.611 --> 01:47:49.792
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of taking that idea to cloud gaming service.

01:47:50.833 --> 01:47:51.473
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

01:47:52.294 --> 01:47:52.694
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

01:47:53.514 --> 01:48:01.457
[SPEAKER_08]: Playcast is aiming towards what they call the mid-core market, a group that enjoys gaming but isn't going online in their favorite shooter every day.

01:48:01.878 --> 01:48:07.260
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe not the type of people that listen to this show, but people that still enjoy gaming.

01:48:09.245 --> 01:48:37.357
[SPEAKER_08]: apparently if you use multiple devices so like let's say you play on your TV through a PC and then you can now use your phone or tablet as a controller Playcast will instantly recognize the activity when you sign in with the auxiliary device you can create your own skins with the tablet or what have you and customize the look and layout of the interface no word on exactly when this launches in the US of course nothing on subscription prices da da da da da

01:48:37.697 --> 01:48:38.037
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

01:48:38.057 --> 01:48:38.117
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

01:49:00.974 --> 01:49:29.936
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know I'm not super big on these cloud gaming things and I'm more of the type of gamer where it's like I'll just buy the games I want to play but I can see the idea of you know go after the audience that maybe isn't as hardcore as I am I just don't want to put stuff that I'm paying for in somebody else's hands yeah it depends on the price though if it were super cheap it might be awesome but I kind of doubt it's going to be that cheap Dark Sakura

01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:31.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have.

01:49:36.135 --> 01:49:40.779
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is a... I've been reading Japanese release dates for how long on this show?

01:49:40.799 --> 01:49:41.039
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

01:49:41.059 --> 01:49:42.020
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I've heard of Idolmaster.

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.162
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, it's called leading into a story.

01:49:44.242 --> 01:49:44.642
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

01:49:44.662 --> 01:49:45.683
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my bad, my bad.

01:49:45.743 --> 01:49:51.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, Namco Bondi registered two different trademarks in Europe.

01:49:52.348 --> 01:50:00.455
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them is the Idolmaster and the other is Shiny Festa, which is one of the titles of a recent Idolmaster spinoff that's on the PSP.

01:50:01.776 --> 01:50:28.691
[SPEAKER_11]: so maybe we'll be getting Idolmaster I mean that looks like they're going to Europe first but I honestly think that if they did it there they'd do it here don't you think so I mean and really what this says um the the Idolmaster games you basically manage a pop star's career sort of like a Tamagotchi game Shiny Festa is just a rhythm game that sort of follows after Project D.Va

01:50:29.226 --> 01:50:30.906
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have to clean up their poop too?

01:50:30.946 --> 01:50:33.187
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Tamagotchi?

01:50:34.727 --> 01:50:35.808
[SPEAKER_11]: You have not taken a bath.

01:50:35.988 --> 01:50:36.468
[SPEAKER_11]: Go bathe.

01:50:37.768 --> 01:50:39.068
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:50:40.209 --> 01:50:40.349
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:41.649
[SPEAKER_06]: Bathe slower.

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:43.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Slower.

01:50:43.409 --> 01:50:43.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Rub.

01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.930
[SPEAKER_06]: And hence.

01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:46.050
[SPEAKER_06]: And hence.

01:50:46.610 --> 01:50:46.870
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

01:50:47.791 --> 01:50:48.851
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it could get localized.

01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:54.711
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty, well, we'll see.

01:50:54.811 --> 01:50:55.551
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

01:50:55.991 --> 01:51:05.017
[SPEAKER_08]: Trademark may not, I mean, it may just be preventing another company from coming in and releasing their own game called Idolmaster, but I don't know.

01:51:05.837 --> 01:51:07.698
[SPEAKER_08]: You would think there'd be an audience for it here.

01:51:08.399 --> 01:51:18.364
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be a huge thing like it is over there, but there's certainly enough people that are into the Japanese culture alone that would want to check it out just because it's been so big over there.

01:51:18.384 --> 01:51:22.787
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be a cult game, I think is what they'd call it.

01:51:23.464 --> 01:51:23.845
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

01:51:24.165 --> 01:51:28.010
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we've seen other things happen, you know, games like that gain popularity.

01:51:28.892 --> 01:51:30.954
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, would we have had Elite Beat Agents otherwise?

01:51:31.796 --> 01:51:31.916
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

01:51:33.849 --> 01:51:34.149
[SPEAKER_06]: Be neat.

01:51:35.070 --> 01:51:35.350
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:35.891
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my thing.

01:51:38.233 --> 01:51:39.373
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of funny.

01:51:39.413 --> 01:51:43.417
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking a little bit about Killer Instinct and boot flashing, so that's awesome.

01:51:43.897 --> 01:51:48.741
[SPEAKER_06]: But this may stop another Killer Instinct game coming out.

01:51:49.121 --> 01:51:59.049
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently Microsoft at least tried to renew the trademark of Killer Instinct, but it's been rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

01:52:00.456 --> 01:52:02.778
[SPEAKER_06]: on the basis of likelihood of confusion.

01:52:03.438 --> 01:52:09.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, this has to do with a short-lived Fox show called Killer Instinct from 1995.

01:52:10.563 --> 01:52:16.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know everybody that you talk about Killer Instinct thinks of the Fox show and not, I don't know, the fighting game series.

01:52:16.908 --> 01:52:18.009
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never heard of that show.

01:52:18.309 --> 01:52:20.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody at the trademark office did.

01:52:21.231 --> 01:52:25.894
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a really obscure person that probably, you know, that's my favorite show!

01:52:26.495 --> 01:52:29.297
[SPEAKER_11]: Same person probably also has episodes of Silk Stockings on tape.

01:52:32.093 --> 01:52:35.520
[SPEAKER_06]: Silk Stockings was awesome That was some good Skinamax right there

01:52:38.590 --> 01:52:42.432
[SPEAKER_06]: and David Duchovny, you rock on.

01:52:42.572 --> 01:52:52.078
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically they said that they're probably going to be trying to maybe appeal that or something.

01:52:52.238 --> 01:52:52.598
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:52:53.999 --> 01:52:59.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now they said this happens to a lot of trademark applications and by no means is the final say on the application.

01:52:59.602 --> 01:53:03.645
[SPEAKER_06]: It just means that Microsoft has to provide more evidence to overcome their objection.

01:53:04.258 --> 01:53:06.959
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say, you know, ask the average person on the street.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:11.102
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Killer Instinct, is that an arcade game or a show from 1995?

01:53:11.142 --> 01:53:12.743
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll be like, what?

01:53:14.924 --> 01:53:22.267
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at some clips of Killer Instinct here on, I'm thinking this is the intro to the show or whatever, here on good old YouTube.

01:53:23.148 --> 01:53:24.489
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, this is the movie.

01:53:24.509 --> 01:53:26.029
[SPEAKER_08]: Who does it star?

01:53:26.250 --> 01:53:27.330
[SPEAKER_08]: Marguerite Moreau.

01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:32.593
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... It's a lot of nothing in...

01:53:33.939 --> 01:53:34.619
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss her too.

01:53:35.819 --> 01:53:41.960
[SPEAKER_06]: That's... Totally... What?

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.921
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making a game based... They don't even talk.

01:53:43.941 --> 01:53:46.941
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making a game based on my favorite show from 1995.

01:53:47.021 --> 01:53:48.982
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fantastic.

01:53:49.002 --> 01:53:49.422
[SPEAKER_06]: 2005, actually.

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:50.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so you know.

01:53:50.702 --> 01:53:51.322
[SPEAKER_06]: It said 1995.

01:53:52.662 --> 01:53:54.703
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's 2005, that one that I'm looking at there.

01:53:54.903 --> 01:53:55.003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 2005.

01:53:55.083 --> 01:53:56.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

01:53:56.243 --> 01:53:56.403
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:53:57.083 --> 01:53:57.623
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wrong.

01:53:58.903 --> 01:54:02.584
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, the game was 95, wasn't it?

01:54:05.449 --> 01:54:06.530
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, maybe?

01:54:06.690 --> 01:54:09.992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was because I was in college in Alabama.

01:54:10.552 --> 01:54:10.933
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

01:54:11.093 --> 01:54:12.253
[SPEAKER_11]: Kicking people's asses!

01:54:13.394 --> 01:54:22.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's not that they make games based off of shows, like CSI has games, Survivor has games that aren't very good.

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:25.761
[SPEAKER_08]: Wheel of Fortune, you just said, has a game coming out next week.

01:54:26.302 --> 01:54:29.744
[SPEAKER_08]: So, surely Killer Instinct, a cancelled show from eight years ago.

01:54:29.944 --> 01:54:31.004
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 2005, my mistake, not 1995.

01:54:32.205 --> 01:54:41.531
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely a cancelled series from seven years ago might have a game at some point, so therefore... I know, considering that it ran a whole, what, 13 episodes?

01:54:42.011 --> 01:54:48.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, people would totally... No, I'm sorry, not even 13 episodes, because four of those episodes were unaired.

01:54:49.075 --> 01:54:54.118
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh... According to GameGuru, sounds like your typical cancelled Fox show.

01:54:54.538 --> 01:54:54.778
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:54:54.818 --> 01:54:56.239
[SPEAKER_06]: So nine episodes.

01:54:56.279 --> 01:54:58.981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, people are going to totally confuse it for that piece of shit.

01:54:59.741 --> 01:55:01.062
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure, you know.

01:55:02.116 --> 01:55:08.838
[SPEAKER_08]: We would get a Wonderfalls video game before we would get a Killer Instinct video game based off the show.

01:55:09.878 --> 01:55:11.098
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure this will be appealing.

01:55:11.118 --> 01:55:12.779
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, you know what this sounds like?

01:55:12.799 --> 01:55:17.540
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds like a really crappy rip-off of Law & Order SVU.

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:18.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably is.

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:23.021
[SPEAKER_06]: They're part of the, get this, the Deviant Crimes Unit, the DCU.

01:55:26.022 --> 01:55:27.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the DCU.

01:55:28.784 --> 01:55:31.525
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally not a ripoff of the SVU.

01:55:31.545 --> 01:55:36.787
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it just goes to show that intellectual property laws in this country are kind of borked.

01:55:37.168 --> 01:55:43.751
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, technically, by the same logic, this show shouldn't have existed in the first place because of the game.

01:55:44.994 --> 01:55:45.514
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

01:56:08.021 --> 01:56:09.502
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:56:27.697 --> 01:56:33.681
[SPEAKER_08]: An 8-bit fan game had a little preview this week, the Mega Man 25th anniversary.

01:56:34.462 --> 01:56:43.628
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a Canadian-based group, Team Reaverbot, but it's kind of a Voltron of various people here.

01:56:43.968 --> 01:56:51.414
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Julian Spillane from DHX Media or Silicon Knights, Jason Kanam from Drinkbox Studios,

01:56:52.094 --> 01:57:00.217
[SPEAKER_08]: Ori Falconer and Daniel Ochoa from Vast Studios and Tim McLennan from Gameloft and then an independent artist, Jeff Canan.

01:57:00.638 --> 01:57:08.141
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is, you know, again, it's kind of your basic NES throwback, but with like all new bosses and I can play a little preview here.

01:57:09.421 --> 01:57:15.444
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's not all that different from Mega Man 9 and 10, because people seem to love their retro Mega Mans.

01:57:15.964 --> 01:57:21.006
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, see, that guy actually shoots acid, which is in line with the theme stage here.

01:57:21.746 --> 01:57:23.567
[SPEAKER_08]: They even have all new bosses, right?

01:57:23.607 --> 01:57:32.531
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there's actually Sledge Man, Bio Man, Taro Man, Kendo Man, Amp Man, Neon Man, Comet Man, and Totem Man.

01:57:33.035 --> 01:57:33.696
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter X Mega Man

01:57:55.632 --> 01:57:56.132
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, yes.

01:57:56.212 --> 01:57:57.252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's what it is.

01:57:57.792 --> 01:57:59.933
[SPEAKER_08]: This was also something that was announced.

01:58:00.013 --> 01:58:01.313
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a little more official.

01:58:01.693 --> 01:58:04.154
[SPEAKER_08]: That other one was more of a like indie, whatever.

01:58:04.254 --> 01:58:05.614
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a little more official.

01:58:06.114 --> 01:58:06.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of, though.

01:58:07.094 --> 01:58:12.676
[SPEAKER_08]: The interesting thing about this, this project, the Street Fighter X Mega Man, has been going on for a while.

01:58:12.776 --> 01:58:17.457
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can find the guy's YouTube channel and find these old concept videos from like three years ago.

01:58:17.497 --> 01:58:19.357
[SPEAKER_08]: So this has been being worked on for quite some time.

01:58:19.938 --> 01:58:36.500
[SPEAKER_08]: at some point Capcom caught wind of it because now Capcom is going to be the ones that are sending it out through their Unity blog the Capcom Unity blog and they're going to make it a free download on December 17th, 2012 you know for all the shit

01:58:37.461 --> 01:58:40.743
[SPEAKER_08]: that Capcom gets for pissing off their fanbase over the past year.

01:58:41.184 --> 01:58:46.647
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very interesting kind of band-aid to try and make it right with the community.

01:58:47.168 --> 01:58:54.073
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, they see this indie project's going on and for all practical purposes they have every right to shut the damn thing down.

01:58:55.069 --> 01:59:00.815
[SPEAKER_08]: But they've learned from watching what happens to other stuff when that goes on that this is going to get out there to the internet anyway.

01:59:01.256 --> 01:59:08.424
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's embrace it, give the guy a little guidance, and then give it out as a goodwill thing for free and end up giving the guy some exposure.

01:59:09.064 --> 01:59:09.965
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks kind of neat.

01:59:10.826 --> 01:59:15.712
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of does the whole parody of Mega Man 2 here in the intro, but...

01:59:16.393 --> 01:59:27.529
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see, like, Ryu's stage, and it even does these interesting things where, like, the bosses have, because they're Street Fighter characters, have, like, super meters.

01:59:27.549 --> 01:59:28.109
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

01:59:29.881 --> 01:59:36.166
[SPEAKER_08]: The bosses have, like, super meters, and once they fill up, it'll do, like, this little zoom in, and they do their super attack.

01:59:36.186 --> 01:59:36.907
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of funny.

01:59:37.567 --> 01:59:43.812
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching some of the old concept videos online, so... It's really neat that it came to life.

01:59:44.673 --> 01:59:49.056
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wonder if the guy got any help officially from Capcom, or what.

01:59:50.778 --> 01:59:51.458
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:59:52.479 --> 01:59:53.800
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can get it free on December 17th.

01:59:56.753 --> 02:00:00.795
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, the super fan behind this, Sonic is the name he uses online.

02:00:01.395 --> 02:00:03.076
[SPEAKER_08]: Xiao Zong Hui.

02:00:03.556 --> 02:00:06.097
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a pro-competitive gamer, additionally.

02:00:06.978 --> 02:00:07.418
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

02:00:07.638 --> 02:00:08.859
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, I love this music.

02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:14.361
[SPEAKER_11]: The old end-of-game music.

02:00:14.941 --> 02:00:17.562
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Brental Floss did lyrics to it.

02:00:18.363 --> 02:00:18.783
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

02:00:20.564 --> 02:00:24.806
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I love looking at the little chibi Street Fighter characters done up in Mega Man style.

02:00:24.846 --> 02:00:25.506
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's awesome.

02:00:27.136 --> 02:00:47.619
[SPEAKER_08]: so alright going back to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com GameGuru commented on that last story about Killer Instinct saying that the TV show came out right as Nintendo let that Killer Instinct trademark expire so a small correction to me getting angry there a minute ago good to know

02:00:49.188 --> 02:00:57.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Tetsuya in chat talking on this Capcom Mega Man thing says, yeah, the way Capcom handled that made me even more interested in checking it out.

02:00:57.196 --> 02:00:59.298
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always down for more retro Mega Man.

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.984
[SPEAKER_08]: Panaxium in chat says, I'd play it if my reflexes weren't shit.

02:01:05.364 --> 02:01:06.185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting old.

02:01:07.306 --> 02:01:08.207
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you and me both.

02:01:09.946 --> 02:01:11.228
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully there's an easy mode.

02:01:12.649 --> 02:01:14.571
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Mega Man 2 style easy mode.

02:01:15.112 --> 02:01:16.213
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, more news.

02:01:16.333 --> 02:01:17.154
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

02:01:18.256 --> 02:01:18.496
[SPEAKER_08]: News?

02:01:18.596 --> 02:01:18.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

02:01:18.997 --> 02:01:19.657
[SPEAKER_08]: We're to the mailbag.

02:01:19.898 --> 02:01:20.318
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:01:20.959 --> 02:01:24.263
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the news is you all emailed us and now we're going to give you answers.

02:01:24.283 --> 02:01:24.863
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking hell.

02:01:25.564 --> 02:01:34.652
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna dive in the mailbag headfirst and pick out a few emails.

02:01:35.232 --> 02:01:40.016
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were actually kind of, like, some weeks we get no emails whatsoever.

02:01:40.436 --> 02:01:41.677
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, we got a bunch.

02:01:41.858 --> 02:01:42.818
[SPEAKER_11]: All the emails!

02:01:42.979 --> 02:01:43.659
[SPEAKER_08]: All the emails.

02:01:43.719 --> 02:01:47.322
[SPEAKER_08]: So DarkSakura, I think, can only read some tonight, but she's gonna pick some and read them.

02:01:47.342 --> 02:01:47.823
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go through them.

02:01:48.383 --> 02:01:48.803
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodie.

02:01:49.044 --> 02:01:51.546
[SPEAKER_11]: Searcher here, what are the good games?

02:01:51.766 --> 02:01:53.167
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, what are the good games?

02:01:54.648 --> 02:01:55.529
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the whole sentence?

02:01:55.749 --> 02:01:55.929
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

02:01:56.209 --> 02:01:56.770
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:57.831
[SPEAKER_11]: I like JRPGs.

02:01:57.851 --> 02:02:02.735
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, and Animal Crossing Wild World, which I guess that isn't really a JRPG.

02:02:02.795 --> 02:02:04.596
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more of a kind of a sim, I guess.

02:02:05.357 --> 02:02:06.438
[SPEAKER_11]: What are other good games?

02:02:06.738 --> 02:02:08.199
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think if the world ends with you?

02:02:08.539 --> 02:02:09.080
[SPEAKER_11]: Love the show.

02:02:10.702 --> 02:02:19.608
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna guess he left out a sentence for the DS Because all those games he named are DS games, right?

02:02:19.868 --> 02:02:22.509
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess So what are good DS games?

02:02:22.529 --> 02:02:34.777
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan likes Fire Emblem I mean, that's more of a strategy RPG You know what game is surprisingly good is the Card House one The Clubhouse games, that's what it is Clubhouse games was really good

02:02:35.117 --> 02:02:37.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's looking specifically for JRPGs.

02:02:38.218 --> 02:02:40.519
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you could play Final Fantasy 3, Final Fantasy 4.

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:45.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the Final Fantasy 4, 3 and 4 remakes are really good on DS.

02:02:45.582 --> 02:02:51.204
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, side story, did you hear about Final Fantasy 4 is getting its iOS release like Final Fantasy 3 did?

02:02:51.584 --> 02:02:51.784
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

02:02:51.984 --> 02:02:56.987
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy 4 is going to be coming out for what, Android and iPad and iPhone and all that stuff?

02:02:57.067 --> 02:02:57.447
[SPEAKER_11]: Android.

02:02:58.227 --> 02:02:58.887
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying.

02:02:59.448 --> 02:03:02.509
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out for all those systems before the end of the year, I think.

02:03:02.609 --> 02:03:03.269
[SPEAKER_08]: At least in Japan.

02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:04.390
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

02:03:06.531 --> 02:03:07.312
[SPEAKER_11]: Howdy, OLR.

02:03:07.372 --> 02:03:08.893
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your favorite catastrophic moggy.

02:03:09.273 --> 02:03:11.155
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, this week I come bearing sad news.

02:03:11.295 --> 02:03:16.099
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike every other time I've emailed recently where I bitch about release dates for certain games, or lack thereof.

02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:23.424
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the name will mean little to you, but earlier today, Sir Patrick Moore passed away at the age of 89.

02:03:23.924 --> 02:03:28.588
[SPEAKER_11]: He was best known as an astronomer and the host of the long-winning BBC TV show, The Sky at Night.

02:03:29.989 --> 02:03:30.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Total goodbyes.

02:03:58.033 --> 02:04:02.096
[SPEAKER_08]: I never saw it, so I don't have that emotional attachment, but I can imagine.

02:04:02.116 --> 02:04:04.477
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew who he was as an astronomer.

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:07.219
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine the day when Mark Summers passes away.

02:04:07.359 --> 02:04:08.740
[SPEAKER_08]: We are all going to have a cry.

02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:11.161
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all going to throw green slime at you.

02:04:12.242 --> 02:04:13.402
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's funny about Mark Summers?

02:04:13.543 --> 02:04:13.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

02:04:14.343 --> 02:04:16.985
[SPEAKER_11]: He was pathologically... Yeah, OCD.

02:04:18.024 --> 02:04:21.567
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as far as things, he hated dirty anything.

02:04:22.808 --> 02:04:23.689
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it was a job.

02:04:24.449 --> 02:04:28.953
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, going back to the DS email, Meteos is like my favorite DS game.

02:04:28.973 --> 02:04:30.234
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a puzzler and it's great.

02:04:30.634 --> 02:04:31.735
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I have my Puyo Puyo.

02:04:32.115 --> 02:04:34.938
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a JRPG, sorry, but Meteos is great.

02:04:34.958 --> 02:04:36.099
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying it's a great game.

02:04:36.519 --> 02:04:39.481
[SPEAKER_08]: Since he left out a sentence in that email, I'm just going to make up what it said.

02:04:40.622 --> 02:04:41.423
[SPEAKER_11]: Way to assume, Rob.

02:04:41.923 --> 02:04:42.644
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's what I do.

02:04:43.206 --> 02:04:49.431
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, hello OLR crew, this is Ramaditya from Indonesia.

02:04:49.551 --> 02:04:50.312
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's actually right.

02:04:50.572 --> 02:04:53.475
[SPEAKER_11]: This email is probably rather personal because we are fellow gamers.

02:04:53.855 --> 02:04:55.756
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's alright for me to ask your blessings.

02:04:55.897 --> 02:04:56.977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just got married.

02:04:57.358 --> 02:04:57.838
[SPEAKER_11]: Congrats.

02:04:58.819 --> 02:05:00.761
[SPEAKER_11]: I write this email soon after the party is over.

02:05:00.841 --> 02:05:01.701
[SPEAKER_11]: It's December the 9th.

02:05:03.563 --> 02:05:04.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute.

02:05:04.804 --> 02:05:09.808
[SPEAKER_08]: When the marriage and the celebration and the party is over, don't email your favorite podcast.

02:05:10.409 --> 02:05:11.589
[SPEAKER_08]: Get to the baby making.

02:05:13.126 --> 02:05:13.766
[SPEAKER_11]: Consumate.

02:05:16.967 --> 02:05:17.467
[SPEAKER_08]: Consumate.

02:05:17.587 --> 02:05:19.288
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to assume he meant after all of that.

02:05:19.328 --> 02:05:19.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:05:20.588 --> 02:05:24.029
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that marriage is such a common thing, but for me it is special.

02:05:24.749 --> 02:05:27.230
[SPEAKER_11]: What I mean is how it will make my gaming life special.

02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:30.371
[SPEAKER_11]: As a blind person like me, it is very difficult to enjoy video games.

02:05:30.811 --> 02:05:33.612
[SPEAKER_11]: An 8-bit, 16-bit era were the only great memories I could remember.

02:05:34.172 --> 02:05:36.013
[SPEAKER_11]: It is fortunate that my wife is also a gamer.

02:05:36.773 --> 02:05:37.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

02:05:56.636 --> 02:05:58.557
[SPEAKER_11]: The way I will play the game is like this.

02:05:58.697 --> 02:06:02.380
[SPEAKER_11]: She will explain to me what to do and I will play it with my game in the controller.

02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:04.401
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, go left, don't go right, etc.

02:06:05.462 --> 02:06:07.863
[SPEAKER_11]: That way, for instance, I can still play Galaxian and so on.

02:06:08.264 --> 02:06:11.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Our best collaboration was when we finished Contra with 30 lives code.

02:06:12.066 --> 02:06:12.827
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's all for now.

02:06:12.927 --> 02:06:17.610
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope this little story can inspire other people, even with disabilities, that they can still enjoy video games.

02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:19.751
[SPEAKER_11]: P.S.

02:06:20.251 --> 02:06:22.253
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll send you real-time video of how I play games.

02:06:22.713 --> 02:06:23.173
[SPEAKER_11]: P.P.S.

02:06:23.453 --> 02:06:24.834
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a little pic for my marriage party.

02:06:25.114 --> 02:06:25.895
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm going to look at it.

02:06:26.621 --> 02:06:27.222
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to look at it.

02:06:27.262 --> 02:06:28.423
[SPEAKER_08]: It was blocked on Facebook.

02:06:28.484 --> 02:06:29.885
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:06:30.727 --> 02:06:31.908
[SPEAKER_11]: We would love to enjoy your photo.

02:06:32.048 --> 02:06:33.731
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that story is so cute, though.

02:06:33.931 --> 02:06:34.211
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

02:06:34.351 --> 02:06:36.114
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just... That's great.

02:06:37.115 --> 02:06:37.996
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that story.

02:06:38.176 --> 02:06:38.477
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:40.840
[SPEAKER_08]: You and Dan...

02:06:41.921 --> 02:06:45.224
[SPEAKER_08]: You told me you guys kind of do something similar too in your relationship.

02:06:45.584 --> 02:06:49.407
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not facing a disability on the severity of blindness.

02:06:49.687 --> 02:06:51.388
[SPEAKER_08]: I face motion sickness.

02:06:51.809 --> 02:06:53.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, that's a thing.

02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:56.172
[SPEAKER_08]: And your ergonomic thing with your hand.

02:06:56.192 --> 02:06:57.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this was before my hand.

02:06:57.533 --> 02:06:57.793
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

02:06:58.153 --> 02:07:01.696
[SPEAKER_11]: But we would play Resident Evil 2 and I'd walk them through the game with the strategy guide.

02:07:01.956 --> 02:07:04.038
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because I couldn't watch the screen all the time.

02:07:04.078 --> 02:07:05.158
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd get a little motion sick.

02:07:05.378 --> 02:07:07.660
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's something we would do together.

02:07:09.161 --> 02:07:10.022
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so moving forward.

02:07:10.342 --> 02:07:12.363
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan and I leveled characters in Warcraft together.

02:07:12.383 --> 02:07:12.944
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we did.

02:07:13.544 --> 02:07:15.165
[SPEAKER_08]: We did his first character.

02:07:15.185 --> 02:07:16.145
[SPEAKER_10]: What about our paladins?

02:07:17.506 --> 02:07:18.327
[SPEAKER_10]: Our paladin pals?

02:07:19.047 --> 02:07:20.468
[SPEAKER_08]: You and I aren't in a relationship.

02:07:20.508 --> 02:07:21.388
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:07:22.029 --> 02:07:23.189
[SPEAKER_10]: Our paladin pals were fun.

02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:24.370
[SPEAKER_08]: They can be friends.

02:07:24.930 --> 02:07:27.292
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane and I have leveled at least three characters together.

02:07:27.312 --> 02:07:28.893
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fun friend thing to do, too.

02:07:28.953 --> 02:07:30.514
[SPEAKER_11]: I need someone to finish leveling.

02:07:30.534 --> 02:07:32.395
[SPEAKER_11]: We just set a time and we'll do it.

02:07:32.515 --> 02:07:34.536
[SPEAKER_11]: Help me level my stupid troll character.

02:07:35.898 --> 02:07:37.159
[SPEAKER_08]: God, anyway.

02:07:37.199 --> 02:07:39.762
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, Loki, do you and Nellie do any bonding thing?

02:07:39.782 --> 02:07:40.463
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, please.

02:07:42.065 --> 02:07:42.645
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

02:07:42.665 --> 02:07:44.207
[SPEAKER_08]: You play the game and she mocks you.

02:07:44.227 --> 02:07:48.251
[SPEAKER_06]: What was she asking the other night?

02:07:48.271 --> 02:07:51.395
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I don't know, like, what are you doing?

02:07:51.755 --> 02:07:53.557
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm hunting dingoes.

02:07:55.279 --> 02:07:56.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they eat your baby?

02:07:56.934 --> 02:07:57.575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care.

02:07:57.595 --> 02:07:57.735
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

02:08:12.265 --> 02:08:14.107
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey gang, I just thought I would drop a line and say hey.

02:08:14.647 --> 02:08:14.947
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

02:08:15.768 --> 02:08:19.672
[SPEAKER_11]: Watched the VGAs last night and I must say I was very impressed with the Game of the Year winner.

02:08:20.332 --> 02:08:22.494
[SPEAKER_11]: I just finished The Walking Dead about two weeks ago.

02:08:22.734 --> 02:08:28.900
[SPEAKER_11]: I found myself finishing an episode or sitting in my office and pondering whether the decisions I made were the right ones.

02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:30.961
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's when you know you've played a great game.

02:08:31.522 --> 02:08:37.607
[SPEAKER_11]: So good work, Telltale, for beating the Call of Duty's Borderlands and all the other big name AAA games.

02:08:38.127 --> 02:08:38.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Goes to show what you...

02:08:40.089 --> 02:08:41.931
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have played Sleeping Dogs.

02:08:59.335 --> 02:09:03.238
[SPEAKER_11]: I just started playing after picking it up on the Steam Thanksgiving sale and I'm pretty blown away.

02:09:03.658 --> 02:09:08.021
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't have a very high expectation when I started it, yet I am having a blast playing it.

02:09:08.942 --> 02:09:11.544
[SPEAKER_11]: So check it out if you haven't and if you have, what did you think?

02:09:12.444 --> 02:09:15.006
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was pretty fun, although I got bored of it pretty quick.

02:09:16.807 --> 02:09:22.371
[SPEAKER_11]: Now everyone stop what you're doing and it should be Y-O-U apostrophe R-E, not Y-O-U-R.

02:09:22.552 --> 02:09:24.173
[SPEAKER_11]: I will correct everyone who does this.

02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:26.441
[SPEAKER_08]: Grammar Lessons with DarkSakura

02:09:39.094 --> 02:09:42.418
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you haven't yet, go play The Walking Dead.

02:09:42.959 --> 02:09:43.840
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, one more thing.

02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:46.743
[SPEAKER_11]: After I complete Dogs That Aren't Awake, I'm going to pick up Far Cry 3.

02:09:47.504 --> 02:09:48.825
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't a fan of 2, though.

02:09:48.925 --> 02:09:50.307
[SPEAKER_11]: I have it on PS3 and Steam.

02:09:50.707 --> 02:09:54.331
[SPEAKER_11]: Just didn't find it appealing, so if any of you have played 2 or 3, your thoughts, por favor.

02:09:54.612 --> 02:09:55.713
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the good work, Travis.

02:09:56.792 --> 02:09:59.013
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Loki question as far as Far Cry goes.

02:09:59.153 --> 02:10:00.173
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't play Far Cry.

02:10:00.233 --> 02:10:03.774
[SPEAKER_08]: Walking Dead, I'm making it a point I will play that before the end of the year.

02:10:03.874 --> 02:10:08.535
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to name a game of the year until I've at least played that because that's what everybody really seems to be into.

02:10:08.675 --> 02:10:10.215
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm making it a point to play more Mass Effect 3.

02:10:12.076 --> 02:10:13.276
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty dull point.

02:10:13.816 --> 02:10:14.456
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

02:10:15.197 --> 02:10:15.817
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go ahead.

02:10:15.837 --> 02:10:16.637
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a butt bite it.

02:10:17.546 --> 02:10:17.986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Loki.

02:10:19.527 --> 02:10:20.367
[SPEAKER_06]: Far Cry 3 is awesome.

02:10:20.668 --> 02:10:22.388
[SPEAKER_06]: What about 2?

02:10:22.809 --> 02:10:28.011
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, I didn't play because the same reason why I didn't like Dead Rising.

02:10:28.411 --> 02:10:29.992
[SPEAKER_06]: You have malaria in the game.

02:10:30.412 --> 02:10:33.874
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to constantly give yourself medication bullshit like that.

02:10:34.454 --> 02:10:35.054
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that.

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:38.016
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Rising 2 sucked because of that crap.

02:10:38.396 --> 02:10:40.037
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got Dead Rising 2 off the record.

02:10:40.057 --> 02:10:41.137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, sweet.

02:10:41.457 --> 02:10:44.739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to worry about the stupid having to get medicine for a stupid girl.

02:10:45.459 --> 02:10:51.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but then, guess what, Frank West, he has the problem, and he needs to get the fucking Zombrex for himself.

02:10:51.164 --> 02:10:57.248
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, gone, get rid of this game, because it's absolute shit.

02:10:58.309 --> 02:11:01.612
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, I do not enjoy games that you have malaria in.

02:11:02.332 --> 02:11:04.774
[SPEAKER_06]: But Far Cry 3 is awesome, because you do not have malaria in that.

02:11:06.696 --> 02:11:08.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Malaria-free games are awesome.

02:11:09.658 --> 02:11:09.978
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

02:11:09.998 --> 02:11:10.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

02:11:11.263 --> 02:11:13.044
[SPEAKER_11]: I should call in sick to work with malaria.

02:11:14.205 --> 02:11:17.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry Mosquito bit me even though they're, you know, in larval stage right now.

02:11:19.169 --> 02:11:22.552
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, I'm a new listener and I've got to say that you guys have one awesome show.

02:11:22.732 --> 02:11:23.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

02:11:23.432 --> 02:11:23.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks.

02:11:24.233 --> 02:11:28.636
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only been listening for a few weeks and I already feel like you guys are close friends that I've known forever.

02:11:29.137 --> 02:11:29.477
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

02:11:30.318 --> 02:11:32.900
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had very similar problems and in my life I...

02:11:34.471 --> 02:11:35.452
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been having headaches.

02:11:35.532 --> 02:11:37.233
[SPEAKER_11]: My cat, Stripes, just passed away.

02:11:37.293 --> 02:11:37.773
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

02:11:38.894 --> 02:11:43.277
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've always, and he always laid in my lap while I played Minecraft and Xbox.

02:11:43.357 --> 02:11:47.960
[SPEAKER_11]: But the point is that you have a great way to make the show feel like a great chat with friends and keep up the good work.

02:11:49.061 --> 02:11:49.801
[SPEAKER_11]: That was our goal.

02:11:50.422 --> 02:11:51.462
[SPEAKER_11]: Mission accomplished!

02:11:51.522 --> 02:11:52.283
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

02:11:52.363 --> 02:11:53.123
[SPEAKER_08]: Mission accomplished.

02:11:53.143 --> 02:11:55.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for validating exactly what we sent out to do.

02:11:55.925 --> 02:12:04.191
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted this podcast to be exactly what dinner after playing DDR at the arcade for a night was, which was just sitting around,

02:12:04.732 --> 02:12:08.778
[SPEAKER_08]: Talkin' some smack, havin' a good time, bein' bros, right, Jamie?

02:12:09.179 --> 02:12:10.140
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, brofist.

02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:10.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Brofist.

02:12:11.182 --> 02:12:11.843
[SPEAKER_08]: Do bros.

02:12:13.346 --> 02:12:17.512
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, every time you say that, though, I think of John's WoW character, Bro Dude.

02:12:17.673 --> 02:12:18.834
[SPEAKER_11]: Bro Dude.

02:12:19.746 --> 02:12:23.029
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost made girl chick, just to be funny.

02:12:23.049 --> 02:12:23.469
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have.

02:12:23.729 --> 02:12:25.571
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have, but no one's ever on that server.

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:28.673
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyhow, thank you for validating what we're trying to do.

02:12:28.933 --> 02:12:29.094
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

02:12:29.114 --> 02:12:29.574
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

02:12:30.695 --> 02:12:31.595
[SPEAKER_11]: Greetings, OLR.

02:12:31.655 --> 02:12:32.876
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:12:33.597 --> 02:12:40.322
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.

02:12:40.362 --> 02:12:41.903
[SPEAKER_08]: His fried bologna hole?

02:12:42.124 --> 02:12:43.124
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what he called it?

02:12:43.345 --> 02:12:43.645
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:12:43.665 --> 02:12:43.865
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:12:46.766 --> 02:12:47.807
[SPEAKER_11]: Equating it to WoW.

02:12:48.067 --> 02:12:51.589
[SPEAKER_11]: You completely missed the fact that WoW is always updating and adding new things to the game.

02:12:52.089 --> 02:13:00.254
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that anything resembling logic runs through his brain before he opens his fried bologna hole without comparing COD to other games?

02:13:00.814 --> 02:13:04.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think they have a right or should charge for online play?

02:13:04.636 --> 02:13:07.838
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun fact, I don't play either COD or WoW as I hate them both.

02:13:08.018 --> 02:13:09.819
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, um, um, um.

02:13:10.399 --> 02:13:12.960
[SPEAKER_08]: Games do charge for online play.

02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:15.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you missed the online pass train?

02:13:16.841 --> 02:13:18.641
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you forget about that?

02:13:19.221 --> 02:13:20.042
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the thing.

02:13:20.062 --> 02:13:20.722
[SPEAKER_08]: What was he talking about?

02:13:20.742 --> 02:13:22.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Games charging for online play?

02:13:22.742 --> 02:13:24.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Read the first part of the email again.

02:13:25.003 --> 02:13:31.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer, equating it to WoW.

02:13:32.659 --> 02:13:35.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I agree with that in one state.

02:13:35.261 --> 02:13:36.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Only one reason.

02:13:36.062 --> 02:13:40.986
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if they went throughout where... Because a lot of people just buy it for the multiplayer.

02:13:41.327 --> 02:13:48.753
[SPEAKER_06]: In which case, if they sold it like Killzone, where they have the multiplayer version that you can buy for $15.

02:13:50.535 --> 02:13:51.235
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:14:11.175 --> 02:14:11.775
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

02:14:32.001 --> 02:14:34.003
[SPEAKER_06]: 8 million copies sold is just ridiculous.

02:14:34.023 --> 02:14:38.828
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't charge to play online when you're already charging to play online on the Xbox.

02:14:38.868 --> 02:14:40.229
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Xbox Gold is.

02:14:40.389 --> 02:14:46.295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, the minute I get double dipped for this shit, my Xbox is going for sale on eBay.

02:14:46.475 --> 02:14:47.816
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll even autograph it.

02:14:48.156 --> 02:14:48.837
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.

02:14:49.057 --> 02:14:49.398
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't

02:14:50.018 --> 02:14:51.159
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:15:21.856 --> 02:15:23.077
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see what you did there.

02:15:23.237 --> 02:15:23.997
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

02:15:24.778 --> 02:15:25.958
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

02:15:26.158 --> 02:15:26.739
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there more email?

02:15:26.979 --> 02:15:27.179
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

02:15:27.779 --> 02:15:29.500
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there is, but there was more to that one.

02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:30.361
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:15:30.501 --> 02:15:31.701
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, Good day, citizens.

02:15:31.862 --> 02:15:32.542
[SPEAKER_11]: Serious turtle.

02:15:33.547 --> 02:15:33.647
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

02:15:34.868 --> 02:15:37.348
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the last email that matters.

02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

02:15:39.689 --> 02:15:51.473
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure achievements and trophies aren't such a big thing for you guys, but do you sort of wish Steam's achievements added up to an overall gamerscore as with Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network, or even iOS slash Mac Game Center?

02:15:51.633 --> 02:15:57.095
[SPEAKER_11]: And that comes from Robert M. It'd be okay, but it's not a deal breaker.

02:15:57.155 --> 02:15:57.816
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really care.

02:15:58.636 --> 02:16:01.177
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, are we talking like a unified achievement system?

02:16:02.335 --> 02:16:07.359
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what the website Raptor tries to do a little bit.

02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:09.801
[SPEAKER_08]: R-A-P-T-R, I think it's spelled.

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:12.544
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what they're trying to do with their site.

02:16:12.624 --> 02:16:17.008
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but they try to track all your gaming accomplishments.

02:16:17.028 --> 02:16:25.395
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't track my game progress in Grand Theft Auto 4, although I know it's retroactive, but I played the fuck out of Grand Theft Auto 4 and it says I haven't played it at all.

02:16:25.515 --> 02:16:26.716
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that on 360?

02:16:26.836 --> 02:16:27.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:16:27.277 --> 02:16:30.500
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird because it picks up all my Mass Effect activity and all that stuff.

02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:33.863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but stuff that you'd play before you joined Raptor or during?

02:16:34.124 --> 02:16:35.325
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it picked up the before.

02:16:35.425 --> 02:16:36.126
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the hours.

02:16:36.146 --> 02:16:37.627
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't pick up the hours from before.

02:16:37.687 --> 02:16:40.130
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have because I played the fuck out of that.

02:16:40.770 --> 02:16:42.312
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you what, I hate the crap out of Origin.

02:16:43.911 --> 02:17:05.138
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too which is why I always at least run my Mass Effect 3 through Steam so that it'll pop up through Steam and then Origin I'm not sure there's a way to really unify all that though unfortunately like sorry to the emailer but I think some people are trying to create online I've heard of a gaming social network and I can't remember the name that I think is aspiring to do something very similar as well

02:17:05.558 --> 02:17:14.805
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have these different startups that are kind of competing to fill that void of your universal gaming badge, but nobody's really cracked into the mainstream yet.

02:17:14.865 --> 02:17:18.427
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Raptor's probably the biggest one I can think of, but they're not a Twitter.

02:17:18.467 --> 02:17:19.628
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not a Facebook yet.

02:17:19.668 --> 02:17:24.371
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still very, very niche, and I bet a lot of gamers still haven't heard of them.

02:17:25.232 --> 02:17:34.919
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun in chat says, Raptor's pretty nice, but there's plenty of stuff it doesn't track, like Minecraft with third-party launchers, and it tries to make you use their shitty web browser, but the stats are nice.

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:38.264
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you have it.

02:17:38.685 --> 02:17:39.126
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

02:17:39.206 --> 02:17:43.874
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you wish to send us emails in the future.

02:17:46.238 --> 02:17:47.681
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the part of the show where we get angsty.

02:18:06.166 --> 02:18:14.548
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually can't really say anything about it, so it's a blanket F you to a situation that I really can't do much about right now.

02:18:15.648 --> 02:18:15.968
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

02:18:16.668 --> 02:18:18.189
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you're being so expensive.

02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:29.051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually looking, I was just real quickly going through Newegg to see if I could create one of those Alienware PCs that they have for cheaper than obviously they offer them, and yeah, you probably can.

02:18:30.424 --> 02:18:33.528
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still expensive.

02:18:33.808 --> 02:18:34.850
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to latkes.

02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:36.812
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how fat you've made me tonight?

02:18:37.493 --> 02:18:37.753
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:18:37.994 --> 02:18:41.058
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how many hours on the treadmill I won't spend burning this off?

02:18:41.518 --> 02:18:41.778
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:44.502
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, potassium.

02:18:45.663 --> 02:18:46.284
[SPEAKER_08]: I eat bananas.

02:18:47.025 --> 02:18:48.207
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, potatoes have more potassium.

02:18:54.167 --> 02:18:55.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Unify me a study.

02:18:55.268 --> 02:18:56.129
[SPEAKER_08]: A scientific study.

02:18:57.591 --> 02:19:05.540
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's do a couple more news stories and then we'll go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:08.003
[SPEAKER_08]: But not just yet, we do have a couple more stories for you guys.

02:19:08.944 --> 02:19:09.185
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:19:09.605 --> 02:19:18.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because you know, Hitman has had its share of really bad marketing ideas, and well, there's yet another one.

02:19:18.108 --> 02:19:24.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently they had a Facebook promotion where you can do a higher Hitman app.

02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:34.057
[SPEAKER_06]: For Facebook, what it basically did was it allowed you to create these hits on different people.

02:19:34.237 --> 02:19:40.962
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, some of the reasons, I guess, Target identified by, and then there's a drop-down box, reason for target elimination.

02:19:41.482 --> 02:19:51.270
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the target identified by things are her small tits, or her muffin top, or her hairy legs, or her ginger hair, and that kind of stuff.

02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:52.771
[SPEAKER_06]: Some ridiculous things.

02:19:54.893 --> 02:19:56.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently people took offense to that.

02:19:56.874 --> 02:19:57.535
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you think?

02:19:57.935 --> 02:19:58.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:19:58.816 --> 02:20:01.098
[SPEAKER_08]: And then... Imagine that, Loki.

02:20:01.839 --> 02:20:05.722
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't possibly imagine how this could have possibly been offensive.

02:20:06.022 --> 02:20:09.746
[SPEAKER_08]: Putting a hit out on your friend because they have hairy legs and small tits.

02:20:10.526 --> 02:20:12.328
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't... I mean...

02:20:14.637 --> 02:20:15.698
[SPEAKER_08]: The Madness of it all.

02:20:41.872 --> 02:20:45.173
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess when they are killed, it tells the reason why.

02:20:45.653 --> 02:20:52.575
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because Bob thought that your tits were small and that you were cheating on your partner or some garbage like that.

02:20:54.075 --> 02:21:02.197
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess... Yeah, I guess people were kind of offended by that.

02:21:02.697 --> 02:21:05.118
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we're sorry for any offense caused by this.

02:21:05.498 --> 02:21:05.718
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

02:21:06.823 --> 02:21:07.424
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

02:21:31.485 --> 02:21:43.655
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine you woke up this week and imagine you go on Facebook and you check Facebook and you see a little thing that says Rob Roberts has put out a hit on you because you're a bitch and you smell.

02:21:44.696 --> 02:21:46.197
[SPEAKER_08]: How would you have responded to that?

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:47.599
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to cut that hooker.

02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:50.301
[SPEAKER_08]: I cut that bitch.

02:21:50.982 --> 02:21:53.564
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura apparently approved the app, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:53.604 --> 02:21:54.384
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't.

02:21:54.484 --> 02:21:54.985
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't.

02:21:57.006 --> 02:22:25.531
[SPEAKER_08]: I would cut a bitch though you would have written a 10 page paragraph about what bullshit that was as your status update I wouldn't I just ask people to explain certain social conventions that I find baffling SSJ100Matt says the fact that Square Enix dropped this so quickly tells me it was mostly behind their ad agency yeah I would think so

02:22:27.379 --> 02:22:35.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I'm guessing the team involved had zero women on it, or the few women they had were shut out or ignored.

02:22:35.626 --> 02:22:37.648
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, to be fair... You mean like DC Comics?

02:22:38.809 --> 02:22:43.572
[SPEAKER_08]: He's probably right, but just because I have to ask this, because I want to know the full story.

02:22:44.033 --> 02:22:48.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Could I put a hit out on a man for having small tits and hairy legs?

02:22:49.037 --> 02:22:49.837
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you could.

02:22:50.418 --> 02:22:53.000
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they would have those options, maybe.

02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:54.121
[SPEAKER_06]: They might, you know...

02:22:54.341 --> 02:22:55.742
[SPEAKER_08]: You do have rather small boobs, Rob.

02:22:55.782 --> 02:23:00.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they would sort them out because of, you know, by gender.

02:23:00.465 --> 02:23:01.426
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have different things.

02:23:02.127 --> 02:23:04.448
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, maybe small penis.

02:23:05.069 --> 02:23:05.829
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, right, right.

02:23:05.849 --> 02:23:06.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, I don't know.

02:23:08.091 --> 02:23:09.192
[SPEAKER_08]: Still not smart.

02:23:10.913 --> 02:23:11.714
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't mishear me.

02:23:11.734 --> 02:23:14.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of his large penis.

02:23:14.876 --> 02:23:17.118
[SPEAKER_06]: I put out a hit on him because his penis is too large.

02:23:17.798 --> 02:23:18.739
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:21.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know her?

02:23:21.461 --> 02:23:22.541
[SPEAKER_11]: Her dick is so little.

02:23:23.042 --> 02:23:23.122
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

02:23:25.166 --> 02:23:28.271
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't think it's even that necessarily it had zero women on it.

02:23:28.371 --> 02:23:30.875
[SPEAKER_08]: It had zero people that like...

02:23:32.475 --> 02:23:35.697
[SPEAKER_08]: are in the demographic they're trying to target.

02:23:36.337 --> 02:23:40.560
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the biggest problem with things like this.

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:48.304
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just imagine all these old fuddy-duddies sitting in a room talking about what's cool and what's hip and what the youngsters are into.

02:23:48.324 --> 02:23:50.725
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hip, I'm cool.

02:23:50.885 --> 02:23:52.946
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

02:23:53.146 --> 02:23:59.630
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had shown this to anybody, you would have been told, it's stupid.

02:24:02.159 --> 02:24:04.200
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dumb.

02:24:05.501 --> 02:24:05.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:24:06.562 --> 02:24:07.122
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

02:24:07.602 --> 02:24:11.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, good on them shutting it down as fast as they did, but lesson learned.

02:24:12.385 --> 02:24:14.807
[SPEAKER_08]: Screen that shit before it goes live.

02:24:15.747 --> 02:24:19.169
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

02:24:19.269 --> 02:24:20.130
[SPEAKER_08]: This is interesting.

02:24:21.638 --> 02:24:25.781
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever heard of a VRC6 cartridge back in the days, NES?

02:24:26.721 --> 02:24:29.323
[SPEAKER_08]: VRC, Memory Management Controller Chip.

02:24:29.363 --> 02:24:33.005
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something that Konami had on Famicom cartridges.

02:24:33.065 --> 02:24:37.828
[SPEAKER_08]: It would add three extra sound channels, allowing for richer audio.

02:24:37.888 --> 02:24:38.989
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's an example.

02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:44.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what Castlevania III sounds like in the U.S., in the NES.

02:24:48.965 --> 02:24:53.009
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's what it sounded like on the Famicom because of the three extra sound channels.

02:24:53.169 --> 02:24:54.069
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this version too.

02:25:01.656 --> 02:25:02.477
[SPEAKER_08]: Very different, huh?

02:25:02.497 --> 02:25:03.838
[SPEAKER_08]: You should hear how The Legend of Zelda sounds.

02:25:03.858 --> 02:25:08.261
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know how many fucking games were dumbed down with the sound because of it?

02:25:10.152 --> 02:25:11.113
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really cool.

02:25:11.253 --> 02:25:13.234
[SPEAKER_08]: A chiptune artist named RushJet1.

02:25:13.954 --> 02:25:15.574
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had his stuff on the station before.

02:25:15.615 --> 02:25:16.875
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this guy.

02:25:17.095 --> 02:25:22.297
[SPEAKER_08]: He has used the VR6 chip to remake the Mega Man 3 soundtrack.

02:25:22.697 --> 02:25:25.198
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Mega Man 3 was already fucking awesome, right?

02:25:25.498 --> 02:25:27.799
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so here's an example.

02:25:28.159 --> 02:25:30.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's Magnet Man's original theme.

02:25:31.441 --> 02:25:32.121
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the original.

02:25:39.898 --> 02:25:40.499
[SPEAKER_08]: A good song.

02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:41.360
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:41.721
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:25:42.201 --> 02:25:45.866
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is Rush Jet One's VRC6 version.

02:25:49.470 --> 02:25:50.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

02:26:02.658 --> 02:26:04.100
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little bit remixed, too.

02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:06.744
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't just take the original and overlay it.

02:26:06.804 --> 02:26:08.706
[SPEAKER_08]: He just completely kind of redid it.

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:12.030
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really cool.

02:26:12.251 --> 02:26:20.061
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually played through Mega Man 3 with the audio silenced, laid his tunes on top of the game footage.

02:26:20.581 --> 02:26:23.765
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when he gets to Wiley's Castle, it even goes through.

02:26:23.805 --> 02:26:26.409
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's awesome, this whole little video that's out there.

02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:28.992
[SPEAKER_08]: Proto Man's theme, everything is there.

02:26:29.513 --> 02:26:34.680
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can check that out at rushjet1.bandcamp.com where he distributes a lot of his stuff.

02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:35.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

02:26:36.943 --> 02:26:37.363
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

02:26:38.996 --> 02:26:47.001
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I mean, gosh, I want to go back and replay all these old games on a Famicom emulator just to hear how awesome the sounds were.

02:26:47.061 --> 02:26:50.783
[SPEAKER_11]: You really should hear the differences between the different versions of The Legend of Zelda.

02:26:51.684 --> 02:26:53.745
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is kind of night and day.

02:26:54.125 --> 02:26:57.387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:26:57.527 --> 02:26:59.929
[SPEAKER_08]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:00.489 --> 02:27:03.011
[SPEAKER_08]: And while we wait for some calls, let me see if I can bring that up here.

02:27:04.386 --> 02:27:05.426
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that you can find it.

02:27:05.627 --> 02:27:14.590
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's really just the fact that there was a little bit different instrumentalization on the two different ones, so... Let's see.

02:27:19.652 --> 02:27:20.352
[SPEAKER_10]: The disc version.

02:27:20.533 --> 02:27:21.573
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is the disc version.

02:27:26.915 --> 02:27:28.556
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going through the title screen and all that stuff.

02:27:28.696 --> 02:27:28.856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:27:28.876 --> 02:27:28.956
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:27:33.487 --> 02:27:33.787
[SPEAKER_08]: Normal.

02:27:33.988 --> 02:27:34.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

02:27:35.149 --> 02:27:36.430
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we'd have to get to, like, the dungeon.

02:27:36.450 --> 02:27:37.991
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me fast forward a little bit.

02:27:38.332 --> 02:27:39.353
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a lot richer.

02:27:39.413 --> 02:27:39.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

02:27:39.873 --> 02:27:41.495
[SPEAKER_08]: You can even hear an extra little ding.

02:27:42.296 --> 02:27:44.117
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if we can get to the dungeon.

02:27:46.119 --> 02:27:46.500
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:47.641
[SPEAKER_08]: You hear the difference in the sound?

02:27:47.661 --> 02:27:48.642
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:52.161 --> 02:27:55.283
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's mostly, it's not so much music, but it's a sound effect.

02:27:55.303 --> 02:27:56.443
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you can hear it in that.

02:27:56.463 --> 02:28:01.486
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually, if it had allowed to play through the intro, it would have sounded different.

02:28:01.626 --> 02:28:01.806
[SPEAKER_08]: Neat.

02:28:01.826 --> 02:28:03.346
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me go to the phones, because we're getting some calls.

02:28:03.667 --> 02:28:04.567
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:28:04.587 --> 02:28:05.007
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

02:28:06.168 --> 02:28:07.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, it's Panaxium.

02:28:07.168 --> 02:28:08.889
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, oh, another video caller.

02:28:08.949 --> 02:28:10.010
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Panaxium?

02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.970
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

02:28:11.250 --> 02:28:12.891
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you can't see me, but I'm waving.

02:28:14.699 --> 02:28:15.139
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

02:28:15.379 --> 02:28:17.040
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, you're a special, special person.

02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:17.780
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:19.020
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:28:19.241 --> 02:28:22.502
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually calling to see if you guys had heard of Starbound.

02:28:23.342 --> 02:28:24.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Starbound.

02:28:24.242 --> 02:28:24.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

02:28:25.463 --> 02:28:27.923
[SPEAKER_08]: This has to be like an Earthbound fan sequel, right?

02:28:28.904 --> 02:28:29.424
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no.

02:28:29.484 --> 02:28:31.265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the spiritual successor to Terraria.

02:28:31.925 --> 02:28:32.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

02:28:32.665 --> 02:28:33.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:28:33.645 --> 02:28:34.426
[SPEAKER_04]: No, tell me about it.

02:28:34.526 --> 02:28:35.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me more.

02:28:36.082 --> 02:28:44.387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually going to be set very sci-fi, so you're going to be able to visit other planets and stuff, and each planet's going to have a different ecosystem and monsters and things like that.

02:28:45.167 --> 02:28:46.908
[SPEAKER_04]: So far it looks like it's going to be really cool.

02:28:46.929 --> 02:28:47.609
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Terraria.

02:28:47.629 --> 02:28:49.090
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys had a chance to try it.

02:28:49.250 --> 02:28:50.050
[SPEAKER_08]: I have tried it.

02:28:50.491 --> 02:28:52.452
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer Minecraft, I've got to say.

02:28:52.812 --> 02:28:56.154
[SPEAKER_08]: Terraria really did not tell me what to do.

02:28:56.954 --> 02:28:58.374
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to get into it and could not.

02:28:58.494 --> 02:29:03.896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I went back and played it after I enjoyed Minecraft and I was like, alright, I see why people get into this.

02:29:03.916 --> 02:29:08.136
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's like, if Minecraft were on the Super Nintendo, this is what it would be.

02:29:09.457 --> 02:29:10.237
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was pretty cool.

02:29:11.397 --> 02:29:12.137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

02:29:12.297 --> 02:29:18.979
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new ones, they have the graphics, they have the variety of things you can get and do and different races you can play as.

02:29:19.079 --> 02:29:20.559
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems really cool.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.181
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it by the same people who did the original Terraria?

02:29:24.201 --> 02:29:25.522
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the same group.

02:29:25.782 --> 02:29:26.783
[SPEAKER_04]: They've expanded it though.

02:29:26.803 --> 02:29:27.923
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more people working on it.

02:29:28.243 --> 02:29:28.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.

02:29:30.204 --> 02:29:34.206
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm glad the first game worked out so well for them that they can actually do a sequel.

02:29:34.246 --> 02:29:34.927
[SPEAKER_08]: That's got to be good.

02:29:36.828 --> 02:29:41.630
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually led me to a question and I thought I'd kind of pass it along to you guys to get your opinion.

02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:42.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

02:29:43.431 --> 02:29:50.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that this will ever move from being an indie type game with like Minecraft and Terraria towards being a big project game?

02:29:52.020 --> 02:29:54.162
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything's possible in this day and age.

02:29:55.043 --> 02:30:02.849
[SPEAKER_08]: You see things like the Gianna Sisters game started as a Project Greenlight thing and now it's an Xbox Live Arcade.

02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:06.292
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose a lot of it is what do the developers want?

02:30:07.053 --> 02:30:08.654
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they kind of willing to do?

02:30:09.315 --> 02:30:10.275
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes people...

02:30:11.036 --> 02:30:15.978
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't really want to play by the rules that systems like Xbox Live and so forth might set out.

02:30:16.598 --> 02:30:23.960
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've all heard the stories before about the patching on Xbox Live and how it costs all this money if you want to do a patch beyond the first one.

02:30:24.340 --> 02:30:25.901
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really turned some people off.

02:30:26.221 --> 02:30:28.001
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't patch Fez because of it, right?

02:30:28.161 --> 02:30:28.941
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's too expensive.

02:30:28.961 --> 02:30:30.522
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole big thing behind it.

02:30:31.022 --> 02:30:34.305
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Nintendo's changing that up a little bit.

02:30:34.345 --> 02:30:35.806
[SPEAKER_08]: We reported on that a couple weeks ago.

02:30:35.866 --> 02:30:38.107
[SPEAKER_08]: We have yet to see the impact of that, if it works.

02:30:38.528 --> 02:30:44.472
[SPEAKER_08]: But Nintendo's really trying to woo the indies towards Wii U by not charging a fee for any of that stuff.

02:30:45.313 --> 02:30:49.156
[SPEAKER_08]: So it could be very interesting to see kind of where they'll end up.

02:30:49.956 --> 02:31:11.358
[SPEAKER_08]: um I guess at the end of the day it just depends I mean do they think they can create the gaming experience they want on those systems I don't know I seem to remember Terraria made pretty good use of the keyboard so maybe they're worried about putting the uh controller into that environment I don't know but um

02:31:13.039 --> 02:31:24.925
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a risk worth taking but they have to decide if financially it's one that they'll get the downloads from but if the community demands it you never know what might happen

02:31:26.124 --> 02:31:26.785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

02:31:26.905 --> 02:31:32.729
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those cooperative collaboration games where you're building and exploring together, those are my kind of game.

02:31:32.749 --> 02:31:37.152
[SPEAKER_04]: I always liked them, so I'm hoping that they get more exposure and more games made in that style.

02:31:37.252 --> 02:31:42.936
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and that's the type of stuff that seems to really do well on Xbox Live Indie games, too, is all the Minecraft clones.

02:31:43.016 --> 02:31:46.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you look at the top games, like, half of them are Minecraft clones.

02:31:46.639 --> 02:31:47.280
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

02:31:48.821 --> 02:31:49.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:31:49.061 --> 02:31:49.141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:31:50.491 --> 02:31:55.134
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what I had called about and just wanted to call in and say hi.

02:31:55.754 --> 02:32:00.297
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hello, and thank you for alerting us to a game we ought to be keeping our eyes on.

02:32:01.077 --> 02:32:03.619
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll go ahead and post the link to their website in the chat.

02:32:03.919 --> 02:32:04.259
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:06.641
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.

02:32:06.681 --> 02:32:07.001
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

02:32:08.742 --> 02:32:15.966
[SPEAKER_08]: Panaxium, everybody, on our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:19.229 --> 02:32:20.890
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking up Link to the Past right now.

02:32:22.010 --> 02:32:23.611
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, no, Link to the Past is the Super Nintendo one.

02:32:23.631 --> 02:32:24.331
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have been different.

02:32:24.351 --> 02:32:25.772
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the Adventures of Link?

02:32:25.792 --> 02:32:27.753
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the second game?

02:32:29.633 --> 02:32:30.454
[SPEAKER_08]: Of Link.

02:32:30.694 --> 02:32:32.135
[SPEAKER_08]: Live radio, boys and girls.

02:32:32.995 --> 02:32:33.375
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

02:32:33.655 --> 02:32:35.316
[SPEAKER_08]: The Adventure of Link title.

02:32:35.856 --> 02:32:36.096
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:32:37.997 --> 02:32:40.518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wow, even the little... That does... That sounds different too.

02:32:40.538 --> 02:32:44.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:32:51.235 --> 02:32:54.176
[SPEAKER_08]: I always knew the Famicom games sounded different.

02:32:54.256 --> 02:33:00.059
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew about this chip and all that stuff, you know, just as, you know, keeping my finger on the gaming community pulse as long as I have been.

02:33:00.079 --> 02:33:00.719
[SPEAKER_08]: You knew about this stuff.

02:33:00.759 --> 02:33:03.281
[SPEAKER_08]: I never really sat down to the time to listen to some of this stuff.

02:33:03.721 --> 02:33:11.204
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

02:33:11.224 --> 02:33:12.945
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

02:33:14.025 --> 02:33:15.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:33:15.066 --> 02:33:15.406
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

02:33:16.186 --> 02:33:17.307
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the one and only Ranma.

02:33:17.707 --> 02:33:19.028
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Ranma, what's up, buddy?

02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:26.464
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want you to know, for the first time in the history of calling this show, you guys have derailed me from what I wanted to talk about.

02:33:27.004 --> 02:33:27.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

02:33:27.864 --> 02:33:28.125
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

02:33:29.245 --> 02:33:29.865
[SPEAKER_05]: Rush Jet 1.

02:33:30.186 --> 02:33:32.147
[SPEAKER_05]: After hearing that music, I went straight to the Googles.

02:33:34.368 --> 02:33:35.389
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty awesome, isn't it?

02:33:36.329 --> 02:33:39.592
[SPEAKER_05]: You have no idea, especially with the fact that I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.

02:33:39.952 --> 02:33:41.653
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be filling this up on my phone tonight.

02:33:42.314 --> 02:33:43.414
[SPEAKER_05]: He's good, too.

02:33:43.574 --> 02:33:44.575
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a lot of stuff.

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:49.519
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a track that I think we have in rotation on VOG, actually.

02:33:50.039 --> 02:33:55.483
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on the old Orange, because I went through the old Orange Lounge Radio files when we were putting together VOG's initial playlist.

02:33:55.503 --> 02:34:00.167
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously we want a mixture of geek stuff as well as the video game stuff in there.

02:34:00.527 --> 02:34:05.371
[SPEAKER_08]: But we actually had, oh shit, now that I'm talking about it, of course I can't find it.

02:34:05.951 --> 02:34:32.397
[SPEAKER_11]: but we actually had in there a track it was called I think it was Kanamized was the name of the song I'm going to see if I can find it while we're talking here I'll play a little clip of it but it was awesome by the way Jason also suggested finding the Hyrule Castle Famicom version from Zelda 2 oh I've heard that one it is phenomenal that's pretty amazing I don't even like Zelda 2 that much but I love the music in it actually Zelda 2 is my favorite one because believe it or not that was the first Zelda game I ever played

02:34:34.353 --> 02:34:35.934
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one for me was the first one.

02:34:36.174 --> 02:34:38.834
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just didn't like the side-scrolling aspect.

02:34:38.874 --> 02:34:41.455
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm not going to whine because it was hard.

02:34:41.755 --> 02:34:43.176
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the game was really freaking hard.

02:34:44.116 --> 02:34:45.536
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was just the style.

02:34:46.156 --> 02:34:47.177
[SPEAKER_11]: It just didn't seem quite right.

02:34:47.197 --> 02:34:49.297
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also looked like Link was stabbing people with his cock.

02:34:51.398 --> 02:34:52.458
[SPEAKER_11]: The downward thrust.

02:34:52.518 --> 02:34:52.958
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

02:34:54.358 --> 02:34:54.778
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

02:34:55.959 --> 02:34:57.759
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in puberty.

02:34:57.839 --> 02:34:58.599
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew what those were.

02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:00.420
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

02:35:01.368 --> 02:35:03.431
[SPEAKER_08]: So what else did you call in to talk about tonight?

02:35:03.471 --> 02:35:04.653
[SPEAKER_08]: Just Rush Jet?

02:35:05.695 --> 02:35:08.138
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was out earlier so I mishapped the show.

02:35:08.219 --> 02:35:08.900
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

02:35:09.721 --> 02:35:10.442
[SPEAKER_05]: Shame on you.

02:35:10.642 --> 02:35:11.043
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

02:35:12.926 --> 02:35:13.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Two quick things.

02:35:14.288 --> 02:35:15.630
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about what's happening to G4?

02:35:17.148 --> 02:35:18.089
[SPEAKER_08]: The Esquire thing?

02:35:18.129 --> 02:35:18.409
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:30.816
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have missed it when we were talking about it, but another podcast, The Nerdist with Chris Hardwick, Alan informed me that they were talking about that it's actually like Brovo is what the network's basically going to be.

02:35:31.116 --> 02:35:35.539
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were coming up with a joke, The Real Dude Bros of Orange County might be a show.

02:35:36.339 --> 02:35:38.200
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like Hipster Spike TV.

02:35:41.862 --> 02:35:42.203
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

02:35:42.323 --> 02:35:46.105
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think the Esquire channel will end up being?

02:35:47.409 --> 02:35:48.230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

02:35:48.250 --> 02:35:50.311
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I want to know.

02:35:50.611 --> 02:35:53.373
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be funny nonetheless to see the end results.

02:35:53.613 --> 02:35:54.614
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the other question.

02:35:54.714 --> 02:35:55.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you care?

02:35:56.635 --> 02:35:57.276
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

02:35:58.176 --> 02:36:00.338
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's that song, by the way, that's in rotation on VOG.

02:36:00.378 --> 02:36:00.798
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it.

02:36:10.543 --> 02:36:10.703
[SPEAKER_08]: MagFest

02:36:38.547 --> 02:36:40.608
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is.

02:36:41.229 --> 02:36:44.490
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this about Mag the game on Sony or no?

02:36:45.291 --> 02:36:48.272
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a four-day gaming convention.

02:36:48.793 --> 02:36:49.113
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:36:49.973 --> 02:36:50.874
[SPEAKER_05]: All types of video games.

02:36:51.034 --> 02:36:52.255
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm checking the guest list.

02:36:52.275 --> 02:36:53.695
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some interesting people here.

02:36:54.356 --> 02:36:59.359
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just say there's somebody here where we may have to ship DarkSakura over to DC for it.

02:36:59.619 --> 02:37:00.079
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

02:37:00.699 --> 02:37:01.720
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's going to pay for the ticket?

02:37:04.087 --> 02:37:04.808
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my ways.

02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:09.154
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what's the talent that's going to be there?

02:37:09.795 --> 02:37:12.619
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a couple of names here we've heard on the show, like John St.

02:37:12.679 --> 02:37:14.141
[SPEAKER_05]: John and Eric Ruth Games.

02:37:14.642 --> 02:37:15.964
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I definitely know John St.

02:37:16.004 --> 02:37:16.264
[SPEAKER_08]: John.

02:37:16.284 --> 02:37:16.604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, yep.

02:37:18.098 --> 02:37:24.840
[SPEAKER_05]: And since you mentioned Castlevania earlier, Kinuyo Yamashita, composer for Castlevania.

02:37:25.961 --> 02:37:26.161
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

02:37:26.761 --> 02:37:26.981
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:37:27.421 --> 02:37:27.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

02:37:28.682 --> 02:37:30.462
[SPEAKER_05]: And can I get a drumroll, please?

02:37:33.563 --> 02:37:34.323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yuzo Koshiro.

02:37:34.764 --> 02:37:37.544
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:37:37.805 --> 02:37:38.085
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

02:37:38.165 --> 02:37:39.905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a huge Yuzo Koshiro fan.

02:37:39.925 --> 02:37:40.725
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

02:37:41.546 --> 02:37:43.486
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have one spot left in our room.

02:37:44.527 --> 02:37:44.947
[SPEAKER_05]: When is it?

02:37:46.124 --> 02:37:47.205
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in line for press.

02:38:06.824 --> 02:38:07.124
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

02:38:07.244 --> 02:38:09.565
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says MagFest is amazing.

02:38:09.965 --> 02:38:11.966
[SPEAKER_08]: Brentalfloss has been there the last few years.

02:38:12.466 --> 02:38:15.407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and they also call this con Drinkfest.

02:38:15.507 --> 02:38:17.127
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I have to explain why.

02:38:18.127 --> 02:38:19.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't imagine why.

02:38:19.128 --> 02:38:22.869
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason why they're walking around with styrofoam containers.

02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:25.189
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully I make it out there for PAX East.

02:38:25.209 --> 02:38:25.830
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

02:38:25.870 --> 02:38:26.530
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still trying.

02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:30.671
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to wait for them to open up the media registration to see if we can make that work.

02:38:32.147 --> 02:38:34.708
[SPEAKER_05]: My entire staff, we got our badges in advance.

02:38:35.209 --> 02:38:36.530
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to apply for press.

02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:41.113
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we get pressed, then we'll just pass the badges on to somebody else or whoever.

02:38:41.933 --> 02:38:42.354
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

02:38:42.654 --> 02:38:43.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Paying it forward.

02:38:44.275 --> 02:38:45.636
[SPEAKER_08]: Got that shit right.

02:38:46.076 --> 02:38:46.536
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, buddy.

02:38:46.556 --> 02:38:47.797
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

02:38:48.558 --> 02:38:49.078
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, man.

02:38:49.138 --> 02:38:49.719
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care, buddy.

02:38:49.839 --> 02:38:50.559
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun at MAGFest.

02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:51.320
[SPEAKER_08]: Will do.

02:38:52.952 --> 02:38:59.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I've basically been told that basically, yes, I am being forced at gunpoint to go to DragonCon next year.

02:38:59.134 --> 02:39:00.355
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's like a thing.

02:39:00.695 --> 02:39:04.216
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been told if you want to go to PAX, you better go to PAX East because you ain't going to PAX Prime.

02:39:05.677 --> 02:39:06.017
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:39:06.417 --> 02:39:06.798
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

02:39:06.818 --> 02:39:12.840
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:19.443
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, if you're in the southeast part of the country, you might want to make plans on DragonCon because there's like a lot of VOG stuff going on at DragonCon next year.

02:39:19.603 --> 02:39:20.463
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I can really say.

02:39:23.689 --> 02:39:30.711
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Launch Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR Loki, I can go to you for last minute stories, but I can also do the Twitter topics.

02:39:31.031 --> 02:39:32.412
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got last minute stories if you want them.

02:39:32.452 --> 02:39:32.972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go for it.

02:39:33.592 --> 02:39:39.314
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to the PlayStation Network probably next week.

02:39:40.294 --> 02:39:47.716
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dated for December 12th in Hong Kong, I believe.

02:39:47.756 --> 02:39:49.177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the English version there.

02:39:49.597 --> 02:39:58.065
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it has been also confirmed on the Drop, which is the PlayStation Blog's little bit where they talk about stuff that's coming out.

02:39:58.646 --> 02:40:01.909
[SPEAKER_06]: And next week, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas PS2 Classic.

02:40:02.109 --> 02:40:05.312
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fantastic that that's going to be coming out.

02:40:06.974 --> 02:40:13.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there's been some Linux system requirements popping up on Steam for some games that haven't really been announced yet.

02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:23.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Serious Sam BFE's Linux requirements have been on there, and also some more of the, I guess, a few Greenlight games as well.

02:40:24.088 --> 02:40:31.073
[SPEAKER_06]: So, perhaps more evidence that they're really working towards that Steam version, or the Linux version of Steam for the Steam box.

02:40:31.093 --> 02:40:31.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

02:40:32.154 --> 02:40:32.754
[SPEAKER_06]: Be interesting.

02:40:32.814 --> 02:40:37.676
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, the next Assassin's Creed is going to be in Brazil.

02:40:38.416 --> 02:40:40.097
[SPEAKER_06]: And this has been actually confirmed.

02:40:40.157 --> 02:40:48.480
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess GameSpot says they verified the translation that the next chapter is supposed to be held in Brazil.

02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:51.421
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was coming from Ubisoft Brazil.

02:40:53.142 --> 02:40:53.762
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine that.

02:40:54.002 --> 02:40:55.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that their next game is going to be there.

02:40:56.143 --> 02:41:00.745
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, it would be perfect for them to be working on it in some capacity.

02:41:02.776 --> 02:41:03.817
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

02:41:03.857 --> 02:41:04.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to some Twitter topics.

02:41:04.958 --> 02:41:05.258
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh.

02:41:05.698 --> 02:41:05.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

02:41:06.138 --> 02:41:07.219
[SPEAKER_08]: One last thing real quick.

02:41:07.399 --> 02:41:10.622
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype.

02:41:10.782 --> 02:41:19.668
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned on my Twitter this week, I am very disappointed to announce that Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable has been canceled in the U.S.

02:41:20.569 --> 02:41:47.238
[SPEAKER_06]: at least the retail release of it now that doesn't rule out that they could be doing a digital only version which would make sense because the Vita not doing so great and a game that's kind of niche like Earth Defense Force may not sell very well as far as releasing at retail DJ Max Technica just came out on Vita this week and it's apparently easier to get on the digital store than it is to get a physical copy yeah so that might be might be why

02:41:48.022 --> 02:41:49.643
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the phones because you have a call coming in.

02:41:49.683 --> 02:41:50.584
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:41:50.604 --> 02:41:50.944
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

02:41:53.946 --> 02:41:55.367
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Ragenator.

02:41:55.567 --> 02:41:56.447
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Ragenator.

02:41:56.528 --> 02:41:57.628
[SPEAKER_08]: And look, another video.

02:41:57.728 --> 02:42:01.311
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that the callers are actually listening to the request for more video.

02:42:01.671 --> 02:42:02.291
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, buddy?

02:42:04.312 --> 02:42:04.993
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much.

02:42:05.873 --> 02:42:10.116
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a couple of questions for you.

02:42:10.536 --> 02:42:10.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

02:42:11.957 --> 02:42:15.279
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I know that Rams...

02:42:17.312 --> 02:42:19.393
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of a legal gray area.

02:42:19.913 --> 02:42:34.197
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that emulators, assuming that you have, let's say, Final Fantasy XII for the PS2, you actually own the game, are you allowed to use an emulator to play the game?

02:42:36.161 --> 02:42:38.944
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:42:52.981 --> 02:42:57.462
[SPEAKER_08]: and you use an emulator to play that backup copy, I believe you're okay.

02:42:58.022 --> 02:43:03.163
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you downloaded said copy from the internet, technically that's where you're in the legal gray area.

02:43:03.583 --> 02:43:07.264
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to end up on Judge Judy and spend time behind bars because of it?

02:43:07.644 --> 02:43:08.984
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

02:43:09.305 --> 02:43:10.285
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

02:43:10.705 --> 02:43:15.426
[SPEAKER_08]: But are you being 100% legal?

02:43:15.946 --> 02:43:18.526
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a law-abiding citizen by every step of the way?

02:43:18.887 --> 02:43:19.947
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

02:43:20.267 --> 02:43:20.527
[SPEAKER_08]: But

02:43:21.327 --> 02:43:34.131
[SPEAKER_08]: I think ethically, if you want to ask kind of the ethical question, if you own the game, then yes, you ought to be able to have the emulator and do whatever crazy things you want to do with the hacking and so forth.

02:43:34.191 --> 02:43:38.452
[SPEAKER_08]: You paid your money to support the developers and get the game and so forth.

02:43:38.792 --> 02:43:39.412
[SPEAKER_08]: Have at you.

02:43:39.472 --> 02:43:40.272
[SPEAKER_08]: Do what you want with it.

02:43:40.453 --> 02:43:41.893
[SPEAKER_08]: I think ethically you're okay.

02:43:42.898 --> 02:43:49.166
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I brought it up because I still have a lot of games on desk.

02:43:49.186 --> 02:43:50.207
[SPEAKER_00]: I got laying around.

02:43:50.267 --> 02:43:53.091
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the things back in August did not scale everything.

02:43:54.032 --> 02:43:57.233
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got my Final Fantasy XII and I've been dying to beat the game

02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:28.383
[SPEAKER_08]: Legally, yeah, but ethically, I think you're okay.

02:44:28.944 --> 02:44:44.235
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just kind of figured, you know, if there was something out there that, you know, programmed it, well, mimicked the hardware, I mean, if I actually popped the disc into my computer's DVD drive, the original disc, you know, basically turned my computer into a PS2, um,

02:44:46.781 --> 02:44:49.202
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't totally sure if it would be legal or not.

02:44:49.242 --> 02:44:51.564
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to get myself into trouble.

02:44:52.264 --> 02:44:53.124
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you'll be fine.

02:44:53.164 --> 02:44:54.265
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody listens to this show.

02:44:54.305 --> 02:44:54.905
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the good news.

02:44:56.446 --> 02:45:03.110
[SPEAKER_08]: On the PlayStation 2, didn't you have that hard drive backup thing where you could load all the games to the drive and play them off the drive and it worked fine?

02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:04.390
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was.

02:45:05.011 --> 02:45:05.431
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not you.

02:45:05.451 --> 02:45:05.711
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

02:45:05.731 --> 02:45:07.092
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Loki, not you, Reginator.

02:45:07.112 --> 02:45:07.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

02:45:07.552 --> 02:45:09.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was the HD loader that they had.

02:45:09.494 --> 02:45:10.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the HD loader.

02:45:10.554 --> 02:45:13.096
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if it's games you own, that's fine.

02:45:13.136 --> 02:45:19.461
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're renting games, dumping them and then shipping them back, that's ethically shame, shame, slap on the wrist.

02:45:19.622 --> 02:45:19.862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:45:19.882 --> 02:45:21.503
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyway, sorry, Reginator.

02:45:22.144 --> 02:45:31.131
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I don't see, at least with what you were just talking about, you know, even then, how many games are going to put onto that PS2 hard drive?

02:45:31.251 --> 02:45:32.852
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only a 60 gigabyte hard drive, or

02:45:37.419 --> 02:45:38.980
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch that out, 40 gigabyte.

02:45:39.701 --> 02:45:46.925
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average, what, PS2 game was about, I'd say no more than 8 gigs.

02:45:47.385 --> 02:45:50.667
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you hack things to get the 500 gig hard drive to work.

02:45:52.008 --> 02:45:53.208
[SPEAKER_08]: Which you can also do on the Wii.

02:45:55.710 --> 02:46:04.175
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I kind of touched on over the past month or two is that now that I don't have any consoles anymore,

02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:22.372
[SPEAKER_00]: any more, thanks to these, I've been getting into PC games, and at least temporarily I've been using games for Windows Live in the marketplace, because I have a pre-existing account through Microsoft when I have my 360.

02:46:25.053 --> 02:46:33.235
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that compared to, say, Xbox Live in their marketplace, there's hardly any

02:46:36.695 --> 02:46:40.208
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of better term, meaty games like, let's say, uh,

02:46:41.397 --> 02:46:49.679
[SPEAKER_00]: The Duels of Planes, Focker's Games, there's no Geometry Wars, no... That's why it failed, sir.

02:46:49.779 --> 02:46:52.099
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it unfortunately has failed.

02:46:52.319 --> 02:47:01.881
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, what you see there is probably all that's going to be there because now it's all about the Windows 8 marketplace is where the future focus is going to be.

02:47:02.401 --> 02:47:06.722
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I think games for Windows is sadly a thing of the past.

02:47:07.022 --> 02:47:09.824
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that being said, right now my computer has Windows 7 Home Premium installed.

02:47:09.844 --> 02:47:11.045
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, would you recommend, based on what you know about

02:47:42.922 --> 02:47:45.264
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't used it, so it's hard for me to say.

02:47:45.404 --> 02:47:48.748
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't say, yes, you should upgrade, but I'm not using it myself.

02:47:49.248 --> 02:47:56.376
[SPEAKER_08]: I will tell you my hesitation is that I want to see how the compatibility looks with Windows 8 and kind of what the complaints are about it.

02:47:56.616 --> 02:47:58.298
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

02:47:59.179 --> 02:48:05.726
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of my friends that are using it, this is kind of the bottom line that I've heard from people that are using it right now.

02:48:06.226 --> 02:48:09.290
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're on something before 7, then upgrade.

02:48:09.870 --> 02:48:16.758
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're on 7, there's a few little perks, but it's not something you gotta get right now.

02:48:17.258 --> 02:48:17.679
[SPEAKER_08]: It can wait.

02:48:19.881 --> 02:48:20.121
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:48:20.241 --> 02:48:20.762
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

02:48:21.002 --> 02:48:21.722
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, RageNator.

02:48:21.903 --> 02:48:23.584
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to let you go so we can wrap things up.

02:48:23.744 --> 02:48:26.326
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you so much for the call, and thank you for the video.

02:48:27.087 --> 02:48:27.687
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, no problem.

02:48:27.747 --> 02:48:28.568
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, take care, buddy.

02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.949
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, bye-bye.

02:48:30.029 --> 02:48:30.329
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

02:48:31.290 --> 02:48:33.032
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:48:34.313 --> 02:48:36.715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to all our callers for calling in.

02:48:36.755 --> 02:48:40.798
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we have the router and that the stream's not dropping, I think we need to get a studio cam back.

02:48:40.838 --> 02:48:42.239
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that might be something we need to do.

02:48:42.719 --> 02:48:44.421
[SPEAKER_08]: That way we can look at the listeners when they're calling.

02:48:45.001 --> 02:48:51.927
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that is not going to do it just yet because I need to get to the Twitter topics, but that is going to do it for the Skype line.

02:48:51.967 --> 02:49:02.094
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't get through, email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Redertainment tweeted us earlier and said, OLR, the Grammys ended with an award.

02:49:02.635 --> 02:49:04.236
[SPEAKER_08]: The Emmys ended with an award.

02:49:04.556 --> 02:49:06.258
[SPEAKER_08]: The Oscars ended an award.

02:49:06.958 --> 02:49:10.941
[SPEAKER_08]: The VGAs ended with Tenacious D. What the fuck?

02:49:12.222 --> 02:49:13.083
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that's a good ending.

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:16.425
[SPEAKER_08]: Unpopular opinion time.

02:49:17.445 --> 02:49:19.346
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Tenacious D is super overrated.

02:49:19.926 --> 02:49:20.727
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they're that good.

02:49:22.467 --> 02:49:23.788
[SPEAKER_08]: I caused Jamie to choke.

02:49:23.848 --> 02:49:24.428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

02:49:24.808 --> 02:49:26.249
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the latke caused me to choke.

02:49:26.709 --> 02:49:27.950
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's unpopular opinion.

02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:29.010
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get hate mail.

02:49:29.331 --> 02:49:33.032
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, when you reheat the latkes, do it on the stove.

02:49:36.074 --> 02:49:36.674
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor Jamie.

02:49:36.954 --> 02:49:37.574
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you give me all right?

02:49:37.594 --> 02:49:39.135
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you need water?

02:49:39.155 --> 02:49:41.136
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:49:41.196 --> 02:49:41.436
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:49:43.405 --> 02:49:47.075
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need an ambulance to interrupt an episode of Orange Lounge Radio either.

02:49:47.155 --> 02:49:48.238
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't had evacuation.

02:49:48.258 --> 02:49:50.564
[SPEAKER_08]: She's putting the hack in Hanukkah.

02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:58.252
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw sent us a story lead here.

02:49:58.792 --> 02:50:03.435
[SPEAKER_08]: Bronies shut down their My Little Pony MMO, blaming copyright law.

02:50:05.357 --> 02:50:08.179
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what got shut down today, actually?

02:50:08.259 --> 02:50:08.459
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:13.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the largest indexers for Usenet.

02:50:14.303 --> 02:50:16.084
[SPEAKER_08]: People still use Usenet?

02:50:16.985 --> 02:50:19.007
[SPEAKER_08]: For any legitimate purpose whatsoever?

02:50:19.027 --> 02:50:19.107
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:50:19.867 --> 02:50:21.868
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

02:50:22.168 --> 02:50:23.748
[SPEAKER_08]: Hence why those sites are getting shut down.

02:50:24.369 --> 02:50:25.449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's legit.

02:50:25.589 --> 02:50:28.410
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when Usenet was actually a chap for them.

02:50:28.430 --> 02:50:28.650
[SPEAKER_06]: It's legit.

02:50:28.770 --> 02:50:31.711
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's totally not pirated stuff on there.

02:50:32.451 --> 02:50:38.053
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, NZB Matrix and Newsbin 2 got shut down.

02:50:39.813 --> 02:50:42.075
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so back to the brony story.

02:50:42.496 --> 02:50:48.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Some brony developers were putting together My Little Pony Online, but a cease and desist came in from Hasbro.

02:50:49.483 --> 02:50:50.684
[SPEAKER_08]: But they pressed ahead.

02:50:51.124 --> 02:50:57.050
[SPEAKER_08]: They said, screw it, and they moved forward, and they released the game's first episode a month ago.

02:50:57.731 --> 02:51:03.873
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Hasbro's lawyers sent down a shutdown demand to HLP Online.

02:51:04.593 --> 02:51:10.454
[SPEAKER_08]: The team put out a statement, it's very carefully worded, not blaming Hasbro through the shutdown.

02:51:10.934 --> 02:51:14.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, Hasbro is not to be blamed here, they wrote.

02:51:14.735 --> 02:51:16.676
[SPEAKER_08]: As per US trademark law...

02:51:17.256 --> 02:51:22.057
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as an infringement comes to light, they are obligated to defend the trademark or they will lose it.

02:51:22.397 --> 02:51:27.338
[SPEAKER_08]: They had no choice in the matter, regardless of what they thought the project or how it benefited them.

02:51:27.758 --> 02:51:29.858
[SPEAKER_08]: There was little we could do to work around it.

02:51:30.158 --> 02:51:33.159
[SPEAKER_08]: Discussions continued through the month, but it came down to one fact.

02:51:33.679 --> 02:51:35.900
[SPEAKER_08]: MLP Online had to come to an end.

02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:38.900
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's that whole... You know, we've heard this a couple times this year.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.021
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the whole gamer thing.

02:51:41.381 --> 02:51:42.881
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when Reddit got sued or...

02:51:43.681 --> 02:51:51.886
[SPEAKER_08]: Not sued yet, but the cease and desist went to Reddit over the gamer thing, where gamer.org had it, and then they said that Reddit had to stop using it.

02:51:51.906 --> 02:51:57.030
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's really been resolved yet, but the guy was like, hey, I have a trademark, and I have to protect it.

02:51:57.430 --> 02:52:00.852
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people are like, why were you given that trademark in the first place?

02:52:01.613 --> 02:52:07.316
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is a little different, because we can all understand why Hasbro has a trademark on My Little Pony, but...

02:52:10.098 --> 02:52:18.805
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma in chat, I know one of our resident bronies, says, I'm surprised that Hasbro sent a CND due to all the episodes floating around on YouTube.

02:52:20.246 --> 02:52:23.828
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if Hasbro gets the magic button, those will all disappear real fast.

02:52:24.029 --> 02:52:25.690
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people just talking about it.

02:52:27.771 --> 02:52:30.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there Watch Me Get High and Watch My Little Pony videos on YouTube?

02:52:31.294 --> 02:52:32.535
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, reaction videos?

02:52:32.635 --> 02:52:33.596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are.

02:52:35.034 --> 02:52:35.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.

02:52:36.996 --> 02:52:38.497
[SPEAKER_08]: Never choke on a latke, people.

02:52:39.117 --> 02:52:44.742
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw tweets us to an article about Time's List of the Year, Gadget of the Year.

02:52:45.122 --> 02:52:47.043
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii U, second place.

02:52:47.784 --> 02:52:49.485
[SPEAKER_08]: First place for Gadget of the Year.

02:52:50.166 --> 02:52:51.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you're going to love this.

02:52:51.867 --> 02:52:52.568
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone 5.

02:52:53.749 --> 02:52:55.170
[SPEAKER_08]: Time's Gadget of the Year.

02:52:59.071 --> 02:53:00.453
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are tweets from Tigerclaw.

02:53:00.914 --> 02:53:13.010
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, from SSJ100 Matt, people say LEGO City Undercover is like LEGO Grand Theft Auto, but someone made a LEGO version of the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer, and he links us to it.

02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.550
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen this?

02:53:13.570 --> 02:53:13.931
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it, yeah.

02:53:13.951 --> 02:53:14.512
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think?

02:53:15.272 --> 02:53:16.473
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:53:34.921 --> 02:53:49.369
[SPEAKER_06]: same fucking HUD same like everything as Grand Theft Auto so I wouldn't be surprised at one time that that was the thing that Rockstar was working on with them but now it's you know Traveler Tales or whatever whoever's putting it I think it's Traveler Tales when is that coming out?

02:53:49.989 --> 02:53:54.592
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they have it it's supposed to be launch window so in the next three months could be anything

02:53:55.663 --> 02:54:00.828
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, I mean, seriously, was it Wii Fit U now is the first half of next year instead of Launch Window?

02:54:01.408 --> 02:54:03.230
[SPEAKER_06]: And the rest of this is all March.

02:54:03.290 --> 02:54:05.952
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that is right there.

02:54:06.272 --> 02:54:14.180
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been probably the only like if I were to pick up a Wii U, that would be the game I'd probably get is that Lego City Undercover because it actually looks pretty awesome.

02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:19.144
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's really the only game that's been kind of impressive to me is just that one.

02:54:23.437 --> 02:54:24.097
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry for the dead air.

02:54:24.117 --> 02:54:25.258
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just catching up on chat there.

02:54:26.379 --> 02:54:27.499
[SPEAKER_08]: That is actually going to do it.

02:54:27.519 --> 02:54:28.620
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it for Twitter topics.

02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:30.360
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you were done with last-minute stories, right?

02:54:30.921 --> 02:54:31.561
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe I am.

02:54:31.641 --> 02:54:35.223
[SPEAKER_08]: So that brings us to a close of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:54:35.703 --> 02:54:37.284
[SPEAKER_08]: Sad.

02:54:37.504 --> 02:54:42.286
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we close up shop tonight.

02:54:42.906 --> 02:54:44.607
[SPEAKER_08]: And my final thought, I'll start tonight.

02:54:44.647 --> 02:54:47.529
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is F you to jelly beans.

02:54:47.589 --> 02:54:48.389
[SPEAKER_08]: They're addicting too.

02:54:49.410 --> 02:54:50.750
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

02:54:51.951 --> 02:54:52.371
[SPEAKER_08]: Latkes.

02:54:53.351 --> 02:55:14.097
[SPEAKER_06]: and Loki, your final thought tonight check out the VOG Minecraft server if you haven't yet there's information in our forums on how to sign up basically just say hey I want to sign up put your username on there and I add you to the whitelist because now we have mob arena, it's kind of fun just to battle monsters and it's really fucking hard so

02:55:14.997 --> 02:55:15.418
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

02:55:45.817 --> 02:55:51.419
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some usable classes because we're still tweaking the classes because some of them don't make any sense or don't work right.

02:55:53.199 --> 02:55:58.400
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I'm done tweaking that and the waves and stuff like that because we had a problem at one time where it was just creepers spawning.

02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:07.302
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just tons of fucking creepers and literally you would see you'd be watching up top and they have different waves.

02:56:07.322 --> 02:56:12.704
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one called a swarm wave and all the creatures spawn one heart worth of health but it's a ton of them.

02:56:12.764 --> 02:56:13.984
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of a sudden we saw like

02:56:14.805 --> 02:56:16.927
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 creepers just spawned.

02:56:17.348 --> 02:56:20.952
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, holy shit, there's a huge wave of creepers chasing after me.

02:56:21.493 --> 02:56:22.054
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was kind of fun.

02:56:25.404 --> 02:56:28.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackwolf says we also need a Forza Horizon night.

02:56:28.106 --> 02:56:28.766
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be down for that.

02:56:28.806 --> 02:56:34.190
[SPEAKER_08]: That's on my queue for game rental games, so I need to send Silent Hill back because I'm probably not going to play much more of it.

02:56:34.330 --> 02:56:37.553
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to use a game for my steering wheel.

02:56:37.833 --> 02:56:39.034
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fun to mess around with.

02:56:39.054 --> 02:56:41.236
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what game I have sitting here waiting to play?

02:56:41.276 --> 02:56:44.058
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get around to it for this week, but for next week on the PS3.

02:56:44.158 --> 02:56:44.238
[SPEAKER_08]: XCOM.

02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:55.128
[SPEAKER_08]: I have from the rental guys waiting to play, so I'm excited to check that out.

02:56:55.288 --> 02:57:02.715
[SPEAKER_08]: I was spending Thanksgiving with Spike from Game Buoy, if any of you listen to that show, which if you don't, you should.

02:57:02.815 --> 02:57:04.416
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a fun duo there.

02:57:04.857 --> 02:57:09.361
[SPEAKER_08]: But Spike was showing me XCOM on PC, and I played like a round of it, and it was fun.

02:57:10.181 --> 02:57:10.362
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

02:57:12.386 --> 02:57:12.826
[SPEAKER_08]: My mouse died.

02:57:33.587 --> 02:57:34.148
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it sucks.

02:57:34.208 --> 02:57:34.468
