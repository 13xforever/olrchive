Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, December 9th, 2012, the Wii U is set to get a Google App, Nintendo blocks mature content during the day in one region, and could Idolmaster finally see a localized release?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 485 of our show for this December 9th, 2012.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and gaming lulls with my co-hosts. Say hello first up to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Latke

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
How are you doing?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Latke

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
A lot of latkes

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, we still have some left. I can make more.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Yum, yum, yum. DarkSakura was in the kitchen before the show tonight, and no, that's not a sexist joke. She was

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I volunteered

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Yes, she was cooking up some latkes for the holiday season, because it is Hanukkah.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Yup, it's the second night of Hanukkah.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Even though I am not Jewish myself, who am I to turn down food?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Right, and I give everybody Hanukkah presents.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
And I say Mazel Tov! It was delicious.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I knew that Rob loves coffee, so I gave him and Allen a bunch of coffee.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Allen loves coffee too, that's important.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Well, I was like, what would they both like, so I got them crap tons of Keurig stuff.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Good times.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
And I got, um, our other person in the room, um, gift cards.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Who I should introduce.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Including a Burger King gift card.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yes, and thank you for that.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
You're welcome.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm Jew by proxy, so.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, and I give everyone Hanukkah cards.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
That's true.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
You, you, okay, DarkSakura converted to Judaism, you know.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Uh, Loki married a Jew. Well, I don't, what's my connection? I have friends that are Jewish.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
The last girl I ever knew was Jewish.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
You know John.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
There you go, John. I lived with John.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
He's kind, he's not really Jewish.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I know he's not.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
No, that's why I call him kind of Jewie.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You know.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
I actually, and I really, I really do mean it, you know, I like all sorts of people that I've met in my life.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
And you like their food.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I've met, like, I don't think I've ever met a Jewish person I didn't like really truly like.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Honestly, so.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Well, you know, we're also about to-

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Now everybody's going to be like, oh, that's a challenge.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Let me introduce you to the worst person I know.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
You know what?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
We're now about two weeks away from the Alpacalypse.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, yes. The whole Mayan calendar.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
No, the Alpacalypse. When the wooly, long-necked creatures of the world will come and trample us all.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Is that a Weird Al song?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
No.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Oh.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
It should be.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Instead of-

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I thought that was his album, was Alpacalypse.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Well, yeah, but no, it was Alpocalypse.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
But no, there's a thing like where they're showing pictures of Alpacas and they're saying so many days to the Alpacalypse.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I've been laughing, so I want to have an Alpaca party.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
You know, all I have to say is that how many times have they predicted the end of the world and it didn't happen?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So this is just one more to put in there.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I know.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
When NASA has to come out and say, stop being depressed, the world is not going to end.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Your move next, world.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
Anyhow, how are you, Techmaster Loki, in non-Armageddon news?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Good.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
I've been constantly entering stuff on that steamgifts.com and obviously not winning anything.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Wait, what is this?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Steamgifts.com is basically a site you sign up for.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
What happens is people give away steam codes on there.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
So you enter raffles.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
And so every time that someone puts a code up there, you get 5% of the points that that code's worth.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
So each dollar, say it's a $5 code, it's, you know, 5 points.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You would get 1 point in your account.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
So, like, I went in there earlier and I had 180-some.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And so I kept, you know, enter to win, enter to win all these things.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
And then you come back a few days later, oh, he got more points.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
And so you just keep entering stuff in there and you can, you know, put your own stuff up there if you want.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
And then that'll give you contributing dollars in which you can go to certain ones they have locked out.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Okay, you have to have contributed $5 worth of steam codes to enter this drawing.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And it's a little easier to win because it's going to be more exclusive.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
So you just do that.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
But since it's free, I figured why not?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
And you might win something, or in this case, not.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
You might win spam, email, filling your box.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
We always have the ever-present fourth guest on our show at the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
Because we do tape live, as we have for the past, coming up on 11 years every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
That's vognetwork.com.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, each and every single Sunday night.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
And actdeft in our chat room tonight says steamgifts.com, where nobody ever wins anything.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, somebody does. It's just, it's very rare.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
But better chances in the lottery.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Actdeft does follow that up with, I only won one game in like a thousand entries.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Well, that was, that was one game.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Still better odds in the lottery.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Better than Loki's done out of that, apparently.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Haven't aired a thousand times yet, but.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Rob, I want to promote something.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
What? Sure.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I told you about it earlier. My new Tumblr.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Sure. Why not?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Just because I want, I want people to give me suggestions.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
My Tumblr is massaffecting.tumblr.com.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
And I'm doing this series called Lowell Effect, where I'm doing just all captions on Mass Effect screencaps.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
And I want people to participate.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
If you think of a good one, make it and send it to me, and I will post it.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Do you think maybe everybody's burned out on that by now?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
No. No. No.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Cause you talk about it every week.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Cause that's the, that's what I'm getting on Twitter right now.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
No.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Is I need to shut up about the series.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
No.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Because I'm ruining it by talking about it so much.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
No.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Why not?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
No.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Garris.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
All right.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Again, live.vognetwork.com.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
What I wanted to talk about tonight was the VGAs.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Which, of course, happened on Friday night.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
And I don't think any of us watched.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, that's not true, Jamie.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
You saw bits and pieces of it, it sounds like.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, I was, okay.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I saw this gifset go, I wasn't gonna watch it all.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And then I saw this gifset go up on my Tumblr feed.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
That was all, like, broshep and femshep playing multiplayer with Garris.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
And I was like, okay, that's funny.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And so I found that the whole VGAs were streamed.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So I went looking through the stream to try to find it.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
And I ended up watching bits and pieces of it.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Like, the Halo 4 thing was pretty funny.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And then I found the Mass Effect thing and I stopped caring about everything else.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I did watch the Claptrap one. It was pretty funny.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
It was the little blips for, you know, best character of the year.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
The Claptrap one was funny, I must admit.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
But, no.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Shepherd was robbed, both of them.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm not gonna try to talk about or evaluate a show I didn't watch.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
But just listening to Bobby, because he is before us, you know, every night, every Sunday night at VOG Network.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
He was kind of talking about that it did seem like this year there was more stuff about the games.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
There was less of the skits and kind of the, I guess for lack of a better term, dick and fart jokes.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And it did seem to be a little more about the games.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
And certainly it's interesting that Walking Dead won.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I mean, you know, I'm not saying anything bad about the game.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I haven't played it, so I know no good or bad.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
But I know a lot of people really love it.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
And it has nothing to do with the OMG Zombies part of it, but just I guess the storytelling in the game is so good.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And you had another game that was kind of similar in some ways, Journey.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Which is one of those kind of very difficult to explain to somebody why it's so good.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
But it's that whole, like, emotional connection.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
So it's like, and Journey probably won, what, the second most awards besides Walking Dead.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So Emotion really seemed to connect with the audience this year.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
The big bro games, like, what would be the bro games?

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
Halo 4, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, to some extent even Mass Effect, Jamie.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
None of those games really got the same type of recognition this year.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Best RPG, hello!

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
That could be somewhat of a, I mean, I don't know, what does it mean?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I mean, at the end of the day, what do the VGAs really mean anyway?

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
But I guess you could say it is some of the critics and respected people in the industry coming together to make this decision.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
So, you know, it's a little more than one site because it's kind of a collective.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
Does the choice of the awards this year and the way it's all presented mean that they're taking this more seriously?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Any thoughts? No?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm yelling at Dan in chat room. Dan is in chat.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I just think that they need to have Samuel Jackson hosted each year because he's pretty funny.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, they've been doing that.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Well, he's only hosted four times out of ten years, so, you know.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
But it's like the last four years, hasn't it?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
In the best four years.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
I did like him replacing Cortana and yelling at the people. I'm like,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Cortana should have yelled at them. That was awesome.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And then I was like, oh, wait, Garrus.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Who ended up beating Jennifer Hale for the voice?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't know. I didn't care.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I know. It looked from, oh, somebody from Walking Dead.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Again, I can't evaluate a game I have not played, so I have nothing good nor bad, but I hear a lot of good things.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And I will play it before the end of the year.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Mark Meer wasn't nominated, was he?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
He wasn't even nominated, no.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, because he wasn't all that great.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
But...

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Okay, I will...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
He's fine.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
You know what? He got better the more he did it.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Like practice.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
But Jennifer Hale...

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
She was dead on from the start.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
It's not even just femshep. I'm just talking about her as an actress and all the crap she's done.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
She's great.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
And her Carol Danvers makes me a little, you know, warm.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
There you go. Thank you.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
The chatters filling in the gap there.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
It was Clementine from the Walking Dead, Melissa Hutchinson.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
And I understand...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah, she's not bad.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't even...

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Again, I haven't played the game, but I recognize that name as one that people talk a lot about on Twitter.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So I can clearly see that, okay, you know.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
And I say, you know what, Dark Sakura?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Let Clementine have her moment in the sun.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Mass Effect, they're on their third game.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
And it's had its recognition in the past.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Let Clementine have her moment.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I do have to say that I love that...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And not just as a Garrus fangirl.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
But I do like that Garrus was up there, you know, playing multiplayer with them during the little thing.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, the little skit.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It was hilarious.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I was like, yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
So...

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Alright.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
If it had to be anybody, it must be Garrus.

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
And just so you know, the best human male voice was Damian Clark from Borderlands 2 or Handsome Jack.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
That's awesome.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, that's the little bits and pieces I've heard.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Doesn't the male award seem to go to villains more often than heroes?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Oh my god, Mark Hamill, thank you.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Win the award for the Joker last year.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Mark Hamill's awesome.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
But that was also the last time he's voicing the Joker ever.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Unless you give him more money.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I doubt it.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Well, you think about people having to do a voice like that that's so different from their regular voice.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
It's gonna actually take a physical toll on someone.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
They're gonna have to do another Arkham game at some point, though.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
So it'll be interesting to see how they frame it, you know?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Alright.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Anything else on the VGAs anyone wishes to comment on?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
You need to watch that clip, it was hilarious.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I'll take a look at some point.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Or Lands 2.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
And if anybody wants to see it, it's on my tumblr, mass effecting dot tumblr dot com.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Plug, plug, cheap plug.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Well no, the reason is because Viacom blocked it on YouTube.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Gunstar in our chat room, who could that be?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
That's Dan.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
No doubt commenting on the awards I was just talking about says,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Well put.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Although, my hubby is awesome because he said Garrus does sound like a boss though.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
His voice actor is kind of a goofy looking guy and if you ever watched the episode of Buffy he was in,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
his awesome voice does not suit his face.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
It is kind of nice when your significant other will make a concession towards your fandom, isn't it?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yes.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
If he, you know.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Has Nelly ever made any concessions towards your fandoms, Loki?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
No, we had a discussion today about like,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm like, so what exactly, you know, what do you think?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm like, I don't know, garbage.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
It's like, my point exactly.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
And then in the case of Alan and I, we really do like a lot of the same stuff.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
I mean, he's way more into Half-Life than I am, but I don't like dislike it at all.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
When I played it, it was, you know, the little bits I have played, I've enjoyed.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
I just haven't sat down and played the whole thing, so we don't really have that same conflict.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I'm sure there's something, there's something I'm not thinking of.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
He's, you know what, my Rocky Horror thing and my cult movie thing,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
he's been a good sport about coming out to see those and support that, so.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
It's always nice when your significant other will buy into fandoms and so forth.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Alright, I guess let's get into our gaming weeks

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
and the types of games we have been playing this week.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Raginator in chat says,

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
What are the odds of Mass Effect and Garrus winning every award if Dark Sakura hosted an award show?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Shut up, don't judge me.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Don't judge me.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
This is why we don't host one.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Don't judge me.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
We should do a fun year-end show again this year though, but anyway.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Mass Effect all the things.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
No, no.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
And pumpkin.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
No. I don't even, will Mass Effect 3 win our game of the year? Question mark, question mark.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
It may not. I still have some games I need to play.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Mass Effect all the things.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, tell us about your gaming week as if I need to ask.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I played Mass Effect 3.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And Faerie Solitaire.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
God, that game is awful. I love it.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
But for the past three weeks in a row, you've talked about your Faerie Solitaire.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
You keep saying it's awful, but it's clearly not.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
It's stupidly addicting. It's like playing on, remember back in the day when Neopets was big?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Now that was awful.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah, but you remember the stupid card games on Neopets?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And they were like kind of addicting?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Is Neopets still around? They have to be still around.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I'll check. I wonder if I still have my damn account.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Didn't they sell Neopets shit at Claire's for some time?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yes, they did.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh my god. Did you ever walk into a Claire's just to buy Neopets stuff? Be honest.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Someone that we both know has.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Who hosts another show.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Oh, okay, okay. Interesting.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I'm a witness to this.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
You know what? I can't judge. I can't judge.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
I can judge.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
People have bought World of Warcraft cards. I can't judge.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Someone bought a Mass Effect 2 deck of cards.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And, wow.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
You?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Yes.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And, wow. Lo and behold, the Joker card was Joker.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Everybody has their thing.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
No, I have not turned into a My Little Pony fan because there is nothing that is awesome as the old one.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
The old one kicked ass. The new one is stupid.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Alright, so.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm judging you all.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Anything else for your week besides Mass Effect and Harry Solitaire?

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
I watched Dan play, I'm sorry, Sega Racing Classic.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
And he put it in karaoke mode and started singing Let's Fry Sky High.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
I saw the pictures on his Facebook, and maybe I shouldn't be talking about your husband's Facebook on my radio show, but oops.

15:39.000 --> 15:47.000
Of somebody, either a friend of the family or somebody in your family, sitting in the little cart playing Daytona USA.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
What was that all about?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Sega. That was Dan's cousin's daughter.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Okay. Well, I mean, you didn't have to tell me who. I'm just like, what was the whole?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
It's Sophie. She's cute.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
What was the whole occasion?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I don't know. I wasn't there.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Oh.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I was hanging with Becky that night.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
I assumed you were. My bad.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I was out on a booze buying spree.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Lots of Bailey's and Hypnotic and Kahlua and Sake.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
And then Becky dyed my hair, and then we made fun of people.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
It looked like a nice setup.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Actually, Becky dyed my hair and played Mass Effect 2.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Which Xbox Mass Effect 2.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
It is not that bad. Don't listen to her.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
It's fine.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
The film grain is awful.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
That's the problem.

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, but she turned it off and either, like, either her TV's contrast is up too high or the textures are just really bad.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Don't listen to her. It's fine.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
All right, Loki.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Girl.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Tell us about a different game.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
I played Far Cry 3 this week. Actually, a little bit more in the campaign.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And it's fantastic.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I was hunting dingos last night.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
There will be no baby eating in my watch.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
And let's see. What else did I do?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I played a bit of Minecraft this week.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
I've been working on getting the VoG network arena, the mob arena, done.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And it is working right now.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
The classes are still kind of a work in progress.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm still balancing things because it's fucking hard, okay?

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
Even with just a few people, we've only managed to get to wave 20 out of 100.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
And I had to scale down.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
The first boss is a chicken.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
It's actually a pretty retarded chicken because it fires fireballs.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
But I'd say about 95% of the fireballs it actually fires hit itself.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
And so if you just, like, stand back for a while, it'll eventually kill itself.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Which is kind of funny, but before it had way too much health.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Because you can set the health to different levels.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
And I had it set to psycho health because it's a chicken, you know, whatever.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It doesn't have a lot of health.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I didn't realize, though, the way it calculates it.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
It's like the minimum health is like 100 or something.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
And then it's, you know, time plus, you know, what was it?

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
The number of players plus one times 40 for psychos.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
So this thing had like 16,000 hearts of health.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
So we were literally beating it with a stick for, I'd say, 20 minutes.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And it still wasn't dead.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
And it was just like, okay, I think this is a little too powerful.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So I had to tweak all that stuff.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
But we have a bunch of cool classes in there.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
My friend wanted me to make a pimp class, so I made a pimp class.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
So you have a pimp stick that you can beat things with.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
You have your variety of hoes that you can use that have different abilities.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You know, because the game has hoes in it.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
And what else?

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
There's a wolf master that you have wolves that attack things.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
And I have a miner class.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
And there's a class that's, you know, like a golem class that you can build iron golems with.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
Although, no wait, I had that class, but then the iron golems did no damage to anything.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So I had to remove that.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Ninjas, you know, lots of fun stuff.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
But it gets hard.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I mean, it's just, it's insanely hard.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
But it's kind of fun.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
So I'm still balancing that stuff.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Probably working on that a little bit this week.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
But some good times, though, so far.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
And hitstunninchat at live.vognetwork.com wants to know,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
are we getting world edit back?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, sorry, I've been messing with the permissions stuff.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Yeah, you will have world edit back soon.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
As soon as I fix that.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
Because I took everything out to figure out why the mob arena wasn't working.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
And in the process I kind of removed some of the permissions thing.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I may put it back in the permissions bucket the way I had it before.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Because B permissions is kind of weird.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
So I'll eventually fix that again.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Alright.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And then Call of Duty.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Just Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2, a little bit of each.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Mostly Modern Warfare 3.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
Because we were supposed to be getting copies to do LAN stuff with.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
But those never came from Activision.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
And at this point I don't think they are coming.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
So I'm not buying copies for everybody.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
So fuck that.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
So I'll play it with my friend.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
And I think that's all I've played this week.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Wait, no, there's one other thing.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
What the hell did I play this week?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
There's one other game I played.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Nah, it's probably not important.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
My gaming week, as I've talked about before on the show.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
I did pre-order the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
And it came...

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Whatever. You'd buy it too if you...

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
Actually, no. With the reasons that... I'll let you finish.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Well, here's the thing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I got the game and it's fine.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
But it was a little... I'm doing my playthrough again.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I haven't done a complete playthrough of the Mass Effect series.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I know I've talked about the game a lot.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
And it's because I really enjoy the multiplayer.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It's kind of what's been keeping me afloat.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
This is the first time I've really sat down to replay the entire series.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
So I'm doing it this time as Renegade.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It's the first time I did it at Paragon.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
And already I'm just seeing such differences in the story.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
But I'm playing through the first game.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm playing it on PlayStation.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And if you guys didn't know, this is the first time

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
the original Mass Effect has been on the PlayStation 3.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
This is the first time. And what? The game's five years old.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Because Microsoft had an exclusive on it for however many years.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
So they're just now bringing it out.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
So with all this time to release it and get it right,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
you'd think it would be bug-free.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
But unfortunately that wasn't the case.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
I've been running into quite a few bugs that are not fun.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Well, they're not game-breaking.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
So I can't complain too much.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
But characters facing the wrong way in dialogue scenes.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Just weird.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Complete parts skipping.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
But when I load my game in place...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
So they're facing the wrong direction?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I have to ask you a question!

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Yeah, facing the complete wrong way.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I only had one thing ever like that happen on the PC version

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
for Mass Effect 3.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
And that's when you're talking to Liara and Glyph is in the room.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
And if Shepard looks at Glyph,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
then she doesn't look back at Liara at all.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
But that's only for that one conversation.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Now, Shane's been telling me though that he's been playing the trilogy

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
because they got it too and that he's fine.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
They haven't seen any of the problems I've been complaining about.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
So, I don't know.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Maybe it's because I was downloading the Ni No Kuni demo

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
in the background while I was playing Mass Effect.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Which, by the way, I didn't get to that demo yet.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Sorry, don't ask me because I haven't played it yet.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
But yeah, I played a little bit of that.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Besides the bugs, the game itself is still great,

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
but I would still say the best version is either going to be 360 or PC

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
depending on if you're a console or PC.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Actually, for the first game, the PC is the superior version.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It really is.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Because they made the hacking thing is much better

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
and just the Mako stuff is not as frustrating.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
No, no, no. First game, all the Medi-Gel.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Not the Medi-Gel, the Omni-Gel all the time.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Or whatever that stuff was.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Let's see, other games I've been playing.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
I got from my rental service, Silent Hill Book of Memories on the PSP.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
So, I was checking that out a little bit.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I haven't really gotten much further than the original demo,

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
so I can't really say anything in addition to the demo I've already played.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
So...

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
But I don't hate it.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
But it isn't really Silent Hill either.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Somebody slapped Silent Hill on a dungeon crawler game.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
That's what it is.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Oh, I was going to say, yeah. See, that was the thing.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I was like, oh, maybe I'll try this and stuff.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
And then I looked at the back of the box and it had the screenshots.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I'm like, what is a top-down third-person game?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Nope.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I like Alan's comment.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Mass Effect 3 still has the exorcism neck bug, which is hilarious.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Trainer gets it a lot.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah, it's like they're looking completely over their shoulder.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I get it the most with Javik.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Let me put it this way.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
When I played the series on 360, I don't remember ever seeing a bug

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
until the Omega DLC.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Omega DLC was the first time I saw bugs in the 360 version.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
So just put it out there.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh, by the way, just in case you're curious,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 1 is based off the 360 version,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
not the PC version.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
The hacking game is the whole button-pushing thing,

24:16.000 --> 24:25.000
not the arrow through the circular lock thing that the PC has.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
So...

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Interesting.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
We've talked enough about that game here on this program,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
so I'm just putting it out there,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
that I do have the trilogy on PlayStation,

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
and it's just called Being a Fan and Buying All the Things.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
You know what?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
What?

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
The problem is, okay, you know I started off playing it on 360

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
and it hurt my hand.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
I'm not going to go get another version of a game I've already got on PC

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
when I love my PC version and I can make my Shepard blue.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Just saying.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I was curious about some of the differences,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
and especially multiplayer on 3, I wanted to have on the PlayStation controller.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Research for the show, Rob.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yes, research for the show.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
And it's not like I'm going to get a free copy, so might as well.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Might as well.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
All right, that's it for our gaming week.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
So we'll get into gaming news after I mention housekeeping,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
twitter.com slash o-l-r, and of course our Facebook,

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And Dark Soccer's yelling from the kitchen,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I'll have to make another pector and break.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
I grabbed one earlier.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
They're so good.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
They're not good for you.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Why do we keep eating them?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Potatoes and potassium.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Then Alan's going to get home and be like,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
you spoiled dinner.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
I'm going to make him a whole big thing of them, okay?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
All right.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Loki.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
All right, so there is another game that's receiving a nomination for Grammy.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
That wonderful game would be Journey.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
And the soundtrack of the game is, I guess,

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
nominated for best score soundtrack for visual media.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
And I guess the nominees so far, Journey,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
The Adventures of Tin Tin, The Artist,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Dark Knight Rises, and let's see,

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
So that would be pretty cool if it won.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
I mean, the soundtrack in the game was pretty awesome.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
And you may remember, of course, Civ IV won that award, I guess,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
was that last year?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah, it was last year.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
That was an interesting scenario.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I mean, that song's great.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Love Baba Yetu.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
I mean, who doesn't?

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
And that's not just my Civ IV fandom coming into play.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
I really do love that song.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
But that was a weird situation because even though, yes,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
it was the song from the video game,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
it wasn't until he put it on his album,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
because he had that whole album that he did,

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
and then that was nominated for the award from the album.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
So that's why Civ IV came out in, what, 2008, question mark?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
No, earlier than that.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
God, Civ IV was probably like 06 or 07.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
10 was Civ IV, the console version, so I don't know.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Yeah, no, it was a ways before that.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
I want to say Civ IV was what they were pimping at my first or second E3.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
So it was a while ago that Civ IV came out.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
And, yeah, so it took a little while.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
And I'm not belittling that achievement by any means.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
That's an amazing thing, the amazing piece of work by Christopher Ten,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
and so happy that he got acknowledged for that.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
But this is interesting because now this is music that was made for the game,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
released on the game soundtrack,

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
an entire body of work dedicated to the game getting nominated for the Grammy.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
And certainly that's, you know, it's like we dipped our toe in with Baba Yetu,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
and now we're starting to put the whole foot in by nominating a game soundtrack.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
And in reality, this is almost as good as it gets.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
I mean, video game soundtrack songs are not going to really get nominated

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
for song of the year unless you have something on the caliber of the Titanic song,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
was the only, like, the last soundtrack song I can think of that got nominated

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
for a song of the year Grammy.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
So, I mean, we're long, long away from that.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
But being up there with all those films, that's an awesome achievement.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So now the question, is he going to win?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I don't know.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
I know. It's hard to say. We're not really in the music industry,

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
so certainly it's got to be getting him a little more exposure, though,

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
than the competition.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
But at the same time, the artist won the Grammy, didn't it?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Or the artist, excuse me, the artist won the Oscar, didn't it?

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
So it's, you know.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I don't know.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I don't know if that really ties in.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Just because it won the Oscar doesn't mean, you know, I'm going to win for music.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
That's very true. You never know what will happen.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
It's a different body of voters, and you never know.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
There might be some people like us that kind of look at it and go,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
yeah, video games should be getting more recognition,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
or there'll be people that react quite the opposite.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
It just really depends on who's voting on those.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
So, Black Wolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
it won't win.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
It's flat out, it won't win.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
But this is what we wanted.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
I don't know if not winning is what we wanted,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
but yes, I don't think that's what he's trying to say.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
I think he's trying to say the acknowledgement next to the film scores

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
is what we wanted.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
And yes, I think to some extent that is what we want.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Could they possibly have a separate category for game soundtracks someday?

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
Could they be getting confused with Journey the game and Journey the band?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Dude, I love Journey.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
They should totally get nominated for best soundtrack score.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Probably not.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
I don't think Journey's been nominated for a Grammy since 82.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
That's why they need to score the next Tron movie.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
All right.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
All right, let's move on with some more news.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Don't stop light speeding.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
This one's about a comment from Gabe Newell on living room PCs,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
which I want to preface this story.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
You were showing me before the show, Loki, this big screen mode in Steam,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
which I got to be honest, I haven't played a lot with,

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
but you were showing it to me.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
And in a nutshell, it does turn your Steam environment

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
into a Xbox-style UI that takes up your full monitor space.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It doesn't look like Windows anymore.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
It looks nice, I think.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, I like the ability that it basically,

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
since it is catered towards using a joystick, which is fine,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
that you can sort your games based on joystick support,

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
whether the games have it or not, which is kind of cool.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
The thing I wish they would add,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
and maybe this is something that they can add later on,

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
is those games that do not support joysticks,

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
maybe have it where you can have some sort of in-Steam client app

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
or something like that, where you can set up almost like an X-PAD-er type thing,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
where you can assign keys to the joystick buttons,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
and then that way you can have a profile for each thing.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
Because a lot of these games, and actually it's funny,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
because Arma 2 is one that supports the joystick,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
and I thought that was one that didn't support the Xbox game pad.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I was like, huh, that already does, so sweet.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
And it's not like a wireless keyboard to use as a controller

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
for a game console is unheard of.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I mean, Final Fantasy XI?

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah. But see, the thing is, as I was looking at it,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I'm like, you know, that would not be that...

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
It wouldn't be that weird to actually...

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
You know, this whole...

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Everyone's kind of talking about Doom and Gloom

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
with the next console cycle and stuff.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Not that it's ever gonna happen, but if it went the way where,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
oh, we're gonna lock all this stuff down,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
you're not gonna be able to sell used games and stuff like that,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
would playing on PC be that bad?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
No, I don't think it would be that bad, actually.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
If it's all going through Steam,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
it seems very convenient for me.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And honestly, the vast majority of the games I have on Steam

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
I have not played yet.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
And it just keeps adding to the list, but I keep getting things for it.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
But I have quite a collection that it would be kind of cool to have

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
a gaming PC hooked up to my TV to play stuff like that.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Well, that is where Gabe Newell thinks things are going,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
meaning that those types of living room PCs

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
are going to be big competition for the next-gen gaming cycle.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
This is in an interview with Kotaku at the VGAs,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
because, you know, Gary Newell was there.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Was that what she called him? Gary Newell? Something like that.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Kind of messed up. There's a clip somewhere,

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
one of the interviewees called him the wrong name.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
You're Gabe from Penny Arcade, right?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Gabe Do-Well.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
She apologized for it.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Cousin of Dudley Do-Right.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
She apologized for it on Twitter.

32:45.000 --> 32:51.000
And I gotta say, you know, live TV sucks sometimes, especially, you know.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
It can be a lot of pressure, so I shouldn't give her too hard of a time,

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
but obviously she's going to get yelled at for that mistake.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
But anyway, Gabe Newell doing his thing on the red carpet at the VGAs,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
talking to Kotaku, talking about that the big picture interface

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
ended up being stronger than expected.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Next, they want Steam Linux out of beta.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
They want big picture on that operating system.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
This gives Valve flexibility in developing their own hardware.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
That's true.

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
He says he expects companies to start selling PC packages for living rooms next year.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
They already are. I mean, look at Alienware.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
I mean, it's vastly expensive, but you-

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Look at Ouya.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Ouya is a bare-ass bones type of living room PC.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
But it's that same setup as you would see with big picture mode.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
In fact, the interface looks kind of similar,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
although I do like big picture a little bit.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
But from what I've seen, we obviously don't know what the Ouya looks like,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
although we're not that far away.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
I mean, and that Ouya thing, man, is smaller than this box right here,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
my four-pack of Red Bulls.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Gabe Newell said in the interview,

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
quote, I think in general that most customers and most developers

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
are going to find that the PC is a better environment for them

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
because they won't have to split the world into thinking about,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
why are my friends in the living room,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
why are my video sources in the living room different from everyone else?

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
So in a sense, we hopefully are going to unify those environments.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
Hmm.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
I don't know.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
The unification thing is interesting.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
I think in a way that's what the consoles kind of want to be,

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
that all-in-one device, and you do see that, like,

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
360 tries to talk to Windows Media and all that sharing.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
And even the PlayStation 3, you can kind of stream things off your PC and so forth.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
It's not exactly intuitive on either one how to do it.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
I think if a lot of that was built a little more into the interfaces,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
you'd see a lot more of that.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
I think they make it too many clicks to get to a lot of that stuff within the consoles.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I think it's interesting.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
I think it definitely lends something to the fact of,

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
if they sold a little gaming PC in a box that looked like a console,

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
hooked up to your TV like a console, ran like a console,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
why would I need a console?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Price point, because I think console prices,

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
it's going to be hard to build a gaming PC for $400

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
that can run all of these games and look nice.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
I mean, granted, you can build a $400 gaming PC,

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
but it's not going to run a lot of these games in higher ultra and stuff.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
And if you're streaming to your TV via HDMI,

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I mean, you're talking like a really large resolution,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I mean, 1080p.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
So it's going to be a little hard to make them look that nice

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
and run on that big of a resolution.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
That's the only thing.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
That's why consoles kind of,

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
I mean, granted, a lot of the games get stripped down a bit,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
but that's the thing with PCs and like hell,

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
I spent $1,700 on my PC a few years ago,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
and it was just like this high-end thing.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
It ran Crysis pretty awesome.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And then now it's just junk.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
It's just like I can't even upgrade it without replacing everything.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
There's nothing I can salvage from it except for the case,

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
maybe the heat sinks, but everything else is just, it's so old.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
Well, I find the part where he talks about how Linux,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
the steam on Linux has to get better

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
so that they can kind of develop a box that supports Linux and so forth.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
That strikes me as interesting

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
because why do video game consoles usually work the way they do?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Because they're dedicated gaming consoles.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
They don't have all this excess fat for all the other things that a PC does.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
But the interesting thing about Linux is that, as I understand it,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
part of the reason people are such fans of Linux

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
is that it's a lean operating system,

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
and it doesn't have all the fat that Windows has with it.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
That's what I'm running on my netbook.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Would that be a fair statement about Linux?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I'd say so.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
You've got the control that Windows lacks.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
So they want to use a better operating system, essentially,

37:12.000 --> 37:18.000
to do a dedicated thing, which makes sense,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
but could it be as powerful as a dedicated gaming console?

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I don't know. You make a good point.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Do you expect that a little set-top box is going to do this 1080p?

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
It probably won't.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
Granted, a lot of the games on Steam, aside from the big console,

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
the big triple-A games, like the indie games,

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
a lot of the indie games don't require a lot of processing power,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
I think, that you would need on some of these higher-end games.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
But there are those higher-end games that they're also on Steam,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and a lot of those are the ones that support the controllers.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
So it's going to be hard.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Granted, a lot of this stuff is going to come down in cost,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
and you could probably build something a little bit cheaper,

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
but I think it's going to be difficult for them to come up with something

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
that you can fit in a box small enough.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
I mean, because you also have to worry about heat and everything,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
fitting it into a console-sized box.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
It's going to be a lot of engineering to get it right.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
Akuma JP in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
What's wrong with being a chubby?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
There is nothing wrong with being a little fluffy.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
You'll notice in that whole thing I just talked about,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
I didn't say I was going to throw out my Windows PC.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
No, I mean, there's still things that I'll want one of those for.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Well, I just want to take a quick look real quick.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
The Alienware one, remember, they have their console thing?

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
I was just, you know, an idea.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
So it's the X51 mini gaming desktop,

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
and the base price, because it's from Dell,

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
the base price you can pay for that is $699.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
So $700 for this.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
$699 U.S., $699 U.S.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
And here's what you get for $699.

39:01.000 --> 39:07.000
It's a Core i3, which, I mean, that's not going to run some high-end stuff there.

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
You get 6GB of RAM, you know, a 1TB hard drive,

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
Geforce 640 GT, which is a pretty good graphics card.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
It's not the top, top, top of the line.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
But, you know, the Core i3 is really going to hurt it, I think.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
I don't know, it just seems quite expensive to build something with that form factor.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Obviously, you don't need to pay Alienware to do it.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
You can build your own smaller PCs for probably a lot cheaper than that.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
You know what computer I'm hooking up to my TV as soon as I can?

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
A Commodore 64. And I gotta say, tangent time,

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
to Alan's credit, he told me that he was trying to get me a Commodore 64 for Christmas,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
but it's probably not going to come through.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
Because he tried to do an eBay auction, and it's outside of his price range or whatever.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
But I was like, damn, that would have been awesome!

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Dude, you just need to go down to the Danaios or something like that.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
I don't think I don't look every time I go to see if one's up there.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
You have to make sure it works.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
I actually do go by the thrift stores and keep an eye open, too.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
Well, my parents supposedly still have our old one, and my dad's kept it all these years,

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
and it might still work, so I said I want them to find it.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
I don't even know when I'm going to play on it, that's the thing.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I just fucking want one, okay?

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
There's plenty of Commodore 64 games I could play.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
I'll play Donkey Kong the way I remember it.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
I didn't go to the arcades or have Nintendo that age.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
I played Donkey Kong on Commodore 64.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Cliquavision.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
There you go.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
There you go.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
Gunstar in chat says, the Commodore 64, it's really neato.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Yeah, Weird Al.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
I did tell him, and this is advice for anybody that might be looking for this retro-tastic machine,

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
don't forget that there's also the Commodore 64C, which is totally fine.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
It's smaller and has white keys.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
It's like PS Mini and PS2 or whatever.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Same type of thing.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
And then there was the Commodore 128, which had 64 mode.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
128s are totally fine.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Just throwing it out there.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Everybody get robbed of a Commodore 64.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
Gunstar reminds us the C64 version of Donkey Kong was rad.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
It was because it had the Pie Factory level.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Yes.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
Which is really supposed to be a cement factory or something, but it's pies.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
It was the Pie Factory.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
I know what you mean.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
But I will say that looks-wise, the Cliquavision version was really good.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
For a Cliquavision.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
Hey, the Cliquavision of Mouse Trap was the best one ever.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Alright, moving on.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Dark Sakura.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
More news.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Ugh, Rob.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Less Cliquavision.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Something more current.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
How about Nintendo being butthead?

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
So, you know what you can't do, at least according to Nintendo of Europe?

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
You cannot access 18 related content at certain times of the day.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
In fact, you get a little message that says,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
You can't do this.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Meh.

42:06.000 --> 42:13.000
It actually, one of the NeoGaf users actually had the issue and contacted

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
Nintendo of Italy's customer support and got this message.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
Dear customer, we would like to let you know that Nintendo has always aimed

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
to offer gameplay experiences suited to all age groups.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
Observing carefully the relevant regulations regarding content

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
access that are present in the various European countries.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
We have thus decided to restrict the access to content which is unsuitable

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
to minors, Peggy, to the 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. time window.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
I feel like in that same voice you should be saying,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
For English, press one.

42:45.000 --> 42:51.000
Para español, marque numero dos.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
That was your very polite little operator noise there.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Except this is like Nintendo of Europe, so maybe I should have affected

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
a really bad British accent.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Dear customer, we would like to thank you that...

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
No. Sorry.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
Now that makes me think of that South Park episode with the Worcestershire sauce.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
You know when I called it water shower sauce?

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
So, it's like, you've got to be up all night to download anything.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Meh.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
It's like, ugh, whatever Nintendo.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I don't know if they've done this crap here though.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Have they?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
No. Yeah.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
So, I guess Nintendo really doesn't like Europe.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Unless they want to give them RPGs that we want.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
I don't think it's because Nintendo doesn't like Europe, Jamie.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think it's some type of...

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
They don't like Italy.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
My gut would say it's a law thing, but I'm like, I don't think there is a law.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Is it a culture thing?

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
It's a cover your ass type of thing, which is all Nintendo ever does.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
You know, and I think they would have tried to do it here too,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
except I think Reggie probably put his foot down or shoved up someone's ass

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
and said no.

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
It's weird because I want to come out and say this isn't bad.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Hold on, I'm doing a search.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
But it is bad because I should be able to get what I want.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
It's not bad if it only comes on when you have parental controls on.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Then that's a great idea.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
This would be a great idea for parental controls.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
Although, honestly, why would you want your kids using the shop unattended anyway?

44:19.000 --> 44:26.000
Well, they can let kids drink wine, but they can't see boobs or blood.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
But you don't have boobs in video game.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
In fact, in Europe's culture, boobs are a little less...

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Yeah, because America is freaking backwards.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Well, exactly.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
So violence is much more of a thing over there.

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
So maybe that's the difference because we're so desensitized

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
through a lot of the movies like Saw and all that shit,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
which is taboo over there.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Maybe that's the difference.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
You know what? I think everyone needs to get over it.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Well, here's my thing.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
I wonder if this was kind of a shock for the third parties that are involved in this

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
because if you think about it, why am I going to put my game on your marketplace

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
if you're going to limit the sale to only four hours out of a 24-hour day?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Brilliant question.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
SSJ 100, Matt.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
In all reality, yes.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
I would love to know what the third parties have to say about it.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Who, by the way, sent me a Hanukkah card. SSJ 100, Matt.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
My first one of the year.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Oh, go ahead. Sorry.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
I was going to say, he actually says parental controls are hard for parents,

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
especially stupid ones.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
But, I mean, they shouldn't...

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
They have this stuff in place.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
They don't need to do this time thing as well.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And that doesn't stop anybody.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
That's about as effective as an age gate, okay?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
On a video. That's all it is.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Oh, I can't...

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
You know, a person that knows about Assassin's Creed 3...

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
First off, you'd have to be...

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
No offense, but I think you're going to have to be a complete idiot

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
to go download this game to your console instead of going to buy it retail.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
I don't know why you'd do that unless, I guess, you're under the age or something like that.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
And your parents really don't want to buy it for you.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Although, in which case, I say go to eBay.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
So, I don't understand why you would want to download it to your console in the first place.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And then, on top of that...

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I mean, fuck.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
This person that knows about, you know, these games

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
is probably most likely going to be able to read most of the blogs out there on the internet

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
and go, hey, well, all I do is download this at 11 p.m.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And they download it at 11 p.m.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
Kids shouldn't be using this parent's credit card on the store at any hour of the day.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
And you know whose problem that is?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Their parents.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
And that's whose problem it should always be.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Their parents.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I mean, here's the thing. They may not be using their card.

46:37.000 --> 46:43.000
They may be buying, you know, a prepaid card at a store, you know, and putting it in that way.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
All right.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So, there's ways around everything.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
But once again, there's ways around everything.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
So, why limit it?

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
Okay, and I know the comment about parental controls being hard earlier was said in jest or a joke or whatever.

46:54.000 --> 47:01.000
But seriously, when you first turn on the Wii U, the first time you're going through the initial setup,

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
there is a question.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
Do you wish to enable parental controls? Yes or no?

47:06.000 --> 47:13.000
So, all the parent has to do is be there when their $400 machine is turned on for the first time.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
And I'm pretty sure if this is like any other Nintendo console or device that comes with it.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
$300, excuse me.

47:19.000 --> 47:26.000
Like, four, like, thick fucking manuals that probably tell you how to set up, you know, parental controls if you really wanted to.

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
And if your kids aren't getting some sort of prepaid card, where the fuck are they getting the money to buy this?

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
Let's just say it's maybe like, I don't know, it's just stupid.

47:37.000 --> 47:47.000
It's basically saying, oh, well, you know, we made this hardcore console that's really only available for, you know, children is what we've marketed this console to.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
I mean, they're like, oh, yeah, we want this console for the grownups.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
This is going to have hardcore games.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Oh, but sorry, you're not going to be able to play those hardcore games because this console is really just for children.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
Breakman in our chat says censorship is a fucking bitch-ass whore slut.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
You know what it is?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Correct.

48:03.000 --> 48:11.000
It's just that these violent game trailers and games on the internet are very disturbing to elderly people who, thankfully, do not stay up past 11.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Although...

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
If they all just magically fall asleep right before 11.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
Although, that's why, that's why, though, that it only goes till 3.

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
Because a lot of them do wake up quite early in the morning, so it's that 11 to 3 period that most elderly people are asleep.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
That's why they're hiding this.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
It's not because of the kids.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
It's the elderly people.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
VX JasonXV in chat wants to throw out a theory, and it's a good one, so let me throw it out there.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Nintendo is classified as a media service.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
TV.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
And now they have TV with VII.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
TV.

48:41.000 --> 48:48.000
And now they have to abide by TV laws, which restricts content into those hours in some countries.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Not a bad thought.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Is this because Nintendo is not treating itself as a game device anymore?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Because remember, they make their own fucking rules.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
It's not an X-Gen system, it's a Nintendo-Gen system.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
And this is now a television.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
I don't think so, because look at the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

49:06.000 --> 49:13.000
I'd say they have as many, if not more, streaming content on there than Nintendo.

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
It's just, why would you restrict the rules, you know, to one console and not the others?

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
I just, I think this is just something Nintendo is doing on their own.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
I don't think this is anything that they're forcing them to do, because why aren't they forcing the other guys to do the same thing?

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
It's the Nintendo ass hattery, it's what they do.

49:34.000 --> 49:44.000
I don't know if it's ass hattery, but it's very throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which we've seen Nintendo do so many times before, like friend codes.

49:44.000 --> 49:50.000
Friend codes was set up to protect, you know, kids, and we all had to suffer for it.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
It's the same dumb decision that screwed that up that's screwing this up.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Thank God it didn't happen here.

49:58.000 --> 50:05.000
Although at the same time, do you really need to download ZombiU online, like just go to the store and buy it or get it on Amazon?

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
Seriously, just wait, or yeah, I mean Amazon, there's a perfect way, I mean you can do that.

50:11.000 --> 50:19.000
A lot of, I just, I don't know, I don't think, what would be the point of downloading this stuff to your console?

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
I just, I don't know, for that type of stuff, unless you're like, you know, Steam, I understand, because a lot of times I buy stuff on sale,

50:26.000 --> 50:33.000
and so, okay, that makes sense, I want to download this, and it's only available digitally, because a lot of PC games aren't available at the market.

50:34.000 --> 50:42.000
But, a console game, I just don't see why I would need to, unless I'm getting some really great discount on it, why I would...

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
I'll throw this out there, for what it's worth, you don't have to pay tax on them right now.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
I mean, technically you do, you have to report that to the state and your taxes at the end of the year, but let's be real, who's doing that?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
So, you get them tax free.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
That's not that much of a savings.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
And you get the 10% kickback from Nintendo if you have a Wii Deluxe, or Wii U Deluxe, which most people probably do, that have the Wii U right now.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
I just, I don't think that would be much of a motivator for me.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Just saying, that is something.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
And you get it right now, well, an hour from now when it finishes downloading.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
I'm probably more than that.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Faster than Amazon.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

51:28.000 --> 51:37.000
Alright, so the Wii U has sold 425,000 units in the U.S. after being out there for a week.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
So, compare that to some of the other systems, I believe, the Xbox 360 and PS3, and the original...

51:44.000 --> 51:49.000
Well, the original Wii, I want to say, sold only 300,000 units during that same time period.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
The original Wii, I think they say in that same article, is 475.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
475?

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
Well, yeah, it sold 475 in its first week, but I'm talking about actually now.

52:03.000 --> 52:09.000
Like, I think it sold only, I think it was 300,000 units or something like that.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
It was still pretty high.

52:11.000 --> 52:19.000
And of course, the Xbox 360, I think it was three quarters of a million, and I want to say the PS3 was like five or something like that.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
So, I guess that's pretty good.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Here's my thing, though.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
And this is unlike, you know, the Wii.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
So, you remember with the Wii, the whole reason was shortages on this stuff.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
Last I checked, I went to the store, like, I went to Walmart one day, and I was like,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
you know what, I'm just gonna go walk down Electronics Island, see what they've got as far,

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
let's see if they have any Wii U's, just see if they've finally gotten stock.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
And there was a stack of ten Wii U's.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
No, it wasn't like, oh, people are clamoring to get this stuff.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
It was just sitting there, no one gave a shit.

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
And same with, like, you go on, like, GameStop, and you can do a search of their inventories and stuff like that.

52:57.000 --> 53:04.000
And I'd say about the majority, well, all of them had some stock on them, and some of them had quite a bit of stock on them.

53:04.000 --> 53:13.000
So, I know that they were doing more to replenish them, but I'm thinking that the demand on this isn't as high as they had hoped.

53:13.000 --> 53:22.000
I mean, yeah, $425,000 sounds awesome, but is that gonna dip off really fast, because they're just sitting there now?

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
I don't know. I don't know. I think it's still too soon to tell.

53:27.000 --> 53:35.000
I think we need to see what the entire holiday season looks like, and we need to see what the Fury looks like after the holidays.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
Like, was it just a holiday thing, or is it still in demand in January and February?

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
But you know what it's gonna take to keep that demand going? Games!

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
And we've got... Pikmin?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
In March.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
Wii U games? Let me refresh my memory right here.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
Wii U games, we've got, um...

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
30 Great Games? What's that game with the bear?

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
Family Party, 30 Great Games, Arcade, or Obstacle Arcade.

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
Tell me you've seen the Miiverse stuff for the 30 Great Games stuff.

54:10.000 --> 54:20.000
Oh my god. Miiverse is becoming more and more like one of the most genius things to happen in gaming ever.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
And I'm not giving Nintendo all that credit. It's an idiot savant type of genius.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
It's unintended genius.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
Where, like, Miiverse is amazing.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
Have you seen the stuff on Miiverse for some of these, like, shovelware games that show up?

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Alright, I gotta get the Wii U. You've gotta see this.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
Loki, you'll laugh your ass off at some of the stuff that people are posting in Miiverse on these games.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
But anyway.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
But I was gonna see, like, right now I'm looking just to see what's in this area.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
You know, as far as, like, availability.

54:53.000 --> 54:59.000
And let's see here. The first one, low stock, in stock, in stock, in stock, low stock, in stock, in stock, in stock.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
And that's the, you know, first eight stores that they have there.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
In stock, in stock, in stock, low stock, in stock, low stock, low stock.

55:07.000 --> 55:14.000
So, it looks like, you know, within, you know, 20 miles of us, they are stocked at every single GameStop.

55:14.000 --> 55:20.000
And I think that's the same thing, you know, happening at, you know, Walmarts, Targets, probably everywhere.

55:20.000 --> 55:26.000
So, that begs the question, I mean, I understand this may be a hot holiday item.

55:26.000 --> 55:35.000
But, I don't think it's as, I don't think it's as in demand as they want it, they want everyone to believe it is.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
And don't get me wrong, they have some pretty good games at launch, but they don't really have anything coming out.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
Like, the first Wii U game I can think of is in March.

55:43.000 --> 55:53.000
Rayman Legends is the, not March, February 26th is Rayman Legends, is the first big game to come out next.

55:53.000 --> 56:03.000
Cool, that's like a whole month and a half, almost two and a half months of nothing for the Wii U.

56:03.000 --> 56:11.000
I mean, that's kind of bad. That's not a good, you know, that's quite a drought of games.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
Okay, I'm going to give this to you while I read the next story. I'm just going to give this to you.

56:16.000 --> 56:22.000
Just scroll through and look at some of the posts on this game. Use the joystick on the left.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
You can just scroll going up and down, because there's some funny shit on there.

56:26.000 --> 56:35.000
Alright, moving on to the next story, which is about other things coming to the Wii U that I could hand the tablet to Loki during the show and have him take a look at.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
Wii U Panorama View is coming in the spring.

56:39.000 --> 56:48.000
This is something that will let you view panoramic videos on your gamepad by actually moving the device around so you don't necessarily use the joysticks to spin around.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
You can actually pick up the device and move it around like one of those early Wii U demos.

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
That will be in the spring for both North America and Europe. That will be an eShop release.

56:58.000 --> 57:06.000
There is a free preview demo that will be going on the eShop that will have some scenes that will come in advance of the actual release.

57:06.000 --> 57:16.000
Now, I have no idea how these pictures are taken or where they come from. I'm assuming there's a particular format standard out there, because I know I've seen panoramic pictures online before.

57:16.000 --> 57:23.000
Interesting. I don't know if it's particularly useful, but okay. Google Maps.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
What's on his head?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Oh, that was from Nintendo Direct.

57:26.000 --> 57:32.000
So basically it's just your average forum with all sorts of memes in here.

57:32.000 --> 57:42.000
But that is Nintendo moderated and endorsed on the console. If you press pause and hit Miiverse, that is what you'll see.

57:42.000 --> 57:49.000
Yeah, that's cool that they're only removing offensive stuff, but not a lot of memes are offensive.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
Do you see a lot of the stuff with the jokes about shovels?

57:53.000 --> 58:03.000
Yeah, I understand the Nintendo seal of crap. I understand that, but I hardly call this genius. I just call this your standard forum.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Are you not entertained?

58:05.000 --> 58:14.000
No, I'm not entertained. I mean, I just don't know.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
This is just in everybody. Loki is not amused.

58:16.000 --> 58:32.000
I mean, they have Barry Potter and Batman that says, I have no family. I don't know. I don't think this is that great.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Maybe it was better the first couple days. Some of it's wearing off.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Alright, look. Moving on.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
It's kind of funny, I guess.

58:43.000 --> 58:51.000
Anyhow, PanoramaView was originally unveiled at E3, but they announced that it is coming in the spring, obviously.

58:51.000 --> 59:01.000
Also coming, Google Maps for Wii U. The Street View functionality with Google Maps will work with the gamepad just like PanoramaView.

59:01.000 --> 59:07.000
Because those Google cars take the panorama screenshots all the time.

59:07.000 --> 59:13.000
That app will be in the eShop in late January. It will be free until the end of March.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
Google Maps will be coming to the U.S. eShop in the first quarter.

59:16.000 --> 59:21.000
So notice how it's not going to be forever that that thing is going to be free.

59:21.000 --> 59:26.000
But I think that's kind of cool that Google Maps is coming. I mean, I don't know the particular usefulness of it.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
I better buy a Wii U so I can get Google Maps.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
What's with the flying penis rocket ship?

59:34.000 --> 59:41.000
That's Miiverse. Somebody tried to get away with drawing a penis on Miiverse and they drew it as a rocket ship.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Hey, this isn't uncomfortable.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
Yeah, I thought you played with the Wii U thing before.

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
Not with your little thing here. I'm not going to say anything about your little thing.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Let's move on. Dark Soccer, it's actually your turn. You'll have to put the tablet down for a minute.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Take your evil away from me, Rob.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So, next, people have been going off about this.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And, you know what? I was going to be super skeptical of it until I actually did look at the logo.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Needless to say, I'm talking about the Phantom Pain, which basically is a trailer of a guy that they had at the VGAs.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
The guy has a hook arm and he's like, you're just waking up, and then a hundred feet soldier. We're getting killed out here.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And if you look at the guy walking around, he's got a gray mullet and a shaggy beard when you can sort of see his face, but most of his face is covered up in bandages.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And he's missing a hand, he's got a hook arm, and it's being put out by this Moby Dick Studios.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Which, I mean, I can't really think of anything how Moby Dick itself, you know, could be an illusion towards it.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Because, I mean, it's just a big revenge story, so maybe there's some revenge subplot? I don't know.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:19.000
But the company is supposed to be some Swedish company, and the CEO is Joakim Mogren, but the J-O-A-K-I-M is an anagram for Kojima.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
People are thinking this is actually a trailer for Metal Gear Solid 5.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Now, as I posted much earlier in the chat room, is that if you look at the logo, there are little chunks missing out of the text.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And if you use the same typeface and align it to these little markings that are coming out of the text, it perfectly fits the shape of Metal Gear Solid 5.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And I will relink the photo in the chat room for those who are curious.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000
But, I mean, and I mean, I'm even looking, it has to be, of course, in the same typeface, but it is a perfect match.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It's sort of like they posted it there and then used the Pathfinder tool in InDesign or something, for anyone who knows what that is.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:21.000
But, um, I guess I see it now. I didn't see it at first until I looked at the logo.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It makes sense that, you know, it's time for another Metal Gear Solid. I know they always say the other one's gonna be the last one, but come on.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
They'll take that until it stops making money.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I don't know. I don't know if it's Metal Gear Solid. I think it's New Bionic Commando.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And, spoiler!

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
What?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
His wife is his claw.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
No.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Spoiler!

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Just look at the picture that I linked in the chat room, guys.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
That was the plotline in the first Bionic Commando game that they made for you.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
How does that work? The more time on spoilers is up on the game. I'm never gonna play that game. I wanna know.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
How does that work? How is his wife the claw?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
She's the AI that's in there. Like, it's her AI. Or her.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
So she's GLaDOS.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
You can marry-

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Yeah, it's like GLaDOS.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
You can marry AI.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
No, the AI can be turned-

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Well, they dumped her personality in there.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
The Supreme Court is gonna decide next year if I get to get married or not, but you can marry your AI.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
To quote Rob, put her in a CD. I don't care.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
They had all those tubes, and they're like, we need to fill the tubes with something.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
So they just threw his wife in a wood chipper, shoved her in the tubes for the Bionic Commando.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I mean, that's-

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
You shouldn't put your wife in a wood chipper. That's wrong.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
She'll say she can't, but put her in there anyway.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Well, he didn't put her in a- I don't know.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Why would you put your wife in a wood chipper? That's really rude.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Maybe he's just really into self-gratification, and so, you know, he thought his wife is the claw.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That's wrong.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Men.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Because the claw touches him in ways that-

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
The claw.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
His hand can't.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It decides who will go and who will stay. Ah.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Can we please, please get to release dates?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I guess.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Although I'm not expecting to hear an awful lot, but let's see. Release dates.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Alright, so this week we've got the game of the year, The Walking Dead.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
The whole, basically, season one on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
007 Legends on the Wii U.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I mean, that's pretty awesome, right? Cool.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U, like with Vanna White and shit?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Yeah. Awesome.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah, it's the game-

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
60 bucks?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It's the game that they, yeah, it's like 40, I think.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It's the game that they put out on the Wii and Xbox 360 earlier.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I like Wheel of Fortune. I'm real good at it.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Well, there you go. And Jeopardy. Jeopardy on the Wii U.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I'm not as good as Jeopardy. That's for smart people.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Not anymore, really. Have you ever watched Jeopardy lately?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I can only watch Celebrity Jeopardy.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
And then-

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Damn you, Trebek!

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on the Vita.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Oh, I was like, isn't that on every platform?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
No, not the Vita and 3DS. 3DS got delayed a little further.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
That's it, and I hate to say it, I think that's it for the rest of the year.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Well, we'll check in again next week and see what shovel week they were able to put together in a week.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Alright, meanwhile in Japan, there's still some things trickling through. Not a lot, but some things.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction in the Premium Edition coming out December 13th.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Along with, I believe this is a new game, Port Royale 3.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I don't recognize this as a series here. Maybe Loki-

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.000
It came out on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in August, I think.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It's like a Pirates game.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah, it's a Pirates simulation game.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
But not Sid Meier's Pirates.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
No, it's Calypso, I want to say, puts that out.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Russell in Japan, but-

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I think over here it's Calypso.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:23.000
They're the guys that put out Tropico, so it's a trading sim.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
You can be a pirate or trader.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Much busier week on the PlayStation 3, Battlefield 3 also there as well, and Port Royale 3.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Ninja Gaiden Sigma also gets a price reduction along with Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But as far as new games go, Sango Kushi 12 comes out in regular and Premium Editions from Koei.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000
This is 12. What is this? Is this Nobunaga, like, a new version of it?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It very well could be.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
No, that's Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I just recognized one of the kanji.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
It's a big release this week too, so that wouldn't surprise me at all.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Whenever you see Sangoku, Three Kingdoms.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000
You run a country, build facilities, develop skills. The skills can be military-based, politics-based, or fundamental.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Or artistic dance.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
No, you cannot have artistic dance.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Also, price reduction for Sangoku Basara 3 Utage.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
So lots of price reductions this week, just in time for Christmas.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000
On the Vita this week in Japan, Jikuyu Powerful Pro Yakuyu 2012 Petai Ban.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
That's the Konami Baseball series on the Vita this week.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
On the PSP this week, yes, the PSP.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
7th Dragon 2020 gets a price reduction.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And then we have Arcana Famiglia Festa Regalo comes out this week.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I have no idea what that is on the PSP.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
But it has free shipping.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Depending where you order it from, yes.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
These guys are dressed up like it all in little suits.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
They're little chibi suit characters, but this one has an eye patch, so you know he's rough.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Oh, he's badass.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
He is.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I have no idea.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That guy looks like a chibi Kratos, and that guy looks like a chibi Cloud, doesn't he?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yeah, then who's the dude with the eye patch?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I don't know.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Chibi Snake?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Could be.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Shining Hearts also on the PSP gets a price reduction this week.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Going to the Wii U.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Sangokushi 12 comes out on the Wii U this week in Japan as well.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And lastly, checking the 3DS.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Biohazard Mercenaries 3D gets a price reduction.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And Inazuma 11 Go 2 Chrono Stone Nepuyu and Ramay come out this week from level 5.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And Rob will hyperventilate now.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Yes, I will.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Oh, Puyo Puyo gets a price reduction.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Puyo Puyo.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
No one cur.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I care.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Okay, one cur.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
That does it for Japanese release dates.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
In Europe, not a damn thing.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
The end.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Seriously, not a damn thing.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
The game will be out the entire week.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
A different version for every system that has ever existed all week.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I'm serious.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Not a damn thing.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Just crickets?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Just crickets.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Nothing until the 17th.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Alright.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Which is not this week.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Let's do a couple more stories before the Classic Game of the Week, then.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Alright.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So, Motorola has failed to ban the Xbox in both the US and Germany.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And apparently, I guess, a judge has ruled that Google's Motorola can't ban the sales of the Xbox 360

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
over a patent dispute.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And, of course, no one had any comment on it and the case moves on.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So, that's good and kind of what we thought would happen.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I don't think they would ban the sale over that, but.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Yeah, can you imagine if they just suddenly pulled the Xbox 360 off of Shells?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
They're just gonna, you know, go through the courts right now and I'm sure at the end

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
that they're gonna settle or have to pay some sort of royalties or something.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Somebody's going to.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So, we'll see.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Going to a game that once could have been, but it's not gonna be, Guitar Hero 7.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Guitar Hero 7, at one point, it was gonna happen.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It was in development, but Activision canned it in 2011.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
This is all coming from an anonymous source via Kotaku, so take it with a huge grain of salt.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But, it certainly sounds plausible.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Guitar Hero 7 was going back to the roots, meaning it was only gonna use a guitar.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So, it was gonna lose the drums, the mic, and all that other stuff.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Rock Band kind of had the lock on that, so it was gonna go back to just guitar.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But, the guitar was gonna go through some changes.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
A full six strings and an extra button in the neck.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
However, the guitar apparently was expensive.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
It was a disaster. Unresponsive.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
So, that was not gonna be happening.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Vicarious Visions was the team that was developing it.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000
They were gonna do this thing where the music video would actually change for each song.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
So, they were trying to separate themselves from Rock Band, which I applaud.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
But, I don't know. I guess maybe this music video thing wasn't really working out.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
But, maybe that would have been the theme, was making music videos like MTV.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Apparently, the songs were not that great either.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
It was all the worst hits from the 1990s.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
In other words, stuff like Closing Time and Sex and Candy.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Closing Time.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Remember, that's the old outro for this show.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I know, but to tell you something else about that.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
In magazine class, last time we did it, not this semester, but last year.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.000
At the end of every class, we would play that song right before we had our meeting.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
That's what that song makes me think of.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And yes, some good conversation in chat.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
VX Jason XV is like, why the jump to 7?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I knew there was Guitar Hero 4.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And Oren G points out Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
So, there were other games in between.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
That's not even counting the spinoff games.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Like, there was Band Hero.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Was that the Taylor Swift one was Band Hero?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
What was the family hero?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Who gives a crap about Taylor Swift?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I'm just saying.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It was Band Hero and then...

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I don't know if they had anything else other than Band Hero.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
We all stopped paying attention after Guitar Hero 3, okay?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I'm just saying.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Not to mention all the band-specific ones.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Van Halen, Aerosmith, Metallica.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Guitar Hero 7 was cancelled in the middle of its two-year development cycle.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
It could have been out by now.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
It could have been.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Kind of wish they'd have a new DJ hero.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Right?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
You know, I picked up DJ Hero for 20 bucks.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
It's awesome. Seriously, the soundtrack is still awesome.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That's a game that could have won it for the soundtrack.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I need to go back and play that game again.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
There's some really good mixes in that game.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It's awfully sad.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Well, remember a time when we didn't have seven versions of a particular game?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Yes, we did.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Well, unless it was Mega Man.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
No, unless it was Street Fighter 2.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Oh yeah, there is that.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
There is that.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Is this game before or after Street Fighter 2?

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
As we get into the classic game of the week,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
where Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
and find a game that is older or about the same age as Street Fighter 2.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Contemporary.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And say, hey, you should be playing this game this week, dammit.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Yeah, dammit.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And this is another one that Dan picked out,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
because I couldn't think of anything.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Sunset Riders.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
This is a good pick.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Did you ever play it?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I did.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Sunset Riders.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Actually, I have played it.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
The only place that had one was in an arcade,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
which was a tilt arcade in Dothan, Alabama,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
and then it was gone.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
But Sunset Riders is a side-scrolling game,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
and you basically run around and shoot guys with your guns,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
and you jump from back to back of stampeding cattle and ride horses.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And it's like, I like how the article says it's a fanciful Wild West.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Old West.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
In the co-op version, you could either do a two or four player,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and you could get hookers and boos, Rob.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
That's always the best, isn't it? Hookers and boos.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So the game was supposed to be set, like I said, in the American Old West,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and it's four bounty hunters who are out to get the rewards

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
of the most wanted outlaws in the West.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And in between each stage, it shows you a wanted poster of whoever it is

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and your reward and wanted dead or alive.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
You know, that type of thing.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
So you play as Steve and Billy,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
and their guns are peacemakers, which are faster.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And then you have Bob and Cormano,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
which I don't even know if that's a real name,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
but I was laughing because he's wearing a pink poncho.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And they both use shotguns, so they have wider shots.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And in the two player mode,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
you actually can choose the character you want to control

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
before you start the game.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
But in four player, each person is assigned to a character,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
kind of like how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Just like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
which is clearly the engine this game is using, just saying.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
This is definitely, they're trying to make lightning strike twice after that

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
It's clearly the same hardware, which is fine.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
But this game has hookers.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
See, look, he goes in the room and there's a hooker.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had April O'Neil.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
She wasn't a hooker.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
She did have clean stuff.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Some of the pictures I've seen she is.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Clearly you haven't been on Tumblr.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Anyway, any, whatever.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Dirty Men.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Everyone can be a hooker on Tumblr.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Dirty Men.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Okay.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Especially Hawkeye.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Yeah, well, the Hawkeye initiative is awesome.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So, anyway, you can jump from different floors,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
which use the joystick and jump, you know, the usual thing.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You can shoot downwards diagonally or vertically while crouching.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And, I mean, it's basic, you know, run and gun controls for a game like this.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.000
You have badge shaped power-ups that you get by beating these guys carrying sacks.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
The silver badge gives you a second gun,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
so you can shoot in two directions at the same time.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And the gold badge lets you fire continuously when you hold down the shoot button.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And you can use both power-ups together.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
There's eight stages and you basically have to reach the end of each stage

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
and beat the bad guy and get your money.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Yee-haw.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Although when I saw the first boss, I was asking Dan today,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
is he not wearing any pants?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Because it looked like he wasn't wearing pants.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I think it was just the perspective in the game.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And Dan said that the only people not wearing pants were the hookers.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And the cowgirl, which he just shot.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And those chickens.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And the chickens.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And the stampede and cattle.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
They're not wearing pants either.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Wasn't that a scene in the Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I don't know if I know. I haven't seen it.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So you get your power-ups, like I said, if you have rapid fire, dual fire,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
and you also get a monetary award.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Or a turkey worth $500.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I've never seen a turkey worth $500.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I'm sure that has to be...

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
You're not doing enough shopping at Whole Foods.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Whole Paycheck.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So the stages are, you have Simon Greedwell, Hawkeye Hank Hatfield,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Dark Horse, which just makes me think of Bad Horse in Dr. Horrible.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000
The Smith Brothers, El Greco, wouldn't that mean the Greek?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Bob, is it like Greco, Spanish for Greek?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Sure.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Okay.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Chief Scalpem.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Oh, Scalpem, which is...

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Oh, insensitive.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Paco Loco.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And Sir Richard Rose, a British man who's shooting from the balcony behind two lions.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
There were...

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I'm trying to find my favorite part, which is...

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Oh yeah, the stuff about the SNES version.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Okay, I'm going to get back into that.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
There were two major ports.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
There was the Mega Drive version, which was the Sega Genesis,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
where it actually...

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Two of the characters in the Genesis version were given surnames when they didn't have one.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
It was Billy Cool and Cormano Wild.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
So they were cool and wild, apparently.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And only four of the bosses were there, so the four chapters were divided into two stages.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And the bosses in this version were Greedwell, Paco Loco, Scalpem, and Richard Rose.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And the bounties were different. They were increased depending on who it was.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And the Genesis one had what looks like a two-player versus mode, where you could fight each other in a gunfight.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
The SNES version had fewer changes.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000
You could still play only up to two players at a time, but it had all eight stages with their bosses.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And all the power-ups were the same, but there were some different...

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I would say...

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Censoring done.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
The whore that... I'm just going to call her a whore. I don't care.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
She's supposed to be, I guess, like a bar girl, but she's totally done like an old West call girl.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
She kisses the player in stage one and the saloon dancers in stage four.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
They're dressed more conservatively.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
The hunter dogs were taken out of the SNES version, but they were in the Genesis version.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And the Native American enemies were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpem, who was renamed to Chief Wigwam.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Yeah, because that's just as good.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.000
And the dynamite-tossing female bandits were taken out as well, but they were still in the Genesis version.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So, yeah, sunset riders.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Which I also think is funny, because you know how when you're reading the articles they have a C also?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I love that it lists Wild West CAW boys of Moomasa.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
That's just wonderful.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I like the stage where you're going along the train and shooting the bandits.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yee-haw!

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000
You know, you say that, and then you mention Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and now I'm thinking, yee-haw, Ninja Cowboy.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Well, in chat they were talking about Gunsmoke, the NES game. You know, kind of like the other Western shooter game.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Yeah.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000
See, Dan kept correcting me and saying Call Girl, and I'm like, it's a whore.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
She's a whore.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
She is a whore.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
My mom says, a whore.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
She walks the night. She is a tramp.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
There it is, your Classic Game of the Week. Sunset Riders.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And no, I'm not doing Mass Effect for Classic Game. It's not old enough yet.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
It's getting there.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I'll Classic Game you.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I don't know. It feels like it's that old.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Fine. Next week, Mass Effect.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
No. Games have to be at least ten years old. Alright.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And yes, Fifth Dream, my mom really actually does say it that way.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Who-er.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Who-er?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
My mom, well, my granddaddy said it that way.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
My granddaddy was from Bridgeport, Connecticut, and my mom's a Southern girl.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
So it translated to Who-er.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Alright, enough whore talk. More talk about the Classic Game of the Week.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
We need more whores!

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Sunset Riders.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Whores need love too, only they charge for it.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
We've got plenty more show to come.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
We're gonna talk some Microsoft, Cloud Gaming, Idol Master.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Yes, Idol Master.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And whores.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Maybe some whores.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Maybe some whores will call us at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
That is our name on Skype.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
We will be taking calls after the break.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
When we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio, stay tuned.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio Live on this Sunday evening, December the 9th of 2012, with the 485th episode of our show.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
We're about to get into rapid-fire news.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Myself and Loki here in the studio and DarkSakura in the kitchen.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
She volunteered. She's in there. She's making more latkes.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Alan, you are not prepared for the mountain of latkes that are gonna be here when you get home.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I hope you like potatoes.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And matzah.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
And matzah.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
They're good, though. Not gonna lie.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
All right. Anyhow, while she finishes those up, we will get into some rapid-fire news.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I gotta talk about this real quick, though.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Loki, do you play a lot of fighting games, Loki?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
You don't talk a lot about fighting games. Do you play a lot?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
No, not really.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Not really? Did you ever play Capcom vs. SNK 2?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
That was…

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I think so.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Well, you know why you probably would have played it?

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Is that that was the big fighting game they had at Golf Land back when we all were playing DDR.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I've played it on my MAME cabinet, so…

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Okay.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Well, during the break, we were playing just some random music from games.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
That's what we usually do for the live break.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So we can, like, get water, use the restroom, and do all that live.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
The pod…

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Make… Make latkes, like DarkSakura's doing.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And what have you.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And you guys during the podcast don't get that, but we play some music.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And while the Capcom vs. SNK 2 song was playing, somebody in chat said…

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Where was this?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
S2100Matt said,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
There isn't an HD remix of Capcom vs. SNK 2 coming out anytime soon, huh?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And it made me think, no there's not.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And that made me sad that there is no…

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Oh my god, that's a lot.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
DarkSakura, you are making me so fat.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I am fat because of you.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Look at your life, look at your choices.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Anyway, no HD version of it.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000
For me to sit on my fat ass and eat latkes and play Capcom vs. SNK 2 HD.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
That is just not happening.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
No.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
That makes me sad.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Yeah.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I guess it's all the rights issues, but it is frustrating.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
You see, like, DarkStalkers and Street Fighter 3.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Well, they're probably right now, they're working with, you know, Namco and that stuff.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.000
So maybe they just, you know, because right now I think SNK is being distributed through Atlas.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Because the last game that they had was King of Fighters.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
King of Fighters, yeah.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So, I mean, I would imagine that Atlas would work with them.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000
After all, I don't know if you guys know, it's Persona 4 Arena, best fighting game.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Which is very unusual.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I mean, you would think that that might go to, like, Street Fighter X Tekken or something like that.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Or even, I don't know if it's too late, but PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or something like that.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000
But definitely going a little bit more niche with who's winning these things.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Very interesting.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Well, sometimes the Oscars don't always go to the big budget movies.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
In fact, they often don't.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
They go to the niche stuff.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Maybe the VGA is taking a nod from that.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I don't know.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It's interesting.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Let's see.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Chatters are complaining that they are not getting latkes.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Come over.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Tell them to make your own damn latkes.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Dark Soccer is yelling from the kitchen, make your own damn latkes.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Dark Soccer is going to set off the smoke alarm.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Watch.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
It's over.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
No, it's over here.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Yeah, good idea.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
The last thing we need.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I can say that's one thing that hasn't happened in 11 years of Orange Launch Radio is that we've had to evacuate.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I've set up the smoke alarm before when drinking bacon late at night.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000
But then we had the smoke alarm defense system, whereas the giant fan aimed at the smoke alarm.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
We've had the power go out.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
We've passed out drunk during the show.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
We've never had to evacuate.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
That is.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Yeah.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Oh, yeah, that's true.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
We did.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
We lost the soundboard.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
All right.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Some quick news stories for you guys.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Loki starting us off.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So Minecraft's getting another update as they tend to do.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Of course, we know the big update, the Redstone updates coming in January.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
But until then, they're going to get some smaller updates.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
One point four six is going to be the next one.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And some of the things you can expect for one point four six that are actually available right now in Snapshot 12 W forty nine a include fireworks.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Yes, it's only, I don't know, five months late, but fireworks are getting added in.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:48.000
You can actually craft different colored fireworks, fireworks that sparkle, fireworks that go higher, lower and even fireworks that are shaped like creepers.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And then also there's supposed to be some a book that you can use to enchant items and of course, other bug fixes and stuff.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
But one point four six is supposed to be released sometime before Christmas.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
So next week or so.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000
You know who I found out today plays Minecraft, my nine year old cousin.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I thought it was interesting. You can join the VOG network.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I think it's not. I don't trust that. We seriously had a moment.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
We had we had someone join this week and they're like, is this seriously?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
No one on here all the time. Like, I'm on here.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And his mom was telling me, do you know how many viruses we've gotten on our computer?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Because he keeps trying to find a free version of Minecraft. There is no such thing as a new version of Minecraft.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:45.000
There are all virus. I had I had we had to kind of explain that because it's like, yeah, you have to log in with your account.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
There's you can play in cracked servers is the only way he can get around that.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Well, it's not even I said you can do the free version that doesn't have all the I mean, he's nine.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
He's not going to miss all that stuff. Although he was asking me, he's like, have you ever built a nether portal?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I'm like, no. A nine year old just kicked my ass at a video game.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You didn't have to because we did it all for you. There's like 50 of them.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Yeah, I know. All right. So Last of Us was revealed to be coming out May seven.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
This is coming from the trailer that played during the VGA. So, yay.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Another game. And last but not least, in the realm of I don't give a shit about this,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000
but we're going to report it anyways, because originally it had something to do with gaming, but now it's so far away from gaming.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
G4 or what used to be G4 is now becoming the Esquire channel.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Wow. I could really care less about that. In fact, I do care about as little about that as possible.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But apparently it is a network that is going to be aimed at the metro sexual male.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That has to be a joke by the writer. I don't think they actually are targeting the metro sexual male,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:03.000
although that would be kind of funny if they were. They're saying that the channel will feature some gaming oriented material.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And of course, subjects also is fashion, cooking and travel.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Vomit is what I say. I don't know. I hope this I hope this crashes and burns pretty fast.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And honestly, I think it will. Dark soccer. Do you think metro sexual is hot?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Whatever that's supposed to mean anyway. Huh? Metro sexual. I know.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And I'm like, huh? I need to know that I like it authentic.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I want to know where they can be running reruns of Queer Eye for the straight guy, because that's, you know, pretty metro sexual right there.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
They should reboot it. Actually, what was we watched?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
What was it? We watched the pilot episode of that. And it's like, whoa, this is weird.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
The British version was really good. Different people on here. OK.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Alan's a big fan of the Nerdist and Chris Hardwick and all that. Yeah.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So, like, he likes to listen to podcasts that aren't mine. So that's fine.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
He listens to mine, too. But he likes to listen to he's probably listening now.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
In fact, he likes to listen to the Nerdist with Chris Hardwick.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And I guess they've been doing a lot of because I guess somebody involved with that show is involved with Attack of the Show right now after Kevin Pereira left and all that.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And I guess they say that this network is supposed to be brovo is what they're calling brovo instead of Bravo.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
It's brovo. So I'm like the real dude bros of Orange County.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
What exactly does that mean? What is the real duper would be pretty?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It actually would be a fucking awesome show, dude.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Dude, dude, dude, sir, for dudes.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Fist bump, Loki fist bump.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Moving on.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:03.000
An update to the humble bundle. Do you ever fist bump people? Dark soccer all the time.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:12.000
The humble THQ bundle has added, you know, sometimes the bundles kind of add some deals later on in the life.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000
The humble THQ bundle is no different. It got the Red Faction Armageddon DLC called Path of War.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Titan Quest was also added to the bundle.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Titan Quest was a Diablo style RPG created by Iron Lore Studios back when they existed.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000
The humble THQ bundle. By the way, you don't have to rebuy the bundle to get those games.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Just log back into the humble bundle site or use your reuse your code, whatever.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:46.000
You'll get the games to two million dollars earned in twenty four hours, six days to go.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Actually, no, that was three days left, about three point seven million made.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:59.000
So it's probably up to about four million by now. The average price of the bundle, five dollars and fifty eight cents.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And as the article here points out, four and a half shares of THQ stock.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Same price. Amazing.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I didn't know this was a thing, but more import games apparently still coming to the PlayStation Store in the form of PlayStation one classics.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And Gung Ho Online America getting these old Japanese only games and repackaging them for the PlayStation one import store.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I think it's a great idea. I don't know if I'd play any of these games, but Zanuck cross Zanuck.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Kendo rage sequel, Makaruna Makeno 2, Vehicle Cavalier, which was a vehicle combat game with mechs.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Art Kami and Suguro Kuren.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:59.000
That was a board game about Dakota trucks in Japan and Loop Salad, which was a match three puzzle game and finger flashing, which was basically a rock, paper, scissors action game.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Not naked fingers. No finger flashing like that.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I just flashed one of my fingers at Dark Sakura was the one that I retorted only to be polite.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Streets of Rage apparently at one point had a remake. I don't know what kind of like stage this concept was in.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:26.000
This could even be a fan thing for all we know. No, I don't think so. It was confirmed by the studio.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Oh, Sean Noonan was the tweeter that said seems one of my previous projects is leaked.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So it actually kind of shows. It looked pretty bad ass. Yeah. You look in this video here. It does look kind of neat.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:45.000
It's a little more open world than side scroller, but it has that very neon look to it.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And you can, you know, watch the guys beating each other up there in the video.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Ubisoft level designer Sean Noonan. That was the guy that leaked it through Twitter.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
It was reportedly in development. I'm sorry. He confirmed the leak through Twitter.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
He didn't leak it himself. Reportedly was in development at Ruffian Games.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000
There was supposed to be destructible environments, takedowns, street gangs.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But canceled. Not happening.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Guess it just wasn't good enough. Some things are not meant to be.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:29.000
All right. That does it for my rapid fire news. Well, now, did you ever have a TI calculator?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I sure did. In AP calculus. I sure did. Well, I didn't take calculus.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I had one just so I could play pole position and then make it say rude things.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I was on my way to take calculus and I was in pre calc. Unfortunately, I spent too much time programming on my calculator.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game, but. And now we have Dissidia.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:56.000
You should see how they quit. Well, now they've made a portal on a TI 85 calculator.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000
You can actually play kind of a weird version of Portal where.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I guess it's like the the flash one where it's just sort of from the side.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I couldn't really tell the video is not playing on my. Yeah, it was it was from the side.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And, you know, you could shoot portals out in like eight directions.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And they actually had puzzles and a little bit of a story that goes along.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000
So it's pretty cool. That's pretty cool.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Also, on Wii U, Rayman's Legend comes out in the UK on March 1st and in North America on February 26th.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
So for people who are interested in that and have to say it's still looking good.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
And then that's going to be available for people hither and yon.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And then Gianna Sister's Twisted Dreams will be on Xbox Live Arcade next spring.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000
They will be seeing it. It was one of the green light titles and I have it.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:59.000
It's pretty. I haven't really gotten a chance to play much of it, but we shall be seeing it on Xbox.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
There you go. Well, that's cool that it made its way to Xbox. Yeah.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Not bad for Kickstarter, huh? Yeah. It's a fantastic game that I have yet to play.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I have it. I have it. I bought it because I backed the Kickstarter, but I haven't played it yet.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000
use the passphrase, cereal, as in breakfast, cereal.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Let's go to the foogle question of the week.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Every week we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook and Google+.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
You smoosh it together. That's foogle.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
This week I was kind of a goober and I forgot to post the question in a timely manner.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000
So as soon as I joined chat, they were like, Rob, you have not posted the foogle question of the week.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.000
So one of our chatters, Raginator, just said, here, I'm going to give you a question totally free of charge.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I was like, OK. And so Raginator is asking the foogle question this week.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
What is one thing that you learned in quotes from video games over the years?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I thought it was I thought it was a good question.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And you know, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
So if one of you wants to ask the question tonight, go for it.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I think it was a great idea. So let's see what the listeners said.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Let's start tonight on Google+. We had a couple answers on Google+.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Redertainment says, before Assassin's Creed, I didn't know Leonardo da Vinci was gay.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Now I know. And knowing is half the battle. I didn't. Is that true?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Or is that just a like stereotype? I think it's a it's a speculation.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I see. But then again, you know, that type thing was punishable by death back then.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Unfortunate act. Deaf has an answer. English.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Well, I learned the language when I was little, but video games helped me master it.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Quite probably the reason I have a B.A. in translation to never thought of that.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
But what a great way to learn a language playing a video game.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Although then again, some translations may not be the best way to learn English.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I mean, some of the ones back in the day were pretty bad.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
But I think that's a really neat, you know, way to learn a language.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Think about like an MMO when you have to really surround yourself with the language.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
It's immersion. Of course, you get a lot of net speak, too.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000
That kind of screws it up. Like people typing U for Y O U.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
That's I hate it. Appreciate music.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Act F goes on to say I love music and video games helped appreciate all help me appreciate all kinds of music during my early years and especially during my teens.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Without that, probably I wouldn't be doing. I love that music, which is a segment from on Vogue Network dot com.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Today, I've learned lots of trivial things, too, but those two are the most important.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Good answers over there on Google Plus. Let's try Facebook. Quite a few answers on Facebook.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
They're all pretty short, so I'll try to read as many of these as I can.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Raginator answered his own question. I've learned that, quote, herbs, quote, are good for your health.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And I think those in Washington state would be inclined to agree.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I see the joke there. I mean, really, though, there were a lot of speaking of early RPGs.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
It was always the herb that would suddenly make you feel better and just make you forget all the pain.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.000
We used to say when you mix the brown, the red herb and the green herb and you got the brown pile, we would just call it the brown pile or crap.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Or you mix the green herb and the pink herb and suddenly you want to watch a lot of My Little Pony.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Nothing will make me want to watch a lot of My Little Pony, Rob.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Brandon H on Facebook said, Don't try to text in the middle of a race.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I don't know if that means Mario Kart or like an actual race, but, you know, just don't text and drive kids.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Doesn't even work in games.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Katsuhiko J replied and said, Save your game, save often. Ain't that the truth?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Surely you've lost progress in Mass Effect due to lack of saving. Yes, DarkSakura?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
No, actually, because I save often.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
All right. You learned that lesson, huh?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I also have multiple saves at the same place. I have different colors of skin and hair and different hairstyles and eye colors on my Shepard.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Nerd.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Gamer Girl replied and said, Keep calm and keep playing because nothing in a game is as bad as real life.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
At least, unlike life, in a game, there are do-overs and extra lives.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000
What a nice, simple, good answer to the question, right?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Don't throw your controllers. Don't get mad. It's not real life.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And you get three lives, unlike real life.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So don't kill yourself with a PlayStation 3 controller. Out of rage.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Degenerate Johnny replies and said, I've learned that Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Yes. Yes.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
What is that from? I didn't get the reference.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Mass Effect 2.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Where?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Okay. When you get to the Citadel, right?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Yeah.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And there's the military guys standing out there talking to the other two across from the help desk before you go into C-Sec?

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Yeah.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And he goes, What is the first law of physics? An object in motion tends to stay in motion, sir.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I did not pay you for half an answer. Give me the whole thing.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
You know, that type of thing. It's like, until acted upon about an outside object, sir.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Do you know if you shoot this missile through, you know, blah, blah, it will always hit something.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
You're just going off on it.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
That means that Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest motherfucker in the galaxy.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I don't even remember that. Is that just background dialogue?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
No. You stop and you activate them to listen to it.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I just forgot.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Broseidon. I wonder if he'll have a show on Brovo.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Broseidon answers and says, Don't ever think you're better than the game because the game decides if you're going to win,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
or if it might just freeze and glitch and make your past 36 hours pointless.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000
You need to see the rule earlier, Broseidon, that says save now, save often.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Jovidea says, I've learned that when trying to perform operations on the Wii and Trauma Center,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000
it is oftentimes easier to operate while drunk. This makes me question real doctors.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Yes, because Trauma Center is real life. Your real doctors draw a pentagram shape in order to invoke the magic.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Her. Burr replied and said, I learned you only live once. Yolo.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Wait, that can't be right. You missed the one on the three lives. Hello.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Cram replied and said, Save often. Having to replay several hours can leave a game unfinished for a long time.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Loco Poco replied and said, I've learned that flashing your breasts to your opponent is the best kind of fatality to finish them off.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Learned from Black Orchid and Killer Instinct.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Is that a good life lesson, Dark Sakura? Do you flash your breasts at opponents to kill them off?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I flash them at Dan to get him to shut up.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Close enough.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Silent Tom replies and says, I've learned over the years that the princess is always in another castle.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And if you chop down enough grass, you're bound to find money.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Those are both good life lessons, wouldn't you say?

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:37.000
A sale of Sumer Gawa replies and says, if the camera focuses on it, it's important.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Here it is. Your answer. So in that alive, the breasts are important.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio and you can find our community on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I did learn something, by the way.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
That was a good question, Raginator. Good job.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I learned something last night, Rob.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
My hacked Mass Effect 3 will now work in multiplayer.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
As long as I don't hit the button.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Oh, you. All right. Let's move on with some more news.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
So there has been a listing on LinkedIn.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.000
There one ads for, I guess, a Microsoft's interactive entertainment business studio Soho.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:23.000
They're seeking a television producer to develop and deliver a number of new TV products.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Basically, it says Soho Productions is pushing the boundaries of Kinect and Xbox Live and would like to bring a new line of interactive television experiences to the world.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Working with leading global entertainment partners, we're creating experiences that are not bound by the traditional definitions of television or gaming.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Experiences where watching and participating are inseparable and will delight and enrich the lives of people everywhere.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
So this kind of goes back to a few different rumors.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:03.000
One, that this might be something that's incorporated into the next Xbox system and also to that whole set top box thing that they're going to be putting out.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000
To me, it sounds like they're kind of building on the whole, you know, Kinect TV stuff.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:18.000
You know, like what they did with Sesame Street and not Geo, that they're going to be doing some other types of interactive TV things.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Maybe bringing back 1 versus 100 or something like that might be kind of cool.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:28.000
So that's what it sounds like to me or maybe it's just something else.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:37.000
But hopefully it's not implemented really stupid like, now you can vote on this, you know, thing or something.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Do you like Xbox or not?

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
You know, I think you're doing something similar for the Spike VGA.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
It's where they had it where you can stream it and interact with TV and stuff.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
They were doing it for the political debates on Xbox Live.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Yeah, so maybe they're going to be kind of doing something like that.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
It seems like the way that they would go, but they're trying to maybe new content, which would be cool.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I'm all for new content, especially if it's not any additional cost to me.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Well, I think we've known for a while that they're toying with the idea of doing like a Microsoft channel type of thing on Xbox.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Or at least, you know, I don't know, more of that interactive kind of television style content.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Although it does seem weird that why would they close inside Xbox only to develop that kind of stuff?

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
That's the weird part.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I don't know.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000
But I do think definitely something is in the works there.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Is that something that interests you, Loki?

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Like I said, if it's at no additional cost to me, because I don't really have, I don't pay for cable TV right now.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.000
But I do pay for Xbox Live Gold, so it'd be nice if that was included with it.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I'd probably watch some stuff on there.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Alright, going to a service called PlayCast.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.000
PlayCast is an Israel-based company, and they're a cloud gaming service.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
You can think similar to OnLive.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:05.000
PlayCast is live in Portugal, France, and South Korea, which is weird because they're Israel-based, but they're in these other countries.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000
But they are supposed to be launching the service in the United States early next year.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
It's a cloud service.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:19.000
It streams through set-top boxes, tablets, smartphones, and PCs, anything that can run Android 4.0 and higher.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000
You do a subscription package that's tailored to a user.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Kind of interesting.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So like, in the service in France right now, there's a package that's more tailored to casual gamers, and then one that's tailored at the more hardcore.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000
So it's kind of like you would, I guess since we're talking about TVs and channels, you'd be buying, like Comcast, right?

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:46.000
When you sign up for their service, you can get like the sports channel package, or the, you know, entertainment channel package, or whatever, movie channels.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So kind of taking that idea to cloud gaming service.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Interesting. Interesting.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000
PlayCast is aiming towards what they call the mid-core market, a group that enjoys gaming but isn't going online in their favorite shooter every day.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So maybe not the type of people that listen to this show, but people that still enjoy gaming.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Apparently, if you use multiple devices, so like let's say you play on your TV through a PC, and then you can now use your phone or tablet as a controller.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000
PlayCast will instantly recognize the activity when you sign in with the auxiliary device.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:30.000
You can create your own skins with the tablet or what have you, and customize the look and layout of the interface.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:45.000
No word on exactly when this launches in the U.S. Of course, nothing on subscription prices, but it should be noted that PlayCast does have deals with Activision, Warner Brothers, Telltale, THQ, Codemasters, and these other countries.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
They are also trying to get indies on board.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Consumer Electronics Show may bring us more information when that occurs January 8th through the 11th in Vegas.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Interesting.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I don't know, I'm not super big on these cloud gaming things, and I'm more of the type of gamer where it's like, I'll just buy the games I want to play.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:14.000
But I can see the idea of, you know, go after the audience that maybe isn't as hardcore as I am.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I just don't want to put stuff that I'm paying for in somebody else's hands.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Yeah. It depends on the price though. If it were super cheap, it might be awesome. But I kind of doubt it's going to be that cheap.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Dark Sakura.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Well here is a big rumor. Now, have you ever heard of Idolmaster?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Yes I have.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Well, there is a...

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I've been reading Japanese release dates for how long on this show? Yes, I've heard of Idolmaster.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Rob, it's called leading into a story. Hello.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Okay, my bad.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Well anyway, Namco Bandai registered two different trademarks in Europe. One of them is the Idolmaster and the other is Shiny Festa.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Which is one of the titles of a recent Idolmaster spinoff that's on the PSP.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:08.000
So maybe we'll be getting Idolmaster. I mean, that looks like they're going to Europe first.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.000
But I honestly think that if they did it there, they'd do it here. Don't you think?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:23.000
And really what this is, the Idolmaster games, you basically manage a pop star's career. Sort of like a Tamagotchi game.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Shiny Festa is just a rhythm game that sort of follows after Project D.Va.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Do you have to clean up their poop too? Like Tamagotchi? No.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
You have not taken a bath. Go bathe.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Okay.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Bathe is slower.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Rub.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And hence.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Anyway. So yeah, it could get localized.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Alrighty, well we'll see. I mean, I don't know. Trademark may just be preventing another company from coming in and releasing their own game called Idolmaster.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:11.000
But I don't know. You would think there'd be an audience for it here. It's not going to be a huge thing like it is over there.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But there's certainly enough people that are into the Japanese culture alone that would want to check it out just because it's been so big over there.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
It could be a cult game, I think is what they'd call it.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Who knows? I mean, we've seen other things happen. You know, games like that gain popularity.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I mean, would we have had Elite Beat agents otherwise?

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
That'd be neat. I don't know. Not my thing.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:43.000
So this is kind of funny. We were talking a little bit about Killer Instinct and boob flashing, so that's awesome.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:49.000
But this may stop another Killer Instinct game coming out.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Apparently Microsoft at least tried to renew the trademark of Killer Instinct, but it's been rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the basis of likelihood of confusion.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Apparently this has to do with a short-lived Fox show called Killer Instinct from 1995.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Because I know everybody that you talk about Killer Instinct thinks of the Fox show and not, I don't know, the fighting game series.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
I've never heard of that show.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Somebody at the Trademark Office did.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Yeah, a really obscure person that probably, you know, that's my favorite show!

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Same person probably also has episodes of Silk Stockings on tape.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Hey, Silk Stockings was awesome.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
That was some good skinimax right there.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Anyways, and David Duchovny, you rock on.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Anyways, so basically said that, you know, they're probably going to be trying to, I guess, maybe appeal that or something.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
I don't know.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Right now they said this happens to a lot of trademark applications and by no means is the final say on the application.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
It just means that Microsoft has to provide more evidence to overcome their objection.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I would say, you know, ask the average person on three.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:12.000
So, Killer Instinct, is that an arcade game or a show from 1995?

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I'm going to be like, what?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I'm looking at some clips of Killer Instinct here on, I'm thinking this is the intro to the show or whatever, here on good old YouTube.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
But yeah, this is the movie for dialogue.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Who doesn't star?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Marguerite Moreau.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000
I don't...

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
That's a lot of nothing.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I miss her too.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000
That's totally...

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
What? They're making a game based...

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
They don't even talk.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
They're making a game based on my favorite show from 1995.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
That's fantastic.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
2005, actually.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Just so you know.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
It said 1995.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
No, it's 2005, that one that I'm looking at there.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
It's 2005.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Oh really?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Yeah.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
It's wrong.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.000
But anyway, the game was 95, wasn't it?

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Maybe.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Yeah, it was because I was in college in Alabama.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Anyway.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Kicking people's asses.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Anyway, it's not that they make games based off of shows.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Like CSI has games.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Survivor has games that aren't very good.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Wheel of Fortune, you just said, has a game coming out next week.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
So surely Killer Instinct, a canceled show from 8 years ago.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
It was 2005.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
My mistake, not 1995.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Surely a canceled series from 7 years ago might have a game at some point.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
So therefore...

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I know.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Considering that it ran a whole, what, 13 episodes?

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Wow.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
People would totally...

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
No, I'm sorry.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Not even 13 episodes because 4 of those episodes were unaired.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
So, uh...

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.000
According to GameGuru, sounds like your typical canceled Fox show.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Yes.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
So 9 episodes.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Yeah, people are gonna totally confuse it for that piece of shit.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I'm sure, you know.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:09.000
We would get a Wonder Falls video game before we would get a Killer Instinct video game based off the show.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I'm pretty sure this will be appealing.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Oh my god.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
You know what this sounds like?

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
This sounds like a really crappy ripoff of Law and Order SVU.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
It probably is.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
They're part of the, get this, the Deviant Crimes Unit.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
The DCU.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Yeah.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
The DCU.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Totally not a ripoff of the SVU.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Well, it just goes to show that, you know, intellectual property laws in this country are kind of borked.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I mean, just...

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I mean, technically, by the same logic, this show shouldn't have existed in the first place because of the game.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
We were talking about Gunsmoke earlier.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.000
That game was actually called Gun.Smoke because of the TV show.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
But come on, everybody called it Gunsmoke.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And, you know, if you're talking in the context of a game, you know the game.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
And if you're talking about television, classic TV, you know the show.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Like, you just, you just know.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Anyway.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Chief McBride was in it. He's awesome.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Who?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Chief McBride.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Oh.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000
The guy from Pushing Daisies.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
It was like her mentor or whatever.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I didn't know that.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Oddly enough, some Mega Man news this week.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
In light of the 25th anniversary, a couple things, believe it or not.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
An 8-bit fan game had a little preview this week.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
The Mega Man 25th anniversary.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
This is a Canadian-based group, Team Reverbot.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:43.000
But it's kind of a Voltron of various, you know, people here.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000
You have Julian Spillane from DHX Media or Silicon Knights.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Jason Kanam from Drinkbox Studios.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Ori Falconer and Daniel Ochoa from Vast Studios.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And Tim McLennan from Gameloft.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
And then an independent artist, Jeff Kanam.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
So this is, you know, again, it's kind of your basic NES throwback.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
But with, like, all new bosses.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And I can play a little preview here.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000
You know, it's not all that different from Mega Man 9 and 10.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Because people seem to love their retro Mega Mans.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
But, like, see, that guy actually shoots acid.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Which is in line with the theme stage here.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
They even have all new bosses, right?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Like, there's actually Sledge Man, Bio Man, Tarot Man.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Kendo Man, Amp Man, Neon Man, Comet Man, and Totem Man.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Are all the new little bosses there.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
If this little clip of the boss select screen is to be believed.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Interesting.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Actually, one of my friends in Japan just was posting something from Cap Community related to Mega Man.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I think it might be this other thing, probably, that I'm about to mention.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
The Street Fighter X Mega Man.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Actually, yes.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Yes, that's what it is.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
This was also something that was announced.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000
This is a little more official.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
That other one was more of a, like, indie whatever.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
This is a little more official.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Sort of, though.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
The interesting thing about this.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000
This project, the Street Fighter X Mega Man, has been going on for a while.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And you can find the guy's YouTube channel and find these old concept videos from, like, three years ago.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
So this has been being worked on for quite some time.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
At some point, Capcom caught wind of it.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Because now Capcom is going to be the ones that are sending it out through their Unity blog.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
The Capcom Unity blog.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And they're going to make it a free download on December 17th, 2012.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:40.000
You know, for all the shit that Capcom gets for pissing off their fanbase over the past year,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:46.000
this is a very interesting kind of band-aid to try and make it right with the community.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Because, you know, they see this indie project's going on.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And for all practical purposes, they have every right to shut the damn thing down.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:58.000
But they've learned from watching what happens to other stuff when that goes on,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
that this is going to get out there to the internet anyway.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:06.000
So let's embrace it, give the guy a little guidance, and then, you know, give it out as a goodwill thing for free,

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
and end up giving the guy some exposure.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
And it looks kind of neat.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.000
It kind of does the whole parody of, like, Mega Man 2 here in the intro, but...

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
You can see, like, Ryu's stage.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
It even does these interesting things where, like, the bosses have, because they're Street Fighter characters,

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
have, like, super meters.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
The bosses have, like, super meters.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And once they fill up, it'll do, like, this little zoom in, and they do their super attack.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
It's kind of funny.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I was watching some of the old concept videos online, so...

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.000
It's really neat that it came to life.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.000
I kind of wonder if the guy got any help officially from Capcom, or what.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I don't know.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Well, you can get it free on December 17th.

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000
By the way, the super fan behind this, Sonic, is the name he uses online.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Xiao Zong Hui.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
He's a pro-competitive gamer, additionally.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Very cool.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Yay, I love this music.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Filled, uh, end of game music.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
You know, um, Brentlefloss did lyrics to it.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Of course.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Anyway.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Anyway.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I love looking at the little chibi Street Fighter characters done up in Mega Man style.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I think that's awesome.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
So.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Alright.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Going back to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
GameGuru commented on that last story about Killer Instinct,

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.000
saying that the TV show came out right as Nintendo let that Killer Instinct trademark expire.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
So, a small correction to me getting angry there a minute ago.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Good to know.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat, talking on this Capcom Mega Man thing, says,

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Yeah, the way Capcom handled that made me even more interested in checking it out.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I'm always down for more retro Mega Man.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Panaxium in chat says,

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I'd play it if my reflexes weren't shit.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
I'm getting old.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Yeah, you and me both.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Hopefully there's an easy mode.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Like Mega Man 2 style easy mode.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Alright, more news.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Dark Sakura.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
News?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Oh, I'm sorry, we're to the mailbag.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Yeah!

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Well, the news is, you all emailed us, and now we're gonna give you answers.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Fucking hell.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Mailbag at Orangelandrado.com.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Again, that's mailbag at Orangelandrado.com.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Dark Sakura's gonna dive in the mailbag head first, and pick out a few emails.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.000
And, we were actually kind of, like, some weeks we get no emails whatsoever.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
This week, we got a bunch.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
All the emails.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
All the emails.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
So, Dark Sakura I think can only read some tonight, but she's gonna pick some and read them.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I'll go through them.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Goodie.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Surtur here.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
What are the good games?

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
I don't know.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
What are the good games?

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Is that the whole sentence?

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
No.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Oh.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I like JRPGs.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I have Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, and Animal Crossing Wild World.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Which, I guess that isn't really a JRPG.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
It's more of a kind of a sim, I guess.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
What are other good games?

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
What do you think if the world ends with you?

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Love the show.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I'm gonna guess he left out a sentence for the DS.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Because all those games he named are DS games, right?

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I guess.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.000
So, what are good DS games?

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Dan likes Fire Emblem.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I mean, that's more of a strategy RPG.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Um, you know what game is surprisingly good?

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Is the Cardhouse one.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
The 30, the Clubhouse games.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
That's what it is.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Clubhouse games is really good.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Maybe he's looking specifically for JRPGs.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I mean, you could play Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Yeah, the Final Fantasy IV, III, and IV remakes are really good on DS.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
By the way, side story.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Did you hear about Final Fantasy IV is getting its iOS release like Final Fantasy III did?

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Good.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Final Fantasy IV is gonna be coming out for what?

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Android and iPad and iPhone and all that stuff?

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Android, meh.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Hey, I'm just saying.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
It's coming out for all those systems before the end of the year, I think.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
At least in Japan.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Next email.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Howdy, OLR.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
It's your favorite catastrophic magi.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Unfortunately, this week I come bearing sad news.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Unlike every other time I've emailed recently

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
where I bitch about release dates for certain games, or lack thereof.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I'm sure the name will mean little to you, but earlier today, Sir Patrick Moore

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I know who that is, by the way

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
passed away at the age of 89.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
He was best known as an astronomer and the host of the long-running BBC TV show, The Sky at Night.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
How does this relate to gaming, though?

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Well, to gamers in the early 90s, he was also known as the Games Master

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
from a TV show of the same name, doling out tips and cheats every week

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
as well as challenges to contestants.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
And then he links a video to it going forward.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
The Games Master was the gaming TV show in the UK

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
in my far from humble opinion

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
and has never been bested, let alone equaled.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Goodbye, Games Master.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Total goodbye.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I never saw it, so I don't have that emotional attachment

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000
but I can imagine.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
I knew who he was as an astronomer.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Imagine the day when Mark Summers passes away.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
We are all going to have a cry.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
We're all going to throw green slime at you.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
You know what's funny about Mark Summers?

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
He was pathologically...

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Yeah, OCD.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Yeah, as far as things...

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
He hated dirty anything.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Hey, it was a job.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
By the way, going back to the DS email,

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Meteos is like my favorite DS game.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
It's a puzzler and it's great.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I have my plea appeal.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
It's not a JRPG, sorry, but Meteos is great.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I'm just saying it's a great game.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Since he left out a sentence in that email,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I'm just going to make up what it said.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Way to assume, Rob.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Yes, that's what I do.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Next up, hello, OLR crew.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
This is Rom...

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I'm going to butcher this.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Romaditya from Indonesia.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I think that's actually right.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
This email is probably rather personal

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
because we are fellow gamers.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I think that's all right for me to ask your blessings.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Yes, I just got married.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Congrats.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I write this email soon after the party is over.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
It's December the 9th.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Wait a minute.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
When the marriage and the celebration of the party is over,

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
don't email your favorite podcast.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Get to the baby makings.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Consummate.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I'm going to assume he meant after all of that.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I know that marriage is such a common thing,

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
but for me, it is special.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
What I mean is how it will make my gaming life special.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
As a blind person like me,

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
it is very difficult to enjoy video games.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
An 8-bit, 16-bit era were the only great memories

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I could remember.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
It is fortunate that my wife is also a gamer.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Even though she cannot play modern games very well,

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
she has the ability to translate what's on the screen

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
to my imagination.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000
So she agrees to help me re-enjoy my childhood memories.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Well, we decided to snatch an Atari 2600,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
sorry, NES, Genesis, and SNES.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
We will start by playing the simple games

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
like Galaxian or Pac-Man

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
and continue to Super Mario Brothers.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
The way I will play the game is like this.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
She will explain to me what to do,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
and I will play it with my game and the controller.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000
For example, go left, don't go right, et cetera.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
That way, for instance, I can still play Galaxian and so on.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Our best collaboration was when we finished Contra

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
with 30 lives code.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Well, that's all for now.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I hope this little story can inspire other people,

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
even with disabilities,

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
that they can still enjoy video games.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000
PS, we'll send you real-time video of how I play games.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000
PPS, this is a little pic for my marriage party.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Oh, I'm going to look at it.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I tried to look at it.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
It was blocked on Facebook.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Yeah, it's blocked. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000
We would love to enjoy your photo.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I think that story is so cute, though.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000
It is.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I mean, it's just, that's great.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.000
I love that story. I do.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:43.000
You and Dan, you told me you guys kind of do something similar, too,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
in your relationship.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.000
You're not facing a disability on the severity of blindness.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I faced motion sickness.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Well, yeah, that's a thing.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
And your ergonomic thing with your hand.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Well, this was before my hand.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Okay.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
But we would play Resident Evil 2,

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
and I'd welcome through the game with the strategy guide.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I mean, because I couldn't watch the screen all the time.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I'd get a little motion sick.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000
But it's something we would do together.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Okay, so moving forward.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Alan and I level characters in Warcraft together.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
At least we did.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
We did his first character.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
What about our paladins?

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Our paladin pals?

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
You and I aren't in a relationship.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
No, I'm just kidding.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Our paladin pals were fun.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
They can be friends.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Shane and I have leveled, like, at least three characters together.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
It's a fun friend thing to do, too.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I need someone to finish leveling.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
We just set a time, and we'll do it.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Help me level my stupid troll.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
God, anyway.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Wait, Loki, do you and Nellie do any bonding thing?

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Oh, please.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Come on.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
You play the game, and she mocks you.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
I wonder if she's asking in the night.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:51.000
She's like, I don't know, like, what are you doing?

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I'm hunting dingos.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Did they eat your baby?

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I don't know.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
They try to attack you, and then you skin them.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:02.000
For the record, the challenge is still out there.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I will still play Minecraft if someone buys it for me.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Just saying.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Oh, it is haunted.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I was going to say, Christmas is coming up, but actually,

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
your holiday is going on right now, so oops.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I don't really care.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I know.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Hey, gang.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I just thought I would drop a line and say hey.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Hey.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Hey.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I watched the VGAs last night, and I must say I was very impressed

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
with the Game of the Year winner.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I just finished The Walking Dead about two weeks ago.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.000
I found myself finishing an episode, or sitting in my office and pondering

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
whether the decisions I made were the right ones.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
And that's when you know you've played a great game.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.000
So good work, Telltale, for beating the Call of Duty's Borderlands

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
and all the other big-name AAA games.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.000
It goes to show what you, I guess that means what you can do.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:46.000
If you take an old-school remedy and modernize it a tad,

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.000
it can be video game gold.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I also wanted to ask Loki, knowing that you're a big GTA fan,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I was wondering if you ever played Sleeping Dogs.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Yes, I have played Sleeping Dogs.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I just started playing after picking it up on the Steam Thanksgiving sale,

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
and I'm pretty blown away.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
I didn't have a very high expectation when I started it,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
yet I am having a blast playing it.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
So check it out if you haven't, and if you have, what did you think?

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000
I thought it was pretty fun, although I got bored of it pretty quick.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Moved on to other things.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Now everyone stop what you're doing, and it should be Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E,

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000
not Y-O-U-R. I will correct everyone who does this.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Grammar lessons with dark soccer.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
You know what? It's stupid.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
You learn this when you're in second grade. I mean, jeez.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Just blame autocorrect.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:38.000
No, I'm not blaming autocorrect. I'm blaming people being lazy.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Where was I?

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000
And if you haven't yet, go play The Walking Dead.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Oh, one more thing, after I complete Dogs That Aren't Awake,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
I'm going to pick up Far Cry 3.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I wasn't a fan of 2, though. I have it on PS3 and Steam.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Just didn't find it appealing, so if any of you have played 2 or 3,

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
your thoughts are 4 for 4.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Keep up the good work, Travis.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
That's a low-key question as far as Far Cry goes.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I didn't play Far Cry.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Walking Dead, I'm making it a point.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I will play that before the end of the year.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I'm not going to name a game of the year until I've at least played that,

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
because that's what everybody really seems to be into.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.000
I'm making it a point to play more Mass Effect 3.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
That's a pretty dull point.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
You know what?

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Yeah, go ahead.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I have a butt bite it.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Yes, low-key.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Far Cry 3 is awesome.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
What about 2?

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.000
2, I didn't play, because the same reason why I didn't like Dead Rising,

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
you have malaria in the game.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000
So you have to constantly give yourself medication bullshit like that.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I don't like that.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Dead Rising 2 sucked, because of that crap.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
And then I got Dead Rising 2 off the record, and I'm like,

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Oh, sweet.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000
I'm not going to worry about the stupid having to get medicine for a stupid girl.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Oh, but then guess what, Frank West, he has the problem,

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
and he needs to get the fucking Zombrex for himself.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I'm like, gone.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Get rid of this game, because it's absolute shit.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
So no, I do not enjoy games that you have malaria in.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
But Far Cry 3 is awesome, because you do not have malaria in that.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Malaria-free games are awesome.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Exactly.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I should call in sick to work with malaria.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Sorry, Mosquito bit me, even though they're in larval stage right now.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Hey, guys, I'm a new listener, and I've got to say that you guys have one awesome show.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Thank you.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Well, thanks.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I've only been listening for a few weeks,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
and I already feel like you guys are close friends that I've known forever.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Yay.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:36.000
I've had very similar problems, and in my life, I've been having headaches.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Stripes just passed away, I'm sorry.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Aw.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And he always laid in my lap while I played Minecraft and Xbox,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000
but the point is that you have a great way to make the show feel like a great chat with friends

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and keep up the good work.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
That was our goal.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Yes.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Mission accomplished.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Mission accomplished.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Thank you for validating exactly what we sent out to do.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:03.000
We wanted this podcast to be exactly what dinner after playing DDR at the arcade for a night was,

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:09.000
which was just sitting around talking some smack, having a good time, being bros, right, Jamie?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Yeah, brofist.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Brofist.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Dude, bros.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:19.000
You know, every time you say that, though, I think of John's wow character, bro dude.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.000
And I almost made, like, girl chick just to be funny.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
You should have.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I should have, but no one's ever on that server.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
But anyhow, thank you for validating what we're trying to do.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Yes.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Appreciate it.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Thanks.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Fried bologna hole.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Is that what he called it?

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Yeah.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Equating it to wow.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000
He completely missed the fact that while is always updating and adding new things to the game.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Do you think that anything resembling logic runs through his brain before he opens his fried bologna hole without comparing COD to other games?

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Do you think they have a right or should charge for online play?

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Fun fact.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I don't play either COD or wow as I hate them both.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Games do charge for online play.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Have you missed the online pass train?

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Did you forget about that?

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
That was the thing.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
What was he talking about?

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Games charging for online play?

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Apparently.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Read the first part of the email again.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Equating it to wow.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Well, I agree with that in one state.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Only one reason.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I think if they went throughout where, because a lot of people just buy it for the multiplayer.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:48.000
In which case, if they sold it like killer, not killer instinct, but kill zone where they have the multiplayer version that you can buy for 15 bucks.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
That portion of the game and that's all you get.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
That might be worth it.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
They could probably charge for multiplayer that way and sell maybe some more copies.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:10.000
But as of right now, just because they're down by half a million copies, they sold over 7 million copies in the first month.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I don't say that's a failure of a game.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Yeah, okay, it's a little less than last year, but that is way better than 99% of the games sold right now.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I mean, they break their, the only reason they, I guess what, they didn't surpass the last year and the year before last records.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
But come on, it's not gonna always increase.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000
8 million copies sold is just ridiculous.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
You don't charge to play online when you're already charging to play online on the Xbox.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
That's what Xbox Gold is.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000
I'm telling you, the minute I get double dipped for this shit, my Xbox is going for sale on eBay.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I'll even autograph it.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
And hey, hey.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
It's gone.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
I don't want Xbox anymore if I start getting double dipped.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Hey, dipshit Michael Patcher, they already charge for playing Call of Duty Online.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:02.000
There is a Hong Kong version, or Chinese or Hong Kong version of Call of Duty, Call of Duty Online, which is an MMO.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
You charge to play online.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
So, they've already done that.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Some comments from our chat room.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Raginator says, Patcher should just blow it out his fried bologna hole.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.000
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, I think his mouth resembles more like Wanda's macaroni salad.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Oh, I see what you did there.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Alright, moving on.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Is that the right word?

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Oh, no.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Is there more email?

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000
No.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Yeah, there is, but there was more to that one.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Yes.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
It says, good day citizens, serious turtle.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Oh.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
And this is the last email that matters.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
I'm kidding.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:51.000
I'm sure achievements and trophies aren't such a big thing for you guys, but do you sort of wish Steam's achievements added up to an overall gamer score as with Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network, or even iOS slash Mac Game Center?

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000
And that comes from Robert M.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.000
It'd be okay, but it's not a deal breaker. I don't really care.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Like, are we talking like a unified achievement system?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:10.000
That's kind of what the website Raptor tries to do a little bit. R.A.P.T.R. I think it's spelled.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
That's kind of what they're trying to do with their site.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000
I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but they try to track all your gaming.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000
It didn't track my game progress in Grand Theft Auto 4.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Although I know it's retroactive, but like I played the fuck out of Grand Theft Auto 4 and it says I haven't played it at all.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Was that on 360 or?

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Yes.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.000
That's weird because it picks up all my Mass Effect activity and all that stuff.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Yeah, but stuff that you'd played before you joined Raptor or during?

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Oh, I thought I picked up the befores. Not the hours. It doesn't pick up the hours from before.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Oh, it should have because I played the fuck out of that.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I'll tell you what, I hate the crap out of Origin.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
I do too.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Which is why I always at least run my Mass Effect 3 through Steam so that it'll pop up through Steam and then Origin.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000
I'm not sure there's a way to really unify all that though, unfortunately.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Like, sorry to the emailer, but I think some people are trying to create online.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:05.000
I've heard of a gaming social network, and I can't remember the name, that I think is aspiring to do something very similar as well.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:11.000
So you have these different startups that are kind of competing to fill that void of, you know, your universal gaming badge.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000
But nobody's really cracked into the mainstream yet.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:19.000
I mean, Raptor's probably the biggest one I can think of, but they're not a Twitter, they're not a Facebook yet.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.000
They're still very, very niche, and I bet a lot of gamers still haven't heard of them.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Hitstun in chat says, Raptor's pretty nice, but there's plenty of stuff it doesn't track, like Minecraft with third-party launchers.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.000
And it tries to make you use their shitty web browser, but the stats are nice.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
So, there you have it.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Right, that's it.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
That's it, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you wish to send us emails in the future.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
This is the part of the show where we get angsty.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
All this is bad.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Here is justice.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Here is punishment.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Here.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
This is fucked up.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I actually can't really say anything about it.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.000
So, it's a blanket F you to a situation that I really can't do much about right now.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
That's it.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Loki.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
I figured it would be so expensive.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I'm actually looking at this real quickly going through Newegg to see if I could create one of those Alienware PCs that they have for cheaper than obviously they offer them.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And yeah, you probably can.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
But it's still expensive.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Um, F you to latkes.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Do you know how fat you've made me tonight?

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000
No.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Do you know how many hours on the treadmill I won't spend burning this off?

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
No.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Rob, potassium.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
I eat bananas.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Actually, potatoes have more potassium.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Really?

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I'm gonna find it for you.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
You gonna find me a study?

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
A scientific study?

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Alright, let's do a couple more news stories and then we'll go to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000
But not just yet, we do have a couple more stories for you guys.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Loki.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Yes, because you know Hitman has had its share of really bad marketing ideas and well, there's yet another one.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Apparently they had a Facebook promotion where you can do a hire Hitman app for Facebook.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:36.000
What it basically did was it allowed you to create these hits on different people and of course, you know, some of the reasons I guess.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Target identified by, and then there's a drop down box, reason for target elimination.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:51.000
So like some of the target identified by things are her small tits or her muffin top or her hairy legs or her ginger hair and that kind of stuff.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Some ridiculous things.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Apparently people took offense to that.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Oh, you think?

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Yeah.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Imagine that, Loki.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I can't possibly imagine how this could have possibly been offensive.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Putting a hit out on your friend because they have hairy legs and small tits.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I can't, I mean, the madness of it all.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:25.000
And I guess they also had, like I said, not only when you fill that thing out, I guess if your friend receives the app or whatever,

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:32.000
it says they were going to not only receive these death threats, but they were going to witness their full on hits,

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:39.000
including I guess their friend going through the process, flash pictures of their profile or something like that before their eyes, before they were killed.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:45.000
And then I guess when they are killed, it tells the reason why.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:53.000
You know, because Bob thought that your tits were small and that you were cheating on your partner or some garbage like that.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:02.000
And I guess, yeah, I guess people were kind of offended by that.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
And of course, we're sorry for any offense caused by this.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Like, where was the common sense when this was going through the testing process?

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Like, multiple people must have worked on this project.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Where was the, I don't know, validation by a human being?

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Like, was that just skipped? What happened there? How out of touch was this marketing department for real?

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Dark Sakura, imagine you woke up this week and imagine you go on Facebook and you check Facebook and you say,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:44.000
hey, and you see a little thing that says Rob Roberts has put out a hit on you because you're a bitch and you smell.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
How would you have responded to that?

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
I'm going to cut that hooker.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Cut that bitch.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Dark Sakura apparently approved the app, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
No, I don't. No, I don't.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
He would have been like...

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
I would cut a bitch though.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:08.000
You would have written a ten page paragraph about what bullshit that was as your status update.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.000
No, I wouldn't.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I just ask people to explain certain social conventions that I find baffling.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:24.000
SSJ100Matt says, the fact that Square Enix dropped this so quickly tells me it was mostly behind their ad agency.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Yeah, I would think so.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, I'm guessing the team involved had zero women on it or the few women they had were shut out or ignored.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Now, to be fair...

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
You mean like DC Comics?

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000
He's probably right, but just because I have to ask this because I want to know the full story.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Could I put a hit out on a man for having small tits and hairy legs?

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I think you could. I don't know if they would have those options. Maybe they might, you know...

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
You do have rather small boobs, Rob.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Maybe they would sort them out because of, you know, by gender and they might have different things.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.000
But, you know, a small penis.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Okay, right.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Maybe. I don't know.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Still not smart.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.000
They probably...

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Don't mishear me.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Because of his large penis.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
But I'm just, you know...

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I put out a hit on him because his penis is too large.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Do you know her? Her dick is so little. No.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Actually, I don't think it's even that necessarily it had zero women on it.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:36.000
It had zero people that, like, actually are in the demographic they're trying to target.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000
I think that's the biggest problem with things like this.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Is it's like, you know, like, you can just imagine all these old fuddy duddies sitting in a room talking about, you know, what's cool and what's hip and what the youngsters are into.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I'm hip. I'm cool.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:58.000
And it's like, if you had shown this to anybody in that, like, you would have been told.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
It's stupid.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
It's dumb.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Quite. Rob, quite.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Alright. Moving on.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Well, good on them shutting it down as fast as they did.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
But lesson learned.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Screen that shit before it goes live.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Just saying.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
This is interesting.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Have you ever heard of a VRC6 cartridge back in the days?

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
NES.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.000
VRC Memory Management Controller chip.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000
It was something that Konami had on Famicom cartridges.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:38.000
It would add three extra sound channels allowing for richer audio.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Here's an example.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Here's what Castlevania 3 sounds like in the U.S. in the NES.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
We all know that one, right?

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000
But here's what it sounded like on the Famicom because of the three extra sound channels.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
I love this version too.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Very different, huh?

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
You should hear how The Legend of Zelda sounds.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Did you know how many fucking games were dumbed down with the sound because of it?

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
This is really cool.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
A chiptune artist named RussJet1.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.000
We've had his stuff on the station before. I know this guy.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:22.000
He has used the VR6 chip to remake the Mega Man 3 soundtrack.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Now, Mega Man 3 was already fucking awesome, right?

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Okay, so here's an example.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Here's Magnet Man's original theme.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
This is the original.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
A good song. Remember that?

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Here is RussJet1's VR6 version.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
So it's a little bit remixed too.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
He didn't just take the original and overlay it.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
He just completely kind of redid it.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
So that's really cool.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.000
He actually played through Mega Man 3 with the audio silenced,

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000
laid his tunes on top of the game footage,

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.000
and then when he gets to Wily's Castle, it even goes through.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
So it's awesome, this whole little video that's out there.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Protoman's theme, everything is there.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000
So you can check that out at RussJet1.bandcamp.com,

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
where he distributes a lot of his stuff.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Very cool. Very cool.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Yeah, so, I mean, gosh, I want to go back and replay

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000
all these old games on a Famicom emulator

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
just to hear how awesome the sounds were.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
You really should hear the differences between

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
the different versions of The Legend of Zelda.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:54.000
It really is kind of night and day.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Well, let me open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
And while we wait for some calls,

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
let me see if I can bring that up here.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I think that you can find it.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
I mean, it's really just the fact that

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
there was a little bit different instrumentalization

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
on the two different ones, so...

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Let's see.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
You should look for the...

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000
The disc version.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Yeah, this is the disc version.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Hmm.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
It's going through the title screen and all that stuff.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Yeah.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Well, some of this sounds normal.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Oh, yeah.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
I guess we have to get to, like, the dungeon.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Let me fast forward a little bit.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
But it's a lot richer.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Oh, yeah, you can even hear an extra little ding.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Let me see if we can get to the dungeon.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Here we go.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000
You hear the difference in the start?

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000
You hear the difference in the start?

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000
So it's mostly...

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
No, it's in the sound effects.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Oh, yeah, you can hear it in that.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000
But actually, if it had allowed to play through the intro,

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
it would have sounded different.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Let me go to the phones,

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.000
because we're getting some calls.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Who's this?

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Hi, it's Panaxium.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Hey, another video caller.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
What's up, Panaxium?

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Hey.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Hi, you can't see me, but I'm waving.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
What's up?

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Rob, you're a special, special person.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I know, I know.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:23.000
I was actually calling to see if you guys had heard of Starbound.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Starbound.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Is this like...

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000
This has to be like an Earthbound fan sequel, right?

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Actually, no, it's the spiritual successor to Terraria.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Really?

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Okay.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.000
No, tell me about it.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Tell me more.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.000
It's actually going to be very sci-fi.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
So you're going to be able to visit other planets and stuff,

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
and each planet's going to have different ecosystems

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
and monsters and things like that.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
So far, it looks like it's going to be really cool.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
I love Terraria.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I don't know if you guys had a chance to try it.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I have tried it.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I prefer Minecraft, I've got to say.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Terraria really did not tell me what to do.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I tried to get into it and could not.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Yeah, but I went back and played it after I enjoyed Minecraft,

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
and I was like, all right, I see why people get into this,

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:07.000
because it's like if Minecraft were on the Super Nintendo,

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
this is what it would be.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
And that was pretty cool.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Yeah, pretty much.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
And the new ones, they have the graphics,

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
they have the variety of things you can get and do

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
and different races you can play as, and it seems really cool.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Is it by the same people who did the original Terraria?

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Yeah, it's the same group.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
They've expanded it, though.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000
There's more people working on it.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Oh, nice.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Well, I'm glad the first game worked out so well for them

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
that they can actually do a sequel.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
That's got to be good.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
And it actually led me to a question,

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
and I thought I'd kind of pass it along to you guys

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
to get your opinion.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Do you think that this will ever move from being an indie-type game

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.000
with Minecraft and Terraria towards being a big project?

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Anything's possible in this day and age.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.000
You see things like the Gianna Sisters game

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
started as a project greenlight thing,

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
and now it's an Xbox Live Arcade.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000
I suppose a lot of it is, what do the developers want?

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
What are they kind of willing to do?

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Sometimes people don't really want to play by the rules

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
that systems like Xbox Live and so forth might set out.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I think we've all heard the stories before

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
about the patching on Xbox Live

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
and how it costs all this money

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
if you want to do a patch beyond the first one,

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
and it's really turned some people off.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
They won't patch Fez because of it, right?

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:31.000
That's a whole big thing behind it.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Now, Nintendo's changing that up a little bit.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
We reported on that a couple weeks ago.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
We have yet to see the impact of that, if it works,

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.000
but Nintendo's really trying to woo the indies towards Wii U

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
by not charging a fee for any of that stuff,

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:49.000
so it could be very interesting to see where they'll end up.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I guess at the end of the day, it just depends.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Do they think they can create the gaming experience

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
they want on those systems?

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I don't know.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I seem to remember Terraria made pretty good use of the keyboard,

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:09.000
so maybe they're worried about putting the controller into that environment.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I don't know.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
It's a risk worth taking,

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:22.000
but they have to decide if financially it's one that they'll get the downloads from.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.000
But if the community demands it, you never know what might happen.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Those cooperative collaboration games

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
where you're building and exploring together,

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
those are my kind of game. I always liked them,

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000
so I'm hoping that they get more exposure and more games made in that style.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:41.000
That's the type of stuff that seems to really do well on Xbox Live indie games, too,

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
is all the Minecraft clones.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
You look at the top games,

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:48.000
half of them are Minecraft clones. It's crazy.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Yeah.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Well, that's what I had called about and just wanted to call in and say hi.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Well, hello, and thank you for alerting us to a game we ought to be keeping our eyes on.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Yeah, I'll go ahead and post the link to their website in the chat.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Awesome.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.000
All right.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy. Take care.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Panaxium, everybody, on our Skype line.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:19.000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
I'm looking up Link to the Past right now.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Oh, wait. No, Link to the Past is the Super Nintendo one.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000
That would have been different.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
What was the Adventures of Link?

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
It was the second game of Link.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Live Radio, boys and girls.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Here we go.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
The Adventure of Link title.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Yeah.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Oh, wow. Even the little...

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
That does...

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000
That sounds different, too.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.000
See, I always knew the Famicom game sounded different.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
I knew about this chip and all that stuff, you know, just keeping my finger on the gaming community pulse

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000
as long as I have been.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
You knew about this stuff.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
I never really sat down and took the time to listen to some of this stuff.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
That's awesome.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Pass order.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
That's awesome.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
It's the one and only Rama.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Hey, Rama. What's up, buddy?

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I just want you to know, for the first time in the history of calling this show,

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:26.000
you guys have derailed me from what I wanted to talk about.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Uh-oh.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
What?

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
RushJet1.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
After hearing that music, I went straight to the Googles.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000
It's pretty awesome, isn't it?

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
You have no idea, especially with the fact I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
I'll be filling this up on my phone tonight.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
He's good, too.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
He's got a lot of stuff.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000
There's a track that I think we have in rotation on VoG, actually.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
It was on the old Orange, because I went through the old OrangeLoungeRadio files

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
and we were putting together VoG's initial playlist.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Obviously, we want a mixture of geek stuff as well as the video game stuff in there.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
But we actually had...

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Oh, shit. Now that I'm talking about it, of course, I can't find it.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.000
But we actually had in there a track that was called...

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
I think it was Konomized, was the name of the song.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
I'm going to see if I can find it while we're talking here.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
I'll play a little clip of it, but it was awesome.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:19.000
By the way, Jason also suggested finding the Hyrule Castle Famicom version from Zelda 2.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Oh, I've heard that one. It is phenomenal.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Yeah. That's pretty amazing.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I don't even like Zelda 2 that much, but I love the music in it.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Actually, Zelda 2 is my favorite one, because believe it or not, that was the first Zelda game I ever played.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Wow.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.000
The first one for me was the first one, but I just didn't like the side-scrolling aspect.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000
I mean, I'm not going to whine because it was hard, because the game was really freaking hard.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000
But it was just the style. It just didn't seem quite right.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And it also looked like Link was stabbing people with his cock.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
The downward thrust.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Come on.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000
I was in puberty. I knew what those were.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Just a second.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.000
So what else did you call in to talk about tonight? Just Rush Jett or...?

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000
No, no. I was out earlier, so I missed half the show. I apologize. I apologize.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Shame on you. It's fine. It happens.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I just want two quick things. Did you hear about what's happening to G4?

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
The Esquire thing? Yeah.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.000
You might have missed it when we were talking about it, but another podcast, The Nerdist with Chris Hardwick,

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Alan informed me that they were talking about that it's actually like Brovo, is what the network's basically going to be.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:36.000
And we were coming up with a joke, The Real Dude Bros of Orange County might be a show.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Sounds like Hipster Spike TV.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Yes. What do you think the Esquire channel will end up being?

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:53.000
I don't know. I don't think I want to know. It'll be funny nonetheless to see the end results.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Here's the other question. Do you care?

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:57.000
No, not really.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Here's that song, by the way, that's in rotation on VOG. I found it.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:16.000
It's using a lot of the sound effects you hear from Konami cartridges and kind of their sound palettes, so it's pretty awesome.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Anyhow, that's Konamiized by Rush Jet, and I'm sure that's on his bandcamp site as well.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Good stuff, huh, Rama?

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Oh yeah, and I found he has two albums on 8bitpeoples.com as well, so I'm definitely grabbing those.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.000
There you go, there you go. Alright, well, anything else on your mind tonight before I let you go, buddy?

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Yes. Have you heard of a convention called MagFest?

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
I've heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Is this about Mag the Game on Sony or no?

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000
No, it's a four-day gaming convention.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Oh, okay.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.000
All types of video games. And I'm checking the guest list. They have some interesting people here.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Let's just say there's somebody here where we may have to ship Dark Soccer over to DC for it.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Uh-oh.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Who's gonna pay for the ticket?

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
I have my ways.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Okay, what's the talent that's gonna be there?

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Well, a couple of names here we've heard on the show, like John St. John and Eric Ruth Games.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Yes, I definitely know John St. John, yep, yep.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:24.000
And since you mentioned Castlevania earlier, Kinuyo Yamashita, a composer for Castlevania.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Ooh.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Wow.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Nice.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
And, um, can I get a drumroll, please?

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Yuzo Koshiro.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Nice!

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Ooh.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I need to go. I'm a huge Yuzo Koshiro fan. That's awesome.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Well, we have one spot left in our room.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
When is it?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
First weekend of January.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Oh, that's like really soon. Oh my God.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:59.000
I can't do anything that weekend, because that's when my coworker is already out, so I can't take the same time off.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Well, that's okay, because my crew, we're gonna take care of you guys at MAGFest, so we are in line for press.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Awesome. SSG100Matt says MAGFest is amazing. Brental Floss has been there the last few years.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Yes, and also they also call this con drink fest. I don't think I have to explain why.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Can't imagine why.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Well, there's a reason why they're walking around with styrofoam containers.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Hopefully I make it out there for PAX East. We'll see. I'm still trying. I have to wait for them to open up the media registration to see if, you know, we can make that work.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Well, my entire staff, we got our badges in advance, then we're gonna apply for press, and if we get pressed, then we'll just pass the badges on to somebody else or whoever.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
There you go. There you go. Paying it forward.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Got that shit right.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Alright. Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Take care, man.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Alright, take care, buddy. Have fun at MAGFest.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Will do.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Yep. Yeah, and I've basically been told that basically, yes, I am being forced at gunpoint to go to Dragon Con next year, so that's like a thing.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000
I've been told if you want to go to PAX, you better go to PAX East, because you ain't going to PAX Prime.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Alright. Yes, sir.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.000
1877 GameOLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.000
So, yeah, if you're in the southeast part of the country, you might want to make plans on Dragon Con, because there's like a lot of vog stuff going on at Dragon Con next year.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000
That's all I can really say.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000
OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, 1877 GameOLR.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Loki, I can go to you for last minute stories, but I can also do the Twitter topics.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
I've got last minute stories if you want them.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Yeah, go for it.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to the PlayStation Network probably next week.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:49.000
It's dated for December 12th in Hong Kong, I believe. It's the English version there.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:58.000
However, it has been also confirmed on the Drop, which is the PlayStation Blog's little bit where they talk about stuff that's coming out.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.000
And next week, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas PS2 Classic.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:05.000
So, fantastic that that's going to be coming out.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Also, there's been some Linux system requirements popping up on Steam for some games that haven't really been announced yet.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Serious Sam BFE's Linux requirements have been on there, and also some more of the, I guess, a few Greenlight games as well.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:31.000
So, perhaps more evidence that they're really working towards that Steam version, or the Linux version of Steam for the Steam Box.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Be interesting. And then finally, the next Assassin's Creed is going to be in Brazil.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:48.000
And this has been actually confirmed, I guess GameSpot says they verified the translation that the next chapter is supposed to be held in Brazil.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:51.000
And this was coming from Ubisoft Brazil.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Imagine that.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Yes, that their next game is going to be there.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Obviously it'd be perfect for them to be working on it in some, you know, capacity.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
That's it.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Going to some Twitter topics.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Oh, sorry. One last thing real quick.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Again, 1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:20.000
As I mentioned on my Twitter this week, I am very disappointed to announce that Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable has been cancelled in the US.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
At least the retail release of it.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Now, that doesn't rule out that they could be doing a digital only version, which would make sense.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Because the Vita not doing so great, and a game that's kind of niched like Earth Defense Force may not sell very well as far as releasing it retail.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:43.000
DJ Max Technica just came out on Vita this week, and it's apparently easier to get on the digital store than it is to get a physical copy.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.000
I don't, yeah. So, that might be why.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
So, let's go to the phones, because you do have a call coming in.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Hey, this is Raginator.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Hey, Raginator. And look, another video.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.000
I like that the callers are actually listening to the request for more video.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
What's up, buddy?

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
No, not too much.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I just have a couple of questions for you.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Sure.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:20.000
First off, I know that ROMs are kind of a legal gray area.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:32.000
But in terms of the emulators, assuming that you have, let's say, Final Fantasy XII for the PS2, you actually own the game.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Are you allowed to use an emulator to play the game?

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:44.000
You're right. It's a gray area. And I'm gonna say up front, I am not a lawyer, so do not take legal advice from me.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:50.000
But my understanding is, you are entitled to make your own backup copy of a game that you own.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:58.000
So, if you make your own backup copy, and you use an emulator to play that backup copy, I believe you're okay.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:04.000
However, if you downloaded said copy from the internet, technically that's where you're in the legal gray area.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Are you gonna end up on Judge Judy and spend time behind bars because of it? Probably not. Probably not.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:20.000
But are you being 100% legal? You're a law-abiding citizen by every step of the way? Probably not.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:28.000
But I think ethically, if you wanna ask the ethical question, if you own the game, then yes.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:34.000
You should be able to have the emulator and do whatever crazy things you wanna do with the hacking and the so forth.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:40.000
You paid your money to support the developers and get the game and so forth. Have at you. Do what you want with it.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I think ethically, you're okay.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Yeah. I mean, I brought it up because I still have a lot of games on disk.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:53.000
I got a way around. Luckily, the things back in August did not scale everything.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.000
I still got my Final Fantasy trial and I've been dying to beat the game.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:02.000
That is the GameStop collector's edition too. I can even tell because it's the same one I have.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
The tin box? Yeah, I have that one too.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000
You can tell. That's what video allows me to do.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I've played it once.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
It's a good game. It really is.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:20.000
BlackWolf wanted to add to this conversation. He says it all depends on if you had to circumvent copy protection to make that ROM playable on the emulator.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:29.000
That's a DMCA violation. But again, legally, yeah, but ethically, I think you're okay.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Yeah, I just kind of figured if there was something out there that a program did, well, it mimicked the hardware.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:45.000
If I actually popped the disk into my computer's DVD drive, the original disk, basically turned my computer into a PS2,

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:52.000
I wasn't totally sure if it would be legal or not, so I don't want to get myself into trouble.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:55.000
I think you'll be fine. Nobody listens to this show. That's the good news.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:03.000
On the PlayStation 2, didn't you have that hard drive backup thing where you could load all the games to the drive and play them off the drive and it worked fine?

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Yeah, it was...

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.000
No, not you. I'm sorry. That was Loki, not you, Reginator. Sorry.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Yeah, there was the HD loader that they had.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Yeah, the HD loader. And, you know, if it's games you own, that's fine.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:19.000
But if you're renting games, dumping them and then shipping them back, that's ethically shame, shame, slap on the wrist.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Yeah.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
So, anyway, sorry, Reginator.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Yeah, well, I don't see, at least with what you were just talking about, you know, even then, how many games are going to put onto that PS2 hard drive?

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:46.000
It was only a 60 gigabyte hard drive, or scratch it out, 40 gigabytes, and the average PS2 game was about, let's say, no more than 8 gigs, so...

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:54.000
That's where you hack things to get the 500 gig hard drive to work, which you can also do on the Wii.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Now, one thing I kind of touched on over the past month or two is that now that I don't have any consoles anymore, thanks to thieves, I've been getting into PC games.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:23.000
And, you know, at least temporarily I've been using games for Windows Live in the marketplace, if only because I have a pre-existing account through Microsoft when I have my 360.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Sure.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Now, and I noticed that compared to, say, Xbox Live in their marketplace, there's hardly any, for lack of a better term, meaty games, like, let's say, the duels of playing Spockers games.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000
There's no Geometry Wars, no...

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
That's why it failed, sir.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.000
That's why it unfortunately has failed.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And, unfortunately, what you see there is probably all that's gonna be there, because now it's all about the Windows 8 marketplace is where the future focus is gonna be.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I think games for Windows is sadly a thing of the past.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
I could be wrong, you never know.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:15.000
I mean, if people will buy it, maybe they'll still put it there, but I think they're moving on to this whole Windows 8 marketplace is the future.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Sucks for those of us that are always a generation or two behind, just because that's where we have to be, right?

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Yeah, now, that being said, right now my computer has Windows 7 Home Premium installed, and now, would you recommend, based on what you know about Windows 8, would you recommend that upgrade to Windows 8 or stick with 7 Premium?

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I haven't used it, so it's hard for me to say. I couldn't say, yes, you should upgrade, but I'm not using it myself.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:56.000
I will tell you my hesitation is that I want to see how the compatibility looks with Windows 8 and kind of what the complaints are about it.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Also, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Yeah. Most of my friends that are using it, this is kind of the bottom line that I've heard from people that are using it right now.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:19.000
If you're on something before 7, then upgrade, but if you're on 7, eh, there's a few little perks, but it's not something you gotta get right now. It can wait.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Alright. Sounds good.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Alright, Rachel, I gotta let you go so we can wrap things up, but thank you so much for the call, and thank you for the video.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Sure, no problem.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Alright, bye-bye.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.000
Bye.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Thank you to all our callers for calling it.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:40.000
You know, now that we have the router and that the stream's not dropping, I think we need to get a studio cam back.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
I think that might be something we need to do.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
That way we can look at the listeners when they're calling.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Alright, um, that is not gonna do it just yet, because I need to get to the Twitter topics, but that is gonna do it for the Skype line.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
If you didn't get through, email us.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Retertainment tweeted us earlier and said,

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000
O-L-R, the Grammys ended with an award.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
The Emmys ended with an award.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
The Oscars ended an award.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.000
The VGAs ended with Tenacious D.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
What the fuck?

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
I'd say that's a good ending.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Unpopular opinion time.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:19.000
I think Tenacious D is super overrated.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
I don't think they're that good.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:22.000
That's...

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
I caused Jamie to choke, yay!

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
No, the latke caused me to choke.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:29.000
I know that's unpopular opinion, I'll get hate mail, I just...

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:33.000
For the record, when you reheat the latkes, do it on the stove.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Poor Jamie. Do you gonna be alright?

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Do you water?

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Okay.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.000
I don't need an ambulance to interrupt episode of Orange Lounge Radio either.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
We haven't had evacuation, we haven't had an ambulance.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
She's putting the hack in Hanukkah.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Alright, let's see, Tigerclaw sent us a story lead here.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Bronies shut down their My Little Pony MMO, blaming copyright law.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.000
You know what got shut down today, actually?

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.000
What?

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Two of the largest indexers for Usenet.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Do people still use Usenet?

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:19.000
For any legitimate purpose whatsoever?

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Hence why those sites are getting shut down.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.000
It's legit.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:28.000
I remember when Usenet was like, actually a...

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:32.000
It's legit. I mean, there's totally not pirated stuff on there.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.000
But yeah, NZB Matrix and NZB...

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Or Newsbin 2 got shut down.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Alright, so, back to the Brony story.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Some Brony developers were putting together My Little Pony online,

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:49.000
but a cease and desist came in from Hasbro,

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
but they pressed ahead.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:54.000
They said, screw it, and they moved forward,

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:57.000
and they released the game's first episode a month ago.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:04.000
However, Hasbro's lawyers sent down a shutdown demand to HLP online.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:08.000
The team put out a statement, it's very carefully worded,

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.000
not blaming Hasbro through the shutdown.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Quote, Hasbro is not to be blamed here, they wrote.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:17.000
As per US trademark law,

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
as soon as an infringement comes to light,

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.000
they are obligated to defend the trademark or they will lose it.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:26.000
They had no choice in the matter, regardless of what they thought the project

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
or how it benefited them.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
There was little we could do to work around it.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Discussions continued through the month, but it came down to one fact.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000
MLP online had to come to an end.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:39.000
So it's that whole... You know, we've heard this a couple times this year.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I remember the whole gamer thing.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Remember when Reddit got su...

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Not sued yet, but the cease and desist went to Reddit over the gamer thing,

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:52.000
where gamer.org had it, and then they said that Reddit had to stop using it.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
I don't know if that's really been resolved yet,

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.000
but the guy was like, hey, I have a trademark and I have to protect it.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:01.000
And a lot of people are like, why were you given that trademark in the first place?

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:05.000
Now, this is a little different because we can all understand

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:08.000
why Hasbro has a trademark on My Little Pony, but...

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Rama in chat, I know one of our resident bronies says,

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:19.000
I'm surprised that Hasbro sent a C&D due to all the episodes floating around on YouTube.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.000
Well, if Hasbro gets the magic button, those will all disappear real fast.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:26.000
And the people just talking about it.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Are there Watch Me Get High and Watch My Little Pony videos on YouTube?

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Like, reaction videos?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
I'm sure there are.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Jeez.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Never choke on a lot, good people.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Tigerclaw tweets us to an article about times lists of the year, gadget of the year.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:48.000
The Wii U, second place.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
First place for gadget of the year?

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Loki, you're gonna love this.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
iPhone 5.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Times gadget of the year.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
Those are tweets from Tigerclaw.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Lastly, from SSJ100, Matt.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:07.000
People say Lego City Undercover is like Lego Grand Theft Auto,

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:12.000
but someone made a Lego version of the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer,

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:13.000
and he links us to it. Have you seen this?

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:14.000
I saw it, yeah.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:15.000
What'd you think?

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:19.000
It was kind of disappointing because it was the first trailer and not the second one,

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:20.000
because the second one would have been really cool.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:24.000
But I mean, obviously that stop motion stuff takes a long time, so it's so cool.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:25.000
But yeah.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:31.000
But yes, Lego City Undercover, I swear to God, was at one time being worked on by Rockstar

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:34.000
because you see that first screenshot that they had?

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Same fucking HUD, same, like, everything as Grand Theft Auto.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.000
So I wouldn't be surprised at one time that that was the thing that Rockstar was working on with them,

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:46.000
but now it's, you know, Traveler Tales or whatever.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Whoever's putting it in, I think it's Traveler Tales.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:49.000
When is that coming out?

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
I don't think they have it.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
It's supposed to be launch window, so in the next three months?

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Could be anything.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Fuck, I mean, seriously, was it Wii Fit U now is the first half of next year instead of launch window?

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.000
And the rest of us all March.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:09.000
I mean, that, see, right there, that would have been probably the only, like, if I were to pick up a Wii U,

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:14.000
that would be the game I'd probably get, is that Lego City Undercover, because it actually looks pretty awesome.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:19.000
But that's really the only game that's been kind of impressive to me, is just that one.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Sorry for the dead air, I was just catching up on chat there.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
That is actually going to do it.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000
That was it for Twitter Topics.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
You said you were done with Last Minute Stories, right?

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:31.000
I believe I am.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.000
So that brings us to a close of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Sad.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:42.000
So, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we close up shop tonight.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:48.000
And my final thought, I'll start tonight, my final thought is F you to Jelly Beans, they're addicting too.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
What, guys?

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
And Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Check out the VoG Minecraft server if you haven't yet.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:04.000
There's information in our forums on how to sign up, basically just say, hey, I want to sign up,

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.000
put your username on there, and I add you to the white list.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Because now we have, you know, Mob Arena, it's kind of fun just to battle monsters, and it's really fucking hard.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:16.000
So, definitely worth trying it.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:21.000
And just because I want to see more than, like, one person on there at a time, because it's pretty sad.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.000
There's, like, it's a ghost town, so we need more people on there.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
And I don't know how to get more people to come.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
You need to plan a night.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:31.000
I know, I know.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:34.000
I'm here, and everybody converge this night.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:37.000
And I will try to drop in if it's not like when we take the courthouse or something.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Well, I think if I get the mob, because I'm still working on the Mob Arena stuff,

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:47.000
I think once I get that done, or it's actually, you know, somewhat, they have some usable classes,

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:51.000
because we're still tweaking the classes, because some of them don't make any sense or don't work right.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:55.000
So, once I'm done tweaking that and the waves and stuff like that,

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:58.000
because we had a problem at one time where it was just creepers spawning.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:04.000
It was just tons of fucking creepers, and, like, literally you would see, you'd be watching the, you know,

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.000
up top, and I'd have, like, they have different waves.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:12.000
They have one called a swarm wave, and all the creatures spawn one heart worth of health, but it's a ton of them.

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:17.000
So, all of a sudden we saw, like, 30 creepers just, like, poof, just spawned.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:21.000
It was like, holy shit, there's a huge wave of creepers chasing after me.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:24.000
So, it was kind of fun. But, yeah.

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:28.000
All right. Black Wolf says, we also need a Forza Horizon Knight.

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.000
I'll be down for that. That's on my queue for Game Rental games, so I need to send Silent Hill back,

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.000
because I'm probably not going to play much more of it.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.000
I need to check out that game, because I need to use a game for my, uh, I have my steering wheel.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
That would be fun to mess around with.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
You know what game I have sitting here, waiting to play?

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.000
I haven't, I didn't get around to it for this week, but for next week, on the PS3.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:50.000
XCOM, I have from the Rental guys waiting to play, so, excited to check that out.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:55.000
I want the best PC game this year from, uh, I don't, I mean, I'm kind of surprised.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:01.000
I was, um, spending, uh, Thanksgiving with, um, Spike from Game Buoy, if any of you listen to that show.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:04.000
Which, if you don't, you should. They're a fun duo there.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:08.000
But, uh, Spike was showing me XCOM on PC, and I played, like, a round of it,

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:14.000
and, uh, it was fun. So, I, I put the game in my Rental queue.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
There you go. And now I have it.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Alright, um, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Thank you for supporting independent, you guys are already packing up,

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
and have one foot out the door, and I haven't even rolled credits yet.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
I'm going to drive home. You're home already.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:31.000
No, no. I have to get out.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
My, um, my, uh, mouse died.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Oh, that sucks. Alright.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000

Tell a friend or two about Orange Launch Radio,

and, uh, help spread the word of independent podcasting.

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
You know, if you've listened to this episode and you've thought,

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.000
eh, it sucks, at least support other independent podcasters.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:54.000
There's so many people out there that work hard to, uh, put this out there.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:57.000
If you think it sucks, the more stars you give us,

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
it means the worse you think the show is.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Uh, yes, give us nice reviews on iTunes, please.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Uh, and, uh, you know, wherever you found this podcast.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Help us spread the word and, uh, yeah, that's all we ask.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Um, enjoy the world while it's still here, guys.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
We'll see you next week to do it all again.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:14.000
