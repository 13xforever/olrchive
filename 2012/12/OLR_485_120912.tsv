14090	25071	Tonight, December 9th, 2012, the Wii U is set to get a Google app, Nintendo blocks mature content during the day in one region, and could Idolmaster finally see a localized release?
31246	36949	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37029	45674	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 485 of our show for this December 9th, 2012.
46495	53599	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and gaming lols with my co-hosts.
54039	54559	DarkSakura.com
83931	85834	Right, and I gave everybody Hanukkah presents.
85894	87356	And I say Mazel Tov!
88097	88798	It was delicious.
89198	93564	I knew that Rob loves coffee, so I gave him and Alan a bunch of coffee.
93664	94966	Alan loves coffee too, that's important.
95106	97369	Well, I was like, what would they both like?
97469	99993	So I got them crap tons of Keurig stuff.
100393	105317	And I got our other person in the room gift cards.
105558	106298	Who I should introduce.
106318	107519	Including a Burger King gift card.
107640	109341	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
109461	110402	Yes, and thank you for that.
110782	111303	You're welcome.
111323	112904	Because I'm due by proxy, so.
113345	115507	Yeah, and I give everyone Hanukkah cards.
115607	116107	That's true.
117388	122633	You, you, okay, DarkSakura converted to Judaism, you know, Loki married a Jew.
122753	124575	Well, I don't, what's my connection?
124635	125696	I have friends that are Jewish.
126436	128618	The last girl I ever dated was Jewish.
129739	130680	There you go.
130720	131441	I lived with John.
131581	133603	He's not really Jewish.
133663	134343	I know he's not.
134383	136405	No, that's why I call him kinda Jew-y.
138047	138307	You know.
139508	141069	I really do mean it.
141109	143171	I like all sorts of people that I've met in my life.
143191	144312	And you like their food.
145032	149596	I don't think I've ever met a Jewish person I didn't really truly like, honestly.
150797	154560	Now everybody's going to be like, oh, that's a challenge.
154801	156622	Let me introduce you to the worst person I know.
156682	157183	You know what?
157683	159985	We're now about two weeks away from the alpacalypse.
161003	169866	Oh yes, the whole Mayan calendar No, the alpacalypse, when the woolly, long-necked creatures of the world will come and trample us all Is that a Weird Al song?
170166	186271	No Oh, it should be I thought that was his album, was Alpacalypse Well yeah, but no, it was Alpacalypse But no, there's a thing where they're showing pictures of alpacas and they're saying so many days to the alpacalypse I've been laughing, so I want to have an alpaca party
187631	192274	You know, all I have to say is that how many times have they predicted the end of the world and it didn't happen?
192394	194576	So this is just one more to put in there.
194776	195156	I know.
196137	201541	When NASA has to come out and say, stop being depressed, the world is not going to end.
201761	203142	Your move next, world.
204261	209309	Anyhow, how are you, Tech Master Loki, in non-Armageddon news?
209649	209849	Good.
209869	215998	I've been constantly entering stuff on SteamGifts.com and obviously not winning anything.
216179	216760	Wait, what is this?
217160	219504	SteamGifts.com is basically a site you sign up for.
220304	222646	What happens is people give away Steam codes on there.
222887	223827	So you enter raffles.
224188	228932	And so every time that someone puts a code up there, you get 5% of the points that that code's worth.
228972	234317	So each dollar, say it's a $5 code, it's five points.
234337	235758	You would get one point in your account.
236198	245381	So, like, I went in there earlier and I had 180-some, and so I kept, you know, enter to win, enter to win all these things, and then you come back a few days later, oh, I got more points!
245661	263946	And so you just keep entering stuff in there, and you can, you know, put your own stuff up there if you want, and then they'll give you contributing dollars in which you can go to certain ones they have locked out, okay, you have to have contributed $5 worth of Steam Codes to enter this drawing, and it's a little easier to win because it's going to be more exclusive.
264366	265086	So you just do that.
265206	268008	But since it's free, I figured why not?
268228	270008	And you might win something.
270429	271949	Or, in this case, not.
272089	274150	You might win spam email.
274590	275291	Fill in your box.
276431	290177	We always have the ever-present fourth guest on our show at the chatroom, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live, as we have for the past coming up on 11 years, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
290217	292478	That's vognetwork.com.
293298	299060	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show each and every single Sunday night.
299560	304601	And Actdeft in our chatroom tonight says SteamGifts.com where nobody ever wins anything.
305001	305841	Well, somebody does.
305901	307302	It's just it's very rare.
307482	309362	It's better chances in the lottery.
309502	313404	Actdeft does follow that up with I only won one game in like a thousand entries.
313484	315424	Well, that was one game.
315684	316944	Still better odds in the lottery.
317104	318885	It's better than Loki's done out of that apparently.
319913	323577	Rob, I want to promote something.
323697	323917	What?
323957	324157	Sure.
324377	325438	I told you about it earlier.
325839	326379	My new Tumblr.
328221	328501	Sure.
328521	329162	Why not the Tumbles?
329182	332004	Just because I want people to give me suggestions.
332425	342114	My Tumblr is masseffecting.tumblr.com and I'm doing this series called Lol Effect where I'm doing just all captions on Mass Effect screencaps and I want people to participate.
342834	345557	If you think of a good one, make it and send it to me and I will post it.
345737	349839	Do you think maybe everybody's burned out on that by now because you talk about it every week?
349859	357222	Because that's what I'm getting on Twitter right now is I need to shut up about the series because I'm ruining it by talking about it so much.
357282	357482	No.
357762	358142	Why not?
358202	358402	No.
358963	359303	Dearest.
362261	380829	Alright, again, live.vognetwork.com Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth What I wanted to talk about tonight was the VGAs, which of course happened on Friday night And I don't think any of us watched, well that's not true, Jamie, you saw bits and pieces of it it sounds like
381189	382309	Yeah, I was... Okay.
382790	384890	I saw this gift set go... I wasn't going to watch it all.
384910	393113	And then I saw this gift set go up on my Tumblr feed that was all like BroShep and FemShep playing multiplayer with Garrus.
393973	395094	And I was like, okay, that's funny.
395274	398275	And so I found that the whole VGAs were streamed.
398375	400816	So I went looking through the stream to try to find it.
400836	402456	And I ended up watching bits and pieces of it.
402496	404437	Like the Halo 4 thing was pretty funny.
405057	408578	And then I found the Mass Effect thing and I stopped caring about everything else.
408698	409979	I did watch the Claptrap one.
410279	410979	It was pretty funny.
411880	416222	It was the little blips for best character of the year.
416803	419264	The Claptrap one was funny, I must admit, but no.
421165	422246	Shepard was robbed, both of them.
423166	431191	I'm not going to try to talk about or evaluate a show I didn't watch, but just listening to Bobby, because he is before us every Sunday night at VOG Network.
431591	432252	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
451634	453915	I'm not saying anything bad about the game.
454015	456117	I haven't played it, so I know no good or bad.
456177	465422	But I know a lot of people really love it, and it has nothing to do with the OMG Zombies part of it, but just I guess the storytelling in the game is so good.
465962	476507	And you had another game that was kind of similar in some ways, Journey, which is one of those kind of very difficult to explain to somebody why it's so good, but it's that whole emotional connection.
476587	477008	So it's like...
477928	481610	and Journey probably won, what, the second most awards besides Walking Dead.
481970	485072	So emotion really seemed to connect with the audience this year.
485452	488354	The big bro games, like, what would be the bro games?
488414	493156	Halo 4, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, to some extent even Mass Effect, Jamie.
493616	496278	None of those games really got the same type of recognition this year.
496838	497978	Best RPG, hello!
521425	527770	Does the choice of the awards this year and the way it's all presented mean that they're taking this more seriously?
528811	529272	Any thoughts?
530793	530973	No?
531353	532714	I'm yelling at Dan in chat room.
533255	534016	Dan is in chat.
534176	534576	Oh dear.
534596	537839	I just think that they need to have Samuel L. Jackson hosted each year because he's pretty funny.
538039	538920	Well, they've been doing that.
539360	541622	Well, he's only hosted four times out of ten years, so...
544082	545683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
564867	565788	I know, it looked familiar.
565848	566768	Oh, somebody from Walking Dead.
567048	567329	Yeah.
567449	574273	Which, again, I can't evaluate a game I have not played, so I have nothing good nor bad, but I hear a lot of good things.
574653	576194	And I will play it before the end of the year.
576214	577996	Mark Muir wasn't nominated, was he?
578016	578776	He wasn't even nominated, no.
578816	580357	Yeah, because he wasn't all that great.
580797	581018	But...
583520	583720	He's fine.
583740	584201	He's fine.
599014	602796	and her Carol Danvers makes me a little, you know, warm.
603256	603656	There you go.
604036	604416	Thank you.
604776	606597	The chatter's filling in the gap there.
606697	609879	It was Clementine from The Walking Dead, Melissa Hutchinson.
610539	611499	Yeah, she's not bad.
611719	620383	I don't even, again, I haven't played the game, but I recognize that name as one that people talk a lot about on Twitter, so I can clearly see that, okay, you know.
621823	623343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
649171	656133	And just so you know, the best human male voice was Damian Clark from Borderlands 2 or Handsome Jack.
656553	657233	And that's awesome.
657253	659313	Yeah, that's the little bits and pieces I've heard.
659333	660114	Yeah.
660654	663614	Yeah.
663674	666895	Doesn't the male award seem to go to villains more often than heroes?
669256	675137	Didn't, oh my God, Mark Hamill, thank you, win the award for the Joker last year?
675157	675297	Yeah.
675917	677758	Mark Campbell's awesome.
677798	680400	That's also the last time he's voicing the Joker.
681361	682382	Unless you give him more money.
682462	682842	I doubt it.
685084	692008	You think about people having to do a voice like that that's so different from their regular voice, it's going to actually take a physical toll on someone.
692168	700534	They're going to have to do another Arkham game at some point, though, so it'll be interesting to see how they frame it.
701715	704317	Anything else on the VGAs anyone wishes to comment on?
706249	707150	You need to watch that clip.
707210	707870	It was hilarious.
708010	709011	I'll take a look at some point.
709051	709771	Or Lance, too.
710032	714915	And if anybody wants to see it, it's on my Tumblr, MassAffecting.Tumblr.com Plug, plug, cheap plug.
714935	718197	Well, no, the reason is because Viacom blocked it on YouTube.
719838	721679	Gunstar in our chat room, who could that be?
721699	723020	That's Dan.
723140	729624	No doubt commenting on the awards I was just talking about says, Evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
731565	732086	Well put.
733337	737461	Although, my hubby is awesome because he said Garrus does sound like a boss, though.
739162	745928	His voice actor is kind of a goofy-looking guy, and if you ever watched the episode of Buffy he was in, his awesome voice does not suit his face.
746328	753675	It is kind of nice when your significant other will make a concession towards your fandom, isn't it?
754035	756597	Has Nellie ever made any concessions towards your fandoms, Loki?
756657	758619	No, we had a discussion today about, like...
760060	763122	I'm like, so what exactly, you know, what do you think?
763162	764343	I'm like, oh, garbage.
764543	767946	It's like, my point exactly.
768907	772729	And then in the case of Alan and I, we really do like a lot of the same stuff.
772790	778834	I mean, he's way more into Half-Life than I am, but I don't, like, dislike it at all.
778974	782457	When I played it, it was, you know, the little bits I have played, I've enjoyed.
782897	786280	I just haven't sat down and played the whole thing, so we don't really have...
787040	788081	That same conflict.
788101	789181	I'm sure there's something.
789241	790442	There's something I'm not thinking of.
792202	792563	You know what?
792583	797685	My Rocky Horror thing and my cult movie thing, he's been a good sport about coming out to see those and support that.
798345	801287	It's always nice when you're seeing if another will buy into fandoms and so forth.
802507	808234	Alright, I guess let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.
809175	815522	Ragenator in chat says, what are the odds of Mass Effect and Garrus winning every award if DarkSakura hosted an award show?
815682	816563	Shut up, don't judge me.
816643	817905	This is why we don't host one.
818145	818766	Don't judge me.
819887	821048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
842597	844140	and Fairy Solitaire.
845161	846263	God, that game is awful.
846423	847205	I love it.
847485	850430	For the past three weeks in a row, you've talked about your Fairy Solitaire.
850750	852974	You keep saying it's awful, but it's clearly not.
853590	854911	It's stupidly addicting.
854991	858374	It's like playing on... Remember back in the day when Neopets was big?
860856	861957	Now that was awful.
862498	864980	Yeah, but you remember the stupid card games on Neopets?
865100	865360	Yeah.
865560	867042	And they were kind of addicting?
867402	868303	Is Neopets still around?
868323	869244	They have to be still around.
869444	869904	I'll check.
869964	871185	I wonder if I still have my damn account.
871205	874008	Didn't they sell Neopets shit at Claire's for some time?
874048	874688	Yes, they did.
874968	875389	Oh my god.
875409	877851	Did you ever walk into a Claire's just to buy Neopets stuff?
877911	878512	Be honest.
878832	880073	Someone that we both know has.
880093	880994	What?
883396	884417	who hosts another show.
884777	885617	Oh, okay, okay.
885798	886398	Interesting.
886558	887759	I'm a witness to this.
887779	888259	You know what?
889040	889760	I can't judge.
890020	890481	I can't judge.
890501	890981	I can judge.
891321	894203	People have bought World of Warcraft cards.
894924	895404	I can't judge.
895424	897225	Someone bought a Mass Effect 2 deck of cards.
898186	899607	And, wow.
899887	900107	You?
900147	900367	Yes.
901168	903169	And, wow, lo and behold, the Joker card was Joker.
903249	904630	Everybody has their thing.
907134	912099	No, I have not turned into a My Little Pony fan because there is nothing that is awesome as the old one.
912659	914001	The old one kicked ass.
914381	915362	The new one is stupid.
917344	918705	I'm judging you all.
918805	921948	Anything else for your week besides Mass Effect and Very Solitaire?
922549	930957	I watched Dan play Sega Racing Classic and he put it in karaoke mode and started singing Let's Fry Sky High.
933294	934155	Dan's Cousin's Daughter
953534	971464	I don't know, I wasn't there I was hanging with Becky that night I assumed you were, my bad I was out on a booze buying spree Lots of Bailey's and Hypnotic and Kahlua and Sake And then Becky dyed my hair and then we made fun of people
971784	972965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
993510	994210	Don't listen to her.
994331	994791	It's fine.
997052	997332	All right.
998273	998673	Loki.
999033	999334	Girl.
1000394	1001475	Tell us about a different game.
1002676	1004777	I played Far Cry 3 this week.
1004917	1006638	Actually, a little bit more in the campaign.
1007478	1009039	And it's fantastic.
1009240	1010780	I was hunting dingoes last night.
1011081	1013202	There'll be no baby eating in my launch.
1014503	1015763	And let's see.
1015803	1016524	What else did I do?
1016544	1016584	Um...
1020276	1021297	Thank you for watching!
1034858	1035479	Thanks for watching!
1058462	1058923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1079386	1084452	The number of players plus one times 40 for Psycho.
1084492	1087995	So this thing had like 16,000 hearts of health.
1088436	1091259	So we were literally beating it with a stick for...
1093041	1095242	I'd say 20 minutes and it still wasn't dead.
1095642	1099083	It was just like, okay, I think this is a little too powerful.
1099704	1100784	I had to tweak all that stuff.
1100944	1102485	We have a bunch of cool classes in there.
1103245	1105926	My friend wanted me to make a pimp class, so I made a pimp class.
1105946	1108667	You have a pimp stick that you can beat things with.
1109727	1113789	You have your variety of hoes that you can use that have different abilities.
1114629	1116291	You know, because the game has hoes in it.
1116992	1119714	And what else?
1119774	1122937	There's Wolfmaster that you have wolves that attack things.
1123157	1126100	I have a miner class.
1126781	1132606	And there's a class that's like a golem class that you can build iron golems with.
1132686	1133047	Although...
1133787	1138549	No wait, I had that class, but then the Iron Golems did no damage to anything, so I had to remove that.
1139649	1143411	Ninjas, you know, lots of fun stuff, but it gets hard.
1143691	1148753	I mean, it's just, it's insanely hard, but it's kind of fun.
1148913	1153635	So I'm still balancing that stuff, probably working on that a little bit this week, but some good times so far.
1154635	1159616	And hit stun in chat at live.vognetwork.com wants to know, are we getting world edit back?
1160677	1163197	Yeah, sorry, I've been messing with the permission stuff.
1163257	1167698	Yeah, you will have world edit back soon, as soon as I fix that.
1169559	1174380	I took everything out to figure out why the mob arena wasn't working, and...
1175140	1185711	in the process I kind of removed some of the permissions I may put it back to the permissions bucket the way I had it before because B permissions is kind of weird so I'll fix that again
1188061	1214544	and then Call of Duty just Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2 a little bit of each mostly Modern Warfare 3 because we were supposed to be getting copies to do LAN stuff with but those never came from Activision and at this point I don't think they are coming so I'm not buying copies for everybody so fuck that so we'll just I'll play with my friend and I think that's all I've played this week
1215705	1240821	um wait no there's there's one other thing what the hell did I play this week there's one other game I played yeah it's probably not important uh my gaming week as I've talked about before on the show I did pre-order the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation and uh it came whatever you'd buy it too if you actually no since with the reasons that I'll let you finish
1241300	1242221	Well, here's the thing.
1243061	1249045	I got the game, and it's fine, but it was a little... I'm doing my playthrough again.
1249186	1251407	I haven't done a complete playthrough of the Mass Effect series.
1251547	1254970	I know I've talked about the game a lot, and it's because I really enjoy the multiplayer.
1254990	1256170	It's kind of what's been keeping me afloat.
1256671	1259473	This is the first time I've really sat down to replay the entire series.
1259693	1260774	So I'm doing it this time.
1260834	1266518	It's Renegade's first time I did it at Paragon, and already I'm just seeing such differences in the story.
1267078	1267238	But...
1268719	1269700	I'm playing through the first game.
1269741	1270842	I'm playing it on PlayStation.
1271102	1276007	And if you guys didn't know, this is the first time the original Mass Effect has been on the PlayStation 3.
1276107	1279231	This is the first time.
1279511	1279771	And what?
1279791	1280912	The game's five years old.
1281233	1284576	Because Microsoft had an exclusive on it for however many years.
1284596	1285858	So they're just now bringing it out.
1286478	1288540	So with all this time to...
1289281	1294263	Release it and get it right, you'd think it would be bug-free, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
1294363	1297845	I've been running into quite a few bugs that are not fun.
1298585	1310371	Well, they're not game-breaking, so I can't complain too much, but characters facing the wrong way in dialogue scenes, just weird.
1310431	1314092	Complete parts skipping, but when I load my game, it plays fine.
1314112	1315213	So they're facing the wrong direction?
1315233	1315673	Yeah.
1316013	1317594	I have to ask you a question!
1317654	1317834	Yeah.
1318594	1333079	I only had one thing ever like that happen on the PC version for Mass Effect 3 and that's when you're talking to Liara and Glyph is in the room and if Shepard looks at Glyph then she doesn't look back at Liara at all but that's only for that one conversation
1333482	1334343	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1348642	1351403	So, which by the way, I didn't get to that demo yet.
1352524	1354044	Sorry, don't ask me because I haven't played it yet.
1355725	1357766	But yeah, I played a little bit of that.
1357826	1362028	And besides the bugs, you know, the game itself is still great.
1362128	1369351	But I would still say the best version is either going to be 360 or PC, depending on if you're a console or PC.
1369471	1369791	Actually...
1370071	1372432	For the first game, the PC is the superior version.
1372452	1372972	It really is.
1373252	1379074	Because they made, like, the hacking thing is much better and, you know, just the Mako stuff is not as frustrating.
1379114	1383615	And in the first game, all the Medigel, not the Medigel, the Omnigel all the time.
1383635	1384095	Yeah, yeah.
1384155	1385016	Or whatever that stuff was.
1385296	1385416	So.
1386777	1388118	Let's see, other games I've been playing.
1388298	1392221	I got from my rental service Silent Hill Book of Memories on the PSP.
1392822	1394383	So I was checking that out a little bit.
1394523	1400068	I haven't really gotten much further than the original demo, so I can't really say anything in addition to the demo I've already played.
1400748	1400908	So...
1403973	1407234	I don't hate it, but it isn't really Silent Hill either.
1407714	1410376	Somebody slapped Silent Hill on a dungeon crawler game.
1410636	1411356	That's what it is.
1411876	1413517	I was going to say, yeah.
1413537	1414077	See, that was the thing.
1414117	1415878	I was like, oh, maybe I'll try this and stuff.
1415898	1419040	And then I looked at the back of the box and it had the screenshots.
1419060	1421441	I'm like, what is a top-down third-person game?
1421621	1421941	Nope.
1424165	1425226	I like Alan's comment.
1425266	1428207	Mass Effect 3 still has the exorcism neck bug, which is hilarious.
1428267	1429108	Trainer gets it a lot.
1429448	1431449	Yeah, it's like they're looking completely over their shoulder.
1431509	1432570	I get it the most with Javik.
1433835	1440039	Let me put it this way, when I played the series on 360, I don't remember ever seeing a bug until the Omega DLC.
1440839	1446402	The Omega DLC was the first time I saw bugs in the 360 version, so just put it out there.
1446882	1453726	Oh, by the way, just in case you're curious, the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 1 is based off the 360 version, not the PC version.
1454106	1457208	The hacking game is the whole button-pushing thing, not the...
1459129	1487874	um uh arrow through the circular lock thing that the PC has so interesting but anyway we've talked enough about that game here on this program so I'm just putting it out there that I do have the trilogy on PlayStation and it's just called being a fan and buying all the things you know what what the problem is okay you know I started off playing it on 360 and it hurt my hand
1489508	1496265	I'm not gonna go get another version of a game I've already got on PC when I love my PC version and I can make my Shepard blue.
1497107	1497468	Just sayin'.
1498416	1504839	I'm just... I was curious about, you know, some of the differences and especially multiplayer on three I wanted to have on the PlayStation.
1504859	1505959	Research for the show, Rob.
1505999	1507200	Yes, research for the show.
1507260	1509481	And it's not like I'm going to get a free copy, so might as well.
1510201	1510822	Might as well.
1511802	1512062	All right.
1512702	1513803	That's it for our gaming week.
1513823	1516324	So we'll get into gaming news after I mention housekeeping.
1516704	1519185	Twitter.com slash OLR and, of course, our Facebook.
1519585	1523527	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1524027	1527209	And DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, don't judge me as she's grabbing another locket.
1527629	1529271	I'll have to make another pack during break.
1529391	1530111	I grabbed one earlier.
1530132	1531933	They're so good, but they're not good for you.
1531973	1532914	Why do we keep eating them?
1533214	1534155	Potatoes are potassium.
1534175	1537659	Then Alan's going to get home and be like, you spoiled dinner.
1537939	1541062	I'm going to make him a whole big thing of them, okay?
1541462	1541782	All right.
1542863	1544605	Let's get into some gaming news.
1545045	1545346	Loki.
1545846	1550030	All right, so there is another game that's receiving a nomination for Grammy.
1550671	1552492	That wonderful game would be Journey.
1552833	1560119	And the soundtrack of the game is, I guess, nominated for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.
1560459	1560900	And I guess...
1566144	1574709	Journey, The Adventures of Tintin, The Artist, Dark Knight Rises, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.
1574849	1576190	That would be pretty cool if it won.
1577110	1578811	The soundtrack in the game was pretty awesome.
1581053	1586896	And you may remember, of course, Civ IV won that award, I guess, was that last year?
1587833	1591638	Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists
1603152	1603873	Siv-4 came out in what, 08?
1603973	1604113	But
1622330	1622970	Thank you for watching!
1643459	1666765	so um and I'm not not belittling that achievement by any means that's an amazing thing the amazing piece of work by Christopher Tinn and so happy that he got acknowledged for that um but this is interesting because now this is you know music that was made for the game released on the game soundtrack an entire body of work dedicated to the game getting nominated for the Grammy and certainly that's
1668261	1674802	It's like we dipped our toe in with Baba Yetu, and now we're starting to put the whole foot in by nominating a game soundtrack.
1674883	1678683	And in reality, this is almost as good as it gets.
1679483	1692366	Video game soundtrack songs are not going to really get nominated for Song of the Year unless you have something on the caliber of the Titanic song was the last soundtrack song I can think of that got nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy.
1692866	1695467	So we're long, long away from that.
1696107	1702630	but being up there with all those films that's an awesome achievement so now the question is he going to win?
1704391	1725162	I don't know I know it's hard to say we're not really in the music industry so certainly it's got to be getting him a little more exposure though than the competition but at the same time the artist won the Grammy didn't it or the artist excuse me the artist won the Oscar didn't it so it's you know
1728611	1733698	I don't know if that really ties in just because it won the Oscar doesn't mean I'm going to win for music.
1733718	1734259	That's very true.
1734459	1735360	You never know what will happen.
1735400	1737703	It's a different body of voters and you never know.
1737723	1743711	There might be some people like us that kind of look at it and go, yeah, video games should be getting more recognition.
1744179	1746581	Or there'll be people that react quite the opposite.
1746741	1748902	It just really depends on who's voting on those.
1751464	1755447	Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, It won't win.
1755827	1756848	It's flat out, it won't win.
1757168	1758169	But this is what we wanted.
1759570	1761771	I don't know if not winning is what we wanted.
1761811	1764353	But yes, I don't think that's what he's trying to say.
1764393	1768716	I think he's trying to say the acknowledgement next to the film scores is what we wanted.
1768776	1770958	And yes, I think to some extent that is what we want.
1772759	1776442	Could they possibly have a separate category for game soundtracks someday?
1776542	1780085	Could they be getting confused with Journey the Game and Journey the Band?
1781106	1782067	Dude, I love Journey.
1782087	1784469	They should totally get nominated for Best Soundtrack Score.
1785890	1786911	Probably not.
1786971	1789593	I don't think Journey's been nominated for a Grammy since 82.
1790514	1794517	That's why they need to score the next Tron movie.
1796218	1796558	Alright.
1797079	1798680	Let's move on with some more news.
1799081	1800161	Don't stop light speeding.
1801533	1807076	This one's about a comment from Gabe Newell on living room PCs, which I want to preface this story.
1807196	1814060	You were showing me before the show, Loki, this big screen mode in Steam, which I got to be honest, I haven't played a lot with, but you were showing it to me.
1814140	1825906	And in a nutshell, it does turn your Steam environment into a Xbox style UI that takes up your full monitor space.
1826006	1826226	Yeah.
1826506	1827967	Doesn't look like Windows anymore.
1827987	1828928	It looks nice, I think.
1828988	1829208	Yeah.
1830228	1843433	I like the ability that it basically, since it is catered towards using a joystick, which is fine, that you can sort your games based on joystick support, whether the games have it or not, which is kind of cool.
1843753	1847675	The thing I wish they would add, and maybe this is something that they can add later on, is like...
1848155	1864520	Those games that do not support joysticks, maybe have it where you can have some sort of in-Steam client app or something like that where you can set up almost like an expatter type thing where you can assign keys to the joystick buttons, and then that way you can have a profile for each thing.
1864540	1873663	Because a lot of these games, and actually it's funny because Arma 2 is one that supports the joystick, and I thought that was one that didn't support the Xbox gamepad.
1873683	1876164	I was like, huh, that already does, so sweet.
1876184	1876624	Yeah.
1877184	1882427	And it's not like a wireless keyboard to use as a controller for a game console is unheard of.
1882627	1884548	I mean, Final Fantasy XI?
1884588	1898116	Yeah, but see, the thing is, as I was looking at it, I'm like, you know, that would not be that... It wouldn't be that weird to actually... You know, this whole... Everyone's kind of talking about doom and gloom with the next console cycle and stuff.
1898176	1905040	Not that it's ever going to happen, but if it went the way where, oh, we're going to lock all this stuff down, you're not going to be able to sell used games and stuff like that.
1905820	1907542	Would playing on PC be that bad?
1907642	1909224	No, I don't think it would be that bad, actually.
1909264	1912688	If it's all going through Steam, it seems very convenient for me.
1913129	1916953	And honestly, the vast majority of the games I have on Steam I have not played yet.
1917774	1921459	And it's just that keeps adding to the list.
1921599	1922600	I keep getting things for it.
1922620	1925503	But I have quite a collection that it would be kind of cool to have.
1926124	1949261	A gaming PC hooked up to my TV to play stuff like that Well, that is where Gabe Newell thinks things are going Meaning that those types of living room PCs are going to be big competition for the next-gen gaming cycle This is in an interview with Kotaku at the VGAs Because, you know, Gary Newell was there Was that what she called him?
1949301	1949882	Gary Newell?
1950262	1950862	Something like that.
1951383	1951923	Kind of messed up.
1951943	1954045	There's a clip somewhere.
1954125	1956706	One of the interviewees called him the wrong name.
1957727	1959648	You're Gabe from Penny Arcade, right?
1960529	1961370	Gabe Duell.
1962050	1963011	She apologized for it.
1963031	1963871	Cousin of Dudley D. Wright.
1963951	1965172	She apologized for it on Twitter.
1965272	1972817	And I got to say, you know, live TV sucks sometimes, especially, you know, it can be a lot of pressure.
1972937	1975059	So I shouldn't give her too hard of a time, but...
1975639	1978600	Obviously, she's going to get yelled at for that mistake.
1978660	1989864	But anyway, Gabe Newell doing his thing on the red carpet of VGAs, talking to Kotaku, talking about that the big picture interface ended up being stronger than expected.
1990664	1993005	Next, they want Steam Linux out of beta.
1993365	1996106	They want big picture on that operating system.
1996466	1999788	This gives Valve flexibility in developing their own hardware.
2000068	2000568	That's true.
2002168	2002909	Look at OUYA
2016980	2021002	OUYA is a bare-ass bones type of living room PC.
2021383	2024765	But it's that same setup as you would see with big picture mode.
2024865	2027006	In fact, the interface looks kind of similar.
2027186	2028527	Although I do like big picture a little bit.
2028927	2029947	I mean, from what I've seen.
2030048	2031568	We obviously don't know what the OUYA looks like.
2031949	2033790	Although, we're not that far away.
2034110	2038632	I mean, and that OUYA thing, man, is smaller than this box right here.
2038813	2040313	My four pack of Red Bulls.
2042494	2056840	Gabe Newell said in the interview, quote, I think in general that most customers and most developers are going to find that the PC is a better environment for them because they won't have to split the world into thinking about why are my friends in the living room?
2057080	2059821	Why are my video sources in the living room different from everyone else?
2060321	2063782	So in a sense, we hopefully are going to unify those environments.
2064743	2064963	Hmm.
2067504	2067904	I don't know.
2068124	2068144	I...
2070182	2072022	The unification thing is interesting.
2073083	2077664	I think in a way that's what the consoles kind of want to be that all-in-one device.
2077784	2084546	And you do see that like 360 tries to talk to Windows Media and all that sharing.
2084606	2088287	And even the PlayStation 3, you can kind of stream things off your PC and so forth.
2088727	2092928	It's not exactly intuitive on either one how to do it.
2093348	2098351	I think if a lot of that was built a little more into the interfaces, you'd see a lot more of that.
2098391	2102974	I think they make it too many clicks to get to a lot of that stuff within the consoles.
2103794	2104695	I think it's interesting.
2105415	2110799	I think it definitely lends something to the fact of if they sold a little gaming PC in a box,
2111559	2118243	that looked like a console, hooked up to your TV like a console, ran like a console, why would I need a console?
2118924	2129591	Price point, because I think console prices, it's going to be hard to build a gaming PC for $400 that can run all of these games and look nice.
2130311	2137376	Granted, you can build a $400 gaming PC, but it's not going to run a lot of these games in higher ultra and stuff.
2137716	2145641	And if you're streaming to your TV via HDMI, you're talking a really large resolution, 1080p.
2146182	2152406	So it's going to be a little hard to make them look that nice and run on that big of a resolution.
2153647	2154507	That's the only thing.
2154807	2159130	Granted, a lot of the games get stripped down a bit.
2161172	2161652	That's the thing.
2161692	2166776	With PCs, and like, hell, I spent $1,700 on my PC a few years ago.
2167176	2168597	And it was just like this high-end thing.
2168617	2170179	It ran Crysis, pretty awesome.
2170899	2172680	And then now it's just, it's junk.
2172961	2177144	It's just like, I can't even upgrade it without replacing everything.
2177964	2180086	You know, there's nothing I can salvage from it.
2180346	2181087	Except for the case.
2181347	2182348	Maybe the heatsinks, but...
2183088	2185330	Everything else is just, it's so old.
2185750	2196559	Well, I find the part where he talks about how Linux, the Steam on Linux has to get better so that they can kind of develop a box that supports Linux and so forth.
2197179	2201783	That strikes me as interesting because why do video game consoles usually work the way they do?
2202163	2204465	Because they're dedicated gaming consoles.
2204505	2208568	They don't have all this excess fat for all the other things that a PC does.
2208588	2208968	Right.
2209128	2218811	But the interesting thing about Linux is that, as I understand it, part of the reason people are such fans of Linux is that it's a lean operating system and it doesn't have all the fat that Windows has with it.
2218831	2220372	That's what I'm running on my netbook.
2221692	2223473	Would that be a fair statement about Linux?
2223493	2224493	I'd say so.
2224533	2227534	You've got the control that Windows lacks.
2228095	2233657	So they want to use a better operating system, essentially, to do a dedicated thing.
2234177	2236177	Which makes sense.
2238198	2241419	But could it be as powerful as a dedicated gaming console?
2241599	2241879	I don't know.
2241899	2242719	You make a good point.
2243019	2247220	You expect that a little set-top box is going to do this 1080p, and it probably won't.
2247320	2262883	Granted, a lot of the games on Steam, aside from the big console AAA games, like the indie games, a lot of the indie games don't require a lot of processing power, I think, that you would need on some of these higher-end games.
2263623	2290463	but there are those higher end games that they're also on Steam and a lot of those are the ones that support the controllers so it's going to be hard granted a lot of stuff is going to come down in cost and you can probably build something a little bit cheaper but I think it's going to be difficult for them to come up with something that you can fit in a box small enough because you also have to worry about heat and everything fitting it into a console sized box it's going to be a lot of engineering to get it right
2291023	2296525	Akuma JP in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, what's wrong with being a chubby?
2298225	2300426	There is nothing wrong with being a little fluffy.
2303107	2307488	You'll notice in that whole thing I just talked about, I didn't say I was going to throw out my Windows PC.
2307888	2310409	No, I mean, there's still things that I'll want one of those for.
2310689	2312470	Well, I just want to take a quick look real quick.
2313111	2314511	The Alienware one.
2314612	2316393	Remember, they have their console thing.
2316413	2317994	I was just, you know, an idea.
2320475	2322937	So, it's the X51 mini gaming desktop.
2323237	2328901	And the base price, because it's from Dell, the base price you can pay for that is $699.
2329101	2329801	So, $700 for this console.
2334644	2336946	$699 US dollars.
2336966	2338047	$699 US dollars.
2338627	2339848	And here's what you get for $699.
2341129	2346352	It's a Core i3, which, I mean, that's not going to run some high-end stuff there.
2347233	2351516	You get 6 gigabytes of RAM, you know, a 1 terabyte hard drive.
2352276	2356899	GeForce 640 GT, which is a pretty good graphics card.
2357940	2359801	It's not the top, top, top of the line.
2360361	2364084	But, you know, the Core i3 is really going to hurt it, I think.
2366206	2366586	I don't know.
2366666	2370729	It just seems quite expensive to build something that form factor.
2370869	2373051	Obviously, you don't need to pay Alienware to do it.
2373171	2375933	You can build your own smaller PCs for probably a lot cheaper than that.
2376434	2379336	You know what computer I'm hooking up to my TV as soon as I can?
2380017	2380577	The Commodore 64.
2381678	2398293	and I gotta say, tangent time, to Alan's credit, he told me that he was trying to get me a Commodore 64 for Christmas but it's probably not gonna come through because he tried to do an eBay auction and he didn't, you know, it's outside of his price range or whatever but I was like, damn, that would've been...
2398773	2399414	Awesome!
2399694	2402637	Dude, you just need to go down to the Denios or something like that.
2402857	2406541	I don't think I don't look every time I go to see if one's out there.
2406621	2408283	You have to make sure it works.
2408303	2411706	I actually do go by the thrift stores and keep an eye open, too.
2411726	2416651	Well, my parents supposedly still have our old one, and my dad's kept it all these years, and it might still work.
2416711	2418252	So I said I want them to find it.
2418392	2420574	I don't even know what I'm going to play on it.
2420614	2421115	That's the thing.
2421195	2422977	I just fucking want one, okay?
2425578	2426279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2450956	2451516	Yeah, Weird Al.
2453977	2457899	I did tell him, and this is advice for anybody that might be looking for this retrotastic machine.
2458299	2463221	Don't forget that there's also the Commodore 64C, which is totally fine.
2463641	2465622	It's smaller and has white keys.
2466182	2470043	It's like PS Mini and PS2 or whatever.
2470323	2471184	It's the same type of thing.
2471984	2475205	And then there was the Commodore 128, which had 64 mode.
2476806	2478746	So 128s are totally fine.
2479467	2480167	Just throwing it out there.
2480879	2482520	Everybody get robbed at Commodore 64.
2482860	2486301	Gunstar reminds us the C64 version of Donkey Kong was rad.
2486401	2489683	It was because it had the Pie Factory level.
2490463	2490963	Yes.
2491203	2494444	Which is really supposed to be a metal, a cement factory or something, but it's pies.
2494544	2495325	It was the Pie Factory.
2495405	2496065	I know what you mean.
2496425	2500907	But I will say that looks-wise, the ColecoVision version was really good.
2502028	2502889	for ColecoVision.
2503049	2506092	Hey, the Coleco version of Mousetrap was the best one ever.
2506852	2507533	All right, moving on.
2507593	2508754	DarkSakura, more news.
2509275	2509955	Ugh, Rob.
2510055	2511677	Less ColecoVision, something more current.
2511697	2513458	How about Nintendo being buttheads?
2514759	2518663	So, you know what you can't do, at least according to Nintendo of Europe?
2519324	2522466	You cannot access 18 related content at certain times of the day.
2523027	2525809	In fact, you get a little message that says, you can't do this, meh.
2527351	2537299	It actually, one of the NeoGAF users actually had the issue and contacted Nintendo of Italy's customer support and got this message.
2538020	2545346	Dear customer, we would like to let you know that Nintendo is always aimed to offer gameplay experiences suited to all age groups.
2545766	2551892	Observing carefully the relevant regulations regarding content access that are present in the various European countries.
2552537	2555300	I feel like in that same voice you should be saying, For English, press 1.
2555580	2556441	Para Español, marque numero 2.
2572230	2572570	WaterShowerSauce
2593650	2597213	So, it's like, you've got to be up all night to download anything.
2597273	2597653	Meh.
2598654	2600335	It's like, ugh, whatever, Nintendo.
2600696	2602197	I don't know if they've done this crap here, though.
2602217	2602877	Have they?
2603058	2603178	No.
2603438	2603658	Yeah.
2604219	2607121	So, I guess Nintendo really doesn't like Europe.
2607881	2610343	Unless they want to give them RPGs that we want.
2610424	2613186	I don't think it's because Nintendo doesn't like Europe, Jamie.
2613226	2614507	I think it's some type of...
2615067	2617190	They don't like Italy.
2617310	2621195	My gut would say it's a law thing, but I'm like, I don't think there is a law.
2621636	2622797	Is it a culture thing?
2623058	2625841	It's a cover your ass type of thing, which is all Nintendo ever does.
2627243	2632550	And I think they would have tried to do it here too, except I think Reggie probably put his foot down or shoved up someone's ass and said no.
2634227	2639832	It's weird because I want to come out and say this isn't bad.
2640092	2641012	Hold on, I'm doing a search.
2641173	2643835	But it is bad because I should be able to get what I want.
2644375	2649459	It's not bad if it only comes on when you have parental controls on.
2649919	2651301	Then that's a great idea.
2651361	2653782	This would be a great idea for parental controls.
2654183	2659547	Although, honestly, why would you want your kids using the shop unattended anyway?
2661469	2662830	They can let kids drink wine.
2663942	2666502	But they can't see boobs or blood.
2666542	2668563	But you don't have boobs in video game.
2668603	2671303	And in fact, in Europe's culture, boobs are a little less.
2671343	2673244	Yeah, because America is freaking backwards.
2673364	2674264	Well, exactly.
2674604	2678345	So violence is much more of a thing over there.
2678585	2688746	So maybe that's the difference because we're so desensitized through a lot of the movies like Saw and all that shit, which is taboo over there.
2689066	2690067	Maybe that's the difference.
2690347	2690767	You know what?
2690807	2692087	I think everyone needs to get over it.
2693891	2707932	Well, here's my thing is I wonder if this was kind of a shock for the third parties that are involved in this because if you think about it, that's why am I going to put my game on your marketplace if you're going to limit the sale to only four hours out of a 24-hour day?
2708393	2709495	Brilliant question.
2710384	2712347	SSJ100Matt In all reality, yes.
2712767	2714790	I would love to know what the third parties have to say about it.
2714971	2716433	Who, by the way, sent me a Hanukkah card.
2716874	2718576	SSJ100Matt, my first one of the year.
2718937	2724325	I was going to say, he actually says parental controls are hard for parents, especially stupid ones.
2726878	2727219	DarkSakura,
2751405	2752466	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2769464	2769944	I mean, fuck.
2771205	2781989	This person that knows about these games is probably most likely going to be able to read most of the blogs out there on the internet and go, hey, well, all I have to do is download this at 11 p.m.
2782229	2783490	And they downloaded it at 11 p.m.
2783510	2788792	Kids shouldn't be using this parent's credit card on the store at any hour of the day.
2789032	2790252	And you know whose problem that is?
2790693	2791313	Their parents.
2791873	2793594	And that's whose problem it should always be.
2793814	2794294	Their parents.
2794834	2795574	See, here's the thing.
2795594	2797175	They may not be using their card.
2797215	2803216	They may be buying a prepaid card at a store and putting it in that way.
2803316	2803836	All right.
2804076	2805577	So there's ways around everything.
2805697	2807817	But once again, there's ways around everything.
2807897	2808677	So why limit it?
2808797	2813698	Okay, and I know the comment about parental controls being hard earlier was said in jest or a joke or whatever.
2813758	2820760	But seriously, when you first turn on the Wii U, the first time you're going through the initial setup,
2821260	2822080	There is a question.
2822481	2824862	Do you wish to enable parental controls?
2824982	2825863	Yes or no?
2826583	2832607	So all the parent has to do is be there when their $400 machine is turned on for the first time.
2833327	2838830	And I'm pretty sure if this is like any other Nintendo console or device that comes with... $300, excuse me.
2838970	2846254	Four thick fucking manuals that probably tell you how to set up parental controls if you really wanted to.
2846595	2846735	And...
2847395	2848296	Thank you for watching!
2865103	2866925	Censorship is a fucking bitch ass whore slut
2881667	2882207	You know what it is?
2882227	2882548	Correct.
2882848	2890713	It's just that these violent game trailers and games on the internet are very disturbing to elderly people who thankfully do not stay up past 11.
2892255	2895497	Although... Yes, they all just magically fall asleep right before 11.
2896217	2897699	That's why, though, that it only goes till 3.
2898039	2900260	Because a lot of them do wake up quite early in the morning.
2900360	2904043	So it's that 11 to 3 period that most elderly people are asleep.
2904143	2906044	And that's why they're hiding this.
2906165	2907125	It's not because of the kids.
2907245	2908046	It's the elderly people.
2908266	2912949	VX, Jason, XV, and Chap wants to throw out a theory, and it's a good one, so let me throw it out there.
2913730	2927880	Nintendo is classified as a media service, TV, and now they have to abide by TV laws, which restricts content to those hours in some countries.
2929338	2930198	Not a bad thought.
2931239	2934640	Is this because Nintendo is not treating itself as a game device anymore?
2934700	2936501	Because remember, they make their own fucking rules.
2936561	2937801	It's not an X-Gen system.
2938142	2939442	It's a Nintendo-Gen system.
2940302	2942123	And this is now a television.
2942683	2946425	I don't think so, because look at the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2946725	2953708	I'd say they have as many, if not more, streaming content on there than Nintendo.
2953908	2954188	It's just...
2954768	2958409	Why would you restrict the rules to one console and not the others?
2958569	2961690	I think this is just something Nintendo is doing on their own.
2962571	2967252	I don't think this is anything they're forcing them to do because why aren't they forcing the other guys to do the same thing?
2970633	2971794	It's just Nintendo asshattery.
2971854	2972374	It's what they do.
2974818	2983681	I don't know if it's ass-hattery, but it's very throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which we've seen Nintendo do so many times before, like Friend Codes.
2984341	2990204	Friend Codes was set up to protect, you know, kids, and we all had to suffer for it.
2991004	2995125	It's the same dumb decision that screwed that up that's screwing this up.
2995445	2996706	Thank God it didn't happen here.
2998257	3002620	Although at the same time, do you really need to download Zombie U online?
3002640	3004882	Can't you just go to the store and buy it or get it on Amazon?
3006423	3007764	Seriously, just wait.
3008604	3012487	I mean, Amazon, there's a perfect way you can do that.
3013748	3014669	I don't know.
3015149	3019152	What would be the point of downloading this stuff to your console?
3019192	3019432	I just...
3021169	3022710	I'll throw this out there for what it's worth.
3045123	3071134	you don't have to pay tax on them right now technically you do, you have to report that to the state and your taxes at the end of the year but let's be real, who's doing that so you get them tax free that's not that much of a savings and you get the 10% kickback from Nintendo if you have a Wii Deluxe or Wii U Deluxe which most people probably do that have the Wii U right now I don't think that would be much of a motivator for me
3072708	3073188	Just saying.
3073849	3075189	That is something.
3077271	3078671	And you get it right now.
3078892	3081213	Well, an hour from now when it finishes downloading.
3082454	3083874	Faster than Amazon.
3086356	3088017	Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.
3088217	3091479	So the Wii U has sold 425,000 units in the US after being out there for a week.
3098934	3101195	So compare that to some of the other systems.
3101215	3109220	I believe the Xbox 360 and PS3 and the original... Well, the original Wii, I want to say, sold only 300,000 units during that same time period.
3110961	3111661	The original Wii?
3111902	3113162	I think they say in that same article it's 475.
3113462	3113162	475?
3113502	3113863	Well, yeah.
3113883	3117685	It sold 475 in its first week, but I'm talking about actually now.
3117705	3118645	I think it sold only...
3127110	3129571	I think it was 300,000 units or something like that.
3129651	3130651	It was still pretty high.
3131631	3135652	And of course, the Xbox 360, I think it was three quarters of a million.
3135992	3139693	And I want to say the PS3 was like five or something like that.
3142034	3142934	So I guess it's pretty good.
3143194	3143974	Here's my thing, though.
3144534	3147395	And this is unlike the Wii.
3147415	3150896	See, remember with the Wii, the whole reason was shortages on this stuff.
3151796	3163485	Last I checked, I went to the store, like I went to Walmart one day, and I was like, you know what, I'm just going to go walk down Electronics Island and see what they've got as far, let's see if they have any Wii U's, just see if they've finally gotten stocked.
3163965	3166267	And there was a stack of 10 Wii U's.
3166407	3169269	It wasn't like, oh, people are clamoring to get this stuff.
3169389	3170991	It was just sitting there, no one gave a shit.
3171751	3177055	and same with like you go on like GameStop and you can do a search of their inventories and stuff like that.
3177235	3184400	And I'd say about the majority, well, all of them had some stock on them and some of them had quite a bit of stock on them.
3184780	3193486	So I know that they were doing more to replenish them, but I'm thinking that the demand on this isn't as high as they had hoped.
3193867	3198370	I mean, yeah, 425,000 sounds awesome, but is that going to dip off really fast?
3198430	3198890	Because...
3200431	3201472	They're just sitting there now.
3203134	3203574	I don't know.
3204876	3205256	I don't know.
3205837	3207278	I think it's still too soon to tell.
3207518	3214825	I think we need to see what the entire holiday season looks like, and we need to see what the Fury looks like after the holidays.
3215406	3219550	Like, was it just a holiday thing, or is it still in demand in January and February?
3219870	3221992	But you know what it's going to take to keep that demand going?
3222473	3223354	Games!
3223834	3224695	And we've got...
3226363	3228444	Pikmin in March.
3230264	3230945	Wii U games.
3231105	3233005	Let me refresh my memory.
3233085	3233686	Wii U games.
3233766	3238147	We've got 30 Great Games.
3238387	3239027	What's that game?
3239047	3244969	Family Party, 30 Great Games, Arcade, or Obstacle Arcade.
3245089	3249331	Tell me you've seen the Miiverse stuff for the 30 Great Games stuff.
3250783	3259625	Oh my god, Miiverse is becoming more and more one of the most genius things to happen in gaming ever.
3260146	3262926	And I'm not giving Nintendo all that credit.
3263006	3265247	It's an idiot savant type of genius.
3266047	3268428	It's unintended genius.
3268888	3271529	Miiverse is amazing.
3272389	3276370	Have you seen the stuff on Miiverse for some of these shovelware games that show up?
3276910	3277910	Alright, I gotta get the Wii.
3278110	3278851	You've gotta see this.
3279191	3283592	Loki, you'll laugh your ass off at some of the stuff that people are posting in Miiverse on these games.
3283812	3284252	But anyway.
3285212	3292534	But I was gonna see, like, right now I'm looking just to see what's in this area, you know, as far as, like, availability.
3293154	3293934	And let's see here.
3294534	3299315	The first one, Low Stock, In Stock, In Stock, In Stock, Low Stock, In Stock, In Stock, In Stock.
3299415	3302476	And that's the, you know, first eight stores that they have there.
3303156	3306897	InStock, InStock, InStock, LowStock, InStock, LowStock, LowStock.
3306917	3314100	So it looks like within 20 miles of us, they are stocked at every single GameStop.
3314560	3320462	And I think that's the same thing happening at Walmarts, Targets, probably everywhere.
3320582	3326364	So that begs the question, I mean, I understand this may be a hot holiday item, but...
3327904	3335407	I don't think it's as in demand as they want everyone to believe it is.
3335907	3340249	And don't get me wrong, they have some pretty good games at launch, but they don't really have anything coming out.
3340929	3343370	The first Wii U game I can think of is in March.
3344231	3346112	Rayman Legends is the... Not March.
3346812	3349053	February 26th is Rayman Legends.
3349133	3352954	It's the first big game to come out next.
3353454	3353535	Um...
3355185	3365537	Cool, that's like a whole month and a half, almost two and a half months of nothing for the Wii U. I mean, that's kind of bad.
3366479	3369482	That's quite a drought of games.
3373547	3374608	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3399591	3400292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3419668	3420148	What's on his head?
3444252	3445534	Oh, that was from Nintendo Direct.
3446495	3452042	So basically, it's just your average forum with all sorts of memes in here.
3452282	3458230	But that is Nintendo moderated and Nintendo endorsed on the console.
3458770	3461814	If you press pause and hit Miiverse, that is what you'll see.
3462659	3469102	Yeah, that's cool that they're only removing offensive stuff, but not a lot of memes are offensive.
3469822	3473144	Do you see a lot of the stuff with the jokes about shovels?
3473684	3477106	Yeah, I understand the Nintendo seal of crap.
3478947	3481548	I understand that, but I hardly call this genius.
3481608	3483689	I just call this your standard forum.
3483749	3485049	Are you not entertained?
3485670	3486950	No, I'm not entertained.
3489451	3490212	I mean, I just...
3492225	3493767	I just don't... I don't know.
3493927	3495269	It's just... This just in, everybody.
3495329	3496311	Loki is not amused.
3496551	3497993	I mean, they have Barry Potter.
3502098	3504201	And Batman that says, I have no family.
3504822	3505122	I just...
3507452	3507873	I don't know.
3508233	3511859	I don't think this is that great.
3512760	3514523	Maybe it was better the first couple days.
3514784	3516246	Some of it's wearing off.
3517187	3517868	Moving on.
3517888	3520973	Do you want to look, DarkSakura?
3520993	3521975	It's kind of funny, I guess.
3523336	3531481	Anyhow, Panorama View was originally unveiled at E3, but they announced that it is coming in the spring, obviously.
3531781	3543648	Also coming, Google Maps for Wii U. The Street View functionality with Google Maps will work with the gamepad just like Panorama View, because those Google cars take...
3544228	3548491	Oh my god, I better buy a Wii U so I can get Google Maps What's with the flying penis rocket ship?
3574725	3578126	That's Miiverse.
3578186	3581348	Somebody tried to get away with drawing a penis on Miiverse, so they drew it as a rocket ship.
3581368	3582508	Hey, this isn't uncomfortable.
3584369	3586730	Yeah, I thought you played with the Wii U thing before.
3587831	3589371	Not with your little thing here.
3590372	3591773	I'm not going to say anything about your little thing.
3593473	3593753	All right.
3596495	3597255	Let's move on.
3597635	3598836	DarkSakura, it's actually your turn.
3598856	3601257	You'll have to put the tablet down for a minute.
3602191	3603625	Take your evil away from me, Rob
3605814	3617360	So, uh, next, uh, there, and this, people have been going off about this, and, you know what, I was gonna be super skeptical of it until I actually did look at the logo.
3618720	3627485	Needless to say, I'm talking about the Phantom Pain, which, basically, it's a trailer of a guy that they had at the, um, VGAs.
3628125	3633168	The guy has a hook arm, and he's like, you're just waking up, and then a hundred feet soldier, brr,
3634209	3635131	We're getting killed out here.
3636796	3640205	And if you look at the guy walking around, he's got a gray mullet.
3641858	3646320	And a shaggy beard when you can sort of see his face, but most of his face is covered up in bandages.
3647700	3649881	And he's missing a hand, he's got a hook arm.
3650841	3654303	And it's being put out by this Moby Dick Studios.
3655463	3660845	Which, I mean, I can't really think of anything how Moby Dick itself could be an allusion towards it.
3661185	3665127	Because, I mean, it's just a big revenge story, so maybe there's some revenge subplot?
3665147	3665607	I don't know.
3666648	3669531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3683184	3692128	Now, as I posted much earlier in the chat room, is that if you look at the logo, there are little chunks missing out of the text.
3692928	3712077	And if you use the same typeface and align it to these little markings that are coming out of the text, it perfectly fits the shape of Metal Gear Solid V. And I will relink the photo in the chat room for those who are curious.
3713017	3738831	but I mean and I mean I'm even looking it has to be of course in the same typeface but it is a perfect match it's sort of like they posted it there and then used the pathfinder tool in InDesign or something for anyone who knows what that is but it's I guess I see it now I didn't see it at first until I looked at the logo
3741781	3744923	It makes sense that it's time for another Metal Gear Solid.
3744963	3747845	I know they always say the other one's going to be the last one, but come on.
3748606	3751148	They'll take that until it stops making money.
3751368	3751728	I don't know.
3751908	3753129	I don't know if it's Metal Gear Solid.
3753609	3755150	I think it's New Bionic Commando.
3755691	3756351	And spoiler!
3756391	3756692	What?
3757052	3758673	His wife is his claw.
3762195	3762436	No.
3765057	3765678	Spoiler!
3765778	3768100	Just look at the picture that I linked in the chat room, guys.
3770154	3774636	The Supreme Court is going to decide next year if I get to get married or not, but you can marry your AI.
3798160	3800987	To quote Rob, put her in a CD, I don't care.
3802307	3805308	They had all those tubes and they're like, we need to fill the tubes with something.
3805368	3809169	So they just threw his wife in a wood chipper, shoved her in the tubes for the final commando.
3810729	3812369	You shouldn't put your wife in a wood chipper.
3812429	3813029	That's wrong.
3813410	3815650	She'll say she can't, but put her in there anyway.
3815670	3818011	Well, he didn't put her in a... I don't know.
3818771	3820511	Why would you put your wife in a wood chipper?
3820631	3821091	That's really rude.
3821111	3826373	Maybe he's just really into self-gratification and so, you know, he thought his wife is the claw.
3827193	3827773	That's wrong.
3828753	3829033	Men.
3829734	3831455	Because the claw touches him and weighs it.
3831695	3832496	The claw.
3832976	3833777	His hand can't.
3833997	3835699	It decides who will go and who will stay.
3836659	3839581	Can we please, please get to release dates?
3839802	3840042	I guess.
3840062	3842364	Although I'm not expecting to hear an awful lot, but let's see.
3842904	3843484	Release dates.
3843985	3844385	All right.
3844485	3848548	So this week we've got the game of the year, The Walking Dead.
3849669	3853092	The Hulk basically season one on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3853132	3853212	Yeah.
3855454	3858238	007 Legends on the Wii U Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U
3869804	3894084	Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U like with Vanna White and shit awesome 60 bucks it's the game that they yeah it's like 40 I think it's the game that they put out on the Wii and Xbox 360 earlier I like Wheel of Fortune I'm real good at it well there you go and Jeopardy Jeopardy on the Wii U I'm not as good as Jeopardy that's for smart people um
3897278	3898159	Not anymore, really.
3898219	3899640	Have you ever watched Jeopardy lately?
3899940	3901661	I can only watch Celebrity Jeopardy.
3903823	3904923	Damn you, Trebek!
3905884	3911328	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing transformed on the Vita.
3912429	3914490	Oh, I was like, isn't that on every platform?
3914830	3916591	No, not the Vita.
3916611	3916932	3DS.
3917152	3919193	3DS got delayed a little further.
3921255	3921795	That's it!
3922035	3924997	And I hate to say it, I think that's it for the rest of the year.
3925017	3925057	Um...
3927158	3927518	Port Royale 3
3948605	3951528	I don't recognize this as a series here.
3951809	3959597	It came out on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in August, I think.
3959637	3960918	It's like a Pirates game.
3961038	3962640	Yeah, it's a Pirates simulation game.
3962800	3964222	But not Sid Meier's Pirates.
3964322	3968687	No, it's Calypso, I want to say, puts that out.
3969969	3971010	Russell in Japan.
3971270	3976413	I think over here it's Calypso.
3976453	3978354	They're the guys that put out Tropico.
3980935	3982957	It's a trading sim.
3983897	3984798	Maybe Pirate or Trader.
3985798	3991184	Much busier week on the PlayStation 3, Battlefield 3 also there as well, and Port Royale 3.
3991665	3996690	Ninja Gaiden Sigma also gets a price reduction along with Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus.
3997111	4006361	But as far as new games go, Sango Kushi 12 comes out in regular and premium editions from Koei.
4006501	4007362	This is...
4009460	4013101	Sengoku, Three Kingdoms Military-based, politics-based, or fundamental
4037187	4052220	Or Artistic Dance No, you cannot have Artistic Dance Also, price reduction for Sengoku Basara 3 Utage So lots of price reductions this week, just in time for Christmas On the Vita this week in Japan
4053001	4079593	Jikuyu Powerful Pro Yakyu 2012 Petai Ban That's the Konami Baseball Series on the Vita this week On the PSP this week, yes, the PSP 7th Dragon 2020 gets a price reduction And then we have Arcana Famiglia Festa Regalo comes out this week I have no idea what that is on the PSP But it has free shipping
4081256	4082558	Depending where you order it from, yes.
4083078	4085901	These guys are dressed up like it all in like little suits.
4085981	4089445	They're little chibi suit characters, but this one has an eye patch, so you know he's rough.
4090569	4091490	Chibi Snake Chibi Snake
4111167	4115150	Sango Kushi 12 comes out on the Wii U this week in Japan as well.
4116391	4121075	And lastly, checking the 3DS, Biohazard Mercenaries 3D gets a price reduction.
4122056	4129923	And Inazuma 11 Go 2, Chrono Stone, Nepuyu and Rame come out this week from level 5.
4131522	4132783	And Rob will hyperventilate now.
4133323	4133883	Yes, I will.
4135044	4136685	Oh, Puyo Puyo gets a price reduction.
4136705	4137525	Puyo Puyo.
4138786	4139386	No one cur.
4140427	4140947	I care.
4141948	4143108	Okay, one cur.
4144089	4145910	That does it for Japanese release dates.
4146330	4148792	In Europe, not a damn thing.
4149912	4150232	The end.
4151593	4152674	Seriously, not a damn thing.
4152714	4154995	The game will be out the entire week.
4155895	4158557	A different version for every system that has ever existed all week.
4161294	4161735	I'm serious.
4163217	4163838	Not a damn thing.
4165280	4165921	Just crickets?
4166402	4166903	Just crickets.
4167163	4168205	Nothing until the 17th.
4170428	4171510	Which is not this week.
4173519	4176101	Let's do a couple more stories before the classic game of the week then.
4177162	4184307	Alright, so Motorola has failed to ban the Xbox in both the US and Germany.
4185067	4195315	And apparently, I guess, a judge has ruled that Google's Motorola can't ban the sales of the Xbox 360 over patent dispute.
4196536	4201479	And, of course, no one had any comment on it and the case moves on.
4202800	4206262	So, that's good and kind of what we thought would happen.
4206282	4214587	I don't think they would ban the sale over that, but... Yeah, can you imagine if they just suddenly pulled the Xbox 360 off of shelves?
4214767	4221570	They're just gonna, you know, go through the courts right now and I'm sure at the end they're gonna settle or have to pay some sort of royalties or something.
4221690	4224932	Somebody's going to, so we'll see.
4225072	4231095	Going to a game that once could have been, but it's not gonna be, Guitar Hero 7.
4232196	4234918	Guitar Hero 7, at one point, it was going to happen.
4235198	4238541	It was in development, but Activision canned it in 2011.
4239162	4244326	This is all coming from an anonymous source via Kotaku, so take it with a huge grain of salt.
4245086	4246688	But it certainly sounds plausible.
4247208	4251552	Guitar Hero 7 was going back to the roots, meaning it was only going to use a guitar.
4251992	4254974	So it was going to lose the drums, the mic, and all that other stuff.
4255135	4258037	Rock Band kind of had the lock on that, so it was going to go back to just guitar.
4258417	4260161	But the guitar was gonna go through some changes.
4260722	4264069	A full six strings and an extra button in the neck.
4264912	4267013	However, the guitar apparently was expensive.
4267893	4269394	It was a disaster.
4270274	4270974	Unresponsive.
4271474	4273575	So that was not going to be happening.
4274455	4276776	Vicarious Visions was the team that was developing it.
4277536	4282318	They were going to do this thing where the music video would actually change for each song.
4283018	4289381	So they were trying to separate themselves from a rock band, which I applaud.
4290201	4290941	But I don't know.
4290961	4293162	I guess maybe this music video thing wasn't really working out.
4294682	4321611	But maybe that would have been the theme, was like making music videos like MTV Apparently the songs were not that great either It was all the worst hits from the 1990s In other words, stuff like Closing Time and Sex and Candy Ugh, Closing Time The old, remember that's the old outro for this show I know, but But to tell you something else about that In magazine class last time we did it, not this semester but last year
4322699	4328166	At the end of every class, he would play that song right before we had our meeting.
4329288	4330529	That's what that song makes me think of.
4332331	4334011	And yes, some good conversation in chat.
4334492	4336932	VXJasonXV is like, why the jump to seven?
4337072	4343293	I knew there was Guitar Hero 4 and Orin G points out Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.
4343393	4345214	So there were other games in between.
4345454	4347194	That's not even counting the spinoff games.
4347234	4348474	Like there was Band Hero.
4348534	4352235	There was... Was that the Taylor Swift one was Band Hero?
4352275	4352975	What was the family hero?
4352995	4354455	Who gives a crap about Taylor Swift?
4354475	4355056	I'm just saying.
4355076	4356756	There was like a... There was Band Hero and then...
4359093	4359393	DJ Hero for $20
4388001	4388761	It's awesome.
4389141	4391202	Seriously, the soundtrack is still awesome.
4391922	4393502	That's a game that could have won it for the soundtrack.
4393522	4395203	I need to go back and play that game again.
4395663	4397143	There's some really good mixes in that game.
4399244	4400144	It's awfully sad.
4402485	4407326	Well, remember a time when we didn't have seven versions of a particular game?
4407886	4408426	Yes, we did.
4408686	4409526	Unless it was Mega Man.
4409727	4411267	No, unless it was Street Fighter II.
4411963	4412723	Oh yeah, there is that.
4413003	4413404	There is that.
4413824	4415685	Is this game before or after Street Fighter 2?
4416225	4423488	As we get into the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that is older or about the same age as Street Fighter 2.
4423528	4424428	Contemporary.
4425169	4428950	And say, hey, you should be playing this game this week, damn it.
4429710	4430391	Yeah, damn it.
4431111	4435113	And this is another one that Dan picked out because I couldn't think of anything.
4435813	4436413	Sunset Riders.
4437334	4438074	That's a good pick.
4438094	4439595	Did you ever play it?
4439675	4439915	I did.
4441414	4444396	Sunset Ride, and you know, actually, I have played it.
4445337	4453682	I just was, the only place that had one was in an arcade, which was a tilt arcade in Dothan, Alabama, and then it was gone.
4456591	4459053	Sunset Riders is a side-scrolling game.
4459613	4463355	You basically run around and shoot guys with your guns.
4463616	4468759	You jump from back to back of stampeding cattle and ride horses.
4470200	4474183	I like how the article says it's a fanciful Wild West.
4475706	4478888	Outlaws in the West
4499019	4505885	and in between each day it shows you a wanted poster of whoever it is and your reward and wanted dead or alive.
4506305	4507106	You know, that type of thing.
4508227	4527502	So you play as Steve and Billy and their guns are Peacemakers which are faster and then you have Bob and Cormano which I don't even know if that's a real name but I was laughing because he's wearing a pink poncho and they have a few shotguns so they have wider shots and
4529306	4545545	in the two player mode you actually can choose the character you want to control before you start the game but in four player each person is assigned to a character kind of like how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was just like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which is clearly the engine this game is using just saying
4547822	4553646	This is definitely... They're trying to make Lightning Strike twice after that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.
4553846	4556388	It's clearly the same hardware, which is fine.
4556408	4557649	But this game has hookers.
4558469	4558849	See, look.
4559090	4560991	He goes in the room, and there's a hooker.
4561131	4563012	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had April O'Neil.
4563292	4563973	She wasn't a hooker.
4564994	4565814	She did have cleavage, though.
4565834	4567275	Some of the pictures I've seen, she is.
4568176	4569617	Clearly, you haven't been on Tumblr.
4570377	4572178	Anyway, any... Whatever.
4573739	4574080	Dirty men.
4574100	4575360	Everyone can be a hooker on Tumblr.
4575380	4575921	Dirty men.
4576581	4577502	Especially Hawkeye.
4578222	4581424	Yeah, well, the Hawkeye Initiative is awesome.
4582364	4588067	So anyway, you can jump from different floors, which use the joystick and jump, the usual thing.
4588388	4590989	You can shoot downwards, diagonally, or vertically while crouching.
4591009	4596352	I mean, it's basic run and gun controls for a game like this.
4597132	4602899	You have badge shaped power ups that you get by beating these guys carrying sacks.
4603500	4608045	The silver badge gives you a second gun so you can shoot in two directions at the same time.
4608225	4613170	And the gold badge lets you fire continuously when you hold down the shoot button.
4614011	4615353	And you can use both power ups together.
4617194	4622878	There's eight stages and you basically have to reach the end of each stage and beat the bad guy and get your money.
4623218	4623858	Yeehaw.
4624839	4628721	Although when I saw the first boss, I was asking Dan today, is he not wearing any pants?
4629321	4630882	Because it looked like he wasn't wearing pants.
4631543	4633244	I think it was just the perspective in the game.
4633824	4636205	And Dan said that the only people not wearing pants were the hookers.
4637406	4638527	And the cowgirl.
4638627	4639307	And those chickens.
4639667	4640168	And the chickens.
4641088	4642189	And the stampeding cattle.
4642709	4643590	They're not wearing pants either.
4643610	4645671	Wasn't that a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?
4646291	4649653	Dark Horse, which just makes me think of Bad Horse in, um...
4674971	4681369	Dr. Horrible The Smith Brothers El Greco Wouldn't that mean the Greek?
4684011	4685191	Is it like Greco-Greek?
4685211	4685811	Spanish for Greek?
4686932	4687112	Sure.
4687392	4688433	Okay.
4688513	4689593	Chief Scalpem.
4690254	4693475	Oh, Scalpem, which is... Oh, insensitive.
4693915	4694816	Paco Loco.
4695916	4701999	And Sir Richard Rose, a Britishman who's shooting from the balcony behind two lions.
4703740	4707602	There were... I'm trying to find my favorite part, which is...
4709873	4711174	Oh yeah, the stuff about the SNES version.
4711214	4712335	Okay, I'm going to get back into that.
4712615	4714737	There were two major ports.
4714757	4724384	There was the Mega Drive version, which was a Sega Genesis, where it actually, two of the characters in the Genesis version were given surnames when they didn't have one.
4724424	4726726	It was Billy Cool and Cormano Wild.
4727566	4729028	So they were Cool and Wild, apparently.
4729928	4744793	and only four of the eight bosses were there so the four chapters were divided into two stages and the bosses in this version were Greedwell, Pakoloko, Scalpum and Richard Rose and the bounties were different they were increased depending on who it was
4746393	4750774	and Genesis 1 had what looks like a two-player versus mode where you could fight each other in a gunfight.
4751635	4754736	The SNES version had fewer changes.
4756216	4771441	You could still play only up to two players at a time but it had all eight stages with their bosses and all the power-ups were the same but there were some different I would say censoring done.
4772321	4775042	The whore that I'm just going to call her a whore, I don't care.
4775402	4780364	She's supposed to be, I guess, like a bar girl, but she's totally done like an old west, you know, no-call girl.
4781444	4785606	She kisses the player in stage one and the saloon dancers in stage four.
4786126	4788087	They're dressed more conservatively.
4788267	4794190	The hunter dogs were taken out of the SNES version, but they were in the Genesis version.
4795090	4802413	And the Native American enemies were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpum, who was renamed to Chief Wigwam.
4803723	4805264	Yeah, because that's just as good.
4806205	4810909	And the Dynamite Tossing Female Bandits were taken out as well, but they were still in the Genesis version.
4812651	4814913	So, yeah, Sunset Riders.
4815293	4819236	Which I also think is funny, because you know how when you're reading the articles they have a C also?
4820297	4823840	I love that it lists Wild West CAW Boys of Moo Mesa.
4825322	4826362	That's just wonderful.
4826863	4831487	I like the stage where you're going along the train shooting the bandits.
4832850	4833470	Yeehaw!
4834911	4839774	You know, you say that, and then you mentioned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and now I'm thinking, yeehaw, Ninja Cowboy.
4840314	4843756	Well, in chat, they were talking about Gunsmoke, the NES game.
4843776	4845778	You know, kind of like the other Western shooter game.
4846118	4846338	Yeah.
4846358	4847699	That was a good game.
4847779	4852281	See, Dan kept correcting me and saying Call Girl, and I'm like, it's a whore.
4853682	4855003	She's a whore.
4855223	4855824	A whore.
4855884	4856684	She is a whore.
4856764	4858065	Oh, so my mom says, a whore.
4859989	4861530	She walks the night.
4861650	4862670	She is a tramp.
4866472	4866792	There it is.
4866812	4868173	Your classic game of the week.
4868413	4869433	Sunset Riders.
4869513	4871574	And no, I'm not doing Mass Effect for classic game.
4871614	4872494	It's not old enough yet.
4873855	4874435	It's getting there.
4875876	4876956	I'll classic game you.
4877276	4877617	I don't know.
4877657	4878697	It feels like it's that old.
4879597	4879838	Fine.
4879898	4880898	Next week, Mass Effect.
4880998	4881298	No.
4882059	4883619	Games have to be at least ten years old.
4883659	4883959	Alright.
4884560	4885280	And yes, Fifth Dream.
4885300	4886881	My mom really actually does say it that way.
4887421	4887561	Hoomer.
4887581	4887761	Hoomer.
4888504	4888845	Hooer?
4889948	4891151	Well, my granddaddy said it that way.
4892053	4894419	My granddaddy was from Bridgeport, Connecticut and my mom's a southern girl.
4895060	4896403	So it translated to Hooer.
4897338	4898399	Alright, enough whore talk.
4898719	4899959	More talk about the classic game of the week.
4899979	4900920	We need more whores!
4901100	4901980	Sunset Riot.
4902000	4903961	Whores need love too, only they charge for it.
4905122	4906463	We've got plenty more show to come.
4906723	4910285	We're going to talk some Microsoft, Cloud Gaming, Idolmaster.
4910525	4911105	Yes, Idolmaster.
4911125	4911725	And whores.
4912406	4913106	Maybe some whores.
4913947	4919690	Maybe some whores will call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.
4919710	4920710	That is our name on Skype.
4921010	4922771	We will be taking calls after the break.
4923251	4926313	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, stay tuned.
4932375	4942082	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, December the 9th of 2012 with the 485th episode of our show.
4942322	4944063	We're about to get into rapid fire news.
4944443	4948246	Myself and Loki here in the studio and DarkSakura in the kitchen.
4948326	4950367	She volunteered.
4950387	4950788	She's in there.
4950808	4952669	She's making more latkes.
4953690	4958213	Alan, you are not prepared for the mountain of latkes that are going to be here when you get home.
4958773	4959894	I hope you like potatoes.
4961815	4962456	and Matza.
4962716	4963297	They're good though.
4963657	4964198	Not gonna lie.
4964959	4965259	Alright.
4965920	4969104	Anyhow, while she finishes those up, we will get into some rapid fire news.
4969445	4970907	I gotta talk about this real quick though.
4971467	4973770	Loki, do you play a lot of fighting games, Loki?
4973931	4975272	You don't talk a lot about fighting games.
4975292	4975893	Do you play a lot?
4976213	4976794	No, not really.
4976834	4977255	Not really?
4977615	4978797	Did you ever play Capcom vs. SNK 2?
4980834	4982315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5006012	5006672	and what have you.
5006913	5010075	And you guys during the podcast don't get that, but we play some music.
5010135	5014619	And while the Capcom vs. SNK 2 song was playing, somebody in chat said, where was this?
5015760	5021825	SGO100Matt said, there isn't an HD remix of Capcom vs. SNK 2 coming out anytime soon, huh?
5022285	5023927	And it made me think, no, there's not.
5024007	5028471	And that made me sad that there is no... Oh my god, that's a lot.
5028531	5030332	DarkSakura, you are making me so fat.
5031353	5032274	I am fat because of you.
5036727	5038329	Anyway, no HD version of it.
5038969	5043454	For me to sit on my fat ass and eat latkes and play Capcom vs. SNK 2 HD.
5043814	5045176	That is just not happening.
5046516	5046896	King of Fighters
5067516	5073559	Um, so... I mean, I would imagine that Atlas would work with them.
5074019	5081982	After all, I don't know if you guys know this, Persona 4 Arena, best fighting game, which is very unusual.
5082202	5093126	I mean, you would think that that might go to, like, Street Fighter X Tekken or something like that, or even... I don't know if it's too late, but PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or something like that.
5093647	5096008	But, um, definitely going a little bit more niche with...
5097208	5098169	Who's winning these things?
5098429	5099069	Very interesting.
5099850	5102892	Well, sometimes the Oscars don't always go to the big budget movies.
5102932	5103893	In fact, they often don't.
5104073	5104974	They go to the niche stuff.
5105854	5107355	Maybe the VGA is taking a nod from that.
5107415	5107715	I don't know.
5108476	5109016	It's interesting.
5109797	5110177	Let's see.
5110517	5113539	Chatters are complaining that they are not getting latkes.
5115481	5115941	Come over.
5119079	5121540	DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, make your own damn latkes.
5122201	5124282	DarkSakura's gonna set off the smoke alarm, watch.
5125482	5126423	It's over, no, it's over here.
5128144	5128864	Yeah, good idea.
5130145	5131085	The last thing we need.
5132166	5140010	I can say, that's one thing that hasn't happened in 11 years of Orange Launch Radio is that we've had to evacuate.
5141826	5145349	I've subbed the smoke alarm before when drinking bacon late at night.
5146109	5151393	But then we had the smoke alarm defense system where the giant fan aimed at the smoke alarm.
5151714	5153075	We've had the power go out.
5153575	5155517	We've passed out drunk during the show.
5155837	5157298	We've never had to evacuate.
5159880	5160861	Oh yeah, that's true.
5160941	5162362	We lost the soundboard.
5163703	5164203	Alright, anyway.
5164984	5167286	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
5168286	5169847	Some quick news stories for you guys.
5170688	5171589	Loki, starting us off.
5172229	5175211	So, Minecraft's getting another update, as they tend to do.
5175371	5179234	Of course, we know the big update, the Redstone update, is coming in January.
5179594	5181696	But until then, they're going to get some smaller updates.
5181876	5183697	1.46 is going to be the next one.
5184117	5188740	And some of the things you can expect for 1.46 that are actually available right now on Snapshot 12w49a include...
5192870	5193490	Fireworks!
5193991	5198613	Yes, it's only, I don't know, five months late, but fireworks are getting added in.
5198633	5201074	You can actually craft different colored fireworks.
5201274	5207437	Fireworks that sparkle, fireworks that go higher, lower, and even fireworks that are shaped like creepers.
5208397	5217404	and then also there's supposed to be a book that you can use to enchant items and of course other bug fixes and stuff.
5217864	5223889	But 1.46 is supposed to be released sometime before Christmas, so next week or so.
5225950	5227872	You know who I found out today plays Minecraft?
5228913	5229033	Who?
5229093	5230274	My nine-year-old cousin.
5232759	5233680	I just thought it was interesting.
5234060	5237442	You can join the VOG Network.
5238022	5238843	I don't trust that.
5238863	5246608	We seriously had someone join this week, and they're like, is there seriously no one on here all the time?
5246628	5248309	I'm like, I'm on here.
5248849	5256634	And his mom was telling me, do you know how many viruses we've gotten on our computer because he keeps trying to find a free version of Minecraft?
5257142	5286689	there is no such thing as a free version of Minecraft they're all viruses we had to kind of explain that because it's like yeah you have to log in with your account and all that stuff you can play on cracked servers is the only way he can get around that I said you can do the free version that doesn't have all the I mean he's 9 he's not going to miss all that stuff although he was asking me he's like have you ever built a nether portal I'm like no a 9 year old just kicked my ass at a video game
5288646	5291087	You didn't have to, because we did it all for you.
5291107	5292108	There's like 50 of them.
5292388	5293989	Yeah, I know.
5294429	5298131	All right, so The Last of Us was revealed to be coming out May 7th.
5298151	5300673	This is coming from the trailer that played during the VGAs.
5301373	5303054	So yay, another game.
5304695	5312599	And last but not least, in the realm of I don't give a shit about this, but we're going to report it anyways because originally it had something to do with gaming, but now it's so far away from gaming.
5313519	5317821	G4, or what used to be G4, is now becoming the Esquire Channel.
5318001	5320082	Wow, I could really care less about that.
5320302	5323583	In fact, I do care as little about that as possible.
5324044	5329326	But apparently it is a network that is going to be aimed at the metrosexual male community.
5329386	5329987	Fashion, Cooking, Travel
5351138	5352678	Vomit is what I say.
5353538	5354779	I don't know.
5354899	5358839	I hope this crashes and burns pretty fast.
5358939	5360640	And honestly, I think it will.
5361040	5363040	DarkSakura, do you think metrosexual is hot?
5363360	5364700	Whatever that's supposed to mean anyway.
5365221	5365561	Huh?
5366141	5366801	Metrosexual?
5367061	5368021	I know, and I'm like, huh?
5369061	5369921	I need to know, though.
5369941	5371062	I like it authentic.
5371422	5374202	I want to know, are they going to be running reruns of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?
5374222	5376683	Because that's pretty metrosexual right there.
5377363	5378243	They should reboot it.
5379238	5380399	Actually, what was Alan telling you?
5397250	5398390	So... No, that's fine.
5398471	5399231	He listens to mine too.
5399611	5401812	But he likes to listen to... He's probably listening now, in fact.
5402872	5404613	He likes to listen to The Nerdist with Chris Harwick.
5404633	5413516	And I guess they've been doing a lot of... Because I guess somebody involved with that show is involved with Attack of the Show right now after Kevin Pereira left and all that.
5413976	5417218	And I guess they say that this network is supposed to be Brovo.
5418078	5419058	Is what they're calling it.
5419078	5419599	Brovo?
5419819	5421379	Instead of Bravo, it's Brovo.
5421799	5422380	So I'm like...
5423380	5425241	The real dude bros of Orange County?
5425321	5426522	What exactly does that mean?
5426642	5428424	What is real dude bros?
5428984	5430625	That would be pretty hilarious.
5430645	5432766	That actually would be a fucking awesome show.
5433887	5434488	Dude!
5434508	5435048	Dude!
5435088	5436569	What are you gonna do, man?
5436589	5436889	Dude!
5436909	5445615	It's there for dudes of, you know... Fist bump, Loki, fist bump!
5445635	5446295	Fist bump, yeah!
5452276	5453017	Moving on.
5455040	5457124	An update to the Humble Bundle.
5457484	5459147	Do you ever fist bump people, DarkSakura?
5459507	5460048	All the time.
5463053	5465817	The Humble THQ Bundle has added...
5466892	5467312	and DarkSakura.com.
5489651	5493873	The Humble THQ Bundle By the way, you don't have to re-buy the bundle to get those games.
5494013	5498775	Just log back in to the Humble Bundle site or reuse your code, whatever.
5499215	5499876	You'll get the games.
5499896	5502357	$2 million earned in 24 hours.
5505358	5528156	6 days to go actually no that was 3 days left about 3.7 million made so it's probably up to about 4 million by now the average price of the bundle $5.58 and as the article here points out 4.5 shares of THQ stock same price amazing
5529986	5537808	I didn't know this was a thing, but more import games apparently still coming to the PlayStation Store in the form of PlayStation 1 Classics.
5538429	5546571	And GungHo Online America getting these old Japanese-only games and repackaging them for the PlayStation 1 Import Store.
5546911	5547892	I think it's a great idea.
5548292	5558055	I don't know if I'd play any of these games, but Zanuck x Zanuck, Kendo Rage sequel Makeruna Makendo 2,
5559715	5579771	Vehicle Cavalier, which was a vehicle combat game with mechs, Art Kamien Sugoro Kuden, that was a board game about Dekotora trucks in Japan, and Loop Salad, which was a match-three puzzle game, and Finger Flashing, which was basically a rock-paper-scissors action game.
5579832	5580572	Not Naked Fingers?
5581113	5581313	No.
5581713	5582674	Finger Flashing.
5583054	5583555	Like that.
5583575	5583855	Okay.
5584916	5588138	I just flashed one of my fingers at DarkSakura.
5588938	5590419	I retorted only to be polite.
5591380	5594662	Streets of Rage apparently at one point had a remake.
5594782	5599405	I don't know what kind of stage this concept was in.
5599445	5601407	This could even be a fan thing for all we know.
5601866	5602666	Thanks for watching!
5618272	5646540	it's a little more open world than side scroller but it has that very neon look to it and you can watch the guys beating each other up there in the video Ubisoft level designer Sean Noonan that was the guy that leaked it through Twitter it was reportedly in development I'm sorry, he confirmed the leak through Twitter he didn't leak it himself reportedly was in development at Ruffian Games there was supposed to be destructible environments takedowns, street gangs
5648092	5649073	But cancelled.
5650294	5650834	Not happening.
5653737	5654717	Guess it just wasn't good enough.
5655858	5656939	Some things are not meant to be.
5659401	5662964	Alright, that does it for my rapid fire news.
5663424	5669269	Well, now, did you ever have a TI calculator?
5669709	5670070	I sure did.
5670090	5671211	The graphing calculators?
5671271	5672772	In AP Calculus, I sure did.
5673174	5674375	Well, I didn't take Calculus.
5674475	5676016	I had one just so I could play Pole Position.
5676876	5678257	And then make it say rude things.
5678337	5681119	I was on my way to take Calculus, and I was in pre-calc.
5681139	5683700	Unfortunately, I spent too much time programming on my calculator.
5683721	5688383	I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game, but... And now we have Dissidia.
5688604	5689104	You should sue.
5689124	5689644	I have to quit.
5690665	5695448	Well, now they've made Portal on a TI-85 calculator.
5696408	5700031	You can actually play kind of a weird version of Portal where...
5701969	5707075	I guess it's like the Flash one, where it's just sort of from the side.
5707976	5711000	I couldn't really tell, the video was not playing on my network.
5711180	5721493	Yeah, it was from the side, and you could shoot portals out in like eight directions, and they actually had puzzles and a little bit of a story that goes along, so it was pretty cool.
5721820	5723341	XBOX LIVE ARCADE NEXT SPRING
5747052	5748914	They will be seeing it.
5749414	5751616	It was one of the Greenlight titles and I have it.
5751696	5752437	It's pretty.
5752697	5754419	I haven't really gotten a chance to play much of it.
5755299	5757962	But we shall be seeing it on Xbox.
5759343	5759643	There you go.
5760644	5762726	Well, that's cool that it made its way to Xbox.
5763146	5764467	Yeah, not bad for Kickstarter, huh?
5764888	5765048	Yeah.
5765657	5767558	It's a fantastic game that I have yet to play.
5768819	5769359	I have it.
5769599	5770019	I have it.
5770119	5770520	I have it too.
5770540	5774982	I bought it because I backed the Kickstarter, but I haven't played it yet.
5777523	5786788	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase cereal, as in breakfast cereal.
5787549	5789130	Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
5797222	5801404	Every week we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook and Google+.
5801464	5804746	You smoosh it together, that's Foogle.
5804926	5808968	This week I was kind of a goober and I forgot to post the question in a timely manner.
5809528	5813670	So as soon as I joined chat they were like, Rob, you have not posted the Foogle question of the week.
5814130	5814570	Don't!
5814871	5815191	Don't!
5815551	5820716	So one of our chatters, Ragenator, just said, here, I'm going to give you a question totally free of charge.
5820796	5821617	I was like, okay.
5822097	5824319	And so Ragenator's asking the Google question this week.
5824740	5830205	What is one thing that you learned, in quotes, from video games over the years?
5830225	5831746	I thought it was a good question.
5831806	5832347	And you know what?
5833027	5834969	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
5835370	5837492	So if one of you wants to ask the question tonight...
5838092	5838612	Go for it.
5839132	5840033	I think it was a great idea.
5840093	5841393	So let's see what the listeners said.
5843714	5846355	Let's start tonight on Google+.
5846995	5848576	We had a couple answers on Google+.
5849936	5855818	Redertainment says, Before Assassin's Creed, I didn't know Leonardo da Vinci was gay.
5856259	5858379	Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.
5859000	5859260	I didn't...
5860300	5863924	Is that true, or is that just a stereotype thing in the game?
5864184	5865625	I think it's a speculation.
5866146	5866646	I see.
5866987	5870350	But then again, you know, that type of thing was punishable by death back then.
5871291	5871872	Unfortunate.
5872312	5873833	Actdeft has an answer.
5874554	5874914	English.
5875655	5879219	Well, I learned the language when I was little, but video games helped me master it.
5879619	5881801	Quite probably the reason I have a B.A.
5881861	5883142	in translation, too.
5884107	5885048	Oh, that's... I hate it.
5912739	5915221	Appreciate music, Actdeft goes on to say.
5915902	5923930	I love music and video games helped me appreciate all kinds of music during my early years and especially during my teens.
5924870	5931577	Without that, probably I wouldn't be doing I love that music, which is a segment on VOGnetwork.com today.
5932157	5934820	I've learned lots of trivial things too, but those two are the most important.
5936021	5937443	Good answers over there on Google+.
5938083	5938964	Let's try Facebook.
5939245	5940646	Quite a few answers on Facebook.
5941347	5943670	They're all pretty short, so I'll try to read as many of these as I can.
5944110	5945692	Reginator answered his own question.
5946513	5954181	I've learned that, quote, herbs, quote, are good for your health, and I think those in Washington State would be inclined to agree.
5955122	5956083	I see the joke there.
5956804	5963911	I mean, really, though, there were a lot of, speaking of early RPGs, it was always the herb that would suddenly make you feel better and just make you forget all the pain.
5963951	5971979	We used to say when you mix the brown, sorry, the red herb and the green herb and you got the brown pile, we would just call it the brown pile or crap.
5972079	5975923	Or you mix the green herb and the pink herb and suddenly you want to watch a lot of My Little Pony.
5976603	5976924	I figure.
5977426	5979406	Nothing will make me want to watch a lot of My Little Pony, Rob.
5981567	5985608	Brandon H. on Facebook said, Don't try to text in the middle of a race.
5986408	5992029	I don't know if that means Mario Kart or like an actual race, but just don't text and drive, kids.
5992409	5993429	Doesn't even work in games.
5995690	6001251	Katsuhiko J. replied and said, Save your game, save often.
6001611	6002631	Ain't that the truth?
6003843	6008107	Surely you've lost progress in Mass Effect due to lack of saving, yes, DarkSakura?
6009168	6010909	No, actually, because I save often.
6011590	6012871	Alright, you learned that lesson, huh?
6013231	6014933	I also have multiple saves at the same place.
6015013	6019316	I have different colors of skin and hair and different hairstyles and eye colors on my Shepard.
6019557	6019817	Nerd.
6020537	6026182	GamerGirl replied and said, Keep calm and keep playing because nothing in a game is as bad as real life.
6026623	6031227	At least, unlike life, in a game, there are do-overs and extra lives.
6032594	6032714	Yes.
6032734	6032794	Yes.
6032814	6032894	Yes.
6060543	6061544	What is the first law of physics?
6061564	6065347	An object in motion tends to stay in motion, sir.
6081761	6082201	I just forgot.
6108632	6111934	BroSiden, I wonder if he'll have a show on Brovo.
6112255	6122842	BroSiden answers and says, don't ever think you're better than the game because the game decides if you're going to win or if it might just freeze and glitch and make your past 36 hours pointless.
6123523	6127666	You need to see the rule earlier, BroSiden, that says save now, save often.
6128972	6137475	Giovedea says, I've learned that when trying to perform operations on the Wii in Trauma Center, it is oftentimes easier to operate while drunk.
6137895	6140136	This makes me question real doctors.
6140976	6143177	Yes, because Trauma Center is real life.
6143697	6147718	Your real doctors draw a pentagram shape in order to invoke the magic.
6151631	6154994	Burr replied and said, I learned you only live once.
6155294	6155815	YOLO.
6157096	6158358	Wait, that can't be right.
6158918	6160740	You missed the one on the three lives.
6161000	6161341	Hello.
6163362	6166284	Cram replied and said, save often.
6166684	6170667	Having to replay several hours can leave a game unfinished for a long time.
6171788	6179213	Loco Poco replied and said, I've learned that flashing your breasts to your opponent is the best kind of fatality to finish them off.
6179793	6182035	Learned from Black Orchid and Killer Instinct.
6184997	6186498	Is that a good life lesson, DarkSakura?
6186878	6189040	Do you flash your breasts at opponents to kill them off?
6189400	6190921	I flash them at Dan to get him to shut up.
6195909	6202590	Silent Tom replies and says, I've learned over the years that the princess is always in another castle.
6203971	6206872	And if you chop down enough grass, you're bound to find money.
6207592	6209532	Those are both good life lessons, wouldn't you say?
6211053	6216114	Haseo Sumerugawa replies and says, If the camera focuses on it, it's important.
6217374	6217934	There it is.
6218074	6220815	So in Dead or Alive, the breasts are important.
6220835	6220935	Yeah.
6222287	6228669	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and you can find our community on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.
6228909	6230209	I did learn something by the way.
6230329	6231529	That was a good question Ragenator.
6231629	6231969	Good job.
6232470	6233450	I learned something last night Rob.
6234210	6237611	My hacked Mass Effect 3 will now work in multiplayer.
6238911	6240311	As long as I don't hit the button.
6242152	6242532	Oh you.
6243072	6243392	Alright.
6244713	6245993	Let's move on with some more news.
6246093	6246333	Loki.
6247256	6257258	So there's been a listing on LinkedIn, their one ads for, I guess, Microsoft's interactive entertainment business studio, Soho.
6257279	6262460	They're seeking a television producer to develop and deliver a number of new TV products.
6263820	6267281	Basically, it says, Soho Productions is pushing the boundaries of Kinect
6267381	6268201	Thanks for watching!
6291773	6295655	So this kind of goes back to a few different rumors.
6295915	6303199	One, that this might be something that's incorporated into the next Xbox system, and also to that whole set-top box thing that they're going to be putting out.
6303939	6316106	To me, it sounds like they're kind of building on the whole Connect TV stuff, like what they did with Sesame Street and Nat Geo, that they're going to be doing some other types of...
6316926	6322709	Interactive TV things, maybe bringing back 1 vs 100 or something like that might be kind of cool.
6324950	6331433	So that's what it sounds like to me, or maybe it's just something else, but hopefully it's not implemented really stupid like...
6332213	6337214	Now you can vote on this, you know, thing or something.
6337534	6339055	Do you like Xbox or not?
6339075	6345056	You know, I think they were doing something similar for the Spike VGAs where they had it where you can stream it and interact with TV and stuff.
6345136	6346777	They were doing it for the political debates.
6347277	6347557	Yeah.
6347777	6348457	On Xbox Live.
6348477	6351278	So maybe they're going to be kind of doing something like that.
6351838	6356359	It seems like the way that they would go, but they're trying to maybe new content, which would be cool.
6356439	6361080	I'm all for new content, especially if it's not any additional cost to me.
6362839	6373765	Well, I think we've known for a while that they're toying with the idea of doing like a Microsoft channel type of thing on Xbox or at least, you know, I don't know, more of that interactive kind of television style content.
6373965	6380729	Although it does seem weird that why would they close inside Xbox only to develop that kind of stuff?
6380749	6381629	That's the weird part.
6382130	6382490	I don't know.
6383330	6386032	But I do think definitely something is in the works there.
6388351	6389553	Is that something that interests you, Loki?
6390474	6402688	Like I said, if it's at no additional cost to me, because I don't pay for cable TV right now, but I do pay for Xbox Live Gold, so it'd be nice if that was included with it.
6403709	6405031	I'd probably watch some stuff on there.
6406877	6410879	All right, going to a service called Playcast.
6411519	6416722	Playcast is an Israel-based company, and they're a cloud gaming service.
6417242	6418863	You can think similar to OnLive.
6419243	6425186	Playcast is live in Portugal, France, and South Korea, which is weird because they're Israel-based, but they're in these other countries.
6425586	6430208	But they are supposed to be launching the service in the United States early next year.
6430728	6431849	It's a cloud service.
6431929	6436011	It streams through set-top boxes, tablets, smartphones, and PCs.
6436591	6440474	Anything that can run Android 4.0 and higher.
6440594	6444376	You do a subscription package that's tailored to a user.
6444897	6445697	Kind of interesting.
6445777	6452962	So like in the service in France right now, there's a package that's more tailored to casual gamers and then one that's tailored at the more hardcore.
6452982	6458606	So it's kind of like you would, I guess since we're talking about TVs and channels, you'd be buying like Comcast, right?
6459066	6466151	When you sign up for their service, you can get like the sports channel package or the entertainment channel package or whatever, movie channels.
6466611	6469792	So kind of taking that idea to cloud gaming service.
6470833	6471473	Interesting.
6472294	6472694	Interesting.
6473514	6481457	Playcast is aiming towards what they call the mid-core market, a group that enjoys gaming but isn't going online in their favorite shooter every day.
6481878	6487260	So maybe not the type of people that listen to this show, but people that still enjoy gaming.
6489245	6517357	apparently if you use multiple devices so like let's say you play on your TV through a PC and then you can now use your phone or tablet as a controller Playcast will instantly recognize the activity when you sign in with the auxiliary device you can create your own skins with the tablet or what have you and customize the look and layout of the interface no word on exactly when this launches in the US of course nothing on subscription prices da da da da da
6517697	6518037	Interesting.
6518057	6518117	Hmm.
6540974	6569936	I don't know I'm not super big on these cloud gaming things and I'm more of the type of gamer where it's like I'll just buy the games I want to play but I can see the idea of you know go after the audience that maybe isn't as hardcore as I am I just don't want to put stuff that I'm paying for in somebody else's hands yeah it depends on the price though if it were super cheap it might be awesome but I kind of doubt it's going to be that cheap Dark Sakura
6570629	6571011	Yes, I have.
6576135	6580779	Well, there is a... I've been reading Japanese release dates for how long on this show?
6580799	6581039	I know.
6581059	6582020	Yes, I've heard of Idolmaster.
6582620	6584162	Rob, it's called leading into a story.
6584242	6584642	Hello.
6584662	6585683	Okay, my bad, my bad.
6585743	6591908	Well, anyway, Namco Bondi registered two different trademarks in Europe.
6592348	6600455	One of them is the Idolmaster and the other is Shiny Festa, which is one of the titles of a recent Idolmaster spinoff that's on the PSP.
6601776	6628691	so maybe we'll be getting Idolmaster I mean that looks like they're going to Europe first but I honestly think that if they did it there they'd do it here don't you think so I mean and really what this says um the the Idolmaster games you basically manage a pop star's career sort of like a Tamagotchi game Shiny Festa is just a rhythm game that sort of follows after Project D.Va
6629226	6630906	Do you have to clean up their poop too?
6630946	6633187	Like Tamagotchi?
6634727	6635808	You have not taken a bath.
6635988	6636468	Go bathe.
6637768	6639068	Okay.
6640209	6640349	No.
6640709	6641649	Bathe slower.
6642569	6643029	Slower.
6643409	6643750	Rub.
6644550	6644930	And hence.
6645650	6646050	And hence.
6646610	6646870	Anyway.
6647791	6648851	So yeah, it could get localized.
6653590	6654711	Alrighty, well, we'll see.
6654811	6655551	I mean, I don't know.
6655991	6665017	Trademark may not, I mean, it may just be preventing another company from coming in and releasing their own game called Idolmaster, but I don't know.
6665837	6667698	You would think there'd be an audience for it here.
6668399	6678364	It's not going to be a huge thing like it is over there, but there's certainly enough people that are into the Japanese culture alone that would want to check it out just because it's been so big over there.
6678384	6682787	It could be a cult game, I think is what they'd call it.
6683464	6683845	Who knows?
6684165	6688010	I mean, we've seen other things happen, you know, games like that gain popularity.
6688892	6690954	I mean, would we have had Elite Beat Agents otherwise?
6691796	6691916	So.
6693849	6694149	Be neat.
6695070	6695350	I don't know.
6695450	6695891	Not my thing.
6698233	6699373	So this is kind of funny.
6699413	6703417	We were talking a little bit about Killer Instinct and boot flashing, so that's awesome.
6703897	6708741	But this may stop another Killer Instinct game coming out.
6709121	6719049	Apparently Microsoft at least tried to renew the trademark of Killer Instinct, but it's been rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
6720456	6722778	on the basis of likelihood of confusion.
6723438	6729743	Apparently, this has to do with a short-lived Fox show called Killer Instinct from 1995.
6730563	6736848	Because I know everybody that you talk about Killer Instinct thinks of the Fox show and not, I don't know, the fighting game series.
6736908	6738009	I've never heard of that show.
6738309	6740711	Somebody at the trademark office did.
6741231	6745894	Yeah, a really obscure person that probably, you know, that's my favorite show!
6746495	6749297	Same person probably also has episodes of Silk Stockings on tape.
6752093	6755520	Silk Stockings was awesome That was some good Skinamax right there
6758590	6762432	and David Duchovny, you rock on.
6762572	6772078	So basically they said that they're probably going to be trying to maybe appeal that or something.
6772238	6772598	I don't know.
6773999	6779582	Right now they said this happens to a lot of trademark applications and by no means is the final say on the application.
6779602	6783645	It just means that Microsoft has to provide more evidence to overcome their objection.
6784258	6786959	I would say, you know, ask the average person on the street.
6787240	6791102	So, Killer Instinct, is that an arcade game or a show from 1995?
6791142	6792743	And they'll be like, what?
6794924	6802267	I'm looking at some clips of Killer Instinct here on, I'm thinking this is the intro to the show or whatever, here on good old YouTube.
6803148	6804489	But yeah, this is the movie.
6804509	6806029	Who does it star?
6806250	6807330	Marguerite Moreau.
6807550	6812593	I don't... It's a lot of nothing in...
6813939	6814619	I miss her too.
6815819	6821960	That's... Totally... What?
6821980	6823921	They're making a game based... They don't even talk.
6823941	6826941	They're making a game based on my favorite show from 1995.
6827021	6828982	That's fantastic.
6829002	6829422	2005, actually.
6829722	6830142	Just so you know.
6830702	6831322	It said 1995.
6832662	6834703	No, it's 2005, that one that I'm looking at there.
6834903	6835003	It's 2005.
6835083	6836103	Oh, really?
6836243	6836403	Yeah.
6837083	6837623	It's wrong.
6838903	6842584	But anyway, the game was 95, wasn't it?
6845449	6846530	Um, maybe?
6846690	6849992	Yeah, it was because I was in college in Alabama.
6850552	6850933	Anyway.
6851093	6852253	Kicking people's asses!
6853394	6862579	Anyway, it's not that they make games based off of shows, like CSI has games, Survivor has games that aren't very good.
6862960	6865761	Wheel of Fortune, you just said, has a game coming out next week.
6866302	6869744	So, surely Killer Instinct, a cancelled show from eight years ago.
6869944	6871004	It was 2005, my mistake, not 1995.
6872205	6881531	Surely a cancelled series from seven years ago might have a game at some point, so therefore... I know, considering that it ran a whole, what, 13 episodes?
6882011	6888174	Wow, people would totally... No, I'm sorry, not even 13 episodes, because four of those episodes were unaired.
6889075	6894118	So, uh... According to GameGuru, sounds like your typical cancelled Fox show.
6894538	6894778	Yes.
6894818	6896239	So nine episodes.
6896279	6898981	Yeah, people are going to totally confuse it for that piece of shit.
6899741	6901062	I'm sure, you know.
6902116	6908838	We would get a Wonderfalls video game before we would get a Killer Instinct video game based off the show.
6909878	6911098	I'm pretty sure this will be appealing.
6911118	6912779	Oh my god, you know what this sounds like?
6912799	6917540	This sounds like a really crappy rip-off of Law & Order SVU.
6917560	6918700	Probably is.
6918720	6923021	They're part of the, get this, the Deviant Crimes Unit, the DCU.
6926022	6927703	Yeah, the DCU.
6928784	6931525	Totally not a ripoff of the SVU.
6931545	6936787	Well, it just goes to show that intellectual property laws in this country are kind of borked.
6937168	6943751	I mean, technically, by the same logic, this show shouldn't have existed in the first place because of the game.
6944994	6945514	Thanks for watching!
6968021	6969502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6987697	6993681	An 8-bit fan game had a little preview this week, the Mega Man 25th anniversary.
6994462	7003628	This is a Canadian-based group, Team Reaverbot, but it's kind of a Voltron of various people here.
7003968	7011414	You have Julian Spillane from DHX Media or Silicon Knights, Jason Kanam from Drinkbox Studios,
7012094	7020217	Ori Falconer and Daniel Ochoa from Vast Studios and Tim McLennan from Gameloft and then an independent artist, Jeff Canan.
7020638	7028141	So this is, you know, again, it's kind of your basic NES throwback, but with like all new bosses and I can play a little preview here.
7029421	7035444	You know, it's not all that different from Mega Man 9 and 10, because people seem to love their retro Mega Mans.
7035964	7041006	But, like, see, that guy actually shoots acid, which is in line with the theme stage here.
7041746	7043567	They even have all new bosses, right?
7043607	7052531	Like, there's actually Sledge Man, Bio Man, Taro Man, Kendo Man, Amp Man, Neon Man, Comet Man, and Totem Man.
7053035	7053696	Street Fighter X Mega Man
7075632	7076132	Actually, yes.
7076212	7077252	Yes, that's what it is.
7077792	7079933	This was also something that was announced.
7080013	7081313	This is a little more official.
7081693	7084154	That other one was more of a like indie, whatever.
7084254	7085614	This is a little more official.
7086114	7086974	Sort of, though.
7087094	7092676	The interesting thing about this, this project, the Street Fighter X Mega Man, has been going on for a while.
7092776	7097457	And you can find the guy's YouTube channel and find these old concept videos from like three years ago.
7097497	7099357	So this has been being worked on for quite some time.
7099938	7116500	at some point Capcom caught wind of it because now Capcom is going to be the ones that are sending it out through their Unity blog the Capcom Unity blog and they're going to make it a free download on December 17th, 2012 you know for all the shit
7117461	7120743	that Capcom gets for pissing off their fanbase over the past year.
7121184	7126647	This is a very interesting kind of band-aid to try and make it right with the community.
7127168	7134073	Because, you know, they see this indie project's going on and for all practical purposes they have every right to shut the damn thing down.
7135069	7140815	But they've learned from watching what happens to other stuff when that goes on that this is going to get out there to the internet anyway.
7141256	7148424	So let's embrace it, give the guy a little guidance, and then give it out as a goodwill thing for free and end up giving the guy some exposure.
7149064	7149965	And it looks kind of neat.
7150826	7155712	It kind of does the whole parody of Mega Man 2 here in the intro, but...
7156393	7167529	You can see, like, Ryu's stage, and it even does these interesting things where, like, the bosses have, because they're Street Fighter characters, have, like, super meters.
7167549	7168109	It's crazy.
7169881	7176166	The bosses have, like, super meters, and once they fill up, it'll do, like, this little zoom in, and they do their super attack.
7176186	7176907	It's kind of funny.
7177567	7183812	I was watching some of the old concept videos online, so... It's really neat that it came to life.
7184673	7189056	I kind of wonder if the guy got any help officially from Capcom, or what.
7190778	7191458	I don't know.
7192479	7193800	Well, you can get it free on December 17th.
7196753	7200795	By the way, the super fan behind this, Sonic is the name he uses online.
7201395	7203076	Xiao Zong Hui.
7203556	7206097	He's a pro-competitive gamer, additionally.
7206978	7207418	Very cool.
7207638	7208859	Yay, I love this music.
7212180	7214361	The old end-of-game music.
7214941	7217562	You know, Brental Floss did lyrics to it.
7218363	7218783	Of course.
7220564	7224806	Anyway, I love looking at the little chibi Street Fighter characters done up in Mega Man style.
7224846	7225506	I think that's awesome.
7227136	7247619	so alright going back to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com GameGuru commented on that last story about Killer Instinct saying that the TV show came out right as Nintendo let that Killer Instinct trademark expire so a small correction to me getting angry there a minute ago good to know
7249188	7257116	Dark Tetsuya in chat talking on this Capcom Mega Man thing says, yeah, the way Capcom handled that made me even more interested in checking it out.
7257196	7259298	I'm always down for more retro Mega Man.
7260800	7264984	Panaxium in chat says, I'd play it if my reflexes weren't shit.
7265364	7266185	I'm getting old.
7267306	7268207	Yeah, you and me both.
7269946	7271228	Hopefully there's an easy mode.
7272649	7274571	Like Mega Man 2 style easy mode.
7275112	7276213	Alright, more news.
7276333	7277154	DarkSakura.
7278256	7278496	News?
7278596	7278977	Oh, I'm sorry.
7278997	7279657	We're to the mailbag.
7279898	7280318	Yeah.
7280959	7284263	Well, the news is you all emailed us and now we're going to give you answers.
7284283	7284863	Fucking hell.
7285564	7294652	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna dive in the mailbag headfirst and pick out a few emails.
7295232	7300016	And we were actually kind of, like, some weeks we get no emails whatsoever.
7300436	7301677	This week, we got a bunch.
7301858	7302818	All the emails!
7302979	7303659	All the emails.
7303719	7307322	So DarkSakura, I think, can only read some tonight, but she's gonna pick some and read them.
7307342	7307823	I'll go through them.
7308383	7308803	Goodie.
7309044	7311546	Searcher here, what are the good games?
7311766	7313167	I don't know, what are the good games?
7314648	7315529	Is that the whole sentence?
7315749	7315929	No.
7316209	7316770	Oh.
7316870	7317831	I like JRPGs.
7317851	7322735	I have Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, and Animal Crossing Wild World, which I guess that isn't really a JRPG.
7322795	7324596	It's more of a kind of a sim, I guess.
7325357	7326438	What are other good games?
7326738	7328199	What do you think if the world ends with you?
7328539	7329080	Love the show.
7330702	7339608	I'm gonna guess he left out a sentence for the DS Because all those games he named are DS games, right?
7339868	7342509	I guess So what are good DS games?
7342529	7354777	Dan likes Fire Emblem I mean, that's more of a strategy RPG You know what game is surprisingly good is the Card House one The Clubhouse games, that's what it is Clubhouse games was really good
7355117	7357138	Maybe it's looking specifically for JRPGs.
7358218	7360519	I mean, you could play Final Fantasy 3, Final Fantasy 4.
7360920	7365141	Yeah, the Final Fantasy 4, 3 and 4 remakes are really good on DS.
7365582	7371204	By the way, side story, did you hear about Final Fantasy 4 is getting its iOS release like Final Fantasy 3 did?
7371584	7371784	Good.
7371984	7376987	Final Fantasy 4 is going to be coming out for what, Android and iPad and iPhone and all that stuff?
7377067	7377447	Android.
7378227	7378887	I'm just saying.
7379448	7382509	It's coming out for all those systems before the end of the year, I think.
7382609	7383269	At least in Japan.
7384270	7384390	So...
7385270	7385871	Next email.
7386531	7387312	Howdy, OLR.
7387372	7388893	It's your favorite catastrophic moggy.
7389273	7391155	Unfortunately, this week I come bearing sad news.
7391295	7396099	Unlike every other time I've emailed recently where I bitch about release dates for certain games, or lack thereof.
7397560	7403424	I'm sure the name will mean little to you, but earlier today, Sir Patrick Moore passed away at the age of 89.
7403924	7408588	He was best known as an astronomer and the host of the long-winning BBC TV show, The Sky at Night.
7409989	7410389	Total goodbyes.
7438033	7442096	I never saw it, so I don't have that emotional attachment, but I can imagine.
7442116	7444477	I knew who he was as an astronomer.
7444737	7447219	Imagine the day when Mark Summers passes away.
7447359	7448740	We are all going to have a cry.
7449220	7451161	We're all going to throw green slime at you.
7452242	7453402	You know what's funny about Mark Summers?
7453543	7453743	Huh?
7454343	7456985	He was pathologically... Yeah, OCD.
7458024	7461567	Yeah, as far as things, he hated dirty anything.
7462808	7463689	Hey, it was a job.
7464449	7468953	By the way, going back to the DS email, Meteos is like my favorite DS game.
7468973	7470234	It's a puzzler and it's great.
7470634	7471735	See, I have my Puyo Puyo.
7472115	7474938	It's not a JRPG, sorry, but Meteos is great.
7474958	7476099	I'm just saying it's a great game.
7476519	7479481	Since he left out a sentence in that email, I'm just going to make up what it said.
7480622	7481423	Way to assume, Rob.
7481923	7482644	Yes, that's what I do.
7483206	7489431	Next up, hello OLR crew, this is Ramaditya from Indonesia.
7489551	7490312	I think that's actually right.
7490572	7493475	This email is probably rather personal because we are fellow gamers.
7493855	7495756	I think that's alright for me to ask your blessings.
7495897	7496977	Yes, I just got married.
7497358	7497838	Congrats.
7498819	7500761	I write this email soon after the party is over.
7500841	7501701	It's December the 9th.
7503563	7504103	Wait a minute.
7504804	7509808	When the marriage and the celebration and the party is over, don't email your favorite podcast.
7510409	7511589	Get to the baby making.
7513126	7513766	Consumate.
7516967	7517467	Consumate.
7517587	7519288	I'm going to assume he meant after all of that.
7519328	7519548	Yeah.
7520588	7524029	I know that marriage is such a common thing, but for me it is special.
7524749	7527230	What I mean is how it will make my gaming life special.
7527430	7530371	As a blind person like me, it is very difficult to enjoy video games.
7530811	7533612	An 8-bit, 16-bit era were the only great memories I could remember.
7534172	7536013	It is fortunate that my wife is also a gamer.
7536773	7537474	Thank you for watching!
7556636	7558557	The way I will play the game is like this.
7558697	7562380	She will explain to me what to do and I will play it with my game in the controller.
7562420	7564401	For example, go left, don't go right, etc.
7565462	7567863	That way, for instance, I can still play Galaxian and so on.
7568264	7571125	Our best collaboration was when we finished Contra with 30 lives code.
7572066	7572827	Well, that's all for now.
7572927	7577610	I hope this little story can inspire other people, even with disabilities, that they can still enjoy video games.
7577910	7579751	P.S.
7580251	7582253	We'll send you real-time video of how I play games.
7582713	7583173	P.P.S.
7583453	7584834	This is a little pic for my marriage party.
7585114	7585895	Oh, I'm going to look at it.
7586621	7587222	I tried to look at it.
7587262	7588423	It was blocked on Facebook.
7588484	7589885	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
7590727	7591908	We would love to enjoy your photo.
7592048	7593731	I think that story is so cute, though.
7593931	7594211	It is.
7594351	7596114	I mean, it's just... That's great.
7597115	7597996	I love that story.
7598176	7598477	I do.
7600159	7600840	You and Dan...
7601921	7605224	You told me you guys kind of do something similar too in your relationship.
7605584	7609407	You're not facing a disability on the severity of blindness.
7609687	7611388	I face motion sickness.
7611809	7613270	Well, yeah, that's a thing.
7613430	7616172	And your ergonomic thing with your hand.
7616192	7617172	Well, this was before my hand.
7617533	7617793	Okay.
7618153	7621696	But we would play Resident Evil 2 and I'd walk them through the game with the strategy guide.
7621956	7624038	I mean, because I couldn't watch the screen all the time.
7624078	7625158	I'd get a little motion sick.
7625378	7627660	But it's something we would do together.
7629161	7630022	Okay, so moving forward.
7630342	7632363	Alan and I leveled characters in Warcraft together.
7632383	7632944	At least we did.
7633544	7635165	We did his first character.
7635185	7636145	What about our paladins?
7637506	7638327	Our paladin pals?
7639047	7640468	You and I aren't in a relationship.
7640508	7641388	No, I'm just kidding.
7642029	7643189	Our paladin pals were fun.
7643229	7644370	They can be friends.
7644930	7647292	Shane and I have leveled at least three characters together.
7647312	7648893	It's a fun friend thing to do, too.
7648953	7650514	I need someone to finish leveling.
7650534	7652395	We just set a time and we'll do it.
7652515	7654536	Help me level my stupid troll character.
7655898	7657159	God, anyway.
7657199	7659762	Wait, Loki, do you and Nellie do any bonding thing?
7659782	7660463	Oh, please.
7662065	7662645	Come on.
7662665	7664207	You play the game and she mocks you.
7664227	7668251	What was she asking the other night?
7668271	7671395	She's like, I don't know, like, what are you doing?
7671755	7673557	I'm like, I'm hunting dingoes.
7675279	7676180	Did they eat your baby?
7676934	7677575	I don't really care.
7677595	7677735	I know.
7692265	7694107	Hey gang, I just thought I would drop a line and say hey.
7694647	7694947	Hey.
7695768	7699672	Watched the VGAs last night and I must say I was very impressed with the Game of the Year winner.
7700332	7702494	I just finished The Walking Dead about two weeks ago.
7702734	7708900	I found myself finishing an episode or sitting in my office and pondering whether the decisions I made were the right ones.
7709440	7710961	And that's when you know you've played a great game.
7711522	7717607	So good work, Telltale, for beating the Call of Duty's Borderlands and all the other big name AAA games.
7718127	7718868	Goes to show what you...
7720089	7721931	Yes, I have played Sleeping Dogs.
7739335	7743238	I just started playing after picking it up on the Steam Thanksgiving sale and I'm pretty blown away.
7743658	7748021	I didn't have a very high expectation when I started it, yet I am having a blast playing it.
7748942	7751544	So check it out if you haven't and if you have, what did you think?
7752444	7755006	I thought it was pretty fun, although I got bored of it pretty quick.
7756807	7762371	Now everyone stop what you're doing and it should be Y-O-U apostrophe R-E, not Y-O-U-R.
7762552	7764173	I will correct everyone who does this.
7764980	7766441	Grammar Lessons with DarkSakura
7779094	7782418	And if you haven't yet, go play The Walking Dead.
7782959	7783840	Oh, one more thing.
7784060	7786743	After I complete Dogs That Aren't Awake, I'm going to pick up Far Cry 3.
7787504	7788825	I wasn't a fan of 2, though.
7788925	7790307	I have it on PS3 and Steam.
7790707	7794331	Just didn't find it appealing, so if any of you have played 2 or 3, your thoughts, por favor.
7794612	7795713	Keep up the good work, Travis.
7796792	7799013	That's a Loki question as far as Far Cry goes.
7799153	7800173	I didn't play Far Cry.
7800233	7803774	Walking Dead, I'm making it a point I will play that before the end of the year.
7803874	7808535	I'm not going to name a game of the year until I've at least played that because that's what everybody really seems to be into.
7808675	7810215	I'm making it a point to play more Mass Effect 3.
7812076	7813276	That's a pretty dull point.
7813816	7814456	You know what?
7815197	7815817	Yeah, go ahead.
7815837	7816637	I have a butt bite it.
7817546	7817986	Yes, Loki.
7819527	7820367	Far Cry 3 is awesome.
7820668	7822388	What about 2?
7822809	7828011	2, I didn't play because the same reason why I didn't like Dead Rising.
7828411	7829992	You have malaria in the game.
7830412	7833874	So you have to constantly give yourself medication bullshit like that.
7834454	7835054	I don't like that.
7835494	7838016	Dead Rising 2 sucked because of that crap.
7838396	7840037	And then I got Dead Rising 2 off the record.
7840057	7841137	I'm like, oh, sweet.
7841457	7844739	I'm not going to worry about the stupid having to get medicine for a stupid girl.
7845459	7851104	Oh, but then, guess what, Frank West, he has the problem, and he needs to get the fucking Zombrex for himself.
7851164	7857248	I'm like, gone, get rid of this game, because it's absolute shit.
7858309	7861612	So, no, I do not enjoy games that you have malaria in.
7862332	7864774	But Far Cry 3 is awesome, because you do not have malaria in that.
7866696	7868657	Malaria-free games are awesome.
7869658	7869978	Exactly.
7869998	7870579	Exactly.
7871263	7873044	I should call in sick to work with malaria.
7874205	7877368	Sorry Mosquito bit me even though they're, you know, in larval stage right now.
7879169	7882552	Hey guys, I'm a new listener and I've got to say that you guys have one awesome show.
7882732	7883112	Thank you.
7883432	7883893	Well, thanks.
7884233	7888636	I've only been listening for a few weeks and I already feel like you guys are close friends that I've known forever.
7889137	7889477	Yay.
7890318	7892900	I've had very similar problems and in my life I...
7894471	7895452	I've been having headaches.
7895532	7897233	My cat, Stripes, just passed away.
7897293	7897773	I'm sorry.
7898894	7903277	And I've always, and he always laid in my lap while I played Minecraft and Xbox.
7903357	7907960	But the point is that you have a great way to make the show feel like a great chat with friends and keep up the good work.
7909061	7909801	That was our goal.
7910422	7911462	Mission accomplished!
7911522	7912283	Yeah, exactly.
7912363	7913123	Mission accomplished.
7913143	7915465	Thank you for validating exactly what we sent out to do.
7915925	7924191	We wanted this podcast to be exactly what dinner after playing DDR at the arcade for a night was, which was just sitting around,
7924732	7928778	Talkin' some smack, havin' a good time, bein' bros, right, Jamie?
7929179	7930140	Yeah, brofist.
7930180	7930942	Brofist.
7931182	7931843	Do bros.
7933346	7937512	You know, every time you say that, though, I think of John's WoW character, Bro Dude.
7937673	7938834	Bro Dude.
7939746	7943029	I almost made girl chick, just to be funny.
7943049	7943469	You should have.
7943729	7945571	I should have, but no one's ever on that server.
7946071	7948673	But anyhow, thank you for validating what we're trying to do.
7948933	7949094	Yes.
7949114	7949574	Appreciate it.
7950695	7951595	Greetings, OLR.
7951655	7952876	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7953597	7960322	Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.
7960362	7961903	His fried bologna hole?
7962124	7963124	Is that what he called it?
7963345	7963645	Yeah.
7963665	7963865	Yeah.
7966766	7967807	Equating it to WoW.
7968067	7971589	You completely missed the fact that WoW is always updating and adding new things to the game.
7972089	7980254	Do you think that anything resembling logic runs through his brain before he opens his fried bologna hole without comparing COD to other games?
7980814	7984576	Do you think they have a right or should charge for online play?
7984636	7987838	Fun fact, I don't play either COD or WoW as I hate them both.
7988018	7989819	Um, um, um, um.
7990399	7992960	Games do charge for online play.
7993520	7995941	Have you missed the online pass train?
7996841	7998641	Did you forget about that?
7999221	8000042	That was the thing.
8000062	8000722	What was he talking about?
8000742	8002102	Games charging for online play?
8002742	8004423	Read the first part of the email again.
8005003	8011825	Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer, equating it to WoW.
8012659	8015081	Well, I agree with that in one state.
8015261	8016002	Only one reason.
8016062	8020986	I think if they went throughout where... Because a lot of people just buy it for the multiplayer.
8021327	8028753	In which case, if they sold it like Killzone, where they have the multiplayer version that you can buy for $15.
8030535	8031235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8051175	8051775	Thanks for watching!
8072001	8074003	8 million copies sold is just ridiculous.
8074023	8078828	You don't charge to play online when you're already charging to play online on the Xbox.
8078868	8080229	That's what Xbox Gold is.
8080389	8086295	I'm telling you, the minute I get double dipped for this shit, my Xbox is going for sale on eBay.
8086475	8087816	I'll even autograph it.
8088156	8088837	It's gone.
8089057	8089398	I don't
8090018	8091159	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8121856	8123077	Oh, I see what you did there.
8123237	8123997	All right, moving on.
8124778	8125958	Oh, no.
8126158	8126739	Is there more email?
8126979	8127179	No.
8127779	8129500	Yeah, there is, but there was more to that one.
8129660	8130361	Yes.
8130501	8131701	It says, Good day, citizens.
8131862	8132542	Serious turtle.
8133547	8133647	Oh.
8134868	8137348	And this is the last email that matters.
8138149	8138569	I'm kidding.
8139689	8151473	I'm sure achievements and trophies aren't such a big thing for you guys, but do you sort of wish Steam's achievements added up to an overall gamerscore as with Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network, or even iOS slash Mac Game Center?
8151633	8157095	And that comes from Robert M. It'd be okay, but it's not a deal breaker.
8157155	8157816	I don't really care.
8158636	8161177	Like, are we talking like a unified achievement system?
8162335	8167359	That's kind of what the website Raptor tries to do a little bit.
8167580	8169801	R-A-P-T-R, I think it's spelled.
8170362	8172544	That's kind of what they're trying to do with their site.
8172624	8177008	I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but they try to track all your gaming accomplishments.
8177028	8185395	It didn't track my game progress in Grand Theft Auto 4, although I know it's retroactive, but I played the fuck out of Grand Theft Auto 4 and it says I haven't played it at all.
8185515	8186716	Was that on 360?
8186836	8187077	Yes.
8187277	8190500	That's weird because it picks up all my Mass Effect activity and all that stuff.
8190540	8193863	Yeah, but stuff that you'd play before you joined Raptor or during?
8194124	8195325	I thought it picked up the before.
8195425	8196126	Not the hours.
8196146	8197627	It doesn't pick up the hours from before.
8197687	8200130	It should have because I played the fuck out of that.
8200770	8202312	I'll tell you what, I hate the crap out of Origin.
8203911	8225138	I do too which is why I always at least run my Mass Effect 3 through Steam so that it'll pop up through Steam and then Origin I'm not sure there's a way to really unify all that though unfortunately like sorry to the emailer but I think some people are trying to create online I've heard of a gaming social network and I can't remember the name that I think is aspiring to do something very similar as well
8225558	8234805	So you have these different startups that are kind of competing to fill that void of your universal gaming badge, but nobody's really cracked into the mainstream yet.
8234865	8238427	I mean, Raptor's probably the biggest one I can think of, but they're not a Twitter.
8238467	8239628	They're not a Facebook yet.
8239668	8244371	They're still very, very niche, and I bet a lot of gamers still haven't heard of them.
8245232	8254919	Hitstun in chat says, Raptor's pretty nice, but there's plenty of stuff it doesn't track, like Minecraft with third-party launchers, and it tries to make you use their shitty web browser, but the stats are nice.
8255800	8258264	So there you have it.
8258685	8259126	That's it.
8259206	8263874	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you wish to send us emails in the future.
8266238	8267681	This is the part of the show where we get angsty.
8286166	8294548	I actually can't really say anything about it, so it's a blanket F you to a situation that I really can't do much about right now.
8295648	8295968	Loki!
8296668	8298189	I hear you're being so expensive.
8299009	8309051	I'm actually looking, I was just real quickly going through Newegg to see if I could create one of those Alienware PCs that they have for cheaper than obviously they offer them, and yeah, you probably can.
8310424	8313528	But it's still expensive.
8313808	8314850	F you to latkes.
8315230	8316812	Do you know how fat you've made me tonight?
8317493	8317753	No.
8317994	8321058	Do you know how many hours on the treadmill I won't spend burning this off?
8321518	8321778	No.
8323280	8324502	Rob, potassium.
8325663	8326284	I eat bananas.
8327025	8328207	Actually, potatoes have more potassium.
8334167	8335048	Unify me a study.
8335268	8336129	A scientific study.
8337591	8345540	Alright, let's do a couple more news stories and then we'll go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8345560	8348003	But not just yet, we do have a couple more stories for you guys.
8348944	8349185	Loki.
8349605	8358048	Yes, because you know, Hitman has had its share of really bad marketing ideas, and well, there's yet another one.
8358108	8364290	Apparently they had a Facebook promotion where you can do a higher Hitman app.
8364910	8374057	For Facebook, what it basically did was it allowed you to create these hits on different people.
8374237	8380962	And of course, some of the reasons, I guess, Target identified by, and then there's a drop-down box, reason for target elimination.
8381482	8391270	So some of the target identified by things are her small tits, or her muffin top, or her hairy legs, or her ginger hair, and that kind of stuff.
8391770	8392771	Some ridiculous things.
8394893	8396374	Apparently people took offense to that.
8396874	8397535	Oh, you think?
8397935	8398155	Yeah.
8398816	8401098	And then... Imagine that, Loki.
8401839	8405722	I can't possibly imagine how this could have possibly been offensive.
8406022	8409746	Putting a hit out on your friend because they have hairy legs and small tits.
8410526	8412328	I can't... I mean...
8414637	8415698	The Madness of it all.
8441872	8445173	And then I guess when they are killed, it tells the reason why.
8445653	8452575	You know, because Bob thought that your tits were small and that you were cheating on your partner or some garbage like that.
8454075	8462197	And I guess... Yeah, I guess people were kind of offended by that.
8462697	8465118	And of course, we're sorry for any offense caused by this.
8465498	8465718	Like...
8466823	8467424	DarkSakura
8491485	8503655	Imagine you woke up this week and imagine you go on Facebook and you check Facebook and you see a little thing that says Rob Roberts has put out a hit on you because you're a bitch and you smell.
8504696	8506197	How would you have responded to that?
8506598	8507599	I'm going to cut that hooker.
8509500	8510301	I cut that bitch.
8510982	8513564	DarkSakura apparently approved the app, ladies and gentlemen.
8513604	8514384	No, I don't.
8514484	8514985	No, I don't.
8517006	8545531	I would cut a bitch though you would have written a 10 page paragraph about what bullshit that was as your status update I wouldn't I just ask people to explain certain social conventions that I find baffling SSJ100Matt says the fact that Square Enix dropped this so quickly tells me it was mostly behind their ad agency yeah I would think so
8547379	8555226	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I'm guessing the team involved had zero women on it, or the few women they had were shut out or ignored.
8555626	8557648	Now, to be fair... You mean like DC Comics?
8558809	8563572	He's probably right, but just because I have to ask this, because I want to know the full story.
8564033	8568676	Could I put a hit out on a man for having small tits and hairy legs?
8569037	8569837	I think you could.
8570418	8573000	I don't know if they would have those options, maybe.
8573040	8574121	They might, you know...
8574341	8575742	You do have rather small boobs, Rob.
8575782	8580005	Maybe they would sort them out because of, you know, by gender.
8580465	8581426	They might have different things.
8582127	8584448	But, you know, maybe small penis.
8585069	8585829	Okay, right, right.
8585849	8586670	Maybe, I don't know.
8588091	8589192	Still not smart.
8590913	8591714	Don't mishear me.
8591734	8594095	Because of his large penis.
8594876	8597118	I put out a hit on him because his penis is too large.
8597798	8598739	That was it.
8600720	8601421	Do you know her?
8601461	8602541	Her dick is so little.
8603042	8603122	No.
8605166	8608271	Actually, I don't think it's even that necessarily it had zero women on it.
8608371	8610875	It had zero people that like...
8612475	8615697	are in the demographic they're trying to target.
8616337	8620560	I think that's the biggest problem with things like this.
8620720	8628304	You can just imagine all these old fuddy-duddies sitting in a room talking about what's cool and what's hip and what the youngsters are into.
8628324	8630725	I'm hip, I'm cool.
8630885	8632946	Exactly.
8633146	8639630	If you had shown this to anybody, you would have been told, it's stupid.
8642159	8644200	It's dumb.
8645501	8645801	Alright.
8646562	8647122	Moving on.
8647602	8651465	Well, good on them shutting it down as fast as they did, but lesson learned.
8652385	8654807	Screen that shit before it goes live.
8655747	8659169	Just saying.
8659269	8660130	This is interesting.
8661638	8665781	Have you ever heard of a VRC6 cartridge back in the days, NES?
8666721	8669323	VRC, Memory Management Controller Chip.
8669363	8673005	It was something that Konami had on Famicom cartridges.
8673065	8677828	It would add three extra sound channels, allowing for richer audio.
8677888	8678989	Here's an example.
8680790	8684112	Here's what Castlevania III sounds like in the U.S., in the NES.
8688965	8693009	But here's what it sounded like on the Famicom because of the three extra sound channels.
8693169	8694069	I love this version too.
8701656	8702477	Very different, huh?
8702497	8703838	You should hear how The Legend of Zelda sounds.
8703858	8708261	Did you know how many fucking games were dumbed down with the sound because of it?
8710152	8711113	This is really cool.
8711253	8713234	A chiptune artist named RushJet1.
8713954	8715574	We've had his stuff on the station before.
8715615	8716875	I know this guy.
8717095	8722297	He has used the VR6 chip to remake the Mega Man 3 soundtrack.
8722697	8725198	Now, Mega Man 3 was already fucking awesome, right?
8725498	8727799	Okay, so here's an example.
8728159	8730700	Here's Magnet Man's original theme.
8731441	8732121	This is the original.
8739898	8740499	A good song.
8740840	8741360	I remember that.
8741400	8741721	All right.
8742201	8745866	Here is Rush Jet One's VRC6 version.
8749470	8750451	Here we go.
8762658	8764100	So it's a little bit remixed, too.
8764140	8766744	He didn't just take the original and overlay it.
8766804	8768706	He just completely kind of redid it.
8769227	8772030	So that's really cool.
8772251	8780061	He actually played through Mega Man 3 with the audio silenced, laid his tunes on top of the game footage.
8780581	8783765	And then when he gets to Wiley's Castle, it even goes through.
8783805	8786409	So it's awesome, this whole little video that's out there.
8787290	8788992	Proto Man's theme, everything is there.
8789513	8794680	So you can check that out at rushjet1.bandcamp.com where he distributes a lot of his stuff.
8795260	8795801	Very cool.
8796943	8797363	Very cool.
8798996	8807001	Yeah, so I mean, gosh, I want to go back and replay all these old games on a Famicom emulator just to hear how awesome the sounds were.
8807061	8810783	You really should hear the differences between the different versions of The Legend of Zelda.
8811684	8813745	It really is kind of night and day.
8814125	8817387	Well, let me open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8817527	8819929	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8820489	8823011	And while we wait for some calls, let me see if I can bring that up here.
8824386	8825426	I think that you can find it.
8825627	8834590	I mean, it's really just the fact that there was a little bit different instrumentalization on the two different ones, so... Let's see.
8839652	8840352	The disc version.
8840533	8841573	Yeah, this is the disc version.
8846915	8848556	It's going through the title screen and all that stuff.
8848696	8848856	Yeah.
8848876	8848956	Yeah.
8853487	8853787	Normal.
8853988	8854908	Oh, yeah.
8855149	8856430	I guess we'd have to get to, like, the dungeon.
8856450	8857991	Let me fast forward a little bit.
8858332	8859353	But it's a lot richer.
8859413	8859793	Oh, yeah.
8859873	8861495	You can even hear an extra little ding.
8862296	8864117	Let me see if we can get to the dungeon.
8866119	8866500	There we go.
8866640	8867641	You hear the difference in the sound?
8867661	8868642	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8872161	8875283	So it's mostly, it's not so much music, but it's a sound effect.
8875303	8876443	Oh yeah, you can hear it in that.
8876463	8881486	But actually, if it had allowed to play through the intro, it would have sounded different.
8881626	8881806	Neat.
8881826	8883346	Well, let me go to the phones, because we're getting some calls.
8883667	8884567	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8884587	8885007	Who's this?
8886168	8887048	Hi, it's Panaxium.
8887168	8888889	Hey, oh, another video caller.
8888949	8890010	What's up, Panaxium?
8890710	8890970	Hey.
8891250	8892891	Hi, you can't see me, but I'm waving.
8894699	8895139	What's up?
8895379	8897040	Rob, you're a special, special person.
8897220	8897780	I know, I know.
8898300	8899020	What's on your mind, buddy?
8899241	8902502	I was actually calling to see if you guys had heard of Starbound.
8903342	8904142	Starbound.
8904242	8904482	Why?
8905463	8907923	This has to be like an Earthbound fan sequel, right?
8908904	8909424	Actually, no.
8909484	8911265	It's the spiritual successor to Terraria.
8911925	8912545	Really?
8912665	8913145	Okay.
8913645	8914426	No, tell me about it.
8914526	8915006	Tell me more.
8916082	8924387	It's actually going to be set very sci-fi, so you're going to be able to visit other planets and stuff, and each planet's going to have a different ecosystem and monsters and things like that.
8925167	8926908	So far it looks like it's going to be really cool.
8926929	8927609	I love Terraria.
8927629	8929090	I don't know if you guys had a chance to try it.
8929250	8930050	I have tried it.
8930491	8932452	I prefer Minecraft, I've got to say.
8932812	8936154	Terraria really did not tell me what to do.
8936954	8938374	I tried to get into it and could not.
8938494	8943896	Yeah, but I went back and played it after I enjoyed Minecraft and I was like, alright, I see why people get into this.
8943916	8948136	Because it's like, if Minecraft were on the Super Nintendo, this is what it would be.
8949457	8950237	And that was pretty cool.
8951397	8952137	Yeah, pretty much.
8952297	8958979	And the new ones, they have the graphics, they have the variety of things you can get and do and different races you can play as.
8959079	8960559	It seems really cool.
8962000	8964181	Is it by the same people who did the original Terraria?
8964201	8965522	Yeah, it's the same group.
8965782	8966783	They've expanded it though.
8966803	8967923	There's more people working on it.
8968243	8968684	Oh, nice.
8970204	8974206	Well, I'm glad the first game worked out so well for them that they can actually do a sequel.
8974246	8974927	That's got to be good.
8976828	8981630	And it actually led me to a question and I thought I'd kind of pass it along to you guys to get your opinion.
8981830	8982031	Sure.
8983431	8990275	Do you think that this will ever move from being an indie type game with like Minecraft and Terraria towards being a big project game?
8992020	8994162	Anything's possible in this day and age.
8995043	9002849	You see things like the Gianna Sisters game started as a Project Greenlight thing and now it's an Xbox Live Arcade.
9003530	9006292	I suppose a lot of it is what do the developers want?
9007053	9008654	What are they kind of willing to do?
9009315	9010275	Sometimes people...
9011036	9015978	Don't really want to play by the rules that systems like Xbox Live and so forth might set out.
9016598	9023960	I think we've all heard the stories before about the patching on Xbox Live and how it costs all this money if you want to do a patch beyond the first one.
9024340	9025901	And it's really turned some people off.
9026221	9028001	They won't patch Fez because of it, right?
9028161	9028941	Yeah, it's too expensive.
9028961	9030522	That's the whole big thing behind it.
9031022	9034305	Now, Nintendo's changing that up a little bit.
9034345	9035806	We reported on that a couple weeks ago.
9035866	9038107	We have yet to see the impact of that, if it works.
9038528	9044472	But Nintendo's really trying to woo the indies towards Wii U by not charging a fee for any of that stuff.
9045313	9049156	So it could be very interesting to see kind of where they'll end up.
9049956	9071358	um I guess at the end of the day it just depends I mean do they think they can create the gaming experience they want on those systems I don't know I seem to remember Terraria made pretty good use of the keyboard so maybe they're worried about putting the uh controller into that environment I don't know but um
9073039	9084925	it's a risk worth taking but they have to decide if financially it's one that they'll get the downloads from but if the community demands it you never know what might happen
9086124	9086785	Yeah, exactly.
9086905	9092729	I mean, those cooperative collaboration games where you're building and exploring together, those are my kind of game.
9092749	9097152	I always liked them, so I'm hoping that they get more exposure and more games made in that style.
9097252	9102936	Well, and that's the type of stuff that seems to really do well on Xbox Live Indie games, too, is all the Minecraft clones.
9103016	9106579	Like, you look at the top games, like, half of them are Minecraft clones.
9106639	9107280	It's crazy.
9108821	9109041	Yeah.
9109061	9109141	Yeah.
9110491	9115134	Well, that's what I had called about and just wanted to call in and say hi.
9115754	9120297	Well, hello, and thank you for alerting us to a game we ought to be keeping our eyes on.
9121077	9123619	Yeah, I'll go ahead and post the link to their website in the chat.
9123919	9124259	Awesome.
9125220	9126641	All right, well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.
9126681	9127001	Take care.
9128742	9135966	Panaxium, everybody, on our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9139229	9140890	I'm looking up Link to the Past right now.
9142010	9143611	Oh wait, no, Link to the Past is the Super Nintendo one.
9143631	9144331	That would have been different.
9144351	9145772	What was the Adventures of Link?
9145792	9147753	What was the second game?
9149633	9150454	Of Link.
9150694	9152135	Live radio, boys and girls.
9152995	9153375	Here we go.
9153655	9155316	The Adventure of Link title.
9155856	9156096	Yeah.
9157997	9160518	Oh wow, even the little... That does... That sounds different too.
9160538	9164720	Yeah.
9171235	9174176	I always knew the Famicom games sounded different.
9174256	9180059	I knew about this chip and all that stuff, you know, just as, you know, keeping my finger on the gaming community pulse as long as I have been.
9180079	9180719	You knew about this stuff.
9180759	9183281	I never really sat down to the time to listen to some of this stuff.
9183721	9191204	That's awesome.
9191224	9192945	That's awesome.
9194025	9195046	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9195066	9195406	Who's this?
9196186	9197307	This is the one and only Ranma.
9197707	9199028	Hey, Ranma, what's up, buddy?
9200100	9206464	I just want you to know, for the first time in the history of calling this show, you guys have derailed me from what I wanted to talk about.
9207004	9207584	Uh-oh.
9207864	9208125	What?
9209245	9209865	Rush Jet 1.
9210186	9212147	After hearing that music, I went straight to the Googles.
9214368	9215389	It's pretty awesome, isn't it?
9216329	9219592	You have no idea, especially with the fact that I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
9219952	9221653	I'll be filling this up on my phone tonight.
9222314	9223414	He's good, too.
9223574	9224575	He's got a lot of stuff.
9224615	9229519	There's a track that I think we have in rotation on VOG, actually.
9230039	9235483	It was on the old Orange, because I went through the old Orange Lounge Radio files when we were putting together VOG's initial playlist.
9235503	9240167	And obviously we want a mixture of geek stuff as well as the video game stuff in there.
9240527	9245371	But we actually had, oh shit, now that I'm talking about it, of course I can't find it.
9245951	9272397	but we actually had in there a track it was called I think it was Kanamized was the name of the song I'm going to see if I can find it while we're talking here I'll play a little clip of it but it was awesome by the way Jason also suggested finding the Hyrule Castle Famicom version from Zelda 2 oh I've heard that one it is phenomenal that's pretty amazing I don't even like Zelda 2 that much but I love the music in it actually Zelda 2 is my favorite one because believe it or not that was the first Zelda game I ever played
9274353	9275934	The first one for me was the first one.
9276174	9278834	But I just didn't like the side-scrolling aspect.
9278874	9281455	I mean, I'm not going to whine because it was hard.
9281755	9283176	I mean, the game was really freaking hard.
9284116	9285536	But it was just the style.
9286156	9287177	It just didn't seem quite right.
9287197	9289297	And it also looked like Link was stabbing people with his cock.
9291398	9292458	The downward thrust.
9292518	9292958	Wow.
9294358	9294778	Come on.
9295959	9297759	I was in puberty.
9297839	9298599	I knew what those were.
9299980	9300420	Just saying.
9301368	9303431	So what else did you call in to talk about tonight?
9303471	9304653	Just Rush Jet?
9305695	9308138	No, I was out earlier so I mishapped the show.
9308219	9308900	I apologize.
9309721	9310442	Shame on you.
9310642	9311043	It's fine.
9312926	9313647	Two quick things.
9314288	9315630	Did you hear about what's happening to G4?
9317148	9318089	The Esquire thing?
9318129	9318409	Yeah.
9320150	9330816	You might have missed it when we were talking about it, but another podcast, The Nerdist with Chris Hardwick, Alan informed me that they were talking about that it's actually like Brovo is what the network's basically going to be.
9331116	9335539	And we were coming up with a joke, The Real Dude Bros of Orange County might be a show.
9336339	9338200	Sounds like Hipster Spike TV.
9341862	9342203	Yes.
9342323	9346105	What do you think the Esquire channel will end up being?
9347409	9348230	I don't know.
9348250	9350311	I don't think I want to know.
9350611	9353373	It would be funny nonetheless to see the end results.
9353613	9354614	Here's the other question.
9354714	9355474	Do you care?
9356635	9357276	No, not really.
9358176	9360338	Here's that song, by the way, that's in rotation on VOG.
9360378	9360798	I found it.
9370543	9370703	MagFest
9398547	9400608	I've heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is.
9401229	9404490	Is this about Mag the game on Sony or no?
9405291	9408272	No, it's a four-day gaming convention.
9408793	9409113	Okay.
9409973	9410874	All types of video games.
9411034	9412255	And I'm checking the guest list.
9412275	9413695	They have some interesting people here.
9414356	9419359	Let's just say there's somebody here where we may have to ship DarkSakura over to DC for it.
9419619	9420079	Uh-oh.
9420699	9421720	Who's going to pay for the ticket?
9424087	9424808	I have my ways.
9426370	9429154	Okay, what's the talent that's going to be there?
9429795	9432619	Well, a couple of names here we've heard on the show, like John St.
9432679	9434141	John and Eric Ruth Games.
9434642	9435964	Yes, I definitely know John St.
9436004	9436264	John.
9436284	9436604	Yep, yep.
9438098	9444840	And since you mentioned Castlevania earlier, Kinuyo Yamashita, composer for Castlevania.
9445961	9446161	Ooh.
9446761	9446981	Wow.
9447421	9447761	Nice.
9448682	9450462	And can I get a drumroll, please?
9453563	9454323	Yuzo Koshiro.
9454764	9457544	Nice.
9457805	9458085	Ooh.
9458165	9459905	I'm a huge Yuzo Koshiro fan.
9459925	9460725	That's awesome.
9461546	9463486	Well, we have one spot left in our room.
9464527	9464947	When is it?
9466124	9467205	We are in line for press.
9486824	9487124	Awesome.
9487244	9489565	SSJ100Matt says MagFest is amazing.
9489965	9491966	Brentalfloss has been there the last few years.
9492466	9495407	Yes, and they also call this con Drinkfest.
9495507	9497127	I don't think I have to explain why.
9498127	9499108	Can't imagine why.
9499128	9502869	There's a reason why they're walking around with styrofoam containers.
9503349	9505189	Hopefully I make it out there for PAX East.
9505209	9505830	We'll see.
9505870	9506530	I'm still trying.
9506870	9510671	I have to wait for them to open up the media registration to see if we can make that work.
9512147	9514708	My entire staff, we got our badges in advance.
9515209	9516530	Then we're going to apply for press.
9516590	9521113	And if we get pressed, then we'll just pass the badges on to somebody else or whoever.
9521933	9522354	There you go.
9522654	9523294	Paying it forward.
9524275	9525636	Got that shit right.
9526076	9526536	Alright, buddy.
9526556	9527797	I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.
9528558	9529078	Take care, man.
9529138	9529719	Alright, take care, buddy.
9529839	9530559	Have fun at MAGFest.
9531080	9531320	Will do.
9532952	9539054	Yeah, and I've basically been told that basically, yes, I am being forced at gunpoint to go to DragonCon next year.
9539134	9540355	So that's like a thing.
9540695	9544216	I've been told if you want to go to PAX, you better go to PAX East because you ain't going to PAX Prime.
9545677	9546017	All right.
9546417	9546798	Yes, sir.
9546818	9552840	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9552880	9559443	So yeah, if you're in the southeast part of the country, you might want to make plans on DragonCon because there's like a lot of VOG stuff going on at DragonCon next year.
9559603	9560463	That's all I can really say.
9563689	9570711	Orange Launch Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR Loki, I can go to you for last minute stories, but I can also do the Twitter topics.
9571031	9572412	I've got last minute stories if you want them.
9572452	9572972	Yeah, go for it.
9573592	9579314	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to the PlayStation Network probably next week.
9580294	9587716	It's dated for December 12th in Hong Kong, I believe.
9587756	9589177	It's the English version there.
9589597	9598065	However, it has been also confirmed on the Drop, which is the PlayStation Blog's little bit where they talk about stuff that's coming out.
9598646	9601909	And next week, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas PS2 Classic.
9602109	9605312	So, fantastic that that's going to be coming out.
9606974	9613579	Also, there's been some Linux system requirements popping up on Steam for some games that haven't really been announced yet.
9614020	9623567	Serious Sam BFE's Linux requirements have been on there, and also some more of the, I guess, a few Greenlight games as well.
9624088	9631073	So, perhaps more evidence that they're really working towards that Steam version, or the Linux version of Steam for the Steam box.
9631093	9631954	Right.
9632154	9632754	Be interesting.
9632814	9637676	And then finally, the next Assassin's Creed is going to be in Brazil.
9638416	9640097	And this has been actually confirmed.
9640157	9648480	I guess GameSpot says they verified the translation that the next chapter is supposed to be held in Brazil.
9648860	9651421	And this was coming from Ubisoft Brazil.
9653142	9653762	Imagine that.
9654002	9655943	Yes, that their next game is going to be there.
9656143	9660745	Obviously, it would be perfect for them to be working on it in some capacity.
9662776	9663817	That's it.
9663857	9664918	Going to some Twitter topics.
9664958	9665258	Oh, oh.
9665698	9665958	Sorry.
9666138	9667219	One last thing real quick.
9667399	9670622	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype.
9670782	9679668	As I mentioned on my Twitter this week, I am very disappointed to announce that Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable has been canceled in the U.S.
9680569	9707238	at least the retail release of it now that doesn't rule out that they could be doing a digital only version which would make sense because the Vita not doing so great and a game that's kind of niche like Earth Defense Force may not sell very well as far as releasing at retail DJ Max Technica just came out on Vita this week and it's apparently easier to get on the digital store than it is to get a physical copy yeah so that might be might be why
9708022	9709643	Let's go to the phones because you have a call coming in.
9709683	9710584	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9710604	9710944	Who's this?
9713946	9715367	Hey, this is Ragenator.
9715567	9716447	Hey, Ragenator.
9716528	9717628	And look, another video.
9717728	9721311	I like that the callers are actually listening to the request for more video.
9721671	9722291	What's up, buddy?
9724312	9724993	Not too much.
9725873	9730116	I just have a couple of questions for you.
9730536	9730817	Sure.
9731957	9735279	First off, I know that Rams...
9737312	9739393	are kind of a legal gray area.
9739913	9754197	But it turns out that emulators, assuming that you have, let's say, Final Fantasy XII for the PS2, you actually own the game, are you allowed to use an emulator to play the game?
9756161	9758944	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9772981	9777462	and you use an emulator to play that backup copy, I believe you're okay.
9778022	9783163	However, if you downloaded said copy from the internet, technically that's where you're in the legal gray area.
9783583	9787264	Are you going to end up on Judge Judy and spend time behind bars because of it?
9787644	9788984	Probably not.
9789305	9790285	Probably not.
9790705	9795426	But are you being 100% legal?
9795946	9798526	You're a law-abiding citizen by every step of the way?
9798887	9799947	Probably not.
9800267	9800527	But
9801327	9814131	I think ethically, if you want to ask kind of the ethical question, if you own the game, then yes, you ought to be able to have the emulator and do whatever crazy things you want to do with the hacking and so forth.
9814191	9818452	You paid your money to support the developers and get the game and so forth.
9818792	9819412	Have at you.
9819472	9820272	Do what you want with it.
9820453	9821893	I think ethically you're okay.
9822898	9829166	Yeah, I mean, you know, I brought it up because I still have a lot of games on desk.
9829186	9830207	I got laying around.
9830267	9833091	Luckily, the things back in August did not scale everything.
9834032	9837233	I still got my Final Fantasy XII and I've been dying to beat the game
9863840	9868383	Legally, yeah, but ethically, I think you're okay.
9868944	9884235	Yeah, I just kind of figured, you know, if there was something out there that, you know, programmed it, well, mimicked the hardware, I mean, if I actually popped the disc into my computer's DVD drive, the original disc, you know, basically turned my computer into a PS2, um,
9886781	9889202	I wasn't totally sure if it would be legal or not.
9889242	9891564	So I don't want to get myself into trouble.
9892264	9893124	I think you'll be fine.
9893164	9894265	Nobody listens to this show.
9894305	9894905	That's the good news.
9896446	9903110	On the PlayStation 2, didn't you have that hard drive backup thing where you could load all the games to the drive and play them off the drive and it worked fine?
9903430	9904390	Yeah, it was.
9905011	9905431	No, not you.
9905451	9905711	I'm sorry.
9905731	9907092	That was Loki, not you, Reginator.
9907112	9907292	Sorry.
9907552	9909434	Yeah, there was the HD loader that they had.
9909494	9910394	Yeah, the HD loader.
9910554	9913096	And, you know, if it's games you own, that's fine.
9913136	9919461	But if you're renting games, dumping them and then shipping them back, that's ethically shame, shame, slap on the wrist.
9919622	9919862	Yeah.
9919882	9921503	So, anyway, sorry, Reginator.
9922144	9931131	Yeah, well, I don't see, at least with what you were just talking about, you know, even then, how many games are going to put onto that PS2 hard drive?
9931251	9932852	It was only a 60 gigabyte hard drive, or
9937419	9938980	scratch that out, 40 gigabyte.
9939701	9946925	And the average, what, PS2 game was about, I'd say no more than 8 gigs.
9947385	9950667	That's where you hack things to get the 500 gig hard drive to work.
9952008	9953208	Which you can also do on the Wii.
9955710	9964175	Now, one thing I kind of touched on over the past month or two is that now that I don't have any consoles anymore,
9964988	9982372	any more, thanks to these, I've been getting into PC games, and at least temporarily I've been using games for Windows Live in the marketplace, because I have a pre-existing account through Microsoft when I have my 360.
9985053	9993235	And I noticed that compared to, say, Xbox Live in their marketplace, there's hardly any
9996695	10000208	for lack of better term, meaty games like, let's say, uh,
10001397	10009679	The Duels of Planes, Focker's Games, there's no Geometry Wars, no... That's why it failed, sir.
10009779	10012099	That's why it unfortunately has failed.
10012319	10021881	And unfortunately, what you see there is probably all that's going to be there because now it's all about the Windows 8 marketplace is where the future focus is going to be.
10022401	10026722	I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I think games for Windows is sadly a thing of the past.
10027022	10029824	Now, that being said, right now my computer has Windows 7 Home Premium installed.
10029844	10031045	Now, would you recommend, based on what you know about
10062922	10065264	I haven't used it, so it's hard for me to say.
10065404	10068748	I couldn't say, yes, you should upgrade, but I'm not using it myself.
10069248	10076376	I will tell you my hesitation is that I want to see how the compatibility looks with Windows 8 and kind of what the complaints are about it.
10076616	10078298	Also, if it's not broke, don't fix it.
10079179	10085726	Most of my friends that are using it, this is kind of the bottom line that I've heard from people that are using it right now.
10086226	10089290	If you're on something before 7, then upgrade.
10089870	10096758	But if you're on 7, there's a few little perks, but it's not something you gotta get right now.
10097258	10097679	It can wait.
10099881	10100121	All right.
10100241	10100762	Sounds good.
10101002	10101722	All right, RageNator.
10101903	10103584	I got to let you go so we can wrap things up.
10103744	10106326	But thank you so much for the call, and thank you for the video.
10107087	10107687	Sure, no problem.
10107747	10108568	All right, take care, buddy.
10109429	10109949	All right, bye-bye.
10110029	10110329	Bye.
10111290	10113032	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10114313	10116715	Thank you to all our callers for calling in.
10116755	10120798	Now that we have the router and that the stream's not dropping, I think we need to get a studio cam back.
10120838	10122239	I think that might be something we need to do.
10122719	10124421	That way we can look at the listeners when they're calling.
10125001	10131927	Alright, that is not going to do it just yet because I need to get to the Twitter topics, but that is going to do it for the Skype line.
10131967	10142094	If you didn't get through, email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Redertainment tweeted us earlier and said, OLR, the Grammys ended with an award.
10142635	10144236	The Emmys ended with an award.
10144556	10146258	The Oscars ended an award.
10146958	10150941	The VGAs ended with Tenacious D. What the fuck?
10152222	10153083	I'd say that's a good ending.
10154944	10156425	Unpopular opinion time.
10157445	10159346	I think Tenacious D is super overrated.
10159926	10160727	I don't think they're that good.
10162467	10163788	I caused Jamie to choke.
10163848	10164428	Yay.
10164808	10166249	No, the latke caused me to choke.
10166709	10167950	I know that's unpopular opinion.
10167990	10169010	I'll get hate mail.
10169331	10173032	For the record, when you reheat the latkes, do it on the stove.
10176074	10176674	Poor Jamie.
10176954	10177574	Do you give me all right?
10177594	10179135	Do you need water?
10179155	10181136	Okay.
10181196	10181436	Okay.
10183405	10187075	I don't need an ambulance to interrupt an episode of Orange Lounge Radio either.
10187155	10188238	We haven't had evacuation.
10188258	10190564	She's putting the hack in Hanukkah.
10195830	10198252	TigerClaw sent us a story lead here.
10198792	10203435	Bronies shut down their My Little Pony MMO, blaming copyright law.
10205357	10208179	You know what got shut down today, actually?
10208259	10208459	What?
10209300	10213963	Two of the largest indexers for Usenet.
10214303	10216084	People still use Usenet?
10216985	10219007	For any legitimate purpose whatsoever?
10219027	10219107	Yeah.
10219867	10221868	Yeah, yeah.
10222168	10223748	Hence why those sites are getting shut down.
10224369	10225449	It's legit.
10225589	10228410	I remember when Usenet was actually a chap for them.
10228430	10228650	It's legit.
10228770	10231711	I mean, there's totally not pirated stuff on there.
10232451	10238053	But yeah, NZB Matrix and Newsbin 2 got shut down.
10239813	10242075	All right, so back to the brony story.
10242496	10248922	Some brony developers were putting together My Little Pony Online, but a cease and desist came in from Hasbro.
10249483	10250684	But they pressed ahead.
10251124	10257050	They said, screw it, and they moved forward, and they released the game's first episode a month ago.
10257731	10263873	However, Hasbro's lawyers sent down a shutdown demand to HLP Online.
10264593	10270454	The team put out a statement, it's very carefully worded, not blaming Hasbro through the shutdown.
10270934	10274095	Quote, Hasbro is not to be blamed here, they wrote.
10274735	10276676	As per US trademark law...
10277256	10282057	As soon as an infringement comes to light, they are obligated to defend the trademark or they will lose it.
10282397	10287338	They had no choice in the matter, regardless of what they thought the project or how it benefited them.
10287758	10289858	There was little we could do to work around it.
10290158	10293159	Discussions continued through the month, but it came down to one fact.
10293679	10295900	MLP Online had to come to an end.
10296380	10298900	So it's that whole... You know, we've heard this a couple times this year.
10299000	10301021	I remember the whole gamer thing.
10301381	10302881	Remember when Reddit got sued or...
10303681	10311886	Not sued yet, but the cease and desist went to Reddit over the gamer thing, where gamer.org had it, and then they said that Reddit had to stop using it.
10311906	10317030	I don't know if that's really been resolved yet, but the guy was like, hey, I have a trademark, and I have to protect it.
10317430	10320852	And a lot of people are like, why were you given that trademark in the first place?
10321613	10327316	Now, this is a little different, because we can all understand why Hasbro has a trademark on My Little Pony, but...
10330098	10338805	Ranma in chat, I know one of our resident bronies, says, I'm surprised that Hasbro sent a CND due to all the episodes floating around on YouTube.
10340246	10343828	Well, if Hasbro gets the magic button, those will all disappear real fast.
10344029	10345690	And the people just talking about it.
10347771	10350974	Are there Watch Me Get High and Watch My Little Pony videos on YouTube?
10351294	10352535	Like, reaction videos?
10352635	10353596	I'm sure there are.
10355034	10355554	Geez.
10356996	10358497	Never choke on a latke, people.
10359117	10364742	Tiger Claw tweets us to an article about Time's List of the Year, Gadget of the Year.
10365122	10367043	The Wii U, second place.
10367784	10369485	First place for Gadget of the Year.
10370166	10371147	Loki, you're going to love this.
10371867	10372568	iPhone 5.
10373749	10375170	Time's Gadget of the Year.
10379071	10380453	Those are tweets from Tigerclaw.
10380914	10393010	Lastly, from SSJ100 Matt, people say LEGO City Undercover is like LEGO Grand Theft Auto, but someone made a LEGO version of the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer, and he links us to it.
10393030	10393550	Have you seen this?
10393570	10393931	I saw it, yeah.
10393951	10394512	What did you think?
10395272	10396473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10414921	10429369	same fucking HUD same like everything as Grand Theft Auto so I wouldn't be surprised at one time that that was the thing that Rockstar was working on with them but now it's you know Traveler Tales or whatever whoever's putting it I think it's Traveler Tales when is that coming out?
10429989	10434592	I don't think they have it it's supposed to be launch window so in the next three months could be anything
10435663	10440828	Fuck, I mean, seriously, was it Wii Fit U now is the first half of next year instead of Launch Window?
10441408	10443230	And the rest of this is all March.
10443290	10445952	I mean, that is right there.
10446272	10454180	That would have been probably the only like if I were to pick up a Wii U, that would be the game I'd probably get is that Lego City Undercover because it actually looks pretty awesome.
10454280	10459144	But that's really the only game that's been kind of impressive to me is just that one.
10463437	10464097	Sorry for the dead air.
10464117	10465258	I was just catching up on chat there.
10466379	10467499	That is actually going to do it.
10467519	10468620	That was it for Twitter topics.
10468720	10470360	You said you were done with last-minute stories, right?
10470921	10471561	I believe I am.
10471641	10475223	So that brings us to a close of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10475703	10477284	Sad.
10477504	10482286	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we close up shop tonight.
10482906	10484607	And my final thought, I'll start tonight.
10484647	10487529	My final thought is F you to jelly beans.
10487589	10488389	They're addicting too.
10489410	10490750	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10491951	10492371	Latkes.
10493351	10514097	and Loki, your final thought tonight check out the VOG Minecraft server if you haven't yet there's information in our forums on how to sign up basically just say hey I want to sign up put your username on there and I add you to the whitelist because now we have mob arena, it's kind of fun just to battle monsters and it's really fucking hard so
10514997	10515418	DarkSakura.com
10545817	10551419	They have some usable classes because we're still tweaking the classes because some of them don't make any sense or don't work right.
10553199	10558400	Once I'm done tweaking that and the waves and stuff like that because we had a problem at one time where it was just creepers spawning.
10558740	10567302	It was just tons of fucking creepers and literally you would see you'd be watching up top and they have different waves.
10567322	10572704	They have one called a swarm wave and all the creatures spawn one heart worth of health but it's a ton of them.
10572764	10573984	So all of a sudden we saw like
10574805	10576927	30 creepers just spawned.
10577348	10580952	It was like, holy shit, there's a huge wave of creepers chasing after me.
10581493	10582054	So it was kind of fun.
10585404	10588046	Blackwolf says we also need a Forza Horizon night.
10588106	10588766	I'll be down for that.
10588806	10594190	That's on my queue for game rental games, so I need to send Silent Hill back because I'm probably not going to play much more of it.
10594330	10597553	I need to use a game for my steering wheel.
10597833	10599034	That would be fun to mess around with.
10599054	10601236	You know what game I have sitting here waiting to play?
10601276	10604058	I didn't get around to it for this week, but for next week on the PS3.
10604158	10604238	XCOM.
10606520	10615128	I have from the rental guys waiting to play, so I'm excited to check that out.
10615288	10622715	I was spending Thanksgiving with Spike from Game Buoy, if any of you listen to that show, which if you don't, you should.
10622815	10624416	They're a fun duo there.
10624857	10629361	But Spike was showing me XCOM on PC, and I played like a round of it, and it was fun.
10630181	10630362	So...
10632386	10632826	My mouse died.
10653587	10654148	Oh, it sucks.
