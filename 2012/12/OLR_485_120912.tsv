7000	14000	Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, December 9th, 2012, the Wii U is set to get a Google App, Nintendo blocks mature content during the day in one region, and could Idolmaster finally see a localized release?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 485 of our show for this December 9th, 2012.
46000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and gaming lulls with my co-hosts. Say hello first up to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
57000	58000	Latke
58000	59000	How are you doing?
59000	60000	Latke
60000	61000	A lot of latkes
61000	64000	Yeah, we still have some left. I can make more.
64000	71000	Yum, yum, yum. DarkSakura was in the kitchen before the show tonight, and no, that's not a sexist joke. She was
71000	72000	I volunteered
72000	76000	Yes, she was cooking up some latkes for the holiday season, because it is Hanukkah.
76000	79000	Yup, it's the second night of Hanukkah.
79000	83000	Even though I am not Jewish myself, who am I to turn down food?
83000	86000	Right, and I give everybody Hanukkah presents.
86000	89000	And I say Mazel Tov! It was delicious.
89000	93000	I knew that Rob loves coffee, so I gave him and Allen a bunch of coffee.
93000	95000	Allen loves coffee too, that's important.
95000	100000	Well, I was like, what would they both like, so I got them crap tons of Keurig stuff.
100000	101000	Good times.
101000	105000	And I got, um, our other person in the room, um, gift cards.
105000	106000	Who I should introduce.
106000	107000	Including a Burger King gift card.
107000	109000	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
109000	110000	Yes, and thank you for that.
110000	111000	You're welcome.
111000	113000	I'm Jew by proxy, so.
113000	115000	Yeah, and I give everyone Hanukkah cards.
115000	116000	That's true.
116000	120000	You, you, okay, DarkSakura converted to Judaism, you know.
120000	121000	Yeah.
121000	126000	Uh, Loki married a Jew. Well, I don't, what's my connection? I have friends that are Jewish.
126000	128000	The last girl I ever knew was Jewish.
128000	129000	You know John.
129000	131000	There you go, John. I lived with John.
131000	133000	He's kind, he's not really Jewish.
133000	134000	I know he's not.
134000	136000	No, that's why I call him kind of Jewie.
136000	138000	You know.
138000	143000	I actually, and I really, I really do mean it, you know, I like all sorts of people that I've met in my life.
143000	144000	And you like their food.
144000	148000	I've met, like, I don't think I've ever met a Jewish person I didn't like really truly like.
148000	149000	Honestly, so.
149000	151000	Well, you know, we're also about to-
151000	154000	Now everybody's going to be like, oh, that's a challenge.
154000	156000	Let me introduce you to the worst person I know.
156000	157000	You know what?
157000	160000	We're now about two weeks away from the Alpacalypse.
160000	163000	Oh, yes. The whole Mayan calendar.
163000	168000	No, the Alpacalypse. When the wooly, long-necked creatures of the world will come and trample us all.
168000	169000	Is that a Weird Al song?
169000	170000	No.
170000	171000	Oh.
171000	172000	It should be.
172000	173000	Instead of-
173000	175000	I thought that was his album, was Alpacalypse.
175000	177000	Well, yeah, but no, it was Alpocalypse.
177000	183000	But no, there's a thing like where they're showing pictures of Alpacas and they're saying so many days to the Alpacalypse.
183000	186000	I've been laughing, so I want to have an Alpaca party.
187000	192000	You know, all I have to say is that how many times have they predicted the end of the world and it didn't happen?
192000	194000	So this is just one more to put in there.
194000	195000	I know.
195000	201000	When NASA has to come out and say, stop being depressed, the world is not going to end.
201000	203000	Your move next, world.
203000	209000	Anyhow, how are you, Techmaster Loki, in non-Armageddon news?
209000	210000	Good.
210000	216000	I've been constantly entering stuff on that steamgifts.com and obviously not winning anything.
216000	217000	Wait, what is this?
217000	220000	Steamgifts.com is basically a site you sign up for.
220000	222000	What happens is people give away steam codes on there.
222000	224000	So you enter raffles.
224000	229000	And so every time that someone puts a code up there, you get 5% of the points that that code's worth.
229000	234000	So each dollar, say it's a $5 code, it's, you know, 5 points.
234000	236000	You would get 1 point in your account.
236000	240000	So, like, I went in there earlier and I had 180-some.
240000	242000	And so I kept, you know, enter to win, enter to win all these things.
242000	245000	And then you come back a few days later, oh, he got more points.
245000	250000	And so you just keep entering stuff in there and you can, you know, put your own stuff up there if you want.
250000	255000	And then that'll give you contributing dollars in which you can go to certain ones they have locked out.
255000	261000	Okay, you have to have contributed $5 worth of steam codes to enter this drawing.
261000	264000	And it's a little easier to win because it's going to be more exclusive.
264000	265000	So you just do that.
265000	268000	But since it's free, I figured why not?
268000	272000	And you might win something, or in this case, not.
272000	275000	You might win spam, email, filling your box.
275000	282000	We always have the ever-present fourth guest on our show at the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
282000	290000	Because we do tape live, as we have for the past, coming up on 11 years every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
290000	293000	That's vognetwork.com.
293000	299000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, each and every single Sunday night.
299000	305000	And actdeft in our chat room tonight says steamgifts.com, where nobody ever wins anything.
305000	307000	Well, somebody does. It's just, it's very rare.
307000	309000	But better chances in the lottery.
309000	313000	Actdeft does follow that up with, I only won one game in like a thousand entries.
313000	315000	Well, that was, that was one game.
315000	317000	Still better odds in the lottery.
317000	319000	Better than Loki's done out of that, apparently.
319000	321000	Haven't aired a thousand times yet, but.
322000	323000	Rob, I want to promote something.
323000	324000	What? Sure.
324000	326000	I told you about it earlier. My new Tumblr.
328000	329000	Sure. Why not?
329000	332000	Just because I want, I want people to give me suggestions.
332000	335000	My Tumblr is massaffecting.tumblr.com.
335000	340000	And I'm doing this series called Lowell Effect, where I'm doing just all captions on Mass Effect screencaps.
340000	342000	And I want people to participate.
342000	345000	If you think of a good one, make it and send it to me, and I will post it.
345000	348000	Do you think maybe everybody's burned out on that by now?
348000	349000	No. No. No.
349000	350000	Cause you talk about it every week.
350000	352000	Cause that's the, that's what I'm getting on Twitter right now.
352000	353000	No.
353000	354000	Is I need to shut up about the series.
354000	355000	No.
355000	357000	Because I'm ruining it by talking about it so much.
357000	358000	No.
358000	359000	Why not?
359000	360000	No.
360000	361000	Garris.
362000	363000	All right.
363000	365000	Again, live.vognetwork.com.
366000	370000	Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth.
371000	374000	What I wanted to talk about tonight was the VGAs.
374000	376000	Which, of course, happened on Friday night.
376000	377000	And I don't think any of us watched.
377000	378000	Well, that's not true, Jamie.
378000	380000	You saw bits and pieces of it, it sounds like.
380000	382000	Yeah, I was, okay.
382000	384000	I saw this gifset go, I wasn't gonna watch it all.
384000	387000	And then I saw this gifset go up on my Tumblr feed.
387000	393000	That was all, like, broshep and femshep playing multiplayer with Garris.
393000	395000	And I was like, okay, that's funny.
395000	398000	And so I found that the whole VGAs were streamed.
398000	400000	So I went looking through the stream to try to find it.
400000	402000	And I ended up watching bits and pieces of it.
402000	404000	Like, the Halo 4 thing was pretty funny.
404000	408000	And then I found the Mass Effect thing and I stopped caring about everything else.
408000	411000	I did watch the Claptrap one. It was pretty funny.
411000	416000	It was the little blips for, you know, best character of the year.
416000	418000	The Claptrap one was funny, I must admit.
418000	419000	But, no.
420000	422000	Shepherd was robbed, both of them.
422000	426000	I'm not gonna try to talk about or evaluate a show I didn't watch.
426000	431000	But just listening to Bobby, because he is before us, you know, every night, every Sunday night at VOG Network.
431000	437000	He was kind of talking about that it did seem like this year there was more stuff about the games.
437000	443000	There was less of the skits and kind of the, I guess for lack of a better term, dick and fart jokes.
443000	445000	And it did seem to be a little more about the games.
445000	450000	And certainly it's interesting that Walking Dead won.
450000	454000	I mean, you know, I'm not saying anything bad about the game.
454000	456000	I haven't played it, so I know no good or bad.
456000	458000	But I know a lot of people really love it.
458000	465000	And it has nothing to do with the OMG Zombies part of it, but just I guess the storytelling in the game is so good.
465000	469000	And you had another game that was kind of similar in some ways, Journey.
469000	473000	Which is one of those kind of very difficult to explain to somebody why it's so good.
473000	476000	But it's that whole, like, emotional connection.
476000	481000	So it's like, and Journey probably won, what, the second most awards besides Walking Dead.
481000	485000	So Emotion really seemed to connect with the audience this year.
485000	488000	The big bro games, like, what would be the bro games?
488000	493000	Halo 4, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, to some extent even Mass Effect, Jamie.
493000	496000	None of those games really got the same type of recognition this year.
496000	498000	Best RPG, hello!
498000	503000	That could be somewhat of a, I mean, I don't know, what does it mean?
503000	506000	I mean, at the end of the day, what do the VGAs really mean anyway?
506000	514000	But I guess you could say it is some of the critics and respected people in the industry coming together to make this decision.
514000	521000	So, you know, it's a little more than one site because it's kind of a collective.
521000	528000	Does the choice of the awards this year and the way it's all presented mean that they're taking this more seriously?
528000	531000	Any thoughts? No?
531000	534000	I'm yelling at Dan in chat room. Dan is in chat.
534000	538000	I just think that they need to have Samuel Jackson hosted each year because he's pretty funny.
538000	539000	Well, they've been doing that.
539000	543000	Well, he's only hosted four times out of ten years, so, you know.
544000	546000	But it's like the last four years, hasn't it?
546000	548000	In the best four years.
548000	552000	I did like him replacing Cortana and yelling at the people. I'm like,
552000	555000	Cortana should have yelled at them. That was awesome.
555000	558000	And then I was like, oh, wait, Garrus.
558000	562000	Who ended up beating Jennifer Hale for the voice?
562000	564000	I don't know. I didn't care.
564000	567000	I know. It looked from, oh, somebody from Walking Dead.
567000	568000	Yeah.
568000	574000	Again, I can't evaluate a game I have not played, so I have nothing good nor bad, but I hear a lot of good things.
574000	576000	And I will play it before the end of the year.
576000	578000	Mark Meer wasn't nominated, was he?
578000	579000	He wasn't even nominated, no.
579000	581000	Yeah, because he wasn't all that great.
581000	582000	But...
583000	584000	Okay, I will...
584000	585000	He's fine.
585000	588000	You know what? He got better the more he did it.
588000	589000	Like practice.
589000	590000	But Jennifer Hale...
590000	593000	She was dead on from the start.
593000	597000	It's not even just femshep. I'm just talking about her as an actress and all the crap she's done.
597000	598000	She's great.
598000	602000	And her Carol Danvers makes me a little, you know, warm.
602000	604000	There you go. Thank you.
604000	606000	The chatters filling in the gap there.
606000	609000	It was Clementine from the Walking Dead, Melissa Hutchinson.
609000	610000	And I understand...
610000	611000	Yeah, she's not bad.
611000	612000	I don't even...
612000	617000	Again, I haven't played the game, but I recognize that name as one that people talk a lot about on Twitter.
617000	620000	So I can clearly see that, okay, you know.
621000	623000	And I say, you know what, Dark Sakura?
623000	625000	Let Clementine have her moment in the sun.
625000	627000	Mass Effect, they're on their third game.
628000	630000	And it's had its recognition in the past.
630000	631000	Let Clementine have her moment.
631000	633000	I do have to say that I love that...
633000	635000	And not just as a Garrus fangirl.
635000	639000	But I do like that Garrus was up there, you know, playing multiplayer with them during the little thing.
639000	640000	Oh, the little skit.
640000	642000	It was hilarious.
642000	643000	I was like, yeah.
644000	645000	So...
645000	646000	Alright.
646000	648000	If it had to be anybody, it must be Garrus.
649000	656000	And just so you know, the best human male voice was Damian Clark from Borderlands 2 or Handsome Jack.
656000	657000	That's awesome.
657000	659000	Yeah, that's the little bits and pieces I've heard.
659000	661000	Yeah, yeah.
663000	667000	Doesn't the male award seem to go to villains more often than heroes?
671000	673000	Oh my god, Mark Hamill, thank you.
673000	675000	Win the award for the Joker last year.
675000	677000	Mark Hamill's awesome.
677000	681000	But that was also the last time he's voicing the Joker ever.
681000	682000	Unless you give him more money.
682000	683000	I doubt it.
684000	689000	Well, you think about people having to do a voice like that that's so different from their regular voice.
689000	692000	It's gonna actually take a physical toll on someone.
692000	694000	They're gonna have to do another Arkham game at some point, though.
694000	698000	So it'll be interesting to see how they frame it, you know?
700000	701000	Alright.
701000	704000	Anything else on the VGAs anyone wishes to comment on?
705000	707000	You need to watch that clip, it was hilarious.
707000	708000	I'll take a look at some point.
708000	709000	Or Lands 2.
709000	713000	And if anybody wants to see it, it's on my tumblr, mass effecting dot tumblr dot com.
713000	714000	Plug, plug, cheap plug.
714000	718000	Well no, the reason is because Viacom blocked it on YouTube.
718000	721000	Gunstar in our chat room, who could that be?
721000	722000	That's Dan.
722000	725000	No doubt commenting on the awards I was just talking about says,
725000	729000	evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
731000	732000	Well put.
733000	738000	Although, my hubby is awesome because he said Garrus does sound like a boss though.
738000	743000	His voice actor is kind of a goofy looking guy and if you ever watched the episode of Buffy he was in,
743000	746000	his awesome voice does not suit his face.
746000	750000	It is kind of nice when your significant other will make a concession towards your fandom, isn't it?
750000	751000	Yes.
751000	753000	If he, you know.
753000	756000	Has Nelly ever made any concessions towards your fandoms, Loki?
756000	759000	No, we had a discussion today about like,
760000	763000	I'm like, so what exactly, you know, what do you think?
763000	765000	I'm like, I don't know, garbage.
765000	768000	It's like, my point exactly.
768000	772000	And then in the case of Alan and I, we really do like a lot of the same stuff.
772000	778000	I mean, he's way more into Half-Life than I am, but I don't like dislike it at all.
778000	782000	When I played it, it was, you know, the little bits I have played, I've enjoyed.
782000	788000	I just haven't sat down and played the whole thing, so we don't really have that same conflict.
788000	791000	I'm sure there's something, there's something I'm not thinking of.
791000	794000	He's, you know what, my Rocky Horror thing and my cult movie thing,
794000	798000	he's been a good sport about coming out to see those and support that, so.
798000	802000	It's always nice when your significant other will buy into fandoms and so forth.
802000	805000	Alright, I guess let's get into our gaming weeks
805000	809000	and the types of games we have been playing this week.
809000	810000	Raginator in chat says,
810000	815000	What are the odds of Mass Effect and Garrus winning every award if Dark Sakura hosted an award show?
815000	816000	Shut up, don't judge me.
816000	817000	Don't judge me.
817000	818000	This is why we don't host one.
818000	819000	Don't judge me.
819000	822000	We should do a fun year-end show again this year though, but anyway.
822000	824000	Mass Effect all the things.
824000	825000	No, no.
825000	826000	And pumpkin.
826000	831000	No. I don't even, will Mass Effect 3 win our game of the year? Question mark, question mark.
831000	833000	It may not. I still have some games I need to play.
833000	835000	Mass Effect all the things.
835000	840000	Alright, Dark Sakura, tell us about your gaming week as if I need to ask.
840000	842000	I played Mass Effect 3.
842000	844000	And Faerie Solitaire.
844000	846000	God, that game is awful. I love it.
846000	850000	But for the past three weeks in a row, you've talked about your Faerie Solitaire.
850000	853000	You keep saying it's awful, but it's clearly not.
853000	858000	It's stupidly addicting. It's like playing on, remember back in the day when Neopets was big?
858000	862000	Now that was awful.
862000	864000	Yeah, but you remember the stupid card games on Neopets?
864000	865000	Yeah.
865000	867000	And they were like kind of addicting?
867000	869000	Is Neopets still around? They have to be still around.
869000	871000	I'll check. I wonder if I still have my damn account.
871000	874000	Didn't they sell Neopets shit at Claire's for some time?
874000	875000	Yes, they did.
875000	878000	Oh my god. Did you ever walk into a Claire's just to buy Neopets stuff? Be honest.
878000	880000	Someone that we both know has.
883000	884000	Who hosts another show.
884000	886000	Oh, okay, okay. Interesting.
886000	887000	I'm a witness to this.
887000	890000	You know what? I can't judge. I can't judge.
890000	891000	I can judge.
891000	895000	People have bought World of Warcraft cards. I can't judge.
895000	897000	Someone bought a Mass Effect 2 deck of cards.
897000	899000	And, wow.
899000	900000	You?
900000	901000	Yes.
901000	903000	And, wow. Lo and behold, the Joker card was Joker.
903000	905000	Everybody has their thing.
907000	912000	No, I have not turned into a My Little Pony fan because there is nothing that is awesome as the old one.
912000	916000	The old one kicked ass. The new one is stupid.
917000	918000	Alright, so.
918000	919000	I'm judging you all.
919000	922000	Anything else for your week besides Mass Effect and Harry Solitaire?
922000	927000	I watched Dan play, I'm sorry, Sega Racing Classic.
927000	931000	And he put it in karaoke mode and started singing Let's Fry Sky High.
933000	938000	I saw the pictures on his Facebook, and maybe I shouldn't be talking about your husband's Facebook on my radio show, but oops.
939000	947000	Of somebody, either a friend of the family or somebody in your family, sitting in the little cart playing Daytona USA.
947000	948000	What was that all about?
948000	952000	Sega. That was Dan's cousin's daughter.
952000	955000	Okay. Well, I mean, you didn't have to tell me who. I'm just like, what was the whole?
955000	956000	It's Sophie. She's cute.
956000	958000	What was the whole occasion?
958000	959000	I don't know. I wasn't there.
959000	960000	Oh.
960000	961000	I was hanging with Becky that night.
961000	962000	I assumed you were. My bad.
962000	964000	I was out on a booze buying spree.
964000	968000	Lots of Bailey's and Hypnotic and Kahlua and Sake.
968000	971000	And then Becky dyed my hair, and then we made fun of people.
971000	972000	It looked like a nice setup.
972000	975000	Actually, Becky dyed my hair and played Mass Effect 2.
975000	978000	Which Xbox Mass Effect 2.
978000	981000	It is not that bad. Don't listen to her.
981000	982000	It's fine.
982000	984000	The film grain is awful.
984000	985000	That's the problem.
985000	993000	Yeah, but she turned it off and either, like, either her TV's contrast is up too high or the textures are just really bad.
993000	995000	Don't listen to her. It's fine.
997000	999000	All right, Loki.
999000	1000000	Girl.
1000000	1002000	Tell us about a different game.
1002000	1007000	I played Far Cry 3 this week. Actually, a little bit more in the campaign.
1007000	1009000	And it's fantastic.
1009000	1011000	I was hunting dingos last night.
1011000	1014000	There will be no baby eating in my watch.
1014000	1017000	And let's see. What else did I do?
1020000	1023000	I played a bit of Minecraft this week.
1023000	1028000	I've been working on getting the VoG network arena, the mob arena, done.
1028000	1030000	And it is working right now.
1030000	1032000	The classes are still kind of a work in progress.
1032000	1036000	I'm still balancing things because it's fucking hard, okay?
1036000	1041000	Even with just a few people, we've only managed to get to wave 20 out of 100.
1041000	1043000	And I had to scale down.
1043000	1045000	The first boss is a chicken.
1045000	1050000	It's actually a pretty retarded chicken because it fires fireballs.
1050000	1054000	But I'd say about 95% of the fireballs it actually fires hit itself.
1054000	1058000	And so if you just, like, stand back for a while, it'll eventually kill itself.
1058000	1061000	Which is kind of funny, but before it had way too much health.
1061000	1064000	Because you can set the health to different levels.
1064000	1067000	And I had it set to psycho health because it's a chicken, you know, whatever.
1067000	1069000	It doesn't have a lot of health.
1069000	1071000	I didn't realize, though, the way it calculates it.
1071000	1075000	It's like the minimum health is like 100 or something.
1075000	1079000	And then it's, you know, time plus, you know, what was it?
1079000	1084000	The number of players plus one times 40 for psychos.
1084000	1088000	So this thing had like 16,000 hearts of health.
1088000	1094000	So we were literally beating it with a stick for, I'd say, 20 minutes.
1094000	1096000	And it still wasn't dead.
1096000	1099000	And it was just like, okay, I think this is a little too powerful.
1099000	1101000	So I had to tweak all that stuff.
1101000	1103000	But we have a bunch of cool classes in there.
1103000	1106000	My friend wanted me to make a pimp class, so I made a pimp class.
1106000	1109000	So you have a pimp stick that you can beat things with.
1109000	1114000	You have your variety of hoes that you can use that have different abilities.
1114000	1116000	You know, because the game has hoes in it.
1116000	1119000	And what else?
1119000	1123000	There's a wolf master that you have wolves that attack things.
1123000	1126000	And I have a miner class.
1126000	1132000	And there's a class that's, you know, like a golem class that you can build iron golems with.
1132000	1137000	Although, no wait, I had that class, but then the iron golems did no damage to anything.
1137000	1139000	So I had to remove that.
1139000	1141000	Ninjas, you know, lots of fun stuff.
1141000	1143000	But it gets hard.
1143000	1147000	I mean, it's just, it's insanely hard.
1147000	1149000	But it's kind of fun.
1149000	1150000	So I'm still balancing that stuff.
1150000	1152000	Probably working on that a little bit this week.
1152000	1154000	But some good times, though, so far.
1154000	1158000	And hitstunninchat at live.vognetwork.com wants to know,
1158000	1160000	are we getting world edit back?
1160000	1163000	Yeah, sorry, I've been messing with the permissions stuff.
1163000	1166000	Yeah, you will have world edit back soon.
1166000	1168000	As soon as I fix that.
1168000	1173000	Because I took everything out to figure out why the mob arena wasn't working.
1173000	1177000	And in the process I kind of removed some of the permissions thing.
1177000	1180000	I may put it back in the permissions bucket the way I had it before.
1180000	1183000	Because B permissions is kind of weird.
1183000	1186000	So I'll eventually fix that again.
1186000	1188000	Alright.
1188000	1190000	And then Call of Duty.
1190000	1193000	Just Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2, a little bit of each.
1193000	1195000	Mostly Modern Warfare 3.
1195000	1199000	Because we were supposed to be getting copies to do LAN stuff with.
1199000	1201000	But those never came from Activision.
1201000	1203000	And at this point I don't think they are coming.
1203000	1206000	So I'm not buying copies for everybody.
1206000	1208000	So fuck that.
1208000	1211000	So I'll play it with my friend.
1211000	1215000	And I think that's all I've played this week.
1215000	1218000	Wait, no, there's one other thing.
1218000	1220000	What the hell did I play this week?
1220000	1222000	There's one other game I played.
1222000	1225000	Nah, it's probably not important.
1225000	1228000	My gaming week, as I've talked about before on the show.
1228000	1232000	I did pre-order the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation.
1232000	1234000	And it came...
1234000	1237000	Whatever. You'd buy it too if you...
1237000	1241000	Actually, no. With the reasons that... I'll let you finish.
1241000	1243000	Well, here's the thing.
1243000	1245000	I got the game and it's fine.
1245000	1249000	But it was a little... I'm doing my playthrough again.
1249000	1251000	I haven't done a complete playthrough of the Mass Effect series.
1251000	1253000	I know I've talked about the game a lot.
1253000	1255000	And it's because I really enjoy the multiplayer.
1255000	1257000	It's kind of what's been keeping me afloat.
1257000	1260000	This is the first time I've really sat down to replay the entire series.
1260000	1262000	So I'm doing it this time as Renegade.
1262000	1264000	It's the first time I did it at Paragon.
1264000	1267000	And already I'm just seeing such differences in the story.
1267000	1270000	But I'm playing through the first game.
1270000	1272000	I'm playing it on PlayStation.
1272000	1274000	And if you guys didn't know, this is the first time
1274000	1277000	the original Mass Effect has been on the PlayStation 3.
1278000	1281000	This is the first time. And what? The game's five years old.
1281000	1284000	Because Microsoft had an exclusive on it for however many years.
1284000	1286000	So they're just now bringing it out.
1286000	1290000	So with all this time to release it and get it right,
1290000	1292000	you'd think it would be bug-free.
1292000	1294000	But unfortunately that wasn't the case.
1294000	1298000	I've been running into quite a few bugs that are not fun.
1298000	1300000	Well, they're not game-breaking.
1300000	1303000	So I can't complain too much.
1303000	1307000	But characters facing the wrong way in dialogue scenes.
1307000	1310000	Just weird.
1310000	1312000	Complete parts skipping.
1312000	1314000	But when I load my game in place...
1314000	1316000	So they're facing the wrong direction?
1316000	1318000	I have to ask you a question!
1318000	1320000	Yeah, facing the complete wrong way.
1320000	1323000	I only had one thing ever like that happen on the PC version
1323000	1325000	for Mass Effect 3.
1325000	1327000	And that's when you're talking to Liara and Glyph is in the room.
1327000	1329000	And if Shepard looks at Glyph,
1329000	1331000	then she doesn't look back at Liara at all.
1331000	1333000	But that's only for that one conversation.
1333000	1336000	Now, Shane's been telling me though that he's been playing the trilogy
1336000	1339000	because they got it too and that he's fine.
1339000	1341000	They haven't seen any of the problems I've been complaining about.
1341000	1343000	So, I don't know.
1343000	1346000	Maybe it's because I was downloading the Ni No Kuni demo
1346000	1348000	in the background while I was playing Mass Effect.
1348000	1350000	So...
1350000	1352000	Which, by the way, I didn't get to that demo yet.
1352000	1355000	Sorry, don't ask me because I haven't played it yet.
1355000	1358000	But yeah, I played a little bit of that.
1358000	1362000	Besides the bugs, the game itself is still great,
1362000	1367000	but I would still say the best version is either going to be 360 or PC
1367000	1369000	depending on if you're a console or PC.
1369000	1372000	Actually, for the first game, the PC is the superior version.
1372000	1374000	It really is.
1374000	1376000	Because they made the hacking thing is much better
1376000	1379000	and just the Mako stuff is not as frustrating.
1379000	1381000	No, no, no. First game, all the Medi-Gel.
1381000	1384000	Not the Medi-Gel, the Omni-Gel all the time.
1384000	1386000	Or whatever that stuff was.
1386000	1388000	Let's see, other games I've been playing.
1388000	1392000	I got from my rental service, Silent Hill Book of Memories on the PSP.
1392000	1394000	So, I was checking that out a little bit.
1394000	1397000	I haven't really gotten much further than the original demo,
1397000	1400000	so I can't really say anything in addition to the demo I've already played.
1400000	1402000	So...
1402000	1405000	But I don't hate it.
1405000	1407000	But it isn't really Silent Hill either.
1407000	1410000	Somebody slapped Silent Hill on a dungeon crawler game.
1410000	1412000	That's what it is.
1412000	1414000	Oh, I was going to say, yeah. See, that was the thing.
1414000	1416000	I was like, oh, maybe I'll try this and stuff.
1416000	1419000	And then I looked at the back of the box and it had the screenshots.
1419000	1421000	I'm like, what is a top-down third-person game?
1421000	1423000	Nope.
1423000	1425000	I like Alan's comment.
1425000	1428000	Mass Effect 3 still has the exorcism neck bug, which is hilarious.
1428000	1430000	Trainer gets it a lot.
1430000	1432000	Yeah, it's like they're looking completely over their shoulder.
1432000	1434000	I get it the most with Javik.
1434000	1436000	Let me put it this way.
1436000	1439000	When I played the series on 360, I don't remember ever seeing a bug
1439000	1441000	until the Omega DLC.
1441000	1444000	Omega DLC was the first time I saw bugs in the 360 version.
1444000	1446000	So just put it out there.
1446000	1448000	Oh, by the way, just in case you're curious,
1448000	1452000	the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 1 is based off the 360 version,
1452000	1454000	not the PC version.
1454000	1456000	The hacking game is the whole button-pushing thing,
1456000	1465000	not the arrow through the circular lock thing that the PC has.
1465000	1467000	So...
1467000	1469000	Interesting.
1470000	1472000	We've talked enough about that game here on this program,
1472000	1474000	so I'm just putting it out there,
1474000	1476000	that I do have the trilogy on PlayStation,
1476000	1480000	and it's just called Being a Fan and Buying All the Things.
1480000	1481000	You know what?
1481000	1483000	What?
1483000	1486000	The problem is, okay, you know I started off playing it on 360
1486000	1489000	and it hurt my hand.
1489000	1493000	I'm not going to go get another version of a game I've already got on PC
1493000	1496000	when I love my PC version and I can make my Shepard blue.
1496000	1498000	Just saying.
1498000	1501000	I was curious about some of the differences,
1501000	1505000	and especially multiplayer on 3, I wanted to have on the PlayStation controller.
1505000	1506000	Research for the show, Rob.
1506000	1507000	Yes, research for the show.
1507000	1510000	And it's not like I'm going to get a free copy, so might as well.
1510000	1512000	Might as well.
1512000	1514000	All right, that's it for our gaming week.
1514000	1516000	So we'll get into gaming news after I mention housekeeping,
1516000	1519000	twitter.com slash o-l-r, and of course our Facebook,
1519000	1524000	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
1524000	1526000	And Dark Soccer's yelling from the kitchen,
1527000	1529000	I'll have to make another pector and break.
1529000	1530000	I grabbed one earlier.
1530000	1531000	They're so good.
1531000	1532000	They're not good for you.
1532000	1533000	Why do we keep eating them?
1533000	1534000	Potatoes and potassium.
1534000	1535000	Then Alan's going to get home and be like,
1535000	1537000	you spoiled dinner.
1537000	1540000	I'm going to make him a whole big thing of them, okay?
1540000	1542000	All right.
1542000	1544000	Let's get into some gaming news.
1544000	1545000	Loki.
1545000	1550000	All right, so there is another game that's receiving a nomination for Grammy.
1550000	1552000	That wonderful game would be Journey.
1552000	1555000	And the soundtrack of the game is, I guess,
1555000	1561000	nominated for best score soundtrack for visual media.
1561000	1566000	And I guess the nominees so far, Journey,
1566000	1568000	The Adventures of Tin Tin, The Artist,
1568000	1570000	Dark Knight Rises, and let's see,
1570000	1574000	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.
1574000	1576000	So that would be pretty cool if it won.
1576000	1581000	I mean, the soundtrack in the game was pretty awesome.
1581000	1586000	And you may remember, of course, Civ IV won that award, I guess,
1586000	1588000	was that last year?
1588000	1589000	Yeah, it was last year.
1589000	1592000	Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists.
1592000	1594000	That was an interesting scenario.
1594000	1596000	I mean, that song's great.
1596000	1597000	Love Baba Yetu.
1597000	1598000	I mean, who doesn't?
1598000	1602000	And that's not just my Civ IV fandom coming into play.
1602000	1603000	I really do love that song.
1603000	1606000	But that was a weird situation because even though, yes,
1606000	1608000	it was the song from the video game,
1608000	1611000	it wasn't until he put it on his album,
1611000	1613000	because he had that whole album that he did,
1613000	1617000	and then that was nominated for the award from the album.
1617000	1622000	So that's why Civ IV came out in, what, 2008, question mark?
1622000	1623000	No, earlier than that.
1623000	1626000	God, Civ IV was probably like 06 or 07.
1626000	1630000	10 was Civ IV, the console version, so I don't know.
1630000	1633000	Yeah, no, it was a ways before that.
1633000	1636000	I want to say Civ IV was what they were pimping at my first or second E3.
1636000	1640000	So it was a while ago that Civ IV came out.
1640000	1643000	And, yeah, so it took a little while.
1643000	1647000	And I'm not belittling that achievement by any means.
1647000	1650000	That's an amazing thing, the amazing piece of work by Christopher Ten,
1650000	1653000	and so happy that he got acknowledged for that.
1653000	1658000	But this is interesting because now this is music that was made for the game,
1658000	1661000	released on the game soundtrack,
1661000	1665000	an entire body of work dedicated to the game getting nominated for the Grammy.
1665000	1671000	And certainly that's, you know, it's like we dipped our toe in with Baba Yetu,
1671000	1674000	and now we're starting to put the whole foot in by nominating a game soundtrack.
1674000	1678000	And in reality, this is almost as good as it gets.
1678000	1682000	I mean, video game soundtrack songs are not going to really get nominated
1682000	1687000	for song of the year unless you have something on the caliber of the Titanic song,
1687000	1690000	was the only, like, the last soundtrack song I can think of that got nominated
1690000	1692000	for a song of the year Grammy.
1692000	1695000	So, I mean, we're long, long away from that.
1695000	1700000	But being up there with all those films, that's an awesome achievement.
1700000	1703000	So now the question, is he going to win?
1703000	1705000	I don't know.
1705000	1709000	I know. It's hard to say. We're not really in the music industry,
1709000	1715000	so certainly it's got to be getting him a little more exposure, though,
1715000	1716000	than the competition.
1716000	1719000	But at the same time, the artist won the Grammy, didn't it?
1719000	1722000	Or the artist, excuse me, the artist won the Oscar, didn't it?
1722000	1726000	So it's, you know.
1726000	1728000	I don't know.
1728000	1730000	I don't know if that really ties in.
1730000	1734000	Just because it won the Oscar doesn't mean, you know, I'm going to win for music.
1734000	1735000	That's very true. You never know what will happen.
1735000	1738000	It's a different body of voters, and you never know.
1738000	1741000	There might be some people like us that kind of look at it and go,
1741000	1744000	yeah, video games should be getting more recognition,
1744000	1747000	or there'll be people that react quite the opposite.
1747000	1750000	It just really depends on who's voting on those.
1750000	1755000	So, Black Wolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
1755000	1756000	it won't win.
1756000	1757000	It's flat out, it won't win.
1757000	1759000	But this is what we wanted.
1759000	1762000	I don't know if not winning is what we wanted,
1762000	1764000	but yes, I don't think that's what he's trying to say.
1764000	1768000	I think he's trying to say the acknowledgement next to the film scores
1768000	1769000	is what we wanted.
1769000	1773000	And yes, I think to some extent that is what we want.
1773000	1776000	Could they possibly have a separate category for game soundtracks someday?
1776000	1780000	Could they be getting confused with Journey the game and Journey the band?
1780000	1782000	Dude, I love Journey.
1782000	1785000	They should totally get nominated for best soundtrack score.
1785000	1787000	Probably not.
1787000	1792000	I don't think Journey's been nominated for a Grammy since 82.
1792000	1795000	That's why they need to score the next Tron movie.
1795000	1796000	All right.
1796000	1799000	All right, let's move on with some more news.
1799000	1801000	Don't stop light speeding.
1801000	1805000	This one's about a comment from Gabe Newell on living room PCs,
1805000	1807000	which I want to preface this story.
1807000	1811000	You were showing me before the show, Loki, this big screen mode in Steam,
1811000	1813000	which I got to be honest, I haven't played a lot with,
1813000	1814000	but you were showing it to me.
1814000	1819000	And in a nutshell, it does turn your Steam environment
1819000	1826000	into a Xbox-style UI that takes up your full monitor space.
1826000	1828000	It doesn't look like Windows anymore.
1828000	1829000	It looks nice, I think.
1829000	1833000	Yeah, I like the ability that it basically,
1833000	1837000	since it is catered towards using a joystick, which is fine,
1837000	1840000	that you can sort your games based on joystick support,
1840000	1843000	whether the games have it or not, which is kind of cool.
1843000	1845000	The thing I wish they would add,
1845000	1847000	and maybe this is something that they can add later on,
1847000	1850000	is those games that do not support joysticks,
1850000	1855000	maybe have it where you can have some sort of in-Steam client app
1855000	1859000	or something like that, where you can set up almost like an X-PAD-er type thing,
1859000	1862000	where you can assign keys to the joystick buttons,
1862000	1864000	and then that way you can have a profile for each thing.
1864000	1867000	Because a lot of these games, and actually it's funny,
1867000	1870000	because Arma 2 is one that supports the joystick,
1870000	1873000	and I thought that was one that didn't support the Xbox game pad.
1873000	1876000	I was like, huh, that already does, so sweet.
1876000	1880000	And it's not like a wireless keyboard to use as a controller
1880000	1882000	for a game console is unheard of.
1882000	1884000	I mean, Final Fantasy XI?
1884000	1887000	Yeah. But see, the thing is, as I was looking at it,
1887000	1889000	I'm like, you know, that would not be that...
1889000	1892000	It wouldn't be that weird to actually...
1892000	1894000	You know, this whole...
1894000	1896000	Everyone's kind of talking about Doom and Gloom
1896000	1898000	with the next console cycle and stuff.
1898000	1901000	Not that it's ever gonna happen, but if it went the way where,
1901000	1903000	oh, we're gonna lock all this stuff down,
1903000	1905000	you're not gonna be able to sell used games and stuff like that,
1905000	1907000	would playing on PC be that bad?
1907000	1909000	No, I don't think it would be that bad, actually.
1909000	1911000	If it's all going through Steam,
1911000	1913000	it seems very convenient for me.
1913000	1916000	And honestly, the vast majority of the games I have on Steam
1916000	1919000	I have not played yet.
1919000	1923000	And it just keeps adding to the list, but I keep getting things for it.
1923000	1926000	But I have quite a collection that it would be kind of cool to have
1926000	1930000	a gaming PC hooked up to my TV to play stuff like that.
1930000	1934000	Well, that is where Gabe Newell thinks things are going,
1934000	1937000	meaning that those types of living room PCs
1937000	1941000	are going to be big competition for the next-gen gaming cycle.
1941000	1945000	This is in an interview with Kotaku at the VGAs,
1945000	1948000	because, you know, Gary Newell was there.
1948000	1951000	Was that what she called him? Gary Newell? Something like that.
1951000	1954000	Kind of messed up. There's a clip somewhere,
1954000	1957000	one of the interviewees called him the wrong name.
1957000	1960000	You're Gabe from Penny Arcade, right?
1960000	1962000	Gabe Do-Well.
1962000	1963000	She apologized for it.
1963000	1964000	Cousin of Dudley Do-Right.
1964000	1965000	She apologized for it on Twitter.
1965000	1971000	And I gotta say, you know, live TV sucks sometimes, especially, you know.
1971000	1975000	It can be a lot of pressure, so I shouldn't give her too hard of a time,
1975000	1978000	but obviously she's going to get yelled at for that mistake.
1978000	1983000	But anyway, Gabe Newell doing his thing on the red carpet at the VGAs,
1983000	1987000	talking to Kotaku, talking about that the big picture interface
1987000	1990000	ended up being stronger than expected.
1990000	1993000	Next, they want Steam Linux out of beta.
1993000	1996000	They want big picture on that operating system.
1996000	2000000	This gives Valve flexibility in developing their own hardware.
2000000	2002000	That's true.
2002000	2009000	He says he expects companies to start selling PC packages for living rooms next year.
2009000	2012000	They already are. I mean, look at Alienware.
2012000	2015000	I mean, it's vastly expensive, but you-
2015000	2017000	Look at Ouya.
2017000	2021000	Ouya is a bare-ass bones type of living room PC.
2021000	2025000	But it's that same setup as you would see with big picture mode.
2025000	2027000	In fact, the interface looks kind of similar,
2027000	2029000	although I do like big picture a little bit.
2029000	2032000	But from what I've seen, we obviously don't know what the Ouya looks like,
2032000	2034000	although we're not that far away.
2034000	2039000	I mean, and that Ouya thing, man, is smaller than this box right here,
2039000	2042000	my four-pack of Red Bulls.
2042000	2044000	Gabe Newell said in the interview,
2044000	2048000	quote, I think in general that most customers and most developers
2048000	2052000	are going to find that the PC is a better environment for them
2052000	2055000	because they won't have to split the world into thinking about,
2055000	2057000	why are my friends in the living room,
2057000	2060000	why are my video sources in the living room different from everyone else?
2060000	2064000	So in a sense, we hopefully are going to unify those environments.
2064000	2067000	Hmm.
2067000	2070000	I don't know.
2070000	2073000	The unification thing is interesting.
2073000	2076000	I think in a way that's what the consoles kind of want to be,
2076000	2079000	that all-in-one device, and you do see that, like,
2079000	2084000	360 tries to talk to Windows Media and all that sharing.
2084000	2088000	And even the PlayStation 3, you can kind of stream things off your PC and so forth.
2088000	2093000	It's not exactly intuitive on either one how to do it.
2093000	2096000	I think if a lot of that was built a little more into the interfaces,
2096000	2098000	you'd see a lot more of that.
2098000	2103000	I think they make it too many clicks to get to a lot of that stuff within the consoles.
2103000	2105000	I think it's interesting.
2105000	2108000	I think it definitely lends something to the fact of,
2108000	2113000	if they sold a little gaming PC in a box that looked like a console,
2113000	2117000	hooked up to your TV like a console, ran like a console,
2117000	2119000	why would I need a console?
2119000	2121000	Price point, because I think console prices,
2121000	2125000	it's going to be hard to build a gaming PC for $400
2125000	2130000	that can run all of these games and look nice.
2130000	2133000	I mean, granted, you can build a $400 gaming PC,
2133000	2138000	but it's not going to run a lot of these games in higher ultra and stuff.
2138000	2141000	And if you're streaming to your TV via HDMI,
2141000	2144000	I mean, you're talking like a really large resolution,
2144000	2146000	I mean, 1080p.
2146000	2151000	So it's going to be a little hard to make them look that nice
2151000	2154000	and run on that big of a resolution.
2154000	2155000	That's the only thing.
2155000	2156000	That's why consoles kind of,
2156000	2160000	I mean, granted, a lot of the games get stripped down a bit,
2160000	2163000	but that's the thing with PCs and like hell,
2163000	2167000	I spent $1,700 on my PC a few years ago,
2167000	2169000	and it was just like this high-end thing.
2169000	2171000	It ran Crysis pretty awesome.
2171000	2173000	And then now it's just junk.
2173000	2178000	It's just like I can't even upgrade it without replacing everything.
2178000	2181000	There's nothing I can salvage from it except for the case,
2181000	2186000	maybe the heat sinks, but everything else is just, it's so old.
2186000	2190000	Well, I find the part where he talks about how Linux,
2190000	2193000	the steam on Linux has to get better
2193000	2197000	so that they can kind of develop a box that supports Linux and so forth.
2197000	2198000	That strikes me as interesting
2198000	2202000	because why do video game consoles usually work the way they do?
2202000	2204000	Because they're dedicated gaming consoles.
2204000	2209000	They don't have all this excess fat for all the other things that a PC does.
2209000	2212000	But the interesting thing about Linux is that, as I understand it,
2212000	2214000	part of the reason people are such fans of Linux
2214000	2216000	is that it's a lean operating system,
2216000	2219000	and it doesn't have all the fat that Windows has with it.
2219000	2221000	That's what I'm running on my netbook.
2221000	2223000	Would that be a fair statement about Linux?
2223000	2224000	I'd say so.
2224000	2228000	You've got the control that Windows lacks.
2228000	2232000	So they want to use a better operating system, essentially,
2232000	2238000	to do a dedicated thing, which makes sense,
2238000	2241000	but could it be as powerful as a dedicated gaming console?
2241000	2243000	I don't know. You make a good point.
2243000	2246000	Do you expect that a little set-top box is going to do this 1080p?
2246000	2247000	It probably won't.
2247000	2252000	Granted, a lot of the games on Steam, aside from the big console,
2252000	2256000	the big triple-A games, like the indie games,
2256000	2260000	a lot of the indie games don't require a lot of processing power,
2260000	2263000	I think, that you would need on some of these higher-end games.
2263000	2266000	But there are those higher-end games that they're also on Steam,
2266000	2268000	and a lot of those are the ones that support the controllers.
2268000	2270000	So it's going to be hard.
2270000	2272000	Granted, a lot of this stuff is going to come down in cost,
2272000	2274000	and you could probably build something a little bit cheaper,
2274000	2278000	but I think it's going to be difficult for them to come up with something
2278000	2281000	that you can fit in a box small enough.
2281000	2284000	I mean, because you also have to worry about heat and everything,
2284000	2287000	fitting it into a console-sized box.
2287000	2291000	It's going to be a lot of engineering to get it right.
2291000	2295000	Akuma JP in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
2295000	2298000	What's wrong with being a chubby?
2298000	2301000	There is nothing wrong with being a little fluffy.
2302000	2305000	You'll notice in that whole thing I just talked about,
2305000	2308000	I didn't say I was going to throw out my Windows PC.
2308000	2311000	No, I mean, there's still things that I'll want one of those for.
2311000	2313000	Well, I just want to take a quick look real quick.
2313000	2317000	The Alienware one, remember, they have their console thing?
2317000	2320000	I was just, you know, an idea.
2320000	2323000	So it's the X51 mini gaming desktop,
2323000	2327000	and the base price, because it's from Dell,
2327000	2331000	the base price you can pay for that is $699.
2331000	2334000	So $700 for this.
2334000	2338000	$699 U.S., $699 U.S.
2338000	2341000	And here's what you get for $699.
2341000	2347000	It's a Core i3, which, I mean, that's not going to run some high-end stuff there.
2347000	2352000	You get 6GB of RAM, you know, a 1TB hard drive,
2352000	2357000	Geforce 640 GT, which is a pretty good graphics card.
2357000	2360000	It's not the top, top, top of the line.
2360000	2364000	But, you know, the Core i3 is really going to hurt it, I think.
2366000	2371000	I don't know, it just seems quite expensive to build something with that form factor.
2371000	2373000	Obviously, you don't need to pay Alienware to do it.
2373000	2376000	You can build your own smaller PCs for probably a lot cheaper than that.
2376000	2380000	You know what computer I'm hooking up to my TV as soon as I can?
2380000	2384000	A Commodore 64. And I gotta say, tangent time,
2384000	2388000	to Alan's credit, he told me that he was trying to get me a Commodore 64 for Christmas,
2388000	2390000	but it's probably not going to come through.
2390000	2395000	Because he tried to do an eBay auction, and it's outside of his price range or whatever.
2395000	2399000	But I was like, damn, that would have been awesome!
2399000	2402000	Dude, you just need to go down to the Danaios or something like that.
2402000	2406000	I don't think I don't look every time I go to see if one's up there.
2406000	2408000	You have to make sure it works.
2408000	2411000	I actually do go by the thrift stores and keep an eye open, too.
2411000	2415000	Well, my parents supposedly still have our old one, and my dad's kept it all these years,
2415000	2418000	and it might still work, so I said I want them to find it.
2418000	2421000	I don't even know when I'm going to play on it, that's the thing.
2421000	2423000	I just fucking want one, okay?
2425000	2428000	There's plenty of Commodore 64 games I could play.
2429000	2432000	I'll play Donkey Kong the way I remember it.
2432000	2436000	I didn't go to the arcades or have Nintendo that age.
2436000	2439000	I played Donkey Kong on Commodore 64.
2439000	2440000	Cliquavision.
2440000	2441000	There you go.
2442000	2443000	There you go.
2445000	2449000	Gunstar in chat says, the Commodore 64, it's really neato.
2449000	2451000	What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?
2451000	2452000	Yeah, Weird Al.
2453000	2458000	I did tell him, and this is advice for anybody that might be looking for this retro-tastic machine,
2458000	2462000	don't forget that there's also the Commodore 64C, which is totally fine.
2462000	2466000	It's smaller and has white keys.
2466000	2470000	It's like PS Mini and PS2 or whatever.
2470000	2471000	Same type of thing.
2472000	2475000	And then there was the Commodore 128, which had 64 mode.
2477000	2479000	128s are totally fine.
2479000	2480000	Just throwing it out there.
2480000	2483000	Everybody get robbed of a Commodore 64.
2483000	2486000	Gunstar reminds us the C64 version of Donkey Kong was rad.
2486000	2490000	It was because it had the Pie Factory level.
2490000	2491000	Yes.
2491000	2494000	Which is really supposed to be a cement factory or something, but it's pies.
2494000	2495000	It was the Pie Factory.
2495000	2496000	I know what you mean.
2496000	2501000	But I will say that looks-wise, the Cliquavision version was really good.
2501000	2503000	For a Cliquavision.
2503000	2506000	Hey, the Cliquavision of Mouse Trap was the best one ever.
2506000	2507000	Alright, moving on.
2507000	2508000	Dark Sakura.
2508000	2509000	More news.
2509000	2510000	Ugh, Rob.
2510000	2511000	Less Cliquavision.
2511000	2512000	Something more current.
2512000	2514000	How about Nintendo being butthead?
2514000	2519000	So, you know what you can't do, at least according to Nintendo of Europe?
2519000	2522000	You cannot access 18 related content at certain times of the day.
2522000	2524000	In fact, you get a little message that says,
2524000	2525000	You can't do this.
2525000	2526000	Meh.
2526000	2533000	It actually, one of the NeoGaf users actually had the issue and contacted
2533000	2537000	Nintendo of Italy's customer support and got this message.
2537000	2542000	Dear customer, we would like to let you know that Nintendo has always aimed
2542000	2545000	to offer gameplay experiences suited to all age groups.
2545000	2548000	Observing carefully the relevant regulations regarding content
2548000	2551000	access that are present in the various European countries.
2551000	2555000	We have thus decided to restrict the access to content which is unsuitable
2555000	2560000	to minors, Peggy, to the 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. time window.
2560000	2563000	I feel like in that same voice you should be saying,
2563000	2565000	For English, press one.
2565000	2571000	Para español, marque numero dos.
2571000	2574000	That was your very polite little operator noise there.
2575000	2578000	Except this is like Nintendo of Europe, so maybe I should have affected
2578000	2580000	a really bad British accent.
2580000	2582000	Dear customer, we would like to thank you that...
2582000	2584000	No. Sorry.
2584000	2588000	Now that makes me think of that South Park episode with the Worcestershire sauce.
2588000	2591000	You know when I called it water shower sauce?
2593000	2597000	So, it's like, you've got to be up all night to download anything.
2597000	2598000	Meh.
2598000	2600000	It's like, ugh, whatever Nintendo.
2600000	2602000	I don't know if they've done this crap here though.
2602000	2603000	Have they?
2603000	2604000	No. Yeah.
2604000	2607000	So, I guess Nintendo really doesn't like Europe.
2607000	2610000	Unless they want to give them RPGs that we want.
2610000	2613000	I don't think it's because Nintendo doesn't like Europe, Jamie.
2613000	2615000	I think it's some type of...
2615000	2617000	They don't like Italy.
2617000	2621000	My gut would say it's a law thing, but I'm like, I don't think there is a law.
2621000	2623000	Is it a culture thing?
2623000	2626000	It's a cover your ass type of thing, which is all Nintendo ever does.
2626000	2629000	You know, and I think they would have tried to do it here too,
2629000	2632000	except I think Reggie probably put his foot down or shoved up someone's ass
2632000	2633000	and said no.
2634000	2640000	It's weird because I want to come out and say this isn't bad.
2640000	2641000	Hold on, I'm doing a search.
2641000	2644000	But it is bad because I should be able to get what I want.
2644000	2649000	It's not bad if it only comes on when you have parental controls on.
2649000	2651000	Then that's a great idea.
2651000	2654000	This would be a great idea for parental controls.
2654000	2659000	Although, honestly, why would you want your kids using the shop unattended anyway?
2659000	2666000	Well, they can let kids drink wine, but they can't see boobs or blood.
2666000	2668000	But you don't have boobs in video game.
2668000	2671000	In fact, in Europe's culture, boobs are a little less...
2671000	2673000	Yeah, because America is freaking backwards.
2673000	2674000	Well, exactly.
2674000	2678000	So violence is much more of a thing over there.
2678000	2683000	So maybe that's the difference because we're so desensitized
2683000	2686000	through a lot of the movies like Saw and all that shit,
2687000	2689000	which is taboo over there.
2689000	2690000	Maybe that's the difference.
2690000	2692000	You know what? I think everyone needs to get over it.
2694000	2695000	Well, here's my thing.
2695000	2699000	I wonder if this was kind of a shock for the third parties that are involved in this
2699000	2704000	because if you think about it, why am I going to put my game on your marketplace
2704000	2708000	if you're going to limit the sale to only four hours out of a 24-hour day?
2708000	2710000	Brilliant question.
2710000	2711000	SSJ 100, Matt.
2711000	2712000	In all reality, yes.
2712000	2715000	I would love to know what the third parties have to say about it.
2715000	2718000	Who, by the way, sent me a Hanukkah card. SSJ 100, Matt.
2718000	2719000	My first one of the year.
2719000	2720000	Oh, go ahead. Sorry.
2720000	2723000	I was going to say, he actually says parental controls are hard for parents,
2723000	2724000	especially stupid ones.
2726000	2728000	But, I mean, they shouldn't...
2728000	2729000	They have this stuff in place.
2729000	2731000	They don't need to do this time thing as well.
2731000	2733000	And that doesn't stop anybody.
2733000	2736000	That's about as effective as an age gate, okay?
2736000	2738000	On a video. That's all it is.
2738000	2740000	Oh, I can't...
2740000	2744000	You know, a person that knows about Assassin's Creed 3...
2744000	2746000	First off, you'd have to be...
2746000	2748000	No offense, but I think you're going to have to be a complete idiot
2748000	2753000	to go download this game to your console instead of going to buy it retail.
2753000	2757000	I don't know why you'd do that unless, I guess, you're under the age or something like that.
2757000	2759000	And your parents really don't want to buy it for you.
2759000	2762000	Although, in which case, I say go to eBay.
2762000	2767000	So, I don't understand why you would want to download it to your console in the first place.
2767000	2769000	And then, on top of that...
2769000	2771000	I mean, fuck.
2771000	2773000	This person that knows about, you know, these games
2773000	2778000	is probably most likely going to be able to read most of the blogs out there on the internet
2778000	2782000	and go, hey, well, all I do is download this at 11 p.m.
2782000	2784000	And they download it at 11 p.m.
2784000	2789000	Kids shouldn't be using this parent's credit card on the store at any hour of the day.
2789000	2790000	And you know whose problem that is?
2790000	2792000	Their parents.
2792000	2794000	And that's whose problem it should always be.
2794000	2795000	Their parents.
2795000	2797000	I mean, here's the thing. They may not be using their card.
2797000	2803000	They may be buying, you know, a prepaid card at a store, you know, and putting it in that way.
2803000	2804000	All right.
2804000	2806000	So, there's ways around everything.
2806000	2808000	But once again, there's ways around everything.
2808000	2809000	So, why limit it?
2809000	2814000	Okay, and I know the comment about parental controls being hard earlier was said in jest or a joke or whatever.
2814000	2821000	But seriously, when you first turn on the Wii U, the first time you're going through the initial setup,
2821000	2822000	there is a question.
2822000	2826000	Do you wish to enable parental controls? Yes or no?
2826000	2833000	So, all the parent has to do is be there when their $400 machine is turned on for the first time.
2833000	2838000	And I'm pretty sure if this is like any other Nintendo console or device that comes with it.
2838000	2839000	$300, excuse me.
2839000	2846000	Like, four, like, thick fucking manuals that probably tell you how to set up, you know, parental controls if you really wanted to.
2846000	2852000	And if your kids aren't getting some sort of prepaid card, where the fuck are they getting the money to buy this?
2852000	2857000	Let's just say it's maybe like, I don't know, it's just stupid.
2857000	2867000	It's basically saying, oh, well, you know, we made this hardcore console that's really only available for, you know, children is what we've marketed this console to.
2867000	2870000	I mean, they're like, oh, yeah, we want this console for the grownups.
2870000	2872000	This is going to have hardcore games.
2872000	2875000	Oh, but sorry, you're not going to be able to play those hardcore games because this console is really just for children.
2876000	2881000	Breakman in our chat says censorship is a fucking bitch-ass whore slut.
2881000	2882000	You know what it is?
2882000	2883000	Correct.
2883000	2891000	It's just that these violent game trailers and games on the internet are very disturbing to elderly people who, thankfully, do not stay up past 11.
2891000	2892000	Although...
2892000	2894000	If they all just magically fall asleep right before 11.
2894000	2898000	Although, that's why, that's why, though, that it only goes till 3.
2898000	2904000	Because a lot of them do wake up quite early in the morning, so it's that 11 to 3 period that most elderly people are asleep.
2904000	2906000	That's why they're hiding this.
2906000	2907000	It's not because of the kids.
2907000	2908000	It's the elderly people.
2908000	2913000	VX JasonXV in chat wants to throw out a theory, and it's a good one, so let me throw it out there.
2913000	2916000	Nintendo is classified as a media service.
2916000	2918000	TV.
2918000	2920000	And now they have TV with VII.
2920000	2921000	TV.
2921000	2928000	And now they have to abide by TV laws, which restricts content into those hours in some countries.
2928000	2930000	Not a bad thought.
2931000	2934000	Is this because Nintendo is not treating itself as a game device anymore?
2934000	2936000	Because remember, they make their own fucking rules.
2936000	2939000	It's not an X-Gen system, it's a Nintendo-Gen system.
2939000	2942000	And this is now a television.
2942000	2946000	I don't think so, because look at the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
2946000	2953000	I'd say they have as many, if not more, streaming content on there than Nintendo.
2953000	2958000	It's just, why would you restrict the rules, you know, to one console and not the others?
2958000	2962000	I just, I think this is just something Nintendo is doing on their own.
2962000	2967000	I don't think this is anything that they're forcing them to do, because why aren't they forcing the other guys to do the same thing?
2970000	2972000	It's the Nintendo ass hattery, it's what they do.
2974000	2984000	I don't know if it's ass hattery, but it's very throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which we've seen Nintendo do so many times before, like friend codes.
2984000	2990000	Friend codes was set up to protect, you know, kids, and we all had to suffer for it.
2990000	2995000	It's the same dumb decision that screwed that up that's screwing this up.
2995000	2997000	Thank God it didn't happen here.
2998000	3005000	Although at the same time, do you really need to download ZombiU online, like just go to the store and buy it or get it on Amazon?
3006000	3011000	Seriously, just wait, or yeah, I mean Amazon, there's a perfect way, I mean you can do that.
3011000	3019000	A lot of, I just, I don't know, I don't think, what would be the point of downloading this stuff to your console?
3019000	3026000	I just, I don't know, for that type of stuff, unless you're like, you know, Steam, I understand, because a lot of times I buy stuff on sale,
3026000	3033000	and so, okay, that makes sense, I want to download this, and it's only available digitally, because a lot of PC games aren't available at the market.
3034000	3042000	But, a console game, I just don't see why I would need to, unless I'm getting some really great discount on it, why I would...
3042000	3047000	I'll throw this out there, for what it's worth, you don't have to pay tax on them right now.
3047000	3053000	I mean, technically you do, you have to report that to the state and your taxes at the end of the year, but let's be real, who's doing that?
3054000	3056000	So, you get them tax free.
3057000	3059000	That's not that much of a savings.
3060000	3067000	And you get the 10% kickback from Nintendo if you have a Wii Deluxe, or Wii U Deluxe, which most people probably do, that have the Wii U right now.
3068000	3071000	I just, I don't think that would be much of a motivator for me.
3072000	3075000	Just saying, that is something.
3077000	3081000	And you get it right now, well, an hour from now when it finishes downloading.
3082000	3083000	I'm probably more than that.
3083000	3084000	Faster than Amazon.
3086000	3088000	Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.
3088000	3097000	Alright, so the Wii U has sold 425,000 units in the U.S. after being out there for a week.
3099000	3104000	So, compare that to some of the other systems, I believe, the Xbox 360 and PS3, and the original...
3104000	3109000	Well, the original Wii, I want to say, sold only 300,000 units during that same time period.
3111000	3114000	The original Wii, I think they say in that same article, is 475.
3114000	3115000	475?
3116000	3122000	Well, yeah, it sold 475 in its first week, but I'm talking about actually now.
3123000	3129000	Like, I think it sold only, I think it was 300,000 units or something like that.
3129000	3130000	It was still pretty high.
3131000	3139000	And of course, the Xbox 360, I think it was three quarters of a million, and I want to say the PS3 was like five or something like that.
3142000	3143000	So, I guess that's pretty good.
3143000	3144000	Here's my thing, though.
3144000	3147000	And this is unlike, you know, the Wii.
3147000	3151000	So, you remember with the Wii, the whole reason was shortages on this stuff.
3151000	3156000	Last I checked, I went to the store, like, I went to Walmart one day, and I was like,
3156000	3159000	you know what, I'm just gonna go walk down Electronics Island, see what they've got as far,
3159000	3163000	let's see if they have any Wii U's, just see if they've finally gotten stock.
3163000	3165000	And there was a stack of ten Wii U's.
3165000	3169000	No, it wasn't like, oh, people are clamoring to get this stuff.
3169000	3171000	It was just sitting there, no one gave a shit.
3171000	3177000	And same with, like, you go on, like, GameStop, and you can do a search of their inventories and stuff like that.
3177000	3184000	And I'd say about the majority, well, all of them had some stock on them, and some of them had quite a bit of stock on them.
3184000	3193000	So, I know that they were doing more to replenish them, but I'm thinking that the demand on this isn't as high as they had hoped.
3193000	3202000	I mean, yeah, $425,000 sounds awesome, but is that gonna dip off really fast, because they're just sitting there now?
3202000	3207000	I don't know. I don't know. I think it's still too soon to tell.
3207000	3215000	I think we need to see what the entire holiday season looks like, and we need to see what the Fury looks like after the holidays.
3215000	3219000	Like, was it just a holiday thing, or is it still in demand in January and February?
3220000	3223000	But you know what it's gonna take to keep that demand going? Games!
3223000	3227000	And we've got... Pikmin?
3227000	3229000	In March.
3229000	3233000	Wii U games? Let me refresh my memory right here.
3233000	3236000	Wii U games, we've got, um...
3236000	3239000	30 Great Games? What's that game with the bear?
3239000	3245000	Family Party, 30 Great Games, Arcade, or Obstacle Arcade.
3245000	3250000	Tell me you've seen the Miiverse stuff for the 30 Great Games stuff.
3250000	3260000	Oh my god. Miiverse is becoming more and more like one of the most genius things to happen in gaming ever.
3260000	3265000	And I'm not giving Nintendo all that credit. It's an idiot savant type of genius.
3265000	3268000	It's unintended genius.
3268000	3272000	Where, like, Miiverse is amazing.
3272000	3277000	Have you seen the stuff on Miiverse for some of these, like, shovelware games that show up?
3277000	3279000	Alright, I gotta get the Wii U. You've gotta see this.
3279000	3284000	Loki, you'll laugh your ass off at some of the stuff that people are posting in Miiverse on these games.
3284000	3285000	But anyway.
3285000	3290000	But I was gonna see, like, right now I'm looking just to see what's in this area.
3290000	3293000	You know, as far as, like, availability.
3293000	3299000	And let's see here. The first one, low stock, in stock, in stock, in stock, low stock, in stock, in stock, in stock.
3299000	3303000	And that's the, you know, first eight stores that they have there.
3303000	3307000	In stock, in stock, in stock, low stock, in stock, low stock, low stock.
3307000	3314000	So, it looks like, you know, within, you know, 20 miles of us, they are stocked at every single GameStop.
3314000	3320000	And I think that's the same thing, you know, happening at, you know, Walmarts, Targets, probably everywhere.
3320000	3326000	So, that begs the question, I mean, I understand this may be a hot holiday item.
3326000	3335000	But, I don't think it's as, I don't think it's as in demand as they want it, they want everyone to believe it is.
3335000	3340000	And don't get me wrong, they have some pretty good games at launch, but they don't really have anything coming out.
3340000	3343000	Like, the first Wii U game I can think of is in March.
3343000	3353000	Rayman Legends is the, not March, February 26th is Rayman Legends, is the first big game to come out next.
3353000	3363000	Cool, that's like a whole month and a half, almost two and a half months of nothing for the Wii U.
3363000	3371000	I mean, that's kind of bad. That's not a good, you know, that's quite a drought of games.
3372000	3376000	Okay, I'm going to give this to you while I read the next story. I'm just going to give this to you.
3376000	3382000	Just scroll through and look at some of the posts on this game. Use the joystick on the left.
3382000	3386000	You can just scroll going up and down, because there's some funny shit on there.
3386000	3395000	Alright, moving on to the next story, which is about other things coming to the Wii U that I could hand the tablet to Loki during the show and have him take a look at.
3395000	3399000	Wii U Panorama View is coming in the spring.
3399000	3408000	This is something that will let you view panoramic videos on your gamepad by actually moving the device around so you don't necessarily use the joysticks to spin around.
3408000	3413000	You can actually pick up the device and move it around like one of those early Wii U demos.
3413000	3418000	That will be in the spring for both North America and Europe. That will be an eShop release.
3418000	3426000	There is a free preview demo that will be going on the eShop that will have some scenes that will come in advance of the actual release.
3426000	3436000	Now, I have no idea how these pictures are taken or where they come from. I'm assuming there's a particular format standard out there, because I know I've seen panoramic pictures online before.
3436000	3443000	Interesting. I don't know if it's particularly useful, but okay. Google Maps.
3443000	3444000	What's on his head?
3444000	3446000	Oh, that was from Nintendo Direct.
3446000	3452000	So basically it's just your average forum with all sorts of memes in here.
3452000	3462000	But that is Nintendo moderated and endorsed on the console. If you press pause and hit Miiverse, that is what you'll see.
3462000	3469000	Yeah, that's cool that they're only removing offensive stuff, but not a lot of memes are offensive.
3469000	3473000	Do you see a lot of the stuff with the jokes about shovels?
3473000	3483000	Yeah, I understand the Nintendo seal of crap. I understand that, but I hardly call this genius. I just call this your standard forum.
3483000	3485000	Are you not entertained?
3485000	3494000	No, I'm not entertained. I mean, I just don't know.
3494000	3496000	This is just in everybody. Loki is not amused.
3496000	3512000	I mean, they have Barry Potter and Batman that says, I have no family. I don't know. I don't think this is that great.
3512000	3516000	Maybe it was better the first couple days. Some of it's wearing off.
3516000	3518000	Alright, look. Moving on.
3518000	3522000	It's kind of funny, I guess.
3523000	3531000	Anyhow, PanoramaView was originally unveiled at E3, but they announced that it is coming in the spring, obviously.
3531000	3541000	Also coming, Google Maps for Wii U. The Street View functionality with Google Maps will work with the gamepad just like PanoramaView.
3541000	3547000	Because those Google cars take the panorama screenshots all the time.
3547000	3553000	That app will be in the eShop in late January. It will be free until the end of March.
3553000	3556000	Google Maps will be coming to the U.S. eShop in the first quarter.
3556000	3561000	So notice how it's not going to be forever that that thing is going to be free.
3561000	3566000	But I think that's kind of cool that Google Maps is coming. I mean, I don't know the particular usefulness of it.
3566000	3570000	I better buy a Wii U so I can get Google Maps.
3570000	3573000	What's with the flying penis rocket ship?
3574000	3581000	That's Miiverse. Somebody tried to get away with drawing a penis on Miiverse and they drew it as a rocket ship.
3581000	3583000	Hey, this isn't uncomfortable.
3583000	3587000	Yeah, I thought you played with the Wii U thing before.
3587000	3592000	Not with your little thing here. I'm not going to say anything about your little thing.
3596000	3602000	Let's move on. Dark Soccer, it's actually your turn. You'll have to put the tablet down for a minute.
3602000	3605000	Take your evil away from me, Rob.
3605000	3610000	So, next, people have been going off about this.
3610000	3618000	And, you know what? I was going to be super skeptical of it until I actually did look at the logo.
3618000	3628000	Needless to say, I'm talking about the Phantom Pain, which basically is a trailer of a guy that they had at the VGAs.
3628000	3636000	The guy has a hook arm and he's like, you're just waking up, and then a hundred feet soldier. We're getting killed out here.
3636000	3647000	And if you look at the guy walking around, he's got a gray mullet and a shaggy beard when you can sort of see his face, but most of his face is covered up in bandages.
3647000	3655000	And he's missing a hand, he's got a hook arm, and it's being put out by this Moby Dick Studios.
3655000	3661000	Which, I mean, I can't really think of anything how Moby Dick itself, you know, could be an illusion towards it.
3661000	3667000	Because, I mean, it's just a big revenge story, so maybe there's some revenge subplot? I don't know.
3667000	3679000	But the company is supposed to be some Swedish company, and the CEO is Joakim Mogren, but the J-O-A-K-I-M is an anagram for Kojima.
3679000	3683000	People are thinking this is actually a trailer for Metal Gear Solid 5.
3683000	3692000	Now, as I posted much earlier in the chat room, is that if you look at the logo, there are little chunks missing out of the text.
3692000	3707000	And if you use the same typeface and align it to these little markings that are coming out of the text, it perfectly fits the shape of Metal Gear Solid 5.
3707000	3712000	And I will relink the photo in the chat room for those who are curious.
3712000	3721000	But, I mean, and I mean, I'm even looking, it has to be, of course, in the same typeface, but it is a perfect match.
3721000	3731000	It's sort of like they posted it there and then used the Pathfinder tool in InDesign or something, for anyone who knows what that is.
3731000	3741000	But, um, I guess I see it now. I didn't see it at first until I looked at the logo.
3741000	3748000	It makes sense that, you know, it's time for another Metal Gear Solid. I know they always say the other one's gonna be the last one, but come on.
3748000	3751000	They'll take that until it stops making money.
3751000	3755000	I don't know. I don't know if it's Metal Gear Solid. I think it's New Bionic Commando.
3755000	3756000	And, spoiler!
3756000	3757000	What?
3757000	3760000	His wife is his claw.
3761000	3764000	No.
3764000	3765000	Spoiler!
3765000	3769000	Just look at the picture that I linked in the chat room, guys.
3769000	3774000	That was the plotline in the first Bionic Commando game that they made for you.
3774000	3778000	How does that work? The more time on spoilers is up on the game. I'm never gonna play that game. I wanna know.
3778000	3781000	How does that work? How is his wife the claw?
3781000	3786000	She's the AI that's in there. Like, it's her AI. Or her.
3786000	3787000	So she's GLaDOS.
3787000	3788000	You can marry-
3788000	3789000	Yeah, it's like GLaDOS.
3789000	3790000	You can marry AI.
3790000	3792000	No, the AI can be turned-
3792000	3793000	Well, they dumped her personality in there.
3793000	3797000	The Supreme Court is gonna decide next year if I get to get married or not, but you can marry your AI.
3797000	3801000	To quote Rob, put her in a CD. I don't care.
3801000	3805000	They had all those tubes, and they're like, we need to fill the tubes with something.
3805000	3809000	So they just threw his wife in a wood chipper, shoved her in the tubes for the Bionic Commando.
3809000	3810000	I mean, that's-
3810000	3813000	You shouldn't put your wife in a wood chipper. That's wrong.
3813000	3815000	She'll say she can't, but put her in there anyway.
3815000	3818000	Well, he didn't put her in a- I don't know.
3818000	3821000	Why would you put your wife in a wood chipper? That's really rude.
3821000	3827000	Maybe he's just really into self-gratification, and so, you know, he thought his wife is the claw.
3827000	3828000	That's wrong.
3828000	3829000	Men.
3829000	3831000	Because the claw touches him in ways that-
3831000	3832000	The claw.
3832000	3833000	His hand can't.
3833000	3836000	It decides who will go and who will stay. Ah.
3836000	3839000	Can we please, please get to release dates?
3839000	3840000	I guess.
3840000	3843000	Although I'm not expecting to hear an awful lot, but let's see. Release dates.
3844000	3849000	Alright, so this week we've got the game of the year, The Walking Dead.
3849000	3854000	The whole, basically, season one on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3854000	3857000	007 Legends on the Wii U.
3857000	3860000	I mean, that's pretty awesome, right? Cool.
3865000	3867000	Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U.
3869000	3872000	Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U, like with Vanna White and shit?
3872000	3873000	Yeah. Awesome.
3873000	3874000	Yeah, it's the game-
3874000	3875000	60 bucks?
3875000	3880000	It's the game that they, yeah, it's like 40, I think.
3880000	3885000	It's the game that they put out on the Wii and Xbox 360 earlier.
3885000	3888000	I like Wheel of Fortune. I'm real good at it.
3888000	3891000	Well, there you go. And Jeopardy. Jeopardy on the Wii U.
3891000	3894000	I'm not as good as Jeopardy. That's for smart people.
3897000	3900000	Not anymore, really. Have you ever watched Jeopardy lately?
3900000	3902000	I can only watch Celebrity Jeopardy.
3902000	3903000	And then-
3903000	3905000	Damn you, Trebek!
3906000	3911000	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on the Vita.
3912000	3914000	Oh, I was like, isn't that on every platform?
3914000	3919000	No, not the Vita and 3DS. 3DS got delayed a little further.
3921000	3925000	That's it, and I hate to say it, I think that's it for the rest of the year.
3926000	3931000	Well, we'll check in again next week and see what shovel week they were able to put together in a week.
3932000	3937000	Alright, meanwhile in Japan, there's still some things trickling through. Not a lot, but some things.
3937000	3943000	On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction in the Premium Edition coming out December 13th.
3943000	3947000	Along with, I believe this is a new game, Port Royale 3.
3947000	3951000	I don't recognize this as a series here. Maybe Loki-
3952000	3959000	It came out on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in August, I think.
3959000	3961000	It's like a Pirates game.
3961000	3963000	Yeah, it's a Pirates simulation game.
3963000	3965000	But not Sid Meier's Pirates.
3965000	3969000	No, it's Calypso, I want to say, puts that out.
3969000	3971000	Russell in Japan, but-
3971000	3974000	I think over here it's Calypso.
3975000	3983000	They're the guys that put out Tropico, so it's a trading sim.
3983000	3985000	You can be a pirate or trader.
3985000	3991000	Much busier week on the PlayStation 3, Battlefield 3 also there as well, and Port Royale 3.
3991000	3997000	Ninja Gaiden Sigma also gets a price reduction along with Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus.
3997000	4006000	But as far as new games go, Sango Kushi 12 comes out in regular and Premium Editions from Koei.
4006000	4015000	This is 12. What is this? Is this Nobunaga, like, a new version of it?
4015000	4017000	It very well could be.
4017000	4019000	No, that's Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
4019000	4022000	I just recognized one of the kanji.
4022000	4026000	It's a big release this week too, so that wouldn't surprise me at all.
4026000	4030000	Whenever you see Sangoku, Three Kingdoms.
4030000	4037000	You run a country, build facilities, develop skills. The skills can be military-based, politics-based, or fundamental.
4037000	4039000	Or artistic dance.
4039000	4041000	No, you cannot have artistic dance.
4041000	4046000	Also, price reduction for Sangoku Basara 3 Utage.
4046000	4050000	So lots of price reductions this week, just in time for Christmas.
4050000	4058000	On the Vita this week in Japan, Jikuyu Powerful Pro Yakuyu 2012 Petai Ban.
4058000	4061000	That's the Konami Baseball series on the Vita this week.
4061000	4065000	On the PSP this week, yes, the PSP.
4065000	4068000	7th Dragon 2020 gets a price reduction.
4068000	4075000	And then we have Arcana Famiglia Festa Regalo comes out this week.
4075000	4078000	I have no idea what that is on the PSP.
4078000	4081000	But it has free shipping.
4081000	4083000	Depending where you order it from, yes.
4083000	4086000	These guys are dressed up like it all in little suits.
4086000	4090000	They're little chibi suit characters, but this one has an eye patch, so you know he's rough.
4090000	4092000	Oh, he's badass.
4092000	4093000	He is.
4093000	4094000	I have no idea.
4094000	4098000	That guy looks like a chibi Kratos, and that guy looks like a chibi Cloud, doesn't he?
4098000	4100000	Yeah, then who's the dude with the eye patch?
4100000	4101000	I don't know.
4101000	4102000	Chibi Snake?
4102000	4103000	Could be.
4103000	4107000	Shining Hearts also on the PSP gets a price reduction this week.
4107000	4110000	Going to the Wii U.
4110000	4115000	Sangokushi 12 comes out on the Wii U this week in Japan as well.
4115000	4118000	And lastly, checking the 3DS.
4118000	4121000	Biohazard Mercenaries 3D gets a price reduction.
4121000	4130000	And Inazuma 11 Go 2 Chrono Stone Nepuyu and Ramay come out this week from level 5.
4130000	4133000	And Rob will hyperventilate now.
4133000	4134000	Yes, I will.
4134000	4136000	Oh, Puyo Puyo gets a price reduction.
4136000	4137000	Puyo Puyo.
4137000	4139000	No one cur.
4139000	4140000	I care.
4140000	4143000	Okay, one cur.
4143000	4145000	That does it for Japanese release dates.
4145000	4148000	In Europe, not a damn thing.
4148000	4150000	The end.
4150000	4152000	Seriously, not a damn thing.
4152000	4155000	The game will be out the entire week.
4155000	4158000	A different version for every system that has ever existed all week.
4158000	4161000	I'm serious.
4161000	4163000	Not a damn thing.
4163000	4165000	Just crickets?
4166000	4167000	Just crickets.
4167000	4169000	Nothing until the 17th.
4169000	4170000	Alright.
4170000	4173000	Which is not this week.
4173000	4176000	Let's do a couple more stories before the Classic Game of the Week, then.
4176000	4177000	Alright.
4177000	4184000	So, Motorola has failed to ban the Xbox in both the US and Germany.
4184000	4194000	And apparently, I guess, a judge has ruled that Google's Motorola can't ban the sales of the Xbox 360
4194000	4196000	over a patent dispute.
4196000	4202000	And, of course, no one had any comment on it and the case moves on.
4202000	4206000	So, that's good and kind of what we thought would happen.
4206000	4210000	I don't think they would ban the sale over that, but.
4210000	4214000	Yeah, can you imagine if they just suddenly pulled the Xbox 360 off of Shells?
4214000	4218000	They're just gonna, you know, go through the courts right now and I'm sure at the end
4218000	4221000	that they're gonna settle or have to pay some sort of royalties or something.
4221000	4222000	Somebody's going to.
4222000	4223000	So, we'll see.
4223000	4231000	Going to a game that once could have been, but it's not gonna be, Guitar Hero 7.
4231000	4234000	Guitar Hero 7, at one point, it was gonna happen.
4234000	4238000	It was in development, but Activision canned it in 2011.
4238000	4244000	This is all coming from an anonymous source via Kotaku, so take it with a huge grain of salt.
4244000	4246000	But, it certainly sounds plausible.
4247000	4252000	Guitar Hero 7 was going back to the roots, meaning it was only gonna use a guitar.
4252000	4255000	So, it was gonna lose the drums, the mic, and all that other stuff.
4255000	4258000	Rock Band kind of had the lock on that, so it was gonna go back to just guitar.
4258000	4260000	But, the guitar was gonna go through some changes.
4260000	4264000	A full six strings and an extra button in the neck.
4264000	4267000	However, the guitar apparently was expensive.
4267000	4271000	It was a disaster. Unresponsive.
4271000	4274000	So, that was not gonna be happening.
4274000	4277000	Vicarious Visions was the team that was developing it.
4277000	4283000	They were gonna do this thing where the music video would actually change for each song.
4283000	4290000	So, they were trying to separate themselves from Rock Band, which I applaud.
4290000	4294000	But, I don't know. I guess maybe this music video thing wasn't really working out.
4294000	4299000	But, maybe that would have been the theme, was making music videos like MTV.
4299000	4301000	Apparently, the songs were not that great either.
4301000	4305000	It was all the worst hits from the 1990s.
4305000	4309000	In other words, stuff like Closing Time and Sex and Candy.
4309000	4311000	Closing Time.
4311000	4314000	Remember, that's the old outro for this show.
4314000	4317000	I know, but to tell you something else about that.
4317000	4322000	In magazine class, last time we did it, not this semester, but last year.
4322000	4328000	At the end of every class, we would play that song right before we had our meeting.
4328000	4331000	That's what that song makes me think of.
4331000	4334000	And yes, some good conversation in chat.
4334000	4337000	VX Jason XV is like, why the jump to 7?
4337000	4339000	I knew there was Guitar Hero 4.
4339000	4343000	And Oren G points out Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.
4343000	4345000	So, there were other games in between.
4345000	4347000	That's not even counting the spinoff games.
4347000	4349000	Like, there was Band Hero.
4349000	4352000	Was that the Taylor Swift one was Band Hero?
4352000	4353000	What was the family hero?
4353000	4354000	Who gives a crap about Taylor Swift?
4354000	4355000	I'm just saying.
4355000	4358000	It was Band Hero and then...
4358000	4362000	I don't know if they had anything else other than Band Hero.
4362000	4366000	We all stopped paying attention after Guitar Hero 3, okay?
4366000	4367000	I'm just saying.
4367000	4369000	Not to mention all the band-specific ones.
4369000	4373000	Van Halen, Aerosmith, Metallica.
4373000	4378000	Guitar Hero 7 was cancelled in the middle of its two-year development cycle.
4378000	4380000	It could have been out by now.
4380000	4381000	It could have been.
4381000	4384000	Kind of wish they'd have a new DJ hero.
4384000	4385000	Right?
4385000	4388000	You know, I picked up DJ Hero for 20 bucks.
4388000	4392000	It's awesome. Seriously, the soundtrack is still awesome.
4392000	4394000	That's a game that could have won it for the soundtrack.
4394000	4396000	I need to go back and play that game again.
4396000	4398000	There's some really good mixes in that game.
4398000	4401000	It's awfully sad.
4401000	4408000	Well, remember a time when we didn't have seven versions of a particular game?
4408000	4409000	Yes, we did.
4409000	4410000	Well, unless it was Mega Man.
4410000	4412000	No, unless it was Street Fighter 2.
4412000	4413000	Oh yeah, there is that.
4413000	4414000	There is that.
4414000	4416000	Is this game before or after Street Fighter 2?
4416000	4418000	As we get into the classic game of the week,
4418000	4420000	where Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault
4420000	4424000	and find a game that is older or about the same age as Street Fighter 2.
4424000	4425000	Contemporary.
4425000	4429000	And say, hey, you should be playing this game this week, dammit.
4429000	4431000	Yeah, dammit.
4431000	4434000	And this is another one that Dan picked out,
4434000	4436000	because I couldn't think of anything.
4436000	4437000	Sunset Riders.
4437000	4438000	This is a good pick.
4438000	4439000	Did you ever play it?
4439000	4441000	I did.
4441000	4442000	Sunset Riders.
4442000	4446000	Actually, I have played it.
4446000	4451000	The only place that had one was in an arcade,
4451000	4453000	which was a tilt arcade in Dothan, Alabama,
4453000	4455000	and then it was gone.
4455000	4459000	But Sunset Riders is a side-scrolling game,
4459000	4463000	and you basically run around and shoot guys with your guns,
4463000	4469000	and you jump from back to back of stampeding cattle and ride horses.
4469000	4475000	And it's like, I like how the article says it's a fanciful Wild West.
4475000	4477000	Old West.
4477000	4482000	In the co-op version, you could either do a two or four player,
4482000	4485000	and you could get hookers and boos, Rob.
4485000	4488000	That's always the best, isn't it? Hookers and boos.
4488000	4493000	So the game was supposed to be set, like I said, in the American Old West,
4493000	4496000	and it's four bounty hunters who are out to get the rewards
4496000	4499000	of the most wanted outlaws in the West.
4499000	4503000	And in between each stage, it shows you a wanted poster of whoever it is
4503000	4506000	and your reward and wanted dead or alive.
4506000	4508000	You know, that type of thing.
4508000	4512000	So you play as Steve and Billy,
4512000	4516000	and their guns are peacemakers, which are faster.
4516000	4519000	And then you have Bob and Cormano,
4519000	4521000	which I don't even know if that's a real name,
4521000	4523000	but I was laughing because he's wearing a pink poncho.
4523000	4527000	And they both use shotguns, so they have wider shots.
4527000	4531000	And in the two player mode,
4531000	4534000	you actually can choose the character you want to control
4534000	4535000	before you start the game.
4535000	4538000	But in four player, each person is assigned to a character,
4538000	4540000	kind of like how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was.
4540000	4542000	Just like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
4542000	4546000	which is clearly the engine this game is using, just saying.
4548000	4552000	This is definitely, they're trying to make lightning strike twice after that
4552000	4554000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.
4554000	4556000	It's clearly the same hardware, which is fine.
4556000	4558000	But this game has hookers.
4558000	4561000	See, look, he goes in the room and there's a hooker.
4561000	4563000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had April O'Neil.
4563000	4565000	She wasn't a hooker.
4565000	4566000	She did have clean stuff.
4566000	4568000	Some of the pictures I've seen she is.
4568000	4570000	Clearly you haven't been on Tumblr.
4570000	4573000	Anyway, any, whatever.
4573000	4574000	Dirty Men.
4574000	4575000	Everyone can be a hooker on Tumblr.
4575000	4576000	Dirty Men.
4576000	4577000	Okay.
4577000	4578000	Especially Hawkeye.
4578000	4581000	Yeah, well, the Hawkeye initiative is awesome.
4582000	4585000	So, anyway, you can jump from different floors,
4585000	4588000	which use the joystick and jump, you know, the usual thing.
4588000	4591000	You can shoot downwards diagonally or vertically while crouching.
4591000	4597000	And, I mean, it's basic, you know, run and gun controls for a game like this.
4597000	4603000	You have badge shaped power-ups that you get by beating these guys carrying sacks.
4603000	4606000	The silver badge gives you a second gun,
4606000	4608000	so you can shoot in two directions at the same time.
4608000	4613000	And the gold badge lets you fire continuously when you hold down the shoot button.
4613000	4616000	And you can use both power-ups together.
4616000	4620000	There's eight stages and you basically have to reach the end of each stage
4620000	4623000	and beat the bad guy and get your money.
4623000	4624000	Yee-haw.
4624000	4627000	Although when I saw the first boss, I was asking Dan today,
4627000	4629000	is he not wearing any pants?
4629000	4631000	Because it looked like he wasn't wearing pants.
4631000	4633000	I think it was just the perspective in the game.
4633000	4636000	And Dan said that the only people not wearing pants were the hookers.
4636000	4638000	And the cowgirl, which he just shot.
4638000	4639000	And those chickens.
4639000	4640000	And the chickens.
4640000	4642000	And the stampede and cattle.
4642000	4643000	They're not wearing pants either.
4643000	4645000	Wasn't that a scene in the Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?
4645000	4647000	I don't know if I know. I haven't seen it.
4647000	4652000	So you get your power-ups, like I said, if you have rapid fire, dual fire,
4652000	4654000	and you also get a monetary award.
4654000	4656000	Or a turkey worth $500.
4656000	4658000	I've never seen a turkey worth $500.
4658000	4659000	I'm sure that has to be...
4659000	4661000	You're not doing enough shopping at Whole Foods.
4661000	4662000	Whole Paycheck.
4662000	4668000	So the stages are, you have Simon Greedwell, Hawkeye Hank Hatfield,
4668000	4675000	Dark Horse, which just makes me think of Bad Horse in Dr. Horrible.
4675000	4681000	The Smith Brothers, El Greco, wouldn't that mean the Greek?
4681000	4685000	Bob, is it like Greco, Spanish for Greek?
4685000	4686000	Sure.
4686000	4687000	Okay.
4688000	4689000	Chief Scalpem.
4689000	4691000	Oh, Scalpem, which is...
4691000	4693000	Oh, insensitive.
4693000	4695000	Paco Loco.
4695000	4702000	And Sir Richard Rose, a British man who's shooting from the balcony behind two lions.
4702000	4704000	There were...
4704000	4708000	I'm trying to find my favorite part, which is...
4708000	4710000	Oh yeah, the stuff about the SNES version.
4710000	4712000	Okay, I'm going to get back into that.
4712000	4714000	There were two major ports.
4714000	4717000	There was the Mega Drive version, which was the Sega Genesis,
4717000	4720000	where it actually...
4720000	4724000	Two of the characters in the Genesis version were given surnames when they didn't have one.
4724000	4727000	It was Billy Cool and Cormano Wild.
4727000	4729000	So they were cool and wild, apparently.
4729000	4735000	And only four of the bosses were there, so the four chapters were divided into two stages.
4735000	4741000	And the bosses in this version were Greedwell, Paco Loco, Scalpem, and Richard Rose.
4741000	4745000	And the bounties were different. They were increased depending on who it was.
4745000	4751000	And the Genesis one had what looks like a two-player versus mode, where you could fight each other in a gunfight.
4751000	4755000	The SNES version had fewer changes.
4755000	4760000	You could still play only up to two players at a time, but it had all eight stages with their bosses.
4760000	4766000	And all the power-ups were the same, but there were some different...
4766000	4768000	I would say...
4768000	4771000	Censoring done.
4771000	4775000	The whore that... I'm just going to call her a whore. I don't care.
4775000	4781000	She's supposed to be, I guess, like a bar girl, but she's totally done like an old West call girl.
4781000	4786000	She kisses the player in stage one and the saloon dancers in stage four.
4786000	4788000	They're dressed more conservatively.
4788000	4794000	The hunter dogs were taken out of the SNES version, but they were in the Genesis version.
4794000	4803000	And the Native American enemies were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpem, who was renamed to Chief Wigwam.
4803000	4806000	Yeah, because that's just as good.
4806000	4812000	And the dynamite-tossing female bandits were taken out as well, but they were still in the Genesis version.
4812000	4815000	So, yeah, sunset riders.
4815000	4820000	Which I also think is funny, because you know how when you're reading the articles they have a C also?
4820000	4825000	I love that it lists Wild West CAW boys of Moomasa.
4825000	4827000	That's just wonderful.
4827000	4832000	I like the stage where you're going along the train and shooting the bandits.
4832000	4834000	Yee-haw!
4834000	4840000	You know, you say that, and then you mention Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and now I'm thinking, yee-haw, Ninja Cowboy.
4840000	4846000	Well, in chat they were talking about Gunsmoke, the NES game. You know, kind of like the other Western shooter game.
4846000	4847000	Yeah.
4847000	4853000	See, Dan kept correcting me and saying Call Girl, and I'm like, it's a whore.
4853000	4855000	She's a whore.
4855000	4857000	She is a whore.
4857000	4859000	My mom says, a whore.
4859000	4863000	She walks the night. She is a tramp.
4866000	4869000	There it is, your Classic Game of the Week. Sunset Riders.
4869000	4873000	And no, I'm not doing Mass Effect for Classic Game. It's not old enough yet.
4873000	4875000	It's getting there.
4875000	4877000	I'll Classic Game you.
4877000	4879000	I don't know. It feels like it's that old.
4879000	4881000	Fine. Next week, Mass Effect.
4881000	4884000	No. Games have to be at least ten years old. Alright.
4884000	4887000	And yes, Fifth Dream, my mom really actually does say it that way.
4887000	4888000	Who-er.
4888000	4889000	Who-er?
4889000	4891000	My mom, well, my granddaddy said it that way.
4891000	4895000	My granddaddy was from Bridgeport, Connecticut, and my mom's a Southern girl.
4895000	4897000	So it translated to Who-er.
4897000	4900000	Alright, enough whore talk. More talk about the Classic Game of the Week.
4900000	4901000	We need more whores!
4901000	4902000	Sunset Riders.
4902000	4904000	Whores need love too, only they charge for it.
4904000	4906000	We've got plenty more show to come.
4906000	4910000	We're gonna talk some Microsoft, Cloud Gaming, Idol Master.
4910000	4911000	Yes, Idol Master.
4911000	4912000	And whores.
4912000	4913000	Maybe some whores.
4913000	4919000	Maybe some whores will call us at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio.
4919000	4921000	That is our name on Skype.
4921000	4923000	We will be taking calls after the break.
4923000	4926000	When we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio, stay tuned.
4926000	4942000	Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio Live on this Sunday evening, December the 9th of 2012, with the 485th episode of our show.
4942000	4944000	We're about to get into rapid-fire news.
4944000	4948000	Myself and Loki here in the studio and DarkSakura in the kitchen.
4948000	4953000	She volunteered. She's in there. She's making more latkes.
4953000	4958000	Alan, you are not prepared for the mountain of latkes that are gonna be here when you get home.
4958000	4960000	I hope you like potatoes.
4960000	4961000	And matzah.
4961000	4962000	And matzah.
4962000	4964000	They're good, though. Not gonna lie.
4964000	4969000	All right. Anyhow, while she finishes those up, we will get into some rapid-fire news.
4969000	4971000	I gotta talk about this real quick, though.
4971000	4973000	Loki, do you play a lot of fighting games, Loki?
4973000	4976000	You don't talk a lot about fighting games. Do you play a lot?
4976000	4977000	No, not really.
4977000	4980000	Not really? Did you ever play Capcom vs. SNK 2?
4980000	4981000	That was…
4981000	4982000	I think so.
4982000	4984000	Well, you know why you probably would have played it?
4984000	4988000	Is that that was the big fighting game they had at Golf Land back when we all were playing DDR.
4988000	4990000	I've played it on my MAME cabinet, so…
4990000	4991000	Okay.
4991000	4996000	Well, during the break, we were playing just some random music from games.
4996000	4998000	That's what we usually do for the live break.
4998000	5001000	So we can, like, get water, use the restroom, and do all that live.
5001000	5002000	The pod…
5002000	5004000	Make… Make latkes, like DarkSakura's doing.
5006000	5007000	And what have you.
5007000	5010000	And you guys during the podcast don't get that, but we play some music.
5010000	5014000	And while the Capcom vs. SNK 2 song was playing, somebody in chat said…
5014000	5015000	Where was this?
5015000	5017000	S2100Matt said,
5017000	5022000	There isn't an HD remix of Capcom vs. SNK 2 coming out anytime soon, huh?
5022000	5024000	And it made me think, no there's not.
5024000	5027000	And that made me sad that there is no…
5027000	5028000	Oh my god, that's a lot.
5028000	5030000	DarkSakura, you are making me so fat.
5030000	5031000	So?
5031000	5033000	I am fat because of you.
5033000	5035000	Look at your life, look at your choices.
5036000	5038000	Anyway, no HD version of it.
5038000	5043000	For me to sit on my fat ass and eat latkes and play Capcom vs. SNK 2 HD.
5043000	5045000	That is just not happening.
5045000	5046000	No.
5046000	5047000	That makes me sad.
5047000	5048000	Yeah.
5048000	5051000	I guess it's all the rights issues, but it is frustrating.
5051000	5053000	You see, like, DarkStalkers and Street Fighter 3.
5053000	5057000	Well, they're probably right now, they're working with, you know, Namco and that stuff.
5057000	5063000	So maybe they just, you know, because right now I think SNK is being distributed through Atlas.
5063000	5066000	Because the last game that they had was King of Fighters.
5066000	5067000	King of Fighters, yeah.
5067000	5073000	So, I mean, I would imagine that Atlas would work with them.
5073000	5078000	After all, I don't know if you guys know, it's Persona 4 Arena, best fighting game.
5078000	5082000	Which is very unusual.
5082000	5087000	I mean, you would think that that might go to, like, Street Fighter X Tekken or something like that.
5087000	5092000	Or even, I don't know if it's too late, but PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or something like that.
5093000	5098000	But definitely going a little bit more niche with who's winning these things.
5098000	5099000	Very interesting.
5099000	5102000	Well, sometimes the Oscars don't always go to the big budget movies.
5102000	5104000	In fact, they often don't.
5104000	5105000	They go to the niche stuff.
5105000	5107000	Maybe the VGA is taking a nod from that.
5107000	5108000	I don't know.
5108000	5109000	It's interesting.
5109000	5110000	Let's see.
5110000	5115000	Chatters are complaining that they are not getting latkes.
5115000	5116000	Come over.
5116000	5118000	Tell them to make your own damn latkes.
5119000	5122000	Dark Soccer is yelling from the kitchen, make your own damn latkes.
5122000	5124000	Dark Soccer is going to set off the smoke alarm.
5124000	5125000	Watch.
5125000	5126000	It's over.
5126000	5128000	No, it's over here.
5128000	5130000	Yeah, good idea.
5130000	5132000	The last thing we need.
5132000	5141000	I can say that's one thing that hasn't happened in 11 years of Orange Launch Radio is that we've had to evacuate.
5141000	5146000	I've set up the smoke alarm before when drinking bacon late at night.
5146000	5151000	But then we had the smoke alarm defense system, whereas the giant fan aimed at the smoke alarm.
5151000	5153000	We've had the power go out.
5153000	5155000	We've passed out drunk during the show.
5155000	5157000	We've never had to evacuate.
5157000	5158000	That is.
5158000	5159000	Yeah.
5159000	5160000	Oh, yeah, that's true.
5160000	5161000	We did.
5161000	5163000	We lost the soundboard.
5163000	5164000	All right.
5164000	5167000	Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.
5167000	5170000	Some quick news stories for you guys.
5170000	5172000	Loki starting us off.
5172000	5175000	So Minecraft's getting another update as they tend to do.
5175000	5179000	Of course, we know the big update, the Redstone updates coming in January.
5179000	5181000	But until then, they're going to get some smaller updates.
5181000	5183000	One point four six is going to be the next one.
5183000	5193000	And some of the things you can expect for one point four six that are actually available right now in Snapshot 12 W forty nine a include fireworks.
5193000	5198000	Yes, it's only, I don't know, five months late, but fireworks are getting added in.
5198000	5208000	You can actually craft different colored fireworks, fireworks that sparkle, fireworks that go higher, lower and even fireworks that are shaped like creepers.
5208000	5217000	And then also there's supposed to be some a book that you can use to enchant items and of course, other bug fixes and stuff.
5217000	5222000	But one point four six is supposed to be released sometime before Christmas.
5222000	5225000	So next week or so.
5225000	5232000	You know who I found out today plays Minecraft, my nine year old cousin.
5232000	5237000	I thought it was interesting. You can join the VOG network.
5237000	5240000	I think it's not. I don't trust that. We seriously had a moment.
5240000	5245000	We had we had someone join this week and they're like, is this seriously?
5245000	5248000	No one on here all the time. Like, I'm on here.
5248000	5254000	And his mom was telling me, do you know how many viruses we've gotten on our computer?
5254000	5259000	Because he keeps trying to find a free version of Minecraft. There is no such thing as a new version of Minecraft.
5259000	5265000	There are all virus. I had I had we had to kind of explain that because it's like, yeah, you have to log in with your account.
5265000	5270000	There's you can play in cracked servers is the only way he can get around that.
5270000	5276000	Well, it's not even I said you can do the free version that doesn't have all the I mean, he's nine.
5276000	5282000	He's not going to miss all that stuff. Although he was asking me, he's like, have you ever built a nether portal?
5282000	5288000	I'm like, no. A nine year old just kicked my ass at a video game.
5288000	5292000	You didn't have to because we did it all for you. There's like 50 of them.
5292000	5298000	Yeah, I know. All right. So Last of Us was revealed to be coming out May seven.
5298000	5302000	This is coming from the trailer that played during the VGA. So, yay.
5302000	5307000	Another game. And last but not least, in the realm of I don't give a shit about this,
5307000	5313000	but we're going to report it anyways, because originally it had something to do with gaming, but now it's so far away from gaming.
5313000	5317000	G4 or what used to be G4 is now becoming the Esquire channel.
5317000	5323000	Wow. I could really care less about that. In fact, I do care about as little about that as possible.
5323000	5329000	But apparently it is a network that is going to be aimed at the metro sexual male.
5329000	5335000	That has to be a joke by the writer. I don't think they actually are targeting the metro sexual male,
5335000	5343000	although that would be kind of funny if they were. They're saying that the channel will feature some gaming oriented material.
5343000	5350000	And of course, subjects also is fashion, cooking and travel.
5350000	5358000	Vomit is what I say. I don't know. I hope this I hope this crashes and burns pretty fast.
5358000	5363000	And honestly, I think it will. Dark soccer. Do you think metro sexual is hot?
5363000	5367000	Whatever that's supposed to mean anyway. Huh? Metro sexual. I know.
5367000	5371000	And I'm like, huh? I need to know that I like it authentic.
5371000	5377000	I want to know where they can be running reruns of Queer Eye for the straight guy, because that's, you know, pretty metro sexual right there.
5377000	5381000	They should reboot it. Actually, what was we watched?
5381000	5386000	What was it? We watched the pilot episode of that. And it's like, whoa, this is weird.
5386000	5390000	The British version was really good. Different people on here. OK.
5390000	5394000	Alan's a big fan of the Nerdist and Chris Hardwick and all that. Yeah.
5394000	5398000	So, like, he likes to listen to podcasts that aren't mine. So that's fine.
5398000	5401000	He listens to mine, too. But he likes to listen to he's probably listening now.
5401000	5404000	In fact, he likes to listen to the Nerdist with Chris Hardwick.
5404000	5413000	And I guess they've been doing a lot of because I guess somebody involved with that show is involved with Attack of the Show right now after Kevin Pereira left and all that.
5413000	5420000	And I guess they say that this network is supposed to be brovo is what they're calling brovo instead of Bravo.
5420000	5425000	It's brovo. So I'm like the real dude bros of Orange County.
5425000	5430000	What exactly does that mean? What is the real duper would be pretty?
5430000	5434000	It actually would be a fucking awesome show, dude.
5434000	5444000	Dude, dude, dude, sir, for dudes.
5444000	5452000	Fist bump, Loki fist bump.
5452000	5455000	Moving on.
5455000	5463000	An update to the humble bundle. Do you ever fist bump people? Dark soccer all the time.
5463000	5472000	The humble THQ bundle has added, you know, sometimes the bundles kind of add some deals later on in the life.
5472000	5478000	The humble THQ bundle is no different. It got the Red Faction Armageddon DLC called Path of War.
5478000	5481000	Titan Quest was also added to the bundle.
5481000	5489000	Titan Quest was a Diablo style RPG created by Iron Lore Studios back when they existed.
5489000	5494000	The humble THQ bundle. By the way, you don't have to rebuy the bundle to get those games.
5494000	5499000	Just log back into the humble bundle site or use your reuse your code, whatever.
5499000	5506000	You'll get the games to two million dollars earned in twenty four hours, six days to go.
5506000	5513000	Actually, no, that was three days left, about three point seven million made.
5513000	5519000	So it's probably up to about four million by now. The average price of the bundle, five dollars and fifty eight cents.
5519000	5525000	And as the article here points out, four and a half shares of THQ stock.
5525000	5529000	Same price. Amazing.
5529000	5538000	I didn't know this was a thing, but more import games apparently still coming to the PlayStation Store in the form of PlayStation one classics.
5538000	5546000	And Gung Ho Online America getting these old Japanese only games and repackaging them for the PlayStation one import store.
5546000	5553000	I think it's a great idea. I don't know if I'd play any of these games, but Zanuck cross Zanuck.
5553000	5563000	Kendo rage sequel, Makaruna Makeno 2, Vehicle Cavalier, which was a vehicle combat game with mechs.
5563000	5566000	Art Kami and Suguro Kuren.
5566000	5579000	That was a board game about Dakota trucks in Japan and Loop Salad, which was a match three puzzle game and finger flashing, which was basically a rock, paper, scissors action game.
5579000	5584000	Not naked fingers. No finger flashing like that.
5584000	5591000	I just flashed one of my fingers at Dark Sakura was the one that I retorted only to be polite.
5591000	5599000	Streets of Rage apparently at one point had a remake. I don't know what kind of like stage this concept was in.
5599000	5606000	This could even be a fan thing for all we know. No, I don't think so. It was confirmed by the studio.
5606000	5612000	Oh, Sean Noonan was the tweeter that said seems one of my previous projects is leaked.
5612000	5618000	So it actually kind of shows. It looked pretty bad ass. Yeah. You look in this video here. It does look kind of neat.
5618000	5625000	It's a little more open world than side scroller, but it has that very neon look to it.
5625000	5629000	And you can, you know, watch the guys beating each other up there in the video.
5629000	5634000	Ubisoft level designer Sean Noonan. That was the guy that leaked it through Twitter.
5634000	5638000	It was reportedly in development. I'm sorry. He confirmed the leak through Twitter.
5638000	5642000	He didn't leak it himself. Reportedly was in development at Ruffian Games.
5642000	5648000	There was supposed to be destructible environments, takedowns, street gangs.
5648000	5653000	But canceled. Not happening.
5653000	5659000	Guess it just wasn't good enough. Some things are not meant to be.
5659000	5669000	All right. That does it for my rapid fire news. Well, now, did you ever have a TI calculator?
5669000	5674000	I sure did. In AP calculus. I sure did. Well, I didn't take calculus.
5674000	5678000	I had one just so I could play pole position and then make it say rude things.
5678000	5683000	I was on my way to take calculus and I was in pre calc. Unfortunately, I spent too much time programming on my calculator.
5683000	5688000	I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game, but. And now we have Dissidia.
5688000	5696000	You should see how they quit. Well, now they've made a portal on a TI 85 calculator.
5696000	5701000	You can actually play kind of a weird version of Portal where.
5701000	5707000	I guess it's like the the flash one where it's just sort of from the side.
5707000	5712000	I couldn't really tell the video is not playing on my. Yeah, it was it was from the side.
5712000	5717000	And, you know, you could shoot portals out in like eight directions.
5717000	5720000	And they actually had puzzles and a little bit of a story that goes along.
5720000	5723000	So it's pretty cool. That's pretty cool.
5723000	5731000	Also, on Wii U, Rayman's Legend comes out in the UK on March 1st and in North America on February 26th.
5731000	5736000	So for people who are interested in that and have to say it's still looking good.
5736000	5740000	And then that's going to be available for people hither and yon.
5740000	5746000	And then Gianna Sister's Twisted Dreams will be on Xbox Live Arcade next spring.
5746000	5751000	They will be seeing it. It was one of the green light titles and I have it.
5751000	5759000	It's pretty. I haven't really gotten a chance to play much of it, but we shall be seeing it on Xbox.
5759000	5763000	There you go. Well, that's cool that it made its way to Xbox. Yeah.
5763000	5768000	Not bad for Kickstarter, huh? Yeah. It's a fantastic game that I have yet to play.
5768000	5775000	I have it. I have it. I bought it because I backed the Kickstarter, but I haven't played it yet.
5777000	5782000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
5782000	5787000	use the passphrase, cereal, as in breakfast, cereal.
5787000	5789000	Let's go to the foogle question of the week.
5797000	5801000	Every week we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook and Google+.
5801000	5804000	You smoosh it together. That's foogle.
5804000	5809000	This week I was kind of a goober and I forgot to post the question in a timely manner.
5809000	5814000	So as soon as I joined chat, they were like, Rob, you have not posted the foogle question of the week.
5814000	5820000	So one of our chatters, Raginator, just said, here, I'm going to give you a question totally free of charge.
5820000	5824000	I was like, OK. And so Raginator is asking the foogle question this week.
5824000	5829000	What is one thing that you learned in quotes from video games over the years?
5829000	5831000	I thought it was I thought it was a good question.
5831000	5835000	And you know, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.
5835000	5839000	So if one of you wants to ask the question tonight, go for it.
5839000	5843000	I think it was a great idea. So let's see what the listeners said.
5843000	5849000	Let's start tonight on Google+. We had a couple answers on Google+.
5849000	5856000	Redertainment says, before Assassin's Creed, I didn't know Leonardo da Vinci was gay.
5856000	5861000	Now I know. And knowing is half the battle. I didn't. Is that true?
5861000	5866000	Or is that just a like stereotype? I think it's a it's a speculation.
5866000	5871000	I see. But then again, you know, that type thing was punishable by death back then.
5871000	5875000	Unfortunate act. Deaf has an answer. English.
5875000	5879000	Well, I learned the language when I was little, but video games helped me master it.
5879000	5884000	Quite probably the reason I have a B.A. in translation to never thought of that.
5884000	5888000	But what a great way to learn a language playing a video game.
5888000	5891000	Although then again, some translations may not be the best way to learn English.
5891000	5894000	I mean, some of the ones back in the day were pretty bad.
5894000	5898000	But I think that's a really neat, you know, way to learn a language.
5898000	5903000	Think about like an MMO when you have to really surround yourself with the language.
5903000	5906000	It's immersion. Of course, you get a lot of net speak, too.
5906000	5910000	That kind of screws it up. Like people typing U for Y O U.
5910000	5914000	That's I hate it. Appreciate music.
5914000	5924000	Act F goes on to say I love music and video games helped appreciate all help me appreciate all kinds of music during my early years and especially during my teens.
5924000	5931000	Without that, probably I wouldn't be doing. I love that music, which is a segment from on Vogue Network dot com.
5931000	5935000	Today, I've learned lots of trivial things, too, but those two are the most important.
5936000	5941000	Good answers over there on Google Plus. Let's try Facebook. Quite a few answers on Facebook.
5941000	5944000	They're all pretty short, so I'll try to read as many of these as I can.
5944000	5950000	Raginator answered his own question. I've learned that, quote, herbs, quote, are good for your health.
5950000	5955000	And I think those in Washington state would be inclined to agree.
5955000	5959000	I see the joke there. I mean, really, though, there were a lot of speaking of early RPGs.
5959000	5964000	It was always the herb that would suddenly make you feel better and just make you forget all the pain.
5964000	5972000	We used to say when you mix the brown, the red herb and the green herb and you got the brown pile, we would just call it the brown pile or crap.
5972000	5977000	Or you mix the green herb and the pink herb and suddenly you want to watch a lot of My Little Pony.
5977000	5981000	Nothing will make me want to watch a lot of My Little Pony, Rob.
5981000	5986000	Brandon H on Facebook said, Don't try to text in the middle of a race.
5986000	5992000	I don't know if that means Mario Kart or like an actual race, but, you know, just don't text and drive kids.
5992000	5995000	Doesn't even work in games.
5995000	6003000	Katsuhiko J replied and said, Save your game, save often. Ain't that the truth?
6003000	6008000	Surely you've lost progress in Mass Effect due to lack of saving. Yes, DarkSakura?
6008000	6011000	No, actually, because I save often.
6011000	6013000	All right. You learned that lesson, huh?
6013000	6019000	I also have multiple saves at the same place. I have different colors of skin and hair and different hairstyles and eye colors on my Shepard.
6019000	6020000	Nerd.
6020000	6026000	Gamer Girl replied and said, Keep calm and keep playing because nothing in a game is as bad as real life.
6026000	6032000	At least, unlike life, in a game, there are do-overs and extra lives.
6032000	6038000	What a nice, simple, good answer to the question, right?
6038000	6042000	Don't throw your controllers. Don't get mad. It's not real life.
6042000	6045000	And you get three lives, unlike real life.
6045000	6050000	So don't kill yourself with a PlayStation 3 controller. Out of rage.
6050000	6056000	Degenerate Johnny replies and said, I've learned that Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space.
6056000	6059000	Yes. Yes.
6059000	6062000	What is that from? I didn't get the reference.
6062000	6063000	Mass Effect 2.
6063000	6064000	Where?
6064000	6068000	Okay. When you get to the Citadel, right?
6068000	6069000	Yeah.
6069000	6074000	And there's the military guys standing out there talking to the other two across from the help desk before you go into C-Sec?
6074000	6075000	Yeah.
6075000	6081000	And he goes, What is the first law of physics? An object in motion tends to stay in motion, sir.
6081000	6084000	I did not pay you for half an answer. Give me the whole thing.
6084000	6088000	You know, that type of thing. It's like, until acted upon about an outside object, sir.
6088000	6093000	Do you know if you shoot this missile through, you know, blah, blah, it will always hit something.
6093000	6094000	You're just going off on it.
6094000	6099000	That means that Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest motherfucker in the galaxy.
6099000	6102000	I don't even remember that. Is that just background dialogue?
6102000	6106000	No. You stop and you activate them to listen to it.
6106000	6108000	I just forgot.
6108000	6112000	Broseidon. I wonder if he'll have a show on Brovo.
6112000	6118000	Broseidon answers and says, Don't ever think you're better than the game because the game decides if you're going to win,
6118000	6123000	or if it might just freeze and glitch and make your past 36 hours pointless.
6123000	6128000	You need to see the rule earlier, Broseidon, that says save now, save often.
6128000	6134000	Jovidea says, I've learned that when trying to perform operations on the Wii and Trauma Center,
6134000	6140000	it is oftentimes easier to operate while drunk. This makes me question real doctors.
6140000	6148000	Yes, because Trauma Center is real life. Your real doctors draw a pentagram shape in order to invoke the magic.
6149000	6156000	Her. Burr replied and said, I learned you only live once. Yolo.
6156000	6162000	Wait, that can't be right. You missed the one on the three lives. Hello.
6162000	6171000	Cram replied and said, Save often. Having to replay several hours can leave a game unfinished for a long time.
6171000	6179000	Loco Poco replied and said, I've learned that flashing your breasts to your opponent is the best kind of fatality to finish them off.
6179000	6184000	Learned from Black Orchid and Killer Instinct.
6184000	6189000	Is that a good life lesson, Dark Sakura? Do you flash your breasts at opponents to kill them off?
6189000	6192000	I flash them at Dan to get him to shut up.
6192000	6195000	Close enough.
6195000	6203000	Silent Tom replies and says, I've learned over the years that the princess is always in another castle.
6203000	6207000	And if you chop down enough grass, you're bound to find money.
6207000	6210000	Those are both good life lessons, wouldn't you say?
6210000	6217000	A sale of Sumer Gawa replies and says, if the camera focuses on it, it's important.
6217000	6222000	Here it is. Your answer. So in that alive, the breasts are important.
6222000	6228000	Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio and you can find our community on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.
6228000	6230000	I did learn something, by the way.
6230000	6232000	That was a good question, Raginator. Good job.
6232000	6234000	I learned something last night, Rob.
6234000	6238000	My hacked Mass Effect 3 will now work in multiplayer.
6238000	6241000	As long as I don't hit the button.
6241000	6246000	Oh, you. All right. Let's move on with some more news.
6247000	6251000	So there has been a listing on LinkedIn.
6251000	6257000	There one ads for, I guess, a Microsoft's interactive entertainment business studio Soho.
6257000	6263000	They're seeking a television producer to develop and deliver a number of new TV products.
6263000	6275000	Basically, it says Soho Productions is pushing the boundaries of Kinect and Xbox Live and would like to bring a new line of interactive television experiences to the world.
6275000	6284000	Working with leading global entertainment partners, we're creating experiences that are not bound by the traditional definitions of television or gaming.
6284000	6291000	Experiences where watching and participating are inseparable and will delight and enrich the lives of people everywhere.
6291000	6295000	So this kind of goes back to a few different rumors.
6295000	6303000	One, that this might be something that's incorporated into the next Xbox system and also to that whole set top box thing that they're going to be putting out.
6303000	6310000	To me, it sounds like they're kind of building on the whole, you know, Kinect TV stuff.
6310000	6318000	You know, like what they did with Sesame Street and not Geo, that they're going to be doing some other types of interactive TV things.
6318000	6323000	Maybe bringing back 1 versus 100 or something like that might be kind of cool.
6323000	6328000	So that's what it sounds like to me or maybe it's just something else.
6328000	6337000	But hopefully it's not implemented really stupid like, now you can vote on this, you know, thing or something.
6337000	6339000	Do you like Xbox or not?
6339000	6342000	You know, I think you're doing something similar for the Spike VGA.
6342000	6345000	It's where they had it where you can stream it and interact with TV and stuff.
6345000	6348000	They were doing it for the political debates on Xbox Live.
6348000	6351000	Yeah, so maybe they're going to be kind of doing something like that.
6351000	6356000	It seems like the way that they would go, but they're trying to maybe new content, which would be cool.
6356000	6361000	I'm all for new content, especially if it's not any additional cost to me.
6361000	6368000	Well, I think we've known for a while that they're toying with the idea of doing like a Microsoft channel type of thing on Xbox.
6368000	6373000	Or at least, you know, I don't know, more of that interactive kind of television style content.
6373000	6380000	Although it does seem weird that why would they close inside Xbox only to develop that kind of stuff?
6380000	6381000	That's the weird part.
6381000	6382000	I don't know.
6382000	6386000	But I do think definitely something is in the works there.
6386000	6389000	Is that something that interests you, Loki?
6389000	6396000	Like I said, if it's at no additional cost to me, because I don't really have, I don't pay for cable TV right now.
6396000	6402000	But I do pay for Xbox Live Gold, so it'd be nice if that was included with it.
6402000	6405000	I'd probably watch some stuff on there.
6405000	6410000	Alright, going to a service called PlayCast.
6410000	6416000	PlayCast is an Israel-based company, and they're a cloud gaming service.
6416000	6418000	You can think similar to OnLive.
6418000	6425000	PlayCast is live in Portugal, France, and South Korea, which is weird because they're Israel-based, but they're in these other countries.
6425000	6430000	But they are supposed to be launching the service in the United States early next year.
6430000	6431000	It's a cloud service.
6431000	6439000	It streams through set-top boxes, tablets, smartphones, and PCs, anything that can run Android 4.0 and higher.
6439000	6444000	You do a subscription package that's tailored to a user.
6444000	6445000	Kind of interesting.
6445000	6452000	So like, in the service in France right now, there's a package that's more tailored to casual gamers, and then one that's tailored at the more hardcore.
6452000	6458000	So it's kind of like you would, I guess since we're talking about TVs and channels, you'd be buying, like Comcast, right?
6458000	6466000	When you sign up for their service, you can get like the sports channel package, or the, you know, entertainment channel package, or whatever, movie channels.
6466000	6470000	So kind of taking that idea to cloud gaming service.
6470000	6473000	Interesting. Interesting.
6473000	6481000	PlayCast is aiming towards what they call the mid-core market, a group that enjoys gaming but isn't going online in their favorite shooter every day.
6481000	6487000	So maybe not the type of people that listen to this show, but people that still enjoy gaming.
6488000	6498000	Apparently, if you use multiple devices, so like let's say you play on your TV through a PC, and then you can now use your phone or tablet as a controller.
6498000	6504000	PlayCast will instantly recognize the activity when you sign in with the auxiliary device.
6504000	6510000	You can create your own skins with the tablet or what have you, and customize the look and layout of the interface.
6510000	6525000	No word on exactly when this launches in the U.S. Of course, nothing on subscription prices, but it should be noted that PlayCast does have deals with Activision, Warner Brothers, Telltale, THQ, Codemasters, and these other countries.
6525000	6528000	They are also trying to get indies on board.
6528000	6535000	Consumer Electronics Show may bring us more information when that occurs January 8th through the 11th in Vegas.
6535000	6538000	Interesting.
6539000	6547000	I don't know, I'm not super big on these cloud gaming things, and I'm more of the type of gamer where it's like, I'll just buy the games I want to play.
6547000	6554000	But I can see the idea of, you know, go after the audience that maybe isn't as hardcore as I am.
6554000	6559000	I just don't want to put stuff that I'm paying for in somebody else's hands.
6559000	6568000	Yeah. It depends on the price though. If it were super cheap, it might be awesome. But I kind of doubt it's going to be that cheap.
6568000	6570000	Dark Sakura.
6570000	6574000	Well here is a big rumor. Now, have you ever heard of Idolmaster?
6574000	6576000	Yes I have.
6576000	6578000	Well, there is a...
6578000	6582000	I've been reading Japanese release dates for how long on this show? Yes, I've heard of Idolmaster.
6582000	6584000	Rob, it's called leading into a story. Hello.
6584000	6586000	Okay, my bad.
6586000	6596000	Well anyway, Namco Bandai registered two different trademarks in Europe. One of them is the Idolmaster and the other is Shiny Festa.
6596000	6601000	Which is one of the titles of a recent Idolmaster spinoff that's on the PSP.
6601000	6608000	So maybe we'll be getting Idolmaster. I mean, that looks like they're going to Europe first.
6608000	6613000	But I honestly think that if they did it there, they'd do it here. Don't you think?
6613000	6623000	And really what this is, the Idolmaster games, you basically manage a pop star's career. Sort of like a Tamagotchi game.
6623000	6629000	Shiny Festa is just a rhythm game that sort of follows after Project D.Va.
6629000	6634000	Do you have to clean up their poop too? Like Tamagotchi? No.
6634000	6637000	You have not taken a bath. Go bathe.
6637000	6639000	Okay.
6640000	6642000	Bathe is slower.
6642000	6644000	Rub.
6644000	6646000	And hence.
6646000	6650000	Anyway. So yeah, it could get localized.
6653000	6663000	Alrighty, well we'll see. I mean, I don't know. Trademark may just be preventing another company from coming in and releasing their own game called Idolmaster.
6663000	6671000	But I don't know. You would think there'd be an audience for it here. It's not going to be a huge thing like it is over there.
6671000	6679000	But there's certainly enough people that are into the Japanese culture alone that would want to check it out just because it's been so big over there.
6679000	6683000	It could be a cult game, I think is what they'd call it.
6683000	6688000	Who knows? I mean, we've seen other things happen. You know, games like that gain popularity.
6688000	6693000	I mean, would we have had Elite Beat agents otherwise?
6693000	6697000	That'd be neat. I don't know. Not my thing.
6697000	6703000	So this is kind of funny. We were talking a little bit about Killer Instinct and boob flashing, so that's awesome.
6703000	6709000	But this may stop another Killer Instinct game coming out.
6709000	6723000	Apparently Microsoft at least tried to renew the trademark of Killer Instinct, but it's been rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the basis of likelihood of confusion.
6723000	6730000	Apparently this has to do with a short-lived Fox show called Killer Instinct from 1995.
6730000	6737000	Because I know everybody that you talk about Killer Instinct thinks of the Fox show and not, I don't know, the fighting game series.
6737000	6738000	I've never heard of that show.
6738000	6741000	Somebody at the Trademark Office did.
6741000	6746000	Yeah, a really obscure person that probably, you know, that's my favorite show!
6746000	6751000	Same person probably also has episodes of Silk Stockings on tape.
6751000	6753000	Hey, Silk Stockings was awesome.
6753000	6757000	That was some good skinimax right there.
6757000	6761000	Anyways, and David Duchovny, you rock on.
6761000	6772000	Anyways, so basically said that, you know, they're probably going to be trying to, I guess, maybe appeal that or something.
6772000	6773000	I don't know.
6773000	6779000	Right now they said this happens to a lot of trademark applications and by no means is the final say on the application.
6779000	6784000	It just means that Microsoft has to provide more evidence to overcome their objection.
6784000	6787000	I would say, you know, ask the average person on three.
6787000	6792000	So, Killer Instinct, is that an arcade game or a show from 1995?
6792000	6794000	I'm going to be like, what?
6794000	6803000	I'm looking at some clips of Killer Instinct here on, I'm thinking this is the intro to the show or whatever, here on good old YouTube.
6803000	6805000	But yeah, this is the movie for dialogue.
6805000	6806000	Who doesn't star?
6806000	6807000	Marguerite Moreau.
6807000	6811000	I don't...
6811000	6813000	That's a lot of nothing.
6813000	6815000	I miss her too.
6815000	6821000	That's totally...
6821000	6823000	What? They're making a game based...
6823000	6824000	They don't even talk.
6824000	6827000	They're making a game based on my favorite show from 1995.
6827000	6828000	That's fantastic.
6828000	6829000	2005, actually.
6829000	6830000	Just so you know.
6830000	6832000	It said 1995.
6832000	6834000	No, it's 2005, that one that I'm looking at there.
6834000	6835000	It's 2005.
6835000	6836000	Oh really?
6836000	6837000	Yeah.
6837000	6838000	It's wrong.
6838000	6844000	But anyway, the game was 95, wasn't it?
6845000	6846000	Maybe.
6846000	6850000	Yeah, it was because I was in college in Alabama.
6850000	6851000	Anyway.
6851000	6853000	Kicking people's asses.
6853000	6857000	Anyway, it's not that they make games based off of shows.
6857000	6860000	Like CSI has games.
6860000	6863000	Survivor has games that aren't very good.
6863000	6866000	Wheel of Fortune, you just said, has a game coming out next week.
6866000	6869000	So surely Killer Instinct, a canceled show from 8 years ago.
6869000	6870000	It was 2005.
6870000	6872000	My mistake, not 1995.
6872000	6876000	Surely a canceled series from 7 years ago might have a game at some point.
6876000	6877000	So therefore...
6877000	6878000	I know.
6878000	6882000	Considering that it ran a whole, what, 13 episodes?
6882000	6883000	Wow.
6883000	6884000	People would totally...
6884000	6885000	No, I'm sorry.
6885000	6889000	Not even 13 episodes because 4 of those episodes were unaired.
6889000	6890000	So, uh...
6890000	6894000	According to GameGuru, sounds like your typical canceled Fox show.
6894000	6895000	Yes.
6895000	6896000	So 9 episodes.
6896000	6900000	Yeah, people are gonna totally confuse it for that piece of shit.
6900000	6902000	I'm sure, you know.
6902000	6909000	We would get a Wonder Falls video game before we would get a Killer Instinct video game based off the show.
6909000	6911000	I'm pretty sure this will be appealing.
6911000	6912000	Oh my god.
6912000	6913000	You know what this sounds like?
6913000	6918000	This sounds like a really crappy ripoff of Law and Order SVU.
6918000	6919000	It probably is.
6919000	6922000	They're part of the, get this, the Deviant Crimes Unit.
6922000	6924000	The DCU.
6926000	6927000	Yeah.
6927000	6929000	The DCU.
6929000	6931000	Totally not a ripoff of the SVU.
6931000	6937000	Well, it just goes to show that, you know, intellectual property laws in this country are kind of borked.
6937000	6938000	I mean, just...
6938000	6944000	I mean, technically, by the same logic, this show shouldn't have existed in the first place because of the game.
6944000	6947000	We were talking about Gunsmoke earlier.
6947000	6953000	That game was actually called Gun.Smoke because of the TV show.
6953000	6956000	But come on, everybody called it Gunsmoke.
6956000	6960000	And, you know, if you're talking in the context of a game, you know the game.
6960000	6963000	And if you're talking about television, classic TV, you know the show.
6963000	6966000	Like, you just, you just know.
6968000	6969000	Anyway.
6969000	6971000	Chief McBride was in it. He's awesome.
6971000	6972000	Who?
6972000	6973000	Chief McBride.
6973000	6974000	Oh.
6974000	6975000	The guy from Pushing Daisies.
6975000	6976000	Oh, I didn't know that.
6976000	6977000	It was like her mentor or whatever.
6977000	6978000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6978000	6980000	I didn't know that.
6980000	6983000	Oddly enough, some Mega Man news this week.
6983000	6987000	In light of the 25th anniversary, a couple things, believe it or not.
6987000	6991000	An 8-bit fan game had a little preview this week.
6991000	6993000	The Mega Man 25th anniversary.
6993000	6997000	This is a Canadian-based group, Team Reverbot.
6997000	7003000	But it's kind of a Voltron of various, you know, people here.
7003000	7007000	You have Julian Spillane from DHX Media or Silicon Knights.
7007000	7011000	Jason Kanam from Drinkbox Studios.
7011000	7015000	Ori Falconer and Daniel Ochoa from Vast Studios.
7015000	7017000	And Tim McLennan from Gameloft.
7017000	7020000	And then an independent artist, Jeff Kanam.
7020000	7024000	So this is, you know, again, it's kind of your basic NES throwback.
7024000	7026000	But with, like, all new bosses.
7026000	7028000	And I can play a little preview here.
7028000	7033000	You know, it's not all that different from Mega Man 9 and 10.
7033000	7035000	Because people seem to love their retro Mega Mans.
7036000	7038000	But, like, see, that guy actually shoots acid.
7038000	7041000	Which is in line with the theme stage here.
7041000	7043000	They even have all new bosses, right?
7043000	7047000	Like, there's actually Sledge Man, Bio Man, Tarot Man.
7047000	7052000	Kendo Man, Amp Man, Neon Man, Comet Man, and Totem Man.
7052000	7054000	Are all the new little bosses there.
7054000	7059000	If this little clip of the boss select screen is to be believed.
7059000	7061000	Interesting.
7061000	7070000	Actually, one of my friends in Japan just was posting something from Cap Community related to Mega Man.
7070000	7073000	I think it might be this other thing, probably, that I'm about to mention.
7073000	7075000	The Street Fighter X Mega Man.
7075000	7076000	Actually, yes.
7076000	7077000	Yes, that's what it is.
7077000	7080000	This was also something that was announced.
7080000	7081000	This is a little more official.
7081000	7084000	That other one was more of a, like, indie whatever.
7084000	7085000	This is a little more official.
7085000	7087000	Sort of, though.
7087000	7088000	The interesting thing about this.
7088000	7092000	This project, the Street Fighter X Mega Man, has been going on for a while.
7092000	7097000	And you can find the guy's YouTube channel and find these old concept videos from, like, three years ago.
7097000	7099000	So this has been being worked on for quite some time.
7099000	7102000	At some point, Capcom caught wind of it.
7102000	7108000	Because now Capcom is going to be the ones that are sending it out through their Unity blog.
7108000	7110000	The Capcom Unity blog.
7110000	7114000	And they're going to make it a free download on December 17th, 2012.
7114000	7120000	You know, for all the shit that Capcom gets for pissing off their fanbase over the past year,
7120000	7126000	this is a very interesting kind of band-aid to try and make it right with the community.
7126000	7129000	Because, you know, they see this indie project's going on.
7129000	7134000	And for all practical purposes, they have every right to shut the damn thing down.
7134000	7138000	But they've learned from watching what happens to other stuff when that goes on,
7138000	7140000	that this is going to get out there to the internet anyway.
7140000	7146000	So let's embrace it, give the guy a little guidance, and then, you know, give it out as a goodwill thing for free,
7146000	7148000	and end up giving the guy some exposure.
7148000	7150000	And it looks kind of neat.
7150000	7155000	It kind of does the whole parody of, like, Mega Man 2 here in the intro, but...
7158000	7160000	You can see, like, Ryu's stage.
7160000	7166000	It even does these interesting things where, like, the bosses have, because they're Street Fighter characters,
7166000	7168000	have, like, super meters.
7169000	7171000	The bosses have, like, super meters.
7171000	7176000	And once they fill up, it'll do, like, this little zoom in, and they do their super attack.
7176000	7177000	It's kind of funny.
7177000	7180000	I was watching some of the old concept videos online, so...
7180000	7184000	It's really neat that it came to life.
7184000	7189000	I kind of wonder if the guy got any help officially from Capcom, or what.
7190000	7191000	I don't know.
7192000	7194000	Well, you can get it free on December 17th.
7195000	7200000	By the way, the super fan behind this, Sonic, is the name he uses online.
7200000	7202000	Xiao Zong Hui.
7202000	7205000	He's a pro-competitive gamer, additionally.
7205000	7206000	Very cool.
7206000	7208000	Yay, I love this music.
7211000	7213000	Filled, uh, end of game music.
7213000	7216000	You know, um, Brentlefloss did lyrics to it.
7217000	7218000	Of course.
7219000	7220000	Anyway.
7220000	7221000	Anyway.
7221000	7225000	I love looking at the little chibi Street Fighter characters done up in Mega Man style.
7225000	7226000	I think that's awesome.
7227000	7228000	So.
7229000	7230000	Alright.
7231000	7234000	Going back to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,
7234000	7237000	GameGuru commented on that last story about Killer Instinct,
7237000	7243000	saying that the TV show came out right as Nintendo let that Killer Instinct trademark expire.
7243000	7247000	So, a small correction to me getting angry there a minute ago.
7247000	7248000	Good to know.
7249000	7253000	Dark Tetsuya in chat, talking on this Capcom Mega Man thing, says,
7253000	7257000	Yeah, the way Capcom handled that made me even more interested in checking it out.
7257000	7259000	I'm always down for more retro Mega Man.
7260000	7262000	Panaxium in chat says,
7262000	7265000	I'd play it if my reflexes weren't shit.
7265000	7266000	I'm getting old.
7267000	7268000	Yeah, you and me both.
7270000	7271000	Hopefully there's an easy mode.
7272000	7274000	Like Mega Man 2 style easy mode.
7275000	7276000	Alright, more news.
7276000	7277000	Dark Sakura.
7278000	7279000	News?
7279000	7280000	Oh, I'm sorry, we're to the mailbag.
7280000	7281000	Yeah!
7281000	7284000	Well, the news is, you all emailed us, and now we're gonna give you answers.
7284000	7285000	Fucking hell.
7285000	7287000	Mailbag at Orangelandrado.com.
7287000	7290000	Again, that's mailbag at Orangelandrado.com.
7290000	7295000	Dark Sakura's gonna dive in the mailbag head first, and pick out a few emails.
7295000	7300000	And, we were actually kind of, like, some weeks we get no emails whatsoever.
7300000	7302000	This week, we got a bunch.
7302000	7303000	All the emails.
7303000	7304000	All the emails.
7304000	7307000	So, Dark Sakura I think can only read some tonight, but she's gonna pick some and read them.
7307000	7308000	I'll go through them.
7308000	7309000	Goodie.
7309000	7310000	Surtur here.
7310000	7311000	What are the good games?
7311000	7312000	I don't know.
7312000	7313000	What are the good games?
7314000	7315000	Is that the whole sentence?
7315000	7316000	No.
7316000	7317000	Oh.
7317000	7318000	I like JRPGs.
7318000	7320000	I have Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, and Animal Crossing Wild World.
7320000	7322000	Which, I guess that isn't really a JRPG.
7322000	7325000	It's more of a kind of a sim, I guess.
7325000	7326000	What are other good games?
7326000	7328000	What do you think if the world ends with you?
7328000	7329000	Love the show.
7330000	7336000	I'm gonna guess he left out a sentence for the DS.
7337000	7340000	Because all those games he named are DS games, right?
7340000	7341000	I guess.
7341000	7342000	So, what are good DS games?
7342000	7344000	Dan likes Fire Emblem.
7344000	7347000	I mean, that's more of a strategy RPG.
7347000	7349000	Um, you know what game is surprisingly good?
7349000	7351000	Is the Cardhouse one.
7351000	7352000	The 30, the Clubhouse games.
7352000	7353000	That's what it is.
7353000	7355000	Clubhouse games is really good.
7355000	7358000	Maybe he's looking specifically for JRPGs.
7358000	7361000	I mean, you could play Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV.
7361000	7365000	Yeah, the Final Fantasy IV, III, and IV remakes are really good on DS.
7365000	7367000	By the way, side story.
7367000	7371000	Did you hear about Final Fantasy IV is getting its iOS release like Final Fantasy III did?
7371000	7372000	Good.
7372000	7374000	Final Fantasy IV is gonna be coming out for what?
7374000	7377000	Android and iPad and iPhone and all that stuff?
7377000	7378000	Android, meh.
7378000	7379000	Hey, I'm just saying.
7379000	7382000	It's coming out for all those systems before the end of the year, I think.
7382000	7383000	At least in Japan.
7385000	7386000	Next email.
7386000	7387000	Howdy, OLR.
7387000	7389000	It's your favorite catastrophic magi.
7389000	7391000	Unfortunately, this week I come bearing sad news.
7391000	7393000	Unlike every other time I've emailed recently
7393000	7397000	where I bitch about release dates for certain games, or lack thereof.
7397000	7401000	I'm sure the name will mean little to you, but earlier today, Sir Patrick Moore
7401000	7402000	I know who that is, by the way
7402000	7404000	passed away at the age of 89.
7404000	7409000	He was best known as an astronomer and the host of the long-running BBC TV show, The Sky at Night.
7409000	7411000	How does this relate to gaming, though?
7411000	7415000	Well, to gamers in the early 90s, he was also known as the Games Master
7415000	7419000	from a TV show of the same name, doling out tips and cheats every week
7419000	7421000	as well as challenges to contestants.
7421000	7425000	And then he links a video to it going forward.
7425000	7428000	The Games Master was the gaming TV show in the UK
7428000	7431000	in my far from humble opinion
7431000	7433000	and has never been bested, let alone equaled.
7433000	7434000	Goodbye, Games Master.
7436000	7437000	Total goodbye.
7437000	7441000	I never saw it, so I don't have that emotional attachment
7441000	7442000	but I can imagine.
7442000	7444000	I knew who he was as an astronomer.
7444000	7447000	Imagine the day when Mark Summers passes away.
7447000	7449000	We are all going to have a cry.
7449000	7452000	We're all going to throw green slime at you.
7452000	7454000	You know what's funny about Mark Summers?
7454000	7457000	He was pathologically...
7457000	7458000	Yeah, OCD.
7458000	7460000	Yeah, as far as things...
7460000	7462000	He hated dirty anything.
7462000	7464000	Hey, it was a job.
7464000	7466000	By the way, going back to the DS email,
7466000	7469000	Meteos is like my favorite DS game.
7469000	7471000	It's a puzzler and it's great.
7471000	7472000	I have my plea appeal.
7472000	7475000	It's not a JRPG, sorry, but Meteos is great.
7475000	7476000	I'm just saying it's a great game.
7476000	7478000	Since he left out a sentence in that email,
7478000	7480000	I'm just going to make up what it said.
7480000	7481000	Way to assume, Rob.
7481000	7483000	Yes, that's what I do.
7483000	7485000	Next up, hello, OLR crew.
7485000	7486000	This is Rom...
7486000	7487000	I'm going to butcher this.
7487000	7489000	Romaditya from Indonesia.
7489000	7490000	I think that's actually right.
7490000	7492000	This email is probably rather personal
7492000	7493000	because we are fellow gamers.
7493000	7495000	I think that's all right for me to ask your blessings.
7495000	7497000	Yes, I just got married.
7497000	7498000	Congrats.
7498000	7500000	I write this email soon after the party is over.
7500000	7502000	It's December the 9th.
7503000	7504000	Wait a minute.
7504000	7507000	When the marriage and the celebration of the party is over,
7507000	7509000	don't email your favorite podcast.
7509000	7511000	Get to the baby makings.
7513000	7514000	Consummate.
7516000	7519000	I'm going to assume he meant after all of that.
7519000	7522000	I know that marriage is such a common thing,
7522000	7524000	but for me, it is special.
7524000	7527000	What I mean is how it will make my gaming life special.
7527000	7528000	As a blind person like me,
7528000	7530000	it is very difficult to enjoy video games.
7530000	7532000	An 8-bit, 16-bit era were the only great memories
7532000	7533000	I could remember.
7533000	7535000	It is fortunate that my wife is also a gamer.
7535000	7538000	Even though she cannot play modern games very well,
7538000	7540000	she has the ability to translate what's on the screen
7540000	7541000	to my imagination.
7541000	7545000	So she agrees to help me re-enjoy my childhood memories.
7545000	7548000	Well, we decided to snatch an Atari 2600,
7548000	7550000	sorry, NES, Genesis, and SNES.
7550000	7552000	We will start by playing the simple games
7552000	7553000	like Galaxian or Pac-Man
7553000	7555000	and continue to Super Mario Brothers.
7555000	7558000	The way I will play the game is like this.
7558000	7560000	She will explain to me what to do,
7560000	7562000	and I will play it with my game and the controller.
7562000	7565000	For example, go left, don't go right, et cetera.
7565000	7568000	That way, for instance, I can still play Galaxian and so on.
7568000	7570000	Our best collaboration was when we finished Contra
7570000	7572000	with 30 lives code.
7572000	7573000	Well, that's all for now.
7573000	7574000	I hope this little story can inspire other people,
7574000	7576000	even with disabilities,
7576000	7578000	that they can still enjoy video games.
7578000	7582000	PS, we'll send you real-time video of how I play games.
7582000	7585000	PPS, this is a little pic for my marriage party.
7585000	7586000	Oh, I'm going to look at it.
7586000	7587000	I tried to look at it.
7587000	7588000	It was blocked on Facebook.
7588000	7590000	Yeah, it's blocked. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
7590000	7591000	We would love to enjoy your photo.
7591000	7593000	I think that story is so cute, though.
7593000	7594000	It is.
7594000	7596000	I mean, it's just, that's great.
7596000	7599000	I love that story. I do.
7599000	7603000	You and Dan, you told me you guys kind of do something similar, too,
7603000	7604000	in your relationship.
7604000	7609000	You're not facing a disability on the severity of blindness.
7609000	7611000	I faced motion sickness.
7611000	7613000	Well, yeah, that's a thing.
7613000	7616000	And your ergonomic thing with your hand.
7616000	7617000	Well, this was before my hand.
7617000	7618000	Okay.
7618000	7619000	But we would play Resident Evil 2,
7619000	7621000	and I'd welcome through the game with the strategy guide.
7621000	7624000	I mean, because I couldn't watch the screen all the time.
7624000	7625000	I'd get a little motion sick.
7625000	7628000	But it's something we would do together.
7628000	7630000	Okay, so moving forward.
7630000	7632000	Alan and I level characters in Warcraft together.
7632000	7633000	At least we did.
7633000	7635000	We did his first character.
7635000	7636000	What about our paladins?
7636000	7638000	Our paladin pals?
7638000	7640000	You and I aren't in a relationship.
7640000	7641000	No, I'm just kidding.
7641000	7643000	Our paladin pals were fun.
7643000	7644000	They can be friends.
7644000	7647000	Shane and I have leveled, like, at least three characters together.
7647000	7648000	It's a fun friend thing to do, too.
7648000	7650000	I need someone to finish leveling.
7650000	7652000	We just set a time, and we'll do it.
7652000	7655000	Help me level my stupid troll.
7655000	7656000	God, anyway.
7656000	7659000	Wait, Loki, do you and Nellie do any bonding thing?
7659000	7660000	Oh, please.
7660000	7662000	Come on.
7662000	7664000	You play the game, and she mocks you.
7664000	7667000	I wonder if she's asking in the night.
7667000	7671000	She's like, I don't know, like, what are you doing?
7671000	7674000	I'm hunting dingos.
7674000	7676000	Did they eat your baby?
7676000	7677000	I don't know.
7677000	7679000	They try to attack you, and then you skin them.
7679000	7682000	For the record, the challenge is still out there.
7682000	7684000	I will still play Minecraft if someone buys it for me.
7684000	7685000	Just saying.
7685000	7686000	Oh, it is haunted.
7686000	7688000	I was going to say, Christmas is coming up, but actually,
7688000	7690000	your holiday is going on right now, so oops.
7690000	7691000	I don't really care.
7691000	7692000	I know.
7692000	7693000	Hey, gang.
7693000	7694000	I just thought I would drop a line and say hey.
7694000	7695000	Hey.
7695000	7696000	Hey.
7696000	7698000	I watched the VGAs last night, and I must say I was very impressed
7698000	7700000	with the Game of the Year winner.
7700000	7702000	I just finished The Walking Dead about two weeks ago.
7702000	7707000	I found myself finishing an episode, or sitting in my office and pondering
7707000	7709000	whether the decisions I made were the right ones.
7709000	7711000	And that's when you know you've played a great game.
7711000	7715000	So good work, Telltale, for beating the Call of Duty's Borderlands
7715000	7717000	and all the other big-name AAA games.
7717000	7723000	It goes to show what you, I guess that means what you can do.
7723000	7726000	If you take an old-school remedy and modernize it a tad,
7726000	7729000	it can be video game gold.
7730000	7734000	I also wanted to ask Loki, knowing that you're a big GTA fan,
7734000	7737000	I was wondering if you ever played Sleeping Dogs.
7737000	7739000	Yes, I have played Sleeping Dogs.
7739000	7742000	I just started playing after picking it up on the Steam Thanksgiving sale,
7742000	7744000	and I'm pretty blown away.
7744000	7746000	I didn't have a very high expectation when I started it,
7746000	7749000	yet I am having a blast playing it.
7749000	7752000	So check it out if you haven't, and if you have, what did you think?
7752000	7756000	I thought it was pretty fun, although I got bored of it pretty quick.
7756000	7757000	Moved on to other things.
7757000	7761000	Now everyone stop what you're doing, and it should be Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E,
7761000	7765000	not Y-O-U-R. I will correct everyone who does this.
7765000	7766000	Grammar lessons with dark soccer.
7766000	7768000	You know what? It's stupid.
7768000	7771000	You learn this when you're in second grade. I mean, jeez.
7771000	7773000	Just blame autocorrect.
7773000	7778000	No, I'm not blaming autocorrect. I'm blaming people being lazy.
7778000	7780000	Where was I?
7780000	7783000	And if you haven't yet, go play The Walking Dead.
7783000	7786000	Oh, one more thing, after I complete Dogs That Aren't Awake,
7786000	7787000	I'm going to pick up Far Cry 3.
7787000	7790000	I wasn't a fan of 2, though. I have it on PS3 and Steam.
7790000	7793000	Just didn't find it appealing, so if any of you have played 2 or 3,
7793000	7794000	your thoughts are 4 for 4.
7794000	7796000	Keep up the good work, Travis.
7796000	7799000	That's a low-key question as far as Far Cry goes.
7799000	7800000	I didn't play Far Cry.
7800000	7802000	Walking Dead, I'm making it a point.
7802000	7804000	I will play that before the end of the year.
7804000	7806000	I'm not going to name a game of the year until I've at least played that,
7806000	7808000	because that's what everybody really seems to be into.
7808000	7811000	I'm making it a point to play more Mass Effect 3.
7811000	7813000	That's a pretty dull point.
7813000	7815000	You know what?
7815000	7816000	Yeah, go ahead.
7816000	7817000	I have a butt bite it.
7817000	7819000	Yes, low-key.
7819000	7821000	Far Cry 3 is awesome.
7821000	7822000	What about 2?
7822000	7828000	2, I didn't play, because the same reason why I didn't like Dead Rising,
7828000	7830000	you have malaria in the game.
7830000	7834000	So you have to constantly give yourself medication bullshit like that.
7834000	7835000	I don't like that.
7835000	7838000	Dead Rising 2 sucked, because of that crap.
7838000	7840000	And then I got Dead Rising 2 off the record, and I'm like,
7840000	7841000	Oh, sweet.
7841000	7845000	I'm not going to worry about the stupid having to get medicine for a stupid girl.
7845000	7849000	Oh, but then guess what, Frank West, he has the problem,
7849000	7851000	and he needs to get the fucking Zombrex for himself.
7851000	7854000	I'm like, gone.
7854000	7858000	Get rid of this game, because it's absolute shit.
7858000	7862000	So no, I do not enjoy games that you have malaria in.
7862000	7866000	But Far Cry 3 is awesome, because you do not have malaria in that.
7866000	7869000	Malaria-free games are awesome.
7870000	7871000	Exactly.
7871000	7874000	I should call in sick to work with malaria.
7874000	7879000	Sorry, Mosquito bit me, even though they're in larval stage right now.
7879000	7883000	Hey, guys, I'm a new listener, and I've got to say that you guys have one awesome show.
7883000	7884000	Thank you.
7884000	7885000	Well, thanks.
7885000	7886000	I've only been listening for a few weeks,
7886000	7889000	and I already feel like you guys are close friends that I've known forever.
7889000	7890000	Yay.
7890000	7896000	I've had very similar problems, and in my life, I've been having headaches.
7896000	7898000	Stripes just passed away, I'm sorry.
7898000	7899000	Aw.
7899000	7903000	And he always laid in my lap while I played Minecraft and Xbox,
7903000	7907000	but the point is that you have a great way to make the show feel like a great chat with friends
7907000	7909000	and keep up the good work.
7909000	7910000	That was our goal.
7910000	7911000	Yes.
7911000	7912000	Mission accomplished.
7912000	7913000	Yeah, exactly.
7913000	7914000	Mission accomplished.
7914000	7916000	Thank you for validating exactly what we sent out to do.
7916000	7923000	We wanted this podcast to be exactly what dinner after playing DDR at the arcade for a night was,
7923000	7929000	which was just sitting around talking some smack, having a good time, being bros, right, Jamie?
7929000	7930000	Yeah, brofist.
7930000	7931000	Brofist.
7931000	7933000	Dude, bros.
7933000	7939000	You know, every time you say that, though, I think of John's wow character, bro dude.
7939000	7943000	And I almost made, like, girl chick just to be funny.
7943000	7944000	You should have.
7944000	7946000	I should have, but no one's ever on that server.
7946000	7949000	But anyhow, thank you for validating what we're trying to do.
7949000	7950000	Yes.
7950000	7951000	Appreciate it.
7951000	7952000	Thanks.
7952000	7953000	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7953000	7960000	Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.
7960000	7962000	Fried bologna hole.
7962000	7963000	Is that what he called it?
7963000	7966000	Yeah.
7966000	7968000	Equating it to wow.
7968000	7972000	He completely missed the fact that while is always updating and adding new things to the game.
7972000	7980000	Do you think that anything resembling logic runs through his brain before he opens his fried bologna hole without comparing COD to other games?
7980000	7984000	Do you think they have a right or should charge for online play?
7984000	7985000	Fun fact.
7985000	7988000	I don't play either COD or wow as I hate them both.
7988000	7993000	Games do charge for online play.
7993000	7996000	Have you missed the online pass train?
7996000	7999000	Did you forget about that?
7999000	8000000	That was the thing.
8000000	8001000	What was he talking about?
8001000	8002000	Games charging for online play?
8002000	8003000	Apparently.
8003000	8004000	Read the first part of the email again.
8004000	8009000	Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.
8009000	8010000	Equating it to wow.
8010000	8013000	Well, I agree with that in one state.
8013000	8014000	Only one reason.
8014000	8019000	I think if they went throughout where, because a lot of people just buy it for the multiplayer.
8019000	8028000	In which case, if they sold it like killer, not killer instinct, but kill zone where they have the multiplayer version that you can buy for 15 bucks.
8028000	8031000	That portion of the game and that's all you get.
8031000	8033000	That might be worth it.
8034000	8039000	They could probably charge for multiplayer that way and sell maybe some more copies.
8039000	8050000	But as of right now, just because they're down by half a million copies, they sold over 7 million copies in the first month.
8050000	8052000	I don't say that's a failure of a game.
8052000	8060000	Yeah, okay, it's a little less than last year, but that is way better than 99% of the games sold right now.
8061000	8069000	I mean, they break their, the only reason they, I guess what, they didn't surpass the last year and the year before last records.
8069000	8071000	But come on, it's not gonna always increase.
8071000	8074000	8 million copies sold is just ridiculous.
8074000	8078000	You don't charge to play online when you're already charging to play online on the Xbox.
8078000	8080000	That's what Xbox Gold is.
8080000	8086000	I'm telling you, the minute I get double dipped for this shit, my Xbox is going for sale on eBay.
8086000	8087000	I'll even autograph it.
8087000	8088000	And hey, hey.
8088000	8089000	It's gone.
8089000	8092000	I don't want Xbox anymore if I start getting double dipped.
8092000	8096000	Hey, dipshit Michael Patcher, they already charge for playing Call of Duty Online.
8096000	8102000	There is a Hong Kong version, or Chinese or Hong Kong version of Call of Duty, Call of Duty Online, which is an MMO.
8102000	8105000	You charge to play online.
8105000	8107000	So, they've already done that.
8107000	8109000	Some comments from our chat room.
8109000	8112000	Raginator says, Patcher should just blow it out his fried bologna hole.
8112000	8118000	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, I think his mouth resembles more like Wanda's macaroni salad.
8121000	8123000	Oh, I see what you did there.
8123000	8124000	Alright, moving on.
8124000	8125000	Is that the right word?
8125000	8126000	Oh, no.
8126000	8127000	Is there more email?
8127000	8128000	No.
8128000	8129000	Yeah, there is, but there was more to that one.
8129000	8130000	Yes.
8130000	8133000	It says, good day citizens, serious turtle.
8133000	8134000	Oh.
8134000	8137000	And this is the last email that matters.
8137000	8139000	I'm kidding.
8139000	8151000	I'm sure achievements and trophies aren't such a big thing for you guys, but do you sort of wish Steam's achievements added up to an overall gamer score as with Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network, or even iOS slash Mac Game Center?
8151000	8154000	And that comes from Robert M.
8154000	8158000	It'd be okay, but it's not a deal breaker. I don't really care.
8158000	8161000	Like, are we talking like a unified achievement system?
8162000	8170000	That's kind of what the website Raptor tries to do a little bit. R.A.P.T.R. I think it's spelled.
8170000	8172000	That's kind of what they're trying to do with their site.
8172000	8176000	I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but they try to track all your gaming.
8176000	8179000	It didn't track my game progress in Grand Theft Auto 4.
8179000	8185000	Although I know it's retroactive, but like I played the fuck out of Grand Theft Auto 4 and it says I haven't played it at all.
8185000	8186000	Was that on 360 or?
8186000	8187000	Yes.
8187000	8190000	That's weird because it picks up all my Mass Effect activity and all that stuff.
8190000	8193000	Yeah, but stuff that you'd played before you joined Raptor or during?
8193000	8197000	Oh, I thought I picked up the befores. Not the hours. It doesn't pick up the hours from before.
8197000	8200000	Oh, it should have because I played the fuck out of that.
8200000	8202000	I'll tell you what, I hate the crap out of Origin.
8202000	8204000	I do too.
8204000	8210000	Which is why I always at least run my Mass Effect 3 through Steam so that it'll pop up through Steam and then Origin.
8210000	8214000	I'm not sure there's a way to really unify all that though, unfortunately.
8214000	8219000	Like, sorry to the emailer, but I think some people are trying to create online.
8219000	8225000	I've heard of a gaming social network, and I can't remember the name, that I think is aspiring to do something very similar as well.
8225000	8231000	So you have these different startups that are kind of competing to fill that void of, you know, your universal gaming badge.
8231000	8234000	But nobody's really cracked into the mainstream yet.
8234000	8239000	I mean, Raptor's probably the biggest one I can think of, but they're not a Twitter, they're not a Facebook yet.
8239000	8244000	They're still very, very niche, and I bet a lot of gamers still haven't heard of them.
8245000	8251000	Hitstun in chat says, Raptor's pretty nice, but there's plenty of stuff it doesn't track, like Minecraft with third-party launchers.
8251000	8255000	And it tries to make you use their shitty web browser, but the stats are nice.
8255000	8257000	So, there you have it.
8257000	8259000	Right, that's it.
8259000	8264000	That's it, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you wish to send us emails in the future.
8266000	8268000	This is the part of the show where we get angsty.
8274000	8276000	All this is bad.
8276000	8278000	Here is justice.
8278000	8280000	Here is punishment.
8280000	8282000	Here.
8282000	8284000	This is fucked up.
8286000	8288000	I actually can't really say anything about it.
8288000	8293000	So, it's a blanket F you to a situation that I really can't do much about right now.
8293000	8295000	That's it.
8295000	8297000	Loki.
8297000	8299000	I figured it would be so expensive.
8299000	8308000	I'm actually looking at this real quickly going through Newegg to see if I could create one of those Alienware PCs that they have for cheaper than obviously they offer them.
8308000	8310000	And yeah, you probably can.
8310000	8312000	But it's still expensive.
8313000	8315000	Um, F you to latkes.
8315000	8317000	Do you know how fat you've made me tonight?
8317000	8318000	No.
8318000	8321000	Do you know how many hours on the treadmill I won't spend burning this off?
8321000	8323000	No.
8323000	8325000	Rob, potassium.
8325000	8327000	I eat bananas.
8327000	8329000	Actually, potatoes have more potassium.
8329000	8331000	Really?
8331000	8333000	I'm gonna find it for you.
8333000	8335000	You gonna find me a study?
8335000	8337000	A scientific study?
8337000	8345000	Alright, let's do a couple more news stories and then we'll go to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8345000	8348000	But not just yet, we do have a couple more stories for you guys.
8348000	8349000	Loki.
8349000	8358000	Yes, because you know Hitman has had its share of really bad marketing ideas and well, there's yet another one.
8358000	8366000	Apparently they had a Facebook promotion where you can do a hire Hitman app for Facebook.
8366000	8376000	What it basically did was it allowed you to create these hits on different people and of course, you know, some of the reasons I guess.
8376000	8381000	Target identified by, and then there's a drop down box, reason for target elimination.
8381000	8391000	So like some of the target identified by things are her small tits or her muffin top or her hairy legs or her ginger hair and that kind of stuff.
8391000	8393000	Some ridiculous things.
8393000	8396000	Apparently people took offense to that.
8396000	8398000	Oh, you think?
8398000	8399000	Yeah.
8399000	8401000	Imagine that, Loki.
8402000	8406000	I can't possibly imagine how this could have possibly been offensive.
8406000	8410000	Putting a hit out on your friend because they have hairy legs and small tits.
8410000	8416000	I can't, I mean, the madness of it all.
8416000	8425000	And I guess they also had, like I said, not only when you fill that thing out, I guess if your friend receives the app or whatever,
8425000	8432000	it says they were going to not only receive these death threats, but they were going to witness their full on hits,
8432000	8439000	including I guess their friend going through the process, flash pictures of their profile or something like that before their eyes, before they were killed.
8439000	8445000	And then I guess when they are killed, it tells the reason why.
8445000	8453000	You know, because Bob thought that your tits were small and that you were cheating on your partner or some garbage like that.
8453000	8462000	And I guess, yeah, I guess people were kind of offended by that.
8462000	8465000	And of course, we're sorry for any offense caused by this.
8465000	8472000	Like, where was the common sense when this was going through the testing process?
8472000	8475000	Like, multiple people must have worked on this project.
8475000	8481000	Where was the, I don't know, validation by a human being?
8481000	8489000	Like, was that just skipped? What happened there? How out of touch was this marketing department for real?
8489000	8496000	Dark Sakura, imagine you woke up this week and imagine you go on Facebook and you check Facebook and you say,
8496000	8504000	hey, and you see a little thing that says Rob Roberts has put out a hit on you because you're a bitch and you smell.
8504000	8506000	How would you have responded to that?
8506000	8509000	I'm going to cut that hooker.
8509000	8510000	Cut that bitch.
8510000	8513000	Dark Sakura apparently approved the app, ladies and gentlemen.
8513000	8516000	No, I don't. No, I don't.
8516000	8517000	He would have been like...
8517000	8520000	I would cut a bitch though.
8520000	8528000	You would have written a ten page paragraph about what bullshit that was as your status update.
8528000	8531000	No, I wouldn't.
8531000	8535000	I just ask people to explain certain social conventions that I find baffling.
8536000	8544000	SSJ100Matt says, the fact that Square Enix dropped this so quickly tells me it was mostly behind their ad agency.
8544000	8547000	Yeah, I would think so.
8547000	8555000	Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, I'm guessing the team involved had zero women on it or the few women they had were shut out or ignored.
8555000	8556000	Now, to be fair...
8556000	8558000	You mean like DC Comics?
8559000	8564000	He's probably right, but just because I have to ask this because I want to know the full story.
8564000	8569000	Could I put a hit out on a man for having small tits and hairy legs?
8569000	8574000	I think you could. I don't know if they would have those options. Maybe they might, you know...
8574000	8576000	You do have rather small boobs, Rob.
8576000	8582000	Maybe they would sort them out because of, you know, by gender and they might have different things.
8582000	8585000	But, you know, a small penis.
8585000	8586000	Okay, right.
8586000	8587000	Maybe. I don't know.
8588000	8589000	Still not smart.
8589000	8590000	They probably...
8590000	8591000	Don't mishear me.
8591000	8593000	Because of his large penis.
8593000	8595000	But I'm just, you know...
8595000	8597000	I put out a hit on him because his penis is too large.
8600000	8603000	Do you know her? Her dick is so little. No.
8604000	8608000	Actually, I don't think it's even that necessarily it had zero women on it.
8608000	8616000	It had zero people that, like, actually are in the demographic they're trying to target.
8616000	8619000	I think that's the biggest problem with things like this.
8619000	8628000	Is it's like, you know, like, you can just imagine all these old fuddy duddies sitting in a room talking about, you know, what's cool and what's hip and what the youngsters are into.
8628000	8630000	I'm hip. I'm cool.
8630000	8632000	Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
8632000	8638000	And it's like, if you had shown this to anybody in that, like, you would have been told.
8638000	8640000	It's stupid.
8642000	8643000	It's dumb.
8643000	8645000	Quite. Rob, quite.
8645000	8647000	Alright. Moving on.
8647000	8650000	Well, good on them shutting it down as fast as they did.
8650000	8652000	But lesson learned.
8652000	8655000	Screen that shit before it goes live.
8655000	8657000	Just saying.
8659000	8661000	This is interesting.
8661000	8665000	Have you ever heard of a VRC6 cartridge back in the days?
8665000	8666000	NES.
8666000	8669000	VRC Memory Management Controller chip.
8669000	8673000	It was something that Konami had on Famicom cartridges.
8673000	8678000	It would add three extra sound channels allowing for richer audio.
8678000	8680000	Here's an example.
8680000	8684000	Here's what Castlevania 3 sounds like in the U.S. in the NES.
8686000	8688000	We all know that one, right?
8688000	8693000	But here's what it sounded like on the Famicom because of the three extra sound channels.
8693000	8695000	I love this version too.
8701000	8702000	Very different, huh?
8702000	8704000	You should hear how The Legend of Zelda sounds.
8704000	8709000	Did you know how many fucking games were dumbed down with the sound because of it?
8709000	8711000	This is really cool.
8711000	8713000	A chiptune artist named RussJet1.
8713000	8716000	We've had his stuff on the station before. I know this guy.
8716000	8722000	He has used the VR6 chip to remake the Mega Man 3 soundtrack.
8722000	8725000	Now, Mega Man 3 was already fucking awesome, right?
8725000	8728000	Okay, so here's an example.
8728000	8731000	Here's Magnet Man's original theme.
8731000	8733000	This is the original.
8740000	8742000	A good song. Remember that?
8742000	8746000	Here is RussJet1's VR6 version.
8762000	8764000	So it's a little bit remixed too.
8764000	8767000	He didn't just take the original and overlay it.
8767000	8769000	He just completely kind of redid it.
8769000	8771000	So that's really cool.
8771000	8777000	He actually played through Mega Man 3 with the audio silenced,
8777000	8780000	laid his tunes on top of the game footage,
8780000	8784000	and then when he gets to Wily's Castle, it even goes through.
8784000	8787000	So it's awesome, this whole little video that's out there.
8787000	8789000	Protoman's theme, everything is there.
8789000	8793000	So you can check that out at RussJet1.bandcamp.com,
8793000	8795000	where he distributes a lot of his stuff.
8795000	8798000	Very cool. Very cool.
8798000	8802000	Yeah, so, I mean, gosh, I want to go back and replay
8802000	8805000	all these old games on a Famicom emulator
8805000	8807000	just to hear how awesome the sounds were.
8807000	8809000	You really should hear the differences between
8809000	8811000	the different versions of The Legend of Zelda.
8811000	8814000	It really is kind of night and day.
8814000	8817000	Well, let me open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8817000	8820000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8820000	8822000	And while we wait for some calls,
8822000	8824000	let me see if I can bring that up here.
8824000	8826000	I think that you can find it.
8826000	8828000	I mean, it's really just the fact that
8828000	8830000	there was a little bit different instrumentalization
8830000	8834000	on the two different ones, so...
8834000	8835000	Let's see.
8835000	8836000	You should look for the...
8839000	8840000	The disc version.
8840000	8842000	Yeah, this is the disc version.
8843000	8844000	Hmm.
8844000	8846000	It's going through the title screen and all that stuff.
8846000	8847000	Yeah.
8850000	8851000	Well, some of this sounds normal.
8851000	8852000	Oh, yeah.
8852000	8854000	I guess we have to get to, like, the dungeon.
8854000	8856000	Let me fast forward a little bit.
8856000	8857000	But it's a lot richer.
8857000	8860000	Oh, yeah, you can even hear an extra little ding.
8860000	8863000	Let me see if we can get to the dungeon.
8863000	8864000	Here we go.
8864000	8865000	You hear the difference in the start?
8865000	8866000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8866000	8867000	You hear the difference in the start?
8867000	8868000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8872000	8873000	So it's mostly...
8873000	8875000	No, it's in the sound effects.
8875000	8876000	Oh, yeah, you can hear it in that.
8876000	8880000	But actually, if it had allowed to play through the intro,
8880000	8881000	it would have sounded different.
8881000	8882000	Let me go to the phones,
8882000	8883000	because we're getting some calls.
8883000	8884000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8884000	8885000	Who's this?
8885000	8887000	Hi, it's Panaxium.
8887000	8888000	Hey, another video caller.
8888000	8890000	What's up, Panaxium?
8890000	8891000	Hey.
8891000	8893000	Hi, you can't see me, but I'm waving.
8893000	8895000	What's up?
8895000	8897000	Rob, you're a special, special person.
8897000	8898000	I know, I know.
8898000	8899000	What's on your mind, buddy?
8899000	8903000	I was actually calling to see if you guys had heard of Starbound.
8903000	8904000	Starbound.
8904000	8905000	Is this like...
8905000	8908000	This has to be like an Earthbound fan sequel, right?
8908000	8911000	Actually, no, it's the spiritual successor to Terraria.
8911000	8912000	Really?
8912000	8913000	Okay.
8913000	8914000	No, tell me about it.
8914000	8915000	Tell me more.
8915000	8918000	It's actually going to be very sci-fi.
8918000	8920000	So you're going to be able to visit other planets and stuff,
8920000	8922000	and each planet's going to have different ecosystems
8922000	8924000	and monsters and things like that.
8924000	8926000	So far, it looks like it's going to be really cool.
8926000	8927000	I love Terraria.
8927000	8929000	I don't know if you guys had a chance to try it.
8929000	8930000	I have tried it.
8930000	8932000	I prefer Minecraft, I've got to say.
8932000	8936000	Terraria really did not tell me what to do.
8936000	8938000	I tried to get into it and could not.
8938000	8941000	Yeah, but I went back and played it after I enjoyed Minecraft,
8941000	8943000	and I was like, all right, I see why people get into this,
8943000	8947000	because it's like if Minecraft were on the Super Nintendo,
8947000	8949000	this is what it would be.
8949000	8951000	And that was pretty cool.
8951000	8952000	Yeah, pretty much.
8952000	8954000	And the new ones, they have the graphics,
8954000	8957000	they have the variety of things you can get and do
8957000	8961000	and different races you can play as, and it seems really cool.
8961000	8964000	Is it by the same people who did the original Terraria?
8964000	8965000	Yeah, it's the same group.
8965000	8967000	They've expanded it, though.
8967000	8968000	There's more people working on it.
8968000	8970000	Oh, nice.
8970000	8972000	Well, I'm glad the first game worked out so well for them
8972000	8974000	that they can actually do a sequel.
8974000	8976000	That's got to be good.
8976000	8978000	And it actually led me to a question,
8978000	8980000	and I thought I'd kind of pass it along to you guys
8980000	8981000	to get your opinion.
8982000	8986000	Do you think that this will ever move from being an indie-type game
8986000	8990000	with Minecraft and Terraria towards being a big project?
8991000	8994000	Anything's possible in this day and age.
8994000	8999000	You see things like the Gianna Sisters game
8999000	9001000	started as a project greenlight thing,
9001000	9003000	and now it's an Xbox Live Arcade.
9003000	9006000	I suppose a lot of it is, what do the developers want?
9006000	9009000	What are they kind of willing to do?
9009000	9013000	Sometimes people don't really want to play by the rules
9013000	9016000	that systems like Xbox Live and so forth might set out.
9016000	9018000	I think we've all heard the stories before
9018000	9020000	about the patching on Xbox Live
9020000	9022000	and how it costs all this money
9022000	9024000	if you want to do a patch beyond the first one,
9024000	9026000	and it's really turned some people off.
9026000	9028000	They won't patch Fez because of it, right?
9028000	9031000	That's a whole big thing behind it.
9031000	9034000	Now, Nintendo's changing that up a little bit.
9034000	9036000	We reported on that a couple weeks ago.
9036000	9038000	We have yet to see the impact of that, if it works,
9038000	9042000	but Nintendo's really trying to woo the indies towards Wii U
9042000	9044000	by not charging a fee for any of that stuff,
9044000	9049000	so it could be very interesting to see where they'll end up.
9049000	9052000	I guess at the end of the day, it just depends.
9052000	9055000	Do they think they can create the gaming experience
9055000	9057000	they want on those systems?
9057000	9059000	I don't know.
9059000	9064000	I seem to remember Terraria made pretty good use of the keyboard,
9064000	9069000	so maybe they're worried about putting the controller into that environment.
9069000	9071000	I don't know.
9071000	9074000	It's a risk worth taking,
9074000	9082000	but they have to decide if financially it's one that they'll get the downloads from.
9082000	9085000	But if the community demands it, you never know what might happen.
9085000	9087000	Yeah, exactly.
9087000	9090000	Those cooperative collaboration games
9090000	9092000	where you're building and exploring together,
9092000	9094000	those are my kind of game. I always liked them,
9094000	9097000	so I'm hoping that they get more exposure and more games made in that style.
9097000	9101000	That's the type of stuff that seems to really do well on Xbox Live indie games, too,
9101000	9103000	is all the Minecraft clones.
9103000	9105000	You look at the top games,
9105000	9108000	half of them are Minecraft clones. It's crazy.
9108000	9110000	Yeah.
9110000	9115000	Well, that's what I had called about and just wanted to call in and say hi.
9115000	9121000	Well, hello, and thank you for alerting us to a game we ought to be keeping our eyes on.
9121000	9124000	Yeah, I'll go ahead and post the link to their website in the chat.
9124000	9125000	Awesome.
9125000	9126000	All right.
9126000	9129000	Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy. Take care.
9129000	9131000	Panaxium, everybody, on our Skype line.
9131000	9139000	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9139000	9142000	I'm looking up Link to the Past right now.
9142000	9144000	Oh, wait. No, Link to the Past is the Super Nintendo one.
9144000	9145000	That would have been different.
9145000	9147000	What was the Adventures of Link?
9147000	9150000	It was the second game of Link.
9150000	9152000	Live Radio, boys and girls.
9152000	9153000	Here we go.
9153000	9155000	The Adventure of Link title.
9155000	9156000	Yeah.
9156000	9158000	Oh, wow. Even the little...
9158000	9159000	That does...
9159000	9160000	That sounds different, too.
9170000	9174000	See, I always knew the Famicom game sounded different.
9174000	9179000	I knew about this chip and all that stuff, you know, just keeping my finger on the gaming community pulse
9179000	9180000	as long as I have been.
9180000	9181000	You knew about this stuff.
9181000	9183000	I never really sat down and took the time to listen to some of this stuff.
9183000	9184000	That's awesome.
9187000	9188000	Pass order.
9192000	9193000	That's awesome.
9193000	9195000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9195000	9197000	It's the one and only Rama.
9197000	9199000	Hey, Rama. What's up, buddy?
9199000	9203000	I just want you to know, for the first time in the history of calling this show,
9203000	9206000	you guys have derailed me from what I wanted to talk about.
9206000	9207000	Uh-oh.
9207000	9208000	What?
9209000	9210000	RushJet1.
9210000	9212000	After hearing that music, I went straight to the Googles.
9214000	9215000	It's pretty awesome, isn't it?
9216000	9219000	You have no idea, especially with the fact I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
9219000	9221000	I'll be filling this up on my phone tonight.
9222000	9223000	He's good, too.
9223000	9224000	He's got a lot of stuff.
9224000	9229000	There's a track that I think we have in rotation on VoG, actually.
9229000	9233000	It was on the old Orange, because I went through the old OrangeLoungeRadio files
9233000	9235000	and we were putting together VoG's initial playlist.
9235000	9240000	Obviously, we want a mixture of geek stuff as well as the video game stuff in there.
9240000	9242000	But we actually had...
9242000	9245000	Oh, shit. Now that I'm talking about it, of course, I can't find it.
9245000	9248000	But we actually had in there a track that was called...
9248000	9251000	I think it was Konomized, was the name of the song.
9251000	9253000	I'm going to see if I can find it while we're talking here.
9253000	9255000	I'll play a little clip of it, but it was awesome.
9255000	9259000	By the way, Jason also suggested finding the Hyrule Castle Famicom version from Zelda 2.
9260000	9262000	Oh, I've heard that one. It is phenomenal.
9262000	9264000	Yeah. That's pretty amazing.
9264000	9268000	I don't even like Zelda 2 that much, but I love the music in it.
9268000	9273000	Actually, Zelda 2 is my favorite one, because believe it or not, that was the first Zelda game I ever played.
9273000	9274000	Wow.
9274000	9279000	The first one for me was the first one, but I just didn't like the side-scrolling aspect.
9279000	9284000	I mean, I'm not going to whine because it was hard, because the game was really freaking hard.
9284000	9287000	But it was just the style. It just didn't seem quite right.
9287000	9290000	And it also looked like Link was stabbing people with his cock.
9291000	9293000	The downward thrust.
9294000	9295000	Come on.
9296000	9299000	I was in puberty. I knew what those were.
9300000	9301000	Just a second.
9301000	9305000	So what else did you call in to talk about tonight? Just Rush Jett or...?
9305000	9309000	No, no. I was out earlier, so I missed half the show. I apologize. I apologize.
9309000	9312000	Shame on you. It's fine. It happens.
9312000	9316000	I just want two quick things. Did you hear about what's happening to G4?
9317000	9319000	The Esquire thing? Yeah.
9320000	9325000	You might have missed it when we were talking about it, but another podcast, The Nerdist with Chris Hardwick,
9325000	9331000	Alan informed me that they were talking about that it's actually like Brovo, is what the network's basically going to be.
9331000	9336000	And we were coming up with a joke, The Real Dude Bros of Orange County might be a show.
9336000	9339000	Sounds like Hipster Spike TV.
9342000	9346000	Yes. What do you think the Esquire channel will end up being?
9347000	9353000	I don't know. I don't think I want to know. It'll be funny nonetheless to see the end results.
9353000	9355000	Here's the other question. Do you care?
9356000	9357000	No, not really.
9358000	9360000	Here's that song, by the way, that's in rotation on VOG. I found it.
9360000	9376000	It's using a lot of the sound effects you hear from Konami cartridges and kind of their sound palettes, so it's pretty awesome.
9376000	9381000	Anyhow, that's Konamiized by Rush Jet, and I'm sure that's on his bandcamp site as well.
9382000	9384000	Good stuff, huh, Rama?
9384000	9389000	Oh yeah, and I found he has two albums on 8bitpeoples.com as well, so I'm definitely grabbing those.
9389000	9393000	There you go, there you go. Alright, well, anything else on your mind tonight before I let you go, buddy?
9394000	9396000	Yes. Have you heard of a convention called MagFest?
9398000	9400000	I've heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is.
9401000	9404000	Is this about Mag the Game on Sony or no?
9405000	9408000	No, it's a four-day gaming convention.
9408000	9409000	Oh, okay.
9409000	9413000	All types of video games. And I'm checking the guest list. They have some interesting people here.
9414000	9419000	Let's just say there's somebody here where we may have to ship Dark Soccer over to DC for it.
9419000	9420000	Uh-oh.
9420000	9422000	Who's gonna pay for the ticket?
9423000	9425000	I have my ways.
9426000	9429000	Okay, what's the talent that's gonna be there?
9429000	9434000	Well, a couple of names here we've heard on the show, like John St. John and Eric Ruth Games.
9434000	9437000	Yes, I definitely know John St. John, yep, yep.
9437000	9444000	And since you mentioned Castlevania earlier, Kinuyo Yamashita, a composer for Castlevania.
9445000	9446000	Ooh.
9446000	9447000	Wow.
9447000	9448000	Nice.
9448000	9450000	And, um, can I get a drumroll, please?
9453000	9454000	Yuzo Koshiro.
9454000	9455000	Nice!
9455000	9456000	Ooh.
9457000	9460000	I need to go. I'm a huge Yuzo Koshiro fan. That's awesome.
9461000	9463000	Well, we have one spot left in our room.
9464000	9465000	When is it?
9466000	9468000	First weekend of January.
9468000	9471000	Oh, that's like really soon. Oh my God.
9472000	9479000	I can't do anything that weekend, because that's when my coworker is already out, so I can't take the same time off.
9479000	9486000	Well, that's okay, because my crew, we're gonna take care of you guys at MAGFest, so we are in line for press.
9486000	9492000	Awesome. SSG100Matt says MAGFest is amazing. Brental Floss has been there the last few years.
9492000	9497000	Yes, and also they also call this con drink fest. I don't think I have to explain why.
9498000	9499000	Can't imagine why.
9500000	9503000	Well, there's a reason why they're walking around with styrofoam containers.
9503000	9511000	Hopefully I make it out there for PAX East. We'll see. I'm still trying. I have to wait for them to open up the media registration to see if, you know, we can make that work.
9511000	9521000	Well, my entire staff, we got our badges in advance, then we're gonna apply for press, and if we get pressed, then we'll just pass the badges on to somebody else or whoever.
9521000	9523000	There you go. There you go. Paying it forward.
9524000	9525000	Got that shit right.
9525000	9528000	Alright. Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls.
9528000	9529000	Take care, man.
9529000	9530000	Alright, take care, buddy. Have fun at MAGFest.
9530000	9531000	Will do.
9531000	9540000	Yep. Yeah, and I've basically been told that basically, yes, I am being forced at gunpoint to go to Dragon Con next year, so that's like a thing.
9540000	9544000	I've been told if you want to go to PAX, you better go to PAX East, because you ain't going to PAX Prime.
9545000	9547000	Alright. Yes, sir.
9548000	9552000	1877 GameOLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9552000	9559000	So, yeah, if you're in the southeast part of the country, you might want to make plans on Dragon Con, because there's like a lot of vog stuff going on at Dragon Con next year.
9559000	9560000	That's all I can really say.
9563000	9566000	OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, 1877 GameOLR.
9566000	9570000	Loki, I can go to you for last minute stories, but I can also do the Twitter topics.
9570000	9572000	I've got last minute stories if you want them.
9572000	9573000	Yeah, go for it.
9573000	9579000	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to the PlayStation Network probably next week.
9579000	9589000	It's dated for December 12th in Hong Kong, I believe. It's the English version there.
9589000	9598000	However, it has been also confirmed on the Drop, which is the PlayStation Blog's little bit where they talk about stuff that's coming out.
9598000	9602000	And next week, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas PS2 Classic.
9602000	9605000	So, fantastic that that's going to be coming out.
9605000	9613000	Also, there's been some Linux system requirements popping up on Steam for some games that haven't really been announced yet.
9613000	9623000	Serious Sam BFE's Linux requirements have been on there, and also some more of the, I guess, a few Greenlight games as well.
9623000	9631000	So, perhaps more evidence that they're really working towards that Steam version, or the Linux version of Steam for the Steam Box.
9631000	9637000	Be interesting. And then finally, the next Assassin's Creed is going to be in Brazil.
9637000	9648000	And this has been actually confirmed, I guess GameSpot says they verified the translation that the next chapter is supposed to be held in Brazil.
9648000	9651000	And this was coming from Ubisoft Brazil.
9651000	9653000	Imagine that.
9653000	9655000	Yes, that their next game is going to be there.
9656000	9661000	Obviously it'd be perfect for them to be working on it in some, you know, capacity.
9661000	9663000	That's it.
9663000	9665000	Going to some Twitter topics.
9665000	9667000	Oh, sorry. One last thing real quick.
9667000	9670000	Again, 1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype.
9670000	9680000	As I mentioned on my Twitter this week, I am very disappointed to announce that Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable has been cancelled in the US.
9681000	9684000	At least the retail release of it.
9684000	9688000	Now, that doesn't rule out that they could be doing a digital only version, which would make sense.
9688000	9696000	Because the Vita not doing so great, and a game that's kind of niched like Earth Defense Force may not sell very well as far as releasing it retail.
9696000	9703000	DJ Max Technica just came out on Vita this week, and it's apparently easier to get on the digital store than it is to get a physical copy.
9703000	9708000	I don't, yeah. So, that might be why.
9708000	9710000	So, let's go to the phones, because you do have a call coming in.
9710000	9712000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9714000	9716000	Hey, this is Raginator.
9716000	9718000	Hey, Raginator. And look, another video.
9718000	9722000	I like that the callers are actually listening to the request for more video.
9722000	9724000	What's up, buddy?
9724000	9726000	No, not too much.
9726000	9730000	I just have a couple of questions for you.
9730000	9732000	Sure.
9732000	9740000	First off, I know that ROMs are kind of a legal gray area.
9740000	9752000	But in terms of the emulators, assuming that you have, let's say, Final Fantasy XII for the PS2, you actually own the game.
9752000	9756000	Are you allowed to use an emulator to play the game?
9756000	9764000	You're right. It's a gray area. And I'm gonna say up front, I am not a lawyer, so do not take legal advice from me.
9764000	9770000	But my understanding is, you are entitled to make your own backup copy of a game that you own.
9770000	9778000	So, if you make your own backup copy, and you use an emulator to play that backup copy, I believe you're okay.
9778000	9784000	However, if you downloaded said copy from the internet, technically that's where you're in the legal gray area.
9784000	9790000	Are you gonna end up on Judge Judy and spend time behind bars because of it? Probably not. Probably not.
9790000	9800000	But are you being 100% legal? You're a law-abiding citizen by every step of the way? Probably not.
9800000	9808000	But I think ethically, if you wanna ask the ethical question, if you own the game, then yes.
9808000	9814000	You should be able to have the emulator and do whatever crazy things you wanna do with the hacking and the so forth.
9814000	9820000	You paid your money to support the developers and get the game and so forth. Have at you. Do what you want with it.
9820000	9822000	I think ethically, you're okay.
9822000	9828000	Yeah. I mean, I brought it up because I still have a lot of games on disk.
9828000	9833000	I got a way around. Luckily, the things back in August did not scale everything.
9834000	9837000	I still got my Final Fantasy trial and I've been dying to beat the game.
9837000	9842000	That is the GameStop collector's edition too. I can even tell because it's the same one I have.
9842000	9844000	The tin box? Yeah, I have that one too.
9844000	9847000	You can tell. That's what video allows me to do.
9847000	9849000	I've played it once.
9849000	9851000	It's a good game. It really is.
9851000	9860000	BlackWolf wanted to add to this conversation. He says it all depends on if you had to circumvent copy protection to make that ROM playable on the emulator.
9860000	9869000	That's a DMCA violation. But again, legally, yeah, but ethically, I think you're okay.
9869000	9876000	Yeah, I just kind of figured if there was something out there that a program did, well, it mimicked the hardware.
9876000	9885000	If I actually popped the disk into my computer's DVD drive, the original disk, basically turned my computer into a PS2,
9886000	9892000	I wasn't totally sure if it would be legal or not, so I don't want to get myself into trouble.
9892000	9895000	I think you'll be fine. Nobody listens to this show. That's the good news.
9895000	9903000	On the PlayStation 2, didn't you have that hard drive backup thing where you could load all the games to the drive and play them off the drive and it worked fine?
9903000	9904000	Yeah, it was...
9904000	9907000	No, not you. I'm sorry. That was Loki, not you, Reginator. Sorry.
9907000	9909000	Yeah, there was the HD loader that they had.
9909000	9913000	Yeah, the HD loader. And, you know, if it's games you own, that's fine.
9913000	9919000	But if you're renting games, dumping them and then shipping them back, that's ethically shame, shame, slap on the wrist.
9919000	9920000	Yeah.
9920000	9922000	So, anyway, sorry, Reginator.
9922000	9932000	Yeah, well, I don't see, at least with what you were just talking about, you know, even then, how many games are going to put onto that PS2 hard drive?
9933000	9946000	It was only a 60 gigabyte hard drive, or scratch it out, 40 gigabytes, and the average PS2 game was about, let's say, no more than 8 gigs, so...
9946000	9954000	That's where you hack things to get the 500 gig hard drive to work, which you can also do on the Wii.
9955000	9970000	Now, one thing I kind of touched on over the past month or two is that now that I don't have any consoles anymore, thanks to thieves, I've been getting into PC games.
9970000	9983000	And, you know, at least temporarily I've been using games for Windows Live in the marketplace, if only because I have a pre-existing account through Microsoft when I have my 360.
9983000	9984000	Sure.
9984000	10003000	Now, and I noticed that compared to, say, Xbox Live in their marketplace, there's hardly any, for lack of a better term, meaty games, like, let's say, the duels of playing Spockers games.
10003000	10007000	There's no Geometry Wars, no...
10007000	10009000	That's why it failed, sir.
10009000	10012000	That's why it unfortunately has failed.
10012000	10022000	And, unfortunately, what you see there is probably all that's gonna be there, because now it's all about the Windows 8 marketplace is where the future focus is gonna be.
10022000	10026000	I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I think games for Windows is sadly a thing of the past.
10026000	10028000	I could be wrong, you never know.
10028000	10035000	I mean, if people will buy it, maybe they'll still put it there, but I think they're moving on to this whole Windows 8 marketplace is the future.
10035000	10042000	Sucks for those of us that are always a generation or two behind, just because that's where we have to be, right?
10042000	10063000	Yeah, now, that being said, right now my computer has Windows 7 Home Premium installed, and now, would you recommend, based on what you know about Windows 8, would you recommend that upgrade to Windows 8 or stick with 7 Premium?
10063000	10069000	I haven't used it, so it's hard for me to say. I couldn't say, yes, you should upgrade, but I'm not using it myself.
10069000	10076000	I will tell you my hesitation is that I want to see how the compatibility looks with Windows 8 and kind of what the complaints are about it.
10076000	10078000	Also, if it's not broke, don't fix it.
10078000	10086000	Yeah. Most of my friends that are using it, this is kind of the bottom line that I've heard from people that are using it right now.
10086000	10099000	If you're on something before 7, then upgrade, but if you're on 7, eh, there's a few little perks, but it's not something you gotta get right now. It can wait.
10099000	10101000	Alright. Sounds good.
10101000	10107000	Alright, Rachel, I gotta let you go so we can wrap things up, but thank you so much for the call, and thank you for the video.
10107000	10108000	Sure, no problem.
10108000	10109000	Alright, take care, buddy.
10109000	10110000	Alright, bye-bye.
10110000	10111000	Bye.
10111000	10113000	Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.
10113000	10116000	Thank you to all our callers for calling it.
10116000	10120000	You know, now that we have the router and that the stream's not dropping, I think we need to get a studio cam back.
10120000	10122000	I think that might be something we need to do.
10122000	10124000	That way we can look at the listeners when they're calling.
10124000	10131000	Alright, um, that is not gonna do it just yet, because I need to get to the Twitter topics, but that is gonna do it for the Skype line.
10131000	10133000	If you didn't get through, email us.
10133000	10135000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
10136000	10139000	Retertainment tweeted us earlier and said,
10139000	10142000	O-L-R, the Grammys ended with an award.
10142000	10144000	The Emmys ended with an award.
10144000	10146000	The Oscars ended an award.
10146000	10150000	The VGAs ended with Tenacious D.
10150000	10152000	What the fuck?
10152000	10154000	I'd say that's a good ending.
10154000	10156000	Unpopular opinion time.
10156000	10159000	I think Tenacious D is super overrated.
10159000	10161000	I don't think they're that good.
10161000	10162000	That's...
10162000	10164000	I caused Jamie to choke, yay!
10164000	10166000	No, the latke caused me to choke.
10166000	10169000	I know that's unpopular opinion, I'll get hate mail, I just...
10169000	10173000	For the record, when you reheat the latkes, do it on the stove.
10176000	10178000	Poor Jamie. Do you gonna be alright?
10178000	10180000	Do you water?
10180000	10182000	Okay.
10183000	10187000	I don't need an ambulance to interrupt episode of Orange Lounge Radio either.
10187000	10189000	We haven't had evacuation, we haven't had an ambulance.
10189000	10191000	She's putting the hack in Hanukkah.
10194000	10198000	Alright, let's see, Tigerclaw sent us a story lead here.
10198000	10203000	Bronies shut down their My Little Pony MMO, blaming copyright law.
10205000	10208000	You know what got shut down today, actually?
10208000	10209000	What?
10209000	10214000	Two of the largest indexers for Usenet.
10214000	10216000	Do people still use Usenet?
10216000	10219000	For any legitimate purpose whatsoever?
10219000	10221000	Yeah, yeah.
10222000	10224000	Hence why those sites are getting shut down.
10224000	10225000	It's legit.
10225000	10228000	I remember when Usenet was like, actually a...
10228000	10232000	It's legit. I mean, there's totally not pirated stuff on there.
10232000	10236000	But yeah, NZB Matrix and NZB...
10236000	10239000	Or Newsbin 2 got shut down.
10239000	10242000	Alright, so, back to the Brony story.
10242000	10246000	Some Brony developers were putting together My Little Pony online,
10246000	10249000	but a cease and desist came in from Hasbro,
10249000	10251000	but they pressed ahead.
10251000	10254000	They said, screw it, and they moved forward,
10254000	10257000	and they released the game's first episode a month ago.
10257000	10264000	However, Hasbro's lawyers sent down a shutdown demand to HLP online.
10264000	10268000	The team put out a statement, it's very carefully worded,
10268000	10271000	not blaming Hasbro through the shutdown.
10271000	10274000	Quote, Hasbro is not to be blamed here, they wrote.
10274000	10277000	As per US trademark law,
10277000	10279000	as soon as an infringement comes to light,
10279000	10282000	they are obligated to defend the trademark or they will lose it.
10282000	10286000	They had no choice in the matter, regardless of what they thought the project
10286000	10288000	or how it benefited them.
10288000	10290000	There was little we could do to work around it.
10290000	10293000	Discussions continued through the month, but it came down to one fact.
10293000	10296000	MLP online had to come to an end.
10296000	10299000	So it's that whole... You know, we've heard this a couple times this year.
10299000	10301000	I remember the whole gamer thing.
10301000	10303000	Remember when Reddit got su...
10303000	10308000	Not sued yet, but the cease and desist went to Reddit over the gamer thing,
10308000	10312000	where gamer.org had it, and then they said that Reddit had to stop using it.
10312000	10314000	I don't know if that's really been resolved yet,
10314000	10317000	but the guy was like, hey, I have a trademark and I have to protect it.
10317000	10321000	And a lot of people are like, why were you given that trademark in the first place?
10321000	10325000	Now, this is a little different because we can all understand
10325000	10328000	why Hasbro has a trademark on My Little Pony, but...
10329000	10333000	Rama in chat, I know one of our resident bronies says,
10333000	10339000	I'm surprised that Hasbro sent a C&D due to all the episodes floating around on YouTube.
10339000	10343000	Well, if Hasbro gets the magic button, those will all disappear real fast.
10343000	10346000	And the people just talking about it.
10347000	10351000	Are there Watch Me Get High and Watch My Little Pony videos on YouTube?
10351000	10352000	Like, reaction videos?
10352000	10354000	I'm sure there are.
10354000	10356000	Jeez.
10357000	10359000	Never choke on a lot, good people.
10359000	10365000	Tigerclaw tweets us to an article about times lists of the year, gadget of the year.
10365000	10368000	The Wii U, second place.
10368000	10370000	First place for gadget of the year?
10370000	10372000	Loki, you're gonna love this.
10372000	10374000	iPhone 5.
10374000	10376000	Times gadget of the year.
10379000	10381000	Those are tweets from Tigerclaw.
10381000	10383000	Lastly, from SSJ100, Matt.
10383000	10387000	People say Lego City Undercover is like Lego Grand Theft Auto,
10387000	10392000	but someone made a Lego version of the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer,
10392000	10393000	and he links us to it. Have you seen this?
10393000	10394000	I saw it, yeah.
10394000	10395000	What'd you think?
10395000	10399000	It was kind of disappointing because it was the first trailer and not the second one,
10399000	10400000	because the second one would have been really cool.
10400000	10404000	But I mean, obviously that stop motion stuff takes a long time, so it's so cool.
10404000	10405000	But yeah.
10406000	10411000	But yes, Lego City Undercover, I swear to God, was at one time being worked on by Rockstar
10411000	10414000	because you see that first screenshot that they had?
10414000	10419000	Same fucking HUD, same, like, everything as Grand Theft Auto.
10419000	10423000	So I wouldn't be surprised at one time that that was the thing that Rockstar was working on with them,
10423000	10426000	but now it's, you know, Traveler Tales or whatever.
10426000	10428000	Whoever's putting it in, I think it's Traveler Tales.
10428000	10429000	When is that coming out?
10429000	10431000	I don't think they have it.
10431000	10433000	It's supposed to be launch window, so in the next three months?
10433000	10435000	Could be anything.
10435000	10440000	Fuck, I mean, seriously, was it Wii Fit U now is the first half of next year instead of launch window?
10440000	10443000	And the rest of us all March.
10443000	10449000	I mean, that, see, right there, that would have been probably the only, like, if I were to pick up a Wii U,
10449000	10454000	that would be the game I'd probably get, is that Lego City Undercover, because it actually looks pretty awesome.
10454000	10459000	But that's really the only game that's been kind of impressive to me, is just that one.
10463000	10465000	Sorry for the dead air, I was just catching up on chat there.
10465000	10467000	That is actually going to do it.
10467000	10468000	That was it for Twitter Topics.
10468000	10470000	You said you were done with Last Minute Stories, right?
10470000	10471000	I believe I am.
10471000	10475000	So that brings us to a close of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10475000	10476000	Sad.
10476000	10482000	So, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we close up shop tonight.
10482000	10488000	And my final thought, I'll start tonight, my final thought is F you to Jelly Beans, they're addicting too.
10488000	10490000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
10490000	10492000	What, guys?
10492000	10494000	And Loki, your final thought tonight?
10494000	10497000	Check out the VoG Minecraft server if you haven't yet.
10497000	10504000	There's information in our forums on how to sign up, basically just say, hey, I want to sign up,
10504000	10507000	put your username on there, and I add you to the white list.
10507000	10513000	Because now we have, you know, Mob Arena, it's kind of fun just to battle monsters, and it's really fucking hard.
10513000	10516000	So, definitely worth trying it.
10516000	10521000	And just because I want to see more than, like, one person on there at a time, because it's pretty sad.
10522000	10526000	There's, like, it's a ghost town, so we need more people on there.
10526000	10528000	And I don't know how to get more people to come.
10528000	10530000	You need to plan a night.
10530000	10531000	I know, I know.
10531000	10534000	I'm here, and everybody converge this night.
10534000	10537000	And I will try to drop in if it's not like when we take the courthouse or something.
10537000	10540000	Well, I think if I get the mob, because I'm still working on the Mob Arena stuff,
10540000	10547000	I think once I get that done, or it's actually, you know, somewhat, they have some usable classes,
10547000	10551000	because we're still tweaking the classes, because some of them don't make any sense or don't work right.
10551000	10555000	So, once I'm done tweaking that and the waves and stuff like that,
10555000	10558000	because we had a problem at one time where it was just creepers spawning.
10558000	10564000	It was just tons of fucking creepers, and, like, literally you would see, you'd be watching the, you know,
10564000	10567000	up top, and I'd have, like, they have different waves.
10567000	10572000	They have one called a swarm wave, and all the creatures spawn one heart worth of health, but it's a ton of them.
10572000	10577000	So, all of a sudden we saw, like, 30 creepers just, like, poof, just spawned.
10577000	10581000	It was like, holy shit, there's a huge wave of creepers chasing after me.
10581000	10584000	So, it was kind of fun. But, yeah.
10584000	10588000	All right. Black Wolf says, we also need a Forza Horizon Knight.
10588000	10592000	I'll be down for that. That's on my queue for Game Rental games, so I need to send Silent Hill back,
10592000	10593000	because I'm probably not going to play much more of it.
10593000	10597000	I need to check out that game, because I need to use a game for my, uh, I have my steering wheel.
10597000	10599000	That would be fun to mess around with.
10599000	10601000	You know what game I have sitting here, waiting to play?
10601000	10604000	I haven't, I didn't get around to it for this week, but for next week, on the PS3.
10604000	10610000	XCOM, I have from the Rental guys waiting to play, so, excited to check that out.
10610000	10615000	I want the best PC game this year from, uh, I don't, I mean, I'm kind of surprised.
10615000	10621000	I was, um, spending, uh, Thanksgiving with, um, Spike from Game Buoy, if any of you listen to that show.
10621000	10624000	Which, if you don't, you should. They're a fun duo there.
10624000	10628000	But, uh, Spike was showing me XCOM on PC, and I played, like, a round of it,
10628000	10634000	and, uh, it was fun. So, I, I put the game in my Rental queue.
10634000	10636000	There you go. And now I have it.
10636000	10641000	Alright, um, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

10650000	10651000	No, no. I have to get out.
10651000	10653000	My, um, my, uh, mouse died.
