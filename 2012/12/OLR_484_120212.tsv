0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, December 2nd, 2012, a new Wii console is unveiled, a classic console is reborn on iPhone and iPad, and could Sony be planning a break apart controller for the next Playstation?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December 2nd, 2012, episode number 484.
46000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about the latest and greatest in the gaming world and some other things too with my co-hosts. First off, say hello to the one and only Dark Soccer Hour, Jamie Summers.
57000	58000	Hi.
58000	59000	How are you, Jamie Summers?
59000	60000	Doing alright.
60000	64000	Yeah? What's new with you? Hanukkah's coming up real quick, isn't it?
64000	69000	Yeah, I think it starts the 9th. Yeah, so I've got a...
69000	73000	Wait, are you going to be here next week if it starts the 9th? We better figure that out.
73000	78000	I need to find out if the temple is having something. Well, I'll verify the dates and...
78000	80000	I'm glad I thought to ask.
80000	86000	Well, no, because usually my temple does something for the first in whatever, you know, Shabbat is during Hanukkah.
86000	87000	Right.
87000	100000	So I'd have to find out. But I mean, I'm already getting out my little... I have this thing I got at Target of all places that's like little felt candles and you can put them up on this banner.
100000	107000	I'm already getting some of the decorations out of all places. The grocery outlet had six pointed blue Christmas ornaments.
107000	110000	So I was like, I'm going to use these.
110000	111000	Why not?
111000	113000	Yeah, so hooray.
113000	117000	All right. We'll also say hello to Tech Master Loki joining us here in studio.
117000	118000	Hello.
118000	119000	How are you, Loki?
119000	120000	I'm fine.
120000	122000	McDonald's again during the show. Is that like...
122000	123000	It's cheap.
123000	124000	It's like your standard thing now.
124000	126000	Well, it's cheap and I was over there running errands.
126000	127000	Oh, OK.
127000	129000	Not at McDonald's but in the plaza with McDonald's.
129000	132000	I need a Big Mac. Stat.
132000	134000	All right. What else is new with you?
134000	141000	Now I'm still trying to fix the Minecraft server, trying to get this one plug-in mob arena to work correctly.
141000	148000	And I fixed... There was an error in the config file. I fixed that. It's still not accepting any of the commands though.
148000	158000	So I have to look at the permissions again because I took the new permission program out and put the old one back in because I figured, OK, it was just this config file that was broken.
158000	165000	And so now I have to get that to work and if it doesn't work with this one and I have to try the new config or the new permissions file again.
165000	170000	It's just this one plug-in is just being a pain in the ass. So, I don't know.
170000	179000	Correct me if I'm wrong but I think I read something on the Twitters or something about Josh's first gaming experience or something like that or you're trying to breed him a little more as a gamer?
180000	190000	Not his first gaming experience, but no, he wanted to hit the buttons on the arcade cabinet. So we put it on. I turned it on and put Bubble Bubble on and he wants to hit the buttons.
190000	194000	He likes hitting the button to make the bubbles blow from the dinosaur.
194000	201000	That's how we started. Does anyone remember? Does anyone in the studio maybe remember like what turned them on to video games in the first place?
201000	207000	Like I know you have to have like a really young memory for most of us because I know most of us started in like the Coleco Atari era or whatever.
207000	221000	Does anybody remember? Like for me, I think like I don't remember a lot being a kid but I think the fact that I could control what was on the television like besides just the remote but like I could actually like make my own TV show of sorts was kind of what turned me on to gaming.
221000	223000	I don't remember what it was exactly.
223000	232000	For the record, Hanukkah starts on the 8th so I was right in general as far as daytime goes. But there's nothing going on so I'll be here.
232000	233000	Okay, phew, just checking.
233000	234000	I'll let my candle before I go.
235000	238000	Because if I needed a guest host, I like to know that stuff in advance.
238000	240000	I mean unless you just want to give me the night off, I don't know.
240000	243000	You can take a night off, just let me know.
243000	251000	Alright, also say hello to the ever-present fourth guest on our show, The Chatters. You can participate live with us at live.vognetwork.com.
251000	258000	We are live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern or thereabouts right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
258000	267000	And I say thereabouts because sometimes his show runs a little long and that's okay because he's always kind enough to have us on at the end and we do this little like tease across.
267000	275000	So if you've never listened to Bobby's show before, you're missing a little kind of bonus segment with us for lack of a better term at the end of his show every week.
275000	281000	And it's a good show. Like the other 50 minutes of the show are great too. He's one guy talking about games.
281000	290000	I just like to give him a nice little plug there every now and then. And you can check out all the great shows that make up the lineup of The Voice of Geek Network at vognetwork.com.
290000	301000	Again, that's vognetwork.com. Other great shows, Pod Culture, Girls Gone Wow, lots of stuff and hopefully new stuff next year. Who knows? We'll see.
302000	309000	Also in the chat room, AcidicVampire in our chat room says, after you were introduced DarkSakura, AcidicVampire said,
309000	320000	Mrs. Vicarian, I don't know about this because thanks to the Omega DLC this week, you might be going for girls this time, right?
320000	323000	Well, she's dead, so I mean...
323000	324000	Don't spoil! Oh my gosh!
324000	325000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
325000	327000	Oh my God!
328000	341000	She's only in the DLC, I'll put it that way. So it's only a moment. And I just appreciate it. Clearly she has still some residual going on for Miss Aria.
341000	344000	Yeah, there is a little bit of tension going on there, isn't there?
344000	348000	My favorite line, I love it when you're feisty. Wink!
348000	353000	AcidicVampire has changed the line to Mrs. Candrose. There you go.
353000	356000	No, no, Vicarian.
356000	363000	You know what this is going to turn into? This is going to turn into a freaking TV series like they have with Grey's Anatomy or something like that.
363000	366000	Where it's going to be on a starship and it's just going to be drama and people sleeping with each other.
366000	371000	Because that's all that Mass Effect is really. That and a third person shooter.
371000	373000	Yeah, is that a problem?
373000	376000	Yeah, those shows suck.
376000	384000	I'd say it's more like The Walking Dead because I think there's a lot of people that weren't listening to Bobby tonight because The Walking Dead is on at the same time on the East Coast.
384000	387000	It has zombies in it. I mean, this is like drama.
387000	390000	Well, Mass Effect has aliens in it. Alright, look.
390000	393000	And grunt.
393000	400000	Moving on. I actually, I will say this. We're going to get into our gaming week soon enough. I will say this.
400000	408000	Just to make Loki happy with my fandom coming full circle, I did place my order, my $60 order for the Mass Effect trilogy on Playstation 3.
408000	411000	Which will be shipped the day the game is launched.
411000	413000	Well, now it's complete.
413000	417000	That means the only system I don't have it on now is Wii U.
417000	420000	But I'm going to, I'm holding off on that until they fix some of the DLC.
420000	422000	Which I do need to issue an errata.
422000	426000	You know, heaven forbid we ever misspeak on Orange Launch Radio and I say something wrong.
426000	433000	But I did last week. I said that none of the multiplayer DLC was available on Mass Effect 3 Wii U.
433000	438000	That is incorrect. It does include the first three multiplayer download packs.
438000	441000	But I believe it is missing this most recent one still.
441000	445000	It is still missing something that the other consoles have.
445000	449000	But it's still lame. The options that you're not allowed to carry over.
449000	452000	Yeah, well that's a whole other thing.
452000	456000	Which people will get to hear once a certain podcast is available.
456000	461000	Get careful. I'll have you taken out and back and roughed up too like a chatter who was trying to spoil it earlier.
461000	464000	But what was I going to say about all that?
464000	467000	I don't know if this is just rumor or fan wank or what.
467000	472000	But supposedly Mass Effect 3 Wii U is selling better than BioWare had anticipated.
472000	477000	So they are looking at, I mean I guess that kind of stuff is always a possibility.
477000	480000	We only thought we'd sell a copy and we sold two.
480000	482000	Who knows? Who knows?
482000	487000	Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. I want to do a kickoff topic real quick.
487000	492000	It's been very stormy here in Northern California over the past few days. It's just finally cleared up.
492000	493000	You call this a storm?
493000	498000	Well, for us yes. I do call it a storm. It is very much a storm for Northern California.
498000	503000	Because our part of the land is not built to handle the same types of weather as other parts.
503000	504000	But anyway.
504000	506000	This land is your land.
506000	512000	I'm just saying it's been flooding everywhere. I'm surprised you guys didn't drive through flooded streetways to get here.
512000	517000	But yeah, it's been pretty crazy. I don't know about you guys but on nights like these I like to stay in and play video games.
517000	523000	So like over this stormy season are there any games that you're looking forward to catching up on?
523000	527000	Things you're trying to play over the next month or so?
527000	532000	I know for me I have a huge backlog of games on Steam that I've really got to get through.
532000	535000	And that doesn't even count the Mass Effect trilogy.
535000	538000	But I've also got some games coming in from my rental service.
538000	542000	I'm going to give Forza a try because some of our VoG fans have been talking about it.
542000	544000	And whatever else they end up sending me.
544000	546000	So I don't know. Is there any catch up games?
546000	548000	Like things, Loki, you were talking about before the show.
548000	550000	Like I have all these games I haven't even touched.
550000	553000	Well yeah, it's because I just remembered to go through.
553000	559000	I'd actually had, I was adding all my Steam codes for the humble bundles I have and stuff.
559000	560000	Like past ones.
560000	562000	Like there's some that I haven't even redeemed yet.
562000	564000	And most of them I have not played yet.
564000	567000	And even the stuff from like the last Summer Sale or whatever.
567000	571000	Most of the games that I've bought there I have not played.
572000	575000	So I have a ton of games I could be playing.
575000	581000	And then on top of that, just the stuff that I did buy and played a little bit of on console.
581000	585000	That I still have to play more and more Minecraft.
585000	588000	So I got plenty of stuff to keep me busy.
588000	591000	Jim Sally in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
591000	596000	Actually Rob, Walking Dead is on now on the East Coast and I'm skipping it for you.
596000	598000	I guess apparently it's on at 9.
598000	601000	Well thank you guys for skipping that show to come be with us.
601000	606000	That's why they invented DVR and Hulu and other ways to watch TV shows later on.
606000	608000	Even though I have yet to watch any Walking Dead.
608000	609000	I'm not hating on it.
609000	613000	I hardly watch any TV shows unless it's RuPaul's Drag Race.
613000	615000	Or Happy Endings actually.
615000	616000	I strangely like that show.
616000	618000	It's weird. Anyway.
618000	621000	Dark Sakura, anything that you're trying to catch up on?
621000	626000	Well I've been trying to get my newly purchased copy of Sonic Generations to download.
626000	628000	Because I've really wanted to play that game.
628000	630000	And I got it way cheap on Steam.
630000	631000	I love Steam.
631000	634000	I'm playing that stupid Faerie Solitaire game.
634000	636000	Because I want to beat it this year.
636000	641000	But other than that, I got another game that just looks so cool to me.
641000	643000	And it had been kind of on my radar for a little bit.
643000	645000	But I finally just broke down and bought it.
645000	647000	It's a game called Closure.
647000	648000	I haven't played it yet.
648000	652000	Where it's basically all black and white.
652000	656000	And it uses the light to create your area around you.
656000	659000	So basically wherever the light shines, it exists.
659000	662000	If the light isn't shining there, it doesn't exist.
662000	666000	Meaning you can create holes in the ground and drop down into other levels.
666000	670000	And it's a really neat application of physics.
670000	673000	So it's been on my radar for a little while and I've wanted to play it.
673000	674000	So I finally just downloaded it.
674000	677000	Other than that, I'm playing my usual.
677000	678000	There you go.
678000	680000	I touched WoW.
680000	681000	It liked it.
681000	684000	You pretty much just did your gaming week together with the question, didn't you?
684000	686000	Yeah, because a lot of it's combined.
686000	688000	I've downloaded the stuff, I've prepped it.
688000	691000	Now it just doesn't matter sitting down and playing it.
691000	694000	You were talking a little bit about Project Greenlight stuff before the show.
694000	696000	Is that something you've been participating with?
696000	700000	I'm looking to see what the new stuff coming in is and if it interests me or not.
700000	702000	I've watched the trailers for a few things and I was like, eh, crap.
702000	704000	It just hasn't interested me.
704000	705000	I've got like one thing.
705000	708000	Not every idea is something you're going to jump up and go woo at.
708000	710000	But there's some good things on there.
710000	712000	I've been poking around in there too.
712000	715000	But the other thing going on is that I want to hook up the Dreamcast.
715000	719000	And actually I've had this urge to play through Grandia 2 again.
719000	721000	So I'm thinking about playing it.
721000	723000	Or the SNES and playing through Earthbound.
723000	724000	Yeah.
724000	727000	Yeah, I was thinking about revisiting some classics too.
727000	728000	I don't know.
728000	731000	I thought it would be fun to get one of those little streaming things for the TV
731000	734000	and do a little streaming session of a game.
734000	736000	And that's something I've been talking about for forever.
736000	740000	And it's one of those new media things that we've completely missed the boat on.
740000	742000	You know what we should do?
742000	744000	We should actually play through Secret of Mana.
744000	745000	It would be fun.
745000	746000	O2 player?
746000	747000	Yeah.
747000	748000	Why not?
748000	749000	Why not?
749000	751000	I don't even know if I've beaten that game.
751000	752000	I think I got all the way to the end.
752000	753000	But I don't think I've ever actually beaten it.
753000	754000	I have beaten it.
754000	756000	Same thing with Secret of Evermore.
756000	757000	Go figure.
757000	759000	You and secrets, Rob.
759000	762000	Well I have a whole week off from Christmas to New Year.
762000	764000	And I was originally going to go to Vegas.
764000	765000	But that probably isn't happening.
765000	768000	So I'm going to have all this time and nothing to do.
768000	770000	So we'll see.
770000	771000	All right.
771000	773000	Since we got into our gaming weeks already, Loki, why don't you go next?
773000	775000	How was your gaming week?
775000	779000	This week I played Black Ops 2 a bit more.
779000	781000	We finally finished up playing all the multiplayer maps.
781000	784000	And now we're just kind of going back and playing whatever we want to play.
784000	789000	And I finished the single player campaign, which actually ended kind of short.
789000	791000	It was starting to get really good.
791000	793000	And then it's like, and done.
793000	801000	It's like that one that they were showing kind of in all the trailers and stuff where all the drones are attacking L.A. and that kind of thing.
801000	803000	That's the second to last mission of the game.
803000	808000	And so right after that, it's like, oh, we're going to attack where the source is coming from.
808000	810000	And game over.
810000	813000	It's like, okay, that was interesting.
813000	815000	And I guess there's multiple endings to the game.
815000	820000	But, dude, I don't even know, like, all the different things that you do in the game.
820000	825000	There's only like a, it must have been like three, maybe two second clip.
825000	831000	It's like something happens and then I guess that changes based on how you play the game.
831000	839000	So, woohoo, a five second clip that I, you know, affected by playing the game differently in different spots.
839000	841000	I don't know. It's just kind of weird.
841000	845000	I don't know if, I probably wouldn't go back and replay through all the campaign again.
845000	848000	But it was fun the first time.
848000	851000	It's just, I wish it was longer because it was actually pretty cool.
851000	854000	And it was getting really good and then just like, done.
854000	857000	We're done with that.
857000	859000	Also played Far Cry 3.
859000	861000	That game is fantastic.
861000	864000	And, you know, playing through the single player campaign of that.
864000	867000	Very cinematic.
867000	870000	You know, I love the detail in the jungle.
870000	873000	I mean, it's pretty awesome for like even a console game.
873000	875000	Reminds me a lot of like Just Cause 2.
875000	877000	Just, you know, the locale and everything.
877000	880000	And even the AI is kind of stupid sometimes.
880000	882000	Which is kind of fun.
882000	883000	So I like that.
883000	888000	And I also like how chaotic everything is with, you know, you'll be going up to attack somebody.
888000	892000	And all of a sudden they get eaten by a tiger or something.
892000	895000	It's just, you know, oh hey, there's a tiger there.
895000	897000	That's unusual.
897000	903000	But one of the fun things I like doing with it is, you know, you can hunt animals in the game.
903000	907000	And it's kind of an exploit, I guess.
907000	909000	But the animals can't attack you in a car.
909000	913000	So you just drive over the animal with the car.
913000	915000	Oh, we got to hunt a tiger because it's very dangerous.
915000	916000	Hit it with the car!
916000	918000	Peeta's calling and telling you to stop.
918000	920000	Peeta can bite my ass.
920000	921000	It's fantastic.
921000	924000	It's like, oh, you know, you're trying to kill me.
924000	926000	You know, I'm going to shoot at you.
926000	927000	Get you to run back towards me.
927000	929000	Hop in my car and hit you with the car.
930000	932000	Or, you know, the same thing with Komodo dragons.
932000	936000	Like, they'll just gang up on you and just boop, boop, back and forth.
936000	937000	And they're dead.
937000	939000	And they'll collect their skins.
939000	942000	Or even better is that you get these animals to chase after you.
942000	946000	They run back to, like, one of the outposts that you've taken over.
946000	948000	And your men kill them.
948000	951000	Or you can hang out at one of those outposts where, like, these animals are normally.
951000	955000	And they'll just keep spawning and your men will keep killing them and you just loot everything.
955000	958000	Even if one of the guys dies, you just loot him.
959000	960000	It's fantastic.
960000	962000	I just love manipulating all that stuff.
962000	965000	And it's a pretty interesting storyline.
965000	970000	I went through one of the first, like, kind of drug trip moments in the game.
970000	972000	That was interesting.
972000	974000	I really like the way they did it, though.
974000	975000	It was pretty cool.
975000	977000	And let's see what else.
977000	978000	A little bit of Minecraft.
978000	981000	Still trying to get this damn plug in the work.
981000	982000	And it's been pissing me off.
982000	984000	But just some reminder stuff.
985000	989000	We've got, you know, it's at vog-minecraft.com to check out.
989000	991000	Right now it's just a dynamic map.
991000	994000	But eventually, once I get everything working on the server, I'm going to actually...
994000	997000	I'm going to load that site and hope it doesn't break the show as it loads.
997000	998000	It shouldn't break the show.
998000	999000	It's not that bad.
999000	1000000	Wow.
1000000	1002000	It looks like the map has even expanded more since the last time I checked.
1002000	1003000	It's possible.
1003000	1004000	We've been still trying to...
1004000	1009000	We've been running into some things that are not working because I'm loading in so many plugins.
1009000	1010000	Like certain...
1010000	1015000	I think it's a lot of the craft book stuff was just causing things to not work right.
1015000	1021000	Because they have different blocks that make the mine cart do different things.
1021000	1023000	And so some of them weren't stopping.
1023000	1031000	Or my whole roller coaster thing stopped working because all the blocks that made up the roller coaster were actually the reverse direction blocks in that plugin.
1031000	1032000	So that was kind of fun.
1032000	1034000	I haven't logged into Minecraft in forever.
1034000	1035000	I'm sorry, you guys.
1035000	1036000	Nah, no one has.
1037000	1040000	I see Hitstun talking about it in the VoG thread.
1040000	1041000	Yeah, he does.
1041000	1042000	He does.
1042000	1043000	But...
1043000	1044000	We need to set a night.
1044000	1045000	Yeah.
1045000	1048000	This is a Minecraft orgy night, but not like an actual orgy.
1048000	1051000	I wanted to do that, but eventually we'll get there.
1051000	1054000	Right now, like I said, I'm trying to set up this arena.
1054000	1058000	Because I know I've got everything in there and it's pretty awesome.
1058000	1061000	I just need to get that actual hit off the ground.
1061000	1068000	But yeah, you can go to VoG-Minecraft.com for the 3D map and you can actually poke around and see what people are building and stuff.
1068000	1070000	And you can actually see people when they're in-game.
1070000	1075000	And I think you can even chat with them too through that window, which is kind of neat.
1075000	1078000	I gotta ask you about this since you're a Minecraft fan and all the listeners as well.
1078000	1082000	Because I'm sure a lot of the listeners that we have would not have seen this, but it's really funny.
1082000	1086000	I actually found this on Reddit on the gamers community.
1087000	1091000	Have you ever heard of this app that they have on the iPhone called a grinder?
1091000	1092000	Have you ever heard of that?
1092000	1098000	It's kind of like a friend finder, but a lot of people use it for more than friends, if you know what I'm saying, right?
1098000	1099000	A lot of people do that.
1099000	1103000	Well, somebody set up this profile on there called Steve.
1103000	1107000	And they actually have a picture of Steve from Minecraft.
1107000	1109000	It says, no creepers, please.
1109000	1113000	Hello, my name is Steve. I like to go mining in caves and crafting things on my workbench.
1113000	1115000	My favorite food is cookies.
1115000	1117000	So somebody messages him out of the blue.
1117000	1120000	Hi, sexy. Lovely blue eyes. Like the sea.
1120000	1121000	And they send a picture.
1121000	1123000	Any other pictures for me there, sexy?
1123000	1126000	And Steve replies back, hello, sir. How are you?
1126000	1128000	Yes, I have many a picture for you.
1128000	1132000	And sends back a picture with the pig and the lamb, like from the game.
1132000	1134000	Like these are game screenshots.
1134000	1136000	Like you can't mistake this for a video game.
1136000	1140000	And the guy replies back, so very handsome indeed.
1140000	1141000	Do you live on a farm?
1142000	1144000	And Steve replies, I move around a lot.
1144000	1148000	I often have to quickly build shelter out of dirt and cobblestone before sunset.
1148000	1151000	And the guy replies back, so you're a handyman.
1151000	1153000	You must be quite fit too then.
1153000	1155000	Are you into older men?
1155000	1156000	Another picture perhaps.
1156000	1161000	And so another in-game picture comes back and says, you know, I can outrun skeletons and zombies.
1161000	1163000	And the guy like doesn't get it.
1163000	1164000	Wanna meet?
1164000	1168000	And so Steve replies, okay, have you got any redstone for a compass?
1168000	1170000	What are your X and Z coordinates?
1170000	1173000	And the guy goes, I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
1173000	1175000	And so the guy replies back with a picture of a compass.
1175000	1177000	Well, obviously the guy's trolling.
1177000	1180000	He's hella trolling, but it's funny that the guy's fallen for, poor guy.
1180000	1183000	I don't think he's falling for it. I mean, come on.
1183000	1185000	I don't see how anyone can be that stupid.
1185000	1187000	You never know. You never know.
1187000	1189000	Unless, you know, unless he's like.
1189000	1191000	This guy probably knows nothing about.
1191000	1193000	Unless he's like visually impaired or something like that.
1193000	1196000	And so his, you know, computer or whatever is reading back the text.
1196000	1201000	And he doesn't, doesn't realize that it's, you know, a picture of a, you know.
1201000	1203000	I have a question though.
1203000	1208000	Like, can you decide who, uh, uh, like what your character looks like?
1208000	1209000	Yes.
1209000	1210000	Okay, good.
1210000	1211000	You can completely draw.
1211000	1212000	Even though I don't own the camera.
1212000	1214000	Yes, I play as Zangief.
1214000	1216000	Let me link that in chat. There you go.
1216000	1218000	See if you want to see that for yourself there.
1218000	1219000	Yeah, so.
1219000	1221000	Okay, someone did the best thing on Tumblr.
1222000	1229000	They took Garris and Tali and put them in, um, a horse drawn carriage and then had, uh, Gordon Freeman decorating a tree.
1229000	1232000	You and your fandom need to stop derailing the show. Yes, Loki?
1232000	1240000	Well, one of the other things I saw an article about how to render like, you know, Minecraft worlds and stuff like that to like pretty awesome 3D images.
1240000	1242000	So probably do that too at some point.
1242000	1246000	Maybe on the website once, you know, like I said, once I get this stupid plug in the work.
1247000	1253000	Then it'll be all gravy, but it's just right now, it's just refusing to accept any of the commands I put into it.
1253000	1257000	It's just like, nope, no thanks, sorry, not going to do that.
1257000	1259000	Um, so I just have to figure out why.
1259000	1265000	It's something with the permissions now because I got the config file working correctly, I think.
1265000	1268000	So, I don't know, we'll figure it out eventually.
1268000	1272000	Um, and then also I played, uh, was it, uh, SkillRex?
1272000	1275000	Um, or Skrillex, I guess?
1275000	1279000	The, uh, Legend of Skrillex or whatever the hell that game was.
1279000	1281000	It's some like Skrillex game.
1281000	1283000	Oh yeah, I think that's a news item later.
1283000	1285000	Yeah, but it's pretty awesome.
1285000	1286000	It's, uh...
1286000	1288000	Really? Skrillex? Awesome?
1288000	1291000	Well, the game's awesome. I think it was kind of cool.
1291000	1297000	I mean, it's a little bit like Zelda and stuff, but it's done by the same guy that did the, um, Perfect Strangers game.
1298000	1299000	Oh, okay.
1299000	1300000	Does it have Belki in it?
1300000	1302000	That game was pretty fucking rad.
1302000	1303000	Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
1303000	1304000	Alright, I give it a pass then.
1304000	1306000	So, that was it.
1306000	1309000	Alright, uh, My Gaming Week. Not a lot of new stuff.
1309000	1317000	Uh, Warcraft got a big patch this week, so I was playing a lot of that because, you know, there's upgrades to go for and, uh, things from my other show, Horde House.
1317000	1320000	Um, I did play some more, uh, Wii U.
1320000	1325000	I played more Super Mario Brothers U, or what, a new Super Mario Brothers U.
1325000	1328000	Um, I haven't beat it yet, but I'm getting really close.
1328000	1331000	I think I'm on the last level before the castle level, so...
1331000	1335000	And then I hear once you beat it, like any Mario game, it's gonna have, you know, all new stuff.
1335000	1340000	And I know, I already know these exits have multiple levels and shit, so I'm having a good time with it.
1340000	1341000	It's, it's fun.
1341000	1344000	Uh, also on the Wii U, I did download something new.
1344000	1352000	Uh, I decided to kind of try out the process of a download title, and so I wanted to download one that looked interesting to me.
1352000	1355000	So I checked out Mighty Switch Force Hyper Drive Edition.
1355000	1365000	Uh, first I gotta say, though, again with the whole Nintendo LOL online part, not the most fun to try and download.
1365000	1368000	Well, I don't know. I guess it was a step above the Wii.
1368000	1373000	You go in, you fill out your information, you can at least use the little touch pad, which makes it faster, whatever.
1373000	1381000	And it will download in the background while you play other games, but if you turn your system off, the download stops.
1381000	1386000	Unless you go into download management and say, power off my system when the downloads are done.
1386000	1389000	Like, it's not really proactive about it, so I kind of learned that the hard way.
1389000	1391000	Alright, so whatever. I had to wait for the download.
1391000	1397000	Once the thing was finally done downloading, it took four minutes to install.
1397000	1404000	Like, what are you doing where you just downloaded the whole, now what are you doing for four minutes to install a game that's only half a gig?
1404000	1406000	Yeah, but the PS3 does the same thing.
1406000	1411000	It's not as bad, though. Like, PS3, 60 seconds tops for a download game.
1411000	1413000	Four minutes on the Wii U? I don't know.
1413000	1417000	Well, it must be that underclocked CPU that they rumored to have in that system.
1417000	1420000	Yeah, it was a little clunky, so I was not a fan of that.
1420000	1424000	But whatever, I mean, it's not the worst thing I've ever experienced.
1424000	1430000	And again, that's not a slam on the game, that's just, you know, I was trying to see what the Wii U download experience would be like.
1430000	1433000	And I was like, alright, well that's different.
1433000	1442000	But the game itself is fun. It's a pretty simple, well I shouldn't say simple because that makes it sound bad, but the premise is pretty simplistic.
1442000	1449000	It plays like a little platformer. I guess they had a version of this on the 3DS in the download shop, but I never played it.
1449000	1456000	Which lends itself fabulously to Loki's whole theory about all your DS games are going to come out on Wii U, just wait.
1457000	1467000	But what was cool about this is that, you know, you can either play with the action going on on the TV and like a little radar on your Wii U pad along with the lives and all that.
1467000	1470000	Or you can hit a button and have the whole game on the pad.
1470000	1473000	So I like those games where you kind of have the option to do one or the other.
1473000	1480000	But the game itself, you're trying to find these five prisoners in a level, and they're all anime babes.
1480000	1485000	You're trying to find these prisoners in a level and you have like jump, shoot, and switch.
1485000	1488000	And the switch will make blocks appear and disappear.
1488000	1492000	And it's either like one way or the other way. There's only like two configurations.
1492000	1500000	But then it gets more complicated where the blocks might actually be like launchers from like Sonic the Hedgehog that'll like make you fire in a certain direction.
1500000	1506000	And then you have to use these bomb enemies, put them in the launchers to explode blocks across the page.
1506000	1508000	You know, just kind of like a puzzle platformer.
1508000	1510000	But I like those type of games, so it's fun.
1510000	1512000	It looks like there's only about 20 levels, though.
1512000	1517000	But it's already getting, like you're really having to think like even as early as like stage four or five.
1517000	1523000	AlphaKnanagram wants to say about Mighty Switch Force in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1523000	1527000	The thing is, Mighty Switch Force wasn't a DS-ish game.
1527000	1531000	It mainly just used the top screen so it could come out on the Vita.
1531000	1535000	And that's very true. You can play the whole game on the touchpad only.
1535000	1538000	So you can do the game all on one screen.
1538000	1544000	The second screen enhances it, and I use that term very loosely, with the whole radar.
1544000	1548000	Which is a neat thing, but it's not necessary to the game.
1548000	1552000	And I'm okay with that because I don't think the 3DS, or ex-
1552000	1554000	The Wii U.
1554000	1556000	I mean the same thing, I mean.
1556000	1565000	I don't think the Wii U should whore that second screen too much because you're not physically capable of seeing two screens at once.
1565000	1572000	Unless it's one of those Nintendo Land games where you hold the thing up to the TV and like the little ninja game or things like that.
1572000	1577000	Like there's some games that are built that way, but most of the gaming experiences aren't built like that.
1577000	1580000	So I'm okay with the second screen being like informational.
1580000	1582000	Glance down here occasionally.
1582000	1585000	A sub-screen that you don't have to hit the button to switch to.
1585000	1587000	Like I think that's an okay use of it.
1588000	1598000	AlphaKananagram also wants to point out that Mighty Flip Champs, which is kind of like a cousin series also by WayForward, did come out on the PSP.
1598000	1600000	Maybe it was a PS Mini.
1600000	1603000	Anyhow, I like the game. It's a $10 game.
1603000	1607000	That's where most of the Wii U downloads seem to be priced. It's around 10-15 bucks.
1607000	1609000	I thought it was-
1609000	1612000	I didn't sit there going, I wasted my money on this experiment.
1612000	1615000	I was like, oh this game is kind of fun and I would play this again.
1615000	1622000	It would be really awesome if I could like beam it to my 3DS and have it on the go, but I know that's asking a lot of Nintendo.
1622000	1624000	Anyway.
1624000	1626000	So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
1626000	1630000	So before we get into the news, quickly some plugs.
1630000	1633000	Of course follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1633000	1637000	And you can also follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1637000	1640000	We are on Google Plus as well under Orange Lounge Radio.
1640000	1644000	And I want to plug our mailbag. You can always send us emails. We'll get to those in the second half of the show.
1644000	1646000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1646000	1650000	And again, please help us support all indie podcasts.
1650000	1653000	I always like to just plug all indie podcasts and the hard people.
1653000	1658000	You know, the hard working people behind producing these shows.
1658000	1661000	And especially the ones on the Voice of the Geeks Network.
1661000	1664000	Voggenetwork.com. Especially those shows.
1664000	1667000	Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news. Loki.
1667000	1671000	So holy crap, Nintendo announces another system.
1671000	1675000	But except it's only for Canadian. I know it's Canada.
1675000	1682000	Wii Mini. And what Wii Mini is is a really small version of the Wii that lacks a lot of things.
1682000	1688000	Including SD card support. Wi-Fi support. Or actually any internet connection support.
1688000	1695000	And yeah. It's basically just if you want to play games.
1695000	1699000	And that is it. Some games.
1699000	1704000	But it's pretty. It's pretty small. And I kind of like the way it looks.
1704000	1707000	I mean, it looks like it's got a top loader disk drive to it.
1707000	1710000	And it's red. Well at least it's black with red trim on it.
1710000	1713000	And the controllers that come with it are red.
1713000	1718000	It's going to be available December 7th for $99.99. I'm assuming that's Canadian.
1718000	1724000	And also not compatible with GameCube disks. But most of the Wii's nowadays are not.
1724000	1728000	So that's not a big surprise.
1728000	1734000	Yeah. So game system. Red nunchuck. Red Wiimote Plus.
1734000	1740000	And sensor bar. Power adapter. And composite cable. For $99.99.
1740000	1742000	Pretty cool looking.
1742000	1745000	Lots of people on there. I'm surprised you're speaking as nicely of this as you are.
1745000	1750000	Lots of people on the interwebs. Don't get it. Why this? You're pushing the Wii U.
1750000	1751000	What the hell is this about?
1751000	1755000	This is one of the price points down really low. And I think they figured a lot of people.
1755000	1759000	Let's be honest. Their online was kind of eh. I mean it was alright.
1759000	1761000	You can download virtual console games and stuff like that.
1761000	1766000	Well obviously you can't do that now. You can't download any DLC or any downloads whatsoever with this.
1766000	1772000	But I mean they had that kind of in place where not a lot of people were probably utilizing it.
1772000	1777000	Especially like grandpa and grandma are probably not downloading virtual console games.
1777000	1780000	They probably don't even know how to do that.
1780000	1788000	So this is more trying to get into I guess those places where people are looking for a cheap gaming system.
1788000	1793000	You know they haven't jumped into this. And maybe you get hooked on this and you'll buy something else.
1793000	1799000	Although it's kind of weird to see this coming out so late because there's really not a whole lot of Wii games coming out.
1799000	1803000	Like you know if this was something that they were introducing towards the end of the life cycle.
1803000	1809000	Not like literally at you know eleven fifty nine of the clock you know Wii.
1809000	1816000	I mean it's pretty much done here. But there's already a gigantic library out there.
1816000	1818000	I mean it's not there's like a lack of Wii software.
1818000	1824000	Yeah that's true. But I mean I don't think that they would want to try building up there.
1824000	1829000	It's kind of like what they did remember with the PSP. They had like a PSP version or whatever with no Wi-Fi and stuff.
1829000	1834000	And it was supposed to be really cheap. I just I don't know. It's kind of weird that they put that out.
1834000	1837000	But it's a little weird but I get it. I mean I do get it.
1837000	1844000	And I think the thing we have to remember is that if you're listening to this show chances are very strongly this console was not for you.
1844000	1848000	Like if you have if you're listening to this show and you haven't bought a Wii by now.
1848000	1852000	I don't think like Nintendo was going to win you over. And this really wasn't meant for you.
1852000	1859000	This is really just for people who want you know oh I've always wanted Wii Sports but oh it's only $99 now.
1859000	1864000	Maybe I'll get it now. Or you know a real cheap alternative to have in the kids room.
1864000	1872000	And the fact that it doesn't have internet actually is a great selling point for parents who might be trying to control you know very heavily what their kids are doing.
1872000	1878000	There's a lot of households that want to lock that down. Maybe not the type again that are listening to this show.
1878000	1884000	But I just think you know this is just for a different type of audience obviously and I think most people are figuring that out.
1884000	1892000	But it's weird that it's only coming out in Canada. Like is it a test market thing?
1892000	1896000	I think it's a test market because if you think about it they don't want to mass produce these things and have them not sell.
1896000	1905000	So these are just a mass producing for one market and then that way if it's a flop you're not stuck with millions of these or probably not millions but hundreds of thousands of them.
1906000	1909000	You're only stuck with you know a few thousands instead.
1909000	1916000	Also something to consider it's not completely unheard of for Nintendo to do this thing well after the other console has started.
1916000	1923000	Like I believe correct me if I'm wrong but those top loader NES's came out like right when the Super Nintendo's were already coming out.
1923000	1928000	And then I think the Super Nintendo got a remake as well when the 64's came out.
1928000	1938000	I don't remember if the 64's got a remake around GameCube but you still had like the Pokemon 64 and there were some other little remodels that came out you know relatively late in the life.
1938000	1940000	And then GameCube.
1940000	1943000	PS2 did the same thing and PS1 yeah.
1943000	1944000	Right right.
1944000	1948000	So I mean well those see even with Sony though that tends to happen kind of like mid-cycle.
1948000	1950000	Nintendo's always done it very late.
1950000	1953000	So this whole Wii mini it's not unheard of.
1953000	1955000	It's like the DSi XL you know.
1955000	1963000	It's weird that they're taking some of the features away but I guess if they want to get at that bargain basement price and you know maybe they're trying to see.
1963000	1967000	Maybe they think somebody who wants internet in their device ought to just get a Wii U.
1969000	1972000	ActDeft asks does the mini come with Wii Sports though?
1972000	1974000	No it comes with nothing.
1974000	1975000	Interesting.
1975000	1980000	So remember none of the systems sell with Wii Sports anymore.
1980000	1987000	They actually well I mean they have a bundle with one but they've got it being sold separately now for 20 bucks.
1987000	1992000	How easy though is it to get like a copy of Wii Sports at GameStop for probably like five bucks.
1992000	1993000	Yeah.
1993000	1996000	Or EB Canada or whatever they have up there you know.
1996000	1998000	So anyway.
1998000	2002000	Yeah I mean obviously it's not something I would pick up anytime soon.
2002000	2008000	It's neat but I kind of want to see someone hack this apart you know to add all those features back in.
2008000	2011000	Well I mean you know an SD card slot might be kind of nice.
2011000	2015000	But I mean if they had an SD card slot you could buy that and then.
2015000	2018000	What would you use the SD card slot for when there's no internet?
2018000	2023000	You use it for loading the homebrew channel and then all the x-rays that go along with it.
2023000	2024000	Okay there you go.
2024000	2031000	Alright VX Jason XV in our chat says the GameCube wasn't remodeled but there was the Panasonic Cube.
2031000	2036000	I think that was only in Japan and again that wasn't a late cycle thing that was actually really early on wasn't it.
2037000	2040000	Yeah Panasonic Cube was pretty early.
2040000	2042000	So that was I always kind of wanted one of those.
2042000	2043000	Not anymore.
2043000	2045000	Expensive for just a DVD player.
2045000	2049000	I remember seeing them in I think in Japantown in LA we would see them.
2049000	2051000	They were like $700 or something crazy like that.
2051000	2055000	So yeah I wasn't going to be getting one anytime soon.
2055000	2063000	Alright moving on to a story about something that's been kind of controversial and on a lot of blogs and so forth this week.
2063000	2073000	It is a new Humble Bundle but this one's got some people raising their eyebrows because it's the Humble THQ Bundle.
2073000	2079000	So it's no longer the Humble Indie Bundle it's now selling THQ games.
2079000	2087000	However there's still the charity you can split the money between THQ charity and the Humble Bundle website tip.
2087000	2092000	You can give all your money to one or the other you know you can adjust the sliders just like any of the previous packs.
2092000	2095000	It comes with the soundtracks for all the games as well.
2095000	2097000	Here's the other sticking point for a lot of people.
2097000	2101000	These games are only available on Windows Steam.
2101000	2103000	And in Canada. I'm kidding.
2103000	2105000	No don't start lies.
2105000	2106000	No no no.
2106000	2114000	But they're only available on Windows Steam because THQ has imported these games to Linux or things like that and I guess they don't have plans to.
2114000	2121000	And the Steam part means there is DRM and the Humble Bundle usually doesn't have DRM.
2121000	2127000	Usually you can get a Steam key to load the games in Steam which is what a lot of people do that's what I do.
2127000	2135000	But you can also once you've bought a bundle you have a key that works forever that you can go into the site and just download the game on a whim.
2135000	2141000	If I wanted to I could go to a friend's house download the game install it and you know it would never know.
2141000	2149000	I mean with the Humble Bundle being open and pay what you want you're not supposed to really do that but if you want to it's there.
2150000	2161000	But there's a lot of people that are I don't want to say they're saying that the Humble Bundle is selling out but I'm looking at a story on the Penny Arcade report that says it is a step backward.
2162000	2163000	I don't get it.
2164000	2173000	And it's not that like I have some I actually usually really respect in particular the Penny Arcade report and don't mishear me I'm not saying I don't respect him over this story.
2173000	2178000	I mean we always are welcome to having difference of opinion this is why we you know have the internet in the first place.
2178000	2185000	But I was I kind of had a little bit of a frown at this story because I was like this reads like gamer entitlement in a way to me.
2185000	2187000	And I was really disappointed.
2187000	2194000	Doesn't make any sense either because you would think that you know this is basically a way for the Humble Bundle guys to kind of get a little bit more traffic on their site.
2194000	2204000	And if anything it's still more money being thrown at Child's Play Charities something I would think that Penny Arcade would be kind of okay for you know hey it's more donations for Child's Play potentially.
2204000	2211000	I mean granted it's okay some THQ games not necessarily indie games but they're not calling it an indie bundle they're calling it the THQ bundle.
2211000	2218000	They never said you know on the site that we're only going to do indie games they just this is what they've been offering so far.
2220000	2221000	Don't buy it if you don't like it.
2221000	2226000	Again this is from the Penny Arcade report I'm going to read a little quote here quote.
2227000	2234000	Indies have been replaced by a single big name studio DRM is back and the variety of platforms supported has been shrunk.
2234000	2236000	This isn't a Humble Bundle it's a Steam Sale.
2238000	2242000	No it's not a Steam Sale you can't donate all your money to a Steam Sale to charity.
2242000	2246000	That's a huge difference a huge difference for a lot of people there.
2246000	2248000	You can't also pay what you want on a Steam Sale.
2248000	2251000	That's right you still have to pay some sort of price there on a Steam Sale.
2251000	2257000	I get the whole it stinks because they don't support all of the platforms.
2257000	2265000	That's the part I'm kind of with them at but at the same token I'm like well this is better than nothing at all.
2265000	2269000	And who said the Humble Bundle has to deliver something all the time.
2269000	2273000	I see the Humble Bundle quite frankly as gifts to the industry.
2273000	2280000	Pay what you want donate to charity lots of great games that's a freaking gift to the industry.
2281000	2283000	Why are we feeling entitled?
2283000	2294000	That's bad that's really bad and it just made it kind of disappointed me that websites like this that I'm like 99% of the time like I'm with your brother.
2294000	2299000	Went down this road Ars Technica another one that wrote a piece that was very critical of it and I read that side all the time.
2299000	2300000	I think it's a great site.
2300000	2301000	Good for page hits.
2301000	2303000	I guess that's true.
2303000	2307000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says this isn't the EA Indie Bundle.
2308000	2310000	Ain't that the truth.
2310000	2311000	That was a thing easy.
2311000	2316000	You know making a joke there on something that was real very tongue in cheek there.
2316000	2326000	I honestly I think that actually even though it's DRM and only limited platform.
2326000	2333000	As an experiment it's a good idea because I mean it's a way for a company to.
2333000	2342000	I mean basically all these donations are tax write offs anyway whatever they don't make on whatever the retail price of the game is is going to count as a tax write off as a charitable donation.
2342000	2348000	But it's a way to encourage people to give to those who need it.
2349000	2356000	The story goes on to make a point about how the bundle will not help the people that actually made the games in this case.
2356000	2361000	Because a lot of the THQ employees have been laid off since the time this bundle came out.
2361000	2364000	Or I mean since the time these games originally came out.
2364000	2367000	And I'm kind of like alright I get that.
2367000	2371000	That sucks but A THQ is kind of desperate right now.
2371000	2375000	And for what I you know their stock is in the toilet that's no secret.
2375000	2377000	We've had a lot of grim stories about them lately.
2377000	2380000	My understanding is they went to the humble bundle with this idea.
2380000	2384000	And I think with desperate times call for desperate measures.
2384000	2388000	And you've got to do something radical to save your company.
2388000	2391000	Or there won't be any THQ games in the future.
2391000	2395000	And I kind of I applaud the fact that they're taking a risk.
2395000	2400000	And this is a risk around for everybody and I kind of wish more gaming companies would take risks.
2400000	2404000	And it seems to be paying off what three million dollars raised not necessarily all for THQ.
2405000	2408000	But you figure THQ even if they've got a half million of that.
2408000	2412000	Has making way more money than they probably were off these games at this point anyway.
2412000	2415000	And let's be honest I mean they have steam sales all the time.
2415000	2420000	Like you know Saints Row the Third is always being marked down to like ten bucks fifteen bucks or whatever.
2420000	2422000	That's kind of really what I wanted to buy it anyways.
2422000	2425000	I mean yeah cool donate money to everything.
2425000	2428000	But yeah I just wanted Saints Row the Third.
2428000	2430000	Six bucks is a pretty good price for Saints Row the Third.
2430000	2433000	And I get Red Faction Armageddon which was awesome.
2433000	2437000	And also you know Metro 2033.
2437000	2438000	And the other games.
2438000	2439000	And Darksiders.
2439000	2443000	I mean that's just icing on the cake for me.
2443000	2445000	So what?
2445000	2448000	I don't hate the fact that I got a good deal on those games.
2448000	2452000	And the hate on steam for having steam sales in I guess.
2452000	2456000	I mean I don't know why people were just hating on it at all.
2456000	2459000	I gave well over the average actually.
2459000	2463000	I give a bit over the average to get the pack just because I wanted to support it.
2463000	2466000	I kind of wanted to offset some of the negativity I saw on the internet.
2466000	2469000	And I donated the vast majority of it to charity.
2469000	2471000	I gave THQ a dollar and I gave a dollar for the tip.
2471000	2474000	You know because you should always give a dollar to something you support.
2474000	2475000	But I gave the rest to charity.
2475000	2477000	I gave it all to charity.
2477000	2479000	Well and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
2479000	2482000	Also one more thing I want to read out of this story.
2482000	2486000	And again I don't mean to be picking on this but this is just one of those things that I don't get it.
2486000	2492000	Like I think this guy just had a moment of weakness or something or I don't know.
2492000	2494000	Again from the penny arcade report.
2494000	2496000	I'm going to be a hypocrite and buy a bundle.
2496000	2499000	Just because these are incredible games at a staggering low price.
2499000	2502000	But wouldn't it have been something if they were offered without DRM?
2502000	2504000	Or if they ran on Linux?
2504000	2508000	Or if the space was used to promote games that hadn't already sold millions of copies?
2508000	2511000	Yeah that would have been something.
2511000	2514000	But it is what it is.
2514000	2517000	Steam doesn't always put the games I want on sale.
2517000	2522000	Who's to say the humble bundle would have been something maybe I would have been interested in?
2522000	2525000	Maybe it would have been another humble android bundle.
2525000	2527000	Something I can't get any use out of.
2527000	2528000	You know?
2528000	2530000	It is what it is.
2530000	2533000	You buy some and you leave some on the table.
2533000	2540000	Like that speaks to me a little bit like every bundle should be catered to what I want.
2541000	2544000	Well that doesn't sound entitled at all.
2544000	2549000	By the way this is not the first time that Humble Bundle has done a bundle for one company.
2549000	2552000	There was the Humble Frozenbyte Bundle which I bought some time ago.
2552000	2555000	Granted I know. Big difference.
2555000	2557000	Frozenbyte is an indie company. Very different type of thing.
2557000	2559000	But I just wanted to put that out there.
2559000	2563000	It's not unheard of for the Humble Bundle to do a pack dedicated to one company.
2563000	2569000	I think it's a great deal and I would encourage our listeners to check it out and support it.
2569000	2580000	Humblebundle.com. One thing we will not do on this show is give away keys that we bought for 5 cents to the pack of games minus Saints Row the Third.
2580000	2583000	I find that shit to be incredibly tacky.
2583000	2588000	And if you're one of these podcasts that buys keys for I guess really it's a dollar.
2588000	2591000	I shouldn't say a quarter because you have to give a dollar minimum.
2591000	2597000	But if you're one of these podcasts that buys the keys for a dollar just to get your show some cheap promotion and give them away on your show.
2597000	2601000	I'm calling you out. That's fucked up. You're missing the point.
2601000	2606000	You're denying what potentially could be sales for charity.
2606000	2614000	Now it's another thing if you gave $20 or $10 or more and maybe you're including the Saints Row the Third thing.
2614000	2619000	Because then okay you're fronting that kind of money for somebody who may not have the money.
2619000	2625000	But think about it. If you buy it for a dollar and then give it away on your show to somebody who maybe hadn't heard of it yet.
2625000	2632000	Who could have potentially spent $20 on the bundle but now won't because you gave them a key that you bought at bargain basement prices.
2632000	2639000	You have robbed a charity of money for the sake of your own self-promotion. Don't do that.
2639000	2648000	It is different if you buy the whole thing and go I'm not going to play this crap. No I'm kidding.
2648000	2654000	Even then I mean I just I've seen. I'm giving them to Dan. There's a particular play.
2654000	2660000	I saw a show doing it out there and I'm not going to say who that bought five out why not five codes.
2660000	2664000	Well honestly I don't know the name of it because it was something I saw while I was Twitter bouncing.
2664000	2671000	So I don't even remember the name of it but I just kind of I gave it so much stink eye. I'm like oh that's frustrating.
2671000	2681000	Like stop it. All right. Let's see. Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2681000	2690000	Brad from Pod Culture says I always donate 100% to charity. I'm usually not a fan as of much as the gamers but they make a great perk for your donation.
2690000	2695000	I think he means like kind of like the games. So let's see.
2695000	2702000	Actdeft in chat says Darksiders is very well worth this bundle and you can give the Saints Row the third code to anyone you want.
2702000	2706000	So you know you know and I see friends kind of code so that's different.
2706000	2711000	Again friends now that's very very very different because friends aren't doing it for their own self-promotion.
2711000	2722000	So all right. Let's move on. I don't want to focus on the negative but you know when something makes me irritated I'm going to say something about it.
2722000	2728000	I am being a concerned parent right now as the show has been along for far too long. All right. Dark Sakura.
2728000	2736000	Well how about something having to do with an old idea from Sony coming back to bite them in the ass.
2736000	2747000	Well at least in theory. In 2008 they had patented a break apart PS3 controller and nothing happened with it.
2747000	2752000	And it's also not you know the huge space boomerang that was there at E3.
2752000	2768000	Well now they're revisiting the idea with a new patent that I mean it even has it down to the circuit boards and everything and two different versions of it with a regular PlayStation controller with little move bubbles on it which I don't get but OK.
2768000	2780000	And then also it has regular PlayStation handles like controller handles and then really long ones like extra grips.
2780000	2786000	I guess if you're doing move stuff with it so it almost seems to me like they're doing a two handed move controller.
2786000	2791000	You know if I was going to design a controller I'd just make a new negcon.
2792000	2799000	I do like the idea of there being a controller that kind of snaps apart and becomes the move. That's actually kind of rad.
2799000	2802000	It looks completely dumb.
2802000	2804000	If they build it right.
2804000	2805000	It was better designed.
2805000	2814000	Yeah I mean but Sony is not a stranger to going back and redesigning shit that gets received poorly. Remember the boomerang controller everybody.
2814000	2817000	At least that's what I said earlier it's not the space boomerang.
2817000	2825000	Yeah so at least it's not that what do you think Loki about a controller that can break apart and come together and all this looks dumb.
2825000	2834000	It looks dumb only because you know a lot of people aren't interested in the move it's not like oh we need to sell more of these move controllers.
2834000	2840000	I just I don't think the the thing that's keeping people out of the move is not the price point of their controllers.
2840000	2846000	It's that no one wants to play those games which is sad because it's a good controller.
2846000	2852000	It's a it's actually pretty good. To be honest it I think works better than the Kinect.
2852000	2859000	And that's that that's the tragic thing is that in a way the move is really the best motion thing out of all of them.
2859000	2862000	But nobody seems to care.
2862000	2869000	Yeah and there's even some games out there I can't remember the one there's some download title that just came out.
2869000	2874000	It's where you splashing paint with the controllers and like unfinished one.
2874000	2882000	That's it unfinished one. And I'm hearing raves about I haven't played it myself yet because I don't have a move although I hear I just found out like the other day you can do it with controllers.
2882000	2886000	So I need to check it out but I'm hearing raves about that game.
2886000	2897000	And in general the PlayStation Network in general like there's been a lot of great shit on that between Journey which you know is competing for Game of the Year for a reason in a lot of places.
2897000	2909000	And you know the unfinished swan and some of these other games like there's so much great shit on PlayStation that like is not getting noticed like Sony has a marketing problem big time.
2909000	2916000	And it's part of the reason why the move isn't really selling either. I think there is more to the move than the Kinect in many ways.
2916000	2921000	I mean granted the move isn't moving the Kinect has Dance Central which is you know always going to be a fave of mine.
2921000	2929000	But you know it doesn't it doesn't go much past the dancing games for me. But at least the move has some other interesting things.
2929000	2939000	So let's see Tiger Claw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says here's the question what if you lose half of that break apart controller.
2939000	2944000	You wouldn't be able to play with it because the half that's the analog stick and the D pad is missing.
2944000	2951000	Well if you think about it what's the Wii U controller and the nunchuck. That was kind of a break away controller of sorts too.
2951000	2959000	And a lot of times that kind of stood in for your typical controller was the nunchuck and the Wii pad.
2959000	2964000	And if you lost the nunchuck then stupid you shouldn't have lost it. It was kind of that same thing.
2964000	2973000	Cram in our chat room says a boomerang controller would be perfect for all those rage induced controller throws.
2973000	2980000	That is true. The PlayStation was the first console to get well Demon Souls was the first game.
2980000	2988000	Let's see SSG100Matt says I like the boomerang. Some people some people liked it.
2988000	2992000	Well I'll see how much you like it when it comes around to hit you in the head.
2992000	2997000	I don't think it was an actual boomerang. I think the buttons cut out some of the arrow.
2997000	3002000	I bet you anything that if they had marketed that way then someone would have found a way to make it work.
3002000	3005000	Alright let's move on with some more news.
3005000	3012000	Alright so let's talk a little bit about Timesplitters. One of my favorite first person shooter series.
3012000	3020000	And really we need a new game. It's been like a long time. PlayStation 2 since Future Perfect.
3020000	3026000	So now Timesplitters 4 that's been in talks for a while. Back when Free Radical was doing it.
3026000	3031000	And then it was supposed to be being worked on by Crytek and stuff.
3031000	3040000	Well unfortunately the reason it hasn't kind of come out yet is because they haven't been able to find a publisher to actually put it out.
3040000	3046000	And it kind of sucks because Free Radical's last game Haze was kind of crap.
3046000	3052000	And I think Timesplitters 4 would actually be a really great game.
3052000	3058000	They say that it was in very early stages of development when Free Radical went into administration.
3058000	3062000	And they even had a small playable demo that was shown to several publishers.
3062000	3066000	But it didn't attract enough of any publishing deals.
3066000	3072000	And they're also saying that the marketing person. Or actually they're saying. Let's see here.
3072000	3078000	Secondly the marketing person would say something along the lines of I don't know how to sell this.
3078000	3086000	And then the unanimous opinion among all publishers were that they pitched Timesplitters 4.
3086000	3092000	Or I guess it's a game you can't market because it's too diverse a set of characters.
3092000	3097000	Yeah it is kind of hard to explain a game that features exploding monkeys and cats with wheels on them that you race.
3097000	3103000	But at the same time though look at Saints Row the Third. Perfect example.
3103000	3112000	Granted that is a little bit more linear but you've got you know a thing from this crazy Japanese cat character to hitting people with giant purple cocks.
3112000	3119000	So if they can market giant cocks all the time just saying I honestly think I think the game markets itself.
3119000	3123000	You just show this crazy shit and people like cats with wheels. Fuck yes. Sign me up.
3123000	3127000	Or I'm playing a game where I'm shooting people in duck costumes.
3127000	3135000	It's part of part of the reason we got behind President Cat all those years ago is it was something different crazy and seriously just put the game out.
3135000	3145000	It's going to be by understanding that everyone wants to play it really safe because you know new IPs kind of don't do well but take a risk.
3145000	3149000	You have to take risks to succeed. We just talked about. Here's how you do it.
3149000	3154000	You just you put out the HD version of you know the old PlayStation 2 games because you've got three of them.
3154000	3162000	You can do an HD trilogy which people are trying to get a petition going and actually has a lot of signatures on to get that to happen.
3162000	3171000	Then based on the response from that how well that sells then you go decide OK should we move forward with you know putting this out as you know times players for.
3171000	3176000	I think it would do well. I think I mean if they put out an HD version of these games I would buy an RP.
3176000	3183000	It's easy. I mean times where it seriously was a great game. It was one of those games that I actually bought one of the.
3183000	3192000	I forget what the hell they called it but like a multi tap but is basically you know maybe it was all these up you know the four player add on for the PS 2.
3192000	3199000	I bought that for time splitters too. And it was fantastic fun. So I just hope they do it.
3199000	3207000	Somebody put it out or hey you know what free radical I mean or X free radical because I think they're gone.
3207000	3219000	There's all I mean if they have the IP which I don't know who had owns IP right now but if they have the IP there's always Kickstarter and I guarantee that shit we get kick started no problem.
3219000	3225000	All right well speaking of bad management decisions Sega has been pulling some crazy shit on YouTube.
3225000	3233000	They are shutting down channels or I should say excuse me shutting down the videos which could lead to a channel shut down if it happens too many times.
3233000	3240000	Of any type of uploaded video of the Sega Saturn RPG shining force 3.
3240000	3249000	Now it's weird because you know it's not like shining force 3 is this brand it's not an episode of the walking dead that somebody's posting to YouTube.
3249000	3260000	You know it's something that's years old so the question is why now. Well there is a new PSP installment called shining arc that is coming out in Japan in February.
3260000	3269000	Okay so maybe they don't want people searching YouTube to get confused but doesn't that seem a little bit throwing the baby out with the bathwater to somebody.
3270000	3283000	Here's the other crazy thing. Not only were let's play videos thrown out walkthroughs random gameplay clip clips fans talking about shining force were shut down.
3283000	3286000	How is that even possible.
3286000	3297000	Well okay here's how it's possible because Sega is a YouTube partner. They get the little button that allows them to take down you know basically a content thing.
3297000	3302000	No questions asked the content provider has only 24 hours to appeal it that.
3303000	3316000	NBC has these buttons too and so forth and this is what led the internet to rage against Pippa and SOPA and all that stuff because it would have given the government one of these buttons.
3316000	3325000	And you know it would have been open season on not just YouTube. Now granted YouTube has the right to do whatever they want on their turf.
3325000	3335000	You can't claim this is a freedom of speech thing. There would be nothing stopping you from going to Vimeo or whatever unless Sega decides to crack down there too or whatever other site you want to do.
3335000	3343000	But this just seems like a crappy decision on Sega's part especially if this is something to do with shining arc.
3343000	3348000	A game that's not even going to come out in the US or you know so we think so far.
3348000	3358000	I mean so you're going to shut down all the fan channels of this niche game from many years ago to promote your new game. Why?
3358000	3363000	You're just going to ruffle the feathers of the people that will most likely be buying your game.
3363000	3367000	Why wouldn't you want some of the publicity out there and so forth?
3367000	3372000	AcidicVampire wants to know yeah OLR will this be bleeped on the downloaded podcast?
3372000	3379000	No because this podcast isn't a part of YouTube. It's part of VOG Network. We don't have an agreement with Sega.
3379000	3387000	And that is where the government does allow me to say what I want for the purposes of critique.
3387000	3396000	I wouldn't slander Shining Force or slander Sega or so what but I'm entitled to my opinion and my opinion is this is bullshit.
3396000	3404000	And you can't sue me for that. I'm entitled to my opinion. I'm saying it on my own show that I pay for with my own money for the network and so forth and all that.
3404000	3406000	That's freedom of speech.
3406000	3408000	And freedom of the press.
3408000	3409000	Exactly.
3409000	3417000	So there you go. No I know AcidicVampire was teasing but I did want to make that point. He says I was teasing.
3417000	3418000	Wise.
3419000	3420000	So.
3422000	3427000	Yeah a cram in the chat says too. Now Sega is going to shut down OLR for mentioning Shining Force.
3427000	3431000	Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force. Shining Force.
3431000	3435000	Oh and how about this. Fantasy Star. How about some Fantasy Star Rob.
3435000	3436000	I would play.
3436000	3437000	Oppa Oppa.
3437000	3442000	I would play some music from Shining Force but I can't because all the YouTubes have been shut down.
3442000	3444000	Do I happen to have any in my collection?
3444000	3446000	I've got soundtracks at home.
3446000	3447000	I might. You never know.
3447000	3450000	And there's also the soundcloud.
3451000	3453000	Look what I have. Look what I have.
3453000	3454000	Oh see.
3454000	3455000	Look what I have.
3455000	3456000	Look what I have.
3456000	3457000	Let's play it.
3457000	3460000	Alright everybody it's the totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
3466000	3468000	Play that with mailbag.
3468000	3470000	Play that with mailbag.
3470000	3474000	No because I think technically you're only allowed to use 30 seconds for the purposes of 15.
3474000	3481000	As I found out when doing the intro to another show, it's 10% of the song up to 30 seconds.
3481000	3484000	Well we'll cut it off at 23 seconds. There you go.
3484000	3487000	So that song sucked.
3491000	3498000	Just kidding. I don't really think that but I actually like Shining Force. That's the sad thing about it.
3500000	3503000	Totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
3503000	3506000	I have like a bunch of the old Shining Force games.
3506000	3510000	AcidicVampire in chat says, I'm witnessing illegal behavior. Oh my.
3510000	3513000	Frisbee in chat says, Orange Pirate Radio.
3513000	3515000	There you go. Alright.
3515000	3521000	SSG100Matt says, No no no it's only Shining Force 3 guys. Shining Force 1 and 2 don't count.
3522000	3523000	Oh well.
3523000	3526000	Alright anyhow. That was Shining Force Medley by the way.
3528000	3531000	Let's move on to more news.
3531000	3532000	DarkSagra.
3532000	3541000	Well, for anyone who is a fan of The Walking Dead, as we know who was, you know, not listening to Bobby's show and was watching The Walking Dead.
3541000	3542000	Or reading books.
3542000	3549000	Um, The Walking Dead Assault is going to be on iOS and it will be an isometric strategy game.
3549000	3554000	Which, I mean, guarantees I won't be playing it because I hate those kinds of games.
3554000	3557000	However, it's a pretty neat looking game.
3557000	3560000	It's, you know, mostly looks black and white with a few blue elements.
3560000	3563000	And some blood splatter.
3563000	3565000	Oh, there's some green in here.
3565000	3571000	So yeah, it looks like it's mostly black and white with some overlay of various bright colors as effects.
3571000	3574000	But it's, I don't know, it looks kind of neat.
3574000	3578000	But it's supposed to be episodic like the Telltale series.
3579000	3582000	And it's going to follow a new cast.
3582000	3585000	And it's going to be based more on the comic.
3586000	3588000	Quit promoting the competition. Geez.
3588000	3590000	No, I'm just kidding.
3590000	3592000	Get it because the show is on?
3592000	3594000	I hear the game is very, very good.
3594000	3599000	That's on my list of things I need to finish this holiday season is The Walking Dead games.
3599000	3601000	Even though I've never watched the show.
3601000	3604000	But it doesn't matter because the games are based on the books.
3604000	3606000	It's the one common misconception people make.
3607000	3613000	Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and look at some games that are coming out very, very soon.
3613000	3620000	Yes, this week we've got Far Cry 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PC.
3620000	3624000	A few games coming out on the Wii, Rise of the Guardians.
3624000	3626000	Because it was a little bit delayed from the other launch.
3626000	3632000	Family Party, 30 Great Games Obstacle Arcade on the Wii, only for 30 bucks.
3632000	3640000	Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC, Rapalas Probe, Bass Fishing, 2012 on the Wii U.
3640000	3643000	Cavella's Dangerous Hunts, 2013 on the Wii U.
3643000	3647000	Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on the Wii U.
3647000	3650000	Guardians of Middle Earth on PlayStation 3.
3650000	3652000	Fun little voucher there.
3653000	3657000	I like buying digital games in a package.
3657000	3660000	Resistance Collection on the PS3.
3661000	3663000	And what else here?
3663000	3667000	Oh, the Mass Effect trilogy on PS3 finally coming out.
3667000	3669000	Already preordered.
3669000	3671000	You are such a consumer whore.
3671000	3672000	You would have done it too.
3672000	3675000	You know what? No, I wouldn't have because I play on PC.
3675000	3677000	Whatever.
3677000	3679000	Also...
3681000	3685000	I hope the PlayStation 3 version has an extra scene with Garrus.
3685000	3687000	Just to make you mad.
3688000	3691000	And yeah, that's actually it for this week.
3691000	3695000	Almost to the end of games for this year because we only got a couple more weeks before.
3695000	3701000	It's all kind of crap coming out next, but that's it.
3701000	3704000	Alright, well let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.
3704000	3707000	It's a little bit of a different story. It's a busy week in Japan.
3707000	3710000	On the Xbox 360, Saints Row the Third, the full package.
3710000	3715000	I'm assuming that is like the version that has all the DLC and whatever is out in Japan this week.
3715000	3719000	On the PlayStation 3, a couple price reductions for Biohazard Revival Selection.
3719000	3720000	Resident Evil.
3720000	3723000	Devil May Cry HD Collection, probably because of the new one.
3723000	3729000	A new slim console that's Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Emblem Edition.
3729000	3736000	Because Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Yume Kanaishi Mono comes out this week from Sega.
3736000	3738000	And that is on the PlayStation 3.
3738000	3744000	And going to the Vita, nothing this week, but Spy Hunter coming out in Japan next week.
3745000	3748000	I didn't even know that was still a thing that was going on.
3748000	3751000	On the 3DS this week in Japan, Paper Mario Super Seal.
3751000	3754000	I'm hearing good things about that, by the way, here in the States.
3754000	3756000	That's one I haven't looked at, but yeah.
3756000	3760000	Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari 2.
3760000	3764000	Like, what is that? That has nothing to do, like, it's not Pikachu.
3764000	3766000	It's just Pika Pika...
3767000	3769000	I don't know what this is.
3769000	3770000	It's cute!
3770000	3774000	What is she doing? She's like measuring crack on that little scale.
3775000	3777000	Well, that seems like it's pretty self-explanatory.
3777000	3781000	I think it's a vet hospital game, actually, judging from the pets on the calendars.
3781000	3783000	I think it's like a pet hospital game.
3783000	3784000	Maybe.
3784000	3786000	She's a pet pharmacist.
3786000	3789000	And Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3.
3789000	3793000	Taikaizoku to Shippuden on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
3793000	3795000	But it doesn't end there.
3795000	3797000	Know why?
3797000	3800000	Because the Wii U launches on December 8th.
3800000	3801000	That is before our next show.
3801000	3803000	Oh, stop it.
3803000	3804000	The Wii U is great.
3804000	3806000	And we'll be launching in Japan.
3806000	3809000	Of course, just like they did here with the black version and the white version.
3809000	3812000	There's also a set they're going to be launching over there.
3812000	3815000	The Monster Hunter 3G HD Premium set.
3815000	3819000	Because one of their huge launch games is Monster Hunter 3G HD version.
3819000	3822000	That is a game that is launching with the console over there.
3822000	3825000	Otherwise, other games launching in Japan this week for the Wii U.
3825000	3827000	Assassin's Creed 3.
3827000	3830000	Batman Arkham City Armored Edition.
3830000	3834000	FIFA 13 World Class Soccer.
3834000	3837000	Mass Effect 3 Special Edition.
3837000	3839000	Musou Orochi 2 Hyper.
3839000	3841000	New Super Mario Bros. U.
3841000	3843000	Nintendo Land.
3843000	3846000	Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge.
3846000	3849000	Tekken Tag Tournament 2.
3849000	3853000	And I think that's it.
3853000	3855000	Zombie U.
3855000	3859000	Rounding out the launch games over there in Japan.
3860000	3862000	That does it for Japanese release dates.
3862000	3864000	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
3864000	3866000	On the 4th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath.
3866000	3870000	On the 5th, Guardians of Middle Earth and The Critter Chronicles.
3870000	3872000	That's just a cute name.
3872000	3874000	On the 7th, we have Air Conflict Specific Carriers.
3874000	3877000	Mass Effect Trilogy Edition for PS3.
3877000	3880000	And Paper Mario Sticker Star.
3880000	3881000	The end.
3881000	3883000	The end, Rob.
3883000	3884000	Forever. No, I'm kidding.
3884000	3886000	No, we still have two more shows before that.
3886000	3888000	Damn it. Okay.
3888000	3890000	By the way, speaking of all that,
3890000	3893000	Hubbaloo and chat about the world ending on the 21st.
3893000	3895000	Did you know NASA has an official section on their website
3895000	3898000	dedicated to why that whole thing is a farce?
3898000	3900000	And like, the world is not even...
3900000	3904000	But I was reading this fascinating story on Google about how like,
3904000	3907000	like a lot of us kind of are treating it as a joke at this point.
3907000	3909000	Like, yeah, okay, the world's ending again.
3909000	3911000	Because we all went through this, what, just six months ago
3911000	3914000	when that wacko out of the East Bay was talking about, you know,
3914000	3917000	May whatever's Judgment Day, the rapture and all that.
3917000	3921000	But like, some people get seriously emotionally disturbed by this stuff.
3921000	3923000	And I mean, it makes sense.
3923000	3925000	Especially like, younger people really thinking like,
3925000	3928000	the world is gonna end and they get really like, depressed over it.
3928000	3930000	And like, you know, I don't mean to make light of it.
3930000	3932000	Like, it's actually really sad.
3932000	3934000	But it makes me just kind of think like, oh, we shouldn't,
3934000	3936000	shouldn't perpetuate that kind of crap.
3936000	3939000	Because some people really take it like, too far.
3939000	3941000	Like, they're just convinced.
3941000	3943000	Even though NASA has come out and said,
3943000	3946000	look, there is no meteor headed towards Earth.
3946000	3949000	If there was, you could see it in the sky by now.
3949000	3954000	It is not like, like, he's a black meteor.
3954000	3956000	You can't see black on black.
3956000	3961000	Even in Majora's Mask, people, you could see the thing getting bigger
3961000	3963000	as it was coming towards Hyrule.
3963000	3968000	That would be ironic if it was the meteor with the face on it.
3968000	3971000	Anyway, let's move on.
3971000	3973000	A couple more news stories for you guys.
3973000	3974000	And then the classic game of the week.
3974000	3976000	But first, Loki.
3976000	3977000	So this is kind of cool.
3977000	3983000	You know, if you happen to invest in one of the Raspberry Pis,
3983000	3987000	the little pocket sized computer that's like, 35 bucks.
3987000	3990000	You're gonna have a new game that you may be able to run on pretty soon.
3990000	3993000	They're gonna be doing a Pi edition of Minecraft.
3993000	3995000	It's gonna be kind of similar to like, the Pocket edition.
3995000	4000000	Definitely scaled down to run on, you know, such a small computer.
4000000	4002000	With limited processing power.
4002000	4004000	But pretty awesome.
4004000	4006000	And it's gonna be free.
4006000	4008000	So, um, looking forward to that.
4008000	4010000	I actually kind of want to get one of these.
4010000	4012000	They have a huge waiting list.
4012000	4014000	Or at least they did have a huge waiting list.
4014000	4016000	You know, to be able to buy one.
4016000	4019000	And I just, at the time I'm like, what the hell am I gonna do with this?
4019000	4021000	But I still kind of want one.
4021000	4023000	Because it's kind of fun to, you know, mess with.
4023000	4025000	It's a $35 computer.
4025000	4026000	And now it plays Minecraft.
4026000	4029000	So that's even better.
4029000	4031000	Is Minecraft gonna be an Ouya thing?
4031000	4033000	Not to derail too much.
4033000	4034000	Speaking of cheap.
4034000	4036000	Well, here's the thing.
4036000	4038000	Minecraft is already on Android.
4038000	4043000	And granted, Ouya is gonna be supporting stuff through their marketplace.
4043000	4046000	But I would think that it would be able to run.
4046000	4049000	Depending on how they have the buttons mapped for the controllers.
4049000	4053000	If it runs like any of those Bluetooth gamepads.
4053000	4059000	I mean, if you remember, there was a version that was on the Xperia Play.
4059000	4061000	Which is an Android device.
4061000	4064000	And, you know, that ran with controller support.
4064000	4068000	So technically maybe the Pocket Edition would be supported.
4068000	4070000	I would hope that they would have their own version for it.
4070000	4073000	But I don't think it's gonna be something you see at launch.
4073000	4076000	I mean, it's gonna be something that they'd have to, like, adapt to it.
4076000	4080000	Or get, you know, some sort of, you know, not just have to see how popular it is.
4080000	4082000	And then decide to port it over.
4083000	4085000	But, you know, who's to say?
4085000	4094000	It might, you know, run other games that are not, you know, officially supported by Ouya.
4094000	4096000	And it just may run.
4096000	4097000	So, hopefully.
4098000	4101000	Alright, well, Dark Sakura, I don't think I've ever seen one of these in your vault.
4101000	4104000	But, uh, a Vectrex. Do you have one of these in the vault?
4105000	4106000	The Vectrex?
4106000	4107000	No.
4107000	4109000	No? You should get one. They're pretty neat.
4109000	4111000	Even though they were kind of a very, very niche thing.
4111000	4115000	And if you don't know what this is, vector gaming was really big in the 80s.
4115000	4116000	We almost had one.
4116000	4117000	Yeah?
4117000	4118000	Yeah.
4118000	4119000	What stopped you?
4119000	4120000	And they were like, wait, it's a Vectrex.
4121000	4124000	Well, uh, vector gaming was kind of all the rage for a while there.
4124000	4127000	Probably the most well-known vector game would probably be what?
4127000	4128000	Tempest?
4128000	4129000	Actually, Star Wars.
4129000	4130000	Yeah.
4130000	4131000	Remember, the original Star Wars was a vector game.
4131000	4134000	But vector games were also super big on the Atari systems, too.
4134000	4135000	That's true. That's true.
4135000	4139000	Well, a whole system came out dedicated to vector-based games.
4139000	4140000	I had one for a while.
4140000	4142000	Did you really? I remember that. I do.
4142000	4144000	And they were like little tabletop units.
4144000	4145000	Yeah.
4145000	4147000	Right? And they had a game built in.
4147000	4152000	Mindstorm was the built-in game, which was basically Asteroids, but like, you know, that type of thing.
4152000	4154000	But they did release other games to the Vectrex.
4154000	4156000	Well, the Vectrex is coming back of sorts.
4156000	4160000	It's a release called Vectrex Regeneration.
4160000	4165000	It is on the iOS platforms, meaning iPad and iPhone, of course.
4165000	4166000	It's free.
4166000	4169000	So if you want to check it out, it does come with Mindstorm for free.
4169000	4170000	And you can check it out.
4170000	4172000	And I got to say, I was checking it out a little bit before the show.
4172000	4177000	And it's a pretty, you know, for these retro collections, they didn't do a shitty job of it.
4177000	4182000	You know, because sometimes you see these retro collections, they're kind of hack jobs, like they're not very good.
4182000	4185000	But they actually, you know, put in little achievement systems.
4185000	4188000	They have a little cork board in there that you can have your little achievements on.
4188000	4193000	And they have the box arts, the original one that you can fully rotate and, you know, look at.
4193000	4194000	They did a pretty good job.
4194000	4196000	So, you know, hey, it's free. Why not check it out?
4196000	4198000	And you can play Mindstorm.
4198000	4207000	Now, of course, if you want more, 18 other titles from the Vectrex's collection are available for $6.99.
4207000	4208000	Not a bad deal.
4208000	4210000	That also comes with iCade support.
4210000	4212000	I find that interesting that they're paywalling that.
4212000	4214000	Almost got an iCade.
4214000	4215000	Yeah?
4215000	4216000	But still 100 bucks.
4216000	4218000	Like I said earlier, I still kind of want one.
4218000	4219000	I won't win two.
4219000	4221000	Even though it is 100 bucks, I do still kind of want one.
4221000	4224000	Because I just, can you imagine me just plopping it there on the table?
4224000	4225000	Do you know what we found, by the way?
4225000	4231000	We found a little, I think it's like a NES controller thing that hooks onto Android phones.
4231000	4232000	Oh, that's cool.
4232000	4234000	Or like a special type of controller attachment.
4234000	4235000	But it was kind of neat.
4235000	4236000	But it was much cheaper.
4236000	4242000	All 29 games ever released for the system will be added at some point as in-app purchases.
4242000	4244000	What is missing from the app?
4244000	4246000	Actual plastic screen covers.
4246000	4249000	Like you had on the, do you remember you had to take these little screen covers?
4249000	4251000	You know what was missing on my Vectrex?
4251000	4253000	Actual plastic screen covers.
4253000	4254000	Oh, yeah.
4254000	4255000	You didn't have those?
4255000	4256000	No.
4256000	4257000	I mean, you can play Mindstorm without one, but...
4257000	4258000	You can play all of them without them.
4258000	4262000	I mean, I'm sure that the games have like some sort of overlay.
4262000	4263000	Yeah.
4263000	4264000	Oh, no, no.
4264000	4265000	Yeah.
4265000	4266000	Of course.
4266000	4267000	Yeah.
4267000	4268000	In the app, obviously.
4268000	4269000	How hard is it with modern technology?
4269000	4270000	Just draw the plastic on top of it.
4270000	4271000	But it still looked kind of neat.
4271000	4272000	I like that.
4272000	4273000	So check that out.
4273000	4275000	Just search for Vectrex in the app store.
4275000	4278000	V-E-C-T-R-E-X.
4278000	4283000	A little shout-out for those guys at Rant Media Games who've made that.
4283000	4284000	All right.
4284000	4288000	Let's, hey, what a great lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.
4292000	4297000	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the vault, so you know it won't be a Vectrex game.
4297000	4302000	But she's going to pick a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be playing this game.
4302000	4304000	You better recognize.
4304000	4306000	How about you better recognize her?
4306000	4307000	Ooh, is it Tron?
4307000	4308000	Did you pick Tron as the Classic Game of the Week?
4308000	4309000	No, I didn't.
4309000	4310000	Oh.
4310000	4311000	Dan picks the game again.
4311000	4312000	Again?
4312000	4314000	Yeah, but I have a reason for this one.
4314000	4315000	All right.
4315000	4316000	What is the Classic Game of the Week?
4316000	4317000	The Golden Axe.
4317000	4318000	I have not done Golden Axe.
4318000	4319000	Wow.
4319000	4322000	I should have done Shining Force.
4322000	4324000	You really should have, but that's okay.
4324000	4325000	Yeah.
4325000	4326000	All right.
4326000	4327000	So Golden Axe is the Classic Game of the Week.
4327000	4331000	Oh, man, Rob, your contrast is like way crazy on your computer.
4331000	4332000	I'm sorry.
4332000	4333000	We've all had those.
4333000	4334000	Stop the stupid ads.
4334000	4335000	I know.
4335000	4336000	That's all right.
4336000	4342000	But Golden Axe is a game that was primarily developed by Makoto Uchida.
4342000	4346000	And it's a side-scrolling hack and slash video game.
4346000	4347000	Pow!
4347000	4355000	Done in 1989 for the, um, actually System 16B arcade hardware.
4355000	4361000	And, of course, it came out on the Genesis and Master System much later.
4361000	4365000	It's sort of a Conan the Barbarian type of game.
4365000	4367000	The high fantasy medieval world.
4367000	4372000	And you play as one of three characters who are getting revenge on Death Adder.
4372000	4373000	What a great name.
4373000	4376000	Of course, I always laugh at the later ones because we have Death Adder Jr.
4376000	4377000	That just makes me laugh.
4377000	4380000	Hi, I'm going to name you Death Adder Jr.
4380000	4382000	Um, so you...
4382000	4383000	Why not?
4383000	4385000	If I have a kid, I think Rob Roberts Jr. would be a great name.
4385000	4386000	Don't you?
4386000	4388000	I thought you had a different one in mind.
4388000	4389000	Yeah, but we can't get into it.
4389000	4390000	I know.
4390000	4391000	I'm not saying it.
4391000	4397000	Um, anyway, the first character you have is a dwarf that wields a battle axe called Gilius Thunderhead.
4397000	4399000	Which is just an awesome name.
4399000	4401000	And it's a golden axe.
4401000	4405000	Yes, but the actual golden axe is in the possession of Death Adder.
4405000	4406000	What?
4406000	4409000	Who tries to use it to kill you to death.
4409000	4411000	Um, there's also a male barbarian.
4411000	4413000	And, Rob, this is an even better name.
4413000	4417000	Um, the guy's name is Axe Battler.
4417000	4419000	Yeah, Axe Battler.
4419000	4425000	It just sounds to me like it would be, you know, um, something from like a re-dubbed anime.
4425000	4429000	That was like, sort of like, you know, Voltron or something.
4429000	4432000	Um, and then you, uh, have, he uses a broadsword by the way.
4432000	4435000	And he's trying to avenge the murder of his mother.
4435000	4440000	And Gilius is trying to avenge the death of his brother.
4440000	4444000	And then you have the redhead lady, uh, Tyrus Flare.
4444000	4445000	Who is an Amazon.
4445000	4447000	And her parents were killed by Death Adder.
4447000	4449000	Death Adder is a bastard.
4449000	4451000	He's just a dirty bitch.
4451000	4455000	Um, so anyway, they, uh, go to rescue everyone from Turtle Village.
4455000	4457000	Which actually turns out to be on a turtle.
4457000	4459000	And the turtle takes them across the sea.
4459000	4462000	And then they go to the castle in the back of a giant eagle.
4462000	4464000	And then they beat Death Adder to death.
4464000	4466000	You know, how ironic.
4466000	4470000	And it turns out his daddy, Deathbringer, is the real final boss in the Genesis version.
4470000	4473000	And then they get the golden axe and they're immortal like forever.
4474000	4479000	So, um, it's, you've got like different, um, capabilities with them.
4479000	4485000	For example, the dwarf is strongest on weapon but weakest on, um, spell power.
4485000	4490000	Where the, uh, Amazon is strongest on spell power but weakest on sword power.
4490000	4494000	And then the regular, you know, dude's like, look at my chest.
4494000	4496000	And he's all average.
4496000	4501000	Oh, I love the artwork for this because it looks like seriously something straight off of a D&D cover.
4502000	4510000	Um, but anyway, um, the, uh, the producer was super, you know, fond of the action movies.
4510000	4512000	Especially the Conan ones.
4512000	4516000	So that's why he, uh, you know, basically made the game in this theme.
4516000	4519000	And there's all kinds of other versions of it.
4519000	4523000	There was the Mega Drive slash Genesis version that was very faithful to the arcade version.
4523000	4527000	With an extra level of place you can kill Death Adder's daddy.
4527000	4529000	And we've got the, uh...
4529000	4534000	This is my favorite part, kicking the shit out of those little gnomes that had the potions.
4534000	4535000	Yeah.
4535000	4536000	Sorry.
4536000	4538000	And then, um...
4540000	4546000	There was, uh, the, uh, Sega CD one that was a Sega Classics arcade that had Redbook audio music and voiceovers.
4546000	4549000	Um, there was a virtual console version.
4549000	4553000	There was the Sega Smash Pack, the Genesis Collection, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.
4553000	4557000	Um, there's a version on PlayStation Plus for free.
4557000	4564000	Um, there were also PC versions that came out that had a 256 color palette in VGA mode.
4564000	4566000	And it could run it in EGA mode as well.
4566000	4569000	And a CGA and 2 color mode.
4569000	4571000	Which, why would you want to play it in 2 color?
4571000	4574000	You haven't lived until you've played Golden Axe in CGA.
4574000	4575000	Anyway.
4575000	4577000	But which color palette was it?
4577000	4578000	Was it the...
4578000	4580000	I'm pretty sure it was the CMYK.
4580000	4582000	Not the RGB, yeah.
4582000	4587000	Which is very funny since, um, monitors are built for RGB.
4587000	4588000	Actually, whoops, I'm sorry.
4588000	4591000	No, the other palette wasn't RGB, it was RGY.
4591000	4594000	Blue was only in the CMYK palette.
4594000	4595000	CMY.
4595000	4596000	No, it wasn't even CMY.
4596000	4598000	God, I can't get it right.
4598000	4600000	CMYK is for print only.
4600000	4604000	No, it was, it was, it was not, it was white.
4604000	4605000	Not black.
4605000	4606000	Yes.
4606000	4608000	Syma, Genta, uh, white and black.
4608000	4610000	And then the other one was...
4610000	4611000	The CMWK?
4611000	4613000	Uh, red, green, yellow, and black.
4613000	4614000	Yeah, that was it.
4614000	4615000	Okay.
4615000	4616000	Anyway.
4616000	4618000	Thank you for the history lesson.
4618000	4619000	Color theory.
4619000	4620000	Mr. Loki.
4620000	4626000	The ZX Spectrum, um, and the Commodore 64 versions also were rather limited.
4626000	4630000	Um, there, like I said, there were different things added.
4630000	4635000	The Master System version, um, retold the story from the perspective of the Axe Battler
4635000	4637000	who was called Tarek in that game.
4637000	4639000	And it's only one player.
4639000	4643000	Um, Golden Axe was also released by, um, Telnet for the PC Engine.
4643000	4648000	And it was, like, super resampled music, cut scenes, you name it.
4648000	4651000	It's a very, very freaking good version of that game.
4651000	4652000	Um.
4652000	4656000	Sorry for the, uh, cut fact that the music cut out, but I, I'm trying to find a YouTube
4656000	4664000	clip of Golden Axe CGA, because I found a YouTube clip of 39 DOS retro games in CGA.
4664000	4665000	Dude.
4665000	4666000	I saw the Deanna Jones.
4666000	4668000	I didn't even know they had DuckTales in CGA.
4668000	4669000	Dude, dude.
4669000	4672000	Oh, God, it was purple.
4672000	4675000	Well, I will continue while Rob's looking for that.
4675000	4680000	Um, there was also a handheld TV game of the arcade legend Sega Genesis Volume 1, and an
4680000	4684000	enhanced remake that came out on PS2 as part of the Sega Ages line, which we came close
4684000	4685000	to getting.
4685000	4687000	Was the skater die guy supposed to be Rodney Dangerfield?
4687000	4688000	Because I swear to God.
4688000	4690000	I swear to God it's Rodney Dangerfield.
4690000	4691000	No respect.
4691000	4692000	Alright, never mind.
4692000	4693000	Okay.
4693000	4696000	Sorry, I didn't mean to derail with another game, but it was an important question that
4696000	4697000	had to be asked.
4697000	4698000	I will give you, um.
4698000	4699000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
4699000	4700000	You found it?
4700000	4701000	Here's the answer.
4701000	4705000	It is the, it is the red, green, yellow, black palette.
4705000	4706000	There is Golden Axe.
4706000	4708000	It doesn't look too terrible for what it is.
4708000	4709000	In all your studying.
4709000	4711000	Oh, that's not the actual audio.
4711000	4712000	That's just from the video.
4712000	4713000	But there is Golden Axe.
4713000	4715000	I was gonna say, that actually looks, that doesn't look that bad.
4715000	4716000	Yeah.
4716000	4718000	They did some pretty crazy shit with four colors back in the day.
4718000	4719000	Damn.
4719000	4720000	You should see strip poker CGA.
4720000	4721000	I have.
4721000	4722000	Oh, Lord.
4722000	4723000	Of course you have.
4723000	4726000	Well, here's a little factoid with my history with this game.
4726000	4731000	The second game I ever played on the Sega Saturn, Rob, was Golden Axe, the duel.
4731000	4732000	Wow.
4732000	4734000	You know, the first game I played was?
4734000	4738000	It's a crappy Gundam game that came out, my friend imported.
4738000	4739000	So, anyway.
4739000	4740000	There you go.
4740000	4741000	Best classic game.
4741000	4742000	Golden Axe.
4742000	4743000	Awesome.
4743000	4744000	Pow.
4744000	4746000	Sorry, now I'm looking up.
4746000	4748000	Oh my God.
4748000	4749000	Rob.
4749000	4751000	It's strip poker on the Commodore 64.
4751000	4754000	Oh my God, Rob.
4754000	4756000	You need to put that porn away.
4756000	4758000	Some of those strip poker games may have for shareware.
4758000	4759000	Oh my God.
4759000	4762000	Somebody should flag this video for being disgusting.
4762000	4763000	Hey, I see some bush.
4763000	4764000	Exactly.
4764000	4765000	Four colors.
4765000	4767000	I mean, serious.
4767000	4770000	Oh, the 80s.
4770000	4773000	I don't know why it's so funny.
4773000	4775000	Oh, I know exactly why it's so funny.
4775000	4779000	Rob, do you find pubes really funny?
4779000	4785000	Well, no, I'm laughing because it just happened to be at the moment I was looking at the video,
4785000	4789000	it said, my hand, because, you know, as in a poker reference, but then I'm like, her
4789000	4791000	hand looks like it's in her butt.
4791000	4794000	She's getting herself ready.
4794000	4795000	You shouldn't be calling it.
4795000	4798000	In fact, I will actually post that and see.
4798000	4800000	Alpha Kinanogram is demanding links.
4800000	4801000	There you go in the chat room.
4801000	4802000	There you go.
4802000	4803000	Strip poker.
4803000	4804000	Since we're on the illegal episode of Orange on the Radio.
4804000	4807000	Strip poker in all its Commodore 64 glory.
4807000	4812000	We'll share porn with the kids too.
4812000	4816000	Sorry, I'm also asking Rama to tumble this with a parental advisory.
4816000	4820000	Good Lord.
4820000	4822000	All right.
4822000	4824000	Here we go.
4824000	4825000	Moving on.
4825000	4826000	That's it for part A.
4826000	4830000	We need to take a break and clean up our act.
4830000	4835000	It's a very dirty illegal show tonight, but there's plenty more to come in part B.
4835000	4837000	We've got more Wii U to talk about.
4837000	4843000	We're going to talk about sales figures over Black Light Friday, Black Friday, and more
4843000	4849000	news on Ouya and some Nintendo rumors when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4849000	4857000	right after this.
4857000	4860000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4860000	4866000	Live on this December the 2nd of 2012 with the 484th episode of our podcast.
4866000	4868000	We're going to hit 500 early next year.
4868000	4869000	Can you believe it?
4869000	4872000	We need to plan something special, like for real this time.
4872000	4876000	Like even bigger than our 10th anniversary show, which was just like people visiting
4876000	4878000	from far away coming to see the show.
4878000	4881000	We need to plan something huge for our 500th episode.
4881000	4886000	I don't know what, but something that can be done on a very low budget.
4887000	4890000	We'll have to throw ourselves a party at Chuck E. Cheese.
4890000	4892000	That's about what can fit in the budget.
4892000	4898000	How will THQ bundle scene codes for everyone?
4898000	4900000	Resell keys to the bundle.
4900000	4901000	No, that's terrible.
4901000	4902000	That's awful.
4902000	4904000	How dare you even suggest that?
4904000	4905000	We'll figure something out.
4905000	4907000	OLR Kickstarter for OLR Con.
4907000	4909000	No, I don't know.
4909000	4913000	I guess it would be more appropriate to have the party at Roseville Golf Land.
4913000	4918000	Did you know that the other night, um, you know, Saturday night was kind of a blood day,
4918000	4921000	but there was a break in the storms and Alan and I were kind of going,
4921000	4922000	what should we do?
4922000	4923000	Should we even go do something?
4923000	4924000	What do you want to do?
4924000	4927000	And it was actually suggested, should we go to Roseville Golf Land?
4927000	4930000	And we were like, what would we do?
4930000	4934000	We're going to drive all the way out there and play what?
4934000	4937000	Like there's not that many great arcade games anymore.
4937000	4940000	I guess we could have driven to that bowling alley in Rockland.
4940000	4941000	That's got some stuff.
4941000	4942000	I like them, but
4942000	4944000	Blood strikes or whatever it's called.
4944000	4948000	At least the last time I was there, they had some interesting things, but whatever.
4948000	4949000	Uh, all right.
4949000	4951000	We'll figure something out.
4951000	4952000	Uh, yep.
4952000	4954000	But no breaks in the near future coming.
4954000	4959000	As far as we know, we're going to keep doing an episode every week on into 2013.
4959000	4962000	Assuming, of course, the world does not end in a couple of weeks,
4962000	4963000	although we all know it won't.
4963000	4964000	Come on.
4964000	4966000	The media needs something to report on.
4966000	4968000	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.
4968000	4969000	Loki.
4969000	4970000	All right.
4970000	4974000	So let's talk about something I mentioned during my gaming week,
4974000	4976000	which is Skrillex.
4976000	4978000	Skrillex?
4978000	4979000	Crest.
4979000	4982000	I swear, that's like a tongue twister for me.
4982000	4985000	It's basically kind of a combination of a bunch of different things.
4985000	4988000	Retro, like NES games.
4988000	4992000	Because the whole thing, the premise of it is that there's this piece of dust
4992000	4995000	that falls onto an NES cartridge,
4995000	5000000	and it's what happens when that dust corrupts everything in the game.
5000000	5004000	And so you're completing this, uh, link type character
5004000	5008000	that's kind of done in this, you know, sword and sorcery type art.
5008000	5013000	And you're fighting glitches that are in the game
5013000	5016000	and trying to save this sort of princess thing.
5016000	5019000	And it's pretty cool.
5019000	5020000	It's a free game.
5020000	5025000	You can check it out on their website.
5025000	5028000	Which, let's see here.
5028000	5030000	I don't remember the hell it is.
5030000	5033000	But, um, it's pretty cool.
5033000	5036000	It's done by, like I said, the guy that did the Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now game,
5036000	5038000	the Perfect Strangers one, Jason Oda.
5038000	5042000	He kind of specializes in Adver games.
5042000	5045000	And, yes, so check this out.
5045000	5048000	It's SkrillexQuest.com.
5048000	5050000	It's pretty easy to find that.
5050000	5057000	Another kind of indie game that's getting a really unasked for sequel,
5057000	5062000	uh, Barclay's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden
5062000	5069000	is getting the sequel entitled The Magical Realms of Tirnaa Nog,
5069000	5074000	Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of C'thulun,
5074000	5077000	and the official game of the movie,
5077000	5081000	chapter two of the Hoops Barclay saga,
5081000	5083000	or Barclay 2 for short.
5083000	5085000	It's being Kickstarted right now.
5085000	5088000	And to be honest, I mean, I remember seeing some of the stuff
5088000	5090000	for Barclay's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden,
5090000	5092000	and this looks nothing like it.
5092000	5095000	It just looks like kind of this weird cyberpunk game.
5095000	5099000	Um, and they're looking for $35,000 on Kickstarter,
5099000	5102000	and some of the bonuses include all sorts of weird things,
5102000	5104000	including a cyberdwarf body pillow,
5104000	5108000	and of course, you know, game downloads, soundtrack, and that kind of stuff.
5108000	5110000	So that's interesting.
5110000	5115000	And then last but not least, Dishonored doing pretty well in retail market.
5115000	5118000	Their sales have exceeded the expectations of Bethesda,
5118000	5122000	so I guess that means we're going to see another series of games,
5122000	5126000	or another franchise from Bethesda, which is fine.
5126000	5128000	I think it was a pretty awesome game.
5128000	5134000	Apparently, it sold 460,000 copies in North America during October.
5134000	5138000	And of course, the sales figures, I think, for November,
5138000	5141000	obviously haven't been released yet, because we just got into December.
5141000	5143000	So we'll have to see what it did, you know,
5143000	5146000	competing up against Assassin's Creed and...
5146000	5150000	Well, actually, I guess we saw a little bit of Assassin's Creed sales in there,
5150000	5156000	but, you know, more Assassin's Creed 3 sales in Halo 4 and Black Ops 2.
5156000	5158000	Yeah.
5158000	5160000	All right, well, moving on to a game I talked about last week,
5160000	5163000	Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed.
5163000	5166000	It's going to be a game that's going to get a patch on the Wii U.
5166000	5169000	The Wii U version of the game is borked right now.
5169000	5171000	You'll know that if you've tried to beat the boost challenge.
5171000	5173000	It is pretty much impossible to beat.
5173000	5175000	I guess if you're, like, superhuman, you can beat it.
5175000	5178000	But, yeah, some boost pads that are supposed to be there,
5178000	5181000	that are there in the other versions of the game, not there.
5181000	5183000	No wonder I couldn't beat it when I played it.
5183000	5184000	I was like, this is too hard.
5184000	5187000	And I thought maybe I needed to do more drifting to get those boosts,
5187000	5190000	but I guess there really was a bug.
5190000	5194000	So the patch has already been sent to Nintendo for review.
5194000	5196000	So I'm assuming that means it will be out very soon.
5196000	5198000	You just weren't snaking enough.
5198000	5201000	I guess not, which, technically, I don't know if that's something you can do.
5201000	5203000	I mean, you can't do it to the level.
5203000	5205000	You can do it in Mario Kart, but it's possible.
5205000	5209000	Also, speaking of Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed,
5209000	5211000	there is going to be DLC for the game at some point,
5211000	5214000	especially, we know, on 360 and PlayStation 3 versus the game.
5214000	5219000	But folks in the community were throwing out ideas for DLC,
5219000	5223000	and executive producer Steve Lysett with Sumo Digital,
5223000	5225000	who made the game, put out a challenge.
5225000	5228000	Quote, without any policing from the Sumo or Sega crew,
5228000	5232000	if you can all agree on three characters by the first of December
5232000	5238000	and prove there is sufficient interest of at least 1,000 unique people per character,
5238000	5242000	I will present the result to Sega, the fans delivered,
5242000	5246000	separate change.org petitions for the following characters
5246000	5248000	for these three current leaders.
5248000	5252000	Hatsune Miku, Project D.Va, that's a great choice.
5252000	5258000	Ryo Hazuki, from Shenmue, no surprise there.
5258000	5266000	Segata Sanshiro, the Sega Saturn mascot, if you weren't already aware.
5266000	5269000	No guarantees that those three characters will be included,
5269000	5271000	but those are some pretty bitchin' choices.
5271000	5275000	I hope that they do include Ryo, that they include him driving a forklift.
5278000	5280000	I hope when he takes somebody out, he'll be,
5280000	5284000	there's your game of Lucky Hit, asshole.
5284000	5285000	Moving on to some other...
5285000	5288000	I want to see, like, Echo the Dolphin or something like that.
5288000	5295000	Some ridiculous that just won't work, you know, or, I don't know.
5295000	5298000	Do they have ToeJam and Earl in there?
5298000	5299000	I don't think so.
5299000	5301000	There's still a lot of great Sega characters they could use.
5301000	5304000	But anyway, moving on to other Nintendo news about the Wii U.
5304000	5307000	In an interview with IGN, Satoru Iwata said,
5307000	5310000	you know what, we're not interested in emulating online services
5310000	5312000	like Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.
5312000	5314000	Here we go again with that whole, we gotta be different.
5314000	5316000	The jokes write themselves.
5316000	5319000	Let me read the quote, then you make the joke.
5319000	5322000	We have not thought that offering the same features that already exist
5322000	5324000	within other online communities would be the best proposal
5324000	5326000	for very experienced game players.
5326000	5329000	Nintendo has paid a great deal of attention to the dynamic
5329000	5332000	of people playing video games together in the same room.
5332000	5335000	With Wii U, we thought about expanding this concept into separate rooms,
5335000	5337000	which are connected online.
5337000	5339000	Miiverse is a network community dedicated to video games
5339000	5343000	that represents a very unique game-dedicated social graph
5343000	5345000	that has never existed before.
5345000	5348000	All right, although I think about half that statement
5348000	5350000	as the typical blowing-smoke-up-my-ass stuff
5350000	5352000	that you get in the PR speak world,
5352000	5356000	you do have to admit Miiverse is something different.
5356000	5360000	It is not done on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.
5360000	5361000	It is different.
5361000	5363000	I think you totally missed the whole underlying statement here
5363000	5365000	that they've totally put forth.
5365000	5368000	They want you to buy one for each member of your family.
5368000	5371000	That's why there's only one game pad for that console.
5371000	5373000	It's because each member of your family should own one
5373000	5375000	in their own separate rooms.
5375000	5377000	That's right, and they'll connect via the internet.
5377000	5379000	Don't you know that's why the Wii Mini exists?
5379000	5382000	The Canadian Wii Mini so that every kid's bedroom can have one.
5382000	5385000	But it can't be connected to each other because...
5385000	5388000	It doesn't matter. Shut up and go play Wii Sports.
5388000	5390000	Go to your room. Okay.
5390000	5392000	Why would I play a game that came out with the Wii?
5392000	5396000	It's not like it's Super Mario Brothers or something like that.
5396000	5398000	You know, a game that actually is awesome.
5398000	5400000	Shut up and go play Wii Fit.
5400000	5404000	I'm sorry. That game's terrible.
5404000	5406000	Wasn't there supposed to be a Wii Fit U?
5406000	5408000	Yeah, there is.
5408000	5409000	Where is it?
5409000	5412000	Launch Window. Remember, they still have six more years.
5412000	5414000	Excuse me.
5414000	5416000	Launch Window is such bullshit.
5416000	5418000	Launch Window should be that week that's coming out.
5418000	5420000	You know, if it launches on Sunday...
5420000	5422000	Hey, I understand that all games are not going to be free on Sunday.
5422000	5426000	Like a month. From launch to Christmas would have been Launch Window to me.
5426000	5431000	Launch Window is not fucking your fiscal year that the launch happens to take place in.
5431000	5437000	That's like calling a hole blown into your wall that's the entire site of your house.
5437000	5440000	That's the Launch Window for investors only.
5440000	5442000	The people that Nintendo's really trying to speak to.
5442000	5445000	That's like calling the wall missing in a dollhouse a window.
5445000	5449000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
5449000	5451000	Miiverse is very unique. I think it's cool.
5451000	5453000	People can write and stuff directly from the gamepad.
5453000	5456000	However, if I had it, I wouldn't be able to draw on it.
5456000	5459000	I can't draw Jack's shit, only stick figures.
5459000	5463000	Yeah, I gotta admit, the whole Miiverse thing, as much as I do love it,
5463000	5465000	I think it's great and the community element and so forth,
5465000	5468000	it really reminds me how bad of a drawer I am.
5468000	5474000	I tried to draw one for one of the levels I beat in Mario and it's just, it's not, it's not good.
5474000	5477000	I'm not a good artist at all.
5477000	5481000	And the Wii U makes me feel insignificant.
5481000	5486000	You know, I think this is going to be very popular until it goes away,
5486000	5490000	a Pictochat where everyone just kind of like, I'm over it.
5490000	5493000	I can't believe internet Pictochat's not a thing, but I guess Nintendo can't please that.
5493000	5494000	That would be awesome.
5494000	5496000	Penises everywhere.
5496000	5498000	Think about the children.
5498000	5502000	One of the places Nintendo was getting slammed with the launch of the Wii U console
5502000	5505000	was that you can't really move your Nintendo network account.
5505000	5507000	Well, some clarity's come forth this week.
5507000	5512000	Through somebody who sent their bricked Wii U system into Nintendo,
5512000	5517000	Nintendo in turn sent them back a brand new console that was allowing them to sign in
5517000	5519000	to their previously made Nintendo network account.
5519000	5520000	So there's the answer.
5520000	5523000	If you want to move your Nintendo ID from one console to another,
5523000	5526000	just send it in to Nintendo. They'll do it for you.
5526000	5527000	That's cost effective.
5527000	5530000	I'm assuming, especially if they launch Wii U.
5530000	5532000	That's the way they do it with the Wii.
5532000	5536000	If they, when they launch Wii U's in other colors and other shapes and all this other stuff,
5536000	5538000	there'll be a way to do it in the future.
5538000	5541000	There'll be a, a move me channel or something.
5541000	5542000	It's just stupid.
5542000	5543000	It is a little ridiculous.
5543000	5545000	It's just like, hey, features that are helpful.
5545000	5547000	Ah, fuck that. We're different.
5547000	5551000	We, we don't want to emulate the guys that actually have functioning online services.
5551000	5553000	We're just gonna, we're gonna wing it.
5553000	5555000	It's our, we're gonna wing it.
5555000	5559000	We're gonna try to create something that's more like, you know, social and stuff.
5559000	5560000	Oh, patches?
5560000	5565000	Well, uh, uh, online connectivity?
5565000	5568000	Uh, well, um, yeah.
5568000	5569000	I don't know.
5572000	5574000	Alright, Bobby in our chat room by Black Wolf says,
5574000	5576000	I drew something that said I couldn't draw.
5576000	5577000	I got Yaz for it.
5577000	5582000	My stick figure flipped a table and a stick kitty told me to please be reasonable with the table.
5582000	5584000	I haven't seen that drawing yet.
5584000	5585000	I need to log on to Miiverse.
5585000	5587000	Alright, uh, let's move on.
5587000	5588000	Dark Sakura.
5590000	5591000	Uh, hold on.
5591000	5592000	Okay, there we go.
5592000	5593000	Well, uh-
5593000	5594000	Hold on to what?
5594000	5595000	Shush.
5595000	5599000	The new Super Mario Bros. 2 is getting Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 levels
5599000	5601000	and they are available now.
5602000	5608000	They are through, uh, it looks like free Coin Rush content and is now available to download.
5608000	5610000	So, that's good for people who have that.
5610000	5612000	Yay for DLC, right?
5612000	5614000	After that, it's gonna be $250.
5614000	5621000	Then, um, for the Vita, there is going to be, um, a PlayStation Plus, uh, bundle.
5621000	5628000	So, it's gonna be $300 and, um, it will have the PlayStation Plus Instant Game collection
5628000	5635000	and it will be a black 3G Wi-Fi Vita, a year of Plus, and a voucher for download of Unit 13
5635000	5637000	and a 4GB memory card.
5637000	5642000	And last, uh, but not least, um, Stern is bringing out Avengers Pinball.
5642000	5643000	Yay.
5643000	5649000	Which, I mean, we all saw that coming anyway because Stern is basically the only releaser of pinball games now.
5649000	5652000	But, hey, it will, uh, hopefully be a good table.
5652000	5654000	I'll keep my fingers crossed.
5655000	5659000	Alright, let's go to the FUGL Question of the Week.
5659000	5661000	It's my vehicle.
5666000	5671000	Facebook plus Google. Slam them together and you get FUGL.
5671000	5675000	And, uh, we ask a question on our social network communities every week.
5675000	5677000	This week is the following.
5677000	5679000	What is on your gamer's Christmas list?
5679000	5682000	Or Hanukkah, Festivus, whatever it is you observe.
5682000	5685000	So, that's it. Pretty simple question with the holidays coming up.
5685000	5689000	We want to know what people are asking for from Santa Claus and Hanukkah Harry
5689000	5692000	and their Festivus poll and the moon or whatever it is.
5692000	5695000	So, starting off with some of the answers from Facebook.
5695000	5697000	We have a lot of answers tonight. I can't read them all.
5697000	5701000	I'm going to read some of the names I don't usually see in chat.
5701000	5703000	Uh, Dart Charger says,
5703000	5709000	While I wasn't quite willing to pull the trigger myself, I wouldn't mind if Santa put a Wii U under the tree.
5710000	5712000	I'm not going to buy a Wii U.
5712000	5714000	James S. replied and said,
5714000	5717000	I have my eye on PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,
5717000	5721000	but other than that, I believe next year will be exponentially better.
5721000	5725000	Possibly even new consoles from Sony and Microsoft.
5725000	5728000	You know, we didn't get into it in tonight's news. We're not going to.
5728000	5734000	But, uh, the Microsoft rumors were taken off again about the new console.
5734000	5737000	Like, it even showed up on my Google News feed.
5737000	5742000	Uh, just more rumors about Microsoft launching in Holiday 2013.
5742000	5744000	And I almost kind of thought that was a given.
5744000	5746000	I don't know why it suddenly got a little...
5746000	5748000	It's just someone else saying the same thing again.
5748000	5750000	Investors picking up on it.
5750000	5752000	Oh, we think they're going to...
5752000	5756000	We're an analyst and we think that they're going to launch a new console, you know, next year.
5756000	5759000	Cool. You know, if I say that, no one fucking cares.
5759000	5762000	Here's the part that surprised me about that story.
5762000	5767000	The part that was news and interesting is that they may not unveil it at E3.
5767000	5769000	They may do their own event.
5769000	5772000	Which, it makes sense. Why not?
5772000	5774000	They can get away with it. Nintendo does it.
5774000	5778000	I mean, they do E3, but instead of Tokyo Game Show, they do their own thing.
5778000	5780000	Why shouldn't Microsoft do their own thing?
5780000	5786000	I actually think that's a great idea, actually, as long as it's before E3.
5786000	5791000	Because unveil the console before E3 and then make E3 about...
5791000	5793000	What, everybody? What? What?
5793000	5794000	The games.
5794000	5796000	Xbox Live. No.
5796000	5798000	Halo 5?
5798000	5802000	I would love that. I would love it if E3 could actually be about the game.
5802000	5804000	So, alright.
5804000	5807000	Oop, I guess the music was too loud in that previous segment.
5807000	5811000	Sorry, I thought it was at its usual volume. My bad.
5811000	5813000	Live radio, it's fun.
5813000	5815000	I heard myself. Alright.
5815000	5817000	Let's see.
5817000	5819000	Burr replied and said,
5819000	5824000	I'm terrible in that I've already bought everything I wanted for myself, like a Wii U and whatnot.
5824000	5829000	I would love a Steam sale on Borderlands 2 DLC or Mass Effect 3 DLC, however.
5829000	5835000	Yeah, I mean, that's the thing about growing up, is that you kind of end up buying yourself all the stuff you want.
5835000	5838000	Like, I bought myself a Wii U. That was kind of my early Christmas present to myself.
5838000	5841000	I'm not really expecting anything else from anyone.
5841000	5845000	You know, I wanted it. I bought it. Happy holidays.
5845000	5848000	Degenerate Johnny said,
5848000	5851000	To be honest, I've been pretty disappointed with this fall's lineup of games.
5851000	5855000	Therefore, my holiday list will consist of paid-off pre-orders of next year's games,
5855000	5859000	such as Dead Space 3, as well as BioShock Infinite.
5859000	5862000	Tiara from Geek-Life.com said,
5862000	5865000	I need the new Skyrim DLC, Dragonborn.
5865000	5869000	No, really. I need it. For reasons.
5869000	5871000	Let's see.
5871000	5873000	Critical Myth replied and said,
5873000	5877000	Assassin's Creed 3, PlayStation Vita with Assassin's Creed Liberation,
5877000	5881000	and a couple of memory cards. Mass Effect Trilogy. Those are the big ticket items.
5881000	5882000	And Dave Falcon said,
5882000	5886000	Assassin's Creed 3 for my fiancée for Hanukkah.
5886000	5889000	Well, that's what you bought somebody else. We want to know what you wanted under your tree.
5889000	5892000	But I guess that works.
5892000	5898000	Let's see. Moving on to our Google Plus community.
5898000	5901000	Just a few comments here, so I'll read these.
5901000	5905000	ActDeft says, I want an HDTV to play games in HD.
5905000	5908000	I'm still rocking a 15-inch SDTV.
5908000	5912000	A 3DS, since it's turning out to be a solid console now.
5912000	5914000	Forza Horizon Season Pass.
5914000	5917000	King of Fighters XIII for 360.
5917000	5919000	It's free on PlayStation Plus, just saying.
5919000	5922000	Although I guess PlayStation Plus isn't free, but whatever.
5922000	5924000	Zone of the Enders HD.
5924000	5926000	Everything on my Steam wish list.
5926000	5928000	RAM for my PC.
5928000	5931000	You have a big list, ActDeft.
5931000	5933000	Oh well, lots of options, right?
5933000	5935000	Monster Bee wants the following for Christmas.
5935000	5938000	A PlayStation 3 controller charging station,
5938000	5942000	and a Steam gift card to help support my addiction in 2013.
5942000	5948000	What are you talking about 2013? That winter sale will still be going on in 2012.
5948000	5951000	And lastly, AJ Twist replied and said,
5951000	5953000	King of Fighters XIII on PlayStation 3,
5953000	5955000	a PlayStation 3 arcade stick,
5955000	5960000	and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV Turtles in Time on the Super Nintendo.
5960000	5962000	Good pick. Good pick.
5962000	5965000	All right, that does it for the FUGL Question of the Week.
5965000	5968000	DarkSakura, do you have any holiday gaming wishes?
5968000	5970000	Garris.
5970000	5973000	Oh yes, you even replied on Facebook. You want your Garris figure, right?
5973000	5974000	Yep.
5974000	5976000	Where's that from?
5976000	5978000	Play Arts.
5978000	5982000	Did you see the Mass Effect museum-style artwork that they were selling?
5982000	5984000	I didn't see very big pictures of it, but it's okay.
5984000	5987000	It looked nice. Me wanty.
5987000	5989000	Loki, anything on your holiday list?
5989000	5993000	I have really pretty much, you know, I bought the last console game I'm going to get,
5993000	5999000	so, uh, real thing, you know, if I'm going to get gifted something,
5999000	6002000	like a year to PlayStation Plus would be kind of cool,
6002000	6004000	because I don't really want to pay for that.
6004000	6008000	I don't even know if I would really use that.
6008000	6013000	Maybe a Raspberry Pi, but trying to explain that to anybody.
6013000	6017000	You know, it would be difficult for them to understand what the hell I was talking about.
6017000	6020000	You want pie? I thought you didn't like pie.
6022000	6024000	Yeah, that'd pretty much be it.
6024000	6029000	I was going to say, it's funny, our family, we kind of draw names, you know,
6029000	6033000	and just get one person, except for, you know, Josh gets gifts from everybody.
6033000	6036000	My wife, she's like, oh, I hope I get your name.
6036000	6040000	She's all, you know, instead of, you know, your mom or something like that,
6040000	6042000	because I don't know what to get them.
6042000	6045000	So, she got my name, and she's like, I'm not getting you anything.
6046000	6047000	Like, thanks.
6047000	6048000	Nice, nice, happy holidays.
6048000	6051000	Well, maybe it'll be a surprise if she does get you something.
6051000	6052000	Don't hold your breath.
6052000	6054000	No, I'm not holding my breath.
6054000	6057000	Um, on my, again, I pretty much bought everything I wanted,
6057000	6061000	but I wouldn't mind if I got, like, an iCade, or even, like,
6061000	6064000	like, one of these things I don't think I would ever buy myself,
6064000	6067000	but if it showed up, I'd be kind of happy, would be one of those Atari Flashback consoles.
6067000	6068000	I like retro shit.
6068000	6070000	I don't even think they sell those anymore.
6070000	6072000	They do at Toys R Us. I saw one the other day.
6072000	6074000	I figured they'd have old ass inventory.
6074000	6076000	They're not the old, they're like the 3, the Flashback 3s,
6076000	6078000	or whatever the newest ones are.
6078000	6080000	So, I like retro shit.
6080000	6081000	It amuses me.
6081000	6086000	Or a Ben Heck Xbox 360 laptop would be fucking awesome.
6086000	6091000	I want a working Commodore 64 to hook up to my TV,
6091000	6093000	which I don't even think you could do without some major converters,
6093000	6095000	but damn it, I would try it.
6095000	6096000	Oh, man.
6096000	6098000	Well, don't they have, like, an RF adapter?
6098000	6100000	Yeah, well, um...
6100000	6102000	They have the, well, it's UHF, right?
6102000	6104000	Yeah, there was, you could hook up...
6104000	6106000	Well, they have the UHF to RF. They used to have this.
6106000	6109000	You could hook up a Commodore 64 through RF adapter,
6109000	6112000	or something that was very similar to RCA plugs,
6112000	6116000	except for one video and two audio, there was two video and one audio.
6116000	6118000	So, like, you could, like, they didn't cross work,
6118000	6121000	but you could probably get a converter for those, too, somewhere.
6121000	6125000	Well, I think the Commodore 64 monitors were RGB, like, arcade monitors.
6125000	6131000	So, I have a converter board for that, you know, to play arcade games on your TV.
6131000	6133000	AlphaCananagram in our chat room says,
6133000	6137000	Rob, it's an Atari Flashback 4 with wireless controls now.
6137000	6139000	Oh, I had no idea. There you go. I want one.
6139000	6141000	Gimme, gimme, I want it all.
6141000	6144000	All right, let's move on with some more news, Loki.
6144000	6148000	So, you know, Zynga and Facebook have been pretty chummy for a while now,
6148000	6150000	but now they're just trying to read, you know,
6150000	6154000	set out new terms as far as their partnership goes.
6154000	6157000	Basically, what's gonna happen is they're gonna have some opportunities
6157000	6160000	to have Facebook, to have kind of official Facebook games,
6160000	6166000	and also, it'll also kind of tie in with Zynga will still, I guess,
6166000	6171000	use Facebook's payment system, but they're gonna kind of try to,
6171000	6176000	I guess, find a way to separate a little bit.
6176000	6179000	They're gonna allow, it's gonna allow each of the parties like Zynga
6179000	6183000	to promote game, their own games that they create,
6183000	6187000	and also, I guess, before they were required to use,
6187000	6190000	I guess, Facebook's monetization platform,
6190000	6194000	and now Facebook could, you know, make their own games
6194000	6197000	to compete with Farmville and stuff.
6197000	6201000	So, unfortunately, you know, the way I see this as,
6201000	6206000	you know, there's so many Farmville and those types of game clones,
6206000	6211000	it's just, I think Facebook came out with the official Facebook farming game.
6211000	6213000	I don't think anyone would give a shit.
6213000	6217000	I think it would be just like, you know, if EA came out with a farming game,
6217000	6219000	no one would care.
6219000	6222000	Insert my typical Facebook rant here.
6222000	6224000	I'm just, I'm so over Facebook.
6224000	6226000	You know, I was talking to somebody on my Facebook tonight
6226000	6229000	about why I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook,
6229000	6232000	and there was even a post I saw on Twitter that kind of talked about this,
6232000	6236000	and I really do like, I just, I, right now, as of late,
6236000	6238000	I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook,
6238000	6241000	because even though there are offensive things on Twitter,
6241000	6245000	don't get me wrong, like, people tend to offend a lot less on Twitter,
6245000	6251000	and I think it's, like, the character restriction kind of is, you know,
6251000	6254000	tighter there, so you have to really think before you post,
6254000	6258000	and, like, people aren't as forthright to just spew stuff all over,
6258000	6260000	and, I don't know, it's great.
6260000	6262000	I loves Twitter.
6262000	6266000	It's not perfect, but I, and there's no games, no games.
6266000	6269000	The only thing that shows up in my feed, promoted posts,
6269000	6271000	and luckily, they're pretty easy to scroll past.
6271000	6273000	Those are also on Facebook.
6273000	6275000	Oh, yeah. In fact, the Frugal Question of the Week,
6275000	6278000	I posted it tonight, and Facebook brings up this little pop-up,
6278000	6281000	would you like to promote this post for only $5,
6281000	6284000	which made me think, oh, nobody's going to see the Frugal Question of the Week this week,
6284000	6286000	which reminds me, listeners,
6286000	6289000	although I'm not always the best at getting the Frugal Question up,
6289000	6291000	like, with a lot of time before the show,
6291000	6294000	I usually have it up a good four or five hours before the show,
6294000	6297000	so, like, you know, about an hour before the show starts,
6297000	6299000	load Facebook, go directly to our page,
6299000	6301000	and you'll find the question. It's there.
6301000	6304000	Because I'm worried that Facebook probably isn't showing it to you
6304000	6306000	because of their algorithm.
6307000	6310000	I would love to see a social network that's, like,
6310000	6312000	the good parts of Facebook,
6312000	6315000	combined with the way Twitter works,
6315000	6317000	combined with, like, Tumblr.
6317000	6321000	Like, the thing I can't stand about Tumblr is that it's all, like,
6321000	6323000	you can't, like, comment on anything,
6323000	6325000	and you can't have a conversation on Tumblr.
6325000	6327000	I hate the way you have conversations on Tumblr.
6327000	6330000	There's a lot of good content out there. It's good for fandoms and all that,
6330000	6333000	but I just, I can't figure Tumblr out.
6333000	6334000	I know Dark Sakura has.
6334000	6335000	Tumblr's awesome.
6335000	6336000	Yeah.
6337000	6340000	Black Wolf says, really? There's Twitter drama every week.
6340000	6344000	Yeah, but in a Michael Jackson eating popcorn gif kind of way.
6344000	6346000	The good news is it usually doesn't involve me or my friends,
6346000	6348000	so I'm okay with it.
6348000	6351000	Twitter drama is when celebrities say shit, you know.
6352000	6353000	Anyway.
6354000	6355000	Moving on.
6355000	6358000	I don't want to talk all about social networking.
6358000	6360000	Everybody knows where they stand.
6360000	6363000	Sales figures coming in from the launch weekend of the Wii U for,
6363000	6365000	excuse me, launch week.
6365000	6369000	400,000 Wii U's sold in the first week.
6370000	6371000	Over that same period,
6371000	6376000	Nintendo sold 300,000 Wii consoles and 500,000 portable devices.
6376000	6380000	That's 1.2 million units sold in the US.
6381000	6386000	Also, it should be noted that the Xbox and Playstation sales figures came in,
6386000	6389000	and I apologize, I don't have it in front of me,
6389000	6393000	but it was around 700,000, 750,000 for the Xboxes,
6393000	6399000	and I want to say Sony was 700,000 when you combined both the Playstation 3 and the Vita,
6399000	6401000	which led a lot of people to say,
6401000	6404000	OMG, we use dead already.
6404000	6405000	We use dead already.
6405000	6409000	Xbox 360 is six-year-old consoles out selling the Wii U.
6409000	6410000	Wait a minute.
6411000	6413000	What is the internet forgetting, Loki?
6413000	6416000	They're forgetting that that's all that was available.
6416000	6417000	It sold out.
6417000	6421000	It's just they only made that many consoles available at the time.
6421000	6424000	You also have to figure if they sold any more of that,
6424000	6427000	well, actually the first week would have included Black Friday, I would assume.
6427000	6431000	So, you know, there's that kind of thrown there.
6431000	6433000	A lot of people are holding back their consoles until Black Friday.
6433000	6436000	But yes, there's not like Wii U sitting on the shelves.
6436000	6439000	Trust me, they're nowhere at all.
6439000	6442000	And how did the Xbox 360 sell in its first week?
6442000	6446000	I mean, those things were fucking diamonds to find when they originally came out.
6446000	6449000	Remember the Xbox 360 launch and how shitty it was?
6449000	6451000	Like, those things were really hard to find,
6451000	6454000	so I would bet their sales numbers were not so hot,
6454000	6457000	and a lot of that was because of supply and demand as well.
6457000	6460000	So, I think it's comparing apples to oranges a little bit.
6460000	6462000	Well, and also that's a little bit different, too,
6462000	6466000	because, you know, you're talking about a real generation jump there.
6466000	6468000	It's the first next-gen console.
6468000	6471000	Whereas the Wii U is kind of like, it's not really a next-gen console.
6471000	6473000	I mean, the graphics aren't like,
6473000	6476000	oh my god, this is like way different than what I'm seeing on the other consoles.
6476000	6477000	It's just...
6477000	6478000	It's Nintendo doing its thing.
6478000	6479000	Yeah.
6479000	6483000	So, it doesn't have the same impact, I guess.
6483000	6487000	So, yeah, you can't compare those sales numbers.
6488000	6490000	I would say look at it, you know,
6490000	6493000	how are the Wii U's selling six months from now?
6493000	6495000	That'll be telling.
6495000	6496000	Basically, it looks like this.
6496000	6498000	If all of a sudden, you know,
6498000	6502000	Wii's start getting a bunch in stock, like, right away,
6502000	6505000	then that's a problem, because then that means that they're sitting...
6505000	6507000	that there's no demand at the stores.
6507000	6508000	They are still showing up at the...
6508000	6509000	Speaking of Twitter, haha,
6509000	6512000	I just saw a picture of a bunch of them sitting at a Best Buy
6512000	6513000	that somebody took a picture of.
6513000	6515000	So, I mean, they are being replenished out there,
6515000	6519000	so don't think you won't have one for the holidays if you don't want one.
6519000	6521000	You can still find them.
6521000	6524000	Even if GameStop got rid of their call list or whatever the hell that was.
6524000	6525000	Don't go to GameStop.
6525000	6526000	Yeah, just don't go to GameStop.
6526000	6529000	Seriously, because I remember it was when I got the PSP.
6529000	6531000	I don't even know if you were with me or not.
6531000	6533000	I don't think you were.
6533000	6536000	But no, it was when I got the PSP,
6536000	6540000	I went to GameStop, and they're like,
6540000	6542000	oh, good luck finding one of those.
6542000	6544000	You'll never find a PSP.
6544000	6545000	Went to Best Buy.
6545000	6547000	They had a whole case of them sitting there.
6547000	6548000	So...
6548000	6551000	Yeah, I hate the attitude of a lot of people I've seen working there.
6551000	6553000	So if you didn't pre-order, you're never going to get that.
6553000	6554000	Yeah.
6554000	6555000	No, that's not true.
6555000	6557000	Try me, bitch.
6557000	6558000	Or the games.
6558000	6560000	I'm not going to get them on release day if I don't pre-order.
6560000	6562000	Amazon.com.
6562000	6563000	Pwned.
6563000	6568000	Like, be aware of what you're really competing with, people.
6568000	6571000	Anywhere else.
6571000	6572000	Moving on.
6572000	6573000	Dark Sakura.
6573000	6575000	Well, we can move on to other news.
6575000	6578000	How about Steam's Greenlight?
6578000	6580000	There's a third batch of games being accepted.
6580000	6583000	And it actually looks a little bit like Primordia.
6583000	6585000	The other one is Walking Mars.
6585000	6589000	But Primordia is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi game
6589000	6594000	that Valve actually rejected after several indie titles were pulled in.
6594000	6599000	And then the other one was Walking Mars done by Tigerstyle.
6599000	6605000	It was an OS game and it made App of the Day back for Eurogamer.
6605000	6607000	Don't know if anyone remembers that.
6607000	6609000	I think I'm the only one here that follows Eurogamer.
6609000	6613000	I read a review of theirs today.
6613000	6616000	I couldn't understand why I didn't jive up with what the rest of the internet was saying.
6616000	6623000	But the now full games on the list is Black Space, DarkFoil and Holy Wars, Dawn of Fantasy,
6623000	6628000	Dragon's Lair, Eurotruck Simulator 2, Gear Up, Kinetic Void Space Adventure,
6628000	6634000	The Light, No Time to Explain, Primordia, Sangfroid, Tales of Werewolves, Starforge and Walking Mars.
6634000	6637000	So, pretty good.
6637000	6639000	Loki?
6639000	6642000	So the Ouya is making progress.
6642000	6648000	They announced that they're going to be able to start shipping consoles December 28th.
6648000	6651000	Now, it's not necessarily consoles to users,
6651000	6654000	but those are development kits that are going to be going out
6654000	6659000	for any developers that want to start making games for it.
6659000	6663000	And basically, I forget how much money you have to donate
6663000	6668000	or contribute for Kickstarter in order to get one of those.
6668000	6670000	It was a few hundred dollars.
6670000	6673000	But those people are going to be getting their consoles soon.
6673000	6676000	And it sounds like everything is going as planned.
6676000	6679000	And man, that thing is tiny.
6679000	6681000	It has a tiny console.
6681000	6685000	It's like a Rubik's Cube size.
6685000	6687000	So that's going to be pretty sweet when that comes out.
6687000	6690000	Still targeting March as a release.
6690000	6696000	And of course, right now they're saying that you can download the official development kit
6696000	6700000	if you haven't gotten your console yet and you can start working on stuff
6700000	6704000	and then they're going to be updating that stuff later on.
6704000	6709000	I think I want to say that every console is going to be coming with a dev kit
6709000	6711000	or some sort of way where you can make your own.
6711000	6716000	If they're so open, I don't see why they wouldn't all function as dev kits in a way.
6716000	6719000	I think they will. It's just these consoles are a little bit earlier.
6719000	6722000	But yeah, it's going to be interesting.
6722000	6723000	So it's really happening?
6723000	6725000	It's really happening.
6725000	6728000	Because when the whole Ouya thing first happened, there were a lot of people saying,
6728000	6731000	and I may or may not have said this myself, sure it'll happen.
6731000	6736000	If you put a story about how it's going to fail and stuff, it gets page hits
6736000	6739000	because people want to read up about...
6739000	6741000	They like watching car crashes.
6741000	6743000	So we'll see.
6743000	6746000	And let's be honest, it's not out yet to everybody.
6746000	6751000	But I wouldn't be surprised if it's delayed past March
6751000	6755000	because a lot of the Kickstars that I've been contributing to,
6755000	6757000	not a lot of them have been on time.
6757000	6761000	Like hell, the stuff I got from Freddie Wong and the whole VJHS stuff
6762000	6768000	arrived just a couple weeks ago versus the targeted date was March.
6768000	6770000	So that's a long delay.
6770000	6775000	But I have a little trust that they're going to actually deliver on stuff.
6775000	6778000	It's just not exactly in the timetable that they were talking about.
6781000	6782000	BlackWolf in our chat says,
6782000	6785000	I'll believe it when I see it. It still has a chance to fail.
6785000	6787000	The Mayans predicted its failure.
6787000	6789000	True point.
6790000	6792000	Some of the Kickstarters I've backed, I've only backed two.
6792000	6795000	But GamerCon, that has to happen on the weekend.
6795000	6796000	They say it's going to happen.
6796000	6798000	I know they booked the venue and it's moving forward.
6798000	6800000	So I don't see how that's not going to happen when they say it does.
6800000	6801000	That should be exciting.
6801000	6805000	And then the Shadowgate reboot was the other thing I Kickstarted.
6805000	6807000	So I'm excited to see what comes of that.
6807000	6809000	They send updates all the time.
6809000	6810000	I had to stop reading them.
6810000	6812000	They send too many damn updates.
6812000	6814000	They were up to update 29.
6814000	6816000	I think it's more than that.
6816000	6817000	The Shadowgate one.
6817000	6818000	Did you back that too?
6818000	6821000	Yeah, I did. I backed the first one.
6821000	6826000	It was, I don't even remember what updates they have now.
6826000	6828000	But I get updates from a lot of these.
6828000	6833000	I've got at least four or five right now that I'm waiting on.
6833000	6835000	Oh, here's another update. Let's see who this one is.
6835000	6837000	Oh, this is Ouya.
6837000	6838000	The same thing I just talked about.
6838000	6840000	The dead kids are shipping.
6840000	6844000	But yeah, they've got a bunch of updates.
6844000	6845000	In fact, there's this one.
6846000	6848000	I like, there's one I did.
6848000	6851000	I draw comics sketchbook and reference guide.
6851000	6852000	Because it looked awesome.
6852000	6853000	There you go.
6853000	6857000	Moving on to another news and rumor type of thing.
6857000	6861000	Yoshi's Land rumored for the Wii U.
6861000	6865000	And now Best Buy and Future Shop are apparently taking pre-orders for it.
6865000	6868000	This is after the whole Miiverse hack.
6868000	6871000	That's not really a hack, but everybody called it that.
6871000	6875000	Where the guy found the page, the mockup that Nintendo pulled and put the statement out on.
6875000	6881000	Apparently Best Buy even has a little description of the game for Yoshi's Land.
6881000	6886000	Quote, take Yoshi on an epic adventure to remember in Yoshi Land for Nintendo Wii U.
6886000	6889000	Check out Yoshi as you've never seen him before in glorious high definition.
6889000	6892000	Enjoy dual screen control thanks to the Wii U touch screen game pad.
6892000	6896000	Where you'll also be able to experience full integration with Nintendo's Miiverse service.
6896000	6901000	Well, that's a whole lot of nothing because anybody could guess that on the title alone.
6901000	6904000	But it's interesting that that exists.
6904000	6908000	I'll give you some tin foil hatness here if you want.
6908000	6915000	I believe Reggie has teased a couple times that maybe we don't really know everything that's going to be in the launch window.
6915000	6917000	Maybe there's something else.
6917000	6919000	This could be that something else.
6919000	6923000	And speaking of Twitter and promoted posts.
6923000	6928000	One of the posts that fell on my feed earlier this evening was from Spike TV saying,
6928000	6931000	Hey gamers, don't forget to watch the Spike Video Game Awards.
6931000	6935000	More first party exclusive reveals or whatever.
6935000	6938000	More big game reveals.
6938000	6943000	We saw Miyamoto come out on stage at the last Spike TV Awards to great reception.
6943000	6951000	Maybe, maybe, tin foil hat, Yoshi's Land to be revealed at Spike Gamer Awards.
6951000	6953000	Discuss.
6953000	6957000	I think it's just a bunch of bullshit that, you know, let's be honest here.
6957000	6959000	Of course you do.
6959000	6963000	Let's be honest, I mean, GameStop was taking, I'm still seeing if it's on here right now.
6963000	6971000	GameStop was taking pre-orders for like, what, Pilotwings for the Wii and like Mario Paint.
6971000	6974000	You know, I think they had Mario Paint for like the Wii U and stuff.
6974000	6980000	There's a whole bunch of TBA stuff that someone gets an idea that there might be something coming out.
6980000	6982000	And then they'll put a pre-order for it because guess what?
6982000	6986000	That's giving them your money.
6986000	6989000	They're taking a pre-order for a game and if it doesn't come out, hey, guess what?
6989000	6994000	We've got this credit that you paid for this game and now you can apply this to another game.
6994000	6999000	It's why companies love gift cards because there's so many people that never spend them.
6999000	7003000	Or just, you know, have remaining balances on them that they end up, you know, they throw the card away.
7003000	7006000	Oh, it's just a 50 cent balance, just throw it away.
7006000	7008000	Well, the company just made 50 cents off you.
7008000	7009000	Yeah.
7009000	7013000	You know, and if that happens a thousand times, it starts to become a little bit of money.
7024000	7030000	Tigerclaw has a thought that maybe the Spike VGAs will reveal Bungie's new game, which recently had leaked concept art.
7030000	7032000	That's another great thought, actually.
7032000	7037000	They've already said which games are getting reveals, or at least some of them.
7037000	7044000	Like The Last of Us, and I don't think it's necessarily revealed, but like a new gameplay thing.
7044000	7052000	And I'm trying to remember what else was on there. I think maybe Fuse? I don't know.
7054000	7059000	I watched the little trailer that they had with Samuel L. Jackson as a baby. That was weird.
7059000	7067000	Eh. I didn't watch any of it. I'm just gonna wait until five minutes after the show's over, and then everything shows up on YouTube.
7067000	7070000	That's all I need. I just want the YouTubes with the reveals.
7070000	7073000	Kind of like the year that Skyrim was announced. YouTube.
7075000	7077000	Do you think maybe a new Batman game will be announced?
7077000	7078000	God, I hope not.
7078000	7081000	It could be, but what are you talking about? Bite your tongue.
7081000	7085000	Arkham City was amazing. You know where you can put that thumb.
7085000	7089000	Alright, let's move on. Loki gave me a thumbs down.
7090000	7092000	You really hate Arkham City?
7092000	7094000	I don't hate it. I've never played it. But I just don't want to see another...
7094000	7096000	You don't know shit! Shut up!
7096000	7099000	I don't want to see another Batman game. I think it's stupid.
7099000	7102000	Oh my God. Oh, this conversation. I can't talk to you.
7102000	7106000	Why would you have another Batman game when they just released one last year?
7106000	7112000	I mean, seriously, what is it again? Batman Arkham State! Oh, the whole state is a prison now!
7113000	7116000	I think they had joked they were going to call it Arkham World, but that didn't...
7116000	7117000	Arkham World?
7117000	7118000	That didn't actually mean...
7118000	7124000	Hey, I have an idea. Let's get Snake Pliston in here. He'll fucking escape from New York.
7124000	7129000	Oh wait, but it's going to be Batman instead. But hey, whatever. We'll just rip it off. It'll be fun.
7129000	7132000	It doesn't actually mean world, dummy.
7132000	7136000	We're going to see how many more Batman villains we can shove in here.
7136000	7140000	Hey, is there any other obscure Batman villains that we haven't tackled yet?
7140000	7143000	You know, maybe we can just get Lex Luthor in there because we're running out of Batman villains.
7143000	7147000	Your opinion does not even count! You haven't even played the game!
7148000	7150000	You lose! Good day, sir!
7150000	7153000	I am totally enjoying this. I'm just sitting back going, mm-hmm.
7153000	7155000	He's an idiot! Tell him!
7157000	7158000	Rob thinks you're an idiot.
7160000	7162000	Cool. I don't care what Rob thinks.
7165000	7167000	Well, we care what you think.
7168000	7174000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails, you know, if you want to call low-key an idiot.
7174000	7175000	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
7175000	7178000	You know what? I'm such an idiot because I actually don't have the mailbag pulled up.
7179000	7182000	Dark Soccer, you're an idiot too! I'm surrounded by idiots!
7182000	7183000	I am not!
7183000	7185000	No, you're surrounded by assholes. It's different.
7185000	7187000	I'm going to go play Arkham City.
7187000	7189000	Hold on, I'm pulling it up.
7189000	7197000	It's just, I've been sort of doing some damage management of a severe nature.
7197000	7198000	Okay.
7198000	7200000	Sorry, I'm pulling up the email now.
7200000	7201000	Alright.
7201000	7205000	I want gossip, girl. You gotta tell me about this after the email bag.
7208000	7209000	TigerClawn.
7209000	7211000	I played Arkham Asylum at E3.
7211000	7213000	You know what game I hate? Earth Defense Force.
7213000	7214000	That's fine.
7214000	7215000	Oh, lord.
7215000	7216000	See, now you're just trolling.
7216000	7218000	It's for bros. Oh, I've never played it.
7218000	7219000	Now you're just trolling.
7220000	7222000	They see you trolling, they're hating.
7223000	7225000	Well, we only have one email.
7226000	7227000	Okay.
7227000	7229000	Hello, OLR. Another email from Belgium here.
7229000	7231000	Yay, Belgium!
7232000	7239000	Since Sony is doing so bad, I've been thinking lately, do you guys think Sony will have enough resources to launch a decent next-gen system?
7239000	7244000	It costs billions of dollars to develop and launch a new console and they don't have that kind of money.
7244000	7245000	I think they do.
7245000	7249000	Also, with their rating dropping, banks will be less eager to loan the money.
7249000	7254000	I believe Nintendo made the Wii technologically inferior because of money problems, or is this wrong?
7255000	7256000	You know what?
7256000	7258000	That's a damn good point.
7260000	7261000	I don't know.
7261000	7265000	It could be, the PlayStation 4 could end up being a bunch of smoke and mirrors, too.
7265000	7272000	It could be that, you know, this whole tech with the controller changing or whatever may be the big thing,
7272000	7275000	and it's not really that souped up of a system.
7275000	7278000	I kind of think the internet would crucify them if that happened.
7278000	7282000	Honestly, someone trying to separate their controller that they have right now.
7282000	7287000	I broke my controller, I split it in two, and it's not working like I saw in the picture.
7287000	7289000	I've said this before and I'll say it again.
7289000	7292000	I don't think Sony has to launch a new console next year.
7292000	7296000	Why not sell more PlayStation 3s by putting out amazing games?
7296000	7302000	You know, I realize a lot of people expect Sony to put out a console next year because of what Microsoft is doing, but...
7302000	7305000	I don't even know if Microsoft's putting out a console next year.
7305000	7307000	That's all, yeah, that's all...
7307000	7311000	Remember, we're just listening to analysts that are speaking out of their ass.
7311000	7312000	That's right.
7312000	7313000	Anal.
7314000	7316000	Also, I'll go ahead and read it.
7316000	7320000	Also, I'd like to ask if you guys would plug the volunteering I do for a local playground.
7320000	7323000	I posted a thread in an off-topic part of the forum called,
7323000	7325000	Can you please vote for us on a website?
7325000	7328000	And that's on our VOG forum, so you can look for it.
7328000	7333000	We have a chance to win, I guess it's 2,000 euros if we get the most votes.
7333000	7336000	As always, thanks a lot for making a new episode every week.
7336000	7337000	You rock.
7337000	7339000	P.S. if we win the contest, I'll send you a box of Belgian chocolates.
7339000	7340000	Ooh, deal.
7340000	7342000	Totally, as long as they're dark chocolate.
7342000	7343000	Go vote now.
7343000	7345000	I'm gonna share this with the chat room.
7345000	7347000	It is a playground, it's volunteer.
7347000	7349000	It's for a good cause.
7349000	7351000	We totally support this.
7351000	7352000	We like games of all sorts.
7352000	7354000	Including the ones you play outdoors.
7354000	7356000	So, good luck buddy, I hope you win.
7356000	7358000	And yes to the chocolate.
7358000	7360000	By the way, you'll love this idea.
7360000	7362000	Or maybe you won't, I don't know.
7362000	7364000	But, um, Sil from Girls Gone Wow.
7364000	7365000	I love Sil.
7365000	7367000	I love her too, she's so great.
7367000	7370000	But, uh, we were talking to each other on Facebook.
7370000	7373000	And we're gonna do a candy exchange.
7373000	7376000	Where she's gonna send me candy from the UK that you can't get here.
7376000	7380000	And I'm gonna send her stuff from the US that we all take for granted that you can't get over there.
7381000	7383000	I guess, like, Pop-Tarts?
7383000	7385000	You can't get in the UK?
7385000	7386000	Peanut butter.
7386000	7387000	Really?
7387000	7388000	Yeah.
7388000	7389000	Like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?
7389000	7390000	Rob, they use Marmite.
7390000	7391000	Ugh.
7391000	7392000	Ugh.
7392000	7393000	Weird.
7393000	7394000	You know what?
7394000	7398000	Um, I did a candy exchange with, um, with, uh, Robert K.
7398000	7400000	And he sent me...
7400000	7404000	Now, sadly, I was allergic to the candy that he sent me because I can't eat gummies.
7404000	7405000	Don't.
7405000	7406000	But I sent...
7406000	7407000	I would've eaten it.
7407000	7408000	I brought it, remember?
7408000	7409000	The Jelly Babies and stuff?
7409000	7410000	That's right, you did.
7410000	7411000	Yeah, yeah.
7411000	7418000	But, um, I sent a bunch of these, um, Baskin-Robbins candies that were these hard candies flavored
7418000	7419000	like Baskin-Robbins ice creams.
7419000	7420000	Oh, yeah.
7420000	7421000	I remember those.
7421000	7422000	Those are good.
7422000	7423000	And he said he really liked them.
7423000	7424000	I also sent him cans of salsa.
7424000	7426000	Is that something you can't get over there?
7426000	7427000	I'm not sure you can get salsa.
7427000	7433460	Just, this was actually, like, the, uh, the, uh, what's, what's the Mexican, um, grocery
7433460	7434460	stores called?
7434460	7437120	Um, oh, God.
7437120	7439120	No, this was actually, like, authentic.
7439120	7441280	Yeah, down, down in L.A. you see them everywhere.
7441280	7442280	I can't remember the name of it.
7442280	7443280	Carson something?
7443280	7444280	Yeah, yeah.
7444280	7445280	Carcinogen.
7445280	7449760	Well, okay, what's funny is that Sil linked me to a website that, you know, I would never
7449760	7455160	look this shit up, but it's a store in the U.K. that sells American imported goods.
7455160	7458720	And it was just hilarious looking at the stuff they were advertising on the site, like Captain
7458720	7459720	Crunch.
7459720	7461920	I'm like, oh, I take that shit for granted that you can just get Captain Crunch at the
7461920	7463280	grocery store here.
7463280	7468640	And even speaking of, like, Mexico, you could get, cause how easy is it to get yarritos?
7468640	7469840	The soda, right?
7469840	7470840	Here it is.
7470840	7473320	I'd never saw one until I moved out here.
7473320	7476720	But especially, like, even at Target and stuff, you can get, like, the quote unquote Mexican
7476720	7477720	Coke.
7477720	7478720	It's very easy to get.
7478720	7479720	They have a whole little wall.
7479720	7482760	Well, I'll tell you what, you see it a lot during Passover because it's not made with
7482760	7483760	corn syrup.
7483760	7484760	Ah, very true.
7484760	7486560	And corn is considered not kosher for Passover.
7486560	7488040	But you see it all the time at Target.
7488040	7489720	Like, Target has their...
7489720	7490720	Or throwback.
7491720	7494320	Jones soda, I guess, is the thing, too, you can't get in the U.K.
7494320	7495320	Jones is so good.
7495320	7496680	It's even kind of hard to find here.
7496680	7500960	I wish we could get one of the Thanksgiving boxes and send it over because, you know,
7500960	7505240	like the gravy one is weird, but I hear that the cranberry sauce soda is actually really
7505240	7506240	delicious.
7506240	7507240	Here's the thing, though.
7507240	7512320	Cyl says she can't have it till February because she's on a lifestyle adjustment until February,
7512320	7513960	so she can't get the candy till then.
7513960	7518760	But little does she know, she didn't say how big the box had to be.
7518800	7522800	So I plan on spoiling her because I do really like Cyl.
7522800	7528720	She's great being a team player with a vog and everything, so she's going to have a lot
7528720	7531000	of candy coming her way.
7531000	7533320	How easy is it to get candy here?
7533320	7537200	Like I'll just go to Target the day after Christmas, get all that candy.
7537200	7538200	It'd be crazy.
7538200	7539200	All right.
7539200	7540200	Let's move on.
7540200	7541200	Enough candy talk.
7541200	7542200	That was it for emails, huh?
7542200	7543200	Just one email tonight?
7543200	7544200	Yeah.
7544200	7548880	Email mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to email us in a future episode.
7548880	7555920	Meanwhile, it's time for a segment we do every week here on the show, often imitated, never
7555920	7556920	duplicated.
7556920	7557920	Haha.
7557920	7558920	It's the FUs of the week.
7574200	7584320	Um, FUs to misunderstandings, um, and yeah, I'm doing, um, some damage control.
7584320	7589600	It's not a big thing, not really, um, it's just, yeah.
7589600	7599160	Anyway, um, and, uh, also, uh, FUs to, uh, the, what, three inches of water in my backseat
7599160	7600800	on the passenger side.
7600800	7605480	Um, there's a seal broken somewhere in my car and yeah, that almost cost me my laptop
7605480	7606480	once.
7606480	7609480	So yeah, that sucks.
7609480	7620600	Um, I guess FU to, I don't know, I don't know where, I'd rather take the, you know, the
7620600	7630080	week off and play some far cry three, but, uh, you know, job money, I don't open.
7630080	7635040	Black Wolf wanted us to clarify that what you're talking about has nothing to do with
7635040	7636040	fog.
7636040	7637040	Everything's happy-go-lucky above.
7637040	7645040	Um, as far as I know, um, let's see, my FU of the week goes to, um, sleeping so much.
7645040	7649760	Oh my God, you guys is disgusting how much I've slept over this weekend, but I feel great.
7649760	7651680	Uh, and FU to the weather.
7651680	7653920	It's been nonstop shitty for the past three days.
7653920	7654920	I'm thankful.
7654920	7655920	It's finally clear enough.
7655920	7656920	That makes me for a couple of days.
7656920	7657920	Shut up.
7657920	7662720	I don't like for a couple of days though, as long as it's not as bad as I don't mind
7662720	7666640	like the light rain and all this, but just the constant like shit after shit followed
7666640	7667980	by more shit.
7667980	7669920	And then the warning, it's going to flood shit everywhere.
7669920	7673040	I put up my Christmas lights to clean out my gutters.
7673040	7678100	They're released on the tree one night later, all the leaves fell every single one of them
7678100	7681960	into the gutters like, God damn it.
7681960	7684680	Why couldn't have been lazy longer?
7685680	7687600	All right.
7687600	7690800	Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then we'll open up the Skype line at one
7690800	7691800	eight seven seven game.
7691800	7692800	O L R.
7692800	7693800	All right.
7693800	7699720	So there was a, a new Kickstarter for this LA game space and what's kind of unique about
7699720	7700720	it.
7700720	7705520	Um, they're going to be creating some new games to kind of, I guess, go along with this.
7705520	7709840	And some of the games that they're getting created are actually by some pretty famous
7709840	7714360	people including, um, they've got the creator of Katamari Damacy.
7714360	7721960	Um, was it, uh, Keita or Keita, uh, Takahashi Keita Takahashi.
7721960	7727680	And also they had, uh, Adam Saltzman, who is the guy did a cannibal.
7727680	7731520	And they're going to be, um, I guess, creating a game for the people that back the project
7731520	7736600	also, um, to go along with that, they've got some more, um, games being coming or coming
7736600	7737600	out.
7737600	7741880	I guess there are going to be 30 new games from different, uh, indie developers are pretty
7741880	7750680	prominent including, um, stuff by, uh, was it the guy did Hotline Miami, uh, Steve Swink
7750680	7752520	of Scale.
7752520	7756600	And also, I guess, uh, the guy that did, uh, Unfinished Swan.
7756600	7762640	And they're going to get, uh, Pendleton Ward also, um, who did, uh, I guess, he's doing
7762640	7771920	a game with, um, Banette Foddy who did QWOP and CLOP, which I really need to go back and
7771920	7775880	play because, oh god, CLOP was awesome.
7775880	7781180	Uh, so yes, they're going to be, if you, um, and that, it's pretty awesome, if you pledge
7781180	7783560	$15 or more you get those 30 games.
7783560	7785120	So that's pretty awesome.
7785120	7791440	And $5 or more and you get that one game that's being done by, um, the two first guys I mentioned.
7791440	7793680	So definitely check it out.
7793680	7797200	They're probably going to hit their goal because they're looking for $250,000.
7797200	7800600	They have four days left to go and they're at $234,000, so.
7800600	7801600	I think they'll be okay.
7801600	7802600	I think they'll be alright.
7802600	7805920	Although, although there was another one I did see that they were looking for $50,000,
7805920	7807760	they missed it by $28.
7807760	7809480	Oh ho ho.
7809480	7810840	And if you don't make it, you get none of it.
7810840	7811840	You get none of it.
7811840	7812840	You can try again.
7812840	7813840	Ouch.
7813840	7814840	Yeah, that's true.
7814840	7820200	Alright, well, lastly tonight, before we go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR and the Twitter
7820200	7823680	at twitter.com slash O-L-R, this is a bit of a visual.
7823680	7826440	I apologize guys, but you can Google this.
7826440	7833680	The cover of the final Nintendo Power has been released and it is awesomely nostalgic.
7833680	7836040	I think it's a perfect send off to the magazine.
7836040	7837980	It ends the way it began.
7837980	7842920	The final cover looks a lot like the first cover only instead of, you know, the very
7842920	7846140	first cover in Nintendo Power was Super Mario 2.
7846140	7849480	And so you have Wart in the background and you have like the vegetables cause that was
7849480	7851400	a big part of Mario 2.
7851400	7856840	The final cover of Nintendo Power is for New Super Mario Brothers U with Bowser in the
7856840	7862720	background and Goombas, but still just the very similar, you know, look.
7862720	7866600	You clearly get the reference here if you've been a fan of Nintendo Power.
7866600	7869960	Also what's very interesting when you put the two covers side by side, you really notice
7869960	7874800	that on that first cover of Nintendo Power, Mario's color palette was wrong.
7874800	7875800	It was reversed.
7875800	7876800	Yeah.
7877800	7881200	The blue overalls is right and the red shirt, but his hat, his hat's wrong.
7881200	7886600	So kind of interesting that that's all screwed up, but regardless, a great send off and even
7886600	7890800	like the same colors as a designer Dark Sakura doesn't make you happy.
7890800	7892360	Yeah, for the most part.
7892360	7896280	I mean, it's actually a lot better laid out.
7896280	7897280	It's more dynamic.
7897280	7898280	I'll say that.
7898280	7903780	But then again, the Nintendo Power logo, the new one also lends itself to a bit more dynamic
7903780	7905880	because of the differences in size.
7905960	7910360	I also just like, like even the little POW is the same, the little POW poster inside.
7910360	7911600	Poster inside is like the same.
7911600	7912700	I love it.
7912700	7915880	So it makes me sad to see Nintendo Power go.
7915880	7918680	But then again, if I was going to be that sad, I wouldn't have stopped reading it about
7918680	7919840	like 15 years ago.
7919840	7923080	Sorry not to be Debbie Downer, but that's the reason why the magazines are going out
7923080	7924220	of business.
7924220	7929160	So hopefully there'll be something else in the future, maybe a newsstand app on the iPhone
7929160	7930160	or something.
7930160	7932560	I don't know, but we'll see.
7932560	7935160	Anyhow, let's go to the phones.
7935160	7940080	One eight seven seven game O.L.R. or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
7940080	7945440	Oh, act deft catches this in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com, pointing
7945440	7950280	out the last issue has Mario going to the pole, meaning the end.
7950280	7952200	I didn't even catch that.
7952200	7955240	It looked like the halfway point flagged me, but going to the pole because that's where
7955240	7957840	he's going to work from now on.
7957840	7962040	On the pole, the whole Mario is not going to the pole.
7962040	7963040	Whole new era.
7963040	7964440	Mario is not going to the pole.
7964440	7966360	Those games still sell like crazy.
7966360	7970040	I guarantee besides Nintendo Land is the top selling Wii U game right now.
7970040	7973320	Yeah, but what's what's the way you're going to expand your demographic into the stripper
7973320	7977920	market than getting, you know, strippers in your games?
7977920	7982400	Yes, because that's exactly what they need to get at Nintendo is strippers.
7982400	7984040	I think I need strippers now.
7984040	7985680	I think they should.
7986400	7987400	All right.
7987400	7992240	Again, the phones one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or a username on Skype is orange lounge
7992240	7993240	radio.
7993240	7996840	Before I get to the Twitter's, Loki, do you have any last minute?
7996840	8000400	Yeah, they have got some cool plug ins for Gary's mod.
8000400	8005440	It's coming out December six and it's basically a Kinect PC plug in.
8005440	8010120	You'll be able to do body capture using the Kinect.
8010120	8014000	You're going to need Kinect for Windows runtime version one point six.
8014000	8018800	But you're going to be able to do all sorts of funny stuff with Gary's mod with that.
8018800	8020800	All right.
8020800	8021800	Let's go to the phones.
8021800	8022800	We have a call coming in.
8022800	8023800	Hi.
8023800	8024800	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8024800	8025800	Who's this?
8025800	8027440	He's like, oh, we see you tonight.
8027440	8029760	Yes, because I have a webcam now.
8029760	8030760	You sure do.
8030760	8031760	All right.
8031760	8032760	What's on your mind, buddy?
8032760	8033760	You know, I need to get a webcam.
8033760	8034760	Still need one.
8034760	8041960	I know you have a question the week so on the face of my Facebook news feed earlier
8041960	8043960	today and get a chance to answer it.
8043960	8046900	But there is one thing I am looking forward.
8046900	8053200	This holiday season is supposed to PS3 that my girlfriend is hinting at.
8053200	8054200	So I am.
8054200	8056920	In other words, a new system is probably on my way.
8056920	8057920	Lucky you.
8057920	8064020	Well, I mean, it makes it for the fact that I got her car stereo and the other Hanukkah
8064020	8067620	present that will be forthcoming.
8067620	8068620	You can't give it.
8068620	8069620	You never know.
8069620	8070640	She might be a listener of this program.
8070640	8072400	You don't want to give it all away.
8072840	8075280	Well, actually, she doesn't listen to this.
8075280	8082600	I mean, video games is only a small fraction of her life aside from taking care of wildlife
8082600	8085880	and watching anime and British dramas.
8085880	8092760	But yeah, now that I am going to presume that I am definitely getting a PS3 this holiday
8092760	8096680	season, I am just trying to see where to begin from there.
8096680	8101480	Because this is like the first time I am getting a new system since I got my 360.
8101560	8105920	Well, I was just about to ask you, if let's say you are right on your hunch and you do
8105920	8109440	end up getting a PlayStation 3, what do you think you are going to get?
8109440	8114160	I am probably going to get the games that I were hinting at, stuff like Gran Turismo
8114160	8122760	5, Metal Gear Solid 4, the Uncharted series, so pretty much all of the PS3 exclusives.
8122760	8126560	Because there is no way I am going to get any other multi-platform game that I would
8126560	8128600	otherwise get off PC.
8128600	8134600	I think this goes to the argument that if you compare both Microsoft and Sony in terms
8134600	8144920	of games that are more first party, it looks like if you compare them side by side aside
8144920	8153440	from Halo and Forza and Fable, you have a bit more first party titles on Sony's side
8153440	8155560	than you would in Microsoft.
8155560	8158120	Anything in between is just multi-platform.
8158120	8162040	Since it came up earlier, we were talking a lot about how Sony has a lot of great download
8162040	8163880	stuff on PSN that people are overlooking.
8163880	8169280	Do you have any interest in Journey or the Swann game or Unfinished Swann or any of that
8169280	8170280	stuff?
8170280	8172160	Yeah, I would have to.
8172160	8173840	I am definitely looking forward to it.
8173840	8180320	I am looking forward to Home in particular and seeing what that thing is about.
8180320	8183760	More importantly, I guess after I get the PS3, then I have to figure out which high
8183760	8189720	def TV I am looking for because I am putting it off, to be honest, trying to find something
8189720	8195400	that is really fast, that is under one frame of black.
8195400	8202440	For my rhythm and dancing games, I need something really fast and it can't be a fighting game.
8202440	8206400	I am really holding off until I find something, something that is tried and true that others
8206400	8212720	have used with certainty that I can easily buy in my local Best Buy that same day.
8212720	8216880	Most of the TVs now, as long as you are not buying a bargain basement TV, most of the
8216880	8219680	TVs now you are not going to have a problem with that.
8219680	8223720	The technology is much better now and you don't really have that same type of lag.
8223720	8229480	They know that people want HDTVs to play video games, so a lot of them advertise very low
8229480	8230480	lag.
8230480	8235640	Right, but that is contrary to what I am hearing in the Shoryuken forums on the big fighting
8235640	8238320	game community site.
8238320	8248000	In their tech talk section, they do have threads for sub one frame high def TVs.
8248000	8253600	Most of them are either available or they are just discontinued, but for the most part
8253600	8256760	it is monitors that are damn near lagless.
8256760	8260260	You have some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
8260260	8264980	Shining Force 3inator, hey that name is going to get you arrested, says, I put up a thread
8264980	8269220	on the vlog boards with some PS3, PSN recommendations.
8269220	8271780	Brad from Pod Culture is suggesting a Vizio.
8271780	8277140	Go Vizio, it is the best bang for your buck, not at Best Buy, Wally World or Costco.
8277140	8279340	I am not going to Wal-Mart.
8279340	8280340	I got mine at Costco.
8280340	8282340	I actually had a great experience at Costco, I can't complain.
8282340	8289860	I just need something that I can play 2DX on in an occasional fight game that is fast
8289860	8294500	that I don't have to offset for timing.
8294500	8297220	And then I would pick up a high FTV amount on my wall.
8297220	8301740	And then maybe someday Konami will put out, now that they have gone HD with 2DX, they
8301740	8306000	will actually put out all they have missed on like one Uber Playstation 3 game, at least
8306000	8307000	we can dream.
8307000	8308000	Sure.
8308000	8309000	Sure.
8309000	8310000	Right.
8310000	8313060	And that is the day when like pigs fly from the skyline.
8313060	8314060	Exactly.
8314060	8316540	That is the day when Rock Revolution 2 is announced.
8316540	8320180	Alright Zaku, I got to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call and I hope
8320180	8321180	you do get the PS3.
8321180	8322180	Good luck.
8322180	8323180	Alright.
8323180	8325180	Alright, take care buddy.
8325180	8326180	Bye.
8326180	8328820	I like the video.
8328820	8332980	I want more people to call in with video even though it is a radio show, at least I am amused.
8332980	8335820	But please, for the love of God, make sure you are decent if you are going to call in
8335820	8336820	on video.
8336820	8342140	Alright, Loki, any other stories?
8342140	8346300	Microsoft Vancouver is now Black Tusk Studios and apparently they are working on the next
8346300	8348060	big franchise for the Xbox.
8348060	8351220	Oh, like something for the new Xbox maybe?
8351220	8355260	Just whatever the next big AAA franchise is going to be.
8355260	8358340	What could it be?
8358340	8362500	Going to the Twitters at Twitter.com slash OLR, Spazinator wants to know, what are the
8362500	8366060	odds of a Gangnam style parody with a Mass Effect theme?
8366060	8367060	Garris style anyone?
8367060	8368260	You mean that hasn't already been done?
8368260	8369260	That could easily be done.
8369260	8370260	It has been done.
8370260	8372260	Check out, there is this thing called Tumblr.
8373260	8376900	I was going to say, it is definitely possible now that they have the JibJab app or whatever
8376900	8380220	you can upload pictures of people.
8380220	8386540	So true story, the other day I was looking up YouTube videos and I found myself on Psy
8386540	8389540	and I was like, I wonder if his other music is any good and I was looking at one of his
8389540	8392340	other songs and I was like alright, that's kind of cool.
8392340	8393340	Passionate Goodbye is really good.
8393340	8397540	And then if you look on the right side at all the related videos, it was all of these
8397540	8399900	Psy videos, like Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy.
8399900	8404580	But then there was this one video towards the top, Hippopotamus takes a massive dump
8404580	8407580	at the zoo.
8407580	8411660	Guess which one I clicked?
8411660	8419260	And I was like, this is more interesting than the Psy video.
8419260	8421460	Alright.
8421460	8423620	Did you hear that Glee did Gangnam Style?
8423620	8424620	Oh God.
8424620	8426360	Do they actually speak Korean?
8426360	8427360	I don't know.
8427360	8428800	I'm sure it's terrible.
8428840	8433220	When I was discovering Adventure Time last night, after five seasons of not ever watching
8433220	8438600	any of it, I found that someone did an Adventure Time Gangnam Style.
8438600	8439600	Good Lord.
8439600	8443800	Really the one you should look up is the Gangnam Style crossed with Too Legit to Quit with
8443800	8444800	NC Hammer.
8444800	8455600	I'm not sure who's speaking Korean.
8455600	8459760	That just sounds wrong.
8459760	8460760	Let's go to the phones.
8460760	8461960	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8461960	8462960	Who's this?
8462960	8464960	This is Haseo Sumuragawa.
8464960	8468760	Hey, how are you doing?
8468760	8470280	I'm doing pretty well.
8470280	8472280	What's on your mind, Haseo Sumuragawa?
8472280	8483960	Well, I was putting my plate bid for the trophy course among the listeners.
8484680	8485680	Wait, wait.
8485680	8489320	You're putting in your bid for being a trophy whore among the listeners?
8489320	8496320	Just a small recommendation.
8496320	8503120	It's supremely cheap to, if you haven't played them yet, to pick up the God of War saga.
8503120	8513880	Then it's the three main games on disc and you get a download voucher for the PSP collection.
8513880	8517760	And I bet you can find that pretty cheap these days because that God of War collection
8517760	8519120	came out a couple years ago.
8519120	8524040	We actually have it too.
8524040	8529640	They recently re-released it as the God of War saga because it originally was the God
8529640	8536760	of War HD collection which was one and two and then that came out right in time for three
8536760	8544240	or round three and then they came out HD collection which was Change of Olympus and
8544240	8545240	Ghost of Sparta.
8545240	8549800	But with the God of War saga, you get all five games.
8549800	8551840	So you say you're the resident trophy whore.
8551840	8554080	What is your PlayStation level?
8554080	8556280	14.
8556280	8557280	That's pretty good.
8557280	8561440	I think I'm only at like seven or eight, but I don't, I mean, you know, do you play other
8561440	8567160	consoles or like just, are you like only Sony in your house?
8567160	8573880	Only Sony, but you know, I'm thinking about maybe picking up a 360 to check out, you know,
8573880	8589480	like the games I miss on 360 such as Halo and Gears of War because I hear good things.
8589480	8593920	You've been talking a little bit tonight about how a lot of people have been overlooking
8593920	8595720	some of the good stuff that Sony's doing.
8595720	8599460	Like it doesn't seem like a lot of people tend to care about Move and there's so much
8599460	8602760	good stuff on PlayStation Network that tends to go overlooked.
8602760	8607640	As somebody who's a bit of a Sony fan, what do you think people are missing by not giving
8607640	8612120	Sony more credit?
8612120	8621080	First of all, the first three games such as God of War, Infamous, and the entire series
8621080	8626040	are all really great series.
8626040	8637280	And I mean, even like the download games like Journey, as you mentioned earlier, and Flow
8637280	8641840	and Flower, they're truly great games.
8641840	8647520	And not to mention the PS3 has been getting a whole lot of the collections compared to
8647520	8648520	the 360.
8648520	8649520	I gotcha.
8649520	8650520	Yeah, it's true.
8650520	8655840	They put it, they put a lot of that good stuff, like all those collections out on disc.
8655840	8658520	It makes a good point to like a good starting point.
8658520	8662840	Like the Journey collection, you know, has Flower and Flow and all that would be a great
8662840	8664960	starting point for somebody.
8664960	8665960	Yes.
8666960	8677680	Plus, with that, I mean, if I remember correctly, because my friend bought it, it was $30 plus
8677680	8684440	you got a free month of PlayStation Plus and a whole bunch of player IDs and I think even
8684440	8685440	a theme.
8685440	8686440	Nice.
8686440	8687440	Very cool.
8687440	8688440	All right.
8688440	8695600	Well, before we let you go, is there anything else you want to share with us tonight?
8695640	8698560	No, the coin's revenge could have been better.
8698560	8701360	How so?
8701360	8707360	It was too short and they kind of ended it a different way than I was expecting.
8707360	8708360	All right.
8708360	8710360	Well, no giving away the ending.
8710360	8711360	All right.
8711360	8712360	Well, take care, buddy.
8712360	8713360	Thanks a lot for the call.
8713360	8714360	No problem.
8714360	8715360	All right.
8715360	8716360	Bye bye.
8716360	8721640	1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8721640	8725160	Somebody there is sticking up for the PlayStation 3 and giving some more recommendations there.
8725160	8728440	For the record, I have to say Meg C and Kristin say hi.
8728440	8732720	Hello and please ask when they're coming to California because we miss them.
8732720	8733720	Okay, I will.
8733720	8737560	There is a whole new generation of OLR listeners that have no idea who the OLR lesbians are
8737560	8738780	and they need to be introduced.
8738780	8739780	They need to return.
8739780	8741280	That's right.
8741280	8743760	Remind them the episode 500 is coming up.
8743760	8745760	All right.
8745760	8750080	1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8750080	8752880	A couple of tweets from SSJ100Matt.
8752880	8755240	An idea ahead of its time from Sega.
8755240	8760840	Arcade Heroes takes a look back at the Sega Super Circuit from 1989.
8760840	8767640	It links us to a story from Arcade Heroes, which I'll get to in a minute after this call.
8767640	8769800	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8769800	8770800	Who's this?
8770800	8771800	Word, dog.
8771800	8772800	It's Jim Sally.
8772800	8773800	Holy crap.
8773800	8774800	Holy crap.
8774800	8775800	It's video.
8775800	8776800	Oh my God.
8776800	8777800	Jim Sally's on the video.
8777800	8778800	Are you in the bathroom?
8778800	8782440	It's just with him moving back and forth and all that.
8782440	8783440	Well, no.
8783440	8784440	That wall looks like tile, like bathroom.
8784440	8785440	Oh no.
8785440	8786440	It's, I see.
8786440	8788440	It did have a little bit of that vibe of the sitting on the toilet video.
8788440	8789440	Sitting on the toilet.
8789440	8790440	Oh my.
8790440	8791440	Dude, you're on a roof.
8791440	8792440	It's the Canadian skyline.
8792440	8793440	He's outdoors smoking.
8793440	8794440	That's what they do in Canada.
8794440	8795440	I don't know what I'm doing.
8795440	8796440	This could be anything.
8796440	8797440	Those might give you cancer.
8797440	8798440	All right.
8798440	8799440	No, it's organic.
8799440	8800440	Oh, it's a toothpick.
8800440	8801440	Oh, it's floss.
8801440	8802440	Clearly.
8802440	8803440	It's a toothpick.
8803440	8804440	It's a toothpick.
8804440	8805440	It's a toothpick.
8805440	8806440	It's a toothpick.
8806440	8807440	It's a toothpick.
8807440	8808440	It's a toothpick.
8809080	8812920	That's clearly, all right, so that means that he has wonderful, a dental hygiene or
8812920	8813920	something.
8813920	8814920	All right.
8814920	8815920	Jim Sally.
8815920	8817840	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8817840	8818840	Not much, man.
8818840	8819840	It's a long time.
8819840	8820840	No C. I thought I'd call in say what's up.
8820840	8821840	So you make sure things.
8821840	8823520	Okay, I'm doing my, I'm doing my time to get here, man.
8823520	8829200	Look, I'm all dressed up for the occasion looking fly.
8829200	8830200	Thank you.
8830200	8832620	Thank you for wearing clothes.
8832620	8834600	When you call it to the show.
8834600	8835600	Cause I'm afraid.
8835600	8837760	One of these days I am disappointed at the, no, I'm kidding.
8837760	8838760	Stop.
8838760	8839760	I'm afraid that one.
8839760	8840760	Dude, look at those guns.
8840760	8844140	Jim, it's a radio show.
8844140	8845640	They're not going to be able to see your muscles.
8845640	8847640	That was just for you Rob.
8847640	8849840	He's invited us to the gun show.
8849840	8852040	You know what I'm saying?
8852040	8853700	Here's my fan boy hearts and eyes.
8853700	8855480	I wish we don't have a webcam in return.
8855480	8856680	I can't, we'll get one.
8856680	8857680	We're going to get a webcam.
8857680	8861920	I like to just hear your soft voice anyway, buddy.
8861920	8865080	The webcam is at my house.
8865080	8869760	Looks like I'm looking at you in the, in the studio right now.
8869760	8870760	Here's me.
8870760	8874540	I'm going to give you a kiss on the cheek.
8874540	8876840	This is great radio guys.
8876840	8877840	Great radio.
8877840	8878840	Smiley.
8878840	8879840	I am.
8879840	8880840	Okay.
8880840	8881840	Let's do radio.
8881840	8882840	Let's do radio.
8882840	8883840	Let's go.
8883840	8884840	Jim, what kind of games have you been into lately?
8884840	8885840	Oh man.
8885840	8887040	You guys talked about the golden accent too long ago.
8887040	8889080	The great golden X game on the Sega.
8889080	8892520	Oh, I do remember playing that game and being vicious with my friends.
8892520	8896800	We used to play only two players at a time you could have, but there was three of us.
8896800	8899400	So whoever died would have to hand the controller off to the guy sitting out.
8899400	8902080	And that was pretty much how we played the game the whole time.
8902080	8903480	There were a lot of punch buggies, man.
8903480	8906720	We used to freak out when those little trolls would come out and who got to kill the trolls.
8906720	8910280	We would usually kill each other and then never get to the second level.
8910280	8913920	That's a hilarious style of gaming I haven't seen since I was young.
8913920	8917520	But yeah, we used to do that too with like Mario brothers is that up you died, hand off
8917520	8918520	the controller.
8918520	8919520	That's right.
8919520	8920520	Someone else's turn.
8920520	8921520	I think that's from the arcade, right?
8921520	8922520	Because you die.
8922520	8923640	Someone else gets to put a quarter in.
8923640	8924640	That's true.
8924640	8927640	It's very true.
8927640	8928640	Good times of gold night.
8928640	8931240	You know, I was thinking back when dark soccer was talking about golden X and I was like,
8931240	8937640	you know, all things considered golden X actually wasn't very good, but when we were younger,
8937640	8938640	it was the shit.
8938640	8943320	And it was so much fun to play in the arcades and not to spoil a 20 year old game or whatever,
8943320	8947280	but the ending was great with all the characters actually jumping out of the arcade machine.
8947280	8948280	Remember that?
8948280	8949280	That was hilarious.
8949280	8950280	That was an awesome ending.
8950280	8951280	It was very-
8951280	8952280	So worth it.
8952280	8953280	Fourth wall.
8953280	8955520	Oh my God.
8955520	8957000	He has a hat that says Jim Sally.
8957000	8959360	It says, dude, I have a whole line of hats that say Jim Sally.
8959360	8960360	Here, check it out.
8960360	8964160	Is that like a clothing line we can check out on, on a cafe press?
8964160	8967160	You have to tell me what texture you're using because it looks kind of like Cooper, but
8967160	8968160	not really.
8968160	8970720	Um, I think that this was like jungle use or something.
8970720	8971720	I don't know.
8971720	8974760	I use different texts, whatever they have at the, I use lids.
8974760	8977840	You need to do a Helvetica one and make it look extra design.
8977840	8980120	This show is getting too nerdy for me.
8980120	8982600	Um, Rob just doesn't know typography.
8982600	8986120	I love though that we're getting a little glimpse of Canadian right there.
8986120	8988080	I hope you don't get, is that snow on the ground?
8988080	8989080	Dude, look at this.
8989080	8991080	I had to shovel this shit, man.
8991080	8992080	Oh my.
8992080	8993080	Just not too long ago.
8993080	8994080	Look.
8994080	8995080	Yeah dude, it got, it was, it was-
8995080	8996400	What's that white mythical stuff?
8996400	8997600	We're from California.
8997600	8998600	Like I'm like, Ooh, what is that?
8998600	8999600	No.
8999600	9001260	Rob, for the record, it does snow in Alabama.
9001260	9005160	And it does snow 45 minutes up the hill here in California because we are, we are like
9005160	9007560	two less than two hours away from Lake Tahoe.
9007560	9010000	So I can handle the cold though.
9010000	9011360	Look at what you get when you shovel the snow.
9011360	9012360	Look at those.
9012360	9013360	Look at those.
9013360	9014360	All right.
9014360	9018680	Jim, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call.
9018680	9019680	Don't be a stranger.
9019680	9020680	I'm glad to hear from you.
9020680	9021840	Listen, I'm glad to hear from you guys too.
9021840	9024200	And I just want to say that I'm an angel.
9024200	9026200	Look at this light shining in my face.
9026200	9034760	I'm coming down for Christmas time and I'm telling you be good to everybody you see because
9034760	9042520	I'm watching you and I got a big eye, you better look up, you better look up.
9042520	9043520	All right.
9043520	9045040	Before this turns into the Blair Witch Project.
9045040	9047760	This Jim Sali call is brought to you by toothpicks.
9047760	9048760	Who knows what's in them?
9048760	9049760	All right.
9049760	9050760	Take care, buddy.
9050760	9051760	Love you, Rob Roberts.
9051760	9052760	Love you, Loki.
9052760	9053760	Love you, JB.
9053760	9063320	I can tell my husband I kissed another man tonight.
9063320	9069920	I think video is going to have to be a requirement pretty soon as long as I'm not on it.
9069920	9070920	It's fine.
9070920	9071920	We can point the camera over here.
9071920	9072920	All right.
9072920	9075280	No, I think it was a toothpick.
9075280	9077320	It was something or it was weed.
9077320	9078320	I don't know.
9078320	9079320	All right.
9079320	9081360	I got more tweets.
9081360	9082360	Who cares?
9082360	9084400	Uh, let's see.
9084400	9085640	What am I looking at here?
9085640	9086640	Uh, yes.
9086640	9089960	This was the tweet that SSG100 Matt sent before that call.
9090600	9096920	There's a lot here, but it had to do with RC cars on a track and let me see if I can
9096920	9097920	open this.
9097920	9102040	Actually, let me open this on the, um, this is why I should not use my iPad to do Twitter
9102040	9107080	topics because then I don't have the YouTube hooked up to the stream.
9107080	9108080	The tubes of you.
9108080	9109080	I know, right?
9109080	9110080	Uh, crap.
9110080	9116640	No, it'll make a mess.
9116640	9117760	The joys of live radio.
9117760	9123360	I'm logging in right now to the right Twitter account cause I, I'm have like four different
9123360	9125560	Twitter accounts.
9125560	9126560	Let's go look at this.
9126560	9128960	I wanted to look at the YouTube that was attached to this.
9128960	9130760	Okay, here we go.
9130760	9140720	What is this?
9140720	9144600	This is Sega super circuit.
9144600	9150920	You used deluxe outrun cabinets that allowed players to control an RC car on a large track
9150920	9157400	that was set up next to the units and using cameras mounted to the cars.
9157400	9159480	You got a first person view of your vehicle.
9159480	9161640	That is the best thing ever.
9161640	9162640	That's pretty awesome.
9162640	9165060	You know, Dan would flip his shit for this.
9165060	9166060	This is 1989.
9166060	9168240	I hope my God, look at the video.
9168240	9169240	That is so adorable.
9169240	9170240	Dude.
9170240	9173040	That is completely flip his shit for this.
9173040	9174040	Oh my God.
9174480	9176920	That is so rad.
9176920	9182040	And it keeps breaking up when the car runs into the wall.
9182040	9183100	That is cool.
9183100	9184840	It's like you should link that to the listeners.
9184840	9191840	You really can become a miniature person.
9191840	9192840	I love that.
9192840	9195440	Rob, I found a haiku from a friend of mine on tumblr.
9195440	9198400	We're making Rama work overtime with the tumblr tonight, by the way.
9198400	9201760	All the links I've been talking about during the show, I'm making Rama put on the tumblr.
9201760	9202760	So check that out.
9202760	9204640	That is so cool.
9204640	9207320	This is actually how I feel about group projects.
9207320	9209120	So I'm going to read this haiku, Rob.
9209120	9210120	Okay.
9210120	9211120	I hate group projects.
9211120	9212720	Just let me do it myself.
9212720	9215520	Everyone else sucks.
9215520	9219320	Everyone else sucks.
9219320	9221960	Haikus are easy, but sometimes they don't make sense.
9221960	9225920	Haiku does not take an S to make it plural.
9225920	9230680	Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion creator, Ron Gilbert, wants the game rights back, according
9230680	9233800	to another tweet from SSJ100Matt.
9233800	9234800	Makes sense.
9234800	9237560	I'm assuming this has to do with the whole Disney acquisition.
9237560	9242640	Quote, yeah, I wish I owned Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion, you know.
9242640	9247800	It just seems to be a company that hoards IP, and that kind of worries me.
9247800	9250120	Doesn't think that he'll get those franchises back.
9250120	9251120	Good luck, buddy.
9251120	9252320	Hope you...
9252320	9255000	If they don't give them back to you, I hope it's because they're going to do something
9255000	9258480	with it, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.
9258480	9259480	Well guess what?
9259480	9260480	You know what I just did?
9260480	9261480	What's that?
9261480	9263360	I signed up for a Mojang account.
9263360	9264960	Uh oh.
9264960	9265960	I'm not buying the game.
9265960	9266960	Uh oh.
9266960	9267960	I'm preparing for somebody else to buy me the game.
9267960	9269200	You need to at least play the beta.
9269200	9270680	All right.
9270680	9277160	On the Tiger Claw tweets, hate using the classic controller on the Wii U?
9277160	9279280	Use the PlayStation 2s instead.
9279280	9282400	Apparently there's a conversion kit that's going to be going on sale in Japan that will
9282400	9285760	allow you to connect a DualShock to the Wii U.
9285760	9289000	You know, if you don't want to use the classic controller or what have you.
9289000	9290000	The kit's from Datel.
9290000	9293500	It'll cost about $25 or 1,980 yen.
9293500	9295960	It goes on sale December 8th.
9295960	9297960	No idea if this will be sold elsewhere.
9297960	9303200	That's so cool that you would spend more money on a conversion kit than the actual controller.
9303200	9305840	Six axis all the things.
9305840	9307800	All right.
9307800	9308800	Let's see.
9308800	9315360	And also from Tiger Claw, Miyamoto wonders, is story really necessary when gameplay will
9315360	9316840	do?
9316840	9320960	Well, just based on title alone, I haven't even looked at the story.
9320960	9326720	I think an ideal game has both, but Atari 2600 games, I guess, didn't really have a
9326720	9327720	lot of story.
9327720	9329640	Well, they did if you read the instruction manual.
9329640	9335760	Sometimes you had to to visualize that stuff, but let's see.
9335760	9337920	This is a link to a story from Gamasutra.
9337920	9341680	Again, I'm having to read this live because we just got linked to it on Twitter, but looking
9341680	9344100	at the quote here from Miyamoto.
9344100	9349280	With regard to the story, we did a survey over the Super Paper Mario game in Club Nintendo,
9349280	9352300	and not even 1% said the story was interesting.
9352300	9356740	A lot of people said that the flip move for switching between the 3D and the 2D dimensions
9356740	9358580	was fun.
9358580	9359780	Hmm.
9359780	9361300	Who's this?
9361300	9365500	Taro Kudo, the creator of scenario design on the game said, quote, I didn't think we
9365500	9368380	necessarily needed a lengthy story like in an RPG.
9368380	9372060	Instead, we looked at the characteristics of a portable game that can be played little
9372060	9375980	by little in small pieces and packed in lots of little episodes and ideas.
9375980	9379540	I always did like putting in little ideas, so I actually enjoyed it.
9379540	9390180	A good game doesn't need story, but you know, it's nice to have if the type of genre necessitates
9390180	9391180	it.
9391180	9395740	Like, you know, a football game might not necessarily need story, but could a story
9395740	9397140	make it more awesome?
9397140	9401500	That's what makes wrestling games awesome, because it's like soap operas for broly dudes.
9401500	9407580	And lastly, from Degenerate Johnny tonight, OLR, which is faster, running or rolling?
9407580	9411940	Well, if you're a monk in World of Warcraft, rolling will give you a temporary speed boost
9411940	9414100	if you spec the right talent for it.
9414100	9415100	Dark.
9415100	9418660	Depends if it's uphill or downhill.
9418660	9421260	That's a good question.
9421260	9424740	If it's a flat surface, I would think running is probably going to be a little faster.
9424740	9428300	But yes, if you're going downhill, rolling might actually be more advantageous.
9428300	9430060	And dangerous.
9430060	9431380	Consider your terrain.
9431380	9432500	Running and rolling.
9432500	9435020	That was a Street Fighter Alpha 3 ending.
9435020	9437660	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9437660	9439140	That's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight.
9439140	9441220	Does that do it for Last Minute Stories as well?
9441220	9442220	Yes.
9442220	9444940	And that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9444940	9447220	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show.
9447220	9449700	We really appreciate your guys' support every single week.
9449700	9452460	Yeah, I know it's a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but you know what?
9452460	9455860	The last few have all been like three and a half hour epic episodes.
9455860	9460940	So you know, a short one as the news is winding down for the year, I don't think is too bad.
9460940	9464500	We are moving in, of course, to the year end in another year of Orange Lounge Radio.
9464500	9469660	And we couldn't have done it for the past coming up on 11 years without your support.
9469660	9473220	And you know, all we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
9473220	9475540	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
9475540	9479800	Word of mouth is all we got, and it's worked out pretty well for us.
9479800	9483340	Before we pull the plug on the show, it's time to go around and get everybody's final
9483340	9484860	thoughts tonight.
9484860	9485860	I'll start.
9485860	9493420	Our final thought tonight is, Fog of World is a very interesting app on the iPhone, but
9493420	9495260	$5?
9495260	9499100	Have I just been spoiled by all the 99 cent stuff that's available on IOS?
9499100	9501100	I think $5 is a little much.
9501100	9503180	Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?
9503180	9507300	I've decided that if I'm ever going to wear a watch again, it's going to be the Hello
9507300	9509300	Kitty Nuka watch.
9509300	9512420	Nuka makes awesome watches, just saying.
9512420	9516620	And lastly but not leastly, Loki.
9516620	9520660	I hope I get this stupid Mavarina plug-in working, because it's really frustrating me.
9520660	9523340	It's giving me a headache.
9523340	9524340	All right.
9524340	9526140	That does it for another episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9526140	9529300	We will be back to do it all again next week.
9529300	9533140	And since we learned tonight that it is starting before the next show, happy Hanukkah to our
9533140	9535060	listeners out there who celebrate it.
9535060	9536060	Yep.
9536060	9537060	Happy Hanukkah.
9537060	9538060	There you go.
9538060	9539060	Have a great week, everybody.
9539060	9540300	We'll see you next time on Orange.
