14141	24899	Tonight, December 2nd, 2012, a new Wii console is unveiled, a classic console is reborn on iPhone and iPad, and could Sony be planning a break-apart controller for the next PlayStation?
31977	34179	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
58197	59197	How are you, Jamie Summers?
59517	59977	Doing alright.
60177	60437	Yeah?
60778	60978	Yeah.
61158	61878	What's new with you?
62518	63998	Hanukkah's coming up real quick, isn't it?
64498	66419	Yeah, I think it starts the 9th.
66879	67159	Yeah.
68139	71220	So I've got to... Wait, are you going to be here next week if it starts the 9th?
71960	72820	We better figure that out.
73120	76061	I need to find out if the temple is having something.
76081	79702	Well, I'll verify the dates and... I'm glad I thought to ask.
79822	86183	Well, no, because usually my temple does something for the first and whatever, you know, Shabbat is during Hanukkah.
86443	86603	Right.
87063	99333	Um, so I'd have to find out, but I mean, it's, I'm already getting out my little, uh, I have this, uh, thing I got at Target of all places that's like little felt candles and you can put them up on the, this, uh, banner.
100013	102655	I'm already getting some of the decorations out of all places.
102695	107218	The grocery outlet had six pointed blue Christmas ornaments.
107679	109540	So I was like, I'm going to use these.
110181	110461	Why not?
110741	110981	Yeah.
111902	113063	So hooray.
113328	113608	All right.
113648	117309	We'll also say hello to Tech Master Loki joining us here in studio.
117429	118069	How are you, Loki?
118269	118950	I'm fine.
119070	120970	McDonald's again during the show.
121030	122111	Is that like... It's cheap.
122171	123431	It's like your standard thing now.
123591	125632	Well, it's cheap and I was over there running errands.
126012	126292	Oh, okay.
126532	128352	Not at McDonald's, but in the plaza with McDonald's.
129193	130053	I need a Big Mac.
130433	130793	Stat.
132327	133928	All right, what else is new with you?
134568	141250	Now I'm still trying to fix the Minecraft server, trying to get this one plug-in mob arena to work correctly.
141850	144511	And I fixed... There was an error in the config file.
144531	145532	I fixed that.
145752	148673	It's still not accepting any of the commands, though, so...
149853	150093	I don't know.
170504	171265	Josh's First Gaming Experience
190024	193328	And he likes hitting the button to make the bubbles blow from the dinosaur.
194049	194950	That's how we started.
195371	200977	Does anyone remember, does anyone in studio maybe remember, like, what turned them on to video games in the first place?
201018	206684	Like, I know you have to have, like, a really young memory for most of us, because I know most of us started in, like, the Coleco Atari era or whatever.
206985	207766	But does anybody remember...
208466	221254	For me, I don't remember a lot being a kid, but I think the fact that I could control what was on the television, besides just the remote, but I could actually make my own TV show of sorts, was kind of what turned me on to gaming.
221634	222975	I don't remember what it was exactly.
223735	229359	For the record, Hanukkah starts on the 8th, so I was right in general as far as daytime goes.
230299	232121	But there's nothing going on, so I'll be here.
232321	233661	Okay, phew, just checking.
233702	234702	I'll let my candle before I go.
234782	237624	Because if I needed a guest host, I like to know that stuff in advance.
238103	238663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
267802	275067	So if you've never listened to Bobby's show before, you're missing a little kind of bonus segment with us, for lack of a better term, at the end of his show every week.
276268	276988	And it's a good show.
277368	279370	The other 50 minutes of the show are great, too.
279430	280851	He's one guy talking about games.
281291	283732	I just like to give him a nice little plug there every now and then.
283833	290237	And you can check out all the great shows that make up the lineup of the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.
290257	292098	Again, that's vognetwork.com.
292278	292538	DarkSakura.com
311335	319498	I don't know about this because thanks to the Omega DLC this week, you might be going for girls this time, right?
320818	323819	Well, she's dead, so I mean... Don't spoil!
323839	324299	Oh my gosh!
324319	325599	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
325619	326180	Oh my god.
326200	331801	She's only in the DLC, I'll put it that way.
333462	335902	So it's only a moment, and I just appreciate it.
335922	340824	Clearly she has still some residual going on for Miss Arya.
342085	344647	Yeah, there is a little bit of tension going on there, isn't there?
344767	347069	My favorite line, I love it when you're feisty.
347370	347690	Wink.
348911	351953	Acidic Vampire has changed the line to Mrs. Kandros.
352414	352874	There you go.
353375	355436	No, no, Vicarian.
356377	357458	You know what this is going to turn into?
357478	368267	This is going to turn into a freaking TV series like they have with Grey's Anatomy or something like that where it's going to be on a starship and it's just going to be drama and people sleeping with each other because that's all that Mass Effect is really.
368487	370509	That and a third person shooter, but
371527	372147	and Grunt.
393996	394656	Moving on.
394676	396617	I actually, I will say this.
396637	398858	We're going to get into our gaming week soon enough.
399218	399758	I will say this.
400718	411121	Just to make Loki happy with my fandom coming full circle, I did place my order, my $60 order, for the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation 3, which will be shipped the day the game is launched.
411481	412942	Well, now it's complete.
414442	441572	that means the only system I don't have it on now is Wii U but I'm gonna I'm holding off on that until they fix some of the DLC which I do need to issue an errata you know heaven forbid we ever misspeak on Orange Launch Radio and I say something wrong but I did last week I said that none of the multiplayer DLC was available on Mass Effect 3 Wii U that is incorrect it does include the first three multiplayer download packs but I believe it is missing this most recent one still so
442713	444814	It is still missing something that the other consoles have.
445035	449338	But it's still lame, the options that you're not allowed to carry over.
450199	451700	Yeah, that's a whole other thing.
452000	455643	Which people will get to hear once a certain podcast is available.
456804	460847	Be careful, I'll have you taken out and back and roughed up too, like a chatter who was trying to spoil it earlier.
462168	464050	But what was I going to say about all that?
464810	467813	I don't know if this is just rumor or fan wank or what, but supposedly...
468693	472117	Mass Effect 3 Wii U is selling better than BioWare had anticipated.
472518	476723	So they are looking at... I mean, I guess that kind of stuff is always a possibility.
477183	480367	We only thought we'd sell a copy and we sold two.
480607	481088	Who knows?
481188	481568	Who knows?
482229	482509	All right.
482830	484332	Anyhow, let's move on.
484952	486514	I want to do a kickoff topic real quick.
487495	489056	You call this a storm?
489456	490297	This land is your land
506485	507666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
535103	537766	But I've also got some games coming in from my rental service.
538226	541890	I'm going to give Forza a try because some of our VOG fans have been talking about it.
542371	544012	And whatever else they end up sending me.
544413	544873	So I don't know.
544893	546055	Is there any catch-up games?
546715	548157	Loki, you were talking about before the show.
548177	550019	Like, I have all these games I haven't even touched.
550834	553277	Well, yeah, it's because I just remembered to go through.
553397	560444	I was adding all my Steam codes for the Humble Bundles I have and stuff, like past ones.
560825	562547	There's some that I haven't even redeemed yet.
562967	564729	And most of them I have not played yet.
564769	571316	And even the stuff from the summer sale or whatever, most of the games that I've bought there, I have not played.
572097	575258	So, I have a ton of games I could be playing.
575738	585482	And then on top of that, you know, just the stuff that I did buy and played a little bit of, you know, on console that I still have to play more and, you know, more Minecraft.
585922	587723	So I got plenty of stuff to keep me busy.
588821	595547	Jim Sally in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Actually, Rob, Walking Dead is on now on the East Coast, and I'm skipping it for you.
596167	597268	I guess apparently it's on at 9.
598209	600811	Well, thank you guys for skipping that show to come be with us.
600851	608337	That's why they invented DVR and Hulu and other ways to watch TV shows later on, even though I have yet to watch any Walking Dead.
608377	609158	I'm not hating on it.
609198	614983	I hardly watch any TV shows unless it's RuPaul's Drag Race or Happy Endings, actually.
615023	616124	I strangely like that show.
616544	616924	It's weird.
617085	617305	Anyway.
618546	620647	DarkSakura, anything that you're trying to catch up on?
621508	629413	Well, I've been trying to get my newly purchased copy of Sonic Generations to download because I've really wanted to play that game and I got it way cheap on Steam.
629753	630414	Love Steam.
631394	635077	I'm playing that stupid Fairy Solitaire game because I want to beat it this year.
636318	644643	But other than that, I mean, oh, I got another game that just looks so cool to me and it had been kind of on my radar for a little bit but I finally just broke down and bought it.
644663	645764	It's a game called Closure.
646769	676223	I haven't played it yet where it's basically it's all black and white and it uses the light to create your area around you so basically wherever the light shines it exists if the light isn't shining there it doesn't exist meaning you can create holes in the ground and drop down into other levels and it's a really neat application of physics so it's been on my radar for a little while and I've wanted to play it so I finally just downloaded it other than that I'm playing my usual
677233	677734	There you go.
678514	679155	I touched well.
680417	680957	It liked it.
681758	684341	You pretty much just did your gaming week together with a question, didn't you?
684361	686744	Yeah, because a lot of it's combined.
686824	688386	I've downloaded the stuff, I've prepped it.
689146	690808	Now it just is a matter of sitting down and playing it.
691029	694332	You were talking a little bit about Project Greenlight stuff before the show.
694392	695734	Is that something you've been participating with?
695934	699796	I'm looking to see what the new stuff coming in is and if it interests me or not.
699857	702098	I've watched the trailers for a few things and I was like, eh, crap.
702958	703979	It just hadn't interested me.
704179	705320	I've got like one thing.
705520	710303	Not every idea is something you're going to jump up and go woo at, but there's some good things on there.
710443	711724	I've been poking around in there too.
712685	718828	The other thing going on is that I want to hook up the Dreamcast and actually I've had this urge to play through Grandia 2 again.
719529	723031	So I'm thinking about playing it or the SNES and playing through Earthbound.
723720	726862	Yeah, I was thinking about revisiting some classics too.
727183	727543	I don't know.
727703	734788	I thought it would be fun to get one of those little streaming things for the TV and do a little streaming session of a game.
735028	740913	That's something I've been talking about for forever and it's one of those new media things that we've completely missed the boat on.
740973	741993	You know what we should do?
742814	744035	We should actually play through Secret of Mana.
744824	746665	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
776080	792641	this week I played Black Ops 2 but more we finally finished up playing all the multiplayer maps and now we're just kind of going back and playing whatever we want to play and I finished the single player campaign which actually ended kind of short it was starting to get really good and then it's like and done
793682	800844	It's like that one that they were showing kind of in all the trailers and stuff where all the drones are attacking LA and that kind of thing.
800984	803225	That's the second to last mission of the game.
803885	810267	And so right after that, it's like, oh, we're going to attack where the source is coming from and game over.
810667	812188	It's like, okay, that was...
812848	839544	and I guess there's multiple endings to the game but dude I don't even know like all the different things that you do in the game there's only like a it must have been like three maybe two second clip it's like something happens and then I guess that changes based on how you play the game so woohoo a five second clip that I you know affected by playing the game differently in different spots
840304	840624	I don't know.
840864	841545	It's just kind of weird.
841885	844906	I probably wouldn't go back and replay through all the campaign again.
846406	847766	But it was fun the first time.
849567	851508	I wish it was longer because it was actually pretty cool.
851768	854388	And it was getting really good.
855049	855609	We're done with that.
857929	859110	Also played Far Cry 3.
860110	861250	That game is fantastic.
862950	864731	Playing through the single player campaign of that.
865211	866031	Very cinematic.
868211	870352	I love the detail in the jungle.
870672	872812	It's pretty awesome for even a console game.
873172	875153	Reminds me a lot of Just Cause 2.
875373	877013	The locale and everything.
877433	880614	Even the AI is kind of stupid sometimes.
880634	881294	Yeah.
881534	882775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
904708	912661	It's kind of an exploit, I guess, but the animals can attack you in a car, so you just drive over the animal with a car.
913061	914844	Oh, we gotta hunt a tiger because it's very dangerous?
915044	915766	Hit it with a car!
915906	917649	PETA's calling and telling you to stop.
918670	919712	PETA can bite my ass.
920017	920877	It's fantastic.
920937	924199	It's like, oh, you're trying to kill me.
924899	929080	I'm going to shoot at you, get you to run back towards me, hop in my car, and then hit you with the car.
929981	931881	Or the same thing with Komodo dragons.
931921	935423	They'll just gang up on you and just boop, boop, back and forth.
936363	937003	And they're dead.
937203	938524	And then we collect their skins.
939064	942505	Or even better is that you get these animals to chase after you.
942545	947467	They run back to one of the outposts that you've taken over, and your men kill them.
948087	954928	or you can hang out at one of those outposts where these animals are normally and they'll just keep spawning and your men will keep killing them and you just loot everything.
955508	957749	Even if one of the guys dies, you just loot him.
959169	959769	It's fantastic.
960269	961990	I just love manipulating all that stuff.
963870	965050	It's a pretty interesting storyline.
965070	970151	I went through one of the first drug trip moments in the game.
970651	972031	That was interesting.
972252	973652	I really liked the way they did it though.
973832	974372	It was pretty cool.
975432	977434	and let's see what else.
977494	978475	A little bit of Minecraft.
978515	981898	Still trying to get this damn plug in the work and it's been pissing me off.
982478	984440	But just some reminder stuff.
984940	989264	We've got, you know, it's at vog-minecraft.com to check out.
989464	997110	Right now it's just a dynamic map, but eventually once I get everything working on the server, I'm going to actually... I'm going to load that site and hope it doesn't break the show as it loads.
997250	998131	It shouldn't break the show.
998451	999212	It's not that bad.
999252	1002395	Wow, it looks like the map has even expanded more since the last time I checked.
1002415	1003156	It's possible.
1003676	1009322	We've been still trying to... We've been running into some things that are not working because I'm loading in so many plugins.
1009422	1017229	Like certain... I think it's a lot of the Craftbook stuff was just causing things to not work right because they have like different...
1018610	1019891	We need to set a night.
1044560	1048222	This is a Minecraft orgy night, but not like an actual orgy.
1048322	1051424	I wanted to do that, but eventually we'll get there.
1052084	1058647	Right now, like I said, I'm trying to set up this arena because I know I've got everything in there and it's pretty awesome.
1058687	1061429	I just need to get this actual hit off the ground.
1061909	1065811	But yeah, you can go to vog-minecraft.com for the 3D map.
1065831	1068332	You can actually poke around and see what people are building and stuff.
1068352	1069972	And you can actually see people when they're in-game.
1070333	1074654	And I think you can even chat with them too through that window, which is kind of neat.
1075535	1078416	I got to ask you about this since you're a Minecraft fan and all the listeners as well.
1078436	1081737	Because I'm sure a lot of the listeners that we have would not have seen this.
1081797	1082778	But it's really funny.
1082818	1086439	I actually found this on Reddit on the gamers community.
1087480	1090561	Have you ever heard of this app that they have on the iPhone called Grindr?
1091181	1091642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1115865	1117686	So somebody messages him out of the blue.
1118327	1120668	Hi, sexy, lovely blue eyes, like the sea.
1120708	1121509	And they send a picture.
1121969	1123670	Any other pictures for me there, sexy?
1124070	1126852	And Steve replies back, hello, sir, how are you?
1126932	1128453	Yes, I have many a picture for you.
1128553	1132876	And sends back a picture with the pig and the lamb, like from the game.
1133216	1134897	Like these are game screenshots.
1134937	1136678	Like you can't mistake this for a video game.
1137518	1140180	And the guy replies back, so very handsome indeed.
1140340	1141301	Do you live on a farm?
1143041	1145023	And Steve replies, I move around a lot.
1145123	1148826	I often have to quickly build shelter out of dirt and cobblestone before sunset.
1149467	1152149	And the guy replies back, so you're a handyman.
1152189	1153551	You must be quite fit too then.
1154111	1155132	Are you into older men?
1155372	1156493	Another picture perhaps?
1157154	1161398	And so another in-game picture comes back and says, you know, I cannot run skeletons and zombies.
1161898	1162959	And the guy like doesn't get it.
1163800	1164361	Want to meet?
1165482	1168465	And so Steve replies, okay, have you got any redstone for a compass?
1168785	1170627	What are your X and Z coordinates?
1171107	1173430	And the guy goes, I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
1173790	1175792	And so the guy replies back with a picture of a compass.
1175972	1177294	Well, obviously the guy's trolling.
1177414	1180917	He's hella trolling, but it's funny that the guy's falling for... Poor guy.
1180997	1182419	I don't think he's falling for me.
1182439	1182779	Come on.
1183280	1183600	You're an idiot.
1184060	1185802	I don't see how anyone can be that stupid.
1186182	1187644	You never know, you never know.
1187724	1200756	Unless, you know, unless he's like... This guy probably knows nothing about... Unless he's like visually impaired or something like that and so his, you know, computer or whatever is reading back the text and he doesn't realize that it's, you know, a picture of a, you know...
1201997	1203157	I have a question though.
1203758	1208659	Can you decide what your character looks like?
1208939	1209139	Yes.
1209459	1209899	Okay, good.
1210479	1211900	Even though I don't own the game.
1211920	1212980	Yes, I play as Zangief.
1214881	1215801	Let me link that in chat.
1215821	1216181	There you go.
1216241	1218682	See if you want to see that for yourself there.
1219162	1221283	Okay, someone did the best thing on Tumblr.
1222843	1229447	They took Garrus and Tali and put them in a horse-drawn carriage and then had Gordon Freeman decorating a tree.
1229547	1231568	You and your fandom need to stop derailing the show.
1231628	1232348	Yes, Loki?
1232768	1239892	Well, one of the other things, I saw an article about how to render Minecraft worlds and stuff like that to pretty awesome 3D images.
1240312	1245775	So I'll probably do that too at some point, maybe on the website once I get this stupid plug in the work.
1247079	1247599	Thanks for watching!
1268586	1296130	um and then also I played uh was it uh Skillrex um or Skrillex I guess the uh Legend of Skrillex or whatever the hell that game was it's some like Skrillex game oh yeah I think that's a news item later yeah but it's pretty awesome it's uh really Skrillex awesome well the game's awesome I think it's kind of cool I mean it's a little bit like Zelda and stuff but it's it's done by the same guy that did the um
1296750	1297750	Perfect Strangers game.
1298110	1300171	Does that have Balki in it?
1300371	1302312	That game was pretty fucking rad.
1302352	1302992	It's pretty awesome.
1303032	1304132	Alright, I give it a pass then.
1304973	1305573	That was it.
1306673	1308094	Alright, My Gaming Week.
1308194	1309254	Not a lot of new stuff.
1309734	1316616	Warcraft got a big patch this week, so I was playing a lot of that because there's upgrades to go for and things for my other show, Horde House.
1317577	1323178	I did play some more Wii U. I played more Super Mario Bros.
1323578	1324839	U. New Super Mario Bros.
1324859	1324879	U.
1325960	1344458	I haven't beat it yet, but I'm getting really close I think I'm on the last level before the castle level And then I hear once you beat it, like any Mario game, it's gonna have all new stuff And I already know these exits have multiple levels and shit So I'm having a good time with it, it's fun Also on the Wii U, I did download something new
1345840	1361313	I decided to kind of try out the process of a download title and so I wanted to download one that looked interesting to me so I checked out Mighty Switch Force Hyperdrive Edition first I gotta say though again with the whole Nintendo LOL online part
1361933	1362934	DarkSakura.com
1381247	1385969	unless you go into download management and say, power off my system when the downloads are done.
1386029	1388611	Like, it's not really proactive about it, so I kind of learned that the hard way.
1388991	1389811	All right, so whatever.
1389831	1391092	I had to wait for the download.
1391712	1396374	Once the thing was finally done downloading, it took four minutes to install.
1397095	1403958	Like, what are you doing where you just downloaded the whole... Now, what are you doing for four minutes to install a game that's only half a gig?
1403978	1405699	Yeah, but the PS3 does the same thing.
1406671	1408611	It's not as bad, though.
1408772	1411472	PS3, 60 seconds tops for a download game.
1412012	1413132	Four minutes on the Wii U?
1413232	1413533	I don't know.
1413593	1417573	It must be that underclocked CPU that they rumored to have.
1418094	1420514	It was a little clunky, so I was not a fan of that.
1420554	1421454	But whatever.
1422194	1424595	It's not the worst thing I've ever experienced.
1425375	1427036	Again, that's not a slam on the game.
1427816	1430596	I was trying to see what the Wii U download experience would be like.
1431196	1433497	And I was like, all right, well, that's different.
1433897	1437040	All your DS games are gonna come out on Wii U, just wait!
1457677	1470390	What was cool about this is that you can either play with the action going on on the TV and a little radar on your Wii U pad along with the lives and all that, or you can hit a button and have the whole game on the pad.
1470490	1472993	I like those games where you have the option to do one or the other.
1473713	1480458	Um, but the game itself, you're trying to find these five prisoners in a level and they're all anime babes.
1480798	1488403	You're trying to find these prisoners in a level and you have like jump, shoot and switch and the switch will make blocks appear and disappear.
1488783	1517391	and it's either like one way or the other way there's only like two configurations but then it gets more complicated where the blocks might actually be like launchers from like Sonic the Hedgehog that'll like make you fire in a certain direction and you know then you have to use these bomb enemies put them in the launchers to explode blocks across the page you know just kind of like a puzzle platformer but I like those type of games so it's fun it looks like there's only about 20 levels though but it's already getting like you're really having to think like even as early as like stage four or five so
1518692	1523256	Alpha Kanatagram wants to say about Mighty Switch Force in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
1538191	1547881	The second screen enhances it, and I use that term very loosely, with the whole radar, which is a neat thing, but it's not necessary to the game.
1548321	1554948	And I'm okay with that, because I don't think the 3DS, or the Wii U... I mean, the same thing, I mean...
1556440	1572397	I don't think the Wii U should whore that second screen too much because you're not physically capable of seeing two screens at once unless it's one of those Nintendo Land games where you hold the thing up to the TV like the little ninja game or things like that.
1572417	1576742	There's some games that are built that way, but most of the gaming experiences aren't built like that.
1577122	1580225	So, I'm okay with the second screen being, like, informational.
1580525	1582186	Glance down here occasionally.
1582587	1585169	A subscreen that you don't have to hit the button to switch to.
1585229	1586790	Like, I think that's an okay use of it.
1587170	1588992	So, hmm.
1589092	1597959	AlphaCanadagram also wants to point out Mighty Flip Champs, which is kind of like a cousin series, also by WayForward, did come out on the PSP.
1598019	1599380	Maybe it was a PS Mini.
1599901	1600001	So...
1601022	1602263	Anyhow, I like the game.
1602483	1603344	It's a $10 game.
1603384	1605806	That's where most of the Wii U downloads seem to be priced is around $10, $15.
1606626	1612371	So yeah, I thought it was... I didn't sit there going, oh, I wasted my money on this experiment.
1612391	1614653	I was like, oh, this game is kind of fun and I would play this again.
1615234	1621739	It would be really awesome if I could beam it to my 3DS and have it on the go, but I know that's asking a lot of Nintendo.
1622940	1625522	Anyway, so that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
1626548	1629810	So before we get into the news, quickly some plugs.
1630431	1633233	Of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1633593	1636675	And you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1636975	1639557	We are on Google Plus as well under Orange Lounge Radio.
1640177	1641658	And I want to plug our mailbag.
1641698	1642719	You can always send us emails.
1642759	1644260	We'll get to those in the second half of the show.
1644660	1646782	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1647122	1650383	and again, please help us support all indie podcasts.
1650483	1663629	I always like to just plug all indie podcasts and the hard people, you know, the hard working people behind, you know, producing these shows and especially the ones on the Voicing Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, especially those shows.
1664349	1666690	Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news.
1667070	1667331	Loki.
1667991	1673474	So, holy crap, Nintendo announces another system, but except it's only for Canadia.
1674454	1675915	I know, it's Canada.
1676815	1677536	Wii Mini.
1678036	1689302	And what Wii Mini is, is a really small version of the Wii that lacks a lot of things, including SD card support, Wi-Fi support, or actually any internet connection support, and...
1692082	1697226	And yeah, it's basically just if you want to play games, and that is it.
1698206	1700248	So games... But it's pretty.
1700308	1700928	That's it.
1700968	1704150	It's pretty small, and I kind of like the way it looks.
1704190	1708353	I mean, it looks like it's got a top loader disk drive to it, and it's red.
1708493	1713076	Well, at least it's black with a red trim on it, and the controllers that come with it are red.
1713757	1717539	It's going to be available December 7th for $99.99.
1717599	1718580	I'm assuming that's Canadian.
1718600	1718700	Yeah.
1719441	1727551	and um oh also not compatible with GameCubeDisc but most Louise nowadays are not either so it's not a big surprise um
1729454	1739476	Yeah, so game system, Red Den Chuck, Red Wiimote Plus, sensor bar, power adapter, and composite cable for $99.99.
1739636	1741896	Pretty cool looking.
1742076	1745197	Lots of people on the... I'm surprised you're speaking as nicely of this as you are.
1745297	1747478	Lots of people on the interwebs don't get it.
1748378	1748878	Why this?
1749078	1751058	You're pushing the Wii U. What the hell is this about?
1751138	1754699	It's why the price point down really low, and I think they figure a lot of people...
1755319	1758140	Let's be honest, I mean, their online was kind of, eh.
1758640	1759440	I mean, it was alright.
1759480	1761361	You can download virtual console games and stuff like that.
1761401	1762741	Well, obviously, you can't do that now.
1763101	1766142	You can't download any DLC or any downloads whatsoever with this.
1766262	1772803	But, I mean, they had that kind of in place where not a lot of people were probably utilizing it.
1772823	1777224	Especially, like, you know, Grandpa and Grandma are probably not downloading virtual console games.
1777885	1779325	They probably don't even know how to do that.
1780946	1787931	So, this is more trying to get into, I guess, those places where people are looking for cheap gaming systems.
1788011	1789712	You know, they haven't jumped into this.
1789792	1793254	And maybe you get hooked on this, you'll buy something else.
1793614	1799558	Although, it's kind of weird to see this coming out so late because there's really not a whole lot of Wii games coming out.
1799658	1808404	Like, you know, if this was something that they were introducing towards the end of the life cycle, not, like, literally at, you know, 1159 of the clock, you know, Wii.
1810546	1834089	it's pretty much done here uh but yeah but there's already a gigantic library out there i mean it's not there's like a lack of wii software yeah that's true but i mean i don't know i would think that they would want to you know try building up their it's kind of like what they did remember with the psp they had like a psp version or whatever with no wi-fi and stuff and it was supposed to be really cheap i just i don't know it's kind of weird that they put that out but
1835448	1836629	It's a little weird, but I get it.
1855330	1859112	You know, oh, I've always wanted Wii Sports, but oh, it's only $99 now.
1859232	1860292	Oh, maybe I'll get it now.
1860852	1864694	Or, you know, a real cheap alternative to having the kids room.
1865034	1872737	And the fact that it doesn't have internet actually is a great selling point for parents who might be trying to control, you know, very heavily what their kids are doing.
1873277	1874058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1890632	1892273	Like, is it a test market thing?
1892293	1893093	I think it's a test market.
1893113	1896614	Because if you think about it, they don't want to mass produce these things and have them not sell.
1897014	1899295	So these are just mass producing them from one market.
1899635	1902816	And then that way, if it's a flop, you're not stuck with millions of these.
1903136	1905557	Or probably not millions, but hundreds of thousands of them.
1906237	1908478	You're only stuck with a few thousand instead.
1909478	1916120	Also something to consider, it's not completely unheard of for Nintendo to do this thing well after the other console has started.
1916220	1923482	I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but those top loader NESs came out right when the Super Nintendos were already coming out.
1924102	1927683	And then I think the Super Nintendo got a remake as well when the 64s came out.
1928803	1943764	I don't remember if the 64's got a remake around GameCube but you still had like the Pokemon 64 and there were some other little remodels that came out relatively late in the life and then GameCube PS2 did the same thing and PS1 yeah right right
1944344	1967642	so I mean well those see even with Sony though that tends to happen kind of like mid-cycle Nintendo's always done it very late so this whole Wii Mini it's not unheard of it's like the DSi XL yeah it's weird that they're taking some of the features away but I guess if they want to get at that bargain basement price and you know maybe they're trying to see they maybe they think somebody who wants internet and their device ought to just get a Wii U yeah
1969677	1972561	Actdeft asks, does the mini come with Wii Sports though?
1972801	1973782	No, it comes with nothing.
1974082	1974703	Interesting.
1975264	1980570	But remember, none of the systems sell with Wii Sports anymore.
1981150	1987017	They actually, well, I mean, they have a bundled one, but they've got it being sold separately now for 20 bucks.
1988298	1992740	How easy though is it to get like a copy of Wii Sports at GameStop for probably like five bucks?
1993040	1993280	Yeah.
1993460	1995841	Or EB Canada or whatever they have up there, you know?
1996661	1998442	So, anyway.
1999582	2003483	Yeah, I mean, obviously it's not something I would pick up anytime soon, but they're nice looking.
2003503	2008845	It's neat, but I kind of want to see someone hack this apart, you know, to add all those features back in.
2008865	2015648	Well, I mean, you know, an SD card slot might be kind of nice, but I mean, if they had an SD card slot, you know, you could buy that and then...
2016488	2018731	What would you use the SD card slot for when there's no internet?
2019351	2023315	You use it for loading the homebrew channel and all the exploits that go along with that.
2023335	2024056	Okay, there you go.
2024997	2031784	All right, VxJasonXV in our chat says, the GameCube wasn't remodeled, but there was the Panasonic Cube.
2032304	2033546	I think that was only in Japan.
2033586	2035127	And again, that wasn't a late cycle thing.
2035147	2036689	That was actually really early on, wasn't it?
2037543	2039544	Yeah, Panasonic Q is pretty early.
2041265	2042546	I always kind of wanted one of those.
2043006	2043466	Not anymore.
2043506	2045327	Expensive for just a DVD player.
2045447	2048509	I remember seeing them in, I think, a Japan town in LA.
2048549	2049089	We would see them.
2049109	2051131	They were like $700 or something crazy like that.
2051691	2052591	So, yeah.
2053412	2054753	I wasn't going to be getting one anytime soon.
2055633	2062757	All right, moving on to a story about something that's been kind of controversial and on a lot of blogs and so forth this week.
2063477	2065759	It is a new Humble Bundle.
2066670	2072432	But this one's got some people raising their eyebrows because it's the Humble THQ Bundle.
2073232	2075913	So it's no longer the Humble Indie Bundle.
2076453	2078574	It's now selling THQ games.
2079354	2081435	However, there's still the charity.
2082155	2086316	You can split the money between THQ charity and the Humble Bundle website tip.
2087056	2088717	You can give all your money to one or the other.
2088937	2091558	You can adjust the sliders just like any of the previous packs.
2092978	2094879	It comes with the soundtracks for all the games as well.
2095319	2097060	Here's the other sticking point for a lot of people.
2097520	2100822	These games are only available on Windows Steam.
2101282	2101863	And in Canada.
2102263	2103724	I'm kidding.
2104044	2104744	Don't start lies.
2105064	2105625	No, no, no.
2105945	2113689	But they're only available on Windows Steam because THQ has imported these games to Linux or things like that, and I guess they don't have plans to.
2115009	2117891	And the Steam part means there is DRM.
2118631	2120993	And the Humble Bundle usually doesn't have DRM.
2121533	2126516	Usually, you can get a Steam key to load the games in Steam, which is what a lot of people do.
2126576	2127197	That's what I do.
2127777	2135182	But you can also, once you've bought a bundle, you have a key that works forever that you can go into the site and just download the game on a whim.
2135822	2140906	If I wanted to, I could go to a friend's house, download the game, install it, and would never know.
2141366	2148830	I mean, with the Humble Bundle being open and pay what you want, you're not supposed to really do that, but if you want to, it's there.
2150371	2160617	But there's a lot of people that are, I don't want to say they're saying that the Humble Bundle is selling out, but I'm looking at a story on the Penny Arcade Report that says it is a step backward.
2162298	2162718	I don't get it.
2164318	2186848	and it's not that like I have some I actually usually really respect in particular the Penny Arcade report and don't mishear me I'm not saying I don't respect him over this story I mean we always are welcome to having difference of opinion this is why we you know have the internet in the first place but I was I kind of had a little bit of a frown at this story because I was like this reads like gamer entitlement in a way to me and I was really disappointed
2187048	2187749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2212225	2216109	They never said, you know, on the site that we're only going to do indie games.
2216189	2218911	They just, this is what they've been offering so far.
2220553	2221614	Don't buy it if you don't like it.
2222134	2224156	Again, this is from the Penny Arcade Report.
2224176	2225557	I'm going to read a little quote here.
2226278	2233865	Quote, Indies have been replaced by a single big name studio, DRM is back, and the variety of platforms supported has been shrunk.
2234305	2236447	This isn't a humble bundle, it's a Steam sale.
2238740	2239761	No, it's not a Steam sale.
2240001	2242442	You can't donate all your money to a Steam sale to charity.
2243183	2244383	That's a huge difference.
2244644	2245904	A huge difference for a lot of people there.
2245924	2247545	You can't also pay what you want on a Steam sale.
2247565	2248066	That's right.
2248146	2251808	You still have to pay some sort of price there on a Steam sale.
2252388	2257691	I get the whole it stinks because they don't support all of the platforms.
2257791	2260093	That's the part I'm kind of with them at.
2260213	2265236	But at the same token, I'm like, well, this is better than nothing at all.
2266115	2269139	and who said the Humble Bundle has to deliver something all the time.
2269619	2273524	I see the Humble Bundle, quite frankly, as gifts to the industry.
2274425	2277148	Pay what you want, donate to charity, lots of great games.
2277489	2280072	That's a freaking gift to the industry.
2281417	2282918	Why are we feeling entitled?
2284018	2284558	That's bad.
2284759	2285619	That's really bad.
2286279	2295323	And it kind of disappointed me that websites like this, that I'm like 99% of the time like, I'm with you, brother, went down this road.
2295403	2297964	Ars Technica, another one that wrote a piece that was very critical of it.
2297984	2299165	And I read that site all the time.
2299465	2300306	I think it's a great site.
2300326	2301346	Sounds good for page hits.
2302046	2302827	I guess that's true.
2304427	2307409	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says, this isn't the EA indie bundle.
2308589	2309470	Ain't that the truth?
2309490	2310230	Yeah.
2310390	2311111	That was a thing.
2311131	2314193	He's making a joke there on something that was real.
2314273	2315154	Very tongue-in-cheek there.
2317136	2327905	I honestly, I think that actually even though it's DRM and only limited platform, as an experiment, it's a good idea.
2328565	2331608	Because, I mean, it's a way for a company to...
2333700	2335803	Basically, all these donations are tax write-offs anyway.
2335843	2341773	Whatever they don't make on whatever the retail price of the game is is going to count as a tax write-off as a charitable donation.
2342655	2346922	But it's a way to encourage people to give to those who need it.
2349185	2361176	The story goes on to make a point about how the bundle will not help the people that actually made the games in this case because a lot of the THQ employees have been laid off since the time this bundle came out.
2361717	2364099	Or, I mean, since the time these games originally came out.
2364820	2367102	And I'm kind of like, alright, I get that.
2367242	2368243	That sucks, but...
2369444	2370585	and DarkSakura.com.
2388823	2417910	or there won't be any THQ games in the future and I kind of I applaud the fact that they're taking a risk and this is a risk around for everybody and I kind of wish more gaming companies would take risks and it seems to be paying off what three million dollars raised not necessarily all for THQ but you figure THQ even if they've got a half million of that is making way more money than they probably were off these games at this point anyway and let's be honest I mean they have Steam sales all the time like you know Saints Row the Third is always being marked down to like
2418810	2420191	10 bucks, 15 bucks, or whatever.
2420631	2422772	That's kind of really what I wanted to buy it anyways.
2422832	2423632	I mean, yeah, cool.
2423873	2425253	Donate money to everything.
2425293	2427714	But yeah, I just wanted Saints Row the Third.
2428255	2430556	Six bucks is a pretty good price for Saints Row the Third.
2430916	2434217	And I get Red Faction Armageddon, which was awesome.
2434958	2436659	And also, you know, Metro 233.
2437899	2438619	And the other games.
2438900	2439720	And Darksiders.
2439880	2443282	I mean, that's just icing on the cake for me.
2443462	2445523	So what?
2445923	2448264	I don't hate the fact that I got a good deal on those games.
2449522	2452663	Then the hate on Steam for having Steam sales then, I guess.
2452964	2455745	I mean, I don't know why people were just hating on it at all.
2456825	2459146	I gave well over the average, actually.
2459186	2463608	I gave a bit over the average to get the pack just because I wanted to support it.
2463729	2466690	I kind of wanted to offset some of the negativity I saw on the internet.
2467090	2469331	And I donated the vast majority of it to charity.
2469411	2471792	I gave THQ a dollar and I gave a dollar for the tip.
2471872	2474233	You know, because you should always give a dollar to something you support.
2474573	2475614	But I gave the rest to charity.
2476127	2477091	I gave it all to charity.
2477452	2479239	I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
2480826	2482746	Also, one more thing I want to read out of this story.
2482786	2486367	And again, I don't mean to be picking on this, but this is just one of those things that I don't get it.
2486687	2492008	Like, I think this guy just had a moment of weakness or something, or I don't know.
2492888	2494088	Again, from the Penny Arcade Report.
2494729	2499649	I'm going to be a hypocrite and buy a bundle, just because these are incredible games at a staggering low price.
2500129	2502710	But wouldn't it have been something if they were offered without DRM?
2503070	2504490	Or if they ran on Linux?
2504870	2508571	Or if the space was used to promote games that hadn't already sold millions of copies?
2509775	2514316	Yeah, that would have been something, but it is what it is.
2514996	2517677	Steam doesn't always put the games I want on sale.
2518677	2522298	Who's to say the Humble Bundle would have been something maybe I would have been interested in?
2522578	2527940	Maybe it would have been another Humble Android Bundle, something I can't get any use out of, you know?
2528780	2529760	It is what it is.
2530680	2532621	You buy some and you leave some on the table.
2534926	2535308	DarkSakura.com
2542170	2544431	and I just don't sign on to that.
2545151	2549252	By the way, this is not the first time that Humble Bundle's done a bundle for one company.
2549532	2552312	There was the Humble Frozen Byte Bundle, which I bought some time ago.
2552972	2554913	Granted, I know, big difference.
2554973	2558774	Frozen Byte's an indie company, very different type of thing, but I just wanted to put that out there.
2559114	2563495	It's not unheard of for the Humble Bundle to do a pack dedicated to one company.
2565635	2566396	I think it's a great deal.
2566616	2569919	And I would encourage our listeners to check it out and support it.
2570219	2580128	HumbleBundle.com One thing we will not do on this show is give away keys that we bought for five cents to the pack of games minus Saints Row the Third.
2581049	2583151	I find that shit to be incredibly tacky.
2583671	2586654	And if you're one of these podcasts that buys keys for...
2587535	2588576	I guess really it's a dollar.
2588616	2590719	I shouldn't say a quarter because you have to give a dollar minimum.
2591159	2598188	But if you're one of these podcasts that buys the keys for a dollar just to get your show some cheap promotion and give them away on your show, I'm calling you out.
2598828	2599729	That's fucked up.
2599870	2601091	You're missing the point.
2601972	2605956	You're denying what potentially could be sales for charity.
2606316	2619328	Now, it's another thing if you gave $20 or $10 or more, you know, and maybe you're including the Saints Row, the third thing, because then, okay, you're fronting that kind of money for somebody who may not have the money.
2619588	2620269	But think about it.
2620649	2639001	if you buy it for a dollar and then give it away on your show to somebody who maybe hadn't heard of it yet who could have potentially spent $20 on the bundle but now won't because you gave them a key that you bought at bargain basement prices you have robbed charity of money for the sake of your own self-promotion don't do that
2641505	2646107	It is different if you buy the whole thing and go, I'm not going to play this crap.
2647628	2649368	No, I'm kidding.
2649588	2654290	Even then, I mean, I've seen... I'm giving them to Dan, the games I'm not going to play.
2654611	2660733	I saw a show doing it out there, and I'm not going to say who, that bought five codes.
2660773	2664435	Well, honestly, I don't know the name of it because it was something I saw while I was Twitter bouncing.
2664695	2665915	So I don't even remember the name of it.
2665935	2668316	But I just kind of, I gave it so much stink eye.
2668396	2669397	I'm like, oh...
2670097	2671421	That's frustrating.
2672022	2673726	Like, stop it.
2676420	2677961	All right, let's see.
2678101	2681023	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2681083	2685566	Brad from PodCulture says, I always donate 100% to charity.
2686087	2690550	I'm usually not a fan of much as the gamers, but they make a great perk for your donation.
2691010	2692371	I think he means kind of like the games.
2694873	2695293	Let's see.
2695613	2701898	Actdeft in chat says, Darksiders is very well worth this bundle, and you can give the Saints Row the third code to anyone you want.
2702418	2703378	DarkSakura
2729417	2735861	Well, how about something having to do with an old idea from Sony coming back to bite them in the ass?
2736821	2737842	Well, at least in theory.
2738762	2747307	In 2008, they had patented a break-apart PS3 controller, and nothing happened with it.
2747427	2751909	And it's also not the huge space boomerang that was there at E3.
2753090	2755251	Well, now they're revisiting the idea with a new...
2756892	2769766	Patent that I mean it even has it down to the circuit boards and everything and two different versions of it with a regular PlayStation controller with little move bobbles on it, which I don't get but okay and then
2773524	2780868	Also, it has regular PlayStation controller handles and then really long ones, like extra grips.
2781388	2783209	I guess if you're doing move stuff with it.
2783229	2786551	So it almost seems to me like they're doing a two-handed move controller.
2787332	2791294	You know, if I was going to design a controller, I'd just make a new NegCon.
2792795	2797637	I do like the idea of there being a controller that kind of snaps apart and becomes the move.
2797677	2798818	That's actually kind of rad.
2799258	2801640	But it looks completely dumb.
2801660	2801740	Yeah.
2803395	2804416	If they build it right.
2804476	2805478	If it was better designed.
2805618	2811445	Yeah, I mean, but Sony is not a stranger to going back and redesigning shit that gets received poorly.
2811846	2814349	Remember the boomerang controller, everybody.
2814469	2816191	At least, that's what I said earlier.
2816231	2817453	It's not the space boomerang.
2817473	2817693	Yeah.
2820376	2824358	What do you think, Loki, about a controller that can break apart and come together and all this?
2824539	2825079	Looks dumb.
2825899	2830102	It looks dumb only because, you know, a lot of people aren't interested in the move.
2830142	2833344	It's not like, oh, we need to sell more of these move controllers.
2834625	2840107	I don't think the thing that's keeping people out of the move is not the price point of their controllers.
2840267	2842168	It's that no one wants to play those games.
2842668	2846210	Which is sad, because it's a good controller.
2846390	2848311	It's actually pretty good.
2849051	2852573	To be honest, I think it works better than the Kinect.
2852853	2859716	That's the tragic thing, is that in a way, the move is really the best motion thing out of all of them.
2859836	2860036	But...
2861135	2862376	Nobody seems to care.
2862676	2862896	Yeah.
2863196	2864997	And there's even some games out there.
2865117	2866297	I can't remember the one.
2866317	2869118	There's some download title that just came out.
2869178	2873880	It's where you're splashing paint with the controllers and like... Unfinished Swan.
2874181	2874501	That's it.
2874561	2875301	Unfinished Swan.
2875821	2877482	And I'm hearing raves about it.
2877502	2879223	I haven't played it myself yet because I don't have a move.
2879243	2882024	Although I hear... I just found out like the other day you can do it with controllers.
2882404	2883365	So I need to check it out.
2883405	2883945	But I'm hearing...
2884705	2912225	Raves about that game and in general the PlayStation Network in general like there's been a lot of great shit on that between Journey which you know is competing for game of the year for a reason in a lot of places and you know the Unfinished Swan and some of these other games like there's so much great shit on PlayStation that like is not getting noticed like Sony has a marketing problem big time and it's part of the reason why the move isn't really selling either.
2912625	2912985	Pura Pura
2932570	2932891	Let's see.
2933571	2937014	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Here's the question.
2937054	2939396	What if you lose half of that break-apart controller?
2939756	2943859	You wouldn't be able to play with it because the half that's the analog stick and the D-pad is missing.
2944200	2947602	Well, if you think about it, what's the Wii U controller in the nunchuck?
2948543	2957210	That was kind of a breakaway controller of sorts, too, and a lot of times that kind of stood in for your typical controller controller.
2957350	2959211	was the nunchuck and the Wii Pad.
2959351	2962112	And if you lost the nunchuck, then stupid you shouldn't have lost it.
2962132	2964173	It was kind of that same thing.
2965993	2972716	Cram in our chatroom says, a boomerang controller would be perfect for all those rage-induced controller throws.
2973636	2974316	That is true.
2974756	2978438	The PlayStation was the first console to get, well, Demon's Souls was the first game.
2981359	2981779	Let's see.
2983039	2984820	SSJ100Matt says, I like the boomerang.
2986266	2988227	Some people liked it, DarkSakura.
2988848	2991289	Well, see how much you like it when it comes around and hits you in the head.
2992210	2994311	I don't think it was an actual boomerang, DarkSakura.
2995091	3001195	I think the buttons cut out some of the... I bet you anything that if they had marketed it that way, then someone would have found a way to make it work.
3002536	3002816	All right.
3003396	3004377	Let's move on with some more news.
3005336	3006838	TimeSplitters
3020576	3031580	So, now, TimeSplitters 4, I mean, that's been in talks for a while, you know, back when Free Radical was doing it, and then it was, you know, supposed to be being worked on by Crytek and stuff.
3032120	3038642	Well, unfortunately, the reason it hasn't kind of come out yet is because they haven't been able to find a publisher yet.
3039603	3040424	To actually put it out.
3041265	3046831	And it kind of sucks because Free Radical's last game, Haze, was kind of crap.
3047952	3052257	And I think TimeSplitters 4 would actually be a really great game.
3052377	3058204	They say that it was in very early stages of development when Free Radical went into administration.
3058804	3086605	and they even had a small playable demo that was shown to several publishers but it didn't attract enough of any publishing deals and they're also saying that the marketing person or actually they're saying secondly the marketing person would say something along the lines of I don't know how to sell this and then the unanimous opinion among all publishers were that they pitched TimeSplitters for
3087745	3092287	or I guess it's a game you can't market because it's too diverse set of characters.
3092747	3097629	Yeah, it is kind of hard to explain a game that features exploding monkeys and cats with wheels on them that you race.
3097989	3101710	But at the same time though, look at Saints Row the 3rd.
3102472	3103172	Perfect example.
3103573	3112797	Granted, that is a little bit more linear, but you've got a thing from this crazy Japanese cat character to hitting people with giant purple cocks.
3113837	3116499	I hit people with giant cocks all the time, just saying.
3116739	3119080	I honestly think the game markets itself.
3119140	3120981	You just show this crazy shit and people are like...
3121221	3123582	Cats with Wheels, fuck yes, sign me up.
3123962	3127062	Or I'm playing a game where I'm shooting people in duck costumes.
3127202	3127762	It's awesome.
3128023	3133844	It's part of the reason we got behind President Cat all those years ago, is it was something different, crazy, and not done.
3133884	3135564	Seriously, just put the game out.
3136184	3143646	By understanding, everyone wants to play it really safe because new IPs kind of don't do well, but
3144369	3145610	Take a risk.
3145670	3147912	You have to take risks to succeed.
3147932	3148793	We just talked about this.
3148813	3149373	Here's how you do it.
3149454	3154518	You put out the HD version of the old PlayStation 2 games, because you've got three of them.
3154538	3157841	You can do an HD trilogy, which people are trying to get a petition going.
3158061	3161724	It actually has a lot of signatures on to get that to happen.
3162745	3171051	Then, based on the response from that, how well that sells, then you go decide, okay, should we move forward with putting this out as TimeSplitters 4?
3171372	3172412	I think it would do well.
3172552	3176235	I think, I mean, if they put out an HD version of these games, I would buy it in a heartbeat.
3176936	3177316	It's easy.
3177356	3179838	I mean, TimeSplitters, seriously, was a great game.
3179878	3189125	It was one of those games that I actually bought one of the, I forget what the hell they called it, but like a multi-tap, but it was basically, you know, maybe it was a multi-tap.
3189865	3192047	The four-player add-on for the PS2.
3192467	3196290	I bought that for TimeSplitters 2, and it was fantastic fun.
3196991	3198652	So, I just hope they do it.
3199312	3200293	Somebody put it out.
3200794	3202695	Or, hey, you know what, Free Radical?
3202755	3205137	I mean, or XFreeRadical, because I think they're gone.
3207979	3216766	I mean, if they have the IP, which I don't know who owns the IP right now, but if they have the IP, there's always Kickstarter, and I guarantee that shit would get Kickstarted no problem.
3219207	3225049	All right, well, speaking of bad management decisions, Sega's been pulling some crazy shit on YouTube.
3225869	3239192	They are shutting down channels, or I should say, excuse me, shutting down the videos, which could lead to a channel shutdown if it happens too many times, of any type of uploaded video of the Sega Saturn RPG Shining Force 3.
3239232	3239432	Now...
3241853	3249559	It's weird because, you know, it's not like Shining Force 3 is this brand... It's not an episode of The Walking Dead that somebody's posting to YouTube.
3249919	3251760	You know, it's something that's years old.
3251860	3253401	So the question is, why now?
3254022	3259866	Well, there is a new PSP installment called Shining Arc that is coming out in Japan in February.
3260607	3269033	Okay, so maybe they don't want people searching YouTube to get confused, but doesn't that seem a little bit throwing the baby out with the bathwater to somebody?
3269053	3269133	Yeah.
3270014	3271456	Here's the other crazy thing.
3272217	3282969	Not only were Let's Play videos thrown out, walkthroughs, random gameplay clips, fans talking about Shining Force were shut down.
3283790	3285732	How is that even possible?
3286733	3288294	Well, okay, here's how it's possible.
3288594	3298517	Because Sega is a YouTube partner, they get the little button that allows them to take down, you know, basically a content thing, no questions asked.
3298837	3302039	The content provider has only 24 hours to repeal it, da-da-da-da-da.
3302379	3306700	You know, NBC has these buttons too and so forth.
3306740	3316224	And this is what led the internet to rage against PIPA and SOPA and all that stuff because it would have given the government one of these buttons.
3316804	3321189	and it would have been open season on not just YouTube.
3321649	3324732	Now granted, YouTube has the right to do whatever they want on their turf.
3325593	3327896	You can't claim this is a freedom of speech thing.
3328356	3335544	There would be nothing stopping you from going to Vimeo or whatever unless Sega decides to crack down there too or whatever other site you want to do.
3336124	3339708	But this just seems like a crappy decision on Sega's part.
3340168	3343131	Especially if this is something to do with Shining Arc.
3344012	3347595	A game that's not even going to come out in the US, or so we think so far.
3348096	3348336	I mean...
3350538	3357702	So you're going to shut down all the fan channels of this niche game from many years ago to promote your new game.
3357802	3358142	Why?
3358502	3362684	You're just going to ruffle the feathers of the people that will most likely be buying your game.
3363284	3366266	Why wouldn't you want some of the publicity out there and so forth?
3367406	3372109	Acidic Vampire wants to know, yeah, OLR, will this be bleeped on the downloaded podcast?
3372410	3376092	No, because this podcast isn't a part of YouTube.
3376553	3377693	It's part of VOG Network.
3377733	3379134	We don't have an agreement with Sega.
3379635	3386600	And that is where the government does allow me to say what I want for the purposes of critique.
3388361	3396247	I wouldn't slander Shining Force or slander Sega or so what, but I'm entitled to my opinion, and my opinion is this is bullshit.
3397532	3399073	I was teasing in the chair room
3419460	3435534	so yeah, Caram in the chat says too now Sega is going to shut down OLR for mentioning Shining Force Shining Force, Shining Force, Shining Force Shining Force, Shining Force oh and how about this, Phantasy Star how about some Phantasy Star, Rob?
3436074	3445723	I would play some music from Shining Force but I can't because all the YouTubes have been shut down do I happen to have any in my collection?
3446183	3447084	I might, you never know
3447751	3450015	And there's also the SoundCloud.
3452078	3452519	Look what I have.
3452559	3453019	Look what I have.
3453580	3454041	Oh, see.
3454061	3454442	Look what I have.
3454982	3455543	Look what I have.
3456425	3456926	Let's play it.
3457046	3457767	All right, everybody.
3457847	3460511	It's the totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
3466783	3467904	Play that over in Mailbag.
3467924	3470545	Play it over in Mailbag.
3470585	3474868	No, because I think technically you're only allowed to use 30 seconds for the purposes of your team.
3474988	3481051	As I found out when doing the intro to another show, it's 10% of the song up to 30 seconds.
3481891	3483852	Well, we'll cut it off at 23 seconds.
3483912	3484373	There you go.
3484953	3486874	So, that song sucked.
3492031	3492511	Just kidding.
3492551	3496573	I don't really think that, but I actually like Shining Force.
3496593	3497953	That's the sad thing about it.
3500694	3503295	Totally illegal edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
3503515	3505816	I have like a bunch of the old Shining Force games.
3506676	3509437	Acidic Vampire in chat says, I'm witnessing illegal behavior.
3509537	3509957	Oh my.
3510777	3513078	Frisbee in chat says, Orange Pirate Radio.
3513959	3514419	There you go.
3514579	3514879	All right.
3516279	3517660	SGO100 Matt says, No, no, no.
3517700	3519240	It's only Shining Force 3, guys.
3519280	3520901	Shining Force 1 and 2 don't count.
3524064	3531783	Anyhow, that was Shining Force Medley by the way Let's move on to more news DarkSakura
3532671	3553875	Well, for anyone who is a fan of The Walking Dead, as we know who was, you know, not listening to Bobby's show and was watching The Walking Dead or reading books, The Walking Dead Assault is going to be on iOS and it will be an isometric strategy game, which, I mean, guarantees I won't be playing it because I hate those kinds of games.
3554435	3556997	However, it's a pretty neat looking game.
3557057	3563000	It mostly looks black and white with a few blue elements and some blood splatter.
3563701	3564721	Oh, there's some green in here.
3564761	3570605	So yeah, it looks like it's mostly black and white with some overlay of various bright colors as effects.
3571145	3573947	I don't know, it looks kind of neat.
3574367	3577709	But it's supposed to be episodic, like the Telltale series.
3579050	3584534	And it's going to follow a new cast, and it's going to be based more on the comic.
3586175	3588216	Quit promoting the competition, jeez.
3589017	3589457	No, I'm just kidding.
3590612	3590792	Get it?
3590812	3592453	Because the show is on right now.
3593054	3594355	I hear the game is very, very good.
3594375	3600619	That's on my list of things I need to finish this holiday season is the Walking Dead games, even though I've never watched the show.
3600659	3604142	But it doesn't matter because the games are based on the books.
3604382	3606023	It's one common misconception people make.
3607744	3608024	All right.
3608685	3612748	Let's move on and travel around the world and look at some games that are coming out very, very soon.
3613468	3619896	Yes, this week we've got Far Cry 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PC.
3621117	3626383	A few games coming out on the Wii, Rise of the Guardians, because it was a little bit delayed from the other launch.
3627003	3631468	Family Party, 30 great games, Obstacle Arcade on the Wii, only for $30.
3633030	3652357	Scribblenlots Unlimited on PC, Rapala's Probe Bass Fishing 2012 on the Wii U, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013 on the Wii U, Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on the Wii U, Guardians of Middle Earth on PlayStation 3, fun little voucher there.
3653877	3657019	I like buying digital games in a package.
3657919	3660160	Resistance Collection on the PS3.
3661520	3663021	And what else here?
3663281	3666802	Oh, the Mass Effect Trilogy on PS3 finally coming out.
3667082	3668203	Already pre-ordered.
3669483	3671024	You are such a consumer whore.
3671124	3672064	You would have done it too.
3672745	3673285	You know what?
3673385	3674865	No, I wouldn't have because I play on PC.
3676006	3676426	Whatever.
3677746	3678107	Also...
3681320	3685805	I hope the PlayStation 3 version has an extra scene with Garrus just to make you mad.
3689610	3691112	And yeah, that's actually it for this week.
3691212	3694876	Almost to the end of games for this year because we only got a couple more weeks before.
3695797	3699001	It's all kind of crap coming out next, but...
3700287	3700667	That's it.
3720339	3747635	Devil May Cry HD Collection, probably because of the new one A new slim console that's Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Emblem Edition Because Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 Yume Kanaishi Mano comes out this week from Sega And that is on the PlayStation 3 And going to the Vita, nothing this week, but Spy Hunter coming out in Japan next week I didn't even know that was still a thing that was going on
3748555	3750056	on the 3DS this week in Japan.
3750116	3751537	Paper Mario Super Seal.
3751717	3754019	I'm hearing good things about that, by the way, here in the States.
3754059	3755700	That's one I haven't looked at, but yeah.
3756561	3759442	Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari 2.
3760743	3761984	Like, what is that?
3762024	3764065	That has nothing to do, like, it's not Pikachu.
3764125	3765046	It's just Pika Pika.
3767508	3768368	I don't know what this is.
3769369	3770229	It's cute.
3770249	3770990	What is she doing?
3771110	3773952	She's like measuring crack on that little scale.
3773972	3774012	Oh.
3775250	3776971	Well, that seems like it's pretty self-explanatory.
3776991	3781052	I think it's a vet hospital game, actually, judging from the pets on the calendars.
3781112	3782372	I think it's like a pet hospital game.
3783132	3783472	Maybe.
3784333	3785673	She's a pet pharmacist.
3786113	3793255	And Slime Morimori Dragon Quest III, Taikai Zoku to Shippodan on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
3793775	3795596	But it doesn't end there.
3795816	3796416	Know why?
3797016	3799737	Because the Wii U launches on December 8th.
3799917	3801598	That is before our next show.
3801618	3802398	Oh, stop it.
3803078	3809202	The Wii U is great, and we'll be launching in Japan, of course, just like they did here with the black version and the white version.
3809222	3819529	There's also a set they're going to be launching over there, the Monster Hunter 3G HD Premium Set, because one of their huge launch games is Monster Hunter 3G HD version.
3819909	3821850	That is a game that is launching with the console over there.
3822030	3830035	Otherwise, other games launching in Japan this week for the Wii U. Assassin's Creed 3, Batman Arkham City Armored Edition, uh...
3831018	3840661	FIFA 13, World Class Soccer, Mass Effect 3 Special Edition, Musou Orochi 2 Hyper, New Super Mario Bros.
3840821	3853225	U, Nintendo Land, Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, and I think that's it.
3853665	3858046	Zombie U, rounding out the launch games over there in Japan.
3860675	3862096	That does it for Japanese release dates.
3862236	3863636	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
3864276	3866517	On the 4th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath.
3866797	3869898	On the 5th, Guardians of Middle-Earth and The Critter Chronicles.
3870218	3871139	That's just a cute name.
3871759	3878641	On the 7th, we have Air Conflict Specific Carriers, Mass Effect Trilogy Edition for PS3, and Paper Mario Sticker Star.
3880382	3880742	The end.
3881682	3882662	The end, Rob!
3883483	3883963	Forever!
3884123	3884503	No, I'm kidding.
3884523	3886044	No, we still have two more shows before that.
3886104	3886444	Damn it.
3886864	3887124	Okay.
3888328	3899492	By the way, speaking of all that hubbaloo and chat about the world ending on the 21st, did you know NASA has an official section on their website dedicated to why that whole thing is a farce and like the world is not easy?
3899732	3907495	But I was reading this fascinating story on Google about how like a lot of us kind of are treating it as a joke at this point.
3907555	3916858	Like, yeah, okay, the world's ending again because we all went through this, what, just six months ago when that wacko out of the East Bay was talking about, you know, May, whatever's Judgment Day, the rapture and all that.
3917698	3940617	But like some people get seriously emotionally disturbed by this stuff and I mean it makes sense especially like younger people really thinking like the world is going to end and they get really like depressed over it and like you know I don't mean to make light of it like it's actually really sad but it makes me just kind of think like oh we shouldn't shouldn't perpetuate that kind of crap because some people really take it like too far like they're just convinced that
3940917	3946802	Even though NASA has come out and said, look, there is no meteor headed towards Earth.
3947182	3949845	If there was, you could see it in the sky by now.
3950305	3954348	It is not like... It's a black meteor.
3954529	3955930	You can't see black on black.
3957031	3963476	Even in Majora's Mask, people, you could see the thing getting bigger as it was coming towards Hyrule.
3963876	3967660	That would be ironic if it was the meteor with the face on it.
3969540	3971642	All right, anyway, let's move on.
3972003	3974646	A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
3974666	3975567	But first, Loki.
3976548	3977449	So this is kind of cool.
3978130	3986580	You know, if you happen to invest in one of the Raspberry Pis, the little pocket-sized computer that's like 35 bucks,
3987961	3988722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4003740	4004461	Pretty awesome.
4004641	4005742	And it's going to be free.
4006202	4008464	So I'm looking forward to that.
4008564	4010005	I actually kind of want to get one of these.
4011306	4015389	They have a huge waiting list, or at least they did have a huge waiting list, you know, to be able to buy one.
4016770	4019932	And I just, at the time, I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with this?
4019972	4024395	But I still kind of want one because it's kind of fun to mess with.
4024455	4026697	It's a $35 computer and now it plays Minecraft, so that's even better.
4029557	4030938	Is Minecraft going to be an Ouya thing?
4031298	4035581	Not to derail too much, but speaking of cheap... Well, here's the thing.
4035641	4050752	Minecraft is already on Android, and granted, Ouya is going to be supporting stuff that's through their marketplace, but I would think that it would be able to run, depending on how they have the buttons mapped for the controllers, if it runs like any of those...
4051372	4052133	Thanks for watching!
4068144	4072707	I would hope that they would have their own version for it, but I don't think it's going to be something you see at launch.
4073548	4082014	I mean, it's going to be something that they'd have to adapt to it or get some sort of... Not just have to see how popular it is and then decide to port it over.
4083055	4095463	But who's to say it might run other games that are not officially supported by OUYA and it just may run.
4096024	4096324	So, hopefully.
4096344	4096604	Hopefully.
4098578	4099759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4121616	4122737	I had one for a while
4142879	4143600	Vectrex Vectrex Vectrex Vectrex
4165595	4192923	it's free so if you want to check it out it does come with Mindstorm for free and you can check it out and I gotta say I was checking it out a little bit before the show and it's a pretty you know for these retro collections they didn't do a shitty job of it you know they you know because sometimes you see these retro collections they're kind of hack jobs like they're not very good but they actually you know put in little achievement systems they have a little cork board in there that you can have your little achievements on and they have the box arts the original one that you can fully rotate and you know look at and
4193183	4194244	They did a pretty good job.
4194324	4195605	So, you know, hey, it's free.
4195705	4196486	Why not check it out?
4196546	4197687	You can play Mindstorm.
4198187	4206073	Now, of course, if you want more, 18 other titles from the Vectrex's collection are available for $6.99.
4207074	4207655	Not a bad deal.
4207975	4209997	That also comes with iCade support.
4210057	4212298	I find that interesting that they're paywalling that.
4212418	4213739	Almost got an iCade.
4213980	4214260	Yeah?
4215001	4215721	But still $100.
4216482	4218143	Like I said earlier, I still kind of want one.
4218523	4219284	I want one too.
4219324	4221125	Even though it is $100, I do still kind of want one.
4221145	4221586	Because I just...
4221986	4223707	Can you imagine me just plopping it there on the table?
4243461	4244642	What is missing from the app?
4244842	4246523	Actual plastic screen covers.
4247123	4249765	Like you had on the... Do you remember you had to take these little screen covers?
4249785	4251246	You know what was missing on my Vectrex?
4251746	4253467	Actual plastic screen covers.
4254047	4255028	Oh yeah, you didn't have those?
4255108	4255308	No.
4255928	4259770	I mean, you can play Mindstorm without one, but... You can play all of them without them.
4259811	4262192	I mean, I'm sure that the games have some sort of overlay.
4262932	4264252	Oh, no, no, yeah.
4264412	4265933	In the app, obviously.
4266273	4269693	How hard is it with modern technology to just draw the plastic on top of it?
4270013	4270894	But it still looked kind of neat.
4270954	4271374	I like that.
4271874	4273254	So check that out.
4273294	4275375	Just search for Vectrex in the App Store.
4275475	4278115	V-E-C-T-R-E-X.
4278595	4283096	A little shout-out for those guys at Rant Media Games who've made that.
4284136	4284456	All right.
4284576	4287717	Hey, what a great lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.
4292608	4297392	DarkSakura is going to dive into the vault so you know it won't be a Vectrex game.
4298193	4302457	But she's going to pick a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should be playing this game.
4302477	4303618	You better recognize.
4304539	4305700	How about you better recognize her?
4307061	4307842	Ooh, is it Tron?
4307862	4308583	Did you pick Tron?
4308623	4309784	No, I didn't.
4310164	4311245	Dan picked the game again.
4311685	4312086	Again?
4312446	4314248	Yeah, but I have a reason for this one too.
4314588	4315870	Alright, what is the classic game of the week?
4315930	4316710	It's Golden Axe.
4317411	4318532	I have not done Golden Axe.
4318592	4318993	Wow.
4319714	4321596	I should have done Shining Force.
4322837	4324599	You really should have, but that's okay.
4324839	4325099	Yeah.
4325340	4327802	Alright, so Golden Axe is the classic game of the week.
4327902	4331166	Oh man, Rob, your contrast is like way crazy on your computer.
4331666	4332227	I'm sorry.
4332267	4333128	We've all had those.
4333228	4333668	Stop the...
4334549	4334929	I know.
4334949	4335590	Stupid ads, that's alright.
4336230	4342412	But Golden Axe is a game that was primarily developed by Makoto Uchida.
4343053	4345954	And it's a side-scrolling hack-and-slash video game.
4346094	4346694	Pow!
4347094	4354618	Done in 1989 for the... Actually, System 16B Arcade Hardware.
4355178	4358999	And of course it came out on the Genesis and Master System much later.
4359019	4359059	Um...
4361500	4364882	It's sort of a Conan the Barbarian type of game.
4365022	4367263	The high fantasy medieval world.
4367323	4371745	And you play as one of three characters who are getting revenge on Death Adder.
4372245	4373106	What a great name.
4373226	4375967	Of course, I always laugh at the later ones because we have Death Adder Jr.
4376607	4377448	That just makes me laugh.
4377848	4378228	DeathAdderJr
4407273	4409033	who tries to use it to kill you to death.
4410154	4413435	There's also a male barbarian, and Rob, this is an even better name.
4414755	4416976	The guy's name is Axe Battler.
4418116	4419576	Yeah, Axe Battler!
4419856	4428879	It just sounds to me like it would be, you know, something from like a redubbed anime that was like, sort of like, you know, Voltron or something.
4429779	4433540	And then you have, he uses a broadsword by the way, and he's trying to
4434080	4434841	DeathAdder is a bastard
4450171	4451432	He's just a dirty bitch.
4452572	4464558	So anyway, they go to rescue everyone from Turtle Village, which actually turns out to be on a turtle, and the turtle takes them across the sea, and then they go to the castle in the back of a giant eagle, and then they beat Death Adder to death.
4465079	4466059	You know, how ironic.
4466419	4470722	And it turns out his daddy, Deathbringer, is the real final boss in the Genesis version.
4471222	4473323	And then they get the golden axe, and they're immortal like forever.
4474605	4479568	So, um, it's, you've got, like, different, um, capabilities with them.
4479608	4495899	For example, the dwarf is strongest on weapon, but weakest on, um, spell power, where the, uh, Amazon is strongest on spell power, but weakest on sword power, and then the, the regular, you know, dude's like, look at my chest, and he's all average.
4497205	4502967	Oh, I love the artwork for this because it looks like seriously something straight off of a D&D cover.
4504448	4516092	But anyway, the producer was super fond of the action movies, especially the Conan ones, so that's why he basically made the game in this theme.
4517012	4519133	And there's all kinds of other versions of it.
4519173	4523135	There was the Mega Drive slash Genesis version that was very faithful to the arcade version.
4523555	4526516	With an extra level of play, you can kill Death Adder's daddy.
4527918	4537337	and we've got the uh this is my favorite part kicking the shit out of those little gnomes that had the potions yeah sorry and then um
4540712	4547538	There was the Sega CD one that was a Sega Classics arcade that had Redbook audio, music, and voiceovers.
4547578	4549719	There was a virtual console version.
4549759	4553382	There was the Sega Smash Pack, the Genesis Collection, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.
4554403	4557446	There's a version on PlayStation Plus for free.
4558446	4566453	There were also PC versions that came out that had a 256-color palette in VGA mode, and it could run it in EGA mode as well.
4566653	4569494	and a CGA and two-color mode.
4569514	4571194	Why would you want to play it in two-color?
4571214	4576175	You haven't lived until you've played Golden Axe and CGA.
4576195	4577916	Which color palette was it?
4578376	4583297	I'm pretty sure it was the CMYK, not the RGB.
4583317	4587058	Which is very funny since monitors are built for RGB.
4587098	4588078	Actually, whoops, I'm sorry.
4588598	4590239	No, the other palette wasn't RGB, it was RGY.
4591843	4595406	Blue was only in the CMYK palette.
4595467	4596668	No, it wasn't even CMYK.
4596968	4598730	God, I can't get it right.
4599030	4601032	CMYK is for print only.
4601112	4605116	No, it was white, not black.
4605556	4608399	Yes, cyan, magenta, white, and black.
4608599	4613704	And then the other one was red, green, yellow, and black.
4613804	4614445	Yeah, that was it.
4614505	4614725	Okay.
4616366	4619448	Thank you for the history lesson, Mr. Loki.
4619909	4628014	The ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64 versions also were rather limited.
4628754	4630776	Like I said, there were different things added.
4630816	4639061	The Master System version retold the story from the perspective of Axe Battler, who was called Tarek in that game, and it's only one player.
4639961	4643704	Golden Axe was also released by Telnet for the PC Engine.
4644584	4648946	and it was like super resampled music, cut scenes, you name it.
4649006	4651708	It's a very, very freaking good version of that game.
4653248	4663733	Sorry for the fact that the music cut out, but I'm trying to find a YouTube clip of Golden Axe CGA because I found a YouTube clip of 39 DOS retro games in CGA.
4664894	4665814	I saw Deanna Jones.
4665894	4667775	I didn't even know they had DuckTales in CGA.
4669376	4670456	Oh God, it was purple.
4670716	4670977	Yeah.
4672257	4674538	Well, I will continue while Rob's looking for that.
4675399	4684884	There was also a handheld TV game of the arcade legend Sega Genesis Volume 1 and an enhanced remake that came out on PS2 as part of the Sega Ages line, which we came close to getting.
4684984	4687565	Was the Skater Die guy supposed to be Rodney Dangerfield?
4687585	4690647	Because I swear to God, I swear to God it's Rodney Dangerfield.
4690867	4691568	No respect.
4691688	4692308	Alright, never mind.
4692928	4696710	Sorry, I didn't mean to derail with another game, but it was an important question that had to be asked.
4696890	4698992	I will give you... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
4699052	4699732	Here's the answer!
4700412	4700873	It is the...
4701753	4704794	It is the red, green, yellow, black palette.
4704874	4705975	There is Golden Axe.
4706135	4707916	It doesn't look too terrible for what it is.
4709276	4711217	Oh, that's not the actual audio.
4711237	4711917	That's just from the video.
4711937	4712878	But there is Golden Axe.
4712898	4715139	That doesn't look that bad.
4715239	4718260	They did some pretty crazy shit with four colors back in the day.
4718280	4720181	You should see strip poker CGA.
4720601	4721521	I have.
4721882	4722722	Of course you have.
4722842	4725583	Well, here's a little factoid with my history with this game.
4726183	4729985	The second game I ever played on a Sega Saturn, Rob, was Golden Axe The Duel.
4731670	4731971	Wow.
4732031	4737121	You know, the first game I played was this crappy Gundam game that came out my friend imported.
4738304	4739707	So, anyway, there you go.
4739767	4740489	Best classic game.
4741130	4741651	Golden Axe.
4742453	4742934	Papow.
4744676	4747477	Sorry, now I'm looking up... Oh my god.
4748737	4749177	Rob.
4749657	4751057	It's strip poker on the Commodore 64.
4751157	4752658	Oh my god, Rob.
4754398	4755978	You need to put that porn away.
4756158	4758319	Some of those strip poker games may have for shareware.
4758339	4762800	Somebody should flag this video for being disgusting.
4762880	4765340	Hey, I see some bush.
4767921	4768601	Oh, the 80s.
4771042	4771942	I don't know why it's so...
4773303	4774885	Oh, I know exactly why it's so funny.
4775165	4777849	Rob, do you find pubes really funny?
4780532	4787760	Well, no, I'm laughing because it just happened to be at the moment I was looking at the video, it said, my hand, as in a poker reference.
4787800	4789903	But then I'm like, her hand looks like it's in her butt.
4792644	4793644	She's getting herself ready.
4793664	4794645	You shouldn't be calling it.
4794785	4797205	In fact, I will actually post that.
4797285	4799785	See, Alpha Cananogram is demanding links.
4800205	4801246	There you go in the chat room.
4801266	4801626	There you go.
4801646	4804106	Since we're on the illegal episode of Orange On Radio.
4804126	4807007	Strip poker in all its Commodore 64 glory.
4807027	4808387	We'll share porn with the kids too.
4812528	4815888	Sorry, I'm also asking Rama to tumble this with a parental advisory.
4816088	4816728	Good lord.
4820329	4820669	All right.
4822540	4823060	There we go.
4824221	4824922	Moving on.
4825202	4829505	That's it for Part A. We need to take a break and clean up our act.
4829906	4832228	This is a very dirty, illegal show tonight.
4833088	4836651	But there's plenty more to come in Part B. We've got more Wii U to talk about.
4836931	4840994	We're going to talk about sales figures over Black Light Friday.
4841395	4842335	Black Friday.
4842876	4850582	And more news on Ouya and some Nintendo rumors when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4857142	4866505	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this December the 2nd of 2012 with the 484th episode of our podcast.
4866525	4868486	We're going to hit 500 early next year.
4868526	4869026	Can you believe it?
4869486	4871947	We need to plan something special, like for real this time.
4872447	4878009	Like even bigger than our 10th anniversary show, which was just like people visiting from far away coming to see the show.
4878309	4881090	We need to plan something huge for our 500th episode.
4881450	4882931	I don't know what, but something.
4884291	4886052	that can be done on a very low budget.
4886992	4889032	We'll have to throw ourselves a party at Chuck E. Cheese.
4890173	4891633	That's about what can fit in the budget.
4892053	4895574	How will THQ bundle theme codes for everyone?
4898295	4900576	Resell keys to the bundle.
4900676	4901516	No, that's terrible.
4901536	4902076	That's awful.
4902256	4903396	How dare you even suggest that?
4904597	4905337	We'll figure something out.
4905437	4907197	OLR Kickstarter for OLRCon.
4907837	4908938	No, I don't know.
4909858	4912839	I guess it would be more appropriate to have the party at Roseville Golf Land.
4913559	4921811	Did you know that the other night, you know, Saturday night was kind of a blood day, but there was a break in the storms and Alan and I were kind of going, what should we do?
4921871	4922852	Should we even go do something?
4922892	4923413	What do you want to do?
4924014	4926598	And it was actually suggested, should we go to Roseville Golf Land?
4927219	4929262	And we were like, what would we do?
4930759	4932080	We'll figure something out.
4952349	4954730	Yep, but no breaks in the near future coming.
4954930	4959092	As far as we know, we're going to keep doing an episode every week on Into 2013.
4959853	4963495	Assuming, of course, the world does not end in a couple weeks, although we all know it won't.
4963615	4963935	Come on.
4964275	4965576	The media needs something to report on.
4965596	4968718	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.
4969338	4969638	All right.
4970239	4974381	So let's talk about something I mentioned during my gaming week, which is...
4975218	4978381	and Skrillex.
4979002	4981504	I swear, that's like a tongue twister for me.
4982344	4984566	It's basically kind of a combination of a bunch of different things.
4986488	4995556	Retro, like NES games, because the whole thing, the premise of it is that there's this piece of dust that falls onto an NES cartridge and...
4996196	4999877	It's what happens when that dust corrupts everything in the game.
5000638	5008100	And so you're kind of playing this Link-type character that's kind of done in this sword and sorcery-type art.
5009260	5015722	And you're fighting glitches that are in the game and trying to save this sort of princess thing.
5016683	5018383	And it's pretty cool.
5019324	5020144	It's a free game.
5020744	5022585	You can check it out on...
5024145	5030333	on their website, which, let's see here, which I don't remember the hell it is, but...
5032492	5032992	It's pretty cool.
5033052	5038756	It's done by, like I said, the guy that did the Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now game, the Perfect Strangers one, Jason Oda.
5038796	5041838	He kind of specializes in adver games.
5042879	5044880	And, yes, so check this out.
5045180	5047962	It's SkrillexQuest.com.
5048862	5050223	It's pretty easy to find that.
5051604	5057588	Another kind of indie game that's getting a really unasked-for sequel is
5060125	5082330	Barclay Shut Up and Jam Gaiden is getting the sequel entitled The Magical Realms of Tyrna Nog Escape from Necron 7 Revenge of Cthulhu and the Official Game of the Movie Chapter 2 of the Hoops Barclay Saga or Barclay 2
5082990	5085051	For short, it's being kickstarted right now.
5085471	5090232	And to be honest, I mean, I remember seeing some of the stuff for Barclay Shut Up and Jam Gaiden.
5090652	5091753	And this looks nothing like it.
5092213	5095033	This just looks like kind of this weird cyberpunk game.
5096494	5099055	And they're looking for $35,000 on Kickstarter.
5099155	5104056	And some of the bonuses include all sorts of weird things, including a Cyberdwarf body pillow.
5104376	5107457	And of course, you know, game downloads, soundtrack, and that kind of stuff.
5109761	5110622	So that's interesting.
5110882	5115525	And then last but not least, Dishonored doing pretty well in retail market.
5115905	5126033	Their sales have exceeded the expectations of Bethesda, so I guess that means we're going to see another series of games or another franchise from Bethesda, which is fine.
5126073	5127954	I think it was a pretty awesome game.
5128254	5155272	apparently it sold 460,000 copies in North America during October and of course the sales figures I think for November obviously haven't been released yet because we just got into December so we'll have to see what it did you know competing up against Assassin's Creed and well actually I guess we saw a little bit of Assassin's Creed sales in there but you know more Assassin's Creed 3 sales and Halo 4 and Black Ops 2 yeah
5158345	5162848	All right, well, moving on to a game I talked about last week, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed.
5175817	5180942	But yeah, some boost pads that are supposed to be there, that are there in the other versions of the game, not there.
5181422	5183184	No wonder I couldn't beat it when I played it.
5183224	5184205	I was like, this is too hard.
5184545	5190270	And I thought maybe I needed to do more drifting to get those boosts, but I guess there really was a bug.
5190831	5194614	So the patch has already been sent to Nintendo for review.
5194995	5196456	So I'm assuming that means it will be out very soon.
5196476	5197657	You just weren't snaking enough.
5197957	5199219	I guess not, which...
5199979	5201560	I don't know if that's something you can do.
5202081	5205283	You can't do it to the level you can do it in Mario Kart, but it's possible.
5206364	5212789	Also, speaking of Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed, there is going to be DLC for the game at some point, especially on 360 and PlayStation 3 versus the game.
5215651	5219695	But folks in the community were throwing out ideas for DLC.
5220335	5225180	And executive producer Steve Lysette with Sumo Digital, who made the game, put out a challenge.
5225280	5240374	Quote, Without any policing from the Sumo or Sega crew, if you can all agree on three characters by the 1st of December and prove there is sufficient interest of at least 1,000 unique people per character, I will present the result to Sega.
5240874	5262749	the fans delivered separate change.org petitions for the following characters for these three current leaders Hatsune Miku Project Diva that's a great choice Ryo Hazuki no from Shenmue no surprise there Segata Sanshiro Segata Sanshiro
5263109	5265854	The Sega Saturn mascot, if you weren't already aware.
5265874	5266615	He's awesome!
5266716	5271103	No guarantees that those three characters will be included, but those are some pretty bitchin' choices.
5271123	5274930	I hope that they do include Ryo, that they include him driving a forklift.
5278775	5281579	I hope when he takes somebody out, he'll be, there's your game of lucky hit.
5282960	5283361	Asshole.
5284743	5288427	Moving on to some other- I want to see, like, Echo the Dolphin or something like that.
5288547	5294355	Something ridiculous that just won't work, you know, or, I don't know.
5296197	5297459	Do they have ToeJam & Earl in there?
5298410	5299031	I don't think so.
5299531	5301512	There's still a lot of great Sega characters they could use.
5301572	5307515	But anyway, moving on to other Nintendo news about the Wii U. In an interview with IGN, Satoru Iwata said, You know what?
5307536	5311898	We're not interested in emulating online services like Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.
5311938	5314620	Here we go again with that whole, we gotta be different.
5314640	5315960	The jokes write themselves.
5316581	5318302	Let me read the quote, then you make the joke.
5319002	5319643	Thank you for watching!
5345697	5346980	Me-verse is something different.
5357211	5360233	It is not done on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.
5360354	5360914	It is different.
5361194	5365317	I think you totally missed the whole underlying statement here that they've totally put forth.
5365758	5368580	They want you to buy one for each member of your family.
5368820	5371362	That's why there's only one gamepad for that console.
5371522	5375025	It's because each member of your family should own one in their own separate rooms.
5375065	5375545	That's right.
5375745	5377126	And they'll connect via the internet.
5377367	5379468	Don't you know that's why the Wii Mini exists?
5379748	5380769	The Canadian Wii Mini?
5380849	5382611	So that every kid's bedroom can have one.
5383211	5383431	Outro Music
5401502	5401922	I'm sorry.
5402943	5403603	That game's terrible.
5405204	5406584	Wasn't there supposed to be a Wii Fit U?
5407464	5407985	Yeah, there is.
5408365	5408805	Where is it?
5409345	5410045	Launch Window.
5410306	5412066	Remember, they still have six more years.
5412166	5413507	Excuse me.
5413667	5414267	Launch Window.
5414567	5416048	Launch Window is such bullshit.
5416108	5418369	Launch Window should be that week that's coming out.
5418409	5422010	You know, if it launches on Sunday, hey, I understand that all games are not going to stream on Sunday.
5422030	5422411	Like a month.
5423331	5425752	From launch to Christmas would have been Launch Window to me.
5426556	5431221	Launch a window is not fucking your fiscal year that the launch happens to take place in.
5431681	5432102	That's like...
5433393	5438077	That's like calling a hole blown into your wall that's the entire side of your house.
5438117	5442240	That's the launch window for investors only, the people that Nintendo's really trying to speak to.
5442300	5445663	That's like calling the wall missing in a dollhouse a window.
5446484	5450547	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Me-verse is very unique.
5450667	5453870	I think it's cool people can write and stuff directly from the gamepad.
5454230	5456592	However, if I had it, I wouldn't be able to draw on it.
5456712	5458994	I can't draw Jack's shit, only stick figures.
5459514	5468340	Yeah, I gotta admit, the whole Miiverse thing, as much as I do love it, I think it's great, and the community element and so forth, it really reminds me how bad of a drawer I am.
5468720	5474004	I tried to draw one for one of the levels I beat in Mario, and it's just, it's not, it's not good.
5475205	5481048	I'm not a good artist at all, and the Wii U makes me feel insignificant.
5482569	5488313	You know, I think this is gonna be very popular until it goes away, a PictoChat where everyone's just kinda like,
5490396	5490677	I'm over it.
5490697	5493845	I can't believe internet PictoChat's not a thing, but I guess Nintendo can't police that.
5493865	5495529	That would be awesome.
5495549	5496391	Penises everywhere.
5496411	5497333	Think about the children.
5499320	5504804	One of the places Nintendo was getting slammed with the launch of the Wii U console was that you can't really move your Nintendo Network account.
5505224	5511808	Well, some clarity's come forth this week through somebody who sent their bricked Wii U system into Nintendo.
5512168	5519332	Nintendo, in turn, sent them back a brand new console that was allowing them to sign in to their previously made Nintendo Network account.
5519692	5520573	So there's the answer.
5520613	5524935	If you want to move your Nintendo ID from one console to another, just send it into Nintendo.
5524955	5525756	They'll do it for you.
5526096	5527017	That's cost-effective.
5527917	5553708	I'm assuming, especially if they launch Wii U's That's the way they did it with the Wii When they launch Wii U's in other colors and other shapes and all this other stuff There'll be a way to do it in the future There'll be a move me channel or something It's just stupid It is a little ridiculous It's just like, hey, features that are helpful, eh, fuck that, we're different We don't want to emulate the guys that actually have functioning online services We're just gonna, we're gonna wing it
5554255	5555316	It's our, we're going to wing it.
5555556	5559038	We're going to try to create something that's more like, you know, social and stuff.
5559498	5560318	Oh, patches.
5560678	5564861	Well, uh, uh, online connectivity.
5565441	5569003	Uh, well, yeah, I don't know.
5572423	5576325	Alright, Bobby in our chatroom, Bobby Blackwolf says, I drew something that said I couldn't draw.
5576486	5577506	I got yaz for it.
5577566	5582469	My stick figure flipped a table and a stick kitty told me to please be reasonable with the table.
5583270	5584250	I haven't seen that drawing yet.
5584290	5585351	I need to log on to Miiverse.
5586472	5587793	Alright, let's move on.
5587813	5588233	DarkSakura.
5591248	5591748	Uh, hold on.
5591868	5592469	Okay, there we go.
5593329	5594689	Well, uh... Hold on to what?
5595050	5595370	Shush.
5595830	5596810	The new Super Mario Bros.
5597110	5598351	2 is getting Super Mario Bros.
5598391	5599211	and Super Mario Bros.
5599571	5601712	3 levels and they are available now.
5602312	5607374	They're through, uh, looks like free Coin Rush content and is now available to download.
5607954	5609575	So that's good for people who have that.
5610655	5611795	Yay for DLC, right?
5611895	5612556	After that's gonna be $2.50.
5614517	5636277	Then for the Vita, there is going to be a PlayStation Plus bundle So it's going to be $300 And it will have the PlayStation Plus Instant Game Collection And it will be a Black 3G Wi-Fi Vita, a year of Plus And a voucher for download of Unit 13 and a 4GB memory card
5638206	5642368	and last but not least, Stern is bringing out Avengers Pinball.
5642528	5643188	Yay!
5643888	5648730	Which, I mean, we all saw that coming anyway because Stern is basically the only releaser of pinball games now.
5649290	5652311	But hey, it will hopefully be a good table.
5652912	5653812	I'll keep my fingers crossed.
5656193	5658634	Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
5666769	5668550	Facebook plus Google.
5668690	5670812	Slam them together and you get Google.
5671292	5674494	And we ask a question on our social network communities every week.
5675114	5676475	This week is the following.
5677176	5679377	What is on your gamer's Christmas list?
5679797	5681819	Or Hanukkah, Festivus, whatever it is you observe.
5682599	5683299	So, that's it.
5683480	5685161	Pretty simple question with the holidays coming up.
5685201	5691785	We want to know what people are asking for from Santa Claus and Hanukkah Harry and their Festivus pole and the moon or whatever it is.
5692285	5694948	So, starting off with some of the answers from Facebook.
5695048	5696270	We have a lot of answers tonight.
5696310	5697291	I can't read them all.
5697431	5701275	I'm going to read some of the names I don't usually see in chat.
5701375	5707923	DarkCharger says, While I wasn't quite willing to pull the trigger myself, I wouldn't mind if Santa put a Wii U under the tree.
5709844	5724292	I'm not gonna buy a Wii U James S replied and said I have my eye on PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale but other than that I believe next year will be exponentially better possibly even new consoles from Sony and Microsoft
5725553	5733919	You know, we didn't get into it in tonight's news, and we're not going to, but the Microsoft rumors were taken off again about the new console.
5733939	5737322	Like, it even showed up on my Google News feed.
5737382	5745468	Just more rumors about Microsoft launching in holiday 2013, and I always kind of thought that was a given.
5746428	5748470	It's just someone else saying the same thing again.
5748490	5749951	Investors picking up on it.
5750391	5755796	Oh, we think they're gonna, we're an analyst and we think that they're gonna launch a new console, you know, next year.
5756677	5757157	Cool.
5757398	5759399	You know, if I say that, no one fucking cares.
5759579	5762682	Here's the part that surprised me about that story.
5762722	5767386	The part that was news and interesting is that they may not unveil it at E3.
5767907	5771490	They may do their own event, which, it makes sense.
5771650	5771970	Why not?
5772771	5773531	They can get away with it.
5773992	5774712	Nintendo does it.
5775452	5778393	I mean, they do E3, but instead of Tokyo Game Show, they do their own thing.
5778473	5779934	Why shouldn't Microsoft do their own thing?
5781354	5783195	I actually think that's a great idea.
5783835	5792138	Actually, as long as it's before E3, because unveil the console before E3 and then make E3 about what, everybody?
5792378	5792619	What?
5792719	5792979	What?
5793379	5793999	The games.
5794179	5794959	Xbox Live.
5795019	5795120	No.
5796901	5797842	Halo 5?
5798063	5798864	I would love that.
5799124	5801427	I would love it if E3 could actually be about the game.
5803130	5803410	Alright.
5804512	5807376	Oop, I guess the music was too loud in that previous segment.
5807416	5809740	Sorry, I thought it was at its usual volume.
5810020	5810340	My bad.
5811342	5812303	Live radio, it's fun.
5813144	5813904	I heard myself.
5814024	5815405	All right.
5815505	5815925	Let's see.
5817665	5823967	Burr replied and said, I'm terrible and that I've already bought everything I wanted for myself, like a Wii U and whatnot.
5824388	5829029	I would love a Steam sale on Borderlands 2 DLC or Mass Effect 3 DLC, however.
5829758	5835520	Yeah, I mean, that's the thing about growing up is that you kind of end up buying yourself all the stuff you want.
5835560	5838621	Like, I bought myself a Wii U. That was kind of my early Christmas present to myself.
5838641	5840502	I'm not really expecting anything else from anyone.
5840982	5842502	You know, I wanted it.
5842542	5842983	I bought it.
5843483	5844223	Happy holidays.
5846844	5850665	Degenerate Johnny said, To be honest, I've been pretty disappointed with this fall's lineup of games.
5851025	5858288	Therefore, my holiday list will consist of paid-off pre-orders of next year's games, such as Dead Space 3 as well as Bioshock Infinite.
5859448	5864670	Tiara from geek-life.com said, I need the new Skyrim DLC, Dragonborn.
5865010	5867431	No, really, I need it for reasons.
5869432	5869933	Let's see.
5871073	5878956	Critical Myth replied and said, Assassin's Creed 3, PlayStation Vita with Assassin's Creed Liberation, and a couple of memory cards, Mass Effect Trilogy.
5878996	5880117	Those are the big ticket items.
5880857	5884919	And Dave Falcon said, Assassin's Creed 3 for my fiance for Hanukkah.
5885979	5887461	Well, that's what you bought somebody else.
5887541	5890143	We wouldn't know what you wanted under your tree, but I guess that works.
5891925	5892305	Let's see.
5892405	5896029	Moving on to our Google Plus community.
5898516	5900538	Just a few comments here, so I'll read these.
5901279	5904943	Actdeft says, I want an HDTV to play games in HD.
5905163	5907405	I'm still rocking a 15-inch SDTV.
5908166	5911129	A 3DS, since it's turning out to be a solid console now.
5912630	5914092	Forza Horizon Season Pass.
5914492	5915934	King of Fighters 13 for 360.
5917195	5919237	It's free on PlayStation Plus, just saying.
5919702	5921843	Although I guess PlayStation Plus isn't free, but whatever.
5922584	5927307	Zone to the Ender's HD, everything on my Steam wish list, RAM for my PC.
5927987	5929948	You have a big list, Actdeft.
5931429	5932550	Oh well, lots of options, right?
5933210	5935071	Monster B wants the following for Christmas.
5935191	5940775	A PlayStation 3 controller charging station and a Steam gift card to help support my addiction in 2013.
5940855	5943336	What are you talking about 2013?
5943376	5945137	That winter sale will still be going on in 2012.
5947887	5959473	And lastly, AJ Twist replied and said, King of Fighters 13 on PlayStation 3, a PlayStation 3 arcade stick, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 4, Turtles in Time on the Super Nintendo.
5960354	5960974	Good pick.
5961995	5962415	Good pick.
5962655	5962895	All right.
5963416	5964956	That does it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
5965937	5967938	DarkSakura, do you have any holiday gaming wishes?
5969059	5969419	Garrus.
5970379	5970659	Oh, yes.
5970800	5971040	Oh, yes.
5971080	5972220	You even replied on Facebook.
5972240	5973501	You want your Garrus figure, right?
5973621	5973821	Yep.
5974502	5975002	Where's that from?
5976181	5981610	Play Arts Did you see the Mass Effect museum style artwork that they were selling?
5981710	5984174	I didn't see very big pictures of it, but it's okay.
5984274	5984875	It looked nice.
5985636	5986217	Me wanty.
5987619	5989061	Loki, anything on your holiday list?
5989442	5990383	I really pretty much...
5991585	5999488	I bought the last console game I'm going to get.
5999508	6004309	A year to PlayStation Plus would be kind of cool because I don't really want to pay for that.
6004570	6006750	I don't even know if I would really use that.
6008631	6017294	Maybe Raspberry Pi, but trying to explain that to anybody would be difficult for them to understand what the hell I was talking about.
6017514	6018134	You want pie?
6018194	6018954	I thought you didn't like pie.
6018974	6019215	Um...
6022719	6024120	Yeah, that'd pretty much be it.
6025041	6032547	I was going to say, it's funny, our family, we kind of draw names, you know, just get gifts for one person except for, you know, Josh gets gifts for everybody.
6034088	6036209	My wife, she's like, oh, I hope I get your name.
6036830	6041213	She's all, you know, instead of, you know, your mom or something like that because I don't know what to get them.
6041674	6044176	And so she got my name and she's like, I'm not getting you anything.
6046457	6046858	Like, thanks.
6046878	6047818	Nice, nice.
6047858	6048399	Happy holidays.
6048799	6050721	Well, maybe it'll be a surprise if she does get you something.
6051880	6052481	Don't hold your breath.
6052661	6053663	No, I'm not holding my breath.
6055946	6065599	Again, I pretty much bought everything I wanted, but I wouldn't mind if I got an iCade or even one of these things I don't think I would ever buy myself, but if it showed up, I'd be kind of happy.
6065619	6067522	It would be one of those Atari flashback consoles.
6067862	6068762	I like retro shit.
6068882	6070403	I don't even think they sell those anymore.
6070563	6071504	They do at Toys R Us.
6071524	6072484	I saw one the other day.
6072724	6074965	I figured they'd have old ass inventory.
6075045	6077746	They're like the three, the flashback threes or whatever the newest ones are.
6079427	6080247	I like retro shit.
6080747	6081308	It amuses me.
6081768	6086210	Or a Ben Heck Xbox 360 laptop would be fucking awesome.
6086510	6088250	I want a working Commodore 64.
6090112	6093656	to hook up to my TV, which I don't even think you could do without some major converters.
6093716	6095078	But damn it, I would try it.
6096059	6096640	Oh, man.
6097201	6098883	Well, don't they have like an RF adapter?
6099083	6102948	Yeah, well... They have the... Well, it's UHF, right?
6103269	6105752	Yeah, there was... Well, they have the UHF to RF.
6105792	6106553	They used to have this.
6106753	6112517	You could hook up a Commodore 64 through RF adapter or something that was very similar to RCA plugs.
6113058	6116841	Except for one video and two audio, there was two video and one audio.
6116901	6121524	So they didn't cross work, but you could probably get a converter for those too.
6121564	6125727	I think the Commodore 64 monitors were RGB, like arcade monitors.
6125948	6131212	So I have a converter board for that to play arcade games on your TV.
6132359	6137202	Alpha Cananogram in our chatroom says, Rob, it's an Atari Flashback 4 with wireless controls now.
6137302	6137942	Oh, I had no idea.
6138383	6138803	There you go.
6138883	6139363	I want one.
6140324	6140884	Gimme, gimme.
6140944	6141685	I want it all.
6142505	6144086	Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.
6144766	6154132	So, you know, Zynga and Facebook have been pretty chummy for a while now, but now they're trying to read, you know, set out new terms as far as their partnership goes.
6154572	6160776	Basically, what's going to happen is they're going to have some opportunities to have Facebook to have kind of official Facebook games and
6161496	6190163	and also it'll also kind of tie in with Zynga will still I guess use Facebook's payment system but they're gonna kind of try to I guess we'll find a way to separate a little bit they're gonna allow it's gonna allow each of the parties like Zynga to promote game their own games that they create and also I guess before they were required to use I guess Facebook's monetization platform
6190803	6196265	and now Facebook could make their own games to compete with FarmVille and stuff.
6198625	6206467	Unfortunately, the way I see this is there's so many FarmVille and those types of game clones.
6206627	6211889	I think Facebook came out with the official Facebook farming game.
6211929	6213209	I don't think anyone would give a shit.
6213349	6217370	I think it would be just like if EA came out with a farming game.
6217710	6219011	No one would care.
6219911	6222152	Insert my typical Facebook rant here.
6222432	6223993	I'm just... I'm so over Facebook.
6224433	6229034	You know, I was talking to somebody on my Facebook tonight about why I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook.
6229054	6231915	And there was even a post I saw on Twitter that kind of talked about this.
6231995	6238718	And I really do like... I just... I... Right now, as of late, I enjoy Twitter more than Facebook because...
6239938	6242599	Even though there are offensive things on Twitter, don't get me wrong.
6242659	6253722	Like, people tend to offend a lot less on Twitter, and I think it's, like, the character restriction kind of is, you know, tighter there, so you have to really think before you post.
6254142	6259143	And, like, people aren't as forthright to just spew stuff all over, and I don't know.
6259324	6259704	It's great.
6260224	6260844	I loves Twitter.
6262165	6265206	It's not perfect, and there's no games.
6265647	6266067	No games.
6266107	6267428	The only thing that shows up in my feed?
6267488	6268308	Promoted posts.
6269169	6270809	And luckily, they're pretty easy to scroll past.
6270890	6271930	Those are also on Facebook.
6272871	6273211	Oh, yeah.
6273591	6277633	In fact, the Fugle Question of the Week, I posted it tonight, and Facebook brings up this little pop-up.
6277953	6279554	Would you like to promote this post for only $5?
6280815	6283777	Which made me think, oh, nobody's going to see the Fugle Question of the Week this week.
6284097	6285318	Which reminds me, listeners...
6286118	6287219	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6307418	6307698	DarkSakura.com
6337094	6338175	BlackWolf says, really?
6338235	6339677	There's Twitter drama every week.
6340578	6343721	Yeah, but in a Michael Jackson eating popcorn gif kind of way.
6343761	6347344	The good news is it usually doesn't involve me or my friends, so I'm okay with it.
6347965	6350648	Twitter drama is when celebrities say shit, you know.
6352349	6352650	Anyway.
6354608	6355209	Moving on.
6355529	6357452	I don't want to talk all about social networking.
6358314	6359335	Everybody knows where they stand.
6360177	6364924	Sales figures coming in from the launch weekend of the Wii U. Excuse me, launch week.
6364944	6367027	400,000 Wii U's sold in the first week.
6370276	6376620	Over that same period, Nintendo sold 300,000 Wii consoles and 500,000 portable devices.
6376640	6380243	That's 1.2 million units sold in the U.S.
6381643	6399075	Also, it should be noted that the Xbox and PlayStation sales figures came in, and I apologize, I don't have it in front of me, but it was around $700,000, $750,000 for the Xboxes, and I want to say Sony was $700,000 when you combined both the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
6399475	6404217	Which led a lot of people to say, OMG, Wii U's dead already.
6404718	6405498	Wii U's dead already.
6405798	6410781	Xbox 360, a six-year-old console, is outselling the Wii U. Wait a minute.
6411441	6413362	What is the internet forgetting, Loki?
6413942	6416563	They're forgetting that that's all that was available.
6416743	6417544	It sold out.
6417764	6421426	It's just they only made that many consoles available at the time.
6422066	6423967	You also have to figure if they sold any more of that.
6424928	6427689	Well, actually, the first week would have included Black Friday, I would assume.
6428209	6431491	So, you know, there's that kind of thrown there.
6431511	6433752	A lot of people are holding back their consoles until Black Friday.
6433772	6436293	But yes, there's not like Wii U sitting on the shelves.
6436574	6439195	Trust me, they're nowhere to be, you know, at all.
6439355	6442357	and how did the Xbox 360 sell in its first week?
6442818	6446861	I mean those things were fucking diamonds to find when they originally came out.
6446881	6449323	Remember the Xbox 360 launch and how shitty it was?
6449843	6457529	Like those things were really hard to find so I would bet their sales numbers were not so hot and a lot of that was because of supply and demand as well.
6457649	6457850	Yeah.
6458270	6460732	So I think it's comparing apples to oranges a little bit.
6460752	6461012	Well and also
6461072	6466613	And also, that's a little bit different, too, because, you know, you're talking about a real generation jump there.
6466673	6471414	It's the first next-gen console, whereas the Wii U is kind of like, it's not really a next-gen console.
6471434	6476256	I mean, the graphics aren't like, oh my god, this is like way different than what I'm seeing on the other consoles.
6476316	6478156	It's just... It's Nintendo doing its thing.
6478316	6478496	Yeah.
6479996	6482397	So it's not, it doesn't have the same impact, I guess.
6484628	6485389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6507205	6508306	They are still showing up.
6508346	6513468	Speaking of Twitter, haha, I just saw a picture of a bunch of them sitting at a Best Buy that somebody took a picture of.
6513548	6515550	So, I mean, they are being replenished out there.
6515690	6519171	So don't think you won't have one for the holidays if you don't want one.
6520112	6520832	You can still find them.
6522433	6524554	even if GameStop got rid of their call list.
6524574	6526455	Don't go to GameStop.
6526475	6529396	Seriously, because I remember it was when I got the PSP.
6529456	6531737	I don't know if you were with me or not.
6531757	6533878	I don't think you were.
6534258	6542962	But no, it was when I got the PSP, I went to GameStop, and they're like, oh, good luck finding one of those.
6542982	6544323	You'll never find a PSP.
6544483	6546844	Went to Best Buy, they had a whole case of them sitting in there.
6547424	6572454	so yeah I hate the attitude of a lot of people I've seen working there but if you didn't pre-order you're never gonna get that yeah yeah no that's try me bitch or the games I'm not gonna get them on release day if I don't pre-order amazon.com pwned like like be aware of what you're really competing with people anywhere else moving on Dark Sakura
6573337	6574979	Well, we can move on to other news.
6575500	6578062	How about Steam's Greenlight?
6578122	6579924	There's a third batch of games being accepted.
6581586	6583428	I actually looked a little bit at Primordia.
6583508	6585130	The other one is Walking Mars.
6585671	6594521	But Primordia is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi game that Valve actually rejected after several indie titles were pulled in.
6595089	6599390	And then the other one was Walking Mars done by TigerStyle.
6599770	6605191	It was an OS game and it made App of the Day back for Eurogamer.
6605731	6606652	Don't know if anyone remembers that.
6607092	6609092	I think I'm the only one here that follows Eurogamer.
6611993	6613493	I read a review of theirs today.
6613553	6616774	I couldn't understand why it didn't jive up with what the rest of the internet was saying, but...
6617108	6617809	Loki?
6617849	6618189	Loki?
6639474	6642097	So the Ouya is making progress.
6642217	6648262	They announced that they're going to be able to start shipping consoles December 28th.
6648583	6659173	Now, it's not necessarily consoles to users, but those are development kits that are going to be going out for any developers that want to start making games for it.
6659253	6660494	And basically, you know, if you have
6661314	6667397	I forget how much money you have to donate or contribute for Kickstarter in order to get one of those.
6668498	6669538	It was a few hundred dollars.
6669679	6672020	But those people are going to be getting their consoles soon.
6672720	6675842	And it sounds like everything is going as planned.
6675942	6677823	And man, that thing is tiny.
6678823	6679704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6703036	6703977	That stuff later on.
6704277	6711044	I think I want to say that every console is going to be coming with a dev kit or like some sort of way where you can make your own.
6711064	6716269	If they're so open, I don't see why they wouldn't all function as dev kits in a way.
6716429	6716989	I think they will.
6717070	6718891	It's just these consoles are a little bit earlier.
6719372	6721694	But yeah, it's going to be interesting.
6722154	6723195	So it's really happening.
6723416	6724076	It's really happening.
6725097	6725577	Thanks for watching!
6749160	6757023	I wouldn't be surprised if it's delayed past March because a lot of the Kickstarters that I've been contributing to, not a lot of them have been on time.
6757143	6767626	Like, hell, the stuff I got from Freddie Wong and the whole VJHS stuff arrived just a couple weeks ago versus the targeted date was, like, March.
6768167	6769967	I mean, so that's a long delay.
6770107	6774389	But, I mean, I have a little trust that they're going to actually deliver on stuff.
6775009	6777850	It's just, you know, not exactly in the timetable that they were talking about.
6781146	6783310	BlackWolf in our chat says, I'll believe it when I see it.
6783510	6784752	It still has a chance to fail.
6784812	6786394	The Mayans predicted its failure.
6787476	6787937	True point.
6790300	6795122	Some of the Kickstarters I've backed, I've only backed two, but GamerCon, I mean, that has to happen on the weekend.
6795142	6795943	They say it's going to happen.
6795963	6800485	I know they booked the venue, and it's moving forward, so I don't see how that's not going to happen when they say it does.
6800525	6801305	That should be exciting.
6801685	6806667	And then the Shadowgate reboot was the other thing I Kickstarted, so I'm excited to see what comes of that.
6807567	6809048	They send updates all the time.
6809088	6810028	I had to stop reading them.
6810048	6811569	They send too many damn updates.
6812149	6813030	They were up to, like, update 29.
6814691	6815672	I think it's more than that.
6815692	6816494	The Shadowgate one.
6816514	6817375	Did you back that too?
6818697	6819338	Yeah, I did.
6819398	6821020	I backed the first one.
6821180	6828431	It was... I don't even remember what updates they have now, but I get updates from a lot of these.
6828771	6829472	I've got like...
6830774	6831314	Thanks for watching!
6847402	6875372	I like there's one I did I draw comics sketchbook and reference guide because it looked awesome there you go moving on to another news and rumor type of thing Yoshi's Land rumored for the Wii U and now Best Buy and Future Shop are apparently taking pre-orders for it this is after the whole Miiverse hack that's not really a hack but everybody called it that where the guy found the page the mock-up that Nintendo pulled and put the statement out on and
6876173	6881578	Apparently, Best Buy even has a little description of the game for Yoshi's Land.
6881638	6889126	Quote, Take Yoshi on an epic adventure to remember in Yoshi Land for Nintendo Wii U. Check out Yoshi as you've never seen him before in glorious high definition.
6889467	6895994	Enjoy dual screen control thanks to the Wii U touchscreen gamepad where you'll also be able to experience full integration with Nintendo's Miiverse service.
6896394	6896594	Well...
6897555	6903301	That's a whole lot of nothing because anybody could guess that on the title alone, but it's interesting that that exists.
6905242	6907725	I'll give you some tinfoil hatness here if you want.
6908986	6915532	I believe Reggie has teased a couple times that maybe we don't really know everything that's going to be in the launch window.
6915912	6917254	Maybe there's something else.
6918115	6919396	This could be that something else.
6920095	6931343	And, speaking of Twitter and promoted posts, one of the posts that fell on my feed earlier this evening was from Spike TV saying, Hey gamers, don't forget to watch the Spike Video Game Awards.
6931804	6935286	More first party exclusive reveals or whatever.
6935326	6937388	More big game reveals.
6939062	6952169	we saw Miyamoto come out on stage at the last Spike TV Awards to great reception maybe maybe tinfoil hat Yoshi's Land to be revealed at Spike Gamer Awards discuss
6953405	6956567	I think it's just a bunch of bullshit.
6956667	6957387	Let's be honest here.
6957587	6958548	Of course you do!
6959088	6959889	Let's be honest.
6960029	6971435	GameStop was taking pre-orders for Pilotwings for the Wii and Mario Paint.
6972256	6974597	I think they had Mario Paint for the Wii U and stuff.
6974857	6982142	There's a whole bunch of TBA stuff that someone gets an idea that there might be something coming out and then they'll put a pre-order for it because guess what?
6982842	6985368	That's giving them your money.
6986817	6989419	They're taking a pre-order for a game, and if it doesn't come out, hey, guess what?
6989699	6994542	We've got this credit that you paid for this game, and now you can apply this to another game.
6994742	7003487	It's why companies love gift cards, because there's so many people that never spend them or just have remaining balances on them that they throw the card away.
7003928	7005469	Oh, it's just a 50-cent balance.
7005489	7006249	Just throw it away.
7006730	7008531	Well, the company just made 50 cents off you.
7009231	7009511	Yeah.
7009631	7013254	And if that happens a thousand times, it starts to become a little bit of money.
7015697	7022614	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase Jellyfish.
7024339	7030344	Tiger Claw has a thought that maybe the Spike VGAs will reveal Bungie's new game, which recently had leaked concept art.
7030624	7032025	That's another great thought, actually.
7032286	7037290	They've already said which games are getting reveals, or at least some of them.
7039011	7044235	Like The Last of Us, and I don't think it's necessarily a reveal, but like a new gameplay thing.
7045136	7048439	I'm trying to remember what else was on there.
7048459	7049880	I think maybe Fuse?
7051261	7051561	I don't know.
7054266	7057650	I watched the little trailer that they had with Samuel L. Jackson as a baby.
7058050	7059231	That was weird.
7060052	7061213	I didn't watch any of it.
7062174	7066799	I'm just going to wait until five minutes after the show's over and then everything shows up on YouTube.
7066999	7067520	That's all I need.
7068481	7069622	I just want the YouTubes of the reveals.
7069962	7072084	Kind of like the year that Skyrim was announced.
7072104	7072685	YouTube.
7072705	7073005	YouTube.
7074983	7077104	Do you think maybe a new Batman game will be announced?
7077324	7078785	God, I hope not.
7079025	7080105	What are you talking about?
7080165	7080906	Bite your tongue.
7081046	7082647	Arkham City was amazing.
7083787	7084988	You know where you can put that thumb.
7085388	7087249	Alright, let's move on.
7087769	7088729	Loki gave me a thumbs down.
7090910	7092171	You really hate Arkham City?
7092191	7093171	I don't hate it.
7093211	7093772	I've never played it.
7094072	7094692	You don't know shit!
7094752	7097593	I don't want to see another Batman game.
7097814	7098634	I think it's stupid.
7099611	7100191	Oh my god.
7100372	7101492	Oh, this conversation.
7101572	7102433	I can't talk to you.
7102613	7105454	Why would you have another Batman game when they just released one last year?
7106495	7107135	I mean, seriously.
7107155	7109297	Batman Arkham State!
7109697	7111638	Oh, the whole state is a prison now!
7111938	7113219	Arkham?
7113459	7119903	I think they had joked they were going to call it Arkham World, but that didn't actually mean... Hey, hey, I have an idea.
7119943	7120283	Let's...
7120603	7140078	Let's get Snake Plistin in here, he'll fucking escape from New York Oh wait, but it's gonna be Batman instead But hey, whatever, we'll just rip it off, it'll be fun It doesn't actually mean world, dummy We're gonna see how many more Batman villains we can shove in here Hey, is there any other obscure Batman villains that we haven't tackled yet?
7140158	7146963	You know, maybe we can just get Lex Luthor in there because we're running out of Batman villains Your opinion does not even count, you haven't even played the game
7148499	7149379	You lose!
7149399	7150380	Good day, sir!
7150400	7151300	I am totally enjoying this.
7151960	7153381	I'm just sitting back going, mm-hmm.
7153561	7154401	He's an idiot!
7154561	7154981	Tell him!
7157262	7158243	Rob thinks you're an idiot.
7159763	7160303	Cool.
7161124	7162304	I don't care what Rob thinks.
7165505	7166866	Well, we care what you think.
7168226	7172628	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
7172748	7174148	You know, if you want to call Loki an idiot.
7174449	7175549	You know what?
7175649	7177970	I'm such an idiot because I actually don't have the mailbag pulled up.
7179315	7180996	DarkSakura, you're an idiot too!
7181136	7182917	I'm surrounded by idiots!
7183597	7185498	No, you're surrounded by assholes, it's different.
7185518	7186859	I'm gonna go play Arkham City.
7187439	7188860	Hold on, I'm pulling it up.
7189860	7197084	It's just, I've been sort of doing some damage management of a severe nature.
7197464	7197864	Okay.
7198905	7200085	Sorry, I'm pulling up the email now.
7200286	7200666	Alright.
7201586	7204988	I want gossip, girl, you gotta tell me about this after the email bag.
7208200	7211081	I played Arkham Asylum at E3.
7211101	7212161	You know what game I hate?
7212361	7213301	Earth Defense Force.
7213441	7213961	That's fine.
7214242	7214902	Oh, Lord.
7215202	7216102	Now you're just trolling.
7216162	7217022	It's for bros.
7217242	7218123	Oh, I've never played it.
7218303	7219203	Now you're just trolling.
7220723	7221683	They see you trolling.
7221703	7222224	They're hating.
7223824	7225024	Well, we only have one email.
7227665	7228385	Hello, OLR.
7228445	7229685	Another email from Belgium here.
7229865	7231326	Yay, Belgium!
7232958	7239826	Since Sony is doing so bad, I've been thinking lately, do you guys think Sony will have enough resources to launch a decent next-gen system?
7240206	7244291	It costs billions of dollars to develop and launch a new console and they don't have that kind of money.
7244911	7245552	I think they do.
7246133	7249336	Also, with their rating dropping, banks will be less eager to loan the money.
7249677	7254242	I believe Nintendo made the Wii technologically inferior because of money problems, or is this wrong?
7255700	7256280	You know what?
7256841	7258042	That's a damn good point.
7261124	7261744	I don't know.
7263065	7265647	The PlayStation 4 could end up being a bunch of smoke and mirrors, too.
7265847	7275013	It could be that this whole tech with the controller changing or whatever may be the big thing, and it's not really that souped up of a system.
7275393	7278215	I kind of think the internet would crucify them if that happened.
7278455	7282158	I want to see someone trying to separate their controller they have right now.
7282398	7286641	I broke my controller, I split it in two and it's not working like I saw in the picture.
7286661	7287141	It's supposed to.
7287221	7288982	I've said this before and I'll say it again.
7289283	7291944	I don't think Sony has to launch a new console next year.
7292925	7296307	Why not sell more PlayStation 3s by putting out amazing games?
7296828	7304953	You know, I don't... I realize a lot of people expect Sony to put out a console next year because of what Microsoft is doing, but... I don't even know if Microsoft's putting out a console next year.
7305774	7311578	That's all... Yeah, that's all... Remember, we're just listening to analysts that are speaking out of their ass.
7311678	7312038	That's right.
7312938	7315760	Thank you for watching!
7333873	7336494	As always, thanks a lot for making a new episode every week.
7336554	7336934	You rock.
7337034	7337274	P.S.
7337314	7339455	If we win the contest, I'll send you a box of Belgian chocolates.
7339815	7340396	Ooh, deal.
7340936	7342456	Totally, as long as they're dark chocolate.
7342696	7343457	Go vote now.
7343637	7345077	I'm going to share this with the chat room.
7345197	7346578	It's a playground.
7346618	7347498	It's volunteer.
7347738	7349479	It's for a good cause.
7349559	7350999	We totally support this.
7351319	7354641	We like games of all sorts, including the ones you play outdoors.
7354861	7355781	So good luck, buddy.
7355801	7356321	I hope you win.
7356701	7357922	And yes to the chocolate.
7358840	7359180	Peanut Butter
7386417	7386717	Really?
7387077	7387277	Yeah.
7387738	7388738	Like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?
7388878	7389718	Rob, they use Marmite.
7390419	7390559	Oh.
7390819	7391079	Yeah.
7391679	7391959	Weird.
7392479	7392979	You know what?
7393680	7400202	I did a candy exchange with Robert K. And he sent me... Oh, yeah.
7400562	7404404	Now, sadly, I was allergic to the candy that he sent me because I can't eat gummies.
7404584	7405544	Don't.
7405624	7406264	I would have eaten it.
7407205	7408205	I brought it, remember?
7408265	7409045	The Jelly Babies and stuff?
7409065	7409606	That's right, you did.
7409626	7409906	Yeah, yeah.
7410526	7415188	But I sent a bunch of these Baskin Robbins candies.
7415988	7419269	that were these hard candies flavored like Baskin Robbins ice creams.
7419289	7419810	Oh yeah, I remember those.
7419830	7420330	Those are good.
7420410	7421530	And he said he really liked them.
7421610	7422931	I also sent him cans of salsa.
7424651	7425772	Is that something you can't get over there?
7425972	7427372	I'm sure you can get salsa.
7427452	7434075	This was actually like the, what's the Mexican grocery stores called?
7436340	7436920	Oh, God.
7437080	7438821	But this is actually like authentic.
7439021	7441262	Yeah, down in LA, you see them everywhere.
7441302	7442663	I can't remember the name of it.
7442703	7443144	Carson something.
7443364	7443604	Yeah, yeah.
7443644	7444444	Carcinogen.
7445485	7445905	Well, okay.
7446125	7455191	What's funny is that Syl linked me to a website that, you know, I would never look this shit up, but it's a store in the UK that sells American imported goods.
7455271	7459193	And it was just hilarious looking at the stuff they were advertising on the site, like Captain Crunch.
7459253	7462595	I'm like, oh, I take that shit for granted that you can just get Captain Crunch at the grocery store here.
7463175	7469678	And even speaking of like Mexico, you could get, because how easy is it to get Yarritos, the soda, right?
7469718	7470219	Here it is.
7470619	7472200	I never saw one until I moved out here.
7473220	7477042	But especially like even at Target and stuff, you can get like the quote unquote Mexican Coke.
7477382	7478143	It's very easy to get.
7478163	7479203	They have a whole little wall.
7479243	7483065	I'll tell you what, you see it a lot during Passover because it's not made with corn syrup.
7483225	7483746	Ah, very true.
7484166	7486627	And corn is considered not kosher for Passover.
7486807	7488108	But you see it all the time at Target.
7488148	7490189	Like Target has their... Or throwback.
7491808	7493369	Jones Soda, I guess, is a thing, too.
7493409	7494569	Jones is so good.
7495169	7496630	It's even kind of hard to find here.
7496770	7499810	I wish we could get one of the Thanksgiving boxes and send it over.
7500191	7505632	Because, you know, the gravy one is weird, but I hear that the cranberry sauce soda is actually really delicious.
7505692	7506452	Here's the thing, though.
7506512	7513814	Syl says she can't have it until February because she's on a lifestyle adjustment until February, so she can't get the candy until then.
7513854	7515855	But little does she know.
7516775	7517335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7544071	7558989	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to email us in a future episode meanwhile it's time for a segment we do every week here on the show often imitated never duplicated haha it's the FUs of the week
7575320	7586654	Um, F you to, uh, Misunderstandings, um, and, yeah, I'm doing, um, some damage control, it's not a big thing, well, really, um, it's just...
7588669	7588909	Yeah.
7589490	7600438	Anyway, um, and, uh, also, uh, FUs to, uh, the, what, three inches of water in my backseat on the passenger side.
7601318	7605841	Um, there's a seal broken somewhere in my car, and yeah, that almost cost me my laptop once.
7606502	7608343	So, yeah, that sucks.
7611505	7615488	Um, I guess FU to... I don't know.
7616069	7616389	I don't know.
7619518	7625682	BlackWolf wanted us to clarify that what you're talking about has nothing to do with VOG.
7634068	7635269	Nothing to do with VOG.
7635609	7637130	Everything's happy-go-lucky at VOG.
7637791	7638872	As far as I know.
7640473	7645417	Let's see, my FU of the week goes to sleeping so much.
7645637	7649780	Oh my god, you guys, it is disgusting how much I've slept over this weekend, but I feel great.
7650640	7651501	An FU to the weather.
7651641	7653883	It's been non-stop shitty for the past three days.
7654003	7655004	I'm thankful it's finally 30.
7655044	7655844	That makes me happy.
7655864	7656085	Shut up!
7656305	7657546	I don't like for a couple days though.
7660848	7662890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7686318	7686718	All right.
7687478	7691499	Let's move on with a couple more news stories, and then we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7691679	7692719	All right.
7693139	7697640	So there was a new Kickstarter for this LA game space.
7698400	7704522	And what's kind of unique about it, they're going to be creating some new games to kind of, I guess, go along with this.
7705382	7713924	And some of the games that they're getting created are actually by some pretty famous people, including they've got the creator of Katamari Damacy.
7716084	7718425	Kata Takahashi Adam Saltzman
7737552	7741495	There are going to be 30 new games from different indie developers.
7741535	7751661	They're pretty prominent, including stuff by... The guy that did Hotline Miami, Steve Swink of Scale.
7752421	7755683	And also, I guess, the guy that did Unfinished Swan.
7756423	7763328	And they're going to get Pendleton Ward also, who did... I guess he's doing a game with...
7765305	7773908	and Bennett Foddy who did QWOP and CLOP which I really need to go back and play because... Oh, God.
7774588	7775469	CLOP was awesome.
7777209	7780391	So, yes, they're going to be... It's pretty awesome.
7780431	7783232	If you pledge $15 or more, you get those 30 games.
7783952	7784172	Nice.
7784332	7784912	That's pretty awesome.
7784972	7790934	And $5 or more and you get that one game that's being done by the two first guys I mentioned.
7791375	7791595	So...
7792695	7793476	Definitely check it out.
7793576	7795657	They're probably going to hit their goal because they're looking for $250,000.
7795697	7799199	They have four days left to go and they're at $234,000.
7800719	7801480	I think they'll be okay.
7801620	7802820	I think they'll be alright.
7803021	7806582	Although, there was another one I did see that they were looking for $50,000 and they missed it by $28.
7806622	7810664	And if you don't make it, you get none of it.
7810805	7811365	You get none of it.
7811985	7812485	You can try again.
7812505	7813506	Yeah, that's true.
7814798	7823642	All right, well, lastly tonight, before we go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR and the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR, this is a bit of a visual.
7823702	7825683	I apologize, guys, but you can Google this.
7826423	7833666	The cover of the final Nintendo Power has been released, and it is awesomely nostalgic.
7833707	7835587	I think it's a perfect send-off to the magazine.
7836028	7837568	It ends the way it began.
7837968	7841270	The final cover looks a lot like the first cover.
7842731	7850594	The very first cover of Nintendo Power was Super Mario 2, and so you have Wart in the background, and you have the vegetables, because that was a big part of Mario 2.
7851414	7855296	The final cover of Nintendo Power is for New Super Mario Bros.
7855536	7862419	U, with Bowser in the background and Goombas, but still just the very similar look.
7862679	7865841	You clearly get the reference here if you've been a fan of Nintendo Power.
7866441	7874747	Also, it's very interesting when you put the two covers side by side, you really notice that on that first cover of Nintendo Power, Mario's color palette was wrong.
7874807	7875588	It was reversed.
7876148	7880551	He has the blue overalls, or excuse me, the blue overalls is right and the red shirt, but his hat, his hat's wrong.
7881172	7883414	So kind of interesting that that's all screwed up.
7883474	7885855	But regardless, a great send off.
7886316	7890579	And even like the same colors as a designer, Dark Sakura doesn't make you happy.
7891573	7892293	Yeah, for the most part.
7892433	7894734	I mean, it's actually a lot better laid out.
7896235	7897515	It's more dynamic, I'll say that.
7897615	7905417	But then again, the Nintendo Power logo, the new one, also lends itself to a bit more dynamic because of the differences in size.
7905978	7910079	I also just like, even the little POW is the same, the little POW poster inside.
7910139	7911199	Poster inside is like the same.
7911680	7912080	I love it.
7912620	7912800	So...
7913700	7931605	uh it makes me sad to see Nintendo Power Go but then again if I was going to be that sad I wouldn't have stopped reading it about like 15 years ago sorry not to be Debbie Downer but that's the reason why the magazines are going out of business so hopefully there'll be something else in the future maybe a newsstand app on the iPhone or something I don't know but we'll see
7932485	7936027	Anyhow, let's go to the phones.
7936047	7939968	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7940729	7950053	Oh, Actdeft catches this in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com pointing out the last issue has Mario going to the pole, meaning the end.
7950873	7951793	I didn't even catch that.
7952173	7953794	It looked like the halfway point flagged me.
7954174	7956595	Going to the pole because that's where he's going to work from now on.
7957836	7958316	On the pole.
7960476	7961636	Mario's not going to the poll.
7961656	7962857	That's a whole new era.
7963137	7964297	Mario's not going to the poll.
7964337	7965758	Those games still sell like crazy.
7966438	7969979	I guarantee besides Nintendo Land, it's the top selling Wii U game right now.
7970039	7977441	Yeah, but what's the way you're going to expand your demographic into the stripper market than getting, you know, strippers in your games?
7978221	7981962	Yes, because that's exactly what they need to get at Nintendo is strippers.
7982622	7984103	I think... I need strippers now.
7984163	7984883	I think they should.
7986673	7987014	All right.
7987474	7993021	Again, the phone's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7993061	7997247	Before I get to the Twitters, Loki, do you have any last minute comments?
7997267	8000150	Yeah, they have got some cool plug-ins for Gary's mod.
8000351	8001492	It's coming out December 6th.
8002653	8005374	and it's basically a Kinect PC plugin.
8005494	8009776	You'll be able to do body capture using the Kinect.
8010036	8017959	You're going to need Kinect for Windows Runtime version 1.6 but you're going to be able to do all sorts of funny stuff with Gary's mod with that.
8020240	8021501	Alright, let's go to the phones.
8021521	8022301	We have a call coming in.
8022341	8023241	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8023261	8023601	Who's this?
8023621	8025482	We see you tonight.
8027884	8029624	Yes, because I have a webcam now.
8029684	8030505	You sure do.
8030725	8031705	Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
8031965	8033185	You know, I need to get a webcam.
8034305	8035226	I still need one.
8036206	8038206	I know you answered the Google question of the week.
8038766	8042387	I saw it on my Facebook news feed earlier today.
8042407	8052129	I didn't get a chance to answer it, but there is one thing I am looking forward this holiday season is the supposed PS3 that my girlfriend is hinting at.
8053149	8056030	So I am, in other words, a new system is probably on my way.
8056838	8057718	Lucky you!
8058959	8066943	Well, I mean, it makes up for the fact that I got her a car stereo and the other Hanukkah present that will be forthcoming.
8067603	8070445	You never know, she might be a listener of this program.
8070605	8071525	You don't want to give it all away.
8072926	8075187	Well, actually, she doesn't listen to this.
8075387	8085832	I mean, video games is only a small fraction of her life, aside from taking care of wildlife and watching anime and British dramas.
8087282	8095587	But yeah, now that I'm going to presume that I'm definitely getting a PS3 this holiday season, I'm just trying to see where to begin from there.
8096448	8101070	Because this is like the first time I'm getting a new system since I got my 360.
8101511	8108535	Well, I was just about to ask you, if let's say you're right on your hunch and you do end up getting a PlayStation 3, what do you think you're going to get?
8109560	8121410	I'm probably going to get the games that I were hinting at, stuff like Gran Turismo 5, Metal Gear Solid 4, the Uncharted series, so pretty much all the PS3 exclusives.
8123403	8127786	There's no way I'm going to get any other multi-platform game than I would otherwise get on PC.
8128707	8147564	I think this goes to the argument that if you compare both Microsoft and Sony in terms of games that are more first party, it looks like if you compare them side by side, aside from Halo and Forza and Fable,
8148462	8154884	You have a bit more first party titles on Sony's side than you would in Microsoft.
8155325	8157325	Anything in between is just multi-platform.
8158026	8164208	Since it came up earlier, we were talking a lot about how Sony has a lot of great download stuff on PSN that people are overlooking.
8164248	8169510	Do you have any interest in Journey or the Swan game or Unfinished Swan or any of that stuff?
8170630	8173812	Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to it.
8173872	8176813	I'm looking forward to Home in particular.
8177898	8179700	and seeing what that thing's about.
8180021	8185188	But more importantly, I guess after I get the PS3, then I have to figure out which high def TV I'm looking for.
8186269	8193278	Because I'm putting it off, to be honest, trying to find something that's really fast, that's under one frame of lag.
8194346	8199432	because, you know, for my rhythm and dancing games, I need something really fast.
8199912	8209723	And in case of fighting games, so it's like I'm really holding off until I find something, something that's tried and true that others have used with certainty that I can easily buy
8210484	8212205	in my local Best Buy that same day.
8230513	8237154	Right, but that's contrary to what I'm hearing in the Shoryuken forums on, you know, the big fighting game community site.
8238315	8247736	In their tech talk section, they do have, you know, they have like threads for sub, you know, for sub one frame high-def TVs.
8247816	8252717	Most of them are just like, they're either available or they're just like discontinued.
8252817	8256458	But for the most part, it's monitors that are damn near lagless.
8256478	8256698	Yeah.
8256718	8276361	You have some comments in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com ShiningForce3inator Hey, that name's gonna get you arrested Says, I put up a thread on the VOG boards with some PS3, PSN recommendations And Brad from PodCulture suggesting a Vizio Go Vizio, it is the best bang for your buck Not at Best Buy, Wally World, or Costco
8277233	8280334	I'm not going to Walmart, but... I got mine at Costco.
8280454	8281895	I actually had a great experience at Costco.
8281915	8282355	I can't complain.
8282395	8287758	I just need something that I can play 2DX on and occasionally fight games.
8288018	8288418	Of course.
8288698	8292900	That is fast, that I don't have to offset for timing.
8294423	8297087	and then I would pick up a high FTB amount on my wall.
8297167	8305778	And then maybe someday Konami will put out, now that they've gone HD with 2DX, they'll actually put out all they've missed on like one Uber PlayStation 3 game.
8305798	8306599	At least we can do that.
8306619	8306820	Sure.
8307000	8307440	Sure.
8307921	8308282	Right.
8308422	8308983	And then
8309343	8313044	That's the day when, like, pigs fly from the skyline.
8313124	8313804	Exactly.
8314144	8316205	That's the day when Rock Revolution 2 is announced.
8316485	8321286	Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but thanks for the call, and I hope you do get the PS3.
8321326	8321646	Good luck.
8322386	8322707	Alright.
8322867	8323467	Alright, take care, buddy.
8324347	8324747	Bye.
8325887	8327028	I like the video.
8328939	8331681	I want more people to call in with video even though it's a radio show.
8331721	8332641	At least I'm amused.
8332921	8336324	But please, for the love of God, make sure you're decent if you're going to call in on video.
8336844	8337684	All right, Loki.
8338785	8339766	Any other stories?
8342167	8347691	Microsoft Vancouver is now Black Tusk Studios and apparently they're working on the next big franchise for the Xbox.
8348711	8351033	Oh, like something for the new Xbox maybe?
8351053	8353194	Just whatever the next big AAA franchise is going to be.
8355175	8356176	What could it be?
8358218	8365668	Going to the Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR Spazinator wants to know What are the odds of a Gangnam Style parody with a Mass Effect theme?
8366049	8366890	Garrus style anyone?
8366910	8368232	You mean that hasn't already been done?
8368392	8371677	It has been done Check out, there's this thing called Tumblr
8373305	8378647	I was going to say, it's definitely possible now that they have, was it the JibJab app or whatever, you can upload pictures of people.
8380188	8381249	So, true story.
8381889	8391173	The other day, I was looking up YouTube videos, and I just, I found myself on Psy, and I was like, I wonder if his other music's any good, and I was looking at one of his other songs, and I was like, alright, this is kind of cool.
8391193	8392013	Passionate Goodbye is really good.
8392334	8399597	And then, if you look on the right side at all the related videos, it was all of these Psy videos, like Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy, Psy.
8399877	8401798	But then there was this one video towards the top, and
8402558	8405640	Hippopotamus takes a massive dump at the zoo.
8407461	8408942	Guess which one I clicked.
8411664	8414306	And I was like, this is more interesting than the side video.
8419309	8419649	All right.
8421430	8423652	Did you hear that Glee did Gangnam Style?
8424092	8424652	Oh, God.
8424672	8425813	Do they actually speak Korean?
8426488	8426928	I don't know.
8427329	8427909	I'm sure it's terrible.
8427929	8428690	You know what, Rob?
8428750	8437678	When I was discovering Adventure Time last night, after five seasons of not ever watching any of it, I found that someone did an Adventure Time Gangnam Style.
8438519	8438999	Good lord.
8439119	8444464	Really, the one you should look up is the Gangnam Style crossed with Too Legit to Quit with NC Hammer.
8444484	8444724	Yeah.
8454351	8455512	I'm offended just hearing that.
8455532	8456813	That just sounds wrong.
8459676	8460536	Let's go to the phones.
8460777	8461878	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8461898	8462278	Who's this?
8463899	8465260	This is Haseo Sumuragawa.
8465521	8467202	Hey, how are you doing?
8468963	8469844	I'm doing pretty well.
8470204	8471946	What's on your mind, Haseo Sumuragawa?
8473667	8481714	Well, I was, uh, you know, putting my, uh, my bid for, uh, the trophy, uh,
8482210	8493976	Wait, wait, you're putting in your bid for being a trophy whore among the listeners?
8496238	8511826	It's supremely cheap to, and if you haven't played them yet, to pick up the God of War saga, because then it's three main games on disc, and you get a download voucher for the PSP collection.
8512999	8519043	Ah, and I bet you can find that pretty cheap these days, because that God of War collection came out like a couple years ago.
8519103	8520024	We actually have it, too.
8524006	8538997	They recently re-released it as the God of War song, because it originally was the God of War HD collection, which was 1 and 2, and then that came out right in time for 3, or around 3, and then they came out for 8.
8541234	8544996	HD Collection, which was Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta.
8545016	8548337	But with the God of War saga, you get all five games.
8549777	8551738	So you say you're the resident trophy whore.
8551778	8553359	What is your PlayStation level?
8555619	8553359	14.
8556140	8556900	That's pretty good.
8557140	8558580	I think I'm only at like 7 or 8.
8558841	8564623	But I don't, I mean, you know, do you play other consoles or like just, are you like only Sony in your house?
8567043	8568304	Only Sony, but you know, I'm
8568803	8587238	Thinking about maybe picking up a 360 to check out the games I miss on 360, such as Halo and Gears of War, because I hear good things.
8588764	8595566	Um, we've been talking a little bit tonight about how a lot of people have been overlooking some of the good stuff that Sony's doing.
8595606	8602208	Like, it doesn't seem like a lot of people tend to care about Move, and there's so much good stuff on PlayStation Network that tends to go overlooked.
8602748	8608470	As somebody who's a bit of a Sony fan, what do you think people are missing by not giving Sony more credit?
8610771	8618213	Um, first of all, they actually, um, the first variety of games, such as God of War, Infamous, and, uh,
8619792	8648168	the entire series are all really great series and I mean even like the download games like Journey as you mentioned earlier and Flow and Flower they're really great games and not to mention the PS3 has been getting a whole lot of the collections compared to the 360's
8650976	8651276	I gotcha.
8651296	8652177	Yeah, it's true.
8652237	8655800	They put a lot of that good stuff, like all those collections out on disc.
8655840	8658102	It makes a good point, like a good starting point.
8658462	8664027	Like the Journey collection, you know, has Flower and Flow and all that would be a great starting point for somebody.
8665508	8665808	Yes.
8667029	8675877	Plus, with that, I mean, it's... If I remember correctly, because my friend bought it, it was...
8677032	8685039	$30 plus you got a free month of PlayStation Plus and a whole bunch of player IDs and I think even a theme.
8685880	8686140	Nice.
8687181	8687722	Very cool.
8688362	8691205	Alright, well, before we let you go, is there anything else you want to share with us tonight?
8695549	8697150	Other Coins Revenge could have been better.
8698551	8699072	How so?
8701394	8703836	It was too short and they kind of
8705374	8706156	All right.
8706196	8709883	Well, no giving away the ending.
8710384	8710705	All right.
8711627	8712308	Well, take care, buddy.
8712328	8713129	Thanks a lot for the call.
8714512	8714933	No problem.
8715073	8715334	All right.
8715394	8715754	Bye-bye.
8717203	8721326	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8721426	8725108	Somebody there sticking up for the PlayStation 3 and giving some more recommendations there.
8725128	8727670	For the record, I have to say Megzi and Kristen say hi.
8728310	8729211	Hello!
8729771	8732553	And please ask when they're coming to California because we miss them.
8732793	8733293	Okay, I will.
8733353	8738617	There is a whole new generation of OLR listeners that have no idea who the OLR lesbians are and they need to be introduced.
8738777	8739417	They need to return.
8739517	8739958	That's right.
8741235	8744497	Remind them that episode 500 is coming up.
8744517	8746638	Alright.
8746658	8749759	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8750159	8752080	A couple tweets from SSJ100 Matt.
8752901	8754842	An idea ahead of its time from Sega.
8755262	8759344	Arcade Heroes takes a look back at the Sega Super Circuit from 1989.
8760144	8767187	It links us to a story from Arcade Heroes which I'll get to in a minute after this call.
8768688	8769749	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8769789	8770169	Who's this?
8772113	8772813	Word, dog.
8773274	8774114	It's Jim Sally.
8774614	8776035	Holy crap.
8776275	8778156	It's video.
8778396	8778956	Oh, my God.
8778976	8780097	Jim Sally's on the video.
8780597	8781897	Are you in the bathroom?
8783678	8785359	With him moving back and forth and all that?
8785379	8787160	Well, no, that wall looks like tile, like bathroom.
8787300	8788260	Oh, no, I see.
8788940	8791642	It did have a little bit of that vibe of the sitting on the toilet video.
8791662	8792802	Sitting on the toilet.
8793402	8793702	Oh, my.
8794163	8794963	Dude, you're on a roof.
8795043	8796444	It's the Canadian skyline.
8796464	8797724	He's outdoors smoking.
8798284	8799325	That's what they do in Canada.
8799926	8800546	We'll see you next time.
8823578	8824839	I'm in my tundra gear here, man.
8824879	8826219	Look, I'm all dressed up for the occasion.
8826299	8826679	See that?
8827079	8827700	Looking fly.
8828120	8829881	I'll give you an auction shot.
8830821	8837304	Thank you for wearing clothes when you call into the show because I'm afraid one of these days... I am disappointed at the... No, I'm kidding.
8837604	8837944	Stop.
8838284	8839625	I'm afraid that one of these...
8840645	8842306	Dude, look at those guns!
8842646	8844006	Jim, it's a radio show.
8844066	8845887	They're not going to be able to see your muscles.
8846167	8848308	That was just for you, Rob.
8848328	8849668	He's invited us to the gun show.
8849788	8851649	You know what I'm saying?
8851929	8853669	Here's my fanboy hearts and eyes.
8853769	8855430	I wish we don't have a webcam in return.
8856050	8856570	We'll get one.
8856590	8857451	We're going to get a webcam.
8858071	8860532	I like to just hear your soft voice anyway, buddy.
8861912	8863252	The webcam is at my house.
8865013	8867974	It's like I'm looking at you in the studio right now.
8869629	8869990	Here's me.
8870030	8871451	I'm going to give you a kiss on the cheek.
8874474	8876255	This is great radio, guys.
8876635	8877416	Great radio.
8877556	8878417	How smiley I am.
8878497	8879378	Okay, let's do radio.
8879758	8880579	Let's do radio.
8880699	8880979	Let's go.
8881219	8883982	Jim, what kind of games have you been into lately?
8884662	8887024	Oh, man, you guys talked about the Golden Axe not too long ago.
8887064	8888566	The great Golden Axe game on Sega.
8889626	8892509	Oh, I do remember playing that game and being vicious with my friends.
8892529	8896012	We used to play only two players at a time you could have, but there was three of us.
8896775	8899397	So whoever died would have to hand the controller off to the guy sitting out.
8899537	8901319	And that was pretty much how we played the game the whole time.
8902019	8903460	There were a lot of punch buggies, man.
8903480	8908924	We used to freak out when those little trolls would come out, and if we got to kill the trolls, we would usually kill each other, and then never get to the second level.
8910105	8913808	That's a hilarious style of gaming I haven't seen since I was young.
8913868	8918192	But yeah, we used to do that too with Mario Brothers, is that, oh, you died, hand off the controller.
8918412	8919533	That's right, pass it off, right?
8920153	8921434	I think that's from the arcade, right?
8921454	8923696	Because you die, someone else gets to put a quarter in.
8923716	8924777	That's true, that's very true.
8927588	8928348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8954904	8957187	Oh my god, he has a hat that says Jim Sally.
8957388	8959390	Dude, I have a whole line of hats that say Jim Sally.
8959410	8959991	Here, check it out.
8960131	8964117	Is that like a clothing line we can check out on Cafe Press?
8964137	8967622	You have to tell me what text you're using because it looks kind of like Cooper but not really.
8968787	8987986	I think that this was like Jungle Geeks or something, I don't know, I use different texts, whatever they have at the, I use lids You need to do a Helvetica one, and make it look extra designed This show is getting too nerdy for me Rob just doesn't know typography I love though that we're getting a little glimpse of Canadia right there, I hope you don't, is that snow on the ground?
8988697	8989217	Dude, look at this.
8989297	8990718	I had to shovel this shit, man.
8991419	8992259	Just not too long ago.
8992559	8996041	What's that white mythical stuff?
8996301	8997402	We're from California.
8997522	8998763	Like, I'm like, ooh, what is that?
8998803	9000444	But for the record, it does snow in Alabama.
9001184	9003685	And it does snow 45 minutes up the hill here in California.
9003705	9007047	Because we are, like, less than two hours away from Lake Tahoe.
9009031	9009912	I can handle the cold, though.
9009932	9011273	Look at what you get when you shovel the snow.
9011313	9014916	Look at those.
9015056	9017258	Jim, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.
9017298	9018299	But thanks so much for the call.
9018559	9019300	Don't be a stranger.
9019320	9020021	I'm glad to hear from you.
9020441	9021922	Listen, I'm glad to hear from you guys, too.
9021982	9024104	And I just want to say that I'm an angel.
9024164	9025566	Look at this light shining in my face.
9026306	9028108	I'm looking at you.
9028128	9033753	I'm coming down for Christmas time and I'm telling you, be good to everybody you see.
9034548	9038651	because I'm watching you and I got a big eye.
9038671	9040252	You better look up.
9040632	9042493	You better look up.
9042573	9044795	All right, before this turns into the Blair Witch Project.
9044975	9047436	This germicidal call is brought to you by toothpicks.
9047716	9048457	Who knows what's in them?
9048677	9049878	All right, take care, buddy.
9050438	9051459	Love you, Rob Roberts.
9051499	9052339	Love you, Loki.
9052439	9053240	Love you, JB.
9053280	9053540	Bye.
9054241	9055301	Love you, too.
9056302	9056762	Mwah.
9058403	9060945	I can tell my husband I kissed another man tonight.
9063396	9065777	I think video is going to have to be a requirement pretty soon.
9068039	9069099	As long as I'm not on it.
9069820	9070240	It's fine.
9070260	9071501	We can point the camera over here.
9072601	9072901	All right.
9073281	9075183	No, I think it was a toothpick.
9075283	9076583	It was something.
9076663	9077304	Or it was weed.
9077344	9077644	I don't know.
9078089	9079890	Alright, I got more tweets.
9081330	9081711	Who cares?
9084032	9085312	Let's see, what am I looking at here?
9085972	9089054	Yes, this was the tweet that SSJ100Matt sent before that call.
9091015	9094656	There's a lot here, but it had to do with RC cars on a track.
9095837	9097377	And let me see if I can open this.
9097557	9105941	Actually, let me open this on the... This is why I should not use my iPad to do Twitter topics, because then I don't have the YouTubes hooked up to the stream.
9107622	9109143	I know, right?
9111764	9112584	No, it'll make a mess.
9116625	9117765	The joys of live radio.
9117785	9124128	I'm logging in right now to the right Twitter account because I have like four different Twitter accounts.
9125448	9126228	Let's go look at this.
9126248	9128189	I wanted to look at the YouTube that was attached to this.
9128849	9130129	Okay, here we go.
9134071	9134831	Fast forward a little bit.
9138683	9139123	What is this?
9140565	9143248	This is Sega Super Circuit.
9144529	9152577	You used deluxe outrun cabinets that allowed players to control an RC car on a large track that was set up next to the units.
9152778	9153338	That's awesome.
9153358	9155681	And using cameras mounted to the cars...
9157358	9159280	You got a first person view of your vehicle.
9159400	9160761	That is the best thing ever.
9161482	9162203	That's pretty awesome.
9162223	9164385	You know, Dan would flip his shit for this.
9165005	9165266	This is 1989.
9165826	9168168	Oh my God, look at the video.
9168188	9169409	That is so adorable.
9170130	9171191	Dude, that is awesome.
9171211	9172913	Dan would completely flip his shit for this.
9173253	9175275	Oh my God, that is so rad.
9176896	9179459	And it keeps breaking up when the car runs into the wall.
9183038	9192448	I love that.
9192689	9195031	Rob, I found a haiku from a friend of mine on Tumblr.
9195371	9198074	We're making Ranma work overtime with the Tumblr tonight, by the way.
9198355	9202619	All the links I've been talking about during the show, I'm making Ranma put on the Tumblr, so check that out.
9203340	9204101	That is so cool.
9204417	9205238	Everyone Else Sucks
9218991	9221572	Haikus are easy, but sometimes they don't make sense.
9221932	9224073	Haiku does not take an S to make it plural.
9225894	9232756	Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion creator, Ron Gilbert, wants the game rights back, according to another tweet from SSJ100 Matt.
9233617	9234197	Makes sense.
9234657	9236818	I'm assuming this has to do with the whole Disney acquisition.
9238338	9241920	Quote, yeah, I wish I owned Monkey Island, a Maniac Mansion, you know.
9242660	9243081	Mojang account
9264216	9264718	Uh-oh.
9264998	9265861	I'm not buying the game.
9265961	9266422	Uh-oh.
9266442	9267966	I'm preparing for somebody else to buy me the game.
9268006	9268888	You need to at least play the beta.
9269209	9269469	All right.
9270713	9272998	On the Tigerclaw tweets...
9274502	9276604	Hate using the classic controller on the Wii U?
9277084	9278865	Use the PlayStation 2s instead.
9279245	9288172	Apparently there's a conversion kit that's going to be going on sale in Japan that will allow you to connect a DualShock to the Wii U. You know, if you don't want to use the classic controller or what have you.
9289012	9289993	The kit's from Datel.
9290053	9293175	It'll cost about $25 or 1,980 yen.
9293496	9295177	It goes on sale December 8th.
9295977	9297538	No idea if this will be sold elsewhere.
9297719	9302462	That's so cool that you would spend more money on a conversion kit than the actual controller.
9303166	9304987	Sixaxis, all the things.
9306827	9308088	All right, let's see.
9308468	9315511	And also from Tigerclaw, Miyamoto wonders, is story really necessary when gameplay will do?
9316892	9320895	Well, just based on title alone, I haven't even looked at the story.
9320955	9327379	I think an ideal game has both, but Atari 2600 games, I guess, didn't really have a lot of story.
9327459	9329101	Well, they did if you read the instruction manual.
9329541	9331302	Sometimes you had to to visualize that stuff.
9332003	9332823	But let's see.
9335685	9338147	This is a link to a story from Gamasutra.
9338187	9340729	Again, I'm having to read this live because we just got linked to it on Twitter.
9341109	9343010	But looking at the quote here from Miyamoto...
9343971	9344031	Hmm.
9360736	9368020	who is this Taro Kudo, the creator of scenario design on the game, said, quote, I didn't think we necessarily needed a lengthy story like in an RPG.
9368500	9375603	Instead, we looked at the characteristics of a portable game that can be played little by little in small pieces and packed in lots of little episodes and ideas.
9376023	9378885	I always did like putting in little ideas, so I actually enjoyed it.
9379625	9390193	A good game doesn't need story, but, you know, it's nice to have if the type of genre necessitates it.
9390633	9396878	Like, you know, a football game might not necessarily need story, but could a story make it more awesome?
9396958	9401321	That's what makes wrestling games awesome, because it's like soap operas for broly dudes.
9401982	9407026	And lastly, from Degenerate Johnny tonight, OLR, which is faster, running or rolling?
9407046	9407266	Rolling.
9408151	9413372	Well, if you're a monk in World of Warcraft, rolling will give you a temporary speed boost if you spec the right talent for it.
9415953	9416233	Dark.
9416893	9418234	Depends if it's uphill or downhill.
9419894	9420594	That's a good question.
9421255	9424815	If it's a flat surface, I would think running is probably going to be a little faster.
9424855	9428116	But yes, if you're going downhill, rolling might actually be more advantageous.
9428236	9428737	And dangerous.
9429677	9430817	Consider your terrain.
9430957	9432177	Rolling and rolling.
9432418	9434138	That was a Street Fighter Alpha 3 ending.
9435598	9437400	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9437500	9439181	That's going to do it for the Twitter topics tonight.
9439301	9440902	Does that do it for Last Minute Stories as well?
9441043	9441623	Yes.
9441803	9444305	And that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9444806	9446907	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show.
9447208	9449630	We really appreciate your guys' support every single week.
9449950	9452472	Yeah, I know it's a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but you know what?
9452492	9455795	The last few have all been like three and a half hour epic episodes.
9455835	9460419	So, you know, a short one as the news is winding down for the year, I don't think it's too bad.
9460899	9463981	We are moving in, of course, to the year end and another year of Orange Lounge Radio.
9464441	9469104	And we couldn't have done it for the past coming up on 11 years without your support.
9469605	9472747	And all we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
9473087	9475428	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
9475448	9478690	Word of mouth is all we got, and it's worked out pretty well for us.
9479571	9484214	Before we pull the plug on the show, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
9484957	9485498	I'll start.
9485638	9493425	My final thought tonight is Fog of World is a very interesting app on the iPhone, but $5?
9495166	9499010	Have I just been spoiled by all the 99 cent stuff that's available on iOS?
9499450	9500771	I think $5 is a little much.
9501612	9502933	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
9503254	9508318	I've decided that if I'm ever going to wear a watch again, it's going to be the Hello Kitty Nuka watch.
9509279	9510580	Nuka makes awesome watches.
9511061	9511481	Just saying.
9512324	9514145	and lastly but not leastly, Loki.
9516667	9520469	I hope I get this stupid mob arena plug-in working because it's really frustrating me.
9520730	9521390	It's giving me a headache.
9523271	9526033	Alright, that does it for another episode here at Orange Launch Radio.
9526093	9534358	We will be back to do it all again next week and since we learned tonight that it is starting before the next show, happy Hanukkah to all our listeners out there who celebrate it.
9535019	9536780	Yep, happy Hanukkah.
9537128	9537549	There you go.
9537849	9538791	Have a great week, everybody.
9538811	9541236	We'll see you next time on Orange... Eat lots of latkes!
9541436	9543219	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
