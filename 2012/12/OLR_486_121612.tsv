27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	44000	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live for this, our 486th episode, December 16th, 2012.
44000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games
49000	52000	and gaming culture and so forth with my co-hosts.
52000	56000	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	60000	I am a happy, blissful person right now because I have Jojo's and coffee.
60000	65000	Now I made you explain this on Bobby Black Wolf's show so you gotta explain it here too.
65000	67000	What exactly are Jojo's for those that don't know?
67000	73000	They're like Oreos except they're the Trader Joe's brand so they're actually, they actually I think taste a little bit better than regular Oreos.
73000	78000	But these have like a candy cane filling in them so they are basically chocolate mint cookies.
78000	79000	Candy canes are great just saying.
79000	83000	They are and I put a picture I think of the box in the chat room but I can do it again.
83000	85000	I put one up on our site but I'll link a picture in the chat room.
85000	89000	Trader Joe's is like the best bachelor shopping store ever.
89000	90000	You know.
90000	91000	It's also.
91000	96000	I'm not like I'm not just for that audience obviously but you know it's it's a great place to shop.
96000	102000	Well I mean the thing that I like about it is that you can get really healthy good food for relatively inexpensive.
102000	105000	We actually spend less going to Trader Joe's than we do at the regular grocery store.
105000	108000	Now careful they're not paying us to endorse them so we don't go too far.
108000	113000	And I will tell you something if you happen to be someone who eats kosher actually is a good place to get kosher meat.
113000	114000	There you go.
114000	116000	And Hanukkah is all over right.
116000	117000	You've partied.
117000	118000	You partied it away.
118000	121000	Hanukkah ended at nightfall today.
121000	122000	OK.
122000	123000	Because it's eight days.
123000	124000	It started last Saturday.
124000	125000	Right.
125000	126000	I always forget like the sundown thing kind of.
126000	127000	Yeah.
127000	128000	I'm going.
128000	134000	This is the way that I tell people how to remember what days are for you know Jewish calendar.
134000	138000	In Genesis it says and the night and the day were the first day.
138000	140000	So night today.
140000	141000	Don't get all preachy.
141000	147000	I'm just saying that that's that that's why it's translated that way and that's how it helps me remember that it's at nightfall.
147000	151000	So say hello to tech master Loki.
151000	152000	Yeah.
152000	155000	Who will preach the gospel of hacking here on the show.
155000	156000	No I don't know.
156000	163000	I know but I would if I'm going to endorse anything I'm going to endorse the ultimate breakfast at Lumberjacks.
163000	164000	Yeah.
164000	166000	The ultimate breakfast is seen that thing.
166000	167000	The ultimate breakfast is fantastic.
167000	169000	It does live up to its name.
169000	173000	It is two pieces of French toast.
173000	176000	That's the side that comes on a separate plate.
176000	178000	The main plate is where the fun happens.
178000	180000	You get your choice of potatoes.
180000	186000	So I got country potatoes with you know cheese and you know green onions on it.
186000	192000	A half pound of ham four sausages four strips of bacon and eggs.
192000	196000	And it's welcome to America and America.
196000	198000	And what's great about the bacon.
198000	199000	You know most places I have to go.
199000	202000	Hey can you can you cook the bacon crispy.
202000	203000	This shit comes out.
203000	205000	It's perfect.
205000	210000	It is just like yes you can hear the snap of the bacon when you when you break it.
210000	211000	It's fantastic.
211000	213000	And it's so much food you can't eat it all at once.
213000	221000	I mean I eat a lot of food sometimes but that's like a meal for a few days.
221000	227000	And one of these days because I was looking at it and I thought about bringing it today.
227000	229000	But they have they have this burger that they take.
229000	237000	It's basically one of those burgers like they will take a picture of you when you order this burger because the burger is huge.
237000	239000	It's like the size of my laptop.
239000	241000	Was that the place that.
241000	243000	Well did you hear about the pizza burger thing.
243000	247000	Yeah I've seen that in like Japan or China or something like that.
247000	248000	Yeah.
248000	250000	So is it like the same thing like that big.
250000	252000	Yeah it's Lord it's giant.
252000	254000	It's a one pound burger.
254000	257000	And then you know all the other stuff.
257000	264000	It doesn't just have to be American dishes though because there's there's a faux place that Alan and I like to go to that's just up the street not that far.
264000	267000	And you know because they're they're open super late like till 1 a.m.
267000	270000	And it's such better late night food and like Denny's right.
270000	274000	But they do this thing called the faux king challenge where it's like this gigantic.
274000	275000	That's that place.
275000	276000	Oh that's right.
276000	277000	We have to go there on Christmas.
277000	279000	Yeah we do our little Christmas day.
279000	280000	Christmas day.
280000	282000	We always feel great.
282000	283000	Yes.
283000	285000	And I think the place is called like the faux king or so.
285000	287000	No that's not the name.
287000	289000	You eat your full king.
289000	299000	Yeah but it's it's the faux king challenge and it's like this gigantic ball bowl bowl of faux with like two pounds of meat and two pounds of noodles like it's insane.
299000	303000	Like we just we look at all the pictures in the wall of people who've ordered it and it's like oh my gosh.
303000	306000	You know what I think I should do the pho king challenge.
306000	307000	I don't think you can.
307000	309000	I think that's like two pounds of pork.
309000	310000	I don't know if you can.
310000	312000	You might you might have to.
312000	313000	I'm thinking about it.
313000	314000	Beg for forgiveness.
314000	320000	You know since they're bringing up epic mealtime and Chad did watch Epic Chef this week which is fantastic by the way.
320000	322000	I mean that needs to be like the Food Network.
322000	326000	It's kind of a cross between epic mealtime and like chopped which is great.
326000	338000	And then you know they present one of the ingredients is a suitcase of bacon because that's just you know the most unusual quantity of bacon ever a suitcase.
338000	344000	But one of the things about epic mealtime is they have a cookbook and the cookbook is actually in the quantities that they make it on the show.
344000	345000	So it's like OK.
345000	352000	This dish requires twenty five pounds of bacon and you know five pounds of beef and whatever.
352000	353000	It's fantastic.
353000	357000	Speaking of which my secret Santa got me four pounds of bacon and that's fantastic.
357000	363000	My secret Santa is my coworker and he knows that I love bacon.
363000	366000	Let's see Alan alchemy is in our chat room.
366000	370000	And I always say the fourth guest on our show is you guys live in our chat room.
370000	376000	We do tape live every Sunday night at vog network dot com the voice of geeks network six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern.
376000	386000	If you happen to be listening live participate with us in the chat room live dot vog network dot com where Alan alchemy says it's actually called full buck yet or something like that.
386000	391000	Yes thank you for just giving away where we lived to all the listeners because I just said it was right up the street.
391000	392000	No there's like 15 of them.
392000	393000	Yeah.
393000	394000	We see full boxing yet.
394000	395000	Does it.
395000	397000	It's not as funny as full king.
397000	398000	It's not.
398000	399000	It's not.
399000	406000	But I know I've seen the pictures on Facebook of the full king and you know obviously the play on words is why they call that the full king challenge and all that.
406000	409000	I think this the place is actually.
409000	418000	Yeah this is the same place as the one that's by American River College where I go to school people who don't do anything in my school.
418000	421000	But their food is amazing.
421000	424000	Seriously if you're ever up in this area go eat their foe.
424000	426000	It's fucking good.
426000	427000	All right.
427000	437000	We are going to get into our gaming weeks and all that fun stuff but I want to start off the show with a kickoff topic and I'm going to start off with kind of the whopper that's that's going on out there.
437000	446000	I kind of want to not get it out of the way but get it out of the way because I know there's a lot of you guys that want to talk about it maybe on the Skype line or what have you.
446000	463000	Obviously here in America we had a horrible horrible events that happened on Friday and just these this unimaginable tragedy that happened in a school in Connecticut and like I just like I can't wrap my fucking mind around how awful what happened is.
463000	475000	I mean it's just it is it is unexplainable like the madness behind what happened is truly unexplainable but that doesn't stop humanity from trying to explain it and trying to find a reason for it and trying to point fingers at things.
475000	484000	And I know we all saw this week how. Unfortunately the finger got pointed pretty quickly at video games.
484000	498000	In fact the finger for a short time was pointed at the wrong guy. The gunman's brother, a guy named Ryan Lonzo I believe was who went on this Facebook and said dude it's not me leave me alone.
498000	507000	Yeah right. So you know but that didn't stop hordes of people from because the media had already tried and convicted Ryan Lonzo.
507000	519000	They didn't stop people from going on his Facebook finding all these things he liked because you know people want to get inside the killer's mind they want to be inside the mind of what drives this person to madness and to do such terrible terrible things.
519000	528000	And so you know oh blame the video games. And so Ryan had liked a video game that we here at OLR ourselves like Mass Effect.
528000	548000	And what happens the Mass Effect page gets filled up with all this you've got blood on your hands you made a game that is responsible for this event happening and dah dah dah dah and all these these really really just jump to conclusions things and just hateful things.
548000	563000	And I understand that in times of tragedy we want to like wrap our heads around and find a reason like why and how could this happen and how can we prevent it from happening again and all this but that doesn't really excuse mob mentality.
563000	567000	No it doesn't. Which is what really happened in this case.
567000	577000	And it's kind of unfortunate because being a fan of Mass Effect as you know both Jamie and I are and you know obviously we've talked about it ad nauseum on this show.
577000	586000	But when I think about the most violent video games I know and things that have like horrific imagery does Mass Effect have some bad stuff.
586000	595000	Yeah, but is it the worst I've ever seen. Not by any stretch of that ending the original ending it drove them to actually have to share something with you that someone posted on Tumblr.
595000	605000	Sure go ahead. I reposted it on my Mass Effect Tumblr just saying no one plays Mass Effect and says whoa this is violence it's really inflaming my inner serial killer. No they play Mass Effect and then they cry.
605000	615000	Absolutely it's it's it's emotion you you make a lot of decisions about you know how what's what's the way to react here and and you can play the third one with no combat.
615000	630000	If you make bad decisions you will suffer for those decisions it's not just kill for no reason like other games like let's say Carmageddon or Postal or whatever and I'm not necessarily pointing the finger at those games and saying these games are the reason that this happened.
630000	632000	They also like Grand Theft Auto.
632000	633000	No.
633000	638000	But he liked Grand Theft Auto and the funny physics cars which I happen to love as well.
638000	641000	The falsely accused killer or the real one?
641000	644000	I don't know somebody. Everybody loves Grand Theft Auto.
644000	654000	But see the thing is I don't personally don't really care about what he was thinking. I don't care. I don't think that way. I don't want to think that way. I don't want to understand that kind of thought.
654000	664000	What I want is for people who have those mental issues to get treatment instead of you know hospitals losing their funding and putting crazies back on the street.
664000	679000	There is an angry mob that has grown out of this horrific event. There is an angry mob and they're coming for anything that they can relate to what caused this horrific crime. Do we need to talk about it? Absolutely.
679000	681000	What caused it? Bullets coming out of a gun.
681000	689000	Well yes but I mean there's obviously you know what what drove him to it and so forth. There's no easy answer.
689000	704000	This is the problem is that I don't think necessarily we'll ever be able to explain what drives a person to do something like that because the rest of us are rational people and we don't think irrationally like this person did in this scenario.
704000	717000	Like that's a good thing that we're not capable of getting inside that man's head. Right? Like we shouldn't be able to know that because that's a dark dark dark place.
717000	733000	Well if I can reference one other thing. Sure. There is an article written that's on the Huffington Post it's been floating around about a woman who has a child who has they don't know what exactly is wrong with him but it causes him to lie and lash out and do very violent things.
733000	745000	You know things that they're saying that he has in common with the the gunman. You know and but they said that they can't do anything for him until he does something that gets him convicted.
745000	753000	You know you can there's no public mental health to take care of that kind of thing. They don't treat them until they've committed a crime.
753000	760000	Well there's a lot of there's a lot of politics that's going to come out of this and it's going to be around mental health and health care in general it's going to be around gun control.
760000	768000	It's going to be around you know access to getting into schools and all of this stuff and I don't really want to get into the politic part of it right now.
768000	775000	But what I do want to get into is I want to get into the fact that you guys better be ready because gamers are going to get blamed for this whether you want to be or not.
775000	786000	And if you don't believe me why don't I play a clip from you from one of the major news networks that a lot of people watch on the day of the shooting. This clip from Fox News.
786000	794000	We learned that he's 24 years old the shooter at the mall shooting near Portland, Oregon.
794000	803000	I want to point out Ryan was 24 years old Adam was 20 so this was still during that whole time where yes the media was perpetuating false information.
803000	808000	But again we're looking for that reason we need to point our finger at something to blame.
808000	811000	Oregon earlier this week was 22 years old.
811000	826000	I mean these are young guys doc and you mentioned earlier that sort of how people lose themselves in certain online activities gaming what have you and I don't know what the background was of these guys but it doesn't seem totally coincidental that they're both in their young 20s and young men.
827000	829000	I don't think it's coincidental at all.
829000	836000	I think we've got to look at these forces that empower people to get some knowledge through the Internet and so forth.
836000	843000	But there are a lot of dehumanizing forces that come with that reality TV is no friend of preventing such things.
843000	845000	Facebook is no friend of preventing such things.
845000	855000	I have to say and I think we're at a time again and we mentioned this earlier we've now pushed the red line of the unthinkable into kindergarten classrooms.
857000	865000	So if you're a 20 year old male and you play online games look out and you like Facebook look out.
865000	873000	It's basically old people just saying things we don't understand they're causing the problems in this world.
873000	885000	Damn that rock music in those comic books and and the television and the skateboarding and and those all those things that the children like I mean that's basically what it sounds like to me.
885000	887000	And then we call it Fox News.
887000	900000	In the same breath today I was listening to a.m. talk radio and in this on the car ride home from the city today and in the same breath that legislators are talking about gun control.
900000	907000	They're talking about and maybe we need to look at the violent movies and the violent video games as well.
907000	917000	So if you don't think that they're coming after gamers to try and blame this for what happened this unthinkable horrific tragedy.
917000	922000	Wake up. What can we do about it.
923000	932000	I think what we need to do is show the world that there's a lot of rationally thinking professional people that happen to play video games.
932000	937000	Yeah and watch movies responsibly because we're responsible people.
937000	942000	Rob 20 years it's going to be something else. They're going to point the finger at something else.
942000	953000	It doesn't matter though you can speak rationally I want but these people that are coming up with these laws and stuff like that that are trying to you know we need to censor games because it's causing people to be violent.
953000	959000	Those people are irrational as well so you can't argue with them because they're not rationally thinking anyways.
959000	965000	The whole the whole point is that and I'm really really trying not to get political.
965000	974000	I know you're showing great restraint but they need to start looking into the people themselves who do this not just you know.
974000	984000	And also I'm very irritated that they're trying to bring up that this guy had some form of autism which I know for I know plenty of people who are high functioning autistic who have zero.
984000	992000	But he did is the act of a sociopath or Asperger's like how quick were they to try and say that this guy had that and I don't know if we really know that or not.
992000	998000	I'm going to tell you how many people do I know that have a form of I'm going to tell you one thing about Asperger's right now.
998000	1006000	It doesn't affect your emotion it doesn't affect your ability to think as a rational human being or feel sympathy or feel anything for another person.
1006000	1015000	What it does is it sort of makes you look at things more causatively with a little bit more logic instead of the initial emotional response that most people have.
1015000	1022000	For example you know there would be how one person would look at this and then say oh the poor parents oh let's blame someone.
1022000	1028000	A person with Asperger's would more likely be like what caused this where can we get to the root of the problem how can we make sure this doesn't happen again.
1028000	1042000	That's the difference instead of you know and I know like I said I know plenty of people but the thing that they need to really look at is that this person had something that went wrong in his head that made him snap.
1042000	1048000	And a look at it too there's a little bit more in that the part with one of the people he killed was his mother.
1048000	1050000	What was going on between him and his mother.
1050000	1052000	What was going on at home.
1052000	1063000	What was the situation that formed this person that led them to that because a person is not just what they play a person is a collection of all the experiences that has made them who they are.
1063000	1068000	Perhaps he had some sort of form of autism perhaps he had some sort of you know behavioral disorder.
1068000	1077000	There are times where sociopaths who grow up become very very good liars and they can pretend to be like everybody else.
1077000	1086000	They can you know maybe look like they have a dissociative disorder when instead they really don't have that same emotional connect to other people.
1086000	1087000	They don't feel that way to other people.
1087000	1092000	They don't care and no amount of therapy is ever going to change the brain of a social sociopath.
1092000	1096000	They need to be taken off the street.
1096000	1100000	It's a tough situation. This is a question that's not going to be answered for a long time.
1100000	1114000	The point and why I wanted to bring this up however is that I'm just I don't because I'm a gamer and this person who did the unthinkable is I guess being paid as a gamer although we don't even really know if he was or not yet.
1114000	1124000	I do not appreciate being put in the same bucket as this guy. Do you?
1124000	1138000	I'm a professional person with a professional job who's done the same thing for like 11 years and you know has run this podcast for 10 years and so forth and you know I have I'm a I'm a mature when appropriate individual that happens to enjoy video games.
1138000	1142000	Does that make me a bad person?
1142000	1154000	So if they if they decide that like the minute these legislators and so forth decide to loop in games as to what causes people to go bonkers I'm saying enough and I plan to fight it.
1154000	1162000	Same here. And I hope you all will fight it too. That's why I wanted to bring this up tonight. We need to fight this image.
1162000	1173000	But the whole point. Don't come at it with an emotional need your reaction to it. Come to this with logic and rationality. Have your facts ready.
1173000	1190000	You know talk to the ECA the Electronic Consumers Association. The ECA is probably one of the single best resources for information statistical information that's going to combat anything that faux news or anybody can throw at you.
1190000	1197000	And by the way don't just write off Fox News. There are people out there who believe everything that comes off of them. My mother is one of them.
1197000	1207000	Well and it's not even like almost every news station. I think NPR was the only one who didn't peg this the 20 the wrong person in the beginning.
1207000	1215000	It's not just like I just happen to have that clip because I stole it from game politics. Thanks. But it's not specific to that particular news network.
1215000	1226000	I mean no matter where your political leanings are how you feel about certain stations or what have you misinformation was everywhere this week including Facebook including Twitter and all of that stuff.
1226000	1238000	So as we try to find a reason for the unthinkable. Anyhow I don't mean to stray too far from what is supposed to be a light hearted escape topic.
1238000	1255000	We do play video games. Yes I am a gamer. Games are what I play to escape the world for a little bit just like a lot of you guys watch movies or TV shows or role play or draw paint read comics whatever it is.
1255000	1265000	A lot of these things are ways to you know break break out of the quote unquote real world for a little while when all this crazy crap is going on.
1265000	1283000	And seriously look at history. You know back in was it the fifteen hundreds. Are you familiar with the term called the bonfire the vanities. I remember the movie the bonfire the vanities were when the religious groups were going around saying that the modern stream of art in the early Renaissance was responsible for debauchery.
1283000	1294000	And I mean come on we're dealing with the Dometicis who were half popes and half killing off their relatives who were saying that all of this opulence and grandeur was a result of the artists and the music at the time.
1294000	1305000	So they were going out and burning paintings. Well is this much different than you know what happened then. Instead of that they're looking for another scapegoat and they're banning things and preventing them from being released.
1305000	1313000	We had the same thing with the records being played backwards in the 70s and 80s. I mean this is history. Why don't we fucking learn.
1314000	1327000	Totally. Why don't we just look at our history and finally fucking learn something pork chop in our chat room at live dot vog network dot com says soon they'll be T-shirts saying games don't kill people.
1327000	1339000	You know funny enough the ECA was giving out shirts at E3 or packs or one of those expos and it has a picture of the various controllers and it says contrary to popular belief these things do not make me a killer.
1339000	1357000	Love that shirt. I have mine. I need to fix the shoulder that shirt. I've repaired that shirt like twice case or Sarah in the chat room at live dot vog network dot com says I do wonder about the impact on a person who solely plays violent video games for a disproportionate number of hours a day specifically high consumers with social disorders.
1358000	1373000	And you know what you said the key word social disorder. Well and the fact that you know you solely play violent video games for a disproportionate that that implies that that person doesn't know when to put the controller down and needs like like a teenager a young adult or a child.
1373000	1387000	That's where the parents need to step in and watch what their kids are playing and make sure it's not a disproportionate amount. You know that's that's I think where somebody else has to step in and say you know enough turn off the TV.
1388000	1404000	And I know I've brought this up before. There was an episode of Penn and Teller bullshit where they took a seven year old and then a former I think he was a former Marine and you know the kid loved playing you know first person shooters.
1404000	1415000	He was really good at it and the Marine was a player too took him out to a fiery range and had him shoot off three rounds of a semi automatic gun. The kid busted out in tears and said he never wanted to look at a gun again.
1415000	1425000	And that's that would be me right there. I don't like guns. I don't want to touch a gun. Well I'll I'll do the carnival. That's that's our late light guns. Duck Hunt is about as long as I'm going to get.
1425000	1443000	I like target shooting. It doesn't mean that I want to turn it on a person. I like point blank. Well for example a friend of mine more like an acquaintance was doing an inspection at a home and a homeless guy came in and charged her and she shot him and she got away and he probably would have attacked her.
1443000	1454000	You know but even after that she was sitting in her car hyperventilating for having wounded somebody, you know, having a gun doesn't make you a killer being a killer makes you a killer.
1454000	1470000	I want to move on and get into back into video games. It was a topic that had to be brought up though so thank you guys for sitting through it really appreciate it. If you have some, you know, put together thoughts on it you want to email us mailbag at orange entre.com, we will take phone calls later in the show if you are brave enough to bring it up live here on the show.
1470000	1482000	But we do have a lot of video gaming topics want to get to, I want to close with you guys the listeners with some final comments here in our chat room case or Sarah with another good line here. I think it's like a buffet.
1482000	1486000	Nobody should only consume one thing all the time.
1486000	1498000	That is a good thought. And this is a great picture. Um, let me get what was that the what is the contrary to popular opinion these do not make me a killer. Well, except maybe the remote that shit's dangerous.
1498000	1505000	That's not, it's kind of like the shirt but yeah, yeah, I'm going to give a mortal king the last word on this because I think this quote is great.
1505000	1513000	I remember a saying from my teacher. If we don't learn from history. We are doomed to repeat it, whoever learns anyway.
1513000	1525000	You know, that's a great line, it just people need to put it into practice. Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of stuff we have been playing around the gaming world this week, dark soccer what video games you've been playing.
1525000	1542000	I played Mass Effect for eight hours yesterday. What was that line about, nobody should consume one thing all the time. I was sitting in my pajamas with a headache and not feeling well all day so I sat back and played all the Mass Effect I wanted and it was glorious.
1543000	1556000	Glorious and most of it actually wasn't combat just saying, I will tell you though if I had to consume one thing all the time it would probably be these Joe with the candy cane, you would be so anemic and just and fat.
1556000	1565000	What's what's that character from Adventure Time the princess, the glob princess. Yes. Yeah, we'll have to get you a little crown.
1565000	1570000	So I did play some well, long enough to talk to a few of our guildies in both guilds.
1570000	1583000	And I tried, I was looking up and down for one of our wired Xbox controllers, because I really really really really want to play Sonic Generations, and still haven't been able to find the wired ones.
1583000	1587000	So, oh and jackpot.
1587000	1590000	Good times jackpot.
1590000	1592000	Loki.
1592000	1596000	How you doing, good, I quiet through that topic.
1596000	1605000	I don't blame you. I don't blame you. All right, well how was your gaming week. Um, it was all right I played a little bit of Far Cry three.
1605000	1621000	Some modern warfare three, no black ops to this week, at least I don't think we did we were going back to. Now here's the funny thing is our network at work has been kind of crap, we get disconnected like all the time we're playing Grand Theft Auto, you know, it was just a problem
1621000	1636000	where like someone would probably get disconnected during their game, our games, and it was just, it was a pain in the ass so that's why we kind of switched off of it to system link games because actually for a while there we had an issue where we couldn't even connect to live at all, because of the firewall we had.
1636000	1640000	Well, for some reason like on Wednesday.
1640000	1655000	I noticed when we were playing black ops to system like that, you know, it says what are not settings are in the bottom right hand corner and usually it's strict you always would get the, you know, when you log in live, you know, or do a network test or something like that
1655000	1672000	you know you're, you're not settings are too strict that you may be limited to what games you connect to and that kind of stuff. But for some reason, it said open. I was like, wait, that's odd, you know why, why is it doing that why does it say open it's supposed to be strict, that's really strange.
1673000	1688000	So I didn't think much of it. And then the next day, played, you know, some, I think we played black ops two again, and it said opening and I was like, that's odd. I wonder what's going on here. So I'm like, hey, you want to try playing Grand Theft Auto.
1688000	1700000	And so we we played some Grand Theft Auto, no disconnects and played Grand Theft Auto again later that day, no disconnects. I left it on from my morning to lunch, a good three hours, nothing disconnected.
1700000	1710000	I played during lunch, nothing. And then finally, I said, you know what, I'm gonna see how long this actually lasts. I'm gonna leave it on from 3pm to when I get in the work the next day.
1710000	1727000	So 14 hours, no disconnects. I'm like, what the fuck is going on? This is this is like unheard of. So we've been playing Grand Theft Auto, I'm probably gonna go back to it now, assuming the network stays the way it is, which I'm I am so excited about that because I've missed Grand Theft Auto so much.
1728000	1739000	So we're gonna hopefully be getting into more episodes from literary city deathmatch again because I need to get back up in the rank charts. I fell down the 120 because I haven't played in a while.
1739000	1752000	So I need to get back up there. You need to break 60 again. And it's ironically, though, we played so much of the non ranked deathmatch that I'm number five in the world.
1752000	1763000	So that was kind of fun. You're number five in the world? Yeah, but I mean, it's not ranked deathmatch. So OK, it just means I've we've played it so much that we've earned so much money that we're number five in the world.
1763000	1777000	And actually, my co-workers are like in the top 20. But yeah, in ranked deathmatch, though, in Balladegate, Tony, I was up to like in the 60s out of the 200,000 people playing.
1777000	1792000	So that's pretty good. And then what else did I play? I played a little bit more Minecraft. I've been fixing some of the stuff. I've been actually trying to go around the just updated Spoutcraft, which is a different client you can use.
1792000	1803000	It's basically it allows you to add some other plugins to your bucket server to allow for new objects, like actually new 3D things in there.
1803000	1813000	So you can add guns and planes and stuff like that other than you shoot the Slenderman. You can make the Slenderman appear, but you can make those happen.
1814000	1825000	Although those are part of Flan's mod, which he's supposed to be working on. He's out of or done with school right now. So now he's going to be updating his mod for one point four five, which should be done by Christmas, he says.
1825000	1831000	So I'm hoping to add that in there. And plus, that client runs a little bit better.
1831000	1841000	You know, if you don't want to bother with putting mods on like like some of the different shaders and stuff, then it works a little bit better for you.
1841000	1851000	And I tried as all right. I am going to update my laptop, though, actually, because this laptop, they have a core i7 model.
1851000	1862000	And what I'm doing is I'm going to actually pop the i5 chip out of it and put a i7 in there that I know will run and also going to double the RAM in there.
1862000	1874000	So I have eight gigs of RAM because that's all I can really update on it and also going to reset the the heat sink on it because it gets really hot.
1874000	1887000	And it's just because the thermal paste is crap. So I'm going to put some Arctic Silver MX4 on there and hope for the best because I've done all the cooling mods I can on this thing, other than like throwing a bunch of copper inside there.
1887000	1897000	And who knows, I may end up doing that, too. So that's I think that's all I played this week. Yeah, that was it.
1897000	1901000	Believe it or not, I played some new games this week. A couple of them.
1901000	1902000	No.
1902000	1908000	I know, right? I did not touch Mass Effect at all this week. I know, shock and awe, right? Not even multiplayer on part three.
1909000	1917000	I did play on the PlayStation Vita. I played DJ Max Technica Tune, right? A lot of you music game fans been excited about this one.
1917000	1927000	It's out on the Vita. You can download it in the shop. So I just did the download version because I guess the physical versions, you can get them through Amazon soon or you could have pre-ordered them.
1927000	1930000	I don't know. I didn't get on that bandwagon. I was like, fuck it. I'll just do the download.
1931000	1939000	Once I learned about the whole thing where you can back up all the files to the PlayStation 3 or the PC so I don't have to keep downloading them every time, I was like, I'll just download it.
1939000	1949000	Even though I only have a gig card in there, I'll figure it out. So yeah, DJ Max Technica Tune. Pretty good use of the Vita because it's a touch game, right?
1949000	1956000	Very similar to Elite Beat Agents, except there's no stylus. You kind of use your finger. The bar goes along the bottom and then it comes back along the top.
1956000	1964000	So it's kind of like, imagine like a race track and as the little bar goes around the race track, you have to touch the little dots in tune with the music.
1964000	1970000	But sometimes you drag them. Sometimes there are multiple taps in the same place, even though the bar might still be moving.
1970000	1976000	So you have to like, you might have to do little taps that are kind of disjointed a little bit. So it makes it weird to hold.
1976000	1982000	And then special to this version because it is the PlayStation Vita, they do the back tapping.
1982000	1992000	Good news about the back tapping, it's not in a specific place. You just have to tap the back because that would be like impossible because the back tap is really hard sometimes to hold the controller and do it that way.
1992000	2001000	But you can just kind of tap anywhere. So you can do the back taps in that mode, although actually the back tap is only in one particular mode.
2001000	2011000	There's like an easy mode, which I think is the pop mixing. And then the more medium mode is the advanced or the star mixing. I might have those transposed.
2011000	2018000	The star mixing is one of them. And then the club mixing is the like kind of non stops where you do like four or five songs back to back.
2018000	2029000	And the song list, you know, I haven't really been following the DJ Max series. I didn't really play. I mean, I saw a few of them on the PlayStation Portable.
2029000	2039000	I played the arcade version of DJ Max a couple times. Like I remember the song Flee, but that's not in the game. It's more of a new song list.
2039000	2049000	It's a pretty diverse song list, obviously very heavy on the K-pop. No, there's no Gangnam style. But since, you know, a lot of people are into K-pop right now, thanks to that song.
2049000	2056000	And I know a lot of you guys that were music game fans were probably into this style of music before. There's a lot of that style of music here that won't disappoint.
2056000	2071000	Like five songs from the band Step, who's like this Korean girl pop group. Very bright, very vibrant, lots of bright background videos, music videos that are very, very bright, especially because this is kind of a girl band.
2071000	2080000	And you know, those types of videos tend to be very, you know, bright and poppy and happy. There's lots of visuals in there that kind of can entrance you.
2081000	2093000	And sometimes the background videos can be a little bit distracting from the notes. Not too terribly, but I did find in a couple places I was like, oh, that was a bad thing for the background video to do because it kind of makes it look like a new note.
2093000	2112000	But let's see. Yeah, I enjoyed it. It's tough because it's a $45 download. And you know, in this day and age, you're spoiled by 99 cent iPhone games and so forth. So the value is really tough to justify.
2112000	2125000	But, you know, there's like 60 some odd songs in the game and I keep unlocking stuff and I've been having fun with it. You know, as a music game fan, there hasn't really been a music game I've been into in a long time.
2125000	2135000	You know, BeatMania 2DX kind of like stopped and I hadn't imported those games in the longest time anyway. So it hasn't been a whole lot for me to get really excited about lately.
2135000	2147000	So DJ Max is a nice little, this is a music game that doesn't feel like the same old shit I've been playing for a long time. It's not falling notes, hitting the bar at the bottom like it's something a little different.
2147000	2155000	It's something that could really only be done on the Vita as well as it is. I think it's a worthy purchase if you're a music game fan and a Vita owner.
2155000	2171000	But again, that $45 price tag, it's a tough pill to swallow when you sit it next to iPhone. This is why a lot of people are saying the iPhone and the iPad and iOS is really hurting PlayStation, Vita and 3DS.
2171000	2179000	Because, you know, those games are this much money and, you know, we can download decent games for 99 cents on iOS.
2180000	2182000	But there you go.
2185000	2196000	So Shane's yelling at me because the band is Cara, not Step. Step is their song that I keep thinking of and yells at me saying this review fails. Well...
2196000	2200000	Well, technically there is a band named Steps, isn't there?
2200000	2202000	I think there was, but...
2202000	2206000	Then they did some stuff for DDR, Euromix, I want to say.
2207000	2220000	But I'm not giving it a bad review. I'm just saying the price tag is a tough pill to swallow next to 99 cent, $1.99 iPad, iOS games. That's the reality.
2220000	2235000	So I may not be as in touch with the music games as I used to be, but, you know, if I'm having a hard time swallowing a lot of this stuff, what do you think about the general public who really has to be able to buy this game in order for it to be very successful?
2235000	2237000	Just saying.
2237000	2241000	So I played DJ Max Technica, which I did enjoy overall.
2241000	2251000	Also, I spent about an hour today, not enough time to really get my head around it, but I did play a little bit of Zombie You, which is on the Wii U.
2251000	2258000	Basically, it's Demon's Souls, but with zombies. I mean, for real. Like, the marking from Demon's Souls is there.
2259000	2268000	When you die, you got to go chase down your body, except now your body is another zombie. That whole thing is there. A lot of heavy influence from that series.
2268000	2272000	But I got to say, they do the Wii U peripheral and all that stuff very well.
2272000	2282000	Like, just the way they integrate the second screen. Like, a little scanner device that you use to kind of scan the room around you and also be an illuminating light.
2283000	2291000	When you have a sniper rifle, you can use it to zoom in on zombies and so forth. Just kind of neat the way they integrate the Wii U controller.
2291000	2294000	They almost do it better than Nintendo Land, which is a little weird.
2294000	2301000	The problem with Zombie You is it's not going to be for everybody. It's a mature title. It's zombies. Not everybody is into the zombie scary stuff.
2301000	2308000	But if you're willing to sit down and spend some time with it, it's a good launch title.
2308000	2314000	It's a really solid launch title that really shows off the system almost better than some of the first party games do, I got to say.
2314000	2320000	I haven't spent enough time with it. I still need to touch the multiplayer mode.
2320000	2326000	I hear there's a lot of Nintendo Network influence. Like, you find your friends zombies are out there in the world or whatever.
2326000	2337000	But just to give you an example, you will be out in the world doing your thing and then if you get bitten by a zombie, you're dead.
2337000	2344000	You're reborn as another survivor, basically. Another survivor is discovered and you show up in the safe house.
2344000	2350000	If you want to go get your stuff, you have to go find your old self and kill yourself, basically, and steal the bag.
2350000	2360000	I like that. It's neat. But it was seen before in Demon's Souls. But maybe Ubisoft is kind of banking on maybe a lot of people didn't play that.
2360000	2366000	I don't know. There's lots of Zelda knockoffs out there in the world. Why not a Demon's Souls knockoff? It was a good game.
2366000	2372000	Also, that same insane high level of difficulty. But I do have to hand it to the developer's team.
2372000	2379000	As much as I say, oh, it's Demon's Souls with zombies, the way they integrate the Wii U device is great.
2379000	2385000	So, I mean, it is a game that you can really say can only be done on the Wii U. So, they did a good job of that.
2385000	2393000	I didn't realize as well that Zombie was an old-ass game from Ubisoft, like, way back in the day on the NES.
2393000	2399000	That's why this game is called Zombie U. It's a spiritual successor to that game. Kind of neat.
2399000	2406000	I also forgot to mention in my game week, since it's not really gaming, but I finished my Koopa papercraft.
2406000	2408000	Oh, yeah, I saw that on Twitter.
2408000	2410000	Yeah, it's now standing at my desk.
2410000	2412000	Yeah? What possessed you to do that project?
2412000	2420000	Well, originally it was because it was going to have it for Josh's first birthday party. I was going to have that as a centerpiece or something.
2420000	2430000	I just didn't finish it because the design that I was working off of, the way they had it come together, I mean, it made sense if you were doing a 3D model.
2430000	2438000	Because the pieces clipped into each other. But in the real world, you can't just phase an object through something else.
2438000	2443000	You know, you need to actually have it attached to one surface to the other.
2444000	2450000	So I had to tweak the model and make it work. And it was a little bit more difficult and time consuming.
2450000	2455000	But now it's done! And it looks somewhat good. I don't know, it looks neat.
2455000	2457000	People are like, what's that?
2457000	2459000	It did look neat. I saw the pictures on Twitter. It looked pretty awesome.
2459000	2461000	Yeah, it's pretty big.
2461000	2468000	Alright, that's going to do it. Oh, one other thing I will mention, just in a very candid way, since you talked about pinball.
2468000	2475000	I played a theater of magic machine yesterday. For real. Not one of the download services or whatever.
2475000	2479000	I played a real theater of magic machine at a gay bar in San Francisco.
2479000	2480000	Theater of magic is awesome.
2480000	2484000	Alan and I went to the city yesterday because his friends are having a house party.
2484000	2486000	Which one? Does it want to know?
2486000	2492000	I don't know. Should I say it on the show? Oh, whatever. It's Pilsner Inn, which is over, it's like Castro and Sanchez, I think.
2492000	2494000	Oh, then I don't know that one.
2494000	2496000	I'm sorry, Market and Sanchez.
2496000	2500000	This place was awesome because it's all decorated with penguins. You know I love penguins.
2500000	2506000	And there's all these penguin decorations in there. And then they have a theater of magic pinball machine in the back.
2506000	2507000	Theater of magic is great.
2507000	2511000	This is like a bar that was made for me. And the guy gave me a free soda.
2511000	2512000	Aww.
2512000	2516000	Because I wasn't drinking. I was designated driver, so they give the free sodas.
2516000	2518000	Oh, that's cool. Keep you alert.
2518000	2522000	Even though we were walking, I actually wasn't really driving that night, but it worked. It worked out.
2522000	2524000	So, yes, I played theater of magic as well. It was hard.
2526000	2530000	It's not, I mean, it depends on how they have the rules set on it, but I mean, it's not that easy of a machine.
2530000	2539000	It was a five ball for the credits, but I swear that ball in there was weighted because it just flew down the table. It was crazy.
2539000	2542000	Oh, Alan's correcting me. It was Church and Market.
2542000	2543000	That was close.
2543000	2545000	I want to see the penguins now.
2545000	2547000	I don't know myself. Oh, I took a picture. I put it on Facebook.
2548000	2550000	I'll show you on my phone here in a minute.
2550000	2554000	Alright, but we have to get into housekeeping and then the real gaming news.
2554000	2558000	Housekeeping, join us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2558000	2562000	Speaking of Facebook, you can also follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2562000	2568000	We are also on Google Plus, and that's the place where you can always answer the foogle question of the week, which we'll get to in part B.
2568000	2572000	If you haven't answered it yet, now would be a great time. We'll get into that a little later.
2572000	2577000	Meanwhile, let's get into video gaming news, starting off with Loki.
2577000	2581000	Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about Steam and some of the updates they're doing.
2581000	2589000	They've got some new, well, they have the new wallet enabled, the Steam wallet, which will allow you to kind of tie with different community stuff.
2589000	2598000	Mainly, it's right now being used with Team Fortress 2, and it allows you to buy and sell items, I guess, using your Steam wallet funds.
2598000	2606000	So you can make some custom hats or something like that and sell them for fake money and then buy more custom hats.
2606000	2615000	It's all hat economy. But they've got that right now, and I'm assuming it's going to expand to other things later on.
2615000	2625000	So that'd be kind of cool. And then to kind of tie in with more of the community stuff, they're also launching game guides as part of the community beta.
2625000	2638000	And it's basically like game facts, sort of. People can create facts or guides or whatever, and then you'll see them on the different games.
2638000	2647000	You just click guides and you see all the user-made guides. So that's pretty cool. It's always good that they're adding more features.
2647000	2653000	Why do you think they want to put game facts into Steam?
2653000	2661000	Well, I think what they're trying to do is try to have it all encompassing, because if you think about it, if they're trying to go for this big picture mode and stuff like that,
2661000	2669000	they want you to stay in client rather than, oh, I've got to leave this client to go look up how to beat this boss or something like that.
2669000	2675000	They just want you to stay in the Steam client as much as possible, I think is the reason why they're doing that.
2676000	2681000	I guess that's pretty cool, because too many times when I've been playing a game and if I need the assistance of a guide or whatever,
2681000	2686000	I have to have that next to me, the iPad sitting next to me or a book even or whatever.
2686000	2689000	And they're not the only ones that have done that kind of stuff. I mean, look at IGN.
2689000	2694000	IGN, they're the same kind of thing. They have these wikis and guides now for different games, and it's all the same reasons.
2694000	2703000	Before with IGN, it was like, okay, get some game news and information and stuff, but, oh, I need to look up how to beat this boss or how to finish this level or something like that.
2703000	2707000	And before, you'd have to either go to the forums and hopefully there's a post about it there,
2707000	2714000	or you'd go to a Game Facts or something like that and go look it up, and once again, you're leaving their website.
2714000	2721000	They don't want you to leave their website. They want you to stay and soak in as much advertisement as possible.
2721000	2733000	Well, I mean, I guess it's also kind of like a valuable way to stay relevant, too, because so many people are after those types of guides.
2733000	2739000	It's a good way to kind of give visibility to your site and so forth. I mean, I guess it's just kind of how they're staying relevant in this day and age.
2739000	2755000	Alan in chat says, make Steam a one-stop-shop for all aspects of fandom. Buy the game, play the game, multiplayer matching service, mods, DLC, FAQs, chat and IM, friends lists, in-game overlay, alt-tab lists.
2755000	2759000	It's true. It seems to be what they're going for.
2759000	2761000	And fan fiction.
2762000	2764000	Soon fan fiction and Slash.
2764000	2766000	No, no, no.
2766000	2774000	There is no Slash pizza within Steam yet. Who knows? Shopping. Non-game stuff coming soon, maybe. Who knows?
2774000	2781000	Going to the Wii U, another place where apparently you can do a lot of things. You can go into Miiverse without interrupting the game.
2781000	2789000	That second screen there allows you to do a lot. But more stuff about the Ys in the Wii U. A lot of news that explains the Ys.
2789000	2801000	First off, why is there no online multiplayer in Nintendo Land? You know, a lot of people picked up Nintendo Land and maybe they don't have, you know, brothers and sisters or people that they live with to play the Nintendo Land games with.
2801000	2806000	So they have to wait for a party to come around to play a third of the pack-in games with Nintendo Land.
2806000	2818000	So why did they do it that way? Well, producer Katsuya Eguchi in an interview with Famitsu Magazine said, quote, Nintendo Land's multiplayer attractions work because of the communication shared between the people playing them.
2818000	2828000	They were set up from the start to be something people in the same room could enjoy. So in other words, they were ignoring the internet from the very beginning when it came to Nintendo Land.
2828000	2831000	And who was surprised?
2831000	2839000	Also apparently Metroid Blast was originally supposed to be a Star Fox themed mini-game. Did you notice that there was no Star Fox game in the Nintendo Land?
2839000	2846000	Well, Metroid was originally going to be Star Fox. Quote, generally it was easy to match the gameplay from the prototypes with one series or another.
2846000	2861000	For example, a game with air and ground battles works well with Metroid. There was a time when Metroid Blast was going to be a Star Fox title, but the prototype featured this vehicle that hovered around like a helicopter and we figured that'd never be a good match for an Arwing.
2861000	2870000	Interesting reason why they chose that. I mean, the Metroid thing works fine, but it's interesting to hear that like, oh, it was totally this other series before.
2870000	2879000	Also interesting to hear, kind of confirmation in a way, that all they did was take all those prototypes. What series can we shove this into?
2879000	2885000	What series can we shove into this? We got a chase game. Slap Mario into it.
2885000	2886000	I'm not surprised.
2886000	2894000	We got a race game. Slap F-Zero on it. We got a ninja star throwing game. We don't have that property yet, so just let it be ninja star throwing game.
2894000	2896000	No, it was a property that they had, I think.
2896000	2897000	Was it?
2897000	2900000	It was based off of some scare shit that no one even knows about.
2900000	2902000	It should have been Hogan's Alley.
2902000	2907000	It shouldn't have been Hogan's Alley. It should have been, what was it, the Konami title.
2907000	2910000	Yeah, but Nintendo's not Konami. Legend of the Mystical Ninja?
2910000	2911000	Yeah.
2911000	2912000	Go, Amon?
2912000	2914000	Yeah, sure.
2914000	2925000	Also, a follow-up to something we talked about last week. Why does Europe block the Wii U content late at night, the mature-rated 18-plus content late at night?
2925000	2929000	Well, Nintendo Europe came out with an explanation this week. Blame it on Germany.
2955000	2959000	Must be made available only at night.
2959000	2970000	And it was re-emphasized this is not the rule in the US. At least not yet. Refer to our discussion earlier in the show if you think that we may not be headed in that direction.
2974000	2978000	But anyway, it's nice to have at least a little explanation as to why.
2978000	2989000	But that does kind of have to suck if you live in a country where that stuff's not banned, but that's just the way it works sometimes overseas and even here to some extent. Because of state laws.
2989000	2992000	Don't buy the content digitally, then.
2992000	3000000	Unless it's DLC, in which case you're kind of stuck, but don't buy those games digitally. Go to the store.
3000000	3007000	All the more reason you should just go to the store where it's convenient and then you know what? Hey, I'm not playing Assassin's Creed 3 anymore on the Wii U.
3007000	3013000	Maybe I want to pick up the next Assassin's Creed game that comes out. Maybe I can trade in my old game, get some credit towards a new game.
3013000	3017000	Oh, can't do that with my digital copy.
3017000	3020000	Alright, let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura.
3020000	3025000	Mass Effect! Mass Effect all the things. All the mass effecting.
3025000	3032000	Actually, this is about Mass Effect 4, but I have an update to it before I tell the story.
3032000	3038000	This is coming from a story that was teased on Gamer Syndrome.
3038000	3049000	And Eurogamer, bless them, they actually heard from an EA representative saying that it wasn't Gamble, it was some other BioWare team member.
3049000	3054000	And so they went back and contacted Gamer Syndrome and said the source was actually unreliable.
3054000	3057000	However, I'm going to talk about it anyway because it's Mass Effect.
3058000	3069000	So the rumor, is what I'm going to put this as, is going that Mass Effect 4 is supposed to have information out next year and launch in late 2014 to mid 2015.
3069000	3072000	And they don't have an exact date on it.
3072000	3084000	They're saying that basically they haven't decided if it's a sequel or prequel, but that there is supposed to be one more batch of Mass Effect 3 DLC coming out.
3084000	3090000	Which, honestly, if it's that rumor going around that it supports the indoctrination thing, I'm going to flip a table.
3090000	3099000	But they were also talking about other scrapped ideas that they wanted in Mass Effect 3, like going to Palaven or, you know, different changes in the final battle.
3099000	3103000	And that they wanted multiplayer in Mass Effect 2, but it wasn't going to happen.
3105000	3109000	So, we'll see what happens.
3109000	3112000	I mean, it sounds like it's not far-fetched.
3115000	3120000	I think a lot of it is just theorizing though, you know, like it's so far away. They could change so much.
3120000	3124000	They probably talked to like some guy who was in the meeting when they were bringing up stuff for a timeline.
3124000	3129000	Although I do think it's funny that they used the brochure picture of him looking horrified.
3129000	3136000	I'm really happy to hear though that Shepard won't come back for Mass Effect 4 because it's just going to make Shane bitch and complain and cry.
3136000	3138000	I have my own head cannon.
3138000	3142000	It's okay, Shane. We can live in our own head cannons.
3142000	3148000	I think, well, here's the thing, and this is what I told Shane and what I say openly is that, you know, it's okay to start a new trilogy.
3148000	3158000	Because now that there's been so many games, it's going to be so hard to, in the fourth game, have all those choices for the first three games play out in the fourth game.
3158000	3164000	And you saw what happens when your choices do not play out into the way it all ends or ties up, right?
3164000	3166000	With that first ending to Mass Effect.
3166000	3170000	So, I think BioWare wants to just start a new slate.
3170000	3171000	It's new.
3171000	3173000	It's fine that they do that.
3173000	3177000	Because the first Mass Effect trilogy was so great, the second one will be too.
3177000	3182000	Did you hear, you know about the people doing the happy ending mod for Mass Effect 3?
3182000	3186000	Well, I finally watched one that involved Garrus as the love interest.
3186000	3192000	And you could, and actually, I told you I went back and hacked my game to get Kelly in my game.
3192000	3196000	They use that series of animations from when Kelly is hugging Shepard.
3196000	3202000	And so, Garrus' face does all this weird, like, his plates over his eyebrows move so funny.
3202000	3205000	It's absolutely hilarious. I'm like, he looks like a sad puppy.
3205000	3208000	So, just saying, it's funny.
3208000	3212000	As long as Mass Effect trilogies don't go the way of Star Wars trilogies, we'll all be fine.
3212000	3214000	Just throwing it out there.
3217000	3221000	It already can't because the ending of Star Wars 6, or whatever you want to call it,
3221000	3224000	the ending was, like, the best ending ever.
3224000	3229000	And the ending of Mass Effect 3, well, some people weren't so thrilled about it.
3229000	3231000	Anyhow, Loki!
3231000	3237000	So, we talked a little bit about how there was already some of the old homebrew stuff for the Wii
3237000	3240000	that was enabled with the Wii Channel on the Wii U.
3240000	3245000	But, the one thing that wasn't working yet was the homebrew channel.
3245000	3247000	However, now that's not the case.
3247000	3252000	The homebrew channel does work now because they've released a brand new version that will work with,
3252000	3257000	well, the original Wii, and also the brand new Wii Channel on the Wii U.
3257000	3260000	So, that's kind of interesting.
3260000	3266000	And, basically, that allows you to do some of the stuff that you could do before using the homebrew channel,
3266000	3271000	including, I think, run stuff off of hard drives, like, ISOs and stuff like that.
3271000	3274000	But, also, other homebrew stuff is available.
3274000	3281000	I'm not sure if there's any sort of limitations on what you can run on, you know, the homebrew channel
3281000	3284000	if they've got some stuff locked out for the, you know, the Wii U,
3284000	3287000	because I know there was some limitations before.
3287000	3292000	Oh, I guess one of the things that, I guess, won't work is BootMe.
3292000	3295000	But, they haven't really figured out.
3295000	3299000	They may just make a new release with BootMe support later on.
3299000	3307000	But, I don't think that was necessarily something that required for, like, you know, some of the ISO loading.
3307000	3312000	I don't know, they never did ISO loading off of the homebrew channel, so I really don't know.
3312000	3317000	But, yeah, homebrew channel 1.2 is now available.
3317000	3325000	Or, I guess, the HackMe installer 1.2 with the homebrew channel version 1.1.2.
3325000	3330000	So, that you can download off of HackMe.com.
3330000	3336000	So, Nintendo will patch this out in the next little update they do to do, because TV,
3336000	3341000	I would think TV has got to be out next week, because they announced that for December, right?
3341000	3344000	And, they're going to want to get it out before the holidays, because they're going to send,
3344000	3350000	I mean, although, yes, Nintendo's based in Japan, and it might not be the exact time off that it is here, you know?
3350000	3352000	I don't know if they can. I mean, they can keep patching.
3352000	3358000	They patch it by blocking the title ID, but then they change the title ID number for it, and then it works again.
3358000	3365000	So, I don't really know if they can block it, or if they're even going to try, because it's, you know, Wii stuff.
3365000	3371000	Do you think they'll try to get this through the main menu, as opposed to having to go into Wii and all that stuff?
3371000	3374000	Try to get Wii U homebrew channel? Is that probably a goal?
3374000	3380000	Well, originally with the homebrew channel, the way they got through it was with the GameCube emulation stuff.
3380000	3389000	So, it's possible they could do that. If they find some way to exploit it, they could possibly do, like, a Wii U homebrew channel.
3389000	3395000	Does that mean Wii U homebrew channel doesn't work on newer Wiis that don't have GameCube emulation, or is that no longer a factor?
3395000	3396000	I don't think it's a factor.
3396000	3401000	I thought the first homebrew came through Twilight Princess was some type of hack through that game.
3401000	3406000	Yeah, but that was a loader that, they ran certain, like, Dole files, or whatever, the Dolphin files.
3406000	3413000	So, I don't think, I mean, because you can run those, and you can run, there's some other type of file format that you can run as well.
3413000	3422000	So, I don't think it's necessarily going to be blocked in those that don't have that emulation anymore, because it's still, it still may load those file formats.
3422000	3428000	It just may not, you know, it just doesn't have the physical stuff to do GameCube stuff. I don't know.
3428000	3436000	So, but hypothetically, if homebrew channel's working, instead of waiting an hour for the Pikmin to move all my crap from the Wii to the Wii U,
3436000	3443000	because I have all my games backed up to hard drive on the Wii, if I get homebrew channel running, I can just run them off homebrew channel now, right?
3443000	3445000	Maybe.
3445000	3447000	Off HD loader or whatever it is, right?
3447000	3451000	You may, maybe I'll do that. I'm not really sure, because, like I said, I don't know if they have any limitations.
3451000	3459000	I didn't know, I don't know what exactly they need as far as iOS exploits, because I remember before when you're updating that stuff,
3459000	3467000	you'd have to have certain IOSes loaded in, and certain modded IOSes when they do, you know, a new update or something like that.
3467000	3476000	You'd have to patch those in order to get things to work, and since I never, see, I never really needed to do off of a hard drive,
3476000	3484000	because I had a physical mod chip in there, and so, you know, why bother doing that? You can just burn a disk.
3484000	3494000	But, I just, I don't know what you needed to do that, so I'm not sure if they can run stuff off of hard drives anymore.
3495000	3506000	You know, honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they have some sort of way to emulate the drive, like the X key, which has worked fantastically.
3506000	3513000	I don't know, because they're supposed to be doing a 3 key, which is supposed to be the PS3, and then they may have something like that for the Wii U or something,
3513000	3522000	because obviously those disks are kind of proprietary, but wasn't the Dreamcast supposed to be proprietary as well, and you can just burn the CDRs?
3522000	3528000	Yep. There was like garbage data that you'd have to sift through, but other than that.
3528000	3536000	So, I mean, you know, it may be proprietary, so maybe they'll just have some sort of drive emulator that runs to a USB drive or something,
3536000	3545000	or they'll find a way to load games onto the hard drive. I'm sure, I mean, come on, this has only been out for like a month now, so it's still very early,
3545000	3554000	and the fact that they have the homebrew channel running kind of shows that Nintendo just didn't give a shit, because they didn't really do that much to patch it out.
3554000	3559000	They could have blocked the exploit to do it, but they just didn't.
3559000	3567000	Alright, well, moving on to another story. This is about an MMO that, you know, like a lot of MMOs, it struggled a little bit,
3567000	3574000	but it managed to make a name for itself, and now it's gonna maybe get even bigger, because they're making a big change.
3574000	3581000	The Secret World, I don't know how many of you guys have checked out The Secret World, it's kind of one of the MMOs that's a little more like modern,
3581000	3585000	it's not really like a swords and sorcery type of MMO, it's more set in the modern sci-fi world.
3585000	3592000	The Secret World is going to be going what they call buy-to-play, not free-to-play, because it's not going to be completely free.
3592000	3597000	Think of the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 model, you buy the game, and now you can play it online.
3597000	3598000	I like that model, to be honest.
3598000	3601000	I think it's a great model, too. Obviously I like it, too.
3601000	3608000	But, there still will be some different tiers. There's going to be free, member, and grandmaster.
3608000	3616000	When you buy the game, you can play indefinitely, no additional fees, you can also opt to get a monthly membership that will get you some bonuses.
3616000	3624000	If you already have the grandmaster packages and you maintain your lifetime membership or whatever this is, you get additional bonuses.
3624000	3631000	XP bonuses, bonus points in-game, special monthly gift, 10% discount in the in-game store.
3631000	3635000	If you're a grandmaster, you get another 10% off in-game purchases, et cetera, et cetera.
3635000	3640000	So, definitely this model is going to lure a lot of people into checking this game out who might have written it off at first,
3640000	3645000	because, you know, who wants to pay 15 bucks a month for yet another MMO, or what have you.
3645000	3652000	There's an announcement trailer that came out for the game. The announcement trailer is called Pay Once, Play Forever.
3652000	3661000	Here's my thing, though. Not to, like, doubt Funcom or whatever, but Play Forever? Isn't that a little misleading?
3661000	3665000	Play Forever for seven years or so. Maybe.
3665000	3673000	It just makes me glad I didn't buy my lifetime membership for Star Trek Online, because, like, the very next year, free to play.
3673000	3678000	Right. Well, at least Star Trek Online is still going.
3678000	3680000	Even if they ruined it.
3681000	3686000	Come on, Final Fantasy XI. Come on. This game came out way after you did.
3686000	3690000	Come on. You've made your money already, right? Come on. Free to play.
3690000	3692000	Come on.
3692000	3694000	You have to wait and see what happens with XIV.
3694000	3698000	XIV is going to try and be subscription-based, too, so we'll see.
3698000	3699000	But anyway.
3699000	3701000	Well, it's still working, though.
3701000	3706000	I don't know what would happen if Final Fantasy XI comes by to play.
3707000	3708000	I don't know.
3708000	3712000	But back to Forever. I mean, how many games have we seen?
3712000	3714000	I like Immortal Talking Play till you're sick of us.
3714000	3717000	Well, how many games have we seen that just kind of shut down out of the blue?
3717000	3722000	Like, you know, City Heroes, I believe, just pulled the plug where they're about to.
3722000	3725000	It's right around right now that it was supposed to be ending.
3725000	3727000	That's because it was awful anyway.
3727000	3728000	Don't tell Alan you said that.
3728000	3730000	I tried to play it. I thought it was awful.
3730000	3736000	Matrix Online. What was that Richard Garriott game, the sci-fi shooter game?
3736000	3741000	Damn it. Terra something? What the hell was it called?
3741000	3742000	Terra...
3742000	3747000	I don't know. It was only around for like two years, and then they pulled the plug on it, which sucked.
3747000	3750000	I was going to say Terra Nova, but that was a show that got cancelled.
3750000	3752000	No, that was a show. Somebody in chat will say it because I can't remember.
3752000	3754000	That's a colony in Mass Effect.
3754000	3756000	Was it Rift? It wasn't...
3756000	3759000	No, Rift is still kicking, and Rift has a subscription, too, and it's doing pretty well.
3759000	3762000	I mean, it's one of those rare games that's doing very well.
3762000	3766000	A lot of the kids that are too cool for World of Warcraft go to play Rift.
3766000	3769000	At least that's the impression I get from internet forums.
3769000	3774000	So, Tabula Rasa, thank you Dungeon Buster. That was the name of it.
3774000	3776000	It's on the tip of my tongue. Tabula Rasa, thank you Dungeon Buster.
3776000	3780000	Rob, does that mean that you had a clean slate when you were trying to think of it?
3780000	3782000	That's what Tabula Rasa means.
3782000	3784000	Yes, I get it. I get it.
3784000	3786000	Yeah, well...
3787000	3789000	Fuck drumming.
3789000	3791000	Why are you yelling at chatters?
3791000	3794000	Bobby said, fuck Mass Effect, and I said, fuck drumming.
3796000	3799000	That was very random. That was Tourette's.
3799000	3802000	No, I was responding to our chatters because I pay attention to the chat room.
3802000	3804000	Oh, okay.
3804000	3806000	Let's see. Tigerclaw in chat says,
3806000	3813000	It sucks being inside an MMO and you're doing missions solo and unable to get help because nobody responds to your requests.
3814000	3816000	Kay Serocera says,
3816000	3822000	I love it, but monthly fee was something that almost made me stop playing because I can't MMO and keep my job.
3822000	3823000	Technus says,
3823000	3828000	Well, as long as they don't screw up their free-to-play model like the old Republic, they should be okay.
3831000	3832000	ImmortalKing in chat says,
3832000	3834000	Play till you're sick of us.
3835000	3836000	There you go.
3836000	3839000	Dungeon Buster, kind of giving some other background on Tabula Rasa.
3839000	3842000	Tabula Rasa went through a crazy development shift.
3842000	3847000	It started off like this weird fantasy sci-fi stuff, then it went completely extreme.
3851000	3854000	There you go, the secret world going by to play.
3854000	3858000	And I gotta be honest, it's incentive for me personally to want to check it out again.
3858000	3861000	I mean, are they still charging 60 for it? I don't think they are.
3861000	3865000	It was on sale for like 30 at one point, so I'll have to see.
3865000	3867000	Especially with the Steam sale coming up.
3868000	3871000	Steam sales coming, brace yourselves.
3872000	3873000	Where's our picture?
3873000	3874000	I'm not ready.
3874000	3879000	Where's our picture of who's that guy? Is that Viggo Mortensen from one of those Game of Thrones or one of those shows?
3879000	3880000	Brace yourselves.
3881000	3882000	Steam sales coming.
3882000	3883000	Lord.
3884000	3886000	Alright, Dark Soccer, you got another story for us.
3888000	3889000	You've broken my brain, Rob.
3891000	3894000	How about, well, here's a game I think that we're all a fan of it.
3894000	3895000	Ghosts and Goblins, right?
3897000	3898000	Yeah, I like Ghosts and Goblins.
3898000	3899000	I'm aware of it.
3900000	3901000	No taste.
3901000	3911000	Anyway, there is a spiritual successor that actually has been put out by a Spanish developer called Loco Melito, I think.
3911000	3920000	They did a game called Matilda Castilla, which is pretty much like playing Ghosts and Goblins.
3920000	3922000	Except it's not Ghosts and Goblins and it's free.
3922000	3932000	So you can actually, it's got influences like from Shinobi, a few other things, and they're Karnov Trojan, different things that are thrown in.
3932000	3938000	But it's basically just as masochistic as playing the Ghosts and Goblins series, or Makaimura.
3938000	3943000	So I watched the trailer and actually I kind of think I won it.
3943000	3948000	So you can actually get the game on the game's site.
3949000	3957000	Just go to Locomalito.com and you can get it for free.
3960000	3963000	And of course you're a Ghosts and Goblins fan, so this doesn't surprise me at all.
3963000	3965000	This is something you might want.
3969000	3973000	Do you think you would still be able to tolerate the nauseatingly difficult difficulty of these games?
3973000	3974000	Good lord.
3974000	3981000	Good lord. Well, we were actually, Dan was showing me a version of it that I want to say it was the Sharp version.
3981000	3984000	Did they do a version of that for the Sharp computer?
3984000	3990000	We were watching the Super Graphics version, which I told Dan right then and there I wanted a Super Graphics.
3990000	3995000	Where it has all the animation and everything and it does the charge and all that.
3995000	4000000	I was like, I want a Super Graphics just to play Ghosts and Goblins.
4001000	4005000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4005000	4011000	Figure out some games that are coming to a console near you, or even PC maybe. Loki?
4011000	4018000	There's not a whole lot this week. It's pretty much just Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Vita.
4020000	4024000	Which clearly must have been delayed from the rest of it.
4024000	4028000	Yeah, and even the 3DS version's not coming out until next year.
4028000	4029000	Weird.
4029000	4035000	Yeah, it's kind of disappointing. That is literally it.
4035000	4038000	Well, the holiday games have to be out by now.
4038000	4041000	Yeah, the next few weeks are going to be nothing.
4042000	4049000	Alright, there's some stuff going on in Japan. It's a little different in Japan, so there's some games still coming out this week.
4049000	4055000	Call of Duty Black Ops 2 on the Xbox 360 Dubbed Edition makes its way out on December 20th.
4055000	4058000	Do you know who publishes it in Japan? Call of Duty Black Ops 2?
4059000	4060000	Somebody.
4060000	4064000	It's not Activision. In Japan. It's not who you'd expect.
4064000	4065000	Take Two?
4065000	4066000	Square Enix.
4066000	4067000	Square Enix.
4067000	4070000	That actually doesn't surprise me. Square Enix does a lot of localization.
4070000	4074000	Well, yeah, that and now that they have the Eidos part of it too.
4074000	4078000	We've seen some very different games coming out of that company, so I just thought it was interesting.
4078000	4084000	But anyway, also Shin-Hokuto Musou. That's a regular and treasure box edition.
4084000	4087000	And there's all these Xbox Live cards coming out around this too.
4087000	4091000	I believe this is a Fist of the North Star game.
4091000	4093000	Is it Hokuto no Ken?
4093000	4097000	It's a reimagination of Hokuto Musou.
4097000	4099000	It's probably Fist of the North Star 2.
4099000	4101000	Yeah, I can tell by the logo.
4101000	4103000	It's Fist of the North Star Ken's Rage 2.
4103000	4107000	Yeah, that's exactly what it is. That is exactly what it is based off the little YouTube trailer.
4107000	4108000	Oh yeah, totally.
4108000	4110000	Totally. You can see from the screenshots, that's what it is.
4110000	4111000	Extra Blood?
4111000	4112000	Yes.
4112000	4113000	That's coming out over here in February.
4113000	4114000	Oh, okay. There you go.
4114000	4119000	That game also coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4119000	4124000	Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box. Remember that box with like everything Final Fantasy in it?
4124000	4126000	That's out in Japan this week.
4126000	4131000	Catherine gets a price reduction. Call of Duty dubbed edition is on the PlayStation 3 as well.
4131000	4134000	There's a whole PlayStation 3 console around Shin-Hokuto Musou.
4134000	4137000	So obviously the Fist of the North Star stuff is big over there.
4137000	4139000	Much bigger than I give it credit for.
4139000	4148000	Also in regular and luxury limited editions this week, Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka o Kirisaku Hikari Tokage comes out.
4148000	4157000	This is not a series I recognize. It looks a little tactical with anime chicks.
4157000	4160000	That could have been like every Japanese game ever.
4160000	4164000	But anyway, that is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4165000	4174000	Going to the PlayStation Vita, AKB1 149 Renai Sosenkyou comes out from Bandai Namco this week.
4174000	4177000	Also in regular and limited box editions.
4177000	4180000	Let's see, looking at the...
4180000	4185000	That was the Vita. Let me look at the Wii U now that that is out in Japan.
4185000	4191000	Sports Connection and the Family Party or Simple Series for Wii U Volume 1.
4191000	4196000	I'm sure that is their equivalent of, what the hell is that called over here, 30 party games?
4196000	4199000	Yeah, it's a family party.
4199000	4203000	The most hilarious Miiverse board you will find on the entire system.
4205000	4208000	That's the one I made you read last week, remember? Good times.
4208000	4213000	On the Nintendo 3DS this week, Tongari Bushi to Mahonomachi comes out.
4213000	4219000	As well as Osare de Koi Konyo to Asobo Umihen comes out as well.
4219000	4222000	I have no idea what any of these games are.
4222000	4224000	Osare de Koi...
4224000	4227000	Osare de Koi Koi...
4227000	4228000	It's a puppy game.
4228000	4229000	Oh, it's puppies.
4229000	4230000	It's a puppy.
4230000	4232000	Oh, it's adorable. Puppies wearing sunglasses.
4232000	4234000	The moment I saw Koi, I was like, that means puppy.
4234000	4236000	I'm sure it's shovelware, let's be real.
4236000	4239000	I think it's like playing games with puppies.
4241000	4242000	It's adorable.
4242000	4244000	It had Asobi in the title, didn't it?
4244000	4246000	Who doesn't want to play games with puppies?
4246000	4247000	It's like playing games with puppies.
4247000	4248000	Who doesn't want to play games with puppies?
4248000	4250000	Best title for a game ever, playing games with puppies.
4252000	4254000	I like playing games with puppies.
4255000	4260000	I would say they should localize that and put that out here, but let's be real, those puppy and kitty games are a dime a dozen.
4260000	4263000	Would you buy a game that was called playing games with puppies?
4263000	4265000	If it had a Corgi on the cover, maybe.
4265000	4266000	Hell yeah.
4267000	4271000	Alright, let's do a couple more news stories in the classic game of the week. Loki.
4271000	4282000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about kind of what we talked about last week with some servers going down for Sniper Elite and Neverwinter Nights.
4282000	4287000	And of course, there was a whole thing with Gamespy.
4287000	4289000	Why are they taking this stuff down?
4289000	4299000	Because they're saying that, oh, I guess it's just the company's rebellion is taking it down because they just don't want to continue with it.
4299000	4301000	Well, that's not true.
4301000	4307000	Glue Mobile, since they were the ones that bought Gamespy, apparently they've upped the rates.
4307000	4320000	And they've basically said, and not even really in a polite manner, they've basically said, well, they decided to discontinue service with us because they're not paying their fees.
4320000	4326000	But what they forgot to mention is we raised our fees quite a bit more than what they were before.
4327000	4335000	So that's why these games are no longer on their sites because Glue is trying to charge too much for the middleware that they're using.
4336000	4337000	Ouch.
4338000	4345000	Well, they gotta be careful because they're not the only company out there that does this stuff.
4345000	4350000	So if you're gonna be assholes about it, I hear Steam's pretty good.
4350000	4357000	Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
4357000	4362000	And this is about a game called Oculus Rift, which is...
4362000	4363000	It's a peripheral.
4363000	4364000	Oh, okay.
4364000	4366000	Did I do my games?
4366000	4369000	You don't have anything in... Oh, you didn't do your releases, did you?
4369000	4370000	No, I didn't.
4370000	4371000	Oh, my bad.
4371000	4373000	I've been waiting, and I was like, jeez, Rob.
4373000	4378000	Well, we were too busy being occupied with cute puppy games.
4378000	4379000	Well, then do your release dates.
4379000	4380000	Okay.
4380000	4385000	In the UK, on December 17th is Street Fighter X Mega Man on PC.
4385000	4388000	December 18th is Escape Vector with a K.
4388000	4392000	December 19th is Escape Vector with a K on the 3DS.
4392000	4395000	And the 21st, Fuel Overdose and Vectropolis.
4395000	4397000	There, Rob.
4398000	4401000	I wonder if Fuel Overdose is like a sequel to Fuel.
4401000	4402000	That would've been awesome.
4402000	4403000	Huh.
4403000	4404000	I don't think it is.
4404000	4405000	I doubt it.
4405000	4409000	Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset.
4409000	4413000	This group in Irvine that's a startup called Sinful Robot,
4413000	4415000	they are looking at this device to do, quote,
4415000	4420000	the world's first series of fully immersive erotic encounters.
4420000	4421000	Oh, right.
4421000	4423000	Hell, yes.
4423000	4428000	Apparently, they're posting for different 3D artists and animators.
4428000	4430000	I guess, of course, news about this hit Reddit,
4430000	4433000	and Sinful Robot actually got the thread and said,
4433000	4435000	thanks to the device, quote,
4435000	4439000	we can finally make an erotic adventure game that will actually be exciting.
4440000	4441000	Oh, right.
4442000	4444000	It'll be in 3D.
4444000	4445000	That's right.
4445000	4446000	Virtual reality.
4446000	4450000	Those tits will be in 3D and it's just anywhere you look.
4450000	4452000	Titties, titties, titties, titties.
4452000	4453000	All around you.
4453000	4455000	Dark Sakura just looked down.
4455000	4457000	I wish it was a TV show.
4458000	4459000	All right.
4460000	4461000	Wanna sell systems?
4461000	4462000	Just add porn.
4462000	4463000	Just add porn.
4463000	4464000	That's the secret.
4464000	4465000	All right.
4465000	4466000	Let's go to a time,
4466000	4469000	let's go to a time when games were a little simpler.
4469000	4471000	Much simpler.
4471000	4474000	Erotic games were bubble bath babes.
4474000	4476000	That was your erotic game.
4479000	4481000	Per Custer's Revenge.
4481000	4482000	Acidic Vampire in Chat says,
4482000	4484000	how about fucking someone in real life?
4484000	4485000	You can't beat that.
4485000	4486000	They will try.
4486000	4488000	Some people can't do that.
4489000	4490000	You know what?
4490000	4492000	That's why there's toys.
4492000	4493000	All right.
4493000	4496000	Moving on to the classic game of the week,
4496000	4497000	Dark Sakura.
4497000	4498000	Going into the vault,
4498000	4499000	picking out a game that she thinks,
4499000	4501000	hey, you kids should play this game.
4501000	4503000	And because it's episode 486,
4503000	4505000	you remembered to pick a PC game, right?
4507000	4508000	Oops.
4508000	4509000	Oops.
4509000	4510000	It's all right.
4510000	4511000	That's okay, I picked something
4511000	4512000	that I brought up a bajillion times before
4512000	4514000	but actually never covered.
4514000	4516000	Then what is the classic game of the week?
4516000	4517000	Panorama Cotton.
4517000	4519000	Yay.
4521000	4523000	Panorama Cotton is,
4523000	4525000	I'm sure other people have heard of cotton
4525000	4527000	since I've brought up the cotton series
4527000	4528000	a bunch of times.
4528000	4530000	The original cotton series are like
4530000	4531000	side-scrolling shooters.
4531000	4534000	This one actually plays closer to Space Harrier.
4534000	4538000	And it was put out on the Genesis slash Mega Drive
4538000	4542000	in 1994 only in Japan by success.
4542000	4544000	And on top of that,
4544000	4546000	it's supremely rare.
4546000	4549000	They did like 600 copies of the damn game.
4550000	4551000	You really...
4551000	4554000	Now, I have actually seen a copy
4554000	4555000	and have actually held a copy
4555000	4557000	because a friend of mine owns a copy of this.
4557000	4558000	However, she lives in...
4558000	4559000	You're special.
4559000	4560000	Yes.
4560000	4562000	However, she lives in Nagoya right now, so...
4564000	4566000	So cotton is...
4568000	4570000	Well, it's just a very interesting little game.
4570000	4572000	I mean, you basically fly around
4572000	4574000	with the cameras behind you and you shoot stuff.
4574000	4577000	And then you have the crazy little witch named Cotton.
4577000	4579000	So if you want to go into the story about this,
4581000	4585000	Cotton runs into this little fairy's...
4585000	4587000	Her fairy partner is Silk,
4587000	4589000	but she runs into one named Nit,
4589000	4592000	who tells her that the queen is starting to make...
4592000	4594000	Say things that don't make sense.
4594000	4597000	So she goes off to see what happens
4597000	4599000	and doesn't come back.
4599000	4603000	So Silk and Nit start pulling this willow,
4603000	4606000	which is this candy stuff that Cotton is super addicted to,
4606000	4609000	and she eats it and then she throws up and it's hilarious.
4609000	4611000	But Cotton sees the burnt piece of willow
4611000	4612000	and eats it anyway,
4612000	4614000	and then says that she's really pissed off
4614000	4616000	that people have, you know, burned the willow.
4616000	4618000	So now she's going after to save the day
4618000	4620000	all for purely selfish reasons.
4620000	4623000	So, I mean, you basically...
4623000	4625000	You're flying around on your little broom shooting stuff
4625000	4627000	and you're getting these little balls
4627000	4629000	that give you power-ups and points.
4629000	4631000	And it's just super cute.
4631000	4633000	Like, the part that Rob's looking at right now,
4633000	4635000	you're flying over a rainbow stream
4635000	4637000	in the middle of a desert,
4637000	4639000	and it's just super cute.
4639000	4642000	You know, the game that was one of the very first games
4642000	4645000	I ever brought up for Classic Game
4645000	4647000	was Panorama Cotton.
4647000	4651000	It was the direct-style sequel to Panorama Cotton,
4651000	4654000	which you can't get in the U.S.
4654000	4656000	But it is super fun.
4656000	4657000	Just go play it.
4657000	4660000	It's like Space Harrier but, like, totally cute.
4660000	4664000	And if you have $300 to $500, you can own your own copy.
4664000	4667000	Words can't express the giant lady boner you have for this series.
4667000	4669000	I love cotton.
4669000	4672000	I mean, it's just so on crack.
4672000	4676000	And, I mean, seriously, if I could afford this cartridge,
4676000	4677000	I would so buy it.
4677000	4679000	I would have it in a second.
4679000	4682000	I will tell people that are looking to emulate it,
4682000	4685000	there are some Genesis emulators that will not run this game
4685000	4688000	because it was fairly complicated, like I said,
4688000	4690000	and they do marry many copies.
4690000	4693000	However, you can find ROM dumps of it
4693000	4698000	and I think that Gens is the emulator that I used to use to play it.
4698000	4701000	So, good luck.
4701000	4705000	Oh, by the way, I think there are repro cartridges of this
4705000	4708000	that you can order that will work on U.S. Genesis.
4708000	4710000	Well, then there you go.
4710000	4711000	I'll see if I can find it.
4711000	4715000	Your Classic Game of the Week, Panorama Cotton for the Genesis.
4715000	4717000	Good luck finding a copy,
4717000	4719000	but it sounds like you can at least do emulators.
4719000	4720000	I'm checking eBay real quick.
4720000	4722000	You kids can experience it.
4724000	4727000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
4727000	4731000	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, wave.
4731000	4733000	All right, we're going to take a break.
4733000	4735000	When we come back, though, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4735000	4738000	Your emails, the Fugu question of the week, your calls,
4738000	4743000	some more stories like the Grammy-nominated Journey Composer.
4743000	4745000	You won't believe what game series he's doing next.
4745000	4748000	We're going to talk about that, as well as some rapid-fire news.
4748000	4749000	What?
4749000	4751000	118 bucks right now.
4751000	4752000	That's less than you said earlier.
4752000	4753000	With the buy it now.
4754000	4757000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, stay tuned, everybody.
4763000	4766000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4766000	4770000	We are live on this December the 16th of 2012
4770000	4774000	with the 486th episode of our show.
4774000	4776000	That's right, 486.
4776000	4779000	Since Dark Sakura neglected to do the PC connection,
4779000	4782000	I'll ask Loki, what's a favorite game of yours, you remember,
4782000	4785000	from the 486 days on the PC?
4785000	4788000	What was a game that you remember loving on the 486?
4788000	4794000	I would say even on the 486, I was still playing Castle Wolfenstein.
4794000	4795000	Yeah.
4795000	4799000	I don't think I had a 486. I had a 386.
4799000	4802000	My friend had a 486, and he had played Doom.
4802000	4806000	I'd say also maybe Command & Conquer Red Alert, the first one.
4807000	4809000	What else did we play?
4809000	4811000	Well, no, I did have a 486, actually.
4811000	4814000	My first computer was a 386 SX16,
4814000	4817000	and then the next computer was a 486, I think 100 or something,
4817000	4819000	was the speed of those things.
4819000	4822000	And then after that was finally the Pentium,
4822000	4824000	but I had the 486 for a while.
4824000	4827000	That was probably my Civilization I days.
4827000	4829000	Loved Civ I.
4829000	4831000	I was a Sid Meier fanboy in general,
4831000	4834000	because like Covert Action, Railroad,
4834000	4836000	Tycoon Deluxe, I loved all those games.
4836000	4838000	Colonization, all of them.
4838000	4841000	Dark Soccer, did you have PC games that you played back then?
4841000	4843000	You've kind of always been more console, haven't you?
4843000	4845000	Yeah, I've always been more console.
4845000	4846000	Until now.
4846000	4847000	Well, yeah.
4847000	4851000	But on my friends, I actually was really into Doom.
4851000	4854000	I was really into Hexen, really into Hexen.
4854000	4856000	Oh, yeah, Hexen was badass.
4856000	4859000	And Descent, because I told you about my friend's rig,
4859000	4862000	where he had it set up with a chair to play Descent.
4863000	4865000	Crap, that was another game.
4865000	4869000	Oh, my friend and I would actually go through Phantasmagoria,
4869000	4872000	which I think I've reviewed Phantasmagoria on the show before.
4872000	4874000	Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.
4874000	4877000	Seven CDs full of awesomeness.
4877000	4880000	And what was the other game?
4880000	4882000	Probably Gabriel Knight.
4882000	4884000	No, I wasn't really into Gabriel Knight.
4884000	4886000	Jazz Jackrabbit.
4886000	4888000	Jill of the Jungle.
4888000	4890000	Good job.
4890000	4892000	Jill of the Jungle. Good times.
4892000	4893000	No, just Jazz Jackrabbit.
4893000	4896000	I remember when Commander Keen 4 came out,
4896000	4899000	everybody lost their shit because it was like Commander Keen Mario style.
4899000	4901000	Like, the first Commander Keen was not so,
4901000	4904000	but, like, Commander Keen 4 was like, oh, my God, it's like Mario.
4904000	4906000	All that stuff was awesome.
4906000	4910000	Speaking of those games, you know, not to give free commercials to a website,
4910000	4912000	but you know what, they're doing a pretty awesome thing.
4912000	4915000	GOG.com, if you visit the site that sells, like, the old games.
4915000	4918000	I don't know if it's still going on, maybe the chatters can check,
4918000	4920000	but they were giving away Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition.
4920000	4921000	It's over.
4921000	4922000	Oh, it's over?
4922000	4923000	Yeah, it's over.
4923000	4924000	Did you say Hanukkah Edition?
4924000	4925000	No, Atomic Edition.
4925000	4926000	I was like, what?
4926000	4928000	They were giving it away for Hanukkah, apparently,
4928000	4930000	because it was about those same days, but.
4930000	4937000	It was, um, I want to say it was only through the 18th, maybe?
4937000	4939000	Or maybe it's done.
4939000	4942000	I can't remember if it was, let's see here.
4942000	4946000	But, um, they have a lot of old games that I remember from that era that are,
4946000	4949000	because I was actually looking into Populous the other day,
4949000	4951000	because somebody brought up Peter Molyneux,
4951000	4954000	and I was thinking about the other games he'd done,
4954000	4955000	like Black and White and stuff, and I was like,
4955000	4958000	oh, Populous was an awesome game.
4958000	4959000	I remember my other big game.
4959000	4960000	What's that?
4960000	4961000	Loom.
4961000	4962000	Oh, yes.
4962000	4963000	Good stuff.
4963000	4965000	I freaking loved Loom.
4965000	4967000	I played through that game so many times.
4967000	4969000	And you remember when it came out on Steam?
4969000	4970000	Guess who had it?
4970000	4973000	Actually, I had bought a PC copy CD before,
4973000	4975000	and then it came out on Steam.
4975000	4977000	Yeah, Loom's a great choice. Good stuff.
4977000	4978000	All right.
4978000	4980000	Yeah, I think it's over.
4980000	4985000	It looks like ActDeft is confirming Duke Nukem was free till Thursday,
4985000	4987000	and Porkchop says the offer is over.
4987000	4988000	It was pretty cool, though.
4988000	4990000	That is all from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
4990000	4991000	I did pick it up, though.
4991000	4993000	You know, that was the first LAN game I ever played was Duke Nukem 3D.
4993000	5000000	I used to call into a BBS to play, actually, I think it was Doom 2.
5000000	5003000	You would call the BBS and you could do, like, games,
5003000	5007000	and then they'd want to charge you for each minute on the first 30 or something.
5007000	5012000	Duke Nukem 3D was a game that I played a lot on on my Pentium, I think.
5012000	5017000	I used to work Mobicon for a couple of years,
5017000	5019000	and we had a big setup with Duke Nukem 3D.
5019000	5021000	You could also do your voice macros,
5021000	5023000	so we could put in your face, your ass, what's the difference,
5023000	5025000	and all of the ones that we liked.
5025000	5027000	I know I've told this story on OLR before,
5027000	5031000	but it's been a while, and since it's 486, I'll tell it again.
5031000	5034000	When I was living in a college dorm, I went to California State University, Chico,
5034000	5036000	and I lived in the dorms there. Oh, God.
5036000	5039000	But one of the cool things about being in the dorms
5039000	5042000	was my best friend in the dorms lived next door to me,
5042000	5045000	and he was also kind of a computer nerd, and I was too.
5045000	5049000	It's like you're living in these tiny little rooms, right?
5049000	5051000	But everybody had their own phone line,
5051000	5054000	so we would use the phone lines to connect Duke Nukem,
5054000	5057000	and so I'd be playing in my room, he'd be playing in his room,
5057000	5061000	we'd have the doors open, yelling at each other on like a Friday night or whatever,
5061000	5063000	and all the other guys would be like, what the fuck are those nerds up to?
5063000	5066000	And so they'd walk into the room, and they'd be like, oh,
5066000	5069000	and so what they'd do, they'd go into one room,
5069000	5071000	and then they'd see where we're at and then come in the other room
5071000	5074000	and tell one of us like, oh, you got to go get him, he's over there or whatever.
5074000	5076000	So those were some fun nights.
5076000	5080000	Actually, as much of a nerd as I was and picked on for that,
5080000	5085000	I was very popular because I had the only Super Nintendo with Mario Kart,
5085000	5088000	and those guys always wanted to come over and play Mario Kart.
5088000	5090000	See, that's why my dorm room was popular.
5090000	5093000	Our dorms were more set up like as small different apartments,
5093000	5097000	it wasn't like the dorm building, it was just a set of buildings,
5097000	5101000	and I had my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation over,
5101000	5103000	so I had a PlayStation and a Super Nintendo,
5103000	5106000	and a VCR where I could record Runin' Warriors,
5106000	5109000	because I was totally freaking into that show when I was first in college,
5109000	5111000	and Sailor Moon.
5111000	5114000	So they would come over to my room to watch all the anime,
5114000	5117000	because also my friend, who was the same one that built the descent chair,
5117000	5120000	would just copy me all kinds of fun stuff,
5120000	5124000	and we would do our own personal dub to Uratsukidoji,
5124000	5127000	the Legend of the Overfiend, technical porn.
5127000	5129000	Oh yes, yes, I know Uratsukidoji.
5129000	5132000	And then play Toshinden all night. It was epic.
5132000	5136000	BlackWolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
5136000	5138000	I was popular because of Mario Kart 64.
5138000	5141000	See, I didn't get a Nintendo 64 right away,
5141000	5144000	but the people that lived right above me did,
5144000	5148000	and they got one right, because it was like the holidays that year
5148000	5151000	that I was a freshman in the dorms that that system came out.
5151000	5153000	They got one right away,
5153000	5156000	and you better believe they were the popular kids when they got that.
5156000	5160000	I mean, even I was up there as much as possible playing,
5160000	5164000	I guess it was Mario 64, because Mario Kart wasn't a release title.
5164000	5167000	Maybe it was a year after. I can't remember now.
5167000	5170000	It's been a while, because I thought they had Mario Kart,
5170000	5173000	but maybe that was like the next semester or something like that.
5173000	5176000	I can't remember. My memory's fading.
5176000	5179000	But yeah, they definitely had a Nintendo 64 upstairs,
5179000	5181000	and at the time it was like,
5181000	5185000	dude, the graphics in this are so good.
5185000	5188000	And then I got a PlayStation like the next year,
5188000	5191000	and I missed an unhealthy amount of class
5191000	5196000	thanks to Final Fantasy VII and Super Puzzle Fighter II.
5196000	5199000	Fuck that game, seriously.
5199000	5203000	All right. Yeah, Black Wolf says the N64 came out at Christmas,
5203000	5205000	but Mario Kart didn't come out until right around spring break,
5205000	5207000	so it was kind of close. They got the system at Christmas,
5207000	5210000	and then I remembered, like, I thought I played Mario Kart up there.
5210000	5213000	They must have got it the second semester before the end of the year.
5213000	5215000	Good times. All right.
5215000	5220000	Let's move on and get back into some gaming news with some rapid-fire news.
5220000	5221000	Loki.
5221000	5225000	All right. So, Minecraft, of course, has sold a lot of copies,
5225000	5228000	and five million of those now are the Pocket Edition,
5228000	5234000	and, of course, the franchise is now up to 17.5 million copies,
5234000	5238000	and I'm sure a lot of those are the Xbox Live Arcade version as well.
5238000	5244000	And right now they are up to, I guess, the next update's going to be 0.51.
5244000	5247000	Wait, I thought Pocket Edition was specifically the phones.
5247000	5249000	They consider Xbox Live Pocket Edition?
5249000	5251000	No, I'm saying the total sales are 17.5.
5251000	5253000	Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
5253000	5257000	So I bet a bunch of that is the Xbox Live Arcade version.
5257000	5262000	No. So, anyways, the phone version or iOS version or whatever,
5262000	5266000	Pocket Edition's going to be receiving an update soon that's 0.51,
5266000	5270000	and I guess that's going to include online multiplayer.
5270000	5273000	So right now you can play, but it has to be on local Wi-Fi
5273000	5274000	and not through the Internet.
5274000	5278000	So that would be kind of cool that you can be able to play worlds
5278000	5280000	through the Pocket Edition.
5280000	5283000	It's probably a good thing, though, that it doesn't work with our current servers
5283000	5288000	because, I don't know, that might be bad.
5288000	5290000	One of the things I forgot to mention was at my game week,
5290000	5293000	they had a thing this week they were giving away.
5293000	5297000	It's this company PowerA, and they have these controllers called MOGAs.
5297000	5301000	Basically it's a Bluetooth controller that you can snap your phone into
5301000	5304000	and play games on.
5304000	5307000	And they were giving away with, what was it, Modern Combat 4,
5307000	5310000	that new Gameloft game.
5311000	5316000	I don't know, it looks cool, but the thing I'm hoping to be able to use with it
5316000	5322000	is because they had the Pocket Edition worked with the PlayStation,
5322000	5325000	Mobile Suite stuff, and the Xperia Play.
5325000	5330000	So it would be nice to be able to control that kind of like you can on the 360
5330000	5332000	with the Bluetooth controller.
5332000	5333000	I hope that's the case.
5333000	5337000	Anyways, Retro City Rampage, a game that's pretty awesome
5337000	5339000	on the Vita and PlayStation Network.
5339000	5343000	It's supposed to be coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade and WiiWare services,
5343000	5347000	and it's been a while since this was released.
5347000	5349000	It originally came out in the beginning of October,
5349000	5351000	and that was also on PC as well.
5351000	5358000	And now it's actually in certification for Xbox Live Arcade and WiiWare.
5358000	5361000	So probably in the next few weeks, I'd say by the end of the year,
5361000	5364000	you're going to see a release for this, which is pretty awesome.
5364000	5368000	So definitely worth checking out if you've got those systems.
5369000	5371000	And last but not least, I don't know if I should be scared about this.
5371000	5374000	Thankfully, it's not for quite a few years.
5374000	5377000	But the Angry Birds movie is moving forward.
5377000	5381000	Now they've got some people attached to it,
5381000	5385000	including I guess the producer, John Cohen, has signed on.
5385000	5388000	He's the guy that did Despicable Me.
5388000	5394000	And also David Massell, who did, I guess, producing on Iron Man.
5394000	5398000	And I don't know.
5398000	5403000	The movie's not supposed to be out until summer of 2016,
5403000	5408000	which hopefully Angry Birds is still a thing by then,
5408000	5416000	because these franchises sometimes kind of disappear in a few years.
5416000	5419000	You know, I wish I could say I cared about the Angry Birds movie,
5419000	5421000	but I don't.
5421000	5423000	I have no fucking clue what the hell it would be about.
5423000	5425000	Could be a bunch of birds exploding on impact.
5425000	5429000	I especially give no shits about the Angry Birds movie
5429000	5431000	now that they've confirmed Tron 3.
5431000	5433000	So you know what?
5433000	5434000	Totally.
5434000	5436000	That's the only gaming movie I need in my life.
5436000	5438000	Well, let me put it this way.
5438000	5441000	There's probably going to be a plethora of fantastic movies coming out,
5441000	5443000	especially gaming-related.
5443000	5446000	I mean, Tron 3, for one, is going to be fantastic.
5446000	5449000	Sort of gaming, but not quite.
5449000	5451000	Ender's Game next year.
5451000	5453000	Yeah, but that's more known for the book.
5453000	5455000	But it's Ender's Game. It's awesome.
5455000	5456000	So it'll be cool.
5456000	5461000	And I hope that God, by 2016, Ready Player One Bear fucking be a movie,
5461000	5463000	because they've already sold the movie rights to it.
5463000	5465000	It better be a fucking movie by then.
5465000	5469000	As much as Bobby doesn't want me to keep bringing this up on the network,
5469000	5473000	Mass Effect is going to be a movie from Legendary Pictures.
5473000	5474000	But here's the thing.
5474000	5476000	Here's what will make it worth it,
5476000	5479000	because all the fanboys and fangirls are going to rage,
5479000	5481000	because it's not going to be done right.
5481000	5484000	You know they're going to fuck up that movie,
5484000	5490000	because let's say if they cast a man to play Shepard in the Mass Effect movie,
5490000	5492000	there's going to be all these people that are like,
5492000	5493000	Fem Shepard, get the fuck out.
5493000	5495000	This movie isn't canon. Fuck it.
5495000	5499000	Which, to some extent, as much as I enjoy Mass Effect
5499000	5503000	when I play as male Shepard, so I can have my gay time with Caden,
5503000	5507000	if they did a movie around Fem Shep, I would not complain.
5507000	5509000	I really think they do need to do the movie as Fem Shep.
5509000	5514000	I'm trying to think of the worst person they could cast for Shepard in that movie.
5514000	5515000	Oh, The Rock?
5515000	5517000	No, no, no.
5517000	5519000	You've got to be thinking worse than that.
5519000	5521000	Freddie Prinze Jr., how about that?
5521000	5523000	That's because he's Vega.
5523000	5526000	Yeah, I wouldn't want him playing Vega, though.
5526000	5530000	No, but I honestly would love to see them just do a CG movie
5530000	5532000	and have the same voice.
5532000	5536000	Because honestly, to quote a mutual friend of mine in Becky's,
5536000	5539000	Mass Effect is the best movie I've ever played.
5539000	5541000	Rob Schneider as...
5543000	5546000	Alright, enough of that Angry Birds.
5546000	5549000	But seriously though, I don't understand how there's no story to the game.
5549000	5552000	That's like making Tetris the movie, it doesn't make any sense.
5552000	5555000	At least when you try to do Super Mario Bros. movie,
5555000	5557000	there's a general plot.
5557000	5560000	Angry Birds is like, these pigs are bad, and they blow up.
5560000	5565000	It's a puzzle game, you can't make a fucking movie out of a puzzle game.
5565000	5569000	I understand that you think that you can because you want to have money,
5569000	5571000	but there's just...
5571000	5573000	I don't know.
5573000	5576000	What about, what would be a reasonable actress,
5576000	5579000	like one that would not cost millions of dollars that could be fem-shep?
5579000	5582000	I think the girl with the dragon tattoo.
5582000	5585000	What's her name? Numi Rapace or something like that?
5585000	5586000	I don't know.
5586000	5587000	Could be it.
5587000	5589000	Because, you know, I don't know.
5589000	5591000	Then there's that part that's like, oh, Scarlett Johansson.
5591000	5593000	But I don't know, I can't see it.
5593000	5595000	Honestly, no, no, no, no, no.
5595000	5600000	The one who played Maria Hill, because there's actually a Photoshop thing out there,
5600000	5604000	where they put her in the armor and everything as female Shepard,
5604000	5606000	and she looked the part.
5606000	5607000	She was perfect.
5607000	5609000	Wendy Williams as.
5609000	5611000	Hold on, let me look up who she was.
5611000	5613000	And I'm talking about the Avengers movie.
5617000	5619000	Alright, moving on.
5619000	5622000	I'm gonna try to find out who it was that played her.
5622000	5626000	Some folks in chat talking about Nathan Fillion as the Uncharted.
5627000	5628000	That's what Black Wolf said.
5628000	5630000	Nathan Fillion needs to do the Uncharted movie first.
5630000	5632000	Nathan Fillion as Garrus.
5632000	5633000	No, I'm kidding.
5633000	5634000	Anyhow.
5634000	5635000	Okay.
5636000	5637000	Coby Smulders.
5639000	5641000	Black Wolf says, how about Jennifer Hale as fem-shep?
5641000	5642000	Here's the thing.
5642000	5643000	She's a voice actress.
5643000	5645000	She's not like, there's a big difference between,
5645000	5646000	I mean, she's a great voice actress,
5646000	5650000	but I don't know what her experience is with like stage and movie acting.
5650000	5652000	If she's got the chops, then sure.
5652000	5653000	Why not?
5653000	5655000	But I'm all for heavy.
5655000	5657000	I think she's also a little, I hate to say it,
5657000	5659000	she's kind of old for the part.
5659000	5660000	I think.
5660000	5663000	Well, Shepard is supposed to be 32.
5663000	5664000	Not in the first game.
5664000	5668000	If you look in, if you look in the timeline for the first game, she's 30.
5668000	5670000	Oh, I thought she was 28 in the first game.
5670000	5672000	She's supposed to be 32 by Mass Effect 3.
5672000	5676000	They totally need to do a heavy rain movie with, you know,
5676000	5678000	voice acting and intact, you know.
5678000	5679000	Jason!
5679000	5680000	Jason!
5680000	5682000	I can see them doing a heavy rain movie.
5682000	5686000	Now the guy who does Garris' voice acting is totally goofy looking.
5686000	5689000	Like I brought him up from the episode Buffy.
5689000	5695000	However, they should, you know, have a general actor and have him do the voice.
5695000	5697000	And then I will be happy.
5697000	5698000	All right, moving on.
5698000	5699000	Let's get away from movie talk.
5699000	5701000	Let's talk about retro games.
5701000	5702000	Penn and Teller is sovereign.
5702000	5703000	Stop.
5703000	5704000	Stop.
5704000	5705000	All right.
5705000	5707000	Getting into retro games.
5707000	5712000	Capcom Arcade Cabinet is something that's rumored for the 3DS and the Wii U eShop.
5712000	5714000	No idea what the hell that is.
5714000	5717000	It's probably just repackaging the same old stuff to try and sell it over again,
5717000	5720000	just like they're doing on the iOS and, you know.
5720000	5725000	There was a Capcom arcade collection on PlayStation Portable, right,
5725000	5726000	that had a bunch of stuff.
5726000	5728000	So it's probably just a rehashing of this.
5728000	5733000	So I would say that would be great as long as it has Magic Sword,
5733000	5736000	but we already did have that Magic Sword reimagining, which was pretty awesome.
5736000	5745000	So I say, Capcom Arcade Cabinet, I want Quiz and Dragons in all its 1992 trivia glory.
5745000	5746000	Thank you very much.
5746000	5751000	Quiz and Dragons for Capcom Arcade Cabinet, please.
5751000	5755000	Xbox Live is getting some new apps.
5755000	5758000	SkyDrive, CNET, Maxim, Karaoke.
5758000	5761000	They actually just added them this week.
5761000	5762000	That's pretty cool.
5762000	5768000	They're not out in every countries, but they're out in the U.S. at least,
5768000	5771000	and I think Canada got Maxim and CNET.
5771000	5773000	No, Canada just got CNET.
5773000	5777000	And Karaoke and SkyDrive are going out worldwide,
5777000	5781000	except Japan and United Arab Emirates for Karaoke.
5781000	5784000	I imagine that Japan's going to get a different version of the Karaoke app.
5784000	5787000	The Karaoke app is interesting because, I don't know if you guys have heard about this,
5787000	5790000	but the Karaoke app is not where you pay for the app.
5790000	5795000	You pay for a rental, I think it's like 10 bucks for a 24 hour period,
5795000	5799000	or maybe it was like 3 bucks for 2 hours.
5799000	5803000	Don't quote me on that, but it was like, you can pay to rent it,
5803000	5807000	but then it's like all the songs for that period of time.
5807000	5811000	So that's interesting.
5811000	5815000	You can turn your living room into one of those Karaoke studios
5815000	5817000	and have all those songs at your fingertips.
5817000	5818000	It's an interesting way to do it.
5818000	5821000	I'd be interested to check it out next time I have a party.
5821000	5823000	People love Karaoke.
5823000	5827000	SkyDrive, by the way, there's old Orange Launch Radio episodes on SkyDrive.
5827000	5831000	There used to be information on the Orange Launch Radio forums,
5831000	5835000	but those are kind of sunsetted now that we have the VOG Network forums.
5835000	5838000	Maybe Dark Tetsuya can post the information on the VOG Network forums.
5838000	5840000	There is a SkyDrive login you can use.
5840000	5842000	It's just like an On Your Honor thing.
5842000	5843000	Please don't go in there and fuck it up,
5843000	5846000	because people worked very hard to put in the old episodes.
5846000	5848000	But there is a login you can use for the SkyDrive.
5848000	5851000	I'm just going to warn you, it was a very different show
5851000	5854000	back in the first 200 episodes.
5854000	5857000	But if you really want to hear what did Episode 1 sound like,
5857000	5858000	it's on the SkyDrive.
5858000	5860000	So you can hear that through your 360 now.
5860000	5862000	You can't even get VOG through your 360,
5862000	5867000	but you can get old-ass OLR episodes thanks to the SkyDrive app.
5867000	5868000	Pretty cool.
5868000	5870000	And the Maxim and CNET are just, you know...
5870000	5874000	You can't download VOG episodes using Internet Explorer through the...?
5875000	5878000	You can't use the live radio player in Internet Explorer,
5878000	5880000	which is weird, I don't know why.
5880000	5881000	Because it's Internet Explorer?
5881000	5883000	Well, I don't get it.
5883000	5885000	I thought the audio was protected,
5885000	5887000	but I went to the website where our player...
5887000	5889000	Bobby might know more of the technical end of it,
5889000	5891000	but I went to the website where the player that's on our website comes from,
5891000	5893000	and the test MP3 works okay.
5893000	5895000	I think it has something to do with the streaming MP3s.
5895000	5898000	Like, remember for a long time, Google Chrome wouldn't play VOG Network
5898000	5900000	when we first launched because of security things?
5900000	5902000	I think it's something similar to that.
5902000	5906000	I don't know if you can play the MP3s on demand on the show pages.
5906000	5907000	I haven't tried that.
5907000	5909000	But honestly, if you're going to go to all that trouble,
5909000	5913000	just turn on your PC and download the shows.
5913000	5914000	Come on.
5915000	5916000	All right.
5916000	5918000	Also, coming to the Wii U,
5918000	5921000	Unepic is a game that's coming to the Wii U.
5921000	5924000	It's a 2D platformer that features RPG elements,
5924000	5927000	bosses, pets, potions, and so forth.
5927000	5929000	They're calling it a Metroidvania-style game,
5929000	5931000	which always, you know, I like those types of game.
5931000	5935000	No idea what the release date is, but they're saying soon.
5935000	5936000	But that could be anything.
5936000	5940000	But that's a really neat-looking game for the Wii U, I gotta say.
5940000	5943000	So I'm all about that.
5943000	5944000	Yes, please.
5945000	5948000	We will see when that comes out to the Wii U at some point.
5948000	5949000	Dark Sakura.
5949000	5951000	Well, in other gaming news,
5951000	5955000	we have some stuff coming out of Imani style about a new DDR game.
5955000	5959000	Well, not really new because it was supposed to be out in February this year.
5959000	5965000	It was announced originally as Dance Dance Revolution GREE.
5965000	5968000	And now we have Dance Wars that basically has,
5968000	5974000	it's a follow-up from the Dance Dance Revolution S&S Plus that came out on smartphones,
5974000	5978000	but now has multiplayer functionality and uses social networking.
5978000	5982000	And no word about a US release,
5982000	5985000	but they said there was an international intent to release.
5985000	5988000	And then OEA.
5989000	5996000	They have rebranded their Play for Free brand into Origin Free to Play.
5996000	5998000	Yeah, but still, Origin sucks.
5999000	6000000	No one cur to play.
6001000	6004000	And then, a game that fights bullies.
6004000	6005000	Rubber Kid.
6006000	6012000	Basically, it's a Kickstarter that's supposed to be raising money to fight bullying,
6012000	6021000	and they're hoping to get $750 to basically do a tie-in book, comic, cyber-bullying edition,
6021000	6026000	that will get people into the dialogue about bullying
6026000	6028000	and teach kids ways to protect themselves.
6029000	6030000	So that's it.
6031000	6032000	Alright.
6032000	6036000	Let's get into the foogle question of the week,
6036000	6039000	because every week we ask a question on Facebook and Google.
6039000	6041000	You slam them together, you get foogle.
6043000	6044000	Foogle.
6049000	6055000	This week in the foogle question of the week kind of ties into something we were asking about earlier on the show,
6055000	6057000	or talking about earlier anyway.
6057000	6059000	When a company launches an online multiplayer game,
6059000	6063000	how long do you believe they are obligated to support that online multiplayer game?
6063000	6066000	Are you bothered when support is pulled after only two years?
6066000	6067000	Yay.
6067000	6071000	Are there any old games you can't play online anymore that you wish you could?
6071000	6076000	What do you think we could do to convince companies to support that game online?
6076000	6081000	AgDef says, well, for consoles, they should be set up as long as the console's life cycle.
6081000	6086000	For example, at least until the next console is launched, or a year or two later after it launches.
6086000	6088000	As for PCs, that's more complicated,
6088000	6092000	but I would think that if a lot of people are playing the game as multiplayer,
6092000	6095000	they should keep the servers up, or at least give the players an alternative or something.
6095000	6096000	That's from Google+.
6097000	6104000	Surtur says, at least three years or post two sequel versions of the game.
6104000	6106000	I think is what he meant to say.
6106000	6110000	Retertainment says, it's not about length, it's about usage.
6110000	6115000	If people are still actively playing the game, the company who made the game should still support it.
6115000	6118000	The cost of the support also factors in the decision.
6118000	6121000	However, in the cases of big companies like EA and Activision,
6121000	6124000	the question of supporting a product should not be brought up.
6126000	6128000	That's kind of an interesting way to word it.
6128000	6133000	Is that because they can't be trusted to support it long enough because they crank out the sequels so fast?
6133000	6137000	I'm left to kind of infer that from what's being said.
6137000	6143000	Well, I think in the case of EA, they should be supporting it because you have to pay that stupid online pass.
6143000	6146000	That's true. I didn't even include that in the question.
6146000	6148000	But yeah, the online pass kind of...
6148000	6154000	I'd be pissed off if a game I had to pay an online pass for, let me say I bought it used,
6154000	6157000	and then it shuts down three years later.
6157000	6159000	Fuck that. No, I paid an online pass.
6159000	6163000	This is supposed to be to support your server or whatever.
6163000	6165000	You're going to shut it down immediately.
6165000	6170000	I thought there was one game so far they've shut down that had an online pass.
6170000	6172000	But we haven't had any since then, right?
6172000	6174000	But I bet that's coming.
6174000	6176000	Brace yourselves.
6176000	6184000	Well, even look at some of the games like Saints Row the Third or whatever that lock System Link behind an online pass.
6184000	6185000	Yeah, I remember that.
6185000	6190000	It's like, what? System Link behind an online pass? You guys are assholes.
6192000	6196000	I'm going to some of the answers from Facebook at facebook.com slash orange launch radio.
6196000	6201000	Tigerclaw says, I noticed only a small handful of games had their online multiplayer pulled.
6201000	6207000	But games like Battlefront II still have online, and I see a lot of people playing the games online multiplayer on the PlayStation 2 version.
6207000	6210000	So some games never get their support pulled, it seems.
6210000	6214000	I mean, for a PlayStation 2 game to still have online support, that's pretty...
6214000	6217000	I would have thought Final Fantasy XI was the only one left.
6217000	6221000	Raginator says, there's no one catch-all blanket answer, honestly.
6221000	6229000	The best I can offer as an answer is to say that so long as the gaming community has at least a moderate amount of support for the game as far as multiplayer is concerned,
6229000	6232000	then the devs publisher should support the game by keeping it up.
6232000	6235000	Yeah, I know, moderate is purely subjective.
6235000	6238000	And then he adds as an afterthought, I'll add this to my answer.
6238000	6243000	Alternatively, online multiplayer should only come down if Loki refuses to wear the tingle costume.
6243000	6247000	Yet another listener working that joke into the show.
6247000	6251000	All the games are coming down tomorrow, thanks to that answer, Raginator.
6251000	6255000	When you can't play Halo 4 online tomorrow, blame Raginator.
6255000	6264000	JG2000 responds and says, I believe a company is only obligated to support online multiplayer until the next incarnation of the game is released.
6264000	6268000	If a new version isn't released, it should stay online for a minimum of two years.
6268000	6276000	The percentage of people on these games that are die-hard dedicated is far less than the people willing to move on to a new game or the next installment of a game.
6276000	6279000	I speak from personal experience, of course.
6279000	6282000	I gotta admit, he's naming some pretty tight windows there.
6282000	6285000	I mean, until the next incarnation of the game.
6285000	6288000	I mean, if you're EA, that's every year, basically, right?
6288000	6291000	For the sports games, that means it would only be a year.
6291000	6295000	But I do get what he's saying is that most people move on.
6295000	6300000	But this online pass thing is gonna have an interesting element to it, and not everybody.
6300000	6302000	Some people buy those games used.
6302000	6305000	You buy the previous year because it's cheap, and it's pretty much the same thing.
6305000	6309000	Or say you don't like a version of the game when it comes out and it sucks or something like that.
6309000	6311000	Like has happened with some of the basketball games.
6311000	6317000	Like NBA Live, you know, say you buy NBA Live 10, I think that was the last one.
6317000	6321000	And you didn't like it.
6321000	6326000	Or you didn't want to buy the next one because it never came out in the last two years.
6326000	6330000	Black Wolf telling us that game with the online pass that shut down.
6330000	6332000	It was EA Sports MMA was the game.
6332000	6335000	He's linking to a story that talks about those shutdowns.
6335000	6338000	So the online pass adds an interesting element.
6338000	6343000	And I'm seeing a common theme in these answers, which is kind of the logical answer.
6343000	6347000	They should only keep them up as long as people are using them, which makes sense.
6347000	6353000	But even for those, let's say there's 20 die-hard fans that still play it.
6353000	6355000	And it's not considered to be enough.
6355000	6361000	Does the plug get pulled on those 20 people who now have paid an additional $10 in the form of an online pass to be there?
6361000	6363000	We have to pull the plug?
6363000	6368000	I mean, it's a tricky line to walk, I think.
6368000	6371000	Anyway, let's read some more answers. Let's see if we still have a consensus going on.
6371000	6381000	Burr says, I feel like games shouldn't be dependent on a central provider or matchmaking service unless they're an MMO or some other always-on experience.
6381000	6383000	Well, let me throw this out there.
6383000	6387000	Would you consider the new SimCity or Diablo 3 an always-online experience?
6387000	6389000	I just had to throw that out there.
6389000	6395000	It's stupid to me that a shooter, for instance, would be unplayable online just because there's no other option for hosting a game.
6395000	6400000	In the case of an MMO, though, they should only feel obligated to run it as long as they're turning a profit.
6400000	6403000	Unfortunately, in the case of City of Heroes, that apparently wasn't enough.
6403000	6410000	Shame on NCSoft for simply shutting it down instead of handing it off to someone else if the profit wasn't enough for them.
6410000	6412000	Or what about just throwing this out there?
6412000	6414000	What about opening it up to the public domain?
6414000	6416000	That's what Phantasy Star Blue Burst did, right?
6416000	6418000	Dr. Sakurai, you follow that more than I did.
6418000	6423000	When Blue Burst closed, didn't they just release everything you needed to do to your own private server?
6423000	6424000	Yeah.
6424000	6425000	I thought that was a classy way to do it.
6425000	6428000	And they let you actually pull off your character data off their server.
6428000	6430000	That's awesome. That's classy.
6430000	6440000	Cram says, I think it should depend on how many people are still playing and how many iterations of the game, in the case of a yearly release game like sports games and shooters, are active at the same time.
6440000	6444000	If nobody's playing or you're coming onto three or four iterations, it's time to cut the support.
6445000	6450000	Codeman says, from a business aspect, if people aren't playing, why spend the money to keep the servers up?
6450000	6458000	But I do believe if you are going to make multiplayer game, and that is a portion that will never be removed, don't remove online play.
6458000	6462000	Because that person paid money for it, so you should support it for life.
6462000	6470000	Rob himself says, if it's to pay, if it's pay to play per month, they should support that online multiplayer game.
6470000	6475000	If they don't, it should be 100% free unless it's totally crap. Then burn it with fire.
6475000	6482000	Well, here's my question. Does pay to play online mean a monthly fee or does it mean online pass?
6482000	6490000	And lastly, Mike B says, probably until there is only one person playing it online by themselves, then shut it down.
6490000	6499000	So it does seem to be there's a general consensus amongst the listeners of the answer of, you know, when the people disappear, then so should the game.
6499000	6508000	Although nobody's really naming what that threshold is. Is that 2% of the initial base? Is that 10%? Is it a certain time frame?
6508000	6518000	You know, where is the point that you pull the plug? Does that mean the next time we have one of these stories about server shutdowns, it's just going to be, oh well, no biggie.
6518000	6523000	We knew this was coming. This is what we've come to accept. It's interesting to me.
6524000	6528000	But I like the way Sega did it. I got to say, I think that's a model for how it should be done.
6528000	6539000	Is that if companies are going to shut down the online support, then open it up for people who are fans of the game to let it live on if they want. Right?
6539000	6547000	I think so. I still wish that, you know, all of these MMOs will just go the path that Sega did like we discussed.
6548000	6556000	Alright, let's move on with some other news. We'll get to the mailbag, the FUs of the week, and phone calls in just a little bit. First off, more news. Loki.
6556000	6565000	Alright, so there's going to be a few companies dropped from the Nasdaq 100. And you may think, oh, THQ. No, it's actually not THQ.
6565000	6573000	It is some bigger companies, including Electronic Arts. Electronic Arts is going to be dropped off there as well as RIM.
6573000	6585000	And also Netflix is being removed as well. So kind of interesting that those are being dropped there. And I guess, of course, they're adding Facebook as well.
6588000	6592000	Honestly, what does that mean? No fucking clue because I don't do finances.
6593000	6604000	Well, usually if they are, I think the Nasdaq 100 is what, the top 100? Yeah. So these, you know, and especially in the case like Facebook, I don't think it's still caught up to where it debuted.
6604000	6611000	So it hasn't really met investor expectations. And, you know, these other gaming companies have had kind of a rough year.
6611000	6615000	This will all go into effect, I guess, on the 24th.
6615000	6624000	But Netflix had a really shitty year investor wise because, I mean, they're gaining ground again for it. But remember the whole Quickster debacle? That was this year, right?
6624000	6630000	It was earlier this year. That fucked them royally. And a lot of people pinned the CEOs handling of it, honestly.
6630000	6636000	And, you know, they've been making some smart decisions since then, the whole Arrested Development, and they've been doing a lot right.
6636000	6643000	But the way they handled that whole Quickster thing, their stock plummeted. And that probably almost single handedly was what.
6643000	6648000	I'm very happy to see that they finally have added It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I thought that was always there.
6648000	6657000	No, no, no, no. They just added it, I think. I think they added it back. But, yeah, I mean, they're doing better, I guess.
6657000	6663000	I am kind of disappointed, though, that they don't have the game rental service because that would be pretty cool.
6663000	6669000	Well, if you don't know the name Austin Wintory, then you have a very short term memory because we just talked about him last week.
6669000	6678000	He got nominated for a Grammy for doing Journey, the soundtrack. Of course, it's the first full album to be nominated for a Grammy that's from a video game.
6678000	6685000	Well, what is the next project that Austin Wintory will be working on? It's gonna be Leisure Suit Larry.
6687000	6696000	Yes, and I wasn't sure if this was parody or what, but no. Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the next game that he's slated to score.
6696000	6703000	In an interview with Polygon, he said, quote, That's my era as a gamer growing up. This was like a fantasy to work on a game like that.
6705000	6711000	You know what? Some artists want to do something radically different when they go from project to project.
6711000	6723000	And I can't think of something more different than an artistic piece that you could hang on the wall like a painting, like Journey, and then going to Leisure Suit Larry.
6723000	6727000	Which hopefully will be better than the last round of those games, which were so bad.
6727000	6730000	Well, Leisure Suit Larry is just a remake of the first one, so it's gonna be good.
6732000	6733000	Not necessarily.
6733000	6734000	Oh, come on. It's gonna be good.
6734000	6736000	Remakes are not always better.
6736000	6742000	I had fun with some of the other ones, but yeah, like the last game that they put out was crap, but the one before that wasn't...
6743000	6749000	It was bad, but it wasn't super terrible. It was fun. They had some interesting things on there, like the mini games were kind of funny.
6750000	6757000	But yeah, it'll be awesome to be able to score like porn music with an orchestra.
6759000	6760000	Fantastic.
6761000	6763000	Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura.
6764000	6778000	Moving forward, we do have some information coming out of Microsoft. They're finally lifting the Windows Store issue ban with the age 18 rated games.
6778000	6784000	Basically, that includes Dishonored, Mass Effect 3, Assassin's Creed 3, within the Windows Store.
6785000	6794000	So, they were going to not sell the PEGI 18 titles, but then they rethought it and said they want to expand their commitment to Windows Store games.
6795000	6808000	So, it was originally in there that said their app must not contain adult content and metadata must be appropriate for everyone, but now they're just saying, eh, just let them decide.
6809000	6816000	You know, it was kind of ridiculous that they removed the whole Microsoft Excel off there because its metadata was fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, Excel.
6817000	6820000	You know, and some people that may be a selling point, but yeah.
6820000	6826000	Well, back in the day, there was like, what, the hidden gate to hell in Excel back on Windows 3.1?
6827000	6828000	That's just a standard...
6828000	6829000	What?
6829000	6841000	Yeah, it was programmed into Excel. It was either Excel or Word, but I think it was Excel. There was like just a little small bit of data that, you know, you could walk around this little temple.
6841000	6846000	It was like a temple to something that was hidden in early versions of Excel that was just like a developer Easter egg.
6847000	6848000	I'll find it. Hold on.
6848000	6855000	All right. No, I believe you. I just never heard of that. How funny. Moving on.
6856000	6857000	All right. Well...
6857000	6859000	One of them was a flight sim.
6859000	6870000	Wouldn't that be fun? Well, Machinima.com has reduced their staff by 10% and, you know, this is kind of odd because I thought the company was doing pretty well.
6870000	6880000	I mean, they got a lot of ties and exclusives and stuff, and they started just doing like, you know, a lot of affiliate channels and stuff like that.
6881000	6892000	Of course, the editor-in-chief, Rob Smith, said that, I guess, 23 people in the company's 200 staff were let go across programming and production.
6892000	6898000	I guess editorial. And this is Growing Pains. Machinima has grown a lot in a short amount of time.
6899000	6907000	We had to look at the business and we're focusing. It has hit the editorial group, but we're still doing editorial coverage in a slightly different way.
6908000	6912000	So it's just, I guess, they maybe hired too many people for what they need.
6913000	6916000	Badly managed.
6917000	6927000	I guess, yeah, whatever. So 10%, I mean, yeah, it sucks that, you know, but when you hear like 10% normally, it's like hundreds of jobs at 20s. Not so bad.
6928000	6930000	I mean, it's not great, but, you know.
6931000	6936000	Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Machinima is shady. You heard about the stuff about the contracts.
6937000	6944000	Oh, yeah, that was in the news some time ago. People rebelling out of the blood packs, basically. They were signing with Machinima. Own you forever.
6945000	6950000	I don't know why you would partner with Machinima anyways, like for like a YouTube channel doesn't make any sense why you do that.
6951000	6958000	The popularity, you know, people get blinded by the fact that people want to pay you money for doing this kind of stuff.
6959000	6964000	And, you know, people just make rash decisions sometimes. And not even like, I shouldn't say that.
6965000	6973000	Like, I make it sound like everybody who's signing a deal with the company is making a bad decision. Maybe not necessarily, you know, but some people sometimes make decisions that they regret later.
6974000	6982000	Have you ever maybe had a job in your life where after you were there a couple months you're like, maybe I shouldn't have taken this job. Right?
6983000	6984000	Never.
6985000	6990000	Never, right? No, I would never say that. So, you know. Anyhow.
6991000	6996000	One more story before we get to the mailbag and that is about Capcom and Mega Man.
6996000	7005000	Now, we've got this whole Street Fighter across Mega Man thing happening tomorrow. Just a reminder, probably today for most of you listening to the podcast.
7006000	7012000	There's a ton more things we have in the works according to USA Senior Vice President Christian Svensson.
7013000	7018000	Only some of which will be shared December 17th. This is in regards to Mega Man, of course.
7018000	7025000	There's a whole year of things that will happen. You're only going to hear about what's happening fairly close to the start of the celebrations at first.
7026000	7028000	So could we be getting some bombshell news about Mega Man tomorrow?
7029000	7030000	None of which will be Mega Man Legends 3.
7031000	7032000	Or should I say Blue Bombshell?
7037000	7039000	So anyhow, could be a big day tomorrow. We'll see.
7040000	7043000	But at least there's that free Street Fighter Mega Man game that'll be cool.
7043000	7044000	That's cool.
7045000	7049000	I mean, even if it was fan community, but it's cool to Capcom and they linked up and made it happen.
7050000	7053000	I'll be downloading it. That's for sure.
7054000	7055000	Should we get to the mailbag?
7056000	7057000	Why don't we should?
7063000	7072000	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and picks out a few emails to share with us on the show.
7073000	7078000	It's only a three hour show. We can't read every single email, but we do read them.
7079000	7080000	And then I laugh at them.
7081000	7082000	No you don't. Well sometimes you do.
7083000	7084000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7085000	7086000	I'm going to read the one that was written to you.
7087000	7088000	Alright.
7089000	7094000	Hi Rob. I visited the National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York yesterday. Their electronic gaming section was fairly extensive.
7095000	7100000	They had exhibits covering pinball to pong to current gen systems. They even have an arcade set up with about 20 cabinets.
7100000	7107000	I funneled a couple tokens into Tapper and Paperboy, but it just wasn't the same without the sticky floors and rude attendant.
7108000	7114000	I thought you would enjoy these pictures as you are the only other person I know of that has my level of nostalgia for the Commodore 64.
7115000	7116000	Yay! Commodore 64!
7117000	7121000	They had two C64s, one in a text based adventure section and another in a computer gaming area.
7122000	7124000	I hope this doesn't make you feel as old as it made me feel.
7124000	7130000	I think I'm going to have to dig mine out of the box in my mom's basement and fire up Ultima IV in way of the exploding fest.
7131000	7133000	You're a bastard for having one that still works. Just saying.
7134000	7142000	The other great thing was that they had a collection of Star Wars action figures, most of which I owned at some point, but my sister sold at a garage sale when I was shipped over to Operation Desert Storm.
7143000	7145000	I never saw any of the money. Damn her. Damn her to heck.
7146000	7148000	At least she didn't sell many of my comics.
7149000	7150000	So why is he a few busy planes? Stop.
7151000	7152000	Because this is where he's pissed off.
7152000	7157000	The museum was a lot of fun, not a destination, but if you or any of your listeners happen to be in upstate New York, it's worth a side trip.
7158000	7167000	Peace Lat Rat Y2K. Dishonored Edges out. Oh, ME3 and Halo 4 as my GOTY.
7168000	7170000	I'm going for the pictures right now. Let's see.
7171000	7172000	Pac-Man!
7172000	7176000	Oh, these pictures are gigantic. I'm trying to scale them down.
7177000	7181000	But look what Pac-Man is next to if I scroll over. Oh yeah, an old school Commodore 64.
7182000	7186000	Sitting in glass. In case of emergency, break glass.
7187000	7192000	Play Commodore 64. Oh, look at that. A Zork 2 box.
7193000	7197000	Good times. There's a floppy hanging on the wall. Good stuff.
7197000	7201000	Curse you for having a Commodore 64 that still works, though.
7202000	7204000	Next up? Yes, next up.
7205000	7212000	Hey, OLR crew. AZHP here. I didn't get a chance to comment on the FUGL question of the week last week, so I decided to give my answer via email.
7213000	7214000	Oh, sorry, you're late. Click. No.
7215000	7219000	As a refresher, last week's question was, and I'm paraphrasing, have video games ever taught you something?
7220000	7223000	Thank you for putting that in your email, because we all would have forgotten, honestly.
7224000	7225000	Do I ever pay attention to that?
7225000	7229000	The only one I paid attention to was, what do you want for holidays? And I'm like, Garris.
7230000	7235000	Anyway. My answer is, video games taught me how to gain self-confidence and make lifelong friends.
7236000	7246000	When I started playing DDR back in 1998, shut up. I never imagined that the confidence I gained from being good at DDR would lead to me breaking out of my shell and interacting with people who treated me-
7247000	7250000	Wait, why did you tell him to shut up for saying he played the game back in 98? That's when it came out.
7251000	7253000	I know, but it was like back in 98? I don't know.
7253000	7256000	14 years later, we are old as fuck.
7257000	7258000	Shut up, shut up, shut up.
7259000	7260000	Let me finish reading the email, Rob.
7261000	7270000	Who treated me as an equal despite my nerdy anti-social demeanor. I wouldn't be the person I am today without video games. I'm sure you guys and gal at OLR would tend to agree.
7271000	7278000	Thanks for letting me rant about how awesome video games are. You guys rock. Yours truly, AZHP. And seriously, thank you. Yeah, I get that too.
7279000	7280000	I think that's a great email.
7280000	7281000	I want to play drums.
7282000	7295000	I think that's a great email because, you know, this show was born of that same community and our three awkward selves got brought together to do this show for all you awkward listeners. No, I'm just kidding. We're all a little awkward in our own way.
7296000	7299000	Speak for yourself, awkward. No. Last email.
7300000	7302000	That's kind of an awkward statement you just made. I'm just saying.
7303000	7304000	Your face is awkward.
7305000	7306000	It's a little awkward in here right now.
7306000	7309000	Awkward is such a fun word, isn't it? Because it's like got W's and K's in it.
7314000	7316000	Talk about awkward. That was a weird thing to say.
7317000	7320000	This is not me, but does the word awkward just look awkward?
7321000	7323000	You know what other word has W's and K's in it?
7324000	7325000	Work.
7326000	7327000	But it only has one W.
7329000	7335000	Hi gang. It's your friendly neighborhood rage-inator. I just thought I'd email a quick question just in case I don't get to call in for whatever reason.
7336000	7341000	The subject of VOG's music stream was the topic of a short discussion yesterday, Saturday, just before USL.
7342000	7347000	I think a few of us have a question directly, I'm sorry, directed to Rob seeing as how he's in charge of the music stream.
7348000	7355000	Will the community have the ability to donate any legally purchased music, either bought already on disc or bought via iTunes or whatever and burned to disc?
7356000	7361000	And would be appropriate for, and I guess that would be what would be appropriate for the feed.
7361000	7369000	I know that mainstream stuff that one would typically hear on terrestrial radio wouldn't work for obvious reasons, but I can see how game OST's and whatnots would be doable.
7370000	7377000	I'll go ahead and say, I gave Rob like, how many DVDs worth of stuff?
7378000	7384000	I do try to pick and choose stuff because I want it to be like, upbeat. I don't want a lot of drab stuff.
7384000	7391000	But yeah, you can of course always make suggestions. Here's the thing though, remember, I have no problem with the music or whatever that you guys want to suggest.
7392000	7396000	We do have a suggestion thread for that. Keep in mind though, no major label stuff.
7397000	7408000	There's some weird Al stuff we snuck in there, but we're just trying to keep the focus on indie and geek things and also do remember we don't want game soundtracks to dominate.
7408000	7415000	I mean obviously game sound, gaming is part of geekery, but we want it to be a balance between stuff.
7416000	7423000	So just, you know, no Lady Gaga or you know what I mean. Try to keep it a couple steps below top 40.
7424000	7427000	For the example, I'm very disappointed with her Christmas single, just saying.
7428000	7434000	Also I will say this, speaking of Christmas single, I have been given a huge library of geeky holiday music.
7435000	7440000	I am not the type of person to turn on holiday music the day after Thanksgiving, however that shit drives me nuts.
7441000	7447000	But we will be turning on the holiday music at some point next week and we'll let it run for one week and then it's gone.
7448000	7455000	So enjoy it on the feed while you can because I'm taking out my whole, I cannot stand how the holiday music goes on for months and months.
7455000	7457000	You get one week of holiday music on vlog.
7458000	7466000	At my work? That's all anyone wants to listen to. And the only way I can really stand it after a while is if I just change it to Christmas jazz.
7467000	7469000	Because sometimes I get really pretty music with no lyrics.
7470000	7476000	Black Wolf in Chat says no mashups. Yes and no. I don't want to mash up with a top 40 song.
7477000	7489000	But there's a remix of the theme to Skyrim that's done like some type of, I don't remember what it's called, but it's like a remix of that.
7490000	7496000	I guess you might be able to call a mashup and that's okay. So as long as it's indie stuff that's mashed together, that's fine.
7497000	7502000	Alright, I see that one more email just dropped in the bag. You might want to refresh because this one's funny.
7503000	7504000	I already closed it.
7504000	7507000	You want me to open it back up? You want me to read it? You read it. Alright, I'll read it.
7508000	7514000	One more email because I re-opened the mailbag. I bet it's Exeterfer. No, it's not. It's Jim Salley actually. Oh, hi Jim Salley.
7515000	7519000	And I only saw it because I went back into the email bag to look at those Commodore 64 pictures.
7520000	7522000	And I saw this from Jim Salley.
7523000	7532000	Hey sexy host of OLR. You ever use vibrating controllers for naughty purposes? Like tickling someone's pussy?
7532000	7533000	Res?
7535000	7541000	And then he signs the email, cat, be nice for Santa this year, Jim Salley.
7542000	7545000	Dark Sakura, have you ever tickled someone's pussy with a controller?
7546000	7548000	Well, Shermy used to like sitting on the controller.
7549000	7550000	Good answer.
7551000	7554000	I miss my kitty. I need a cat in my life.
7555000	7560000	By the way, just to make an announcement, Sanrio let me pet her.
7561000	7562000	Yay.
7563000	7568000	I know, I know. They can't hear you, Alan. Alan just got home and he's talking about the cat.
7569000	7571000	I even got purr noises.
7572000	7578000	So, Loki, have you ever done anything naughty with a controller? Of course none of us have done anything naughty with a controller.
7579000	7582000	I've thrown the controller at the cat to get her to stop doing something that she was doing.
7583000	7585000	My husband's crushed one in his hands several times.
7585000	7593000	Like batting, like she likes to, you know, knock stuff off the Christmas tree and stuff, so I'll throw like something at her. Sometimes it's a controller.
7594000	7596000	Oh, I get it. Like tickling someone's pussy.
7597000	7598000	Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, cat.
7599000	7601000	I get it because that's how it was signed. I get it. I get it.
7602000	7607000	Tickling someone's pussy cat. Um, no, I've never, I've never done that to the cat. The cats would not let me do that.
7608000	7609000	Alan would get very angry with me if I tried to do that.
7609000	7614000	Is Shermie one time really freaked out at the heartbeat thing in Silent Hill?
7615000	7622000	Because she was just sitting next to me while I was playing Silent Hill 3, so I put the controller on her back and she about jumped. It was hilarious.
7623000	7624000	Good times.
7625000	7626000	By the way, Rez.
7627000	7631000	Alright, that's it for the email bag, so let's get to the FUs of the week because we're so angry, Roz.
7639000	7645000	Here is justice. Here is punishment. This is fucked up.
7646000	7657000	I feed my hair for being in that weird in between haircuts kind of thing, but I've made a vow that I'm not going to cut my hair at least until my birthday.
7658000	7665000	Maybe a trim, but not like a for reals haircut. To see if I can stand growing out my hair for four months. That's it.
7666000	7667000	Uh, Loki.
7668000	7673000	I feed my brain for not wanting me to do, like, sell work right now. It's just like, no.
7674000	7678000	So I just can't work on this. I'm going to anyways. I don't know.
7679000	7687000	It's like I've been trying to, like, you know, get stuff done that have all these projects that are kind of in the works that I just quit wanting to go to another one.
7688000	7693000	So I'm starting to try to wrap a bunch of these up so I don't have a bunch of pending products. Any projects I'm working on.
7693000	7698000	So this is one of them. My Grand Theft Auto mods that I've been working on for two years.
7699000	7706000	Uh, I'm going to give a good old fashioned Orange Mountains Radio F.U. to traffic. Namely the traffic driving you to San Francisco yesterday.
7707000	7712000	Three hours and fifteen minutes for what was one hour and forty minutes today on the way home.
7713000	7719000	Do you know what the difference was between yesterday and today? Rain. Because nobody knows how to drive in the fucking rain.
7719000	7728000	It's California. So irritating. It's like, ooh, there's a car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazard lights on. Let's break. Go 70. Break. Go 70. Break.
7731000	7732000	I hate you.
7733000	7741000	So yeah, that was very irritating because, you know, if we got to the city a little earlier, we could try to find more gay bars with pinball machines. That's all I'm saying.
7741000	7749000	Alright, um, let's get into a couple more news stories and then Twitter topics and our Skype line. Loki!
7750000	7760000	Alright, so, um, let's see. Let's talk a little bit about, um, a series that I used to be into back when I watched anime but I don't anymore so that kind of sucks.
7761000	7763000	But did you know they're doing a Ghost in the Shell MMO?
7764000	7765000	Are they? That sounds cool.
7765000	7773000	That's fantastic. And I guess it's going to be a partnership between Nexon and Kodansha.
7774000	7776000	Is it based off of Stand Alone Complex?
7777000	7787000	It is Stand Alone Complex and I believe it's, was it Stand Alone Complex and Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig. And also the Solid State Society.
7788000	7798000	So, um, pretty cool. They didn't really, um, give any details other than, you know, the series. The PlayStation game was the last Ghost in the Shell game I played and that was fantastic.
7799000	7801000	Running around the Fujikomas. Love it.
7802000	7804000	Do we really need another MMO though? There's too many.
7805000	7807000	No. But Ghost in the Shell is pretty awesome though.
7808000	7809000	Yeah, Ghost in the Shell is pretty cool.
7810000	7814000	Yeah, I actually liked the original Ghost in the Shell. I didn't really see any of the new series.
7814000	7822000	One more story for you guys tonight before we open up the Skype line at 1877 game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7823000	7830000	And this is an interesting follow up to one of the debates that was going on, I think two weeks ago on the show was when we got into this. Remember the THQ bundle?
7831000	7833000	And a lot of people were saying, oh, it jumped the shark and so on.
7834000	7840000	And, um, one of the big things that people were taking issue with was that this was one of the first bundles where the games didn't run on Linux.
7840000	7844000	So it was kind of like we were going in this direction where we were ignoring Linux and so on.
7845000	7847000	Well, it's interesting what's come out after that.
7848000	7858000	According to THQ President Jason Rubin in an interview with Polygon, he said that, you know, THQ's goal should be to bring entertainment to a wide audience.
7859000	7860000	Here's the quote.
7860000	7871000	The message I took away from a large number of tweets and comments around the THQ Humble Bundle sale is that there are vibrant communities of gamers using other operating systems besides the dominant ones.
7872000	7874000	And a company like THQ should not overlook them.
7875000	7882000	So they're kind of, in a way, which is pretty fascinating for one of the bigger companies to do, they're kind of coming out and admitting, you know what we learned through this?
7883000	7884000	Maybe we are neglecting Linux.
7885000	7892000	Maybe there was enough, you know, support being buzzed out there that, you know, and especially for a company that's really struggling right now.
7893000	7903000	And in some ways, you know, having an identity crisis of sorts and trying new things, you almost feel like they're kind of like, I, you know, yes, it's just one pull quote or whatever.
7904000	7911000	But I do still feel like he means it much more than a lot of other people would because THQ is in a desperate situation right now.
7912000	7915000	Do you think we could see Saints Row on Linux someday?
7916000	7920000	Yeah, probably not. But I thought the lesson he would learn is gamers hate everything.
7921000	7923000	Because really that's the lesson that needs to be learned.
7924000	7931000	It's not just, it's just people complaining, yeah, you gave me this great deal on these games, I fucking hate it because guess what, they don't run on Linux.
7932000	7935000	Well, you know what, then don't buy it. Just like the fucking Android ones.
7935000	7941000	Guess what, the Android games don't run on Linux either. But who cares? Don't buy it.
7942000	7952000	Another quote about the feedback, complicating the analysis in a positive way, gamers have tweeted inventive ideas to me, such as letting the community help in the porting to bring down costs.
7953000	7959000	THQ is committed to look at anything that makes sense. I'm sure we'll have more to announce shortly.
7959000	7976000	Community sourced porting. This is a desperate company right now, and I hate to say it, I know this sounds really like opportunistic and like I'm dancing on their grave of sorts, but like, what a great thing that's happening because of the fact that this company is struggling so bad.
7980000	7981000	I don't know, it's just me.
7982000	7987000	Here's an idea, don't fucking lock SystemLink behind online passes. I'm gonna get myself a little bit better.
7987000	7988000	Seriously.
7989000	8004000	Alright. Let us move on to the Skype line, 1877 game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. If you want to give us a call right now and talk about whatever's on your mind, anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something we haven't yet.
8005000	8009000	In the meantime, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute news, I'm gonna pull up the Twitters here.
8010000	8012000	No I don't, because nothing's happening.
8013000	8014000	Yeah, it was kind of a slow news.
8015000	8016000	We had to stretch to fill the show tonight.
8017000	8020000	It was just like, uhhh, stuff.
8021000	8023000	Oh that's okay, I got stuff to do tomorrow.
8026000	8031000	Alright, well we still have the Skype line open and I am pulling up the Twitters.
8032000	8041000	I mean, Tigerclaw, one thing I want to mention, even though everyone's already noticed that's watched the Pacific Rim trailer, is that they have the voice of GLaDOS in there.
8041000	8047000	It's like, you know, hey, let's get the same voice actor as GLaDOS and then we'll just make it sound exactly like GLaDOS.
8048000	8049000	But that was a movie trailer, not a game trailer.
8050000	8051000	That was a movie trailer. It's still awesome though.
8052000	8054000	He tweeted that too, so I guess I can skip that one.
8055000	8056000	There you go.
8057000	8059000	Oh, we got a call coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8060000	8061000	Hey guys, it's Porkchop, how's it going?
8062000	8063000	Hey, Porkchop, what's on your mind buddy?
8064000	8071000	Just patiently waiting to see when Street Fighter Mega Man is actually available for download. I've been refreshing the page about a hundred times now.
8072000	8073000	Are you staying up all night?
8074000	8079000	Not just because of that, I'm actually making my first game, it's a project for college.
8080000	8088000	And I have to go down for tomorrow, so I'm just a bit of an asteroid clone, but that's not going very well so I was hoping to get the game and just slack off.
8088000	8093000	Because I can tell by your accent you're probably not in the same country we are, and I know we've talked to you before.
8094000	8095000	What time is it where you're at?
8096000	8102000	It is now 4.27 in the AM, it's great. I can see pretty colors on the walls and everything.
8103000	8104000	Is this normal for you?
8105000	8105000	
8106000	8107000	Is this normal for you that you're on the tour?
8108000	8114000	No, it's not. I'm actually just really behind on work and stuff, and tomorrow is the deadline, but I'd say we get an extension.
8115000	8116000	I'm not bothered, I got to listen to it all over, so I'm happy.
8116000	8119000	Aw, what a nice thing to say. Appreciate it.
8120000	8127000	Just to give you an idea, it's 8.30 here on the West Coast, which means it's 11.30 on the East Coast.
8128000	8134000	So best case scenario, the game will come out right after midnight on the East Coast, and that would be in about 30 minutes.
8135000	8137000	So that's your best case scenario, is that the game will come out in 30 minutes.
8138000	8140000	If it's not out in 30 minutes, I couldn't tell you when it's going to come out.
8141000	8145000	Maybe another 3 hours when it's midnight on the West Coast, or maybe they're going to wait until the work day starts tomorrow.
8146000	8148000	It might not really be out for you until tomorrow night, I hate to say it.
8149000	8153000	Either way, I'm going to be awake, I don't care. I'm just going to waste the whole day playing it. I'm really excited.
8154000	8157000	I guess you'll be having to get some energy drinks or whatever to stay up.
8158000	8166000	Yeah, I've just been drinking tea and eating lots of sugary things to kind of keep myself buzzed and try not to go to sleep, because I want to get this finished for tomorrow at the same time.
8167000	8169000	So what is it you're studying in school?
8169000	8174000	I'm actually doing game design. It's pretty basic at the minute, using a lot of Blender.
8175000	8183000	Basically the first thing is an Asteroids clone, so it's pretty cool that you learn in bits and pieces and hopefully get into the industry somehow.
8184000	8187000	And that's what you want to end up ultimately doing, is doing design in the industry?
8188000	8194000	Actually no, it's something I wouldn't mind doing, but it's not strictly restricted.
8194000	8203000	Reviews and some things are good like that. I don't mind typing stuff up. I'm good with words. Anything at all. I just love games. I want to be involved. That's it.
8204000	8212000	How do you feel when you hear about the difficult times the industry is having? Does it make you kind of go, uh oh, what am I setting up for?
8213000	8218000	Or do you just kind of go, well these sorts of things go with the territory? What do you kind of think as a student when you hear that stuff?
8218000	8227000	I suppose each company has their issues, especially EA and the whole Mass Effect thing happened way back as well.
8228000	8239000	It doesn't bother me because there's always going to be games made. Even indie gamers now are getting a really good push up there. Fez was pretty good when it was released. You had the likes of Journey.
8240000	8243000	This guy getting a Grammy for the album?
8244000	8245000	Yes, Grammy.
8245000	8254000	Yeah, so he's doing pretty well. The medium has always been pretty well respected and I think it's going to last for a long time.
8255000	8263000	They'll just hang on in there. Games are just going to be one of those things that just hang around like TV did.
8263000	8273000	You know, if the industry doesn't break through right away, it seems like there's a couple people in chat that might support you getting into your own podcast, Radio Wing or something.
8274000	8279000	Extefer in chat says, this guy should have his own show and Hitstun says that is an awesome accent.
8280000	8283000	The girls seem to like it sometimes, but there you go.
8284000	8287000	Well, apparently some of the guys like it too, so there you go.
8288000	8291000	I don't swing that way, but very flattered, thank you very much.
8291000	8298000	So, you want to get into either designing games or critiquing them or something?
8299000	8306000	Yeah, even podcasts wouldn't bother me either. I have a couple of friends who basically have worked and know a lot about the industry and stuff.
8307000	8309000	You never know, we could team up and something good could come of it.
8310000	8313000	Well, don't ever expect a podcast to pay the rent, that's all I'm going to tell you.
8313000	8317000	Of course not, no, I'm happy to do it for fun. You guys kind of inspired me with that as well.
8318000	8321000	You're like the first game in podcast that I found and I was like, yay!
8322000	8324000	Oh, well thank you very much, that's an amazing compliment.
8325000	8332000	No, we love it when people, you know, you might think like, we're very like, don't do your own podcast, we don't want the freaking competition, but that's not realistic.
8332000	8345000	Podcasting is kind of like, I don't know, it's kind of like ham radio in some ways. It's kind of meant for, I mean you don't have to be licensed to do a podcast, but it's meant to be very open and accessible and for anybody to do them.
8346000	8354000	And we're very supportive of other people and like when people say, I was inspired to podcast because of your show, that's like the best compliment ever, I think.
8355000	8357000	You know what they say, imitation is the finest form of clarity.
8357000	8371000	Don't forget that it does take a lot of time out of your schedule as well, so respect to yourselves for keeping the show going for 400 odd episodes and I'll listen in whenever I can, whenever I have lots of work to do at half four in the morning.
8372000	8373000	Well thank you very much, I appreciate it.
8374000	8375000	We're very thankful for you.
8375000	8390000	And that's what makes it worthwhile. That's why we've sat here for coming up on 11 years next year is that type of feedback where it's like, you know, you guys just kind of BSing really helps me get through the night and get through tough times.
8391000	8397000	Like even one person telling us that is like, wow, that's powerful. So it's a great compliment, so thank you so much.
8398000	8399000	All the way across the water as well.
8400000	8410000	Awesome. All right. Well, Porkchop, I should let you go just to see if there's anybody else who wants to call in and show off their accent as well, but best of luck on your project. A plus. I hope you get over your hurdle.
8411000	8412000	Thanks guys. Keep up the good work.
8413000	8414000	All right. Take care, buddy.
8415000	8416000	Good night. Bye.
8417000	8418000	Bye.
8419000	8422000	Always good to hear. I mean, we love the people here locally too, like in the US.
8423000	8425000	I want him to read the phone book to me.
8426000	8431000	Maybe we'll have, well, maybe I should call him and see if he'd be willing to do like new closing credits.
8432000	8433000	That would be awesome.
8434000	8437000	I should do that. Get some of our international friends to do closing credits.
8438000	8439000	We need more bumpers.
8440000	8444000	This week's closing credits will be read by Porkchop. And then one week it'll be, this week's closing credits is read by Cyl.
8445000	8449000	And then we'll have one week where this week's closing credits are read by Extifer.
8450000	8451000	Balls.
8453000	8454000	Or bleached assholes.
8455000	8456000	Or trout penises.
8457000	8462000	One eight seven seven game O-L-R or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.
8463000	8467000	Going to some more tweets. Tiger Claw tweets us an article that we haven't discussed yet.
8468000	8472000	And I actually saw this before the show, but I don't know. It was just another like LOL Bobby Kotek story.
8473000	8474000	But since he shared it with us, I'll get into this.
8475000	8481000	Bobby Kotek kind of made a comment of sorts about the firing of Frank West and Vince Sampanella, who are now at EA.
8481000	8487000	He said that he fired them after learning that they were going to bail on their contracts to join EA.
8488000	8494000	Quote, you find out two executives are planning to break their contracts, keep the money you gave them, and steal 40 employees.
8495000	8496000	What do you do? You fire them.
8497000	8499000	That was in an interview with the New York Times.
8500000	8502000	Now there's all this lawsuit going on back and forth.
8503000	8505000	There was a settlement. The terms were never disclosed.
8505000	8510000	But it seems like everybody's happy, so I don't know.
8511000	8512000	But yes, now they're at EA.
8513000	8517000	I read another one. I didn't read it too closely, but there was one that was saying like,
8518000	8525000	Stop photoshopping my picture and giving me horns because it's really interrupting my dating life or some garbage like that.
8526000	8527000	It's like, whatever.
8528000	8535000	Let's see, some other tweets. We had Ratchet1785 send us a tweet that says,
8536000	8543000	Can't wait for the show. I was wondering if you could mention my indie podcast I just started, the Down for Maintenance podcast.
8544000	8546000	Don't worry about it if you can't. Oops, I guess I didn't name it.
8547000	8550000	I just love you guys. I literally had the balls to make one because of you guys. You're the inspiration.
8551000	8555000	Holy shit, that's like the second comment like that in a night. Thank you so much. That's amazing.
8555000	8562000	You didn't give the URL. Where do I find the Down for Maintenance podcast? I'll have to Google it or search for it in the iTunes stores.
8563000	8567000	But there you go. There's your shout out and I'll check it out soon. So, congrats.
8568000	8573000	Now, I'm wondering, there's a very similarly named Warcraft themed show, just throwing it out there.
8574000	8576000	The Realm Maintenance podcast, just throwing it out there.
8577000	8581000	So, the Down for Maintenance. I wonder if that's an MMO related show then.
8582000	8583000	You need to tell me more about it.
8586000	8588000	But there's your plug. Your early plug.
8589000	8593000	Let's see. Again, 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype. OrangeLunchRadio.
8594000	8597000	I saw some calls coming in but I was mid-tweet, so sorry I didn't get them.
8598000	8600000	Let's see. SSJ100Matt sends a tweet.
8601000	8607000	I know you guys love your Disney, but what do you get when you mix Power Rangers and Mickey Mouse with friends?
8608000	8610000	I don't know. What do you get when you mix all that together?
8610000	8617000	Apparently, he links us to a story. Bondai's official YouTube channel. I thought we saw something like this previously.
8618000	8620000	But the news article stated this week, so maybe it was something else.
8621000	8629000	But anyway, a teaser is up on Bondai's official YouTube channel promoting the upcoming Chogatai King Mickey combiner set.
8630000	8632000	And this looks awesome here. I'm going to play a little YouTube here.
8633000	8635000	This is a long YouTube. Let's see if we can...
8635000	8644000	So yes, look at these little Mickey robots. And then they're going to come together to form that. That's kind of awesome actually.
8645000	8646000	That's a fun looking Gestalt.
8647000	8650000	Looks like a Mickey and a Daisy and a Donald.
8651000	8654000	Mickey meets Voltron. Dun dun dun.
8655000	8658000	Oh here, it's going through all the characters right now. That was Mickey. Minnie. There's Minnie.
8659000	8660000	Is that like Disney group sex?
8660000	8665000	They look like the vital nations or something. There's Donald. Alright, we got calls coming in. Let's try to take another call.
8666000	8667000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
8670000	8672000	Chugga Choo Choo. It's Jim Sally, Rob.
8673000	8674000	Hey, Jim Sally. How you doing, buddy?
8675000	8679000	I'm doing pretty good. I'm happy today. I'm spicy. I'm jolly. I'm jingly.
8680000	8681000	Ho ho ho.
8682000	8684000	Ho ho ho, bitches. I got hoes everywhere today.
8686000	8688000	Tasty hoes. Hey, speaking of hoes, man.
8688000	8702000	Speaking of hoes, man. I remember playing Leisure Suit Larry on my old 386. Remember when you got that first game and you found that prostitute and you take it to the back and you give it to her?
8703000	8710000	And you forgot to buy a condom and then your fucking shit falls off? That's fucking awesome, man. That's a life lesson I took. I still use today, man.
8711000	8715000	I think about Leisure Suit Larry and his shit falling off and I say, fuck man, I shouldn't put something on my shit.
8715000	8720000	He's not making that up either. That actually does happen in the first Leisure Suit Larry game. You know what I remember?
8721000	8722000	What?
8723000	8727000	I think it was the remake of the first, like the first remake of the first Leisure Suit Larry game because Sierra did one.
8728000	8730000	Like the VGA one or whatever? Like in the late early 90s?
8731000	8735000	Yeah, the VGA version. But you had to take a quiz to prove you were 18 or over.
8736000	8739000	That's right. Wasn't that the best? Oh my God. And that was before the internet, really.
8739000	8750000	Cause seriously, we were all 16 and you know, wanting to play and we were smart enough to figure out the questions. It was like playing Jeopardy or something and it's like, instead of like winning money or something, you win boobs!
8751000	8754000	Boobs? I don't even think you had, did they even show a boob in that game? I can't remember.
8755000	8757000	Did they even show us a boob in that game?
8758000	8759000	I think so.
8759000	8770000	You remember at the end, you have to give the girl the apple and she comes out of the hot tub. Oh my God. To this day, to this day, I can't have apples in a hot tub. I can't be in the same room as apples in a hot tub. I can't, man. I can't.
8771000	8779000	Well, I can, but it's not safe for children to see. Like you can't prove you know how. And that's because, you know, Leisure Suit Larry was a great game and it should be remade.
8780000	8787000	It was a game that taught me some life lessons that I needed to learn. And it's, it's, I think a game that should be mandatory for children to play.
8787000	8793000	But didn't you play the Leisure Suit Larry remake or whatever that was on the Xbox 360 like four years ago? It was terrible.
8794000	8803000	Oh, it was terrible. That was totally terrible. I could, every game since the, the first ones were terrible. But I do remember buying, I bought one where it was love for sale, I think, and he was on a cruise ship.
8804000	8814000	And he had the, and he came with a scratching Smith book and as you play the game, you can scratch and sniff shit. Like the lobster smelled horrible. The lobster fucking smelled horrible at the bar. Oh my God.
8814000	8819000	He's not making this up. Like all that shit is totally true. Like there was a scratch and sniff edition. Yeah.
8820000	8823000	Jim Sally doesn't lie, children. I'm always 100% serious.
8824000	8831000	What other classic PC games do you remember? Did you play a lot of other dirty games? There wasn't a lot. Leisure Suit Larry was kind of like the big one. There wasn't a lot of dirty ones.
8832000	8835000	I did play that strip poker a lot, man. You remember the CGA and strip poker? It's fucking old.
8836000	8839000	I do. We talked about that last week. We have it up on the tumbler, the Commodore 64 version.
8839000	8847000	Oh my God. I played that. So I didn't know, I didn't know boobs looked as good as they did until I got older. I thought they were all pixelated and squarier and stuff until I got older.
8848000	8864000	You know what I didn't talk about last week though, but that's totally true. There was a male version of those games too, where the person you were playing with was a man for, you know, all those women out there that, you know, or the, you know, 10% of guys that wanted to, you know, have that version.
8865000	8867000	Women love stud poker.
8867000	8871000	Did you ever play dark soccer? Did you ever play strip poker, the male version?
8872000	8873000	No.
8874000	8877000	Did you ever play the female version? That's fucking hot.
8878000	8881000	I played the we're drunk as hell. We don't know what version we're playing.
8882000	8884000	Oh, that's, that's, that's the beginning of a hot story.
8885000	8887000	Not really because nobody was pretty.
8888000	8889000	That's hot.
8890000	8892000	That's a little different when no one's pretty.
8893000	8895000	Oh girl, everyone's pretty when you're drunk.
8895000	8898000	No, not everyone is pretty when you're drunk.
8899000	8903000	Some of us still maintain our aesthetic sensibilities.
8904000	8920000	Hey, hey, you should grow that hair out, JB. Don't fucking kid yourself. Hey, look, normally Jim Salley is a pretty liberal guy with, and I love everybody, but fuck that shit. Girls are supposed to have long hair and boys are supposed to have short hair. Fuck that shit. Grow your hair out, girl. You deserve it.
8920000	8927000	Look so beautiful with your long hair. Put that shit in a ponytail. Put it in two ponytails. Fuck it. You deserve it. You know what I'm saying? Girl, grow that hair.
8928000	8929000	You're getting fashion advice, Jim Salley.
8930000	8932000	Rob, shut up, man. Cut your hair. It's too fucking long for you, Rob.
8933000	8935000	I have no hair left. I don't know if you've seen pictures of me.
8936000	8939000	I was just reaching back and realizing that my hair actually does not touch my shoulders remotely.
8940000	8941000	It used to be longer.
8942000	8943000	It used to be, and then I cut it all off because I was sick of it.
8944000	8945000	I just got my hair cut today, so.
8946000	8947000	My hair's too curly.
8948000	8949000	I got mine cut on Friday. What's left of it?
8950000	8952000	I always know what they're doing, Jamie. Grow that shit out. You deserve it.
8953000	8956000	She ran to the potty. This call made her throw up. No, I'm kidding.
8957000	8961000	Alright, Jim Salley, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show. Do you have any other final thoughts?
8962000	8968000	Well, before I go, I just want to say, you shouldn't throw your fucking controllers at your kitty cats. You should be nice to them.
8969000	8975000	Please fucking pet them and give them tuna and, you know, let them sleep with you in the bed and stuff. Be nice to your cat.
8975000	8978000	No, no, no, no, no. She's a fucking asshole, Casey. Seriously.
8979000	8980000	Come on.
8981000	8991000	You can be petting her just nicely. You pick her up, pet her, she'll lay in your lap, and then she'll wake up for no apparent reason, walk over, and just start being an asshole.
8992000	8994000	I'm gonna knock everything off the tree. I'm gonna go wake up the baby.
8995000	8999000	You're like, what the fuck? I was just giving you attention, I was being nice, and you're just a fucking asshole.
8999000	9006000	Our cat, we put the cat, like, on the bed, like, I'm not even, like, not in the bed, that's not happening, but we just put the cat on the bed to, like, try and pet the cat.
9007000	9014000	You know what she does? Jumps right off. Runs away. She's like, she's afraid of the comforter. Like, for real, our cat is afraid of the comforter.
9015000	9025000	Our cat used to sleep with us in bed, and she used to sleep on my head, because she, like, you know, laying by me, but, see, we tried that when we moved to the new house, and she just flips her shit.
9025000	9036000	She just goes in the bedroom, and she's just like, oh my god, I'm gonna get into everything. So, she'll get up on the, you know, she'll try to get up on top of the, you know, dresser to jump up onto the window.
9037000	9045000	But she can't do that, because the dresser's too high. So then she'll try climbing up the clothes, and then she'll go upside down on her back, rubbing along the floor, and she'll crawl on the bottom of the bed.
9046000	9052000	Upside down, crawling on the bottom of the bed, and she'll come bite your feet. Because she's an asshole, is why she'll do that.
9052000	9056000	Jim Salley just wants you to treat your pussy well, right?
9057000	9059000	And make sure you declaw your pussy.
9060000	9062000	No, don't declaw your pussy.
9063000	9066000	Declawing is the feline equivalent of ripping out someone's fingernails.
9067000	9068000	Alright, good.
9069000	9071000	I'm not Loki. Loki declawed this cat, I bet.
9072000	9075000	Alright, Jim Salley, I gotta let you go. Have a good one, buddy.
9076000	9077000	Okay, everyone, love your pussies tonight.
9078000	9079000	Alright, will do. Bye.
9080000	9081000	I'm choking.
9083000	9084000	I'm popcorn.
9085000	9088000	That call made me laugh very hard. It's always a good time when Jim Salley calls in.
9089000	9097000	Alright, Xtaphir is saying in the chatroom that I'm plugging other podcasts, but I haven't plugged Hoard House, which is the show that Xtaphir's on.
9098000	9106000	So there you go. A plug for Hoard House. The best Lil Hoard House in Azeroth, or a show we call Hoard House for short, is Wednesdays, premiering on the VoG network.
9106000	9113000	11am Pacific, 2pm Eastern is the premier, and then it's up on the podcast feed Wednesday nights at Hoardhouse.com.
9114000	9120000	Or, of course, VoGnetwork.com if you're reloading it obsessively throughout the week, then you'll see it posted on Wednesday nights.
9121000	9126000	Alright, I think that was it for tweets tonight, too. I think I got them all.
9127000	9131000	That's that. That's it for tweets. Nobody else is calling in.
9132000	9136000	I think that's it for the show. We're done a little early tonight, but you know what, it's a slower news week.
9137000	9142000	DarkSakura has an appointment in the morning she wants to keep, so we're gonna end it up early a little bit tonight.
9143000	9147000	So, that's it. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we say goodnight.
9148000	9149000	Loki, why don't you start us off with your final thought?
9150000	9157000	People need to come play on the Minecraft server. Yes, I know that I can set up a day to have everybody come play, but seriously, there's like zero people in there, other than me.
9158000	9161000	I check the logs. I know there's like nobody playing.
9162000	9169000	And I'm sure partly what that problem was, because one day I left the server off because I was messing with something and forgot to turn it back on.
9170000	9173000	And the permissions were screwed up for a while there.
9174000	9178000	But they're all fixed now. They're pretty much fixed, and the mob arena works okay.
9179000	9183000	It's still really hard, even though I tried tweaking things to make it work better.
9183000	9187000	Apparently that classic bow plugin does not work, I come to find out.
9188000	9193000	But I made it so you can spam fireballs now, and that's kind of fun.
9194000	9197000	You still get your ass kicked though, even though you're throwing tons of fireballs at everything.
9198000	9201000	Those enemies are relentless, and they will just come for you.
9202000	9207000	Alright, and my final thought since I'm being yelled at and chatted about it.
9208000	9212000	You know what, I'm just going to say this. Support all indie podcasting. Support them all.
9213000	9218000	Indie podcasts rock, and a lot of people work very hard for very little money to make podcasts work.
9219000	9222000	And especially, may I call your attention to all the shows that are a part of the VoG network.
9223000	9230000	We have a great lineup of shows, including Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Anime Jokes.
9231000	9235000	JAM Session, Girls Gone Wow, Hoard House, and yes, Bobby Black Wolf.
9236000	9237000	And Thunder Station Live, don't forget them.
9238000	9240000	And Jamie Eats Rob Popcorn, the podcast.
9241000	9244000	You know, I don't remember, I don't think you've produced five episodes of that yet.
9248000	9251000	Alright, did I get your final thought, Dark Soccer? I don't think we have yet.
9252000	9253000	Dark Soccer, your final thought.
9254000	9255000	Candy Cane Jojo's.
9256000	9257000	Mojo Jojo's?
9258000	9259000	No, Jojo's.
9259000	9263000	So as I said, support indie podcasting. Thank you for downloading and supporting OLR.
9264000	9265000	We couldn't do this show without you guys.
9266000	9268000	I know it's been a crazy week. Thanks for sticking with us.
9269000	9273000	And hope we were able to entertain you for a couple hours tonight talking about video games.
9274000	9275000	We will be back next week to do it all over again.
9276000	9277000	I don't think we're taking any time off for the holidays.
9278000	9282000	I think we're maybe in two weeks if Alan and I end up going out of town.
9283000	9284000	But I don't know, we'll see.
9285000	9288000	So for now, we'll be back next week to do it all again.
9289000	9291000	Thanks for downloading OLR. Tell a friend or two or ten about the show.
9292000	9293000	Help us spread the word. That's all we got.
9294000	9297000	We'll be back for episode 487 next week. Until then, goodnight.
9319000	9321000	See you next week.
9349000	9351000	See you next week.
