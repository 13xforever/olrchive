14386	25121	December 16, 2012, Wii Homebrew Channel is now running on the Wii U, Microsoft lifts a ban on their Windows Store, and one MMO announces they will end subscription fees.
31653	36535	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36575	44177	It is Orange Lounge Radio live for this, our 486th episode, December the 16th, 2012.
44617	52240	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and so forth with my co-hosts.
52400	56421	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56861	60603	I am a happy, blissful person right now because I have JoJo's and coffee.
61562	65344	Now, I made you explain this on Bobby Blackwell's show, so you gotta explain it here too.
65404	67465	What exactly are JoJo's, for those that don't know?
67485	69987	They're like Oreos, except they're the Trader Joe's brands.
70067	78212	They actually, I think, taste a little bit better than regular Oreos, but these have like a candy cane filling in them, so they are basically chocolate mint cookies.
78512	79773	Candy canes are great, just saying.
79793	83074	They are, and I put a picture, I think, of the box in the chat room, but I can do it again.
83535	85536	I put one up on our site, but I'll link a picture in the chat room.
85896	89400	Trader Joe's is like the best bachelor shopping store ever.
92304	96689	I'm not just for that audience, obviously, but it's a great place to shop.
96950	102757	Well, I mean, the thing that I like about it is that you can get really healthy, good food for relatively inexpensive.
102797	105480	We actually spend less going to Trader Joe's than we do at the regular grocery store.
105874	108579	Now careful, they're not paying us to endorse them, so we don't want to go too far.
108639	113068	And I will tell you something, if you happen to be someone who eats kosher, it actually is a good place to get kosher meat.
113228	113609	There you go.
114911	116053	And Hanukkah's all over, right?
116434	117316	You partied it away?
118467	121109	Hanukkah ended at nightfall today.
121390	121690	Oh, okay.
122070	123852	Because it's eight days and it started last Saturday.
124052	124272	Right.
124312	126054	I always forget like the sundown thing kind of.
126614	126754	Yeah.
127115	132840	I'm going, this is a way that I tell people how to remember what days are for, you know, Jewish calendar.
134962	138004	In Genesis it says, and the night and the day were the first day.
138325	139906	So night today is the first day.
140529	141450	Don't get all preachy.
141650	147294	I'm just saying that that's why it's translated that way, and that's how it helps me remember that it's at nightfall.
147995	155421	Say hello to Tech Master Loki, who will preach the gospel of hacking here on the show.
155601	157342	No, I don't know.
157642	162366	If I'm going to endorse anything, I'm going to endorse the ultimate breakfast set, Lumberjacks.
164466	167527	The ultimate breakfast is fantastic.
167587	168707	It does live up to its name.
169128	169408	It is.
170408	173128	Two pieces of French toast.
173429	174129	That's the side.
174149	175229	That comes on a separate plate.
176189	176849	The main plate.
177109	178610	This is where the fun happens.
178830	180030	You get your choice of potatoes.
180110	185911	So I got country potatoes with cheese and green onions on it.
186772	187692	A half pound of ham.
188852	193115	Four sausages, four strips of bacon, and eggs.
193335	194156	Welcome to America.
195016	195517	America!
196797	201921	And what's great about the bacon, you know, most places I have to go, hey, can you cook the bacon crispy?
202341	205143	This shit comes out, it's perfect.
205503	210146	It is just like, you can hear the snap of the bacon when you break it.
210306	211207	It's fantastic.
211327	213469	And it's so much food, you can't eat it all at once.
213609	218012	I mean, I eat a lot of food sometimes, but that's like a meal for a few days.
218813	219941	and many more.
221616	237188	And one of these days, because I was looking at it, I thought about bringing it today, but they have this burger that they take, it's basically one of those burgers, like, they will take a picture of you when you order this burger because the burger is huge.
237508	238749	It's like the size of my laptop.
239849	240010	Wow.
240030	242752	Oh, is that the place that, well, did you hear about the pizza burger thing?
243292	247275	Yeah, I've seen that in, like, Japan or China or something like that.
247595	249937	Yeah, but is it, so is it, like, the same thing, like, that big?
250504	252705	Yeah, it's giant.
252765	257327	It's a one-pound burger, and then all the other stuff.
257487	269952	It doesn't just have to be American dishes, though, because there's a faux place that Alan and I like to go to that's just up the street, not that far, because they're open super late, like till 1 a.m., and it's such better late-night food than Denny's, right?
270293	275835	But they do this thing called the Faux King Challenge, where it's like this gigantic... That's that place we went to...
276095	276515	Oh, that's right.
276535	277797	We have to go there on Christmas Eve.
277817	279218	Yeah, we do our little Christmas Day.
279238	279698	Christmas Day.
279718	280699	We have to do it on Christmas Day.
280919	282240	It's fucking great.
282260	285443	Yeah, and I think the place is called, like, the Foe King or something.
285583	286384	No, that's not the name.
287064	289046	You eat your Foe King food.
289146	297954	Yeah, but it's the Foe King Challenge, and it's got, like, this gigantic bowl of foe with, like, two pounds of meat and two pounds of noodles.
297974	298854	Like, it's insane.
299275	302818	Like, we look at all the pictures on the wall of people who've ordered it, and it's like, oh, my gosh.
303291	303591	You know what?
303651	305113	I think I should do the phoking challenge.
306474	307194	I don't think you can.
307234	308536	I think that's like two pounds of pork.
309516	310277	I don't know if you can.
311598	314341	You might have to beg for forgiveness.
314421	319865	You know, since they're bringing up Epic Mealtime in chat, I did watch Epic Chef this week, which is fantastic, by the way.
320506	322307	I mean, that needs to be on the Food Network.
322588	325090	It's kind of a cross between Epic Mealtime and Chopped.
326050	353068	which is great and then you know they present one of the ingredients is a suitcase of bacon because that's just you know the most unusual quantity of bacon ever a suitcase but one of the things about Epic Meal Time is they have a cookbook and the cookbook is actually in the quantities that they make it on the show so it's like okay this dish requires 25 pounds of bacon and you know five pounds of beef and whatever it's fantastic
353450	357979	Speaking of which, my Secret Santa got me four pounds of bacon and that's fantastic.
357999	360905	My Secret Santa is my co-worker and he knows that I love bacon.
363782	364102	Let's see.
364342	365763	Alan Alchemy is in our chat room.
366443	370365	And I always say the fourth guest on our show is you guys live in our chat room.
370626	376629	We do tape live every Sunday night at vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
376729	385754	If you happen to be listening live, participate with us in the chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where Alan Alchemy says it's actually called Faux Bac Viet or something like that.
386434	391037	Yes, thank you for just giving away where we lived to all the listeners because I just said it was right up the street.
391377	392077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
418452	422005	Um, but, uh, their food is amazing, seriously.
422025	423872	If you're ever up in this area, go eat their pho.
424798	425999	It's fokin' good!
449220	456607	Horrible, horrible events that happened on Friday and just this unimaginable tragedy that happened in a school in Connecticut.
456907	463734	I can't wrap my fucking mind around how awful what happened is.
463814	466416	It is unexplainable.
466576	469119	The madness behind what happened is truly unexplainable.
469759	469879	Yeah.
469919	470059	Yes.
470099	470219	Yes.
496047	498689	Who went on his Facebook and said, dude, it's not me, leave me alone.
498929	499509	Yeah, right?
499709	507154	So, you know, but that didn't stop hordes of people from, because the media had already tried and convicted Ryan Lanza.
508274	514918	They didn't stop people from going on his Facebook, finding all these things he liked because, you know, people want to get inside the killer's mind.
514958	519661	They want to be inside the mind, like what drives this person to madness and to do such terrible, terrible things.
519941	522022	and so, you know, oh, blame the video games.
522402	528606	And so, Ryan had liked a video game that we here at OLR ourselves like, Mass Effect.
528986	529626	And what happens?
529666	542433	The Mass Effect page gets filled up with all this, you've got blood on your hands, you made a game that is responsible for this event happening and da-da-da-da-da and all these really, really
543786	563287	Just jump to conclusions things and just hateful things and I understand that in times of tragedy we want to like wrap our heads around and find a reason like why and how could this happen and how could we prevent it from happening again and all this but that doesn't really excuse mob mentality.
563829	564389	No, it doesn't.
580259	583962	Video games I know and things that have horrific imagery.
584302	586123	Does Mass Effect have some bad stuff?
586584	588685	Yeah, but is it the worst I've ever seen?
588965	590226	Not by any stretch of the imagination.
590246	592628	That ending, the original ending, it drove them to madness.
592648	595510	I actually have to share something with you that someone posted on Tumblr.
595650	596151	Sure, go ahead.
596351	601214	I reposted it on my Mass Effect Tumblr just saying, no one plays Mass Effect and says, whoa, this is violence.
601314	603116	It's really inflaming my inner serial killer.
603196	604617	No, they play Mass Effect and then they cry.
606017	606478	Absolutely.
606778	608218	It's emotion.
608278	613260	You make a lot of decisions about what's the way to react here.
613360	615261	And you can play the third one with no combat.
615481	618902	If you make bad decisions, you will suffer for those decisions.
619002	622524	It's not just kill for no reason like other games like, let's say...
623084	625226	or Postal or whatever.
625266	631390	And I'm not necessarily pointing the finger at those games and saying, these games are the reason that this happened.
631430	633411	Because that's not true either.
633431	638355	But he liked Grand Theft Auto and the funny physics cars, which I happen to love as well.
638915	641696	Are they the falsely accused killer or the real one?
641796	642496	I don't know somebody.
643216	648537	See, the thing is, I don't personally don't really care about what he was thinking.
648997	649597	I don't care.
650137	650918	I don't think that way.
650978	651918	I don't want to think that way.
651978	653518	I don't want to understand that kind of thought.
654058	663060	What I want is for people who have those mental issues to get treatment instead of, you know, hospitals losing their funding and putting crazies back on the street.
664821	666102	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
682971	687753	Yes, but I mean, there's obviously, you know, what drove him to it and so forth.
687773	688754	There's no easy answer.
689174	704181	This is the problem is that I don't think necessarily we'll ever be able to explain what drives a person to do something like that because the rest of us are rational people and we don't think irrationally like this person did in this scenario.
704581	710564	Like, that's a good thing that we're not capable of getting inside that man's head, right?
710584	710664	Yeah.
711424	717046	We shouldn't be able to know that because that's a dark, dark, dark place.
718406	719966	If I can reference one other thing.
720306	720466	Sure.
720747	733010	There's an article written that's on the Huffington Post that's been floating around about a woman who has a child who has... They don't know what exactly is wrong with him, but it causes him to lie and lash out and do very violent things.
733310	737071	Things that they're saying that he has in common with the gunman.
739172	745996	But they said that they can't do anything for him until he does something that gets him convicted.
747197	750018	There's no public mental health to take care of that kind of thing.
750318	752880	They don't treat them until they've committed a crime.
753359	754660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
776376	784641	And if you don't believe me, why don't I play a clip from you from one of the major news networks that a lot of people watch on the day of the shooting.
784721	786182	This is a clip from Fox News.
794380	796703	I want to point out, Ryan was 24 years old.
797003	797303	Adam was 20.
798184	803591	So this was still during that whole time where, yes, the media was perpetuating false information.
804031	806474	But again, we're looking for that reason.
806514	808156	We need to point our finger at something to blame.
809253	811495	I don't think it's coincidental at all.
811516	813638	I think we've got to look at these forces that
832408	839310	Empower people to get some knowledge through the internet and support, but there are a lot of dehumanizing forces that come with that.
839951	842652	Reality TV is no friend of preventing such things.
843172	846433	Facebook is no friend of preventing such things, I have to say.
847033	855116	And I think we're at a time again, and we mentioned this earlier, we've now pushed the red line of the unthinkable into kindergarten classrooms.
857347	862371	So if you're a 20 year old male and you play online games, look out.
863112	865594	And you like Facebook, look out.
867777	871781	It's basically old people just saying, things we don't understand.
871801	873563	They're causing the problems in this world.
873623	883973	Damn that rock music and those comic books and the television and the skateboarding and those things that the children like.
883993	885654	I mean, that's basically what it sounds like to me.
885695	887216	And then we call it Fox News.
887256	888277	Fox News is stupid.
888597	891140	In the same breath, today...
892612	892772	Wake up!
921013	921974	What can we do about it?
922794	936965	I think what we need to do is show the world that there's a lot of rationally thinking professional people that happen to play video games and watch movies responsibly because we're responsible people.
937125	939446	Rob, 20 years, it's going to be something else.
940447	940807	DarkSakura.com
959147	965215	The whole point is that, and I'm really trying not to get political.
965776	967338	I know, you're showing great restraint.
967498	973626	But they need to start looking into the people themselves who do this, not just...
974287	984792	You know, and also, I'm very irritated that they're trying to bring up that this guy had some form of autism, which I know plenty of people who are high-functioning autistic who have zero.
985212	986993	What he did is the act of a sociopath.
987173	987974	Or Asperger's.
988294	990935	Like, how quick were they to try and say that this guy had that?
990955	993416	And I don't know if we really know that or not at this point.
993436	994017	I'm going to tell you when...
994517	995218	DarkSakura.com
1015638	1032337	for example uh you know there would be how one person would look at this and then say oh the poor parents oh let's blame someone a person with Asperger's would more likely be like what caused this where can we get to the root of the problem how can we make sure this doesn't happen again that's the difference instead of you know and and I know like I said I know plenty of people
1033078	1042028	But the thing that they need to really look at is that this person had something that went wrong in his head that made him snap.
1042709	1044792	And look at it too, there's a little bit more in that.
1045773	1047014	One of the people he killed was his mother.
1047955	1049556	What was going on between him and his mother?
1050136	1051236	What was going on at home?
1051917	1056038	What was the situation that formed this person that led them to that?
1056078	1058279	Because a person is not just what they play.
1058739	1063041	A person is a collection of all the experiences that has made them who they are.
1063541	1065742	Perhaps he had some sort of form of autism.
1065762	1068343	Perhaps he had some sort of behavioral disorder.
1068403	1073305	There are times where sociopaths who grow up become very, very good liars.
1074225	1077427	and they can pretend to be like everybody else.
1077527	1086093	They can maybe look like they have a disassociative disorder when instead they really don't have that same emotional connect to other people.
1086153	1087554	They don't feel that way to other people.
1087594	1088114	They don't care.
1089075	1092777	And no amount of therapy is ever going to change the brain of a sociopath.
1093017	1094078	They need to be taken off the streets.
1096771	1097792	It's a tough situation.
1097852	1100213	This is a question that's not going to be answered for a long time.
1100253	1113822	The point and why I wanted to bring this up, however, is that I'm just, I don't, because I'm a gamer and this person who did the unthinkable is, I guess, being paid as a gamer, although we don't even really know if he was or not yet.
1115443	1118905	I do not appreciate being put in the same bucket as this guy.
1118985	1119345	Do you?
1119365	1119405	No.
1124190	1131818	I'm a professional person with a professional job who's done the same thing for like 11 years and, you know, has run this podcast for 10 years and so forth.
1131878	1138345	And, you know, I'm a mature when appropriate individual that happens to enjoy video games.
1138805	1140047	Does that make me a bad person?
1142478	1144360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1162557	1167859	But the whole point, don't come at it with an emotional reaction to it.
1168320	1170921	Come to this with logic and rationality.
1171801	1172842	Have your facts ready.
1173502	1178184	You know, talk to the ECA, the Electronic Consumers Association.
1178644	1189029	The ECA is probably one of the single best resources for information, statistical information, that's going to combat anything that faux news or anybody can throw at you.
1190367	1193449	And by the way, don't just write off Fox News.
1193949	1196351	There are people out there who believe everything that comes off of them.
1196391	1197211	My mother is one of them.
1197251	1201034	Well, and it's not even, like, almost every news station.
1201614	1207277	I think NPR was the only one who didn't peg the wrong person in the beginning.
1207397	1211180	It's not just, like, I just happen to have that clip because I stole it from Game Politics.
1211240	1211480	Thanks.
1212561	1215703	But it's not specific to that particular news network.
1215763	1226411	I mean, no matter where your political leanings are, how you feel about certain stations or what have you, misinformation was everywhere this week, including Facebook, including Twitter and all of that stuff.
1227032	1230915	So as we try to find a reason for the unthinkable.
1233450	1238473	Anyhow, I don't mean to stray too far from what is supposed to be a light-hearted escape topic.
1238553	1239713	We do play video games.
1239893	1240874	Yes, I am a gamer.
1241294	1244436	Games are what I play to escape the world for a little bit.
1244756	1252160	Just like a lot of you guys watch movies or TV shows or roleplay or draw, paint.
1253100	1255241	Read comics, whatever it is.
1255361	1265466	A lot of these things are ways to break out of the quote-unquote real world for a little while when all this crazy crap's going on.
1265626	1267907	And seriously, look at history.
1268027	1272869	Back in the 1500s, are you familiar with the term called the Bonfire of the Vanities?
1273610	1274410	I remember the movie.
1275484	1287695	The bonfire of the vanities were when religious groups were going around saying that the modern stream of art in the early renaissance was responsible for debauchery and, I mean, come on, we're dealing with the de Medici's who were half popes and half killing off their relatives.
1288356	1295682	You know, who were saying that all of this opulence and grandeur was a result of the artists and the music at the time, so they were going out and burning paintings.
1296603	1299464	Well, is this much different than, you know, what happened then?
1299604	1304586	Instead of that, they're looking for another scapegoat and they're banning things and preventing them from being, you know, released.
1305106	1309027	We had the same thing with the records being played backwards in the 70s and 80s.
1310027	1312128	I mean, this is history.
1312168	1313068	Why don't we fucking learn?
1313108	1314909	John Lennon was a Satanist, totally, remember?
1316582	1319825	Why don't we just look at our history and finally fucking learn something?
1321206	1327010	Porkchop in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, soon there'll be t-shirts saying, games don't kill people.
1327490	1338919	You know, funny enough, the ECA was giving out shirts at E3 or PAX or one of those expos, and it has a picture of the various controllers, and it says, contrary to popular belief, these things do not make me a killer.
1339319	1339900	Love that shirt.
1340180	1340740	I have mine.
1340800	1341561	I need to fix the shoulder.
1341601	1342141	Love that shirt.
1342381	1343741	I've repaired that shirt like twice.
1344022	1357387	K Sarasara in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, I do wonder about the impact on a person who solely plays violent video games for a disproportionate number of hours a day, specifically high consumers with social disorders.
1357967	1386989	and you know what you said the key word social disorder well and the fact that you know you solely play violent video games for a disproportionate that implies that that person doesn't know when to put the controller down and needs like a teenager a young adult or a child that's where the parents need to step in and watch what their kids are playing and make sure it's not a disproportionate amount you know that's I think where somebody else has to step in and say you know enough turn off the TV
1388616	1390997	And I know I've brought this up before.
1392037	1404643	There was an episode of Penn & Teller Bullshit where they took a seven-year-old and then a former, I think he was a former Marine, and the kid loved playing first-person shooters.
1404683	1407184	He was really good at it, and the Marine was a player too.
1407644	1410925	Took him out to a firing range and had him shoot off three rounds of a semi-automatic gun.
1411626	1414867	The kid busted out in tears and said he never wanted to look at a gun again.
1415877	1416978	That would be me right there.
1417659	1418441	I don't like guns.
1418561	1419502	I don't want to touch a gun.
1419662	1421465	Well, I'll do the carnival.
1422587	1423568	Or light guns.
1423768	1425611	Duck Hunt is about as gun as I'm going to get.
1425691	1426513	I like target shooting.
1427334	1429457	It doesn't mean that I want to turn it on a person.
1429717	1430599	I like point blank.
1431339	1437421	And for example, a friend of mine, more like an acquaintance, was doing an inspection at a home.
1438141	1440421	And a homeless guy came in and charged her and she shot him.
1441182	1443362	And she got away and he probably would have attacked her.
1444162	1448484	But even after that, she was sitting in her car hyperventilating for having wounded somebody.
1450004	1452585	Having a gun doesn't make you a killer.
1452625	1453685	Being a killer makes you a killer.
1454264	1456405	I want to move on and get back into video games.
1456846	1459807	It was a topic that had to be brought up, though, so thank you guys for sitting through it.
1459868	1460628	Really appreciate it.
1461008	1465631	If you have some, you know, put-together thoughts on it, you want to email us, mailbag at orangelantradio.com.
1465751	1469694	We will take phone calls later in the show if you are brave enough to bring it up live here on the show.
1470534	1472535	But we do have a lot of video gaming topics we want to get to.
1472615	1476838	I want to close with you guys, the listeners, with some final comments here in our chat room.
1477619	1481241	Ksarocera, with another good line here, I think it's like a buffet.
1481761	1484683	Nobody should only consume one thing all the time.
1484703	1486565	I think that's a good thought.
1488907	1489807	This is a great picture.
1491969	1493650	This is the contrary to popular opinion.
1493690	1494611	These do not make me a killer.
1494871	1495892	Well, except maybe the Wiimote.
1495912	1496633	That shit's dangerous.
1498935	1500696	It's kind of like the shirt, but yeah.
1501336	1504299	I'm going to give Immortal King the last word on this because I think this quote's great.
1505480	1507081	I remember a saying from my teacher.
1507681	1510964	If we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.
1511326	1515390	DarkSakura, what video games have you been playing?
1515430	1517252	I played Mass Effect for eight hours yesterday.
1517272	1520354	What was that line about nobody should consume one thing all the time?
1533536	1543080	I was sitting in my pajamas with a headache and not feeling well all day, so I sat back and played all the Mass Effect I wanted, and it was glorious.
1544941	1545681	Glorious.
1545761	1547522	And most of it actually wasn't combat, just saying.
1547842	1552523	I will tell you, though, if I had to consume one thing all the time, it would probably be these JoJo's with the candy cane.
1552543	1555124	You would be so anemic and just... And fat.
1555245	1555945	I would be very, very fat.
1555965	1560427	You would be like, what's that character from Adventure Time, the princess, the glob princess?
1560847	1561027	Yes.
1561647	1561907	Loki!
1562427	1562507	Loki!
1591957	1592197	Far Cry 3
1605611	1608033	Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 2
1634290	1634734	Thanks for watching!
1637628	1647370	For some reason, like on Wednesday, I noticed when we were playing Black Ops 2 System Link that it says what our NAT settings are in the bottom right-hand corner.
1647590	1649390	And usually it's strict.
1649470	1660992	You always would get the, you know, when you log in live or do a network test or something like that, it'd say, you know, your NAT settings are too strict that you may be limited to what games you connect to and that kind of stuff.
1661432	1663153	But for some reason, it said open.
1663573	1665593	I was like, wait, that's odd.
1666273	1668336	Why is it doing that?
1668416	1669277	Why does it say open?
1669337	1670418	It's supposed to be strict.
1670578	1671519	That's really strange.
1672660	1673601	So I didn't think much of it.
1674162	1680849	And then the next day, I think we played Black Ops 2 again, and it said open again.
1680869	1681110	I was like...
1681830	1682311	That's odd.
1682331	1684073	I wonder what's going on here.
1684473	1687257	So I'm like, hey, you want to try playing Grand Theft Auto?
1687937	1690160	And so we played some Grand Theft Auto.
1690340	1690921	No disconnects.
1690941	1692883	We played Grand Theft Auto again later that day.
1693364	1693984	No disconnects.
1694645	1698950	I left it on from my morning to lunch for a good three hours.
1699331	1700192	Nothing disconnected.
1700632	1701353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1713786	1714686	What the fuck is going on?
1714726	1716747	This is unheard of.
1717088	1718148	So we've been playing Grand Theft Auto.
1718168	1727092	We're probably going to go back to it now, assuming the network stays the way it is, which I am so excited about that because I missed Grand Theft Auto so much.
1728133	1734916	So we're going to hopefully be getting into more episodes from Liberty City Deathmatch again because I need to get back up in the rank charts.
1734976	1735676	I fell down to 120 because...
1737878	1738618	I haven't played in a while.
1739418	1740759	So I need to get back up there.
1740779	1742120	I need to break 60 again.
1744341	1751445	Ironically, though, we played so much of the non-ranked deathmatch that I'm number five in the world.
1752325	1753746	So that was kind of fun.
1753946	1755106	You're number five in the world?
1755627	1757508	Yeah, but it's a non-ranked deathmatch.
1758528	1763491	It just means we've played it so much that we've earned so much money that we're number five in the world.
1763651	1765492	Actually, my coworkers are in the top 20.
1766592	1776299	Um, but yeah, and ranked deathmatch though on Ballad of Gay Tony, I was up to like in the sixties out of the, you know, 200,000 people playing.
1777179	1778300	Um, so that's pretty good.
1779120	1780621	And then, um, what else did I play?
1780641	1782823	I'll play a little bit more Minecraft.
1782883	1784724	I've been fixing some of the stuff.
1785084	1792169	Um, I've been actually trying to go around the just updated spout craft, um, which is a different client you can use.
1792189	1792229	Um,
1792649	1793830	Can you shoot the Slenderman?
1809659	1813460	You can make the Slender Man appear, but you can make those happen.
1813840	1816501	Although those are part of Flan's mod, which he's supposed to be working on.
1816521	1825544	He's done with school right now, so now he's going to be updating his mod for 1.45, which should be done by Christmas, he says.
1826524	1827964	I'm hoping to add that in there.
1828084	1830405	Plus, that client runs a little bit better.
1831306	1832147	Thanks for watching!
1849668	1858254	They have a Core i7 model and what I'm doing is I'm going to actually pop the i5 chip out of it and put an i7 in there that I know it will run.
1858994	1863637	And also going to double the RAM in there so I have 8 gigs of RAM.
1863897	1865858	Because that's all I can really update on it.
1866218	1872302	And also going to reset the heat sink on it because...
1872922	1894550	it gets really hot and it's just because the thermal paste is crap so i'm gonna put some arctic silver mx4 on there and uh hope for the best because i've done all the cooling mods i can on this thing other than like throwing a bunch of copper inside there and who knows it may end up doing that too so um so that's i think that's all i've played this week um
1896443	1899064	Yeah, that was it.
1899204	1900965	Believe it or not, I played some new games this week.
1900985	1901505	A couple of them.
1902626	1902826	No.
1903046	1903546	I know, right?
1903746	1905687	I did not touch Mass Effect at all this week.
1906007	1906927	I know, shock and awe, right?
1906987	1908288	Not even multiplayer on Part 3.
1909508	1915111	I did play, on the PlayStation Vita, I played DJ Max Technica Tune, right?
1915151	1917592	A lot of you music game fans have been excited about this one.
1918252	1918972	It's out on the Vita.
1919032	1920573	You can download it in the shop.
1920593	1922894	So I just did the downloaded version because I guess the...
1923554	1927720	I don't know.
1927740	1928741	I didn't get on that bandwagon.
1928761	1929342	I was like, fuck it.
1929362	1930143	I'll just do the download.
1931445	1939015	Once I learned about the whole thing where you can back up all the files to the PlayStation 3 or the PC so I don't have to keep downloading them every time, I was like, I'll just download it.
1939355	1941478	Even though I only have an 8-gig card in there, I'll figure it out.
1942119	1945383	Um, so yeah, DJ Max Technica Tune.
1945904	1948748	Um, pretty good use of the Vita because it's a touch game, right?
1949088	1951652	Very similar to Elite Beat Agents, except there's no stylus.
1951672	1952593	You kind of use your finger.
1953094	1956619	Um, the bar goes along the bottom and then it comes back along the top.
1956659	1958582	So it's kind of like, imagine like a racetrack.
1959082	1976113	and as the little bar goes around the racetrack you have to touch the little dots in tune with the music but sometimes you drag them sometimes there are multiple taps in the same place even though the bar might still be moving so you have to like you might have to do little taps that are kind of disjointed a little bit so it makes it weird to hold
1976753	1982238	and then special to this version because it is the PlayStation Vita, they do the backtapping.
1982658	1985600	Good news about the backtapping, it's not in a specific place.
1985740	1994047	You just have to tap the back because that would be like impossible because the backtap is really hard sometimes to hold the controller and do it that way but you can just kind of tap anywhere.
1995248	2001293	So you can do the backtaps in that mode although actually the backtap is only in one particular mode.
2001313	2004095	There's like an easy mode which I think is the pop mixing and
2004335	2006378	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2019854	2038746	and uh the song list you know i haven't really been following the dj max series i didn't really play i mean i saw a few of them on the playstation portable uh i played the arcade version of dj max a couple times like i remember the song flee but that's not in the game uh it's it's more of a new song list
2039666	2042628	It's a pretty diverse song list, obviously very heavy on the K-pop.
2042788	2056155	No, there's no Gangnam Style, but since a lot of people are into K-pop right now thanks to that song, and I know a lot of you guys that were music game fans were probably into this style of music before, there's a lot of that style of music here that won't disappoint.
2056715	2060998	Like five songs from the band Step, who's like this Korean girl pop group.
2061798	2077126	Very bright, very vibrant, lots of bright background videos, music videos that are very, very bright, especially because this is kind of a girl band and those types of videos tend to be very bright and poppy and happy.
2077826	2080487	There's lots of visuals in there that kind of can entrance you.
2081728	2085670	And sometimes the background videos can be a little bit distracting from the notes sometimes.
2086050	2087451	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2104405	2128162	and you know in this day and age you're spoiled by 99 cent iPhone games and so forth so the value is really tough to justify but you know there's like 60 some odd songs in the game and I keep unlocking stuff and I've been having fun with it you know as a music game fan there hasn't really been a music game I've been into in a long time you know Beatmania 2DX kind of like stopped a
2128922	2151171	and um I hadn't imported those games in the longest time anyway so it hasn't been a whole lot for me to get really excited about lately so DJ Max is a nice little this is a music game that that doesn't feel like the same old shit I've been playing for a long time it's not falling notes hitting the bar at the bottom like it's something a little different it's something that could really only be done on the Vita as well as it is um
2152131	2155432	I think it's a worthy purchase if you're a music game fan and a Vita owner.
2155512	2162534	But again, that $45 price tag, it's a tough pill to swallow when you sit it next to iPhone.
2162554	2177978	This is why a lot of people are saying the iPhone and the iPad and iOS is really hurting PlayStation Vita and 3DS because those games are this much money and we can download decent games for 99 cents on iOS.
2177998	2178138	Yeah.
2180649	2184270	There you go.
2185770	2190851	So Shane's yelling at me because the band is Cara, not Step.
2190911	2193011	Step is their song that I keep thinking of.
2193512	2195512	And yells at me saying this review fails.
2195672	2199933	Well, technically there is a band named Steps, isn't there?
2200693	2201533	I think there was.
2202073	2205754	They did some stuff for DDR, Euromix, I want to say.
2205954	2206114	Mm-hmm.
2207594	2210336	But I'm not giving it a bad review.
2210396	2218442	I'm just saying the price tag is a tough pill to swallow next to $0.99, $1.99, iPad, iOS games.
2218922	2219863	That's the reality.
2220403	2234993	So I may not be as in touch with the music games as I used to be, but if I'm having a hard time swallowing a lot of this stuff, what do you think about the general public who really has to be able to buy this game in order for it to be very successful?
2235594	2236294	Just saying.
2237575	2240436	So I played DJ Max Technica, which I did enjoy overall.
2260080	2264283	When you die, you got to go chase down your body, except now your body is another zombie.
2264583	2265604	That whole thing is there.
2266004	2268486	A lot of heavy influence from that series.
2269466	2272428	But I got to say, they do the Wii U peripheral and all that stuff very well.
2272889	2282475	Like just the way they integrate the second screen, like a little scanner device that you use to kind of scan the room around you and also be an illuminating light.
2283836	2287098	When you have a sniper rifle, you can use it to zoom in on zombies and so forth.
2287838	2290961	Just kind of neat the way they integrate the Wii U controller.
2291081	2293843	They almost do it better than Nintendo Land, which is a little weird.
2294203	2296665	The problem with Zombie U is it's not going to be for everybody.
2296725	2297645	It's a mature title.
2297966	2298586	It's zombies.
2298626	2300628	Not everybody is into the zombie scary stuff.
2301488	2308313	But if you're willing to sit down and spend some time with it, it's a good launch title.
2308373	2314357	It's a really solid launch title that really shows off the system almost better than some of the first party games do, I gotta say.
2315058	2315198	So...
2316899	2318440	I haven't spent enough time with it.
2318561	2320482	I still need to touch the multiplayer mode.
2320862	2326406	I hear there's a lot of Nintendo Network influence, like you find your friends' zombies are out there in the world or whatever.
2326907	2337355	But just to give you an example, you will be out in the world doing your thing, and then if you get bitten by a zombie, you're dead.
2338035	2341076	You're reborn as another survivor, basically.
2341336	2344338	Like another survivor is discovered and you show up in the safe house.
2344658	2349980	If you want to go get your stuff, you have to go find your old self and kill yourself, basically, and steal the bag.
2350800	2353021	And so it's... I like that.
2353101	2353462	It's neat.
2353562	2356303	But it was seen before in Demon's Souls.
2356723	2360305	But maybe Ubisoft's kind of banking on maybe a lot of people didn't play that or...
2361665	2364726	I don't know, there's lots of Zelda knockoffs out there in the world.
2364766	2366086	Why not a Demon's Souls knockoff?
2366106	2366646	It was a good game.
2367366	2370567	Also, that same insane high level of difficulty.
2371107	2373048	But I do have to hand it to the developers team.
2373468	2379569	As much as I say, oh, it's Demon's Souls with zombies, the way they integrate the Wii U device is great.
2380069	2385831	So, I mean, it is a game that you can really say can only be done on the Wii U. So, they did a good job of that.
2386451	2386631	Zombie U
2410020	2410260	Yeah?
2410620	2412180	What possessed you to do that project?
2412220	2415661	Well, originally it was because I was going to have it for Josh's first birthday party.
2415821	2420282	I was going to have that as a centerpiece or something.
2420582	2433385	I just didn't finish it because the design that I was working off of, the way they had it come together, I mean, it made sense if you're doing a 3D model because the pieces clipped into each other.
2434705	2438667	But in the real world, you can't just phase an object through something else.
2440388	2443629	You need to actually have it attach to one surface to the other.
2444310	2446811	So I had to tweak the model and make it work.
2447291	2449752	And it was a little bit more difficult and time-consuming.
2450313	2453094	But now it's done, and it looks somewhat good.
2453114	2454154	I don't know, it looks neat.
2455555	2456355	People are like, what's that?
2456736	2457576	It did look neat.
2457596	2458497	I saw the pictures on Twitter.
2458517	2459257	It looked pretty awesome.
2459557	2460217	Yeah, it's pretty big.
2460457	2460858	Congrats.
2461860	2462100	All right.
2462660	2463261	That's going to do it.
2463401	2467503	Oh, one other thing I will mention just in a very candid way since you talked about pinball.
2468344	2470024	I played a theater of magic machine.
2470565	2470905	For real?
2470925	2471305	Yesterday.
2471345	2471765	For real.
2471785	2472566	Like a real theater.
2473006	2475267	Not one of the download services or whatever.
2475527	2478969	I played a real theater of magic machine at a gay bar in San Francisco.
2479169	2480190	Theater of magic is awesome.
2480530	2484634	Alan and I went to the city yesterday because his friends are having a house party.
2484954	2485494	Is it one I know?
2486255	2488557	I don't, it's called, should I say it on the show?
2488597	2488957	Oh, whatever.
2488997	2492480	It's Pilsner Inn, which is over, it's like Castro and Sanchez, I think.
2492821	2493862	I'm sorry, Market and Sanchez.
2493902	2494542	Then I don't know that one.
2495683	2499025	Well, this place was awesome because it's all decorated with penguins.
2499105	2500085	You know I love penguins.
2500546	2502507	And there's all these penguin decorations in there.
2502747	2505888	And then they have a Theater of Magic pinball machine in the back.
2505928	2506889	Theater of Magic is great.
2506929	2509570	This is like a bar that was made for me.
2509830	2511111	And the guy gave me a free soda.
2511851	2513192	Because I wasn't drinking.
2513232	2515593	I was a designated driver, so they give the free sodas.
2515813	2516434	That was cool.
2516554	2517874	Keep you alert.
2518255	2521696	Even though we were walking, I actually wasn't really driving that night, but it worked out.
2522297	2523958	So, yes, I played Theater of Magic as well.
2523998	2524398	It was hard.
2526235	2530556	It's not... I mean, it depends on how they have the rules set on it, but I mean, it's not that easy of a machine.
2530676	2537978	It was a five ball for the credits, but I swear that ball in there was weighted because it just flew down the table.
2538358	2538999	It was crazy.
2539399	2540379	Oh, Alan's correcting me.
2540399	2541599	It was Church and Market.
2541619	2543420	That was close.
2543720	2544880	I want to see the penguins now.
2545060	2546321	Oh, I took a picture.
2546341	2547181	I put it on Facebook.
2548257	2550177	I'll show you on my phone here in a minute.
2550497	2554758	Alright, but we have to get into housekeeping and then the real gaming news.
2555158	2558219	Housekeeping, join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2558539	2562419	Speaking of Facebook, you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2562679	2570141	We are also on Google Plus and that's the place where you can always answer the Fugle Question of the Week, which we'll get to in Part B. If you haven't answered it yet, now would be a great time.
2570821	2571861	We'll get into that a little later.
2572201	2577382	Meanwhile, let's get into video gaming news, starting off with Loki.
2577682	2581024	Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about Steam and some of the updates they're doing.
2581404	2589469	They've got some new... Well, they have the new wallet enabled, the Steam Wallet, which will allow you to kind of tie in with different community stuff.
2589509	2598055	Mainly, it's right now being used with Team Fortress 2, and it allows you to buy and sell items, I guess, using your Steam Wallet funds.
2598655	2602417	So you can make some custom hats or something like that and sell them for...
2603658	2604098	GameGuides.com
2623903	2629165	as part of the community beta and it's basically like game facts sort of.
2629965	2638069	People can create facts or guides or whatever and then you'll see them on the different games.
2638089	2640470	You just click guides and you see all the user-made guides.
2641110	2642010	So that's pretty cool.
2644971	2646592	It's always good that they're adding more features.
2649420	2652701	Why do you think they want to put GameFAQs into Steam?
2653861	2669025	Well, I think what they're trying to do is try to have it all encompassing because if you think about it, if they're trying to go for this big picture mode and stuff like that, they want you to stay in client rather than, oh, I got to leave this client to go look up how to beat this boss or something like that.
2669305	2675087	They just want you to stay in the Steam client as much as possible, I think is the reason why they're doing that.
2675734	2685817	I guess that's pretty cool, because too many times when I've been playing a game, and if I need the assistance of a guide or whatever, I have to have that next to me, the iPad sitting next to me, or a book even, or whatever.
2686157	2687778	And they're not the only ones that have done that kind of stuff.
2687818	2688718	I mean, look at IGN.
2688818	2690199	IGN did the same kind of thing.
2690219	2693980	They have these wikis and guides now for different games, and it's all the same reasons.
2694260	2697601	Before with IGN, it was like, okay, get some game news and information and stuff, but...
2698121	2702743	Oh, I need to look up how to beat this boss or how to finish this level or something like that.
2703164	2711808	And before, you'd have to either go to the forums, and hopefully there's a post about it there, or you'd go to a GameFAQs or something like that and go look it up.
2712188	2714569	And once again, you're leaving their website.
2714589	2715890	They don't want you to leave their website.
2715910	2721272	They want you to stay and soak in as much advertisement as possible.
2723753	2724394	Well, I mean...
2725723	2733485	I guess it's also kind of like a valuable way to stay relevant too because so many people are after those types of guides.
2733805	2737086	It's a good way to kind of give visibility to your site and so forth.
2737106	2739266	I guess it's just kind of how they're staying relevant in this day and age.
2743567	2747448	Alan in chat says, make Steam a one-stop shop for all aspects of fandom.
2747548	2755170	Buy the game, play the game, multiplayer, matching service, mods, DLC, FAQs, chat and IM, friends list, in-game overlay, alt tab lists.
2756411	2756774	It's true.
2756794	2758608	It has seemed to be what they're going for.
2760515	2761155	And fanfiction.
2762176	2763137	Soon fanfiction?
2763677	2764258	And slash?
2764838	2765879	No, no, no.
2765899	2769221	There is no slash pizza within Steam yet.
2769841	2770282	Who knows?
2770502	2770962	Shopping.
2772143	2773804	Non-game stuff coming soon, maybe.
2773844	2774124	Who knows?
2774845	2778267	Going to the Wii U, another place where apparently you can do a lot of things.
2778867	2781169	You can go into Miiverse without interrupting the game.
2781209	2783330	That second screen there allows you to do a lot.
2783831	2789174	But more stuff about the whys in the Wii U. A lot of news that explains the whys.
2789574	2790135	First off,
2790795	2793338	Why is there no online multiplayer in Nintendo Land?
2793778	2801426	A lot of people picked up Nintendo Land and maybe they don't have brothers and sisters or people that they live with to play the Nintendo Land games with.
2801506	2806031	So they have to wait for a party to come around to play a third of the pack-in games on Nintendo Land.
2806551	2807792	So why did they do it that way?
2807832	2816640	Well, producer Katsuya Iguchi, in an interview with Famitsu Magazine, said, quote, So in other words, they were ignoring the internet from the very beginning when it came to Nintendo Land.
2816660	2816720	Hmm.
2816740	2816800	Hmm.
2829551	2830593	And who was surprised?
2831113	2835380	Also, apparently Metroid Blast was originally supposed to be a Star Fox themed mini game.
2835540	2839065	Did you notice that there was no Star Fox game in the Nintendo Land?
2839085	2841208	Well, Metroid was originally going to be Star Fox.
2841669	2841909	Quote,
2846195	2860349	for example a game with air and ground battles works well with Metroid there was a time when Metroid Blast was going to be a Star Fox title but the prototype featured this vehicle that hovered around like a helicopter and we figured that'd never be a good match for an R-Wing
2861818	2863621	Interesting reason why they chose that.
2863701	2869869	I mean, the Metroid thing works fine, but it's interesting to hear that like, oh, it was totally this other series before.
2870290	2875737	Also interesting to hear kind of confirmation in a way that all they did was take all those prototypes.
2876298	2878261	What series can we shove this into?
2881192	2882613	What series can we shove into this?
2901823	2902563	That's what it should have been.
2902603	2903744	It shouldn't have been Hogan's Alley.
2903764	2906205	It should have been the Konami title.
2906225	2908407	Yeah, but Nintendo's not Konami.
2909547	2910448	Legend of the Mystical Ninja?
2910588	2910888	Yeah.
2911368	2911828	Goemon?
2912369	2912789	Yeah, sure.
2915070	2917551	Also, a follow-up to something we talked about last week.
2917692	2918052	Why...
2919363	2922384	Does Europe block the Wii U content late at night?
2922424	2924765	The mature rated 18 plus content late at night.
2925045	2927266	Well, Nintendo Europe came out with an explanation this week.
2927627	2928987	Blame it on Germany.
2929667	2937991	Quote, at Nintendo we always aim to provide a safe gaming experience for fans of all ages and ensure that we comply with applicable legal age restrictions across Europe.
2959515	2962902	and it was re-emphasized this is not the rule in the US.
2963623	2964585	At least not yet.
2965647	2970096	Refer to our discussion earlier in the show if you think that we may not be headed in that direction.
2974261	2975362	Don't buy the content digitally then.
2992941	2998705	Unless it's DLC, in which case you're kind of stuck, but don't buy those games digitally.
2998785	2999566	Go to the store.
3000106	3003529	All the more reason you should just go to the store where it's convenient, and then you know what?
3003569	3009333	Hey, I'm not playing Assassin's Creed 3 anymore on the Wii U. Maybe I want to pick up the next Assassin's Creed game that comes out.
3009653	3013016	Maybe I can trade in my old game, get some credit towards a new game.
3014357	3016658	Oh, can't do that with my digital copy, so...
3018757	3019998	All right, let's move on with some more news.
3020018	3020498	DarkSakura.
3020638	3021338	Mass Effect.
3021619	3022959	Mass Effect, all the things.
3023099	3023520	Oh, God.
3023920	3024840	All the Mass Effecting.
3026101	3032004	Actually, this is about Mass Effect 4, but I have an update to it before I tell the story.
3032804	3043230	This is coming from a story that was teased on Gamer Syndrome, and Eurogamer, bless them, they actually heard from an EA representative saying,
3044130	3048653	saying that it wasn't Gamble, it was some other Bioware team member.
3049373	3053555	And so they went back and contacted Gammer Syndrome and said the source was actually unreliable.
3054136	3056717	However, I'm going to talk about it anyway because it's Mass Effect.
3058186	3073144	so the rumor is what I'm going to put this as is going that Mass Effect 4 is supposed to have information out next year and launch in late 2014 to mid 2015 and they don't have an exact date on it um
3074645	3089635	They're saying that basically they haven't decided if it's a sequel or prequel, but that there is supposed to be one more batch of Mass Effect 3 DLC coming out, which honestly, if it's that rumor going around that it supports the indoctrination thing, I'm going to flip a table.
3091716	3103284	But they were also talking about other scrapped ideas that they wanted in Mass Effect 3, like going to Paladin or different changes in the final battle, and that they wanted multiplayer in Mass Effect 2, but it wasn't going to happen.
3104304	3108667	Um, so, uh, we'll see what happens.
3109808	3111929	I mean, it sounds like it's not far-fetched.
3115511	3117812	I think a lot of it is just theorizing, though, you know?
3117892	3119573	Like, it's so far away.
3119634	3120294	They could change so much.
3120314	3124156	They probably talked to, like, some guy who was in the meeting when they were bringing up stuff for a timeline.
3124176	3124596	Yeah.
3125357	3128639	Although I do think it's funny that they used the brochette picture of him looking horrified.
3129594	3136058	I'm really happy to hear, though, that Shepard won't come back for Mass Effect 4 because it's just going to make Shane bitch and complain and cry.
3136218	3137519	I have my own headcanon.
3139140	3140100	It's okay, Shane.
3140120	3141481	We can live in our own headcanons.
3142156	3157654	I think... Well, here's the thing, and this is what I told Shane and what I say openly, is that, you know, it's okay to start a new trilogy because now that there's been so many games, it's gonna be so hard to, in the fourth game, have all those choices from the first three games play out in the fourth game.
3157714	3159837	And you saw what happens when your choices...
3160197	3164099	Do not play out into the way it all ends or ties up, right?
3164359	3165759	With that first ending to Mass Effect.
3165799	3172262	So I think BioWare wants to just start a new slate and it's fine that they do that.
3172322	3176404	Because the first Mass Effect trilogy was so great, the second one will be too.
3176684	3181810	Did you hear, you know about the people doing the happy ending mod for Mass Effect 3?
3182210	3185754	Well, I finally watched one that involved Garrus as the love interest.
3186475	3191760	And you could, and actually, I told you I went back and hacked my game to get Kelly in my game.
3192181	3196085	They use that series of animations from when Kelly is hugging Shepard.
3196605	3203628	And so Garrus' face does all this weird, like his plates over his eyebrows move so funny, it's absolutely hilarious.
3203648	3205468	I'm like, he looks like a sad puppy.
3206509	3207789	So, just saying, it's funny.
3208289	3212551	As long as Mass Effect trilogies don't go the way of Star Wars trilogies, we'll all be fine.
3212911	3213671	Just throwing it out there.
3217074	3224596	It already can't because the ending of Star Wars 6 or whatever you want to call it, the ending was like the best ending ever.
3224676	3228977	And the ending of Mass Effect 3, well, some people weren't so thrilled about it.
3230138	3231138	Anyhow, Loki.
3231418	3231678	All right.
3232198	3240541	So we talked a little bit about how there was already some of the old homebrew stuff for the Wii that was enabled with the Wii Channel on the Wii U.
3241461	3245165	But the one thing that wasn't working yet was the Homebrew Channel.
3245465	3247427	However, now that's not the case.
3247807	3257217	The Homebrew Channel does work now because they've released a brand new version that will work with the original Wii and also the brand new Wii Channel on the Wii U.
3258097	3286436	so that's kind of interesting and basically that allows you to do some of the stuff that you could do before using the homebrew channel including I think run stuff off of hard drives like ISOs and stuff like that but also other homebrew stuff is available I'm not sure if there's any sort of limitations on what you can run on the homebrew channel if they've got some stuff locked out for the Wii U because I know there was some limitations before
3289258	3295220	Oh, I guess one of the things that I guess won't work is Boot Me, but they haven't really figured out.
3295240	3302583	They may just make a new release with Boot Me support later on, but I don't think that was necessarily something that required for like...
3307445	3312346	I never did ISO loading off of the Homebird channel, so I really don't know.
3312726	3316767	But yeah, Homebird channel 1.2 is now available.
3317467	3321328	Or I guess the HackMe installer 1.2 with the Homebird channel version 1.1.2.
3325416	3340801	So that you can download off of HackMe.com So Nintendo will patch this out in the next little update they do Because TV, I would think TV has got to be out next week Because they announced that for December, right?
3340941	3343702	And they're going to want to get it out before the holidays Because they're going to send
3344062	3349227	I mean, although, yes, Nintendo's based in Japan and it might not be the exact time off that it is here.
3349247	3350769	I don't know if they can.
3350789	3352130	I mean, they can keep patching.
3352170	3358637	They patch it by blocking the title ID, but then they just change the title ID number for it and then it works again.
3358677	3365243	So I don't really know if they can block it or if they're even going to try because it's Wii stuff.
3366244	3371127	Do you think they'll try to get this through the main menu as opposed to having to go into Wii and all that stuff?
3371187	3372748	Try to get Wii U Homebrew Channel?
3373209	3374390	Is that probably a goal?
3374610	3380834	Well, originally with the Homebrew Channel, the way they got through it was with the GameCube emulation stuff.
3380894	3383876	So it's possible they could do that.
3384136	3389419	If they find some way to exploit it, they could possibly do like a Wii U Homebrew Channel.
3389840	3394082	Does that mean Homebrew Channel doesn't work on newer Wiis that don't have GameCube emulation?
3394163	3394523	Or is that...
3395063	3395824	No longer a factor.
3395844	3396804	I don't think it's a factor.
3396884	3401027	I thought the first homebrew came through Twilight Princess was some type of hack through that game.
3401067	3406090	Yeah, but that was a loader that they ran certain like doll files or whatever, the dolphin files.
3407371	3412955	So I don't think... I mean, because you can run those and you can run... There's some other type of file format that you can run as well.
3413395	3422141	So I don't think it's necessarily going to be blocked in those that don't have that emulation anymore because it still may load those file formats.
3422321	3422982	It just may not...
3423582	3444152	you know it just doesn't have the physical stuff to do GameCube so I don't know so but hypothetically if homebrew channels working instead of waiting an hour for the Pikmin to move all my crap from the Wii to the Wii U because I have all my games backed up to hard drive on the Wii if I get homebrew channel running I can just run them off homebrew channel now right maybe
3445942	3447804	Off HD Loader or whatever it is.
3447984	3448765	Maybe I'll do that.
3448805	3451567	I'm not really sure because, like I said, I don't know if they have any limitations.
3451627	3467681	I don't know what exactly they need as far as iOS exploits because I remember before when you're updating that stuff, you'd have to have certain iOSes loaded in and certain modded iOSes when they do a new update or something like that.
3467701	3470384	You'd have to patch those in order to get things to work.
3470764	3471925	And since I never...
3473186	3478789	See, I never really needed to do off of a hard drive because I had a physical mod chip in there.
3482010	3483151	Why bother doing that?
3483191	3486573	You can just burn a disk.
3487313	3489334	I don't know what you needed to do that.
3489734	3494056	I'm not sure if they can run stuff off of hard drives anymore.
3495117	3495717	Thank you for watching!
3516690	3521999	but wasn't like the Dreamcast supposed to be proprietary as well and you can just burn the CDRs?
3522059	3522700	Yep.
3523602	3527929	There was like garbage data that you'd have to sift through but other than that
3528200	3539383	So, I mean, you know, it may be proprietary, so maybe they'll just have some sort of drive emulator that runs to a USB drive or something, or they'll find a way to load games onto the hard drive.
3539844	3547506	I'm sure, I mean, come on, this has only been out for like a month now, so it's still very early, and the fact that they have the Homebrew channel running is...
3548386	3554371	Kind of shows that Nintendo just didn't give a shit because they didn't really do that much to patch it out.
3554471	3558515	They could have blocked the exploit to do it, but they just didn't.
3560325	3562947	The Secret World is going to be going what they call buy-to-play.
3589625	3592186	Not free to play, because it's not going to be completely free.
3592706	3594826	Think of the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 model.
3595046	3596847	You buy the game, and now you can play online.
3596867	3598007	I like that model, to be honest.
3598027	3599568	I think it's a great model.
3599748	3600508	Obviously, I like it too.
3601368	3604729	But there still will be some different tiers.
3604769	3608130	There's going to be free, member, and grandmaster.
3608510	3609030	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3624546	3630810	XP bonuses, bonus points in-game, special monthly gift, 10% discount in the in-game store.
3631251	3635273	If you're Grandmaster, you get another 10% off in-game purchases, etc., etc.
3635374	3645260	So definitely this model is going to lure a lot of people into checking this game out who might have written it off at first because, you know, who wants to pay $15 a month for yet another MMO or what have you.
3645921	3648082	There's an announcement trailer that came out for the game.
3648422	3651545	The announcement trailer is called Pay Once, Play Forever.
3652645	3653546	Here's my thing, though.
3655660	3659844	Not to doubt Funcom or whatever, but Play Forever?
3659864	3661385	Isn't that a little misleading?
3661765	3664848	Play Forever for seven years or so.
3665429	3665669	Maybe.
3665689	3668972	It just makes me glad I didn't buy my lifetime membership for Star Trek Online.
3669652	3672555	Because the very next year, free to play.
3673295	3673495	Right.
3673795	3678436	Well, at least Star Trek Online is still going.
3678916	3681597	You know, at least Star Wars is still going.
3681737	3683377	Come on, Final Fantasy XI.
3683457	3683977	Come on.
3684618	3686698	This game came out way after you did.
3686718	3687638	I mean, come on.
3687678	3689099	You've made your money already, right?
3689139	3689459	Come on.
3689499	3690059	Free play.
3691159	3691879	Come on.
3692159	3693600	You have to wait and see what happens with XIV.
3696081	3698562	14 is going to try and be subscription based too, so we'll see.
3699083	3699503	But anyway.
3699923	3701144	WoW is still working though.
3702185	3705767	I don't know what would happen if Final Fantasy XI comes by to play.
3705787	3709109	I don't know.
3709309	3710810	But back to forever.
3710930	3712331	I mean, how many games have we seen?
3712492	3713512	I like Immortal Talking.
3713552	3714533	Play until you're sick of us.
3715113	3717594	Well, how many games have we seen that just kind of shut down out of the blue?
3717714	3722434	Like, you know, City of Heroes, I believe, just pulled the plug where they're about to.
3722794	3725295	It's right now that it was supposed to be ending.
3725315	3726635	That's because it was awful anyway.
3727535	3728595	Don't tell Alan you said that.
3728775	3729516	I tried to play it.
3729556	3730216	I thought it was awful.
3730796	3731976	Matrix Online.
3732796	3736417	What was that Richard Garriott game, the sci-fi shooter game?
3738417	3738797	Damn it.
3739197	3740198	Terra something?
3740318	3741218	What the hell was it called?
3741238	3741758	Terra...
3743417	3743897	I don't know.
3743917	3746960	It was only around for like two years and then they pulled the plug on it which sucked.
3747700	3749902	I'll say Terra Nova but that was a show that got canceled.
3749922	3750602	No, that was a show.
3750662	3752263	Somebody in chat will say it because I can't remember.
3752283	3753284	That's a colony in Mass Effect.
3754653	3755333	Was it Rift?
3756094	3759515	No, Rift is still kicking, and Rift has a subscription too, and it's doing pretty well.
3759555	3762196	I mean, it's one of those rare games that's doing very well.
3762216	3765817	A lot of the kids that are too cool for World of Warcraft go to play Rift.
3766337	3768678	At least that's the impression I get from internet forums.
3769999	3771640	So, Tabula Rasa.
3771680	3772740	Thank you, Dungeon Buster.
3772760	3774581	That was the name of it.
3774601	3775421	It's on the tip of my tongue.
3775441	3776041	Tabula Rasa.
3776081	3776681	Thank you, Dungeon Buster.
3776701	3780023	Rob, does that mean that you had a clean slate when you were trying to think of it?
3780843	3781783	That's what Tabula Rasa means?
3781823	3782804	Yes, I get it.
3782864	3783244	I get it.
3784736	3787980	Yeah, well... Fuck drumming.
3789903	3791165	Why are you yelling at chatters?
3791686	3794289	Bobby said fuck Mass Effect and I said fuck drumming.
3796172	3797714	That was very random.
3797734	3798996	That was Tourette's-y.
3799056	3799237	Why...
3799617	3802118	No, I was responding to our chatters because I pay attention to the chat room.
3802138	3803939	Oh, okay.
3804019	3804400	Let's see.
3804540	3813204	TigerClaw in chat says, It sucks being inside an MMO and you're doing missions solo and unable to get help because nobody responds to your requests.
3814985	3821848	K Saracera says, I love it, but monthly fee was something that almost made me stop playing because I can't MMO and keep my job.
3822849	3828372	Technus says, Well, as long as they don't screw up their free-to-play model like the old Republic, they should be okay.
3831493	3833574	ImmortalKing in chat says, play till you're sick of us.
3835175	3836755	There you go.
3836835	3839476	DungeonBuster, kind of giving some other background on Tabula Rasa.
3839756	3841997	Tabula Rasa went through a crazy development shift.
3842077	3844778	It started off like this weird fantasy sci-fi stuff.
3845099	3846979	Then it went completely extreme.
3849540	3849700	So...
3851141	3851562	There you go.
3851622	3854525	The secret world going by to play.
3854825	3858630	And I got to be honest, it's incentive for me personally to want to check it out again.
3858690	3861073	I mean, how much are they still charging 60 for it?
3861093	3861753	I don't think they are.
3861893	3864056	It was on sale for like 30 at one point.
3864136	3866959	So I'll have to see, especially with the Steam sale coming up.
3868521	3869602	Steam sales coming.
3869683	3870564	Brace yourselves.
3872011	3872891	Where's our picture?
3873351	3874052	I'm not ready.
3874172	3875312	Where's our picture of who's that guy?
3875352	3878653	Is that Viggo Mortensen from one of those Game of Thrones or one of those shows?
3878934	3879854	Brace yourselves.
3881174	3882155	Steam sale's coming.
3882655	3882995	Lord.
3884235	3886416	Alright, DarkSakura, you gotta know the story for us.
3888097	3889277	You've broken my brain, Rob.
3889297	3891118	That's why I'm here.
3891138	3894259	How about, well, here's a game I think that we're all a fan of it.
3894559	3895660	Ghosts and Goblins, right?
3897340	3898360	Yeah, I like Ghosts and Goblins.
3898400	3899201	I'm aware of it.
3899361	3899481	Pfft.
3900822	3902244	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3923605	3932712	So, um, you can actually, uh, it's got, uh, influences like from, uh, Shinobi, a few other things in there, Karnov, Trojan, different things that are thrown in.
3933293	3938457	But it's basically just as masochistic as playing the, uh, Ghost of Goblin series, or Makaimura.
3939197	3943520	So, uh, I watched the, um, the trailer and actually I kind of think I want it.
3944541	3949445	You can actually get the game on the game's site.
3949825	3957650	Just go to Locomalito.com and you can get it for free.
3960833	3963735	And of course, you're a Ghosts and Goblins fan, so this doesn't surprise me at all.
3963755	3965376	This is something you might want.
3969195	3973738	Do you think you would still be able to tolerate the nauseatingly difficulty of these games?
3974018	3974779	Good lord.
3975359	3981763	Well, we were actually... Dan was showing me a version of it that... I want to say it was the Sharp version.
3982003	3983665	Did they do a version of that for the Sharp computer?
3985246	3994772	We were watching the Super Graphics version, which I told Dan right then and there I wanted a Super Graphics, where it has all the animation and everything, and it does the charge and all that.
3994852	3995853	I was like...
3997478	4000861	I went to SuperGrafx just to play Ghosts and Goblins.
4002442	4005064	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4005264	4008726	Figure out some games that are coming to a console near you.
4009547	4010468	Or even PC, maybe.
4010688	4010928	Loki?
4011709	4012870	There's not a whole lot this week.
4012930	4018073	It's pretty much just Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Vita.
4020695	4024158	Which clearly must have been delayed from the rest of it.
4024460	4028022	Yeah, and even the 3DS version is not coming out until next year.
4028483	4028743	Weird.
4029703	4032886	Yeah, it's kind of disappointing.
4032926	4035307	That is literally it.
4036088	4038049	Well, the holiday games have to be out by now.
4038169	4040430	Yeah, the next few weeks are going to be nothing.
4042358	4042658	All right.
4042998	4044799	Well, there's some stuff going on in Japan.
4044919	4046760	You know, it's a little different in Japan.
4046840	4049162	So there's some games still coming out this week.
4049502	4055325	Call of Duty Black Ops 2 on the Xbox 360 Dubbed Edition makes its way out on December 20th.
4055345	4056706	Do you know who publishes it in Japan?
4057346	4058347	Call of Duty Black Ops 2?
4058387	4058607	Somebody.
4059127	4059867	It's not Activision.
4061148	4061568	In Japan.
4062609	4063569	It's not who you'd expect.
4064150	4064830	Take two.
4065030	4065631	Square Enix.
4065731	4066251	Square Enix.
4066691	4067151	Publishes it.
4067171	4068252	That actually doesn't surprise me.
4068292	4070133	Square Enix does a lot of localization work.
4070643	4073785	Well, yeah, that and now that they have the Eidos part of it, too.
4073865	4076246	You know, that we've seen some very different games coming out of that company.
4076306	4077667	So, you know, I just thought it was interesting.
4078047	4081089	But anyway, also, Shin Hokuto Musou.
4081489	4083990	That's a regular and treasure box edition.
4084030	4086812	And there's all these, like, Xbox Live cards coming out around this, too.
4087752	4091154	I believe this is a Fist of the North Star game.
4091374	4092535	Is it Hokuto no Ken?
4093936	4097077	It's a reimagination of Hokuto Musou.
4097177	4098818	It's probably Fist of the North Star, too.
4098958	4100159	Yeah, I can tell by the logo.
4101353	4103436	It's the Fist of the North Star, Ken's Rage 2.
4103596	4104637	Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
4104817	4107140	That is exactly what it is based off the little YouTube trailer.
4107160	4108021	Oh yeah, totally.
4108061	4108421	Totally.
4108501	4110203	You can see from the screenshots that's what it is.
4110444	4111124	Extra blood?
4111445	4111785	Yes.
4111945	4113447	So that's coming out over here in February.
4113669	4114509	Oh, okay, there you go.
4115050	4118972	That game also coming out on the PlayStation 3, as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4119772	4122073	Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box.
4122093	4124675	Remember that box with, like, everything Final Fantasy in it?
4125135	4126415	That's out in Japan this week.
4126716	4128116	Catherine gets a price reduction.
4128416	4130978	Call of Duty Dubbed Edition is on the PlayStation 3 as well.
4131258	4139142	There's a whole PlayStation 3 console around Shin Hokuto Musou, so obviously the Fist of the North Star stuff is big over there, much bigger than I give it credit for.
4140002	4148389	Also in regular and luxury limited editions this week, Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka o Kirisaku Hikari Tukage comes out.
4149490	4153013	This is not a series I recognize.
4153434	4156796	It looks a little tactical with anime chicks.
4158478	4160419	That could have been like every Japanese game ever.
4161500	4164643	But anyway, that is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4165404	4166765	Going to the PlayStation Vita...
4167941	4195928	AKB149 Renai Sosenkyo comes out from Bandai Namco this week also in regular and limited box editions let's see looking at the that was the Vita let me look at the Wii U now that that is out in Japan Sports Connection and the Family Party or Simple Series for Wii U Volume 1 I'm sure that is their equivalent of what the hell is that called over here 30 party games
4196488	4199310	Yeah, it's a family party.
4199630	4203231	The most hilarious Miiverse board you will find on the entire system.
4205433	4207013	That's the one I made you read last week, remember?
4207414	4207854	Yeah.
4208494	4219720	On the Nintendo 3DS this week, Tongari Bushi to Maho no Machi comes out, as well as Osare de Kawaii Konyo to Asobo Umihen comes out as well.
4219760	4221080	I have no idea what any of these games are.
4221281	4221481	What?
4222561	4223661	Osare de Kawaii
4241354	4242195	That's adorable.
4242275	4244617	It had Asobi in the title, didn't it?
4244838	4245879	Who doesn't want to play Games of Puppies?
4245979	4246960	It's like playing Games of Puppies.
4246980	4247881	Who doesn't want to play Games of Puppies?
4247921	4249943	That's the best title for a game ever, playing Games of Puppies.
4252245	4253566	I like playing Games of Puppies.
4255385	4258586	I would say they should localize that and put that out here, but let's be real.
4258626	4260166	Those puppy and kitty games are a dime a dozen.
4260187	4262967	Would you buy a game that was called Playing Games with Puppies?
4263127	4264768	If it had a corgi on the cover, maybe.
4264888	4265528	Hell yeah.
4267149	4270570	Alright, let's do a couple more news stories in the classic game of the week.
4270650	4270870	Loki.
4271790	4282058	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, you know, kind of what we talked about last week with some servers going down for like Sniper Elite and Neverwinter Nights.
4282679	4289824	And of course, you know, there was a whole thing with, well, GameSpy, why are they, you know, taking this stuff down?
4289904	4299332	Because, you know, they're saying that, oh, you know, I guess it's just the company's, you know, Rebellion is taking it down because they just don't want to continue with it.
4299372	4299492	Well,
4300112	4300912	That's not true.
4301552	4306994	Glue Mobile, since they were the ones that bought GameSpy, apparently they've upped the rates.
4307714	4320158	And they've basically said, not even really in a polite manner, they've basically said, well, they've decided to discontinue service with us because they're not paying their fees.
4321278	4325800	But what they forgot to mention is we raised our fees quite a bit more than what they were before.
4327060	4334962	So that's why these games are no longer on their sites because Glue is trying to charge too much for the middleware that they're using.
4336322	4336522	Ouch.
4339103	4339903	Kind of sucks.
4339923	4344884	They got to be careful because they're not the only company out there that does this stuff.
4344944	4349965	So if you're going to be assholes about it, I hear Steam's pretty good.
4350325	4350565	Mm-hmm.
4353363	4363675	Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week, and this is about a game called Oculus Rift, which is... It's a peripheral.
4364035	4364556	Oh, okay.
4364576	4366218	Did I do my games...
4367472	4369873	Oh, you didn't do your releases, did you?
4369893	4370393	No, I didn't.
4370513	4371033	Oh, my bad.
4371113	4373574	I've been waiting, and I was like, geez, Rob!
4373754	4378276	Well, we were too busy being occupied with cute puppy games.
4378476	4379517	Well, then do your release dates.
4379737	4380237	Okay.
4380837	4384718	In the UK, on December 17th is Street Fighter X Mega Man on PC.
4385739	4391741	December 18th is Escape Vector with a K. December 19th is Escape Vector with a K on the 3DS.
4392401	4394702	And the 21st, Fuel Overdose in Vectropolis.
4395483	4396683	There, Rob.
4398575	4400856	I wonder if Fuel Overdose is like a sequel to Fuel.
4401437	4402817	That'd be awesome.
4403338	4403878	I don't think it is.
4404018	4404398	I doubt it.
4405919	4408661	Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset.
4409601	4413003	This group in Irvine, it's a startup called Sinful Robot.
4413063	4419447	They are looking at this device to do, quote, the world's first series of fully immersive erotic encounters.
4420387	4420967	All right.
4421027	4422388	Hell yes.
4423748	4427270	Apparently, they're posting for different 3D artists and animators.
4428270	4438474	I guess, of course, news about this hit Reddit and Sinful Robot actually got the thread and said, thanks to the device, quote, we can finally make an erotic adventure game that will actually be exciting.
4440355	4440995	All right.
4442680	4443641	It'll be in 3D.
4444241	4444602	That's right.
4444682	4445963	Virtual reality.
4446943	4450585	Those tits will be in 3D and it's just anywhere you look.
4450645	4451806	Titties, titties, titties, titties.
4452146	4452707	All around you.
4453887	4455448	DarkSakura just looked down.
4455468	4457089	I wish it was a TV show.
4458590	4458911	All right.
4461012	4461852	Want to sell systems?
4461892	4462593	Just add porn.
4462793	4463453	That's the secret.
4464434	4465855	All right.
4466155	4468577	Let's go to a time when games were a little simpler.
4468597	4469017	Okay.
4469736	4475781	much simpler erotic games were bubble bath babes that was your erotic game
4479216	4480697	or Custer's Revenge.
4480777	4484018	Acidic Vampire in chat says, how about fucking someone in real life?
4484078	4485018	You can't beat that.
4485419	4486139	They will try.
4486459	4487799	Some people can't do that.
4489060	4489620	You know what?
4490521	4491581	That's why there's toys.
4492441	4492721	Alright.
4493102	4497103	Moving on to the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
4497643	4501085	Going into the vault, picking out a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should play this game.
4501665	4505206	And because it's episode 486, you remembered to pick a PC game, right?
4506207	4506467	Yeah.
4507287	4507668	Oops.
4508248	4508528	Oops.
4509629	4510049	That's okay.
4510069	4513391	I picked something that I brought up a bajillion times before but actually never covered.
4514071	4515652	Then what is the classic game of the week?
4516293	4517293	Panorama Cotton.
4517893	4519074	Yay.
4521343	4527729	Panorama Cotton is... I'm sure other people have heard of Cotton since I've brought up the Cotton series a bunch of times.
4528350	4531333	The original Cotton series were like side-scrolling shooters.
4531533	4533815	This one actually plays closer to Space Harrier.
4534676	4540061	And it was put out on the Genesis slash Mega Drive in 1994, only in Japan, by Success.
4543064	4546326	And on top of that, it's supremely rare.
4547166	4549167	They did like 600 copies of the damn game.
4550188	4557432	You really... Now, I have actually seen a copy and have actually held a copy because a friend of mine owns a copy of this.
4557752	4559533	However, she lives in... You're special.
4559793	4559953	Yes.
4560213	4563095	However, she lives in Nagoya right now.
4564796	4565937	So, Cotton is...
4568035	4570117	Well, it's just a very interesting little game.
4570137	4573719	I mean, you basically fly around with the cameras behind you and you shoot stuff.
4574300	4576762	And then you have the crazy little witch named Cotton.
4577222	4584928	So if you want to go into the story about this, Cotton runs into this little fairy.
4585948	4594215	Her fairy partner is Silk, but she runs into one named Nit, who tells her that the queen is starting to say things that don't make sense.
4594895	4598616	So she goes off to see what happens and doesn't come back.
4599096	4608859	So Silk and Nit start pulling this willow, which is this candy stuff that Cotton is super addicted to and she eats it and then she throws up and it's hilarious.
4609639	4616881	But Cotton sees the burnt piece of willow and eats it anyway and then says that she's really pissed off that people have, you know, burned the willow.
4617221	4620562	So now she's going after to save the day all for purely selfish reasons.
4621832	4631262	So, I mean, you basically, you're flying around on your little broom shooting stuff, and you're getting these little balls that give you power-ups and points, and it's just super cute.
4631302	4637989	Like, the part that Rob's looking at right now, you're flying over a rainbow stream in the middle of a desert.
4638710	4639851	and it's just super cute.
4640812	4654022	The game that was one of the very first games I ever brought up for Classic Game was Panorama Cotton that was the direct style sequel to Panorama Cotton which you can't get in the US.
4655302	4656243	It's super fun.
4656684	4657564	Just go play it.
4657764	4659946	It's like Space Harrier but totally cute.
4661560	4664542	And if you have $300 to $500, you can own your own copy.
4664762	4667945	Words can't express the giant lady boner you have for this series.
4668265	4669005	I love cotton.
4669806	4672007	I mean, it's just so on crack.
4673148	4677451	And I mean, seriously, if I could afford this cartridge, I would so buy it.
4677631	4678792	I would have it in a second.
4679673	4690240	I will tell people that are looking to emulate it, there are some Genesis emulators that will not run this game because it was fairly complicated, like I said, and they didn't do very many copies.
4690760	4698589	However, you can find ROM dumps of it, and I think that Gens is the emulator that I used to use to play it.
4699290	4700911	So, good luck.
4701792	4708440	Oh, by the way, I think there are repro cartridges of this that you can order that will work on US Genesis.
4709521	4710201	Well, then there you go.
4711102	4711882	I'll see if I can find it.
4712002	4715485	Your classic game of the week, Panorama Cotton for the Genesis.
4716165	4719468	Good luck finding a copy, but it sounds like you can at least do emulators.
4719508	4720589	Checking eBay real quick.
4720609	4721829	You kids can experience it.
4723991	4730536	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase WAVE.
4731260	4732520	Alright, we're going to take a break.

4766467	4774474	We are live on this December the 16th of 2012 with the 486th episode of our show.
4774534	4775895	That's right, 486.
4776455	4781240	Since DarkSakura neglected to do the PC connection, I'll ask Loki.
4781420	4785743	What's a favorite game of yours you remember from the 486 days on the PC?
4786144	4787925	What was a game that you remember loving on the 486th?
4789346	4794307	Um, I would say probably, even on the 486, I was still playing Castle Wolfenstein.
4794667	4794927	Yeah.
4795488	4798608	Um, so, I don't think I had a 486.
4798928	4800009	I had a 386.
4800069	4802709	My friend had a 486, and he had played Doom.
4803369	4806650	Um, I'd say also maybe, uh, Command & Conquer Red Alert, the first one.
4806790	4807190	Mm-hmm.
4808230	4810591	Um, what else did we play?
4810611	4810651	Um.
4811460	4839676	I didn't have a well no I did have a 486 actually my first computer was a 386 SX16 and then the next computer was a 486 I think 100 or something was the speed of those things and then after that was finally the Pentium but I had the 486 for a while that was probably my Civilization 1 days loved Civ 1 I was just I was a Sid Meier fanboy in general because like Covert Action Railroad Tycoon Deluxe I loved all those games Colonization all of them
4840737	4843421	DarkSakura, did you have PC games you played back then?
4843681	4845344	You've kind of always been more console, haven't you?
4845572	4846972	Yeah, I've always been more console.
4847232	4847933	Until now.
4848293	4848653	Well, yeah.
4849233	4852974	But on my friends, I actually was really into Doom.
4853954	4856215	I was really into Hexen.
4856475	4857135	Really into Hexen.
4857215	4857455	Oh, yeah.
4857495	4858235	Hexen was badass.
4858295	4858936	And Descent.
4859156	4864237	Because I told you about my friend's rig where he had it set up with a chair to play Descent.
4865037	4868018	And, crap, there was another game.
4868618	4871899	Oh, my friend and I would actually go through Phantasmagoria.
4872820	4875842	Oh, which I think I've reviewed Phantasmagoria on the show before.
4875943	4876423	Oh, I'm sure.
4876483	4876783	I'm sure.
4876863	4877704	Yeah, but we would.
4877844	4879966	Seven CDs full of awesomeness.
4880347	4880647	Yeah.
4881348	4883289	And what was the other game?
4883710	4885371	Probably Gabriel Knight.
4886012	4887493	No, I wasn't really into Gabriel Knight.
4887774	4888594	Jazz Jackrabbit.
4890757	4892279	Jill of the Jungle, Good Times.
4892299	4893400	No, just Jazz Jackrabbit.
4893701	4899127	I remember when Commander Keen 4 came out, everybody lost their shit because it was like Commander Keen Mario style.
4899427	4904273	Like the first Commander Keen was not so, but like Commander Keen 4 was like, oh my God, it's like Mario.
4905114	4905935	All that stuff was awesome.
4906335	4910757	Speaking of those games, not to give free commercials to a website, but you know what?
4910777	4911837	They're doing a pretty awesome thing.
4912217	4915238	GOG.com, if you visit the site that sells the old games.
4915979	4917459	I don't know if it's still going on.
4917519	4920360	Maybe the chatters can check, but they were giving away Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition.
4920380	4920860	Oh, it's over?
4920960	4921861	Yeah, it's over.
4922201	4924422	Did you say Hanukkah Edition?
4924482	4925082	No, Atomic.
4925722	4926422	I was like, what?
4926882	4930904	They were giving it away for Hanukkah, apparently, because it was about those same days, but...
4931244	4938307	It was... I want to say it was only through the 18th, maybe?
4938327	4939828	Or maybe it's done.
4939968	4941888	I can't remember if it was... Let's see here.
4942949	4957655	But they have a lot of old games that I remember from that era that are... Because I was actually looking into Populous the other day, because somebody brought up Peter Molyneux, and I was thinking about the other games he'd done, like Black and White and stuff, and I was like, oh, Populous was an awesome game.
4958175	4959296	I remember my other big game.
4959316	4959756	What's that?
4960017	4960377	Loom.
4961358	4961978	Oh, yes.
4963239	4964821	I freaking loved Loom.
4964921	4966382	I played through that game so many times.
4967463	4969104	And you remember when it came out on Steam?
4969144	4969725	Guess who had it?
4970445	4974829	Actually, I had bought a PC copy CD before and then it came out on Steam.
4975029	4976290	Yeah, Loom's a great choice.
4976491	4976871	Good stuff.
4977438	4977698	All right.
4978399	4979920	Yeah, I think it's over.
4980260	4984844	It looks like Actdeft is confirming Duke Nukem was free till Thursday.
4985345	4987026	And Porkchop says the offer is over.
4987046	4987747	It was pretty cool, though.
4987987	4990089	That is all from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
4990109	4990769	I did pick it up, though.
4990789	4993171	That was the first LAN game I ever played was Duke Nukem 3D.
4993492	4996234	I used to call into a BBS to play.
4996694	4997415	Actually, I think it was...
4998596	4999737	It was Doom 2.
5000537	5006580	You would call the BBS and you could do games, but then they'd want to charge you for each minute on the first 30 or something.
5006680	5011662	Duke Nukem 3D was a game that I played a lot on on my Pentium, I think.
5011963	5013183	Go ahead.
5013743	5019526	I used to work at MobyCon for a couple years and we had a big setup with Duke Nukem 3D.
5019546	5024849	You could also do your voice macros so we could put in your face, your ass, what's the difference, and all the ones that we liked.
5025345	5025845	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5045177	5067033	and since you know in it's like you're living in these tiny little like rooms right but everybody had their own phone line so we would use the phone lines to connect Duke Nukem and so I'd be playing in my room he'd be playing in his room we'd have the doors open yelling at each other on like a Friday night or whatever and all the other guys would be like what the fuck are those nerds up to and so they'd walk into the room and they'd be like oh and so the
5067373	5072679	What they do, they'd go into one room and then they'd see where we're at and then come in the other room and tell one of us like, oh, you got to go get him.
5072719	5074140	He's over there or whatever.
5074200	5075742	So those are some fun nights.
5076683	5084651	Actually, as much of a nerd as I was and picked on for that, I was very popular because I had the only Super Nintendo with Mario Kart.
5085272	5087594	And those guys always wanted to come over and play Mario Kart.
5088007	5089168	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5109701	5110802	and Sailor Moon.
5111402	5120026	So they would come over to my room to watch all the anime because also my friend, who was the same one that built the descent chair, would just copy me all kinds of fun stuff.
5120846	5126288	And we would do our own personal dub to Ura Tsukidoji, the Legend of the Everfiend.
5127389	5128809	Oh yes, yes, I know Ura Tsukidoji.
5128929	5130910	And then play Toshinden all night.
5131150	5131791	It was epic.
5133572	5138334	BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I was popular because of Mario Kart 64.
5138834	5144718	See, I didn't get a Nintendo 64 right away, but the people that lived right above me did.
5145418	5151582	And they got one right – because it was like the holidays that year that I was a freshman in the dorms that that system came out.
5151982	5156945	They got one right away, and you better believe they were the popular kids when they got that.
5157045	5157445	I mean even –
5157905	5164427	I was up there as much as possible, too, playing, I guess it was Mario 64 at the time, because Mario Kart wasn't a release title.
5164487	5166867	Maybe it was a year after.
5166907	5167688	I can't remember now.
5167748	5168328	It's been a while.
5168828	5173409	Because I thought they had Mario Kart, but maybe that was like the next semester or something like that.
5173729	5174389	I can't remember.
5174990	5175830	My memory's fading.
5176510	5178671	But yeah, they definitely had a Nintendo 64 upstairs.
5178711	5183972	And, you know, at the time it was like, dude, the graphics in this are so good.
5185856	5212810	and then I got a Playstation like the next year and I probably I missed an unhealthy amount of class thanks to Final Fantasy 7 and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 fuck that game seriously alright yeah Blackwolf says the N64 came out at Christmas but Mario Kart didn't come out until right around spring break so I was kind of close they got the system at Christmas and then I remembered like I thought I played Mario Kart up there they must have got it the second semester before the end of the year
5213971	5214371	Good times.
5214471	5214731	All right.
5215512	5220593	Let's move on and get back into some gaming news with some rapid fire news.
5220673	5220933	Loki.
5221333	5221634	All right.
5222194	5228396	So Minecraft, of course, has sold a lot of copies and 5 million of those now are the Pocket Edition.
5229196	5234018	And, of course, the franchise is now up to 17.5 million copies.
5234258	5237999	And I'm sure a lot of those are the Xbox Live Arcade version as well.
5238919	5257374	and um right now they are up to i guess the next update is going to be 0.51 wait i thought pocket edition was specifically the phones they consider xbox live pocket edition no i'm saying the total sales are 17.5 oh oh sorry so um so i said i'll bet a bunch of that is the xbox live arcade version no
5257814	5264638	So anyways, the phone version or iOS version or whatever, Pocket Edition is going to be receiving an update soon.
5264758	5269741	It's 0.51, and I guess that's going to include online multiplayer.
5270041	5274304	It says right now you can play, but it has to be on local Wi-Fi and not through the Internet.
5274564	5279447	So that would be kind of cool that you can be able to play worlds through the Pocket Edition.
5280548	5283769	It's probably a good thing, though, that it doesn't work with our current servers because...
5285219	5285619	I don't know.
5286179	5286980	That might be bad.
5287000	5292141	One of the things I forgot to mention was at my game week, they had a thing this week they were giving away.
5293221	5296542	It's this company, PowerA, and they have these controllers called the Amogas.
5297242	5304685	Basically, it's a Bluetooth controller that you can snap your phone into and play games on.
5304725	5310206	They were giving it away with Modern Combat 4, that new Gameloft game.
5310946	5311087	And
5312927	5313607	I hope that's the case.
5333633	5346935	Anyways, Retro City Rampage, a game that's pretty awesome on the Vita and PlayStation Network, supposed to be coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade and WiiWare services, and it's been a while since this was released.
5347015	5350596	It originally came out in the beginning of October, and that was also on PC as well.
5351436	5359757	And now it's actually in certification for Xbox Live Arcade and WiiWare, so probably in the next few weeks.
5359837	5361798	I'd say by the end of the year you're going to see a release for this.
5363399	5364262	which is pretty awesome.
5364342	5367009	So definitely worth checking out if you've got those systems.
5369211	5395366	and last but not least I don't know if I should be scared about this thankfully it's not for quite a few years but uh the Angry Birds movie is moving forward now they've got um you know some people attached to it including I guess the producer um John Cohen has signed on he's the guy that did uh Despicable Me and also uh David Macell who did I guess producing on Iron Man and um
5397327	5400470	I don't know, the movie's not supposed to be out until summer of 2016.
5400570	5407575	Which, hopefully Angry Birds is still a thing by then.
5408316	5414561	Because, you know, these franchises sometimes kind of disappear in a few years, so...
5416089	5420371	You know, I wish I could say I cared about the Angry Birds movie, but I don't.
5420592	5422633	I have no fucking clue what the hell it would be about.
5422653	5424954	Would it just be a bunch of birds exploding on impact?
5425334	5430197	I especially give no shits about the Angry Birds movie now that they confirmed Tron 3.
5430858	5431478	So, you know what?
5433330	5435112	That's the only gaming movie I need in my life.
5453544	5454404	But it's Ender's Game.
5454424	5455024	It's awesome.
5455125	5455905	So it'll be cool.
5456105	5463247	And I hope that God by 2016, Ready Player One better fucking be a movie because they've already sold the movie rights to it.
5464007	5465508	It better be a fucking movie by then.
5465748	5469769	As much as Bobby doesn't want me to keep bringing this up on the network, Mass Effect.
5471490	5473351	is gonna be a movie from Legendary Pictures.
5473631	5474292	But here's the thing.
5474612	5475693	Here's what'll make it worth it.
5475933	5479436	Because all the fanboys and fangirls are gonna rage.
5479816	5481237	Because it's not gonna be done right.
5481337	5484400	Like, you know they're gonna fuck up that movie.
5485100	5493287	Because, like, you know, let's say if they cast a man to play Shepard in the Mass Effect movie, there's gonna be all these people that are like, Femme Shepard, get the fuck out.
5493367	5494348	This movie isn't canon.
5494388	5494748	Fuck it.
5495168	5495348	Which...
5496689	5520426	to some extent as much as I enjoy Mass Effect when I play as male Shepard so I can like have my gay time with Kaden if they did a movie around FemShep I would not complain I really think they do need to do the movie as FemShep I'm trying to think of the worst person they could cast for like Shepard in that for male or The Rock no no no no they got they gotta you gotta be thinking worse than that Freddie Prinze Jr.
5520466	5522568	how about that that's because he's Vega
5523723	5526105	Yeah, but I wouldn't want to play Vega, though.
5526185	5532051	No, but I honestly would love to see them just do a CG movie and have the same voice.
5532792	5538658	Because honestly, to quote a mutual friend of mine in Becky's, Mass Effect is the best movie I've ever played.
5539478	5540559	Rob Schneider as...
5543627	5546429	Alright, enough of that Angry Birds movie.
5546589	5549771	But seriously though, I don't understand how there's no story to the game.
5549811	5551152	That's like making Tetris the movie.
5551172	5552172	It doesn't make any sense.
5553053	5555114	At least when you try to do Super Mario Bros.
5555134	5556655	movie, there's a general plot.
5557395	5560537	Angry Birds is like, these pigs are bad and they blow up.
5560957	5562178	It's a puzzle game.
5562218	5565080	You can't make a fucking movie out of a puzzle game.
5565380	5572144	I understand that you think that you can because you want to have money, but there's just... I don't know.
5574051	5578756	What would be a reasonable actress, like one that would not cost millions of dollars that could be FemShep?
5578976	5582080	I think the girl with the dragon tattoo.
5582180	5582480	What's her name?
5582560	5585003	Numi Rapace or something like that?
5585343	5585764	I don't know.
5585844	5586324	Could be it.
5587145	5589307	Because... I don't know.
5589368	5591350	Then there's that part that's like, oh, Scarlett Johansson.
5591390	5591870	But I don't know.
5592090	5592291	I don't...
5592711	5593371	I can't see it.
5593391	5594892	Honestly, no, no, no, no, no.
5595192	5596233	The one who played Maria Hill.
5596353	5603557	Because there's actually a Photoshop thing out there where they put her in the armor and everything as female shepherd.
5604137	5605038	And she looked the part.
5606038	5606698	She was perfect.
5607239	5608559	Wendy Williams-ass.
5608960	5610701	Hold on, let me look up who she was.
5611021	5612061	And I'm talking about the Avengers movie.
5612081	5612802	Hey, Garris, how you doing?
5617455	5618255	All right, moving on.
5618996	5620756	I'm going to try to find out who it was that played her.
5622357	5625898	Some folks in chat talking about Nathan Fillion as Uncharted.
5627718	5628618	That's what Blackwolf said.
5628678	5630419	Nathan Fillion needs to do the Uncharted movie first.
5630439	5631719	Nathan Fillion as Garrus.
5631879	5632480	No, I'm kidding.
5633200	5633560	Anyhow.
5634060	5637221	Okay, Kobe Smulders.
5639248	5641529	Black Wolf says, how about Jennifer Hale as FemShep?
5641589	5642229	Here's the thing.
5642389	5643569	She's a voice actress.
5643609	5650252	She's not like, there's a big difference between, I mean, she's a great voice actress, but I don't know what her experience is with like stage and movie acting.
5650312	5652552	If she's got the chops, then sure, why not?
5652612	5654813	But I'm all for heavy.
5655393	5658274	I think she's also a little, I hate to say it, she's kind of old for the part.
5659274	5659614	I think.
5660915	5662215	Well, Shepard is supposed to be 32.
5663816	5664536	Not in the first game.
5664856	5667217	If you look in the timeline for the first game, she's 30.
5668346	5669687	I thought she was 28 in the first game.
5670247	5671667	She's supposed to be 32 by Mass Effect 3.
5671707	5678410	They totally need to do a Heavy Rain movie with voice acting intact.
5678990	5679970	Jason!
5679990	5681331	Jason!
5681351	5683051	I can see them doing a Heavy Rain movie.
5683091	5686492	Now the guy who does Garrus' voice acting is totally goofy looking.
5686952	5689493	I brought him up from the episode of Buffy.
5690094	5694955	However, they should have a general actor and have him do the voice.
5696216	5697016	And then I will be happy.
5697679	5698379	All right, moving on.
5698720	5699860	Let's get away from movie talk.
5699920	5700921	Let's talk about retro games.
5700941	5702822	Penn and Teller is sovereign.
5702882	5703082	Stop.
5703102	5703362	Stop.
5703462	5704683	All right.
5705163	5706904	Getting into retro games.
5707024	5711366	Capcom Arcade Cabinet is something that's rumored for the 3DS and the Wii U eShop.
5712307	5713667	No idea what the hell that is.
5713787	5719410	It's probably just repackaging the same old stuff to try and sell it over again, just like they're doing on the iOS.
5720071	5722232	There was a Capcom Arcade Collection on...
5723152	5725013	I don't know the rest of it.
5751608	5754569	Xbox Live is getting some new apps.
5754889	5757909	SkyDrive, CNET, Maxim, Karaoke.
5758309	5760350	They actually just added them this week.
5761570	5762250	That's pretty cool.
5762270	5767591	They're not out in every countries, but they're out in the U.S.
5767671	5768051	at least.
5768131	5771592	And I think Canada got Maxim and CNET.
5771672	5773092	No, Canada just got CNET.
5773612	5778473	And Karaoke and SkyDrive are going out worldwide, except Japan and Japan.
5778853	5780894	and United Arab Emirates for karaoke.
5781014	5784016	I imagine that Japan's going to get a different version of the karaoke app.
5784496	5789939	The karaoke app is interesting because I don't know if you guys have heard about this, but the karaoke app is not where you pay for the app.
5790419	5792240	You pay for like a rental.
5792740	5799024	Like I think it's like 10 bucks for a 24 hour period, or maybe it was like three bucks for two hours.
5799184	5804527	So I don't quote me on that, but it was like, you know, you can pay to rent it, but then it's like all the songs.
5805367	5807509	for that period of time.
5807529	5810011	So that's interesting.
5811192	5816958	You can turn your living room into one of those karaoke studios and have all those songs at your fingertips.
5817018	5818079	It's an interesting way to do it.
5818979	5820921	I'd be interested to check it out next time I have a party.
5821402	5822282	People love karaoke.
5823283	5852034	SkyDrive by the way there's old Orange Lounge radio episodes on SkyDrive there used to be information on the Orange Lounge radio forums but those are kind of sunsetted now that we have the VOG Network forums maybe DarkTetsuya can post the information on the VOG Network forums there is a SkyDrive login you can use it's just like an on your honor thing please don't go in there and fuck it up because people worked very hard to put in the old episodes but there is like a login you can use for the SkyDrive if you really want I'm just going to warn you it was a very different show back in the first
5852914	5858076	200 episodes, but if you really want to hear what did episode one sound like, it's on the SkyDrive.
5858296	5860017	So you can hear that through your 360 now.
5860317	5865599	You can't even get VOG through your 360, but you can get old-ass OLR episodes thanks to the SkyDrive app.
5867740	5868180	Pretty cool.
5868400	5878904	And then Maxim and CNET are just... You can't download VOG episodes using Internet Explorer through the... You can't use the live radio player in Internet Explorer, which is weird.
5878924	5879565	I don't know why.
5879585	5880665	Because it's Internet Explorer.
5880825	5882946	Well, I don't get it.
5883086	5892868	I thought the audio was protected, but I went to the website where our player, Bobby might know more of the technical end of it, but I went to the website where the player that's on our website comes from, and the test MP3 works okay.
5893188	5895668	I think it has something to do with the streaming MP3s.
5895709	5900330	Remember for a long time, Google Chrome wouldn't play VOG Network when we first launched because of security things?
5900390	5901650	I think it's something similar to that.
5902590	5926681	I don't know if you can play the mp3s on demand on the show pages I haven't tried that but honestly if you're gonna go to all that trouble just turn on your pc and download the shows come on all right uh also coming to the wii u unepic is a game that's coming to the wii u it's a 2d platformer that features rpg elements uh bosses pets potions and so forth and
5926861	5927181	DarkSakura
5949670	5955552	Well, in other gaming news, we have some stuff coming out of Imani Style about a new DDR game.
5955572	5958634	Well, not really new, because it was supposed to be out in February this year.
5959414	5977922	It was announced originally as Dance Dance Revolution Gris, and now we have Dance Wars that basically has, it's a follow-up from the Dance Dance Revolution S and S Plus that came out on smartphones, but now has multiplayer functionality and uses social networking.
5978782	5984903	and no word about a US release but they said there was an international intent to release.
5985624	5987264	And then OEA.
5988384	5988964	OEA.
5989705	5995526	They have rebranded their Play For Free brand into Origin Free To Play.
5996926	5998106	Yeah, but still Origin sucks.
5999367	6000567	No one cur to play.
6001900	6005101	and then a game that fights bullies, Rubber Kid.
6006782	6028270	Basically it's a Kickstarter that's supposed to be raising money to fight bullying and they're hoping to get $750 to basically do a tie-in book, comic, cyberbullying edition that will get people into the dialogue about bullying and teach kids ways to protect themselves.
6029230	6029650	So that's it.
6031503	6035468	Alright, let's get into the Fugle question of the week.
6036489	6039393	Because every week we ask a question on Facebook and Google.
6039513	6040955	You slam them together, you get Fugle.
6049579	6054523	This week in the Fugle Question of the Week kind of ties into something we were asking about earlier on the show.
6055384	6056785	Or talking about earlier anyway.
6057126	6063371	When a company launches an online multiplayer game, how long do you believe they are obligated to support that online multiplayer game?
6063691	6066613	Are you bothered when support is pulled after only two years?
6066633	6067214	Yay.
6067974	6071297	Are there any old games you can't play online anymore that you wish you could?
6071697	6075781	What do you think we could do to convince companies to support that game online?
6075801	6075861	Yay.
6077142	6081427	Actdeft says, well, for consoles, they should be set up as long as the console's life cycle.
6082168	6086512	For example, at least until the next console is launched or a year or two later after it launches.
6086953	6088955	As for PCs, that's more complicated.
6088995	6095842	But I would think that if a lot of people are playing the game's multiplayer, they should keep the servers up or at least give the players an alternative or something.
6095862	6096383	That's from Google+.
6097524	6104588	Surtur says at least three years or post two sequel versions of the game.
6105008	6110091	Red Entertainment says it's not about length, it's about usage.
6110611	6115233	If people are still actively playing the game, the company who made the game should still support it.
6115573	6118215	The cost of the support also factors in the decision.
6118495	6124158	However, in the cases of big companies like EA and Activision, the question of supporting a product should not be brought up.
6125925	6126566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6142961	6156896	That's true, the online pass, I didn't even include that in the question, but yeah, the online pass kinda... Like, I'd be pissed off if, like, a game I played, you know, I had to pay an online pass for, let me say I bought it used, and then it shuts down three years later.
6157284	6157784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6176619	6184032	Well, even, like, look at some of the games, like Saints Row the Third or whatever, that lock system link behind an online pass.
6184132	6185033	Oh, yeah, I remember that.
6185053	6186496	It's like, what?
6186936	6188860	System link behind an online pass?
6189160	6190102	You guys are assholes.
6192504	6196308	I'm going to some of the answers from Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
6196348	6207538	TigerClaw says, I noticed only a small handful of games had their online multiplayer pulled, but games like Battlefront 2 still have online, and I see a lot of people playing the game's online multiplayer on the PlayStation 2 version.
6208078	6210400	So some games never get their support pulled, it seems.
6210761	6217066	I mean, for a PlayStation 2 game to still have online support, that's pretty... I would have thought Final Fantasy XI was the only one left.
6218367	6219107	Ragenator says,
6244458	6249002	I believe a company is only obligated to support online multiplayer until the next incarnation of the game is released.
6264835	6268496	If a new version isn't released, it should stay online for a minimum of two years.
6268916	6276557	The percentage of people on these games that are diehard dedicated is far less than the people willing to move on to a new game or the next installment of a game.
6276997	6278798	I speak from personal experience, of course.
6279398	6282118	I gotta admit, he's naming some pretty tight windows there.
6282198	6288500	I mean, until the next incarnation of the game, I mean, if you're EA, that's every year, basically, right?
6288560	6291240	For the sports games, that means it would only be a year.
6291560	6294581	But I do get what he's saying is that most people move on
6295902	6298743	But this online pass thing is going to add an interesting element to it.
6298983	6299623	And not everybody.
6300003	6301123	Some people buy those games used.
6301804	6305064	You buy the previous year because it's cheap and it's pretty much the same thing.
6305284	6309125	Or say you don't like a version of the game when it comes out and it sucks or something like that.
6309245	6310906	Like has happened with some of the basketball games.
6310986	6317068	Like NBA Live, you know, so you buy NBA Live 10, I think that was the last one.
6318068	6318228	And...
6320538	6325555	You didn't like it, or you didn't want to buy the next one because it never came out in the last two years.
6326344	6354745	BlackWolf telling us that game with the online pass that shut down it was EA Sports MMA was the game he's linking to a story that talks about those shutdowns so you know the online pass adds an interesting element is that you know and I'm seeing a common theme in these answers which is you know kind of a logical answer they should only keep them up as long as people are using them which makes sense but even for those let's say there's 20 diehard fans that still play it you know and it's not considered to be enough
6355586	6361790	Does the plug get pulled on those 20 people who now have paid an additional $10 in the form of an online pass to be there?
6362350	6363311	We have to pull the plug?
6364472	6368054	I mean, it's a tricky line to walk, I think.
6368614	6369795	Anyway, let's read some more answers.
6369815	6371656	Let's see if we still have a consensus going on.
6372297	6372997	Burr says,
6382143	6383244	Well, let me throw this out there.
6383284	6387127	Would you consider the new SimCity or Diablo 3 an always online experience?
6388248	6389469	I just had to throw that out there.
6390169	6395613	It's stupid to me that a shooter, for instance, would be unplayable online just because there's no other option for hosting a game.
6396074	6400437	In the case of an MMO, though, they should only feel obligated to run it as long as they're turning a profit.
6400817	6403459	Unfortunately, in the case of City of Heroes, that apparently wasn't enough.
6403960	6410385	Shame on NCSoft for simply shutting it down instead of handing it off to someone else if the profit wasn't enough for them.
6411025	6412367	or what about just throwing this out there?
6412627	6414469	What about opening it up to the public domain?
6414589	6416411	That's what Phantasy Star Blueburst did, right?
6416792	6418334	DarkSakura, you follow that more than I did.
6418794	6423159	When Blueburst closed, didn't they just release everything you needed to do your own private server?
6423319	6423540	Yeah.
6423860	6424040	Yeah.
6424261	6425702	I thought that was a classy way to do it.
6425822	6428646	And they let you actually pull off your character data off their server.
6428686	6429206	That's awesome.
6429587	6430127	That's classy.
6430848	6432588	Cram says, Codeman says, Codeman says,
6454113	6482155	and that is a portion that will never be removed don't remove online play because that person paid money for it so you should support it for life Rob himself says if it's to pay if it's pay to play per month they should support that online multiplayer game if they don't it should be 100% free unless it's totally crap then burn it with fire well here's my question does pay to play online mean a monthly fee or does it mean online pass
6483974	6511393	and lastly Mike B says probably until there is only one person playing it online by themselves then shut it down so it does seem to be there's a general consensus amongst the listeners of the answer of you know when the people disappear then so should the game although nobody's really naming what that threshold is is that 2% of the initial base is that 10% is it a certain time frame you know where is the point that you pull the plug
6512955	6517616	Does that mean the next time we have one of these stories about server shutdowns, it's just going to be, oh, well, no biggie.
6518637	6519417	We knew this was coming.
6519557	6520817	This is what we've come to accept.
6521717	6522458	It's interesting to me.
6524278	6526199	But I like the way Sega did it, I got to say.
6526299	6538702	I think that's a model for how it should be done is that if companies are going to shut down the online support, then open it up for people who are fans of the game to let it live on if they want, right?
6539925	6540266	I think so.
6541927	6546472	I still wish that all of these MMOs would just go the path that Sega did like we discussed.
6548514	6550836	Alright, let's move on with some other news.
6550876	6554019	We'll get to the mailbag, the FUs of the week, and phone calls in just a little bit.
6554339	6555821	First off, more news, Loki.
6556261	6561043	Alright, so there's going to be a few companies dropped from the NASDAQ 100.
6561303	6563404	And you may think, oh, THQ.
6564165	6565425	No, it's actually not THQ.
6565705	6569207	It is some bigger companies, including Electronic Arts.
6569727	6573169	Electronic Arts is going to be dropped off there as well as RIM.
6574249	6578851	And also Netflix is being removed as well.
6579611	6582893	So kind of interesting that those are being dropped there.
6582933	6585574	And I guess, of course, they're adding Facebook as well.
6587944	6588204	Hmm.
6588364	6589425	Honestly, what does that mean?
6590086	6592348	No fucking clue, because I don't do finances.
6593569	6597792	Well, usually if they are, I think the NASDAQ 100 is what, the top 100?
6597912	6598293	Yeah.
6598813	6604438	So these, you know, and especially in the case like Facebook, I don't think it's still caught up to where it debuted.
6604938	6605018	No.
6605058	6607460	So it hasn't really met investor expectations.
6607540	6610963	And, you know, these other gaming companies have had kind of a rough year.
6612224	6614326	This will all go into effect, I guess, on the 24th.
6615487	6619010	But Netflix had a really shitty year, investor-wise.
6619410	6621252	I mean, they're gaining ground again for it.
6621312	6623114	But remember the whole Quickster debacle?
6623174	6624134	That was this year, right?
6624154	6624975	It was earlier this year.
6625496	6626957	That fucked them royally.
6627197	6629979	And a lot of people pinned the CEO's handling of it, honestly.
6630580	6633102	And they've been making some smart decisions since then.
6633122	6635905	The whole Arrested Development, they've been doing a lot right.
6636285	6640609	But the way they handled that whole Quickster thing, their stock plummeted.
6641269	6642931	and that probably almost single-handedly.
6642951	6646554	I'm very happy to see that they finally have added It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
6647055	6647956	I thought that was always there.
6647976	6649417	No, no, no, no.
6649677	6650838	They just added it.
6650898	6652580	I think they added it back.
6653821	6657425	But, yeah, I mean, they're doing better, I guess.
6658045	6662470	I am kind of disappointed, though, that they don't have the game rental service because that would be pretty cool.
6663697	6664077	Leisure Suit Larry
6687348	6690793	Yes, and I wasn't sure if this was parody or what, but no.
6691414	6696341	Leisure Suit Larry and the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the next game that he's slated to score.
6696762	6700828	In an interview with Polygon, he said, quote, that's my era as a gamer growing up.
6701229	6703412	This was like a fantasy to work on a game like that.
6705458	6705998	You know what?
6707659	6711562	Some artists want to do something radically different when they go from project to project.
6711922	6727012	And I can't think of something more different than an artistic piece that you could hang on the wall like a painting, like Journey, and then going to Leisure Suit Larry, which hopefully will be better than the last round of those games, which were so bad.
6727032	6730034	Well, Leisure Suit Larry is just a remake of the first one, so it's going to be good.
6730694	6730794	Uh...
6732575	6733456	Not necessarily.
6733476	6736078	Remakes are not always better.
6736759	6739401	I had fun with some of the other ones.
6739441	6741142	The last game they put out was crap.
6741543	6745846	The one before that wasn't... It was bad, but it wasn't super terrible.
6746246	6747968	They had some interesting things on there.
6748428	6749589	The minigames were kind of funny.
6751411	6756475	It would be awesome to be able to score porn music with an orchestra.
6756495	6756575	Yeah.
6761192	6761992	Alright, moving on.
6762252	6762812	DarkSakura.
6764313	6768614	Moving forward, we do have some information coming out of Microsoft.
6769554	6778256	They're finally lifting the Windows Store issue ban with the age 18 rated games.
6779436	6784257	Basically, that includes Dishonored, Mass Effect 3, Assassin's Creed 3 within the Windows Store.
6785278	6794554	So they were going to not sell the PEGI 18 titles, but then they rethought it and said they want to expand their commitment to Windows Store games.
6796097	6796337	So...
6800154	6806015	It was originally in there that said their app must not contain adult content and metadata must be appropriate for everyone.
6806496	6808656	But now they're just saying, eh, just let them decide.
6809116	6816658	You know, it was kind of ridiculous that they removed the whole Microsoft Excel off there because its metadata was fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, Excel.
6817118	6820799	You know, and some people, that may be a selling point, but, you know.
6820979	6826240	Well, back in the day, there was like what the hidden gate to hell in Excel back on Windows 3.1.
6828670	6828990	What?
6829831	6833552	Yeah, it was, there is programmed into Excel.
6833652	6835553	It's either Excel or Word, but I think it was Excel.
6835953	6841556	There was like just a little small bit of data that, you know, you could walk around this little temple.
6841576	6844757	It was like a temple to something that was hidden in early versions of Excel.
6845257	6846738	It was just like a developer Easter egg.
6847778	6848198	I'll find it.
6848299	6848559	Hold on.
6849259	6849519	All right.
6849579	6850319	No, I believe you.
6850359	6852360	I just had never heard of that.
6852960	6853361	How funny.
6854101	6854181	Hmm.
6855686	6856927	Moving on.
6857948	6859569	One of them was a flight sim.
6860630	6861051	That'd be fun.
6862532	6865635	Machinima.com has reduced their staff by 10%.
6865715	6871220	This is kind of odd because I thought the company was doing pretty well.
6871240	6874542	They've got a lot of ties and exclusives and stuff.
6874603	6876324	They started doing a lot of...
6878786	6879726	Affiliate Channels
6903093	6907874	It's hit the editorial group, but we're still doing editorial coverage in a slightly different way.
6908594	6912355	So, it's just, I guess, they maybe hired too many people for what they need.
6912635	6916436	Just more... Badly managed.
6917116	6918136	I guess, yeah.
6919176	6927017	So, 10%, I mean, yeah, it sucks that, you know, but when you hear, like, 10% normally, it's like hundreds of jobs, but 20 is not so bad.
6927178	6929778	I mean, it's not great, but, you know.
6930489	6934234	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Machinima is shady.
6934314	6936037	You heard about the stuff about the contracts.
6936497	6937939	Oh yeah, that was in the news some time ago.
6938040	6940343	People rebelling out of the blood packs, basically.
6940363	6941565	They were signing with Machinima.
6942646	6943508	Own you forever.
6945233	6947794	I don't know why you would partner with Machinima anyways.
6947954	6950595	For a YouTube channel, it doesn't make any sense why you'd do that.
6950735	6959817	The popularity... People get blinded by the fact that people want to pay you money for doing this kind of stuff.
6959857	6961998	People just make rash decisions sometimes.
6962978	6964819	And not even... I shouldn't say that.
6964839	6968141	I make it sound like everybody who's signing a deal with a company is making a bad decision.
6968201	6969842	Maybe not necessarily.
6969882	6973304	But some people sometimes make decisions that they regret later.
6973724	6980768	Like, have you ever maybe had a job in your life where after you were there a couple months, you're like, maybe I shouldn't have taken this job.
6981969	6982229	Right?
6983109	6984170	But that's... Never.
6984730	6984910	Right?
6984970	6985611	Never, right?
6985691	6986631	No, I would never say that.
6987312	6988712	So, you know...
6989973	6996701	Anyhow, one more story before we get to the mailbag, and that is about Capcom and Mega Man.
6997422	7005552	Now, we've got this whole Street Fighter across Mega Man thing happening tomorrow, just a reminder, probably today for most of you listening to the podcast.
7007034	7029319	There's a ton more things we have in the works, according to USA Senior Vice President Christian Svensson Only some of which will be shared December 17th This is in regards to Mega Man, of course There's a whole year of things that will happen You're only going to hear about what's happening fairly close to the start of the celebrations at first So could we be getting some bombshell news about Mega Man tomorrow?
7029359	7032820	None of which will be Mega Man Legends 3 Or should I say Blue Bombshell?
7037386	7055141	so anyhow could be a big day tomorrow we'll see but at least there's that free Street Fighter Mega Man game that'll be cool I mean even if it was fan community but it's cool to Capcom and they linked up and made it happen I'll be downloading it that's for sure should we get to the mailbag?
7055541	7056382	why don't we should?
7056602	7056742	we
7063522	7072470	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and picks out a few emails to share with us on the show.
7072550	7074932	Remember though, it's only a three hour show.
7075132	7077113	We can't read every single email.
7077374	7078154	But we do read them.
7079355	7080136	And I laugh at them.
7080256	7081137	No you don't.
7081157	7081837	Well sometimes you do.
7082158	7083719	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7084150	7085571	I'm gonna read the one that was written to you.
7114891	7116312	Yay, Commodore 64!
7116632	7121696	They had two C64s, one in a text-based adventure section and another in a computer gaming area.
7122217	7124398	I hope this doesn't make you feel as old as it made me feel.
7125039	7130223	I think I'm going to have to dig mine out of the box in my mom's basement and fire up Ultima 4 in way of the exploding fist.
7130343	7132865	You're a bastard for having one that still works.
7133026	7133386	Just saying.
7133999	7142546	The other great thing was that they had a collection of Star Wars action figures, most of which I owned at some point, but my sister sold at a garage sale when I was shipped over to Operation Desert Storm.
7143007	7144068	I never saw any of the money.
7144148	7145248	Damn her, damn her to heck.
7146570	7149472	At least she didn't sell many of my comics.
7149792	7151193	Because this is where he's pissed off.
7151914	7157717	The museum was a lot of fun, not a destination, but if you or any of your listeners happen to be in upstate New York, it's worth a side trip.
7158338	7167123	Peace, LatRatY2K, DishonoredEdgesOutOME3 and Halo4 is my GOTY.
7168755	7168915	Pac-Man!
7168935	7169116	Pac-Man!
7188718	7201657	Play Commodore 64 Oh, look at that, a Zork 2 box Good times There's a floppy hanging on the wall Good stuff Curse you for having a Commodore 64 that still works though
7203959	7204359	Next up?
7204579	7205200	Yes, next up.
7205460	7207321	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
7208001	7213204	I didn't get a chance to comment on the Fugle question of the week last week, so I decided to give my answer via email.
7213685	7214305	Oh, sorry, you're late.
7214345	7214605	Click.
7214725	7214825	No.
7215506	7219348	As a refresher, last week's question was, and I'm paraphrasing, have video games ever taught you something?
7219793	7224175	Thank you for putting that in your email, because we all would have forgotten, honestly.
7224215	7225356	Do I ever pay attention to that?
7226096	7228878	The only one I paid attention to was, what do you want for holidays?
7228978	7229678	And I'm like, Garrus.
7231119	7231519	Anyway.
7231840	7235882	My answer is, video games taught me how to gain self-confidence and make lifelong friends.
7236262	7238323	When I started playing DDR back in 1998, shut up.
7240024	7249667	I never imagined that the confidence I gained from being good at DDR would lead to me breaking out of my shell and interacting with people who treated me... Wait, why did you tell him to shut up for saying he played the game back in 98?
7249887	7250687	That's when it came out.
7250987	7253888	I know, but it was like back in 98.
7254308	7256909	14 years later, we are old as fuck.
7256949	7258129	Shut up, shut up, shut up.
7258749	7260169	Let me finish reading the email, Rob!
7261290	7263750	Who treated me as an equal despite my nerdy antisocial demeanor.
7264470	7266691	I wouldn't be the person I am today without video games.
7266791	7270972	I'm sure you guys and gal at OLR would tend to agree.
7271492	7273713	Thanks for letting me rant about how awesome video games are.
7273753	7274373	You guys rock.
7274433	7275553	Yours truly, AZHP.
7275773	7277054	And seriously, thank you.
7277274	7278574	Yeah, I get that too.
7278974	7280535	I learned to play drums
7296363	7297523	Speak for yourself, awkward.
7298084	7298224	No.
7298864	7299804	Last email.
7300564	7302545	That was kind of an awkward statement you just made.
7302565	7303185	I'm just saying.
7303606	7304806	Your face is awkward.
7304826	7306026	It's a little awkward in here right now.
7306046	7307287	Awkward is such a fun word, isn't it?
7307987	7309948	Because it's like got W's and K's in it.
7310148	7310348	Mm-hmm.
7314557	7315678	Talk about awkward.
7315718	7316999	That was a weird thing to say.
7317019	7321221	This is not me, but does the word awkward just look awkward?
7321702	7323483	You know what other word has W's and K's in it?
7323663	7323903	What?
7324263	7324664	Work.
7326024	7326965	But it only has one W.
7329369	7331290	Hi gang, it's your friendly neighborhood Ragenator.
7331991	7335773	I just thought I'd email a quick question just in case I don't get to call in for whatever reason.
7336154	7341757	The subject of VOG's music stream was the topic of a short discussion yesterday, Saturday, just before USL.
7342318	7347761	I think a few of us have a question directed to Rob seeing as how he's in charge of the music stream.
7348141	7355907	Will the community have the ability to donate any legally purchased music, either bought already on disc or bought via iTunes or whatever and burnt to disc?
7356667	7361148	and what would be appropriate for the feed.
7361849	7369791	I know that mainstream stuff that one would typically hear on terrestrial radio wouldn't work for obvious reasons, but I can see how game OSTs and whatnots would be doable.
7370831	7372772	I'll go ahead and say I gave Rob like...
7375422	7376944	How many DVDs worth of stuff?
7393722	7419802	um keep in mind though no major label stuff like with you know like there's some Weird Al stuff we snuck in there which but you know like we're just trying to keep the focus on indie and geek things and also do remember we don't want game soundtracks to dominate I mean obviously game sound it's it's it's gaming is part of geekery but we want it to be a balance between stuff so just you know no Lady Gaga or you know you know what I mean like let's
7420362	7421383	and DarkSakura.com.
7435359	7436000	Holiday Music on VOG
7458897	7461120	BlackWolfInChat says no mashups.
7461140	7461420	Yes and no.
7461440	7463423	I don't want to mash up with a Top 40 song.
7477120	7489869	but like there's a remix of the theme to Skyrim that's done like some type of like, I don't remember what it's called, but it's like a remix of that.
7489969	7492450	I guess you might be able to call a mashup and that's okay.
7492831	7496033	So just like as long as it's like indie stuff that's mashed together, that's fine.
7496833	7498254	So, all right.
7499415	7501316	I see that one more email just dropped in the bag.
7501356	7502837	You might want to refresh because this one's funny.
7502857	7503618	I already closed it.
7503738	7504558	Well, open it back up.
7504578	7505199	You want me to read it?
7505459	7505939	You read it.
7505959	7506580	All right, I'll read it.
7508221	7533460	one more email because I reopened the mailbag I bet it's Extifer no it's not it's Jim Sally actually oh hi Jim Sally and I only saw it because I went back into the email bag to look at those Commodore 64 pictures and I saw this from Jim Sally hey sexy host of OLR you ever use vibrating controllers for naughty purposes like tickling someone's pussy Rez
7535805	7541790	And then he signs the email, Cat, be nice for Santa this year, Jim Sally.
7542711	7545534	DarkSakura, have you ever tickled someone's pussy with a controller?
7546415	7548637	Well, Shermie used to like sitting on the controller.
7550258	7550799	Good answer.
7551659	7552500	I miss my kitty.
7553361	7554562	I need a cat in my life.
7556624	7560347	By the way, just to make an announcement, Sanrio let me pet her.
7561728	7562069	Yay.
7564102	7564682	I know, I know.
7565242	7566103	They can't hear you, Alan.
7566543	7568624	Alan just got home and he's talking about the cat.
7570164	7571485	I even got purr noises.
7572865	7576247	So, Loki, have you ever done anything naughty with a controller?
7576287	7578447	Of course none of us have done anything naughty with a controller.
7578467	7582269	I've thrown the controller at the cat to get her to stop doing something that she was doing.
7582689	7585170	My husband's crushed one in his hands several times.
7585330	7586150	Like batting.
7586750	7592212	She likes to knock stuff off the Christmas tree and stuff, so I'll throw something at her.
7592692	7593712	Sometimes it's a controller.
7593952	7594812	Oh, I get it.
7595052	7596613	Like tickling someone's pussy.
7596833	7598053	Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
7598113	7598433	Cat.
7598613	7599814	I get it, because that's how it was signed.
7600254	7600634	I get it.
7600854	7601214	I get it.
7602014	7603155	tickling someone's pussycat.
7603735	7605917	No, I've never done that to the cat.
7605937	7606997	The cats would not let me do that.
7607358	7609519	Alan would get very angry with me if I tried to do that.
7609659	7614583	Is Shermie one time really freaked out at the heartbeat thing in Silent Hill?
7615863	7621928	Because she was just sitting next to me while I was playing Silent Hill 3 so I put the controller on her back and she about jumped.
7622028	7622748	It was hilarious.
7623749	7624269	Good times.
7624389	7624970	By the way, Rez.
7626331	7631374	Alright, that's it for the email bag so let's get to the FUs of the week because we're so angry right now.
7647068	7652350	I feed him my hair for being in that weird in-between haircuts kind of thing.
7652770	7657031	But I've made a vow that I'm not going to cut my hair at least until my birthday.
7658072	7660192	Maybe a trim, but not like a for-reals haircut.
7660733	7663374	To see if I can stand growing out my hair for four months.
7665054	7666695	That's it.
7666715	7667135	Uh, Loki.
7668135	7671736	I feed him my brain for not wanting me to do, like, Excel work right now.
7671896	7673437	It's just like, no!
7674639	7677541	So I just can't work on this, but I'm gonna anyways.
7678262	7678582	I don't know.
7678602	7687168	It's like I've been trying to like, you know, get stuff done that I have all these projects that are kind of in the works that I just quit one and go to another one.
7687668	7693112	So I'm starting to try to wrap much of these up so I don't have a bunch of pending projects I'm working on.
7693612	7694913	So this is one of them.
7695153	7697815	My Grand Theft Auto mods that I've been working on for two years.
7700710	7706473	I'm going to give a good old-fashioned Orange Tons Radio FU to traffic, namely the traffic driving to San Francisco yesterday.
7706873	7712716	Three hours and 15 minutes for what was one hour and 40 minutes today on the way home.
7713157	7715398	Do you know what the difference was between yesterday and today?
7715998	7716398	Rain.
7716758	7719380	Because nobody knows how to drive in the fucking rain.
7719620	7720480	It's California.
7720600	7721921	So irritating.
7721981	7725323	It's like, ooh, there's a car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazard lights on.
7725643	7726263	Let's brake.
7726403	7726543	Go 70.
7726583	7726784	Brake.
7726844	7726944	Go 70.
7727004	7727284	Brake.
7727404	7727484	Ugh.
7731772	7732293	I hate you.
7733856	7740550	So yeah, that was very irritating because, you know, if we'd got to the city a little earlier, we could try to find more gay bars with pinball machines.
7740570	7741171	That's all I'm saying.
7743871	7744812	Ghost in the Shell MMO
7764714	7764974	Are they?
7765134	7765554	That sounds cool.
7765574	7766555	That's fantastic.
7766735	7772857	And I guess it's going to be a partnership between Nexon and Kodansha.
7773057	7773837	Kodansha?
7773917	7775098	Kodansha, yeah.
7775218	7776778	Is it based off of Stand Alone Complex?
7776998	7787322	It is Stand Alone Complex, and I believe it's, was it Stand Alone Complex and Stand Alone Complex Second Gig, and also the Solid State Society.
7788602	7795907	Ghost in the Shell is pretty awesome though Ghost in the Shell is pretty cool I actually liked the original Ghost in the Shell I didn't really see any of the new series
7815643	7815924	THQ Bundle
7831124	7832725	THQ's goal should be to bring entertainment to a wide audience.
7859420	7860041	Here's the quote.
7875592	7882638	So they're kind of, in a way, which is pretty fascinating for one of the bigger companies to do, they're kind of coming out and admitting, you know what we learned through this?
7883258	7884700	Maybe we are neglecting Linux.
7885180	7903915	Maybe there was enough, you know, support being buzzed out there that, you know, and especially for a company that's really struggling right now, and in some ways, you know, having an identity crisis of sorts and trying new things, you almost feel like they're kind of, like, you know, yes, it's just one pull quote or whatever,
7904776	7911240	But I do still feel like he means it much more than a lot of other people would because THQ is in a desperate situation right now.
7912621	7915463	Do you think we could see Saints Row on Linux someday?
7915843	7916463	Eh, probably not.
7916744	7920366	But what I thought the lesson he would learn is gamers hate everything.
7921800	7922300	Thanks for watching!
7944071	7961552	complicating the analysis in a positive way gamers have tweeted inventive ideas to me such as letting the community help in the porting to bring down costs THQ is committed to look at anything that makes sense I'm sure we'll have more to announce shortly community sourced porting
7962133	7964055	This is a desperate company right now.
7964395	7966457	And I hate to say it.
7966517	7970761	I know this sounds really opportunistic and like I'm dancing on their grave of sorts.
7970821	7976467	But what a great thing that's happening because of the fact that this company is struggling so bad.
7980563	7980883	I don't know.
7981023	7981504	It's just me.
7982584	7983045	Here's an idea.
7983065	7985426	Don't fucking lock System Link behind online passes.
7986507	7987608	Your game might sell a little bit better.
7988188	7988809	Seriously.
7990590	7990950	All right.
7992671	7996294	Let us move on to the Skype line.
7996314	7998755	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
7998795	8005280	If you want to give us a call right now and talk about whatever's on your mind, anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something we haven't yet.
8006160	8009041	In the meantime, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute news.
8009341	8010482	I'm going to pull up the Twitters here.
8011142	8013463	No, I don't because nothing's happening.
8013683	8015323	Yeah, it was kind of a slow news.
8015483	8016844	We had to stretch to fill the show tonight.
8017144	8020185	It's just like, uh, stuff.
8020805	8022405	Oh, that's okay.
8022425	8023306	I got stuff to do tomorrow.
8025854	8028135	Alright, well, we still have the Skype line open.
8028335	8028815	Call us!
8029195	8031776	I am pulling up the Twitter.
8031796	8041400	I mean, TigerClaw wanted me to mention, even though everyone's already noticed that's watched the Pacific Rim trailer, is that they have the voice of GLaDOS in there.
8041920	8047622	It's like, hey, let's get the same voice actor as GLaDOS, and then we'll just make it sound exactly like GLaDOS.
8047642	8049343	But that was a movie trailer, not a game trailer.
8049363	8050083	That was a movie trailer.
8050604	8051484	It's still awesome, though.
8052975	8055055	He tweeted that too, so I guess I can skip that one.
8055636	8056436	There you go.
8056516	8057356	Oh, we got a call coming in.
8057976	8058856	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8058876	8059196	Who's this?
8060017	8060597	Hey, guys.
8060637	8061437	Porkchop is gone.
8061637	8062557	Hey, Porkchop.
8062617	8063337	What's on your mind, buddy?
8064698	8068979	Just patiently waiting to see when Street Fighter Mega Man is actually available for download.
8069019	8071279	I've been refreshing the page about 100 times now.
8072419	8073540	Are you staying up all night?
8075060	8075920	Not just because of that.
8075960	8078321	I'm actually making my first game.
8078361	8079541	It's a project for college.
8080009	8088277	and I have to get it done for tomorrow, so I'm just a bit of an Asteroids clone, but that's not going very well, so I was hoping to get the game and just slack off.
8088718	8093623	Because I can tell by your accent you're probably not in the same country we are, and I know we've talked to you before.
8094283	8094764	Oh, yeah, yeah.
8094984	8096165	What time is it where you're at?
8096866	8099669	It is now 4.27 in the AM.
8099789	8100269	It's great.
8100429	8102892	I can see pretty colors on the walls and everything.
8103743	8104744	Is this normal for you?
8104784	8105405	Have a coffee.
8105665	8108188	Is this normal for you?
8108528	8109109	No, it's not.
8109249	8114695	I'm actually just really behind on work and stuff and tomorrow is the deadline, but I'd say we get an extension.
8114715	8115255	I'm not bothered.
8115295	8116877	I got to listen to all of it, so I'm happy.
8117505	8118666	Oh, what a nice thing to say.
8118686	8120868	Appreciate it.
8121208	8127633	Just to give you an idea, it's 8.30 here on the West Coast, which means it's 11.30 on the East Coast.
8128034	8134859	So best case scenario, the game will come out right after midnight on the East Coast, and that would be in about 30 minutes.
8135219	8137521	So that's your best case scenario is that the game will come out in 30 minutes.
8137581	8140263	If it's not out in 30 minutes, I couldn't tell you when it's going to come out.
8140303	8142425	Maybe another three hours when it's midnight on the West Coast.
8142925	8145126	or maybe they're going to wait until the work day starts tomorrow.
8145706	8148027	It might not really be out for you until tomorrow night.
8148067	8148687	I hate to say it.
8149547	8150728	Either way, I'm going to be awake.
8150768	8151248	I don't care.
8151328	8152908	I'm just going to waste the whole day playing it.
8152928	8153749	I'm really excited.
8155109	8157570	I guess you'll be having to get some energy drinks or whatever to stay up.
8158390	8166573	Yeah, I've just been drinking tea and eating lots of sugary things to kind of keep myself buzzed and try not to go to sleep because I want to get this finished for tomorrow at the same time.
8168034	8169234	So what is it you're studying in school?
8170137	8170498	Game Design
8184778	8187820	And that's what you want to end up ultimately doing, is doing design in the industry?
8188540	8189081	Actually, no.
8189101	8194444	It's something I wouldn't mind doing, but it's not strictly restricted.
8194464	8195485	I wouldn't mind.
8195565	8197526	Reviews and some things are good like that.
8197566	8199167	I don't mind typing stuff up.
8199207	8201309	I'm good with words, so anything at all.
8201429	8202149	I just love games.
8202189	8203030	I want to be involved.
8203050	8203330	That's it.
8204321	8204361	Um...
8220140	8227762	I suppose each company has their issues, especially EA and, you know, the whole Mass Effect thing happened way back as well.
8229503	8232484	I don't know, I mean, it doesn't bother me because there's always going to be games made.
8232504	8236105	Like, even indie gamers now are getting a really good, you know, push up there.
8236165	8238605	Like, Fez was pretty good when it was released.
8238645	8239726	You had the likes of Journey.
8240946	8243307	This guy getting an Emmy now, or sorry, a Grammy.
8243447	8244527	Was it a Grammy for the album?
8244767	8245367	Yes, Grammy.
8246008	8247208	Yeah, so he's doing pretty well.
8247268	8247468	I mean...
8248490	8263486	The media, the medium has always been pretty well respected and I think it's going to last for a long time but everybody's kind of you know they'll just hang on in there and it'll just be you know games are just going to be one of those things that just hang around like TV did.
8265725	8273831	You know, if the industry doesn't break through right away, it seems like there's a couple people in chat that might support you getting into your own podcast, radioing or something.
8274252	8276974	Extifer in chat says, this guy should have his own show.
8277114	8279135	And HitStun says, that is an awesome accent.
8281237	8283399	The girls seem to like it sometimes, but there you go.
8284628	8287289	Well, apparently some of the guys like it too, so there you go.
8288009	8290850	I don't swing that way, but very flattered, thank you very much.
8293911	8298172	So you want to get into either designing games or possibly critiquing them or something?
8298312	8300693	Yeah, something like even podcasts wouldn't bother me either.
8300773	8306575	I have a couple of friends who basically have worked and know a lot about the industry and stuff, so
8307022	8309243	You never know, we could team up and something good could come of it.
8309543	8312503	Well, don't ever expect a podcast to pay the rent.
8312563	8313544	That's all I'm going to tell you.
8313564	8314044	Of course not.
8314124	8316004	No, I'm happy to do it for fun.
8316044	8317945	You guys kind of inspired me with that as well.
8317965	8320625	You're like the first gaming podcast that I found.
8320685	8321606	And I was like, yay.
8322166	8323366	Oh, well, thank you very much.
8323766	8325066	That's an amazing compliment.
8325126	8330588	No, we love it when people... You know, you might think like we're very like, don't do your own podcast.
8330628	8331988	We don't want the freaking competition.
8332128	8333188	But that's not realistic.
8333328	8335069	Like podcasting is kind of like...
8335709	8363603	I don't know, it's kind of like ham radio in some ways, it's kind of meant for I mean, you don't have to be licensed to do a podcast but it's meant to be very open and accessible and for anybody to do them and we're very supportive of other people and like when people say, like, I was inspired to podcast because of your show, that's like the best compliment ever I think, you know, what they say, imitation is the finest form of flattery Don't forget that, you know, it does take a lot of time out of your schedule as well, so you know, respect to yourselves for like, you know
8364042	8364884	Thanks for watching!
8372392	8373832	All the way across the water as well.
8373852	8374193	Awesome.
8401741	8407184	All right, well, Porkchop, I should let you go just to see if there's anybody else who wants to call in and show off their accent as well.
8407244	8408665	But best of luck on your project.
8408905	8409365	A+.
8409465	8410906	I hope you get over your hurdle.
8411667	8412127	Thanks, guys.
8412147	8412847	Keep up the good work.
8413148	8413468	All right.
8413508	8413948	Take care, buddy.
8414448	8414749	Good night.
8414769	8415069	Bye.
8415189	8415429	Bye.
8415789	8418691	Good night.
8418891	8419491	Always good to hear.
8419531	8422153	I mean, we love the people here locally, too, like in the U.S.
8422373	8423574	I want him to read the phone book to me.
8428107	8431448	Maybe I should call him and see if he'd be willing to do new closing credits.
8432008	8432669	That would be awesome.
8433769	8434329	I should do that.
8434389	8436990	Get some of our international friends to do closing credits.
8437990	8438790	We need more bumpers.
8439070	8441691	This week's closing credits will be read by Porkchop.
8441731	8444511	And then one week it'll be this week's closing credits is read by Syl.
8444952	8448953	And then we'll have one week where this week's closing credits are read by Extifer.
8450193	8450633	Balls!
8453479	8456121	or bleached assholes.
8456181	8458203	Or trout penises.
8458223	8462727	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8463388	8464348	Going to some more tweets.
8465289	8467651	Tiger Claw tweets us an article that we haven't discussed yet.
8468132	8470494	And I actually saw this before the show, but I don't know.
8470514	8473076	It was just another like LOL Bobby Kotick story.
8473116	8474817	But since he shared it with us, I'll get into this.
8476098	8481923	Bobby Kotek kind of made a comment of sorts about the firing of Frank West and Vince Sampanella, who are now at EA.
8482923	8487927	He said that he fired them after learning that they were going to bail on their contracts to join EA.
8488407	8488728	Quote,
8497634	8497714	E.A.
8514571	8525516	I read another one, I didn't read it too closely, but there was one that was saying like, stop photoshopping my picture and giving me horns because it's really interrupting my dating life or some garbage like that.
8526796	8527817	It's like, whatever.
8529732	8530852	Let's see, some other tweets.
8531333	8537534	We had Ratchet1785 send us a tweet that says, Can't wait for the show.
8537714	8543476	I was wondering if you could mention my indie podcast I just started, the Down for Maintenance podcast.
8544136	8545476	Don't worry about it if you can't.
8545676	8546616	Oops, I guess I did name it.
8546956	8547777	I just love you guys.
8547817	8549957	I literally had the balls to make one because of you guys.
8549977	8550897	You're the inspiration.
8550977	8553358	Holy shit, that's like the second comment like that in a night.
8553418	8554258	Thank you so much.
8554378	8555219	That's amazing.
8555599	8556719	You didn't give the URL.
8558526	8560808	Where do I find the Down for Maintenance podcast?
8560848	8563069	I'll have to Google it or search for it in the iTunes stores.
8563449	8563970	But there you go.
8563990	8565951	There's your shout out and I'll check it out soon.
8566531	8567612	So congrats.
8567912	8572895	Now I'm wondering, there's a very similarly named Warcraft themed show.
8572955	8573756	Just throwing it out there.
8573776	8575717	The Realm Maintenance podcast.
8576157	8576898	Just throwing it out there.
8577778	8579259	So, but Down for Maintenance.
8579739	8581540	I wonder if that's an MMO related show then.
8582521	8583842	You need to tell me more about it.
8586038	8586778	But there's your plug.
8587219	8587859	Your early plug.
8588759	8589140	Let's see.
8589280	8591561	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype.
8592441	8592982	Orange Lodge Radio.
8593962	8595823	I saw some calls coming in, but I was mid-tweet.
8595883	8596683	So sorry, I didn't get them.
8598504	8598925	Let's see.
8599185	8600545	SSU100Matt sends a tweet.
8600886	8606769	I know you guys love your Disney, but what do you get when you mix Power Rangers and Mickey Mouse with Friends?
8608270	8610491	I don't know, what do you get when you mix all that together?
8611792	8613273	Apparently he links us to a story.
8613753	8615574	Bandai's official YouTube channel.
8615674	8620978	I thought we saw something like this previously, but the news article stated this week, so maybe it was something else.
8621338	8629344	But anyway, a teaser is up on Bandai's official YouTube channel promoting the upcoming ChoGatai King Mickey combiner set.
8630024	8631285	And this looks awesome here.
8631305	8632686	I'm going to play a little YouTube here.
8633166	8634487	This is a long YouTube.
8635047	8635628	Let's see if we can...
8638710	8640811	So yes, look at these little Mickey robots.
8641311	8643532	And then they're going to come together to form that.
8644332	8645293	That's kind of awesome.
8645453	8647434	That's a fun looking guest stop.
8647494	8650355	It's like a Mickey and a Daisy and a Donald.
8651996	8654517	Mickey meets Voltron.
8654997	8656398	Oh here, it's going through all the characters right now.
8656418	8656998	That was Mickey.
8657038	8657438	Minnie.
8657578	8658118	There's Minnie.
8658259	8660820	Is that like Disney group sex?
8660840	8662621	They look like the Vinyl Nations or something.
8662641	8663441	There's Donald.
8663461	8664802	Alright, we got calls coming in.
8664822	8665722	Let's try to take another call.
8666383	8667284	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8667304	8667685	Who's this?
8670808	8672731	Check it you, Jim Sally, Rob.
8672751	8673752	Hey, Jim Sally.
8673772	8674493	How you doing, buddy?
8675214	8676135	I'm doing pretty good.
8676175	8677236	I'm happy today.
8677336	8677977	I'm spicy.
8678037	8678598	I'm jolly.
8679179	8679779	I'm jingly.
8680080	8681121	Ho, ho, ho.
8681862	8683083	Ho, ho, ho, bitches.
8683304	8684605	I got hoes everywhere today.
8686852	8687373	Tasty Hoes.
8687413	8692617	Hey, speaking of hoes, man, I remember, I remember, no, speaking of hoes, man, you don't talk about hoes.
8693077	8706328	Listen, I remember playing Leisure Suit Larry on my fucking old 386 and remember when you got that first game and you found that prostitute and you take her to the back and you give it to her and you forgot to buy a condom and then your fucking shit falls off?
8706448	8707909	That's fucking awesome, man.
8708250	8709511	That's a life lesson I took.
8709791	8711112	I still use today, man, you know?
8711553	8715696	I think about Leisure Suit Larry and his shit falling off and I say, fuck, man, I shouldn't put something on my shit.
8715896	8717537	He's not making that up either.
8717617	8720238	That actually does happen in the first Leisure Suit Larry game.
8720278	8721318	You know what I remember?
8721879	8722179	What?
8722259	8728041	I think it was the remake, like the first remake of the first Leisure Suit Larry game, because Sierra did one.
8728101	8728941	Like the VGA one or whatever?
8728961	8730602	Yeah, like in the late, early 90s?
8730622	8735824	Yeah, the VGA version, but you had to take a quiz to prove you were 18 or over.
8735924	8736485	That's right!
8736545	8737405	Wasn't that the best?
8737725	8737925	Yes.
8737945	8739686	Oh my god, and that was before the internet, really.
8739926	8745390	Because seriously, we were all 16 and, you know, wanting to play and we were smart enough to figure out the questions.
8745430	8750734	It was like playing Jeopardy or something and it's like, instead of like winning money or something, you win boobs.
8751494	8751995	Boobs.
8752055	8753996	I don't even think they had, did they even show a boob in that game?
8754036	8754637	I can't remember.
8754657	8757579	Did they even show us a boob in that game?
8757619	8758019	I think so.
8759120	8762502	Do you remember at the end you had to give the girl an apple and she comes out of the hot tub?
8762863	8766485	Oh my god, to this day, to this day, I can't have apples in a hot tub.
8766525	8768086	I can't even remember if it was apples in a hot tub.
8768727	8769007	I suck.
8769355	8770476	I can't, man, I can't.
8770876	8773317	Well, I can, but it's not safe for children, see?
8774278	8775858	Like, you can't prove it, no.
8776098	8779860	And that's because, you know, Leisure Suit Larry was a great game, and it should be remade.
8780501	8787604	It was a game that taught me some life lessons that I needed to learn, and it's, I think, a game that should be mandatory for children to play.
8787824	8793287	But didn't you play the Leisure Suit Larry remake or whatever that was on the Xbox 360 like four years ago?
8793307	8793947	It was terrible.
8794308	8795228	Oh, it was terrible.
8795248	8796209	That was totally terrible.
8796849	8798970	Every game since the first ones were terrible.
8799332	8822734	but I do remember buying I bought one where it was love for sale I think and he was on a cruise ship and he came with a scratch and sniff book and as you play the game you can scratch and sniff shit like the lobster smelled horrible the lobster fucking smelled horrible at the bar I remember that he's not making this up like all that shit is totally true like there was a scratch and sniff edition yeah Jim Sally doesn't lie children I'm always 100% serious
8823908	8824689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8839915	8841076	Oh my god, I played that.
8841196	8844377	So I didn't know boobs looked as good as they did until I got older.
8844397	8847098	I thought they were all pixelated and squarey and stuff until I got older.
8847338	8849759	You know what I didn't talk about last week though, but it's totally true.
8849839	8855201	There was a male version of those games too, where the person you were playing with was a man.
8855902	8863905	For, you know, all those women out there that, you know, wanted to... Or the, you know, 10% of guys that wanted to, you know, have that version.
8865525	8866686	Women love stud poker.
8867881	8871242	Did you ever play, DarkSakura, did you ever play strip poker, the male version?
8872322	8872502	No.
8873963	8875823	Did you ever play the female version?
8877083	8878164	That's fucking hot.
8878184	8880844	I played the, we're drunk as hell, we don't know what version we're playing.
8881864	8884285	Oh, that's the beginning of a hot story.
8885345	8887286	Not really, because nobody was pretty.
8887306	8887946	That's hot.
8889186	8890227	Ho, ho, ho.
8890567	8891827	It's a little different when no one's pretty.
8892914	8894715	Oh, girl, everyone's pretty when you're drunk.
8896176	8901219	No, not everyone is pretty when you're drunk.
8901640	8903801	Some of us still maintain our aesthetic sensibilities.
8904361	8906463	Hey, hey, you should grow that hair out, JB.
8906783	8907663	Don't fucking kid yourself.
8907723	8908444	Hey, look.
8908959	8913602	Normally Jim Salley is a pretty liberal guy, and I love everybody, but fuck that shit.
8913662	8916924	Girls are supposed to have long hair, and boys are supposed to have short hair.
8917304	8918024	Fuck that shit.
8918405	8919285	Grow your hair out, girl.
8919325	8919905	You deserve it.
8920406	8922007	You look so beautiful with your long hair.
8922287	8923567	Put that shit in a ponytail.
8923588	8924868	Put it in two ponytails.
8924908	8925208	Fuck it.
8925228	8925889	You deserve it.
8926289	8929250	You know what I'm saying, girl?
8929270	8929830	Grow that hair out.
8930110	8930890	Rob, shut up, man.
8930910	8931370	Cut your hair.
8931390	8932610	It's too fucking long for you, Rob.
8932730	8933911	I have no hair left.
8933931	8935151	I don't know if you've seen pictures of me.
8935211	8939192	I was just reaching back and realizing that my hair actually does not touch my shoulders remotely.
8940272	8941192	It used to be longer.
8941252	8943773	It used to be, and then I cut it all off because I was sick of it.
8944273	8945233	I just got my hair cut today.
8945253	8945833	My hair's too curly.
8946113	8947194	I got mine cut on Friday.
8947734	8948434	What's left of it?
8949639	8951301	See, the boys know what they're doing, Jamie.
8951321	8951982	Girl that shit up.
8952002	8952803	You deserve it.
8953283	8954264	She ran to the potty.
8954325	8955406	This call made her throw up.
8955486	8955926	No, I'm kidding.
8957148	8961012	Alright, Jim Sally, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but do you have any other final thoughts?
8962394	8964837	Well, before I go, I just want to say
8965387	8966268	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8994864	8995785	You're like, what the fuck?
8995865	8999948	I was just giving you attention, I was being nice, and you're just a fucking asshole.
9000209	9006754	Our cat, we put the cat on the bed, not in the bed, that's not happening, but we just put the cat on the bed to try and pet the cat.
9007074	9007655	You know what she does?
9007735	9008336	Jumps right off.
9008716	9009116	Runs away.
9010718	9012179	She's afraid of the comforter.
9012559	9014441	For real, our cat is afraid of the comforter.
9014741	9015281	Thanks for watching!
9038177	9038457	DarkSakura.com
9057833	9059373	and make sure you declaw your pussy.
9060934	9062614	No, don't declaw your pussy.
9062634	9065975	Declawing is the feline equivalence of ripping out someone's fingernails.
9065995	9067056	I would never declaw a cat.
9067336	9069596	I'm not Loki.
9069816	9070977	Loki declawed his cat, I bet.
9072477	9074658	Alright, Jim Sally, I gotta let you go.
9074738	9075398	Have a good one, buddy.
9075418	9077659	Okay, everyone, love your pussies tonight.
9077939	9078459	Alright, will do.
9079039	9079339	Bye.
9080740	9081240	I'm choking.
9083060	9083660	On popcorn.
9084601	9084841	Yeah.
9085543	9086684	That call made me laugh very hard.
9086704	9088265	It's always a good time when Jim Sally calls in.
9089345	9089605	All right.
9090346	9097790	Extifer is saying in the chat room that I'm plugging other podcasts, but I haven't plugged Horde House, which is the show that Extifer's on.
9097850	9098330	So there you go.
9098670	9099551	A plug for Horde House.
9099611	9106355	The best little Horde House in Azeroth, or a show we call Horde House for short, is Wednesdays premiering on the VOG Network.
9107635	9107976	11 a.m.
9108036	9109196	Pacific, 2 p.m.
9109276	9113639	Eastern is the premiere, and then it's up on the podcast feed Wednesday nights at HordeHouse.com.
9114219	9131365	or of course, VOGnetwork.com if you're reloading it obsessively throughout the week then you'll see it posted on Wednesday nights alright I think that was it for tweets tonight too, I think I got them all that's that that's it for tweets nobody else is calling in
9132287	9133188	I think that's it for the show.
9133268	9135149	We're done a little early tonight, but you know what?
9135169	9136110	It's a slower news week.
9136971	9142115	DarkSakura has an appointment in the morning she wants to keep, so we're going to end it up early a little bit tonight.
9142495	9142675	Yeah.
9142695	9143816	So that's it.
9144797	9146878	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we say goodnight.
9147779	9149380	Loki, why don't you start us off with your final thought?
9150121	9151842	People need to come play on the Minecraft server.
9151862	9157526	Yes, I know that I can set up a day to have everybody come play, but seriously, there's like zero people on there other than me.
9158787	9159568	I checked the logs.
9159848	9161089	I know there's like nobody playing.
9162125	9169053	And I'm sure partly what that problem was because one day I left the server off because I was messing with something and forgot to turn it back on.
9169774	9169894	And...
9171810	9173411	The permissions were screwed up for a while there.
9173471	9174472	But they're all fixed now.
9174572	9175873	They're pretty much fixed.
9175973	9178154	And the mob arena works okay.
9178234	9179515	It's still really hard.
9179996	9183418	Even though I tried tweaking things to make it work better.
9183638	9186540	Apparently that classic bow plugin does not work.
9186860	9187681	I come to find out.
9189382	9192224	But I made it so you can spam fireballs now.
9192584	9193305	And that's kind of fun.
9193825	9195206	You still get your ass kicked though.
9195346	9197327	Even though you're throwing tons of fireballs at everything.
9198308	9199729	Those enemies are relentless.
9200009	9201250	And they will just come for you.
9202904	9203224	All right.
9204486	9207389	And my final thoughts since I'm being yelled at in chat about it.
9207669	9208049	You know what?
9208129	9208930	I'm just going to say this.
9209311	9211713	Support all indie podcasting.
9211773	9212734	Support them all.
9212934	9214216	Indie podcasts rock.
9214716	9218400	And a lot of people work very hard for very little money to make podcasts work.
9218440	9222985	And especially, may I call your attention to all the shows that are a part of the VOG Network.
