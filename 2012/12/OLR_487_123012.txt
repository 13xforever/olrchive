Tonight, December 30th, 2012, one console ends production.
Could adult movies really soon be on the Wii U?
And we look back at the best and worst of 2012.

DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I need to play more video games.
I've been slacking.
Kirby's Avalanche
No, Puyo Puyo.
Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Hi.
How are you, Loki?
I'm doing all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What's new with you?
Not much.
I mean, just watching a video of Grand Theft Auto.
Just thinking about it.
Even when you're not playing it, you're thinking about it.
It's cool.
Yeah, I am.
I noticed that you brought pizza with you to the show tonight.
The last OLR of 2012, by the way.
Actually, the last live VOG Network show of 2012.
Not the last VOG show of 2012, because we do have taped programming tomorrow, but the last live show of 2012 tonight.
So you brought pizza, and you said it's Pepperoni 4.0?
They call it Roundtable's Pepperoni 4.0.
It's not very good, but...
because they're like, oh, hey, we're going to put a bunch of pepperoni on there.
Yeah, I thought it'd be a lot of pepperoni, but it's just like that.
Really, the thing that ruins is their primo pepperoni.
It's the one that's like, it looks like salami and it kind of tastes like salami.
Maybe it is salami.
It's not salami, but it tastes sort of, it's either saltier and spicier.
It just kind of tastes off.
The rest of them taste pretty good, but they have like these.
I don't know.
It's almost like the full currency of pepperonis.
They have the salami-shaped pepperonis.
They have the smaller, regular-sized pepperonis.
They have the pepperonis you would find at Papa Murphy's or whatever.
Honestly, Loki, I look at that and I go, I want a veggie.
Pepp4roni
All right.
Well, we do have another guest with us tonight live in studio, a makeup visit, if you will.
Say hello, everybody, to the VOG leaderboard, undoubtable winner for the whole damn year.
I don't know.
The month's not over yet.
A lot can happen in a couple days, but for the whole year, I'm sure.
Say hello, everybody, to Flaco Jones.
Hi everybody.
Hi Flocko, how are you?
I'm doing great.
Yeah?
I think Tigerclaw has more points.
If you just take points for the whole year, I'm pretty sure he's got the most points.
Oh, then maybe.
But a number of times on the leaderboard, then yes, that's me.
Bobby has to figure all that shit out in the next couple days.
I don't envy him for that.
But nevertheless, a great showing on the VOG Network leaderboards this year.
So thanks for playing.
Thank you.
I'm the winner.
Yes, you get to come on the show tonight and just gloat.
That's my prize.
A winner is you.
Congratulations.
Well, maybe we'll get, like, Tigerclaw to call in or somebody else to call in at the end of the show and do a little gloating.
I want to hear from Immortal King, too, because he's been neck and neck with you the past couple months.
Yeah, yeah.
He had a 20-point head start right at the beginning.
Well, he's...
That'd be a great trophy.
Well, welcome back to the show.
For those that don't know, here's the deal.
Flaco Jones joined us for a show earlier this year.
I want to say it was around June, right?
It was in May.
It was in May?
Yeah.
Close enough.
That was a month off.
So you were here for a show back in May, and we were doing the show, and we got to the classic game of the week, which is always right at the end of part A, right?
And that's right when the power went out!
Right in the middle of me talking.
Flocko's back!
Yay, I'm back.
Well, the problem was I moved in June.
I moved away from Sacramento.
So I live like an hour away now.
So that was what made it so hard to get back.
That's right.
You drove an hour all the way just to be here tonight.
Well, I had really good traffic, so I actually drove like 45 minutes.
Maybe you sped a little bit.
A little bit, but nobody got me.
All right.
So, I want to talk to you a little bit about you and the types of games you play and all that stuff.
What kind of video games are you into?
What kind of gamer are you?
Console gamer, PC gamer, MMO player?
I'm a console gamer.
I mean, I do play some stuff on PC and I do like WoW a lot.
but I still consider myself mainly a console gamers those are the games I prefer and I tend to like games that have a really good story and gameplay still got to be good but if the story is good enough if it's really really good I can kind of sometimes forego some gameplay elements and I just go for story games because I went to film school to be a screenwriter and so I'm all sucked up in the story and I love games like Bioshock and I love RPGs they always are really good really deep story so
So you must be really into Walking Dead these days, because that's a game that's got to... I finally... We'll get into gaming weeks later, but I finally got exposed to Walking Dead this past week, and a very well-written game.
Yeah, yeah.
I was waiting on that.
I bought that one just a couple weeks ago.
I was waiting until it all had come out, and I heard...
They did a good job.
I want to make sure they did a good job before I bought it because that started coming out, I think, in April or something.
And I wasn't willing to just buy that now and then hope that the rest would come out and still be good or anything like that.
So I waited until the whole thing came out and I bought the season pass, even though the season's over.
But they still gave the $5 off one of the games.
Well, there was a great sale on Xbox this week where all the...
Thanks for watching!
That's all right.
Telltale's done a lot of great stuff the past couple years.
I mean, their only game that was kind of and was Jurassic Park.
But a lot of the, I mean, even then, I mean, I haven't played it, so I'm really going off of what I hear on the internet.
But even then, Jurassic Park has its people that are like, it's not as bad as you guys make it out to be.
Thanks, Rob.
Now that song is stuck in my head again.
What?
Jurassic Park is frightening.
Yeah.
Or the actual theme song.
Jurassic Park.
The Weird Al one.
Alright, whatever.
Let's see, what else?
You used to work in the video game industry, right?
Yeah, I was a video game tester for Konami.
You were the tester.
I was the tester.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I did that and I was like, that was really fun.
So I started looking up video game testing job opportunities and I found Konami and I went and interviewed and I thought I did a horrible interview and I went home and they called me back and said, you got the job.
Well, seeing how Konami's been doing the past couple of years.
No, but this was just a while ago.
This is when Konami was doing a lot of really quality stuff, right?
Well, they were still, I mean, they still had Metal Gear stuff, but the stuff, you know.
You were there during the period of a lot of, and this is all common knowledge at this point, I don't think there's any secrets anymore.
You were in the office that has since closed, right?
Yes, Redwood Shores, I believe.
But you were out of there before that happened, right?
Just before they moved to LA, but everyone knew they were leaving.
X-Box, DDR, Ultramix
and Frogger was the first game I worked on it was like the Frogger DS game and there was like a Frogger you know what screw you screw you for all of that you should have told him this sucks don't put it on just let it die let it die you know I prefer to work on those games other than what they started cranking out while I was there which were really crappy licensed games where they would get licensed off of Saturday morning cartoons and do that and I was like the head man for some reason
Because I took it with such, oh gosh, such enthusiasm.
I became the Winx Club guy.
It was a very small game, so they only needed like one or two people to work on it at a time.
So I was the expert in all things Winx.
And I took it and I was like, I'm going to roll with this.
I watched the first season of the show and I was writing up bugs about continuity problems.
It's like, oh no, she wouldn't say that before she went on her first date with Skye because...
DarkSakura.com
I have kids now and I was watching Nickelodeon the other day and the Winx Club is on Nickelodeon now and it's all computer animated.
It looks weird.
And the voices are all different.
There was a British chick on that show and now she's not British.
She's just another purple haired girl.
And now they have another Winx game.
Is it another Konami Winx game?
No, it's not Konami anymore.
It's D3.
Oh, Konami lost the license.
Sorry, guys.
Ironically though, the guy that was my Konami rep at the time, who was selling the Winx game, is now working for D3, selling the Winx game.
So it's hilarious.
Oh god, that's even worse than Flaco.
Flaco just kind of got assigned to it, yet this guy has been following it, right?
Well, for him, he said it was alright, because we've sold these in the past.
He's all, I know about this franchise, because I had to sell it before, so...
I'm selling it again Konami made a lot of Winx games I assume they were selling that's kind of like one of the guys I worked under over there he was like you know it's kind of a that's that's where the industry or at least where Konami was going was like why put a bunch of money into a new IP that might not sell if you can just buy a license and the parents are going to walk in dig well Toys R Us and buy that game for their kid because like oh my kid watches that show I'll just buy it and they don't even care about the game that's a lot of what kind of goes on in the industry heck yeah I mean it's
For better or for worse, I mean, The Walking Dead, again, terrific game that happens to be based on a license.
It worked in that scenario.
Although, I want to say, isn't there like a first-person shooter game as well?
There's one.
Activision's put one out.
But let me say, the bar's not very high for that one.
And I'm worried that people are going to get confused.
The Walking Dead game from Telltale is based on the comic.
The first-person shooter is going to be based on the show, which is based on the comic.
So it kind of dilutes itself a little bit.
So let me ask you something, Jim.
Do songs like this give you PTSD?
Oh my gosh.
That was... I feel worse... They still have the song, too.
Of course.
Well, you know, I didn't hear... I didn't catch the beginning when I watched Nickelodeon, but I feel worse for the people that worked at E3 and had to work right next to the Winx booth because that song played on a loop all the time.
At least when I did E3, I had to do... I got to showcase Pro Evolution, whatever it's called, soccer.
You got to do a manly soccer game.
It was winning 11-11 at the time, but I think they were dropping the winning 11 title because it sounded really stupid with 11 behind it.
But yeah, it's...
that song played on a loop like crazy Shane's in chat saying Jim, remember when we worked on the PS2 PC1 that wasn't so bad to play
No, I have that game.
Are you going to show your kids someday?
I will.
I have a little emulator on my phone, and I have the Game Boy version on that, and I've showed my kids that version.
Even my son doesn't mind it.
He likes it.
If you press and hold the X button, Bloom charges up her flame attack, and it shoots out, and it's a pretty animation, so my son likes that.
But yeah, I have the PC version.
I think I tried to show it to a bunch of friends, and they were like, this is horrible.
out of all the games we played that was the best one out of all the Winx games it was the most like a game and then later on they just started making mini game collections that were horrible yeah really bad but the first couple games they actually tried to make real games and then like oh we don't need to do that let's save even more money just make mini games
Alright, I guess some of our live listeners... You carry a curse with you, apparently, Flocko, because, you know, you shut off the power that one time.
Apparently, some of our live listeners are getting dropped right now.
I don't know what's up, but... And that hasn't happened for a while, has it?
It hasn't happened ever since we got the new router, I don't know.
So, turn off your porn torrents, everybody.
I'm cursed.
It's because I brought two mobile devices.
Well, also, I want to point out, I'm showing that the feed is still going, and we haven't had... Usually, if we have a big drop, I see it.
It goes disconnect, da-da-da-da-da, and like... But we're...
We're okay for right now, so we'll see.
All right.
Anyhow.
Oh, now there it goes.
There's the reconnect.
Good times.
Live radio.
What can you do?
We are going to press forward best we can.
No one ever gets to hear me tell my story.
But no, you'll have it on the podcast.
No, that's good.
Damn you, Konami.
I think they're the ones shutting me down.
Oh, he's talking about the wigs.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
Do you think they're DDoSing us right now?
Yes.
Alright, let me tell the chatters to calm down.
Alright.
Untwist your panties, everybody.
The world is fine.
Alright.
Anyhow, barring a power outage, which you never know might happen.
Alright, so you did the testing stuff for a while.
You did the Winx, you did Frogger, you didn't do DDR, but okay, you did some of this cool stuff.
A little Metal Gear.
But you don't do game industry stuff anymore, right?
No, no, I got out of that when I graduated film school and...
Thanks for watching!
Try not to get killed and make movies.
And in this whole very interesting, it's a small world type of thing, you married Extover's sister.
Yes.
From Horde House.
Extover from Horde House.
So he's my brother-in-law.
The guy who comes on here and talks about all sorts of nasty stuff.
That's awesome, though.
Bleached assholes.
Yes, there we go.
I was going to say that.
Who doesn't do any of that in real life around, especially family and stuff?
Oh, no.
Yeah, yeah.
Never.
Never.
That's why he gets it out.
Yeah.
He has Tourette's, but it only takes place when he's doing a podcast.
Well, that's not true.
Usually when he's hanging out with friends, too.
Or when he's at a theme park on a roller coaster.
So the game testing stuff for you was just kind of like a bridge from one thing to another, right?
It was a college job, really.
I was not the kind of guy who could go to school and not work because I had to pay for my rent and everything.
I didn't have a ton of financial aid, so I had to have a full-time job.
So it was crazy because I lived in... Well, it's kind of confusing to say this to people who don't know, but I lived...
in Concord, and I worked in Redwood City, and I went to school in San Francisco.
So on Thursdays, especially, I do this like Triangle of Doom where I took Bart to Caltrain and went all the way down to Redwood City.
It was like hours on commuting just to go back and forth.
I'd leave the house at like 6 in the morning and get home at 5.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right.
Well, people do what they gotta do.
Let me ask this.
What kind of, like, are there any, like, really funny stories about, like, what might have happened, like, going into your favorite game?
Like, crazy testing behind-the-scenes story, like, you know, not safe for work type things?
Gosh, I don't want to, like, throw anybody under the bus.
Don't say their name.
Some people, you know, if... Unless it was Shane, then by all means, say his name.
We would, we would, it was, it was a nice relaxed like workplace.
It wasn't, I heard Sony was like a, was like a sweatshop, but I don't know.
I didn't really work there, but I heard it was like a sweatshop and it wasn't fun, but we would go out on lunch and we get some drinks and we come back and it's like, oh, it's post lunch nap time.
And look at all these DDR pads make wonderful blankets and you know, just stuff like that.
But you know, I'm drinking with my boss.
I
So if they're drinking, then, like, well, it's not bad if I drink on the job, kind of, or at lunch break.
So, yeah, we would come back.
But we always got our work done.
That's all that mattered, right?
And some jobs allow you to drink, technically, on the job.
Like, especially if you are the type of person that entertains clients.
Yeah.
Well, I assume it wasn't, like, a... A prostitute?
I just assumed, because my superiors did it, that it wasn't against Konami's rules.
So I was going to be blissful.
You know, technically, we're all temps anyway, so...
Were there any girls?
There were a couple girls.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's good.
Some of them I still know, like Facebook friends with and Twitter friends and whatnot.
Was it kind of a fraternity environment?
That's what I hear about some testing things.
I mean, even though there were girls too, they're just some of the bros too, right?
Yeah, I guess a little bit.
I don't think it was too crazy there.
I don't know.
Maybe I hung out with the wrong crowd, but I had friends who were girls, friends who were gay, and it didn't seem like it was too much of a frat house thing.
Well, I don't mean necessarily like... I didn't know if it was like that company you talked about a couple weeks ago where they had strippers at their holiday party.
It wasn't like that.
That's a holiday party.
That's for the best.
I mean, I don't know.
I mean, it was definitely like a fun place to work, but it wasn't a total... I mean, yeah, it was a lot of guys there, but it wasn't like that Adam Sandler Mama's Boy movie.
We weren't all like that.
I just want to say you told me a story one time and I don't remember if it was on the show or not on the show.
Maybe this was even you about some guy who came to work with no pants on or something.
Oh, that was not me.
So I don't know.
We did have a guy who come to work and I had a friend who worked there and he noticed this and he had to tell me.
He's like, we had a guy who came to work.
He wore like just a white undershirt basically for a shirt.
And my friend would tap me on the shoulder.
He's like, I hate it when he wears that shirt because all I can stare at are his big, dark Asian nipples.
Yeah.
I wish you would put a darker shirt on because I hate staring at his big dark Asian nipples.
So yeah, but I don't know about anyone who came to work without any pants on.
See, once again, I was probably not hanging out with the right crowd.
Shane is yelling out in chat who it was, but since I don't want to, I got to be careful.
Are you in the chat room?
Okay, yeah, I am now.
I guess I wasn't.
Okay.
Okay.
TigerClaw asks, during your time as a tester, did the company make you do some testing that was out of the ordinary?
I'm not sure how to take that question.
What would be considered... You know what?
One thing that they asked me to do that was kind of cool actually was I got to take a dev kit home because we had to test Metal Gear online and they wanted to test it with people's different service providers and stuff like that.
And so it was a big deal.
I had to sign up for paperwork.
Maybe I shouldn't talk about it, but whatever.
I'd sign a bunch of paperwork and take the system home and actually got to test Metal Gear 3 online from home and that was really fun and like no one's supposed to be there of course my roommate was right there he's like oh this is awesome like be quiet yeah exactly we get on a conference call and we would all talk and then we were playing with the Japanese uh
Playtesters 2 and they were like just murdering us because they'd already gotten to test the game.
We were just testing online functionality really.
They'd already tested it over in Japan.
We didn't get the AAA titles in Redwood City usually.
It was those like Metal Gear stuff that was done in Japan.
That's not so secretive.
That's not that bad.
At the time, you know, people want to know everything about a game like that and yeah, you gotta be careful.
But I don't remember ever being like told to test something like in some weird way.
I don't know.
But yeah, it was just taking it home.
That was kind of cool but I didn't expect to ever be able to do testing at home.
uh Ragenator says paternity testing would be testing us out of the ordinary he's not on the Mori show Ragenator yeah I didn't have to do any of that like I'm trying to think because the only the one story that always sticks out with me is just because the game was so terrible was that 25 to life and how like you know bad that game was or whatever and you were telling oh my gosh that's right crime life I think it was crime life I'm sorry yeah that was a game I didn't test it
But in the downtime, when I didn't get laid off, the next time there was downtime, they kind of have you just test games that are already out and really buggy or they just have old builds of.
And so to keep our skills, you know, kind of tight.
So Crime Life was a game where it was a Grand Theft Auto ripoff, I guess.
But you could throw like every box into this one room and then trigger a cutscene.
And the guys are like, they get stuck trying to walk through like a million boxes.
And that game was so bad.
Like, I don't think it was ever released.
I think it was just released in Europe.
No, it came out on an Xbox.
It came out on an Xbox, but yeah, it was very delayed.
I don't know anything about that game.
I just know it was terrible.
You know, despite all these extreme stories we're telling and so forth, you seem very positive and happy about the whole experience.
Would you say that you had a good experience doing that whole thing?
Yeah, that was one of my favorite jobs I've ever had.
My favorite, I guess, odd job that I've ever had that I had to go through to get myself through college.
I worked there for like two years.
However, my friend pays his bills by being a video game strategy guide writer.
Hey, whatever does it.
They wrote the one for Mass Effect 3.
He says he can't play that game anymore.
So... You gotta do what you gotta do.
There's a lot of playing the same game, but it's just how you deal with that.
And if you just have fun with it.
Like I said, I had fun with the Winx.
I was put on this game that... Yeah, you had a positive attitude about it.
You're like, I get to be lead tester, even if it's the Winx.
I don't care.
Yeah, if you don't have a positive attitude, then yeah, that job could be horrible because you could just be like...
Oh, I'm playing Frogger, and this is something I had to do in Frogger that was kind of annoying, and maybe this goes back to that question Tigerclaw had, was they're like, we have all this time to test still, now jump on every tile in the game.
So every square, every tiny little piece that you could jump on,
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You can achieve anything.
That's right.
Believe in your dreams.
The more you know.
All right.
Well, thank you, Flacco, for giving us a little bit of the 10-year-old behind-the-scenes dirt.
We appreciate it.
So now you're doing other stuff.
You're doing stuff that's a little more with the film.
Yeah, yeah.
Education and video, telecourses, ITV classes, things like that.
It's...
It's pretty fun.
And I know your wife is a teacher, too, so you're like a whole little teaching family.
We all work in education, and her oldest brother does as well.
He's a teacher.
Her parents were teachers.
It's a very education-based family.
So when I got to work at a school, I'm like, oh, this is cool.
Yeah.
I get to hear all their war stories, and now I have some of my own.
Though I'm not a teacher, but still, I interact with faculty and students and stuff.
Pretty cool.
Very cool.
Very cool.
All right.
Well, you know, stay a while and comment on the news with us.
And when we get into the second half of the show tonight, we're going to talk a lot about the best and worst of the year.
So you'll definitely be talking along with us there.
And at the end of the show tonight, we're going to let you finally make up the segment that was forever lost with your classic game of the week.
Because Jamie wasn't here that week.
So we let you do the classic game of the week.
So she has her own game this week, but we're going to let you do your make up.
Teaching is cool if you have the patience
Did you ever find a bug in a game you tested that was never fixed upon release?
I actually have an answer for this, and it was a Winx game, and this is like... Hurry up and go download it, Tiger Claw.
Yeah, Game Boy Advance game, and it was towards the end of the game, and it was a really horrible bug, and it was very hard to reproduce.
It took me... I had to try to reproduce it like a hundred times, and I got it like...
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
and they thought they'd fixed it but then customer service got a call about it after the game had been released and this little girl was trying to play the game and it happened to her and she was stuck and I was like the customer service person came and asked is there any way out of this and I was like
There isn't.
That is a game-killing bug.
Sucks to be you, little girl.
But it must have been an insane chance.
Because it's very rare they have you test something like a hundred times.
But it was such a big bug that I tried to do it.
And if I couldn't get it to happen one out of a hundred, then they're like, okay, then we'll release it.
And I felt so bad because some poor little girl.
You tried, but because you didn't try hard enough, some little girl's Winx dreams were shattered.
I did try 500 times.
She threw that Game Boy Advance at the TV, at the dog.
Yeah, if you restarted from that save point, you would still be bugged and you couldn't complete the game because a door wouldn't open for you because you could just walk right through it and then it wouldn't trigger the rest of the level.
It's not the first game to have something like that.
Zelda or some shit had that too.
Remember how they had to put out that fix on the Wii?
I heard about that.
The Zelda patch channel.
Bubble Bobble.
Yeah, no boss on level 30 in Bubble Bobble.
There's worse things that have happened.
Or the Cardfighters ones.
All right.
We're going to get into the news and all that good stuff.
We just wanted to say there was no show last week.
Sorry about it.
But, you know, it was the holidays.
I think a lot of your favorite podcasts didn't end up doing a show.
We had a lot of stuff going on.
Also, we hope you guys had a safe holiday.
And also, Happy New Year and all that good stuff because we won't be doing another show until it is 2013.
So we want to wish you all a Happy New Year.
and a safe new year.
Remember guys, if you're going to drink and drive, plan in advance what is going to be your way to get home safely.
Do not drink and drive.
Get somebody sober, get a hotel, get a taxi, whatever you got to do.
All right, let's get into how our gaming weeks were.
I know I had a very busy gaming week, but let's start with DarkSakura.
How was your gaming week?
I played Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
Kicking it old school.
Yeah, and then I realized, wait, why the crap am I trying to play this with a keyboard when I could just hook up the Nomad and play it on the Genesis?
So, anyway, that was one thing that I tried to play, and I did play some more of that stupid fairy solitaire game because it's stupid and addicting and stupid.
Did I say stupid?
Because it's really stupid.
Um, and, uh, oh yeah, I did play some Mass Effect.
Actually, I played a lot of Mass Effect.
And I played, um, WoW, like for about 15 minutes.
And, um, I bought some games.
I got Limbo and I got Closure.
I think I got Closure, though, before last week.
which is a neat game that uses light to create your platforms or whatever the light shines on is what actually exists if there's no light on it it doesn't exist so if you step back outside your spotlight you'll fall through the ground and you can either fall into another level or you can fall to your death
Yeah, that's part of it.
I bought Assassin's Creed 2, which is the only game in that series that I ever really, you know, care about.
Because it's set in Renaissance Italy.
And just, I don't know, I kind of want to gank a Dometici.
You know, wouldn't that be fun?
Do you know who the Domenichis were?
You shook your head.
The Domenichis hired Michelangelo to design defenses for their house.
Not Michelangelo, Leonardo.
One of those two.
And I remember one of them used to mumble to himself in one of the Domenichis' diaries.
And a bunch of them were popes, and they also were persecuted during the Bonfire of the Vanities.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I finally bothered working on Flycam so now I've been going around getting compromising screen captures of my characters shooting things and lasers and stuff and I finally figured out now how to get Flycam to work in the cinematics so that's going to be even better lots of fun screens and sort of speaking of video games MassAffecting.tumblr.com picking up some steam there you go speaking of steam more stuff needs to go on sale the end
Loki, how was your gaming week?
I bought a lot of things.
Ironically, though, nothing from Steam.
I mean, it is on Steam, but it's not from Steam, so that's a weird thing.
It's like, because Steam had a bunch of stuff on sale, but you know who else had stuff on sale?
Amazon.
Amazon had a ton of shit on sale, and they had a ton of bundles on sale for...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then I bought something else because I've been talking about it for a long time now.
I'm just like, you know, for that price, I can't pass that up.
So I bought and actually played a good 13 hours of Final Fantasy XI and it's definitely different from when I was playing it before.
I didn't know what the fuck was going on and seriously, it's a ghost town there.
and here's the funniest part I actually tweeted about this because I was trying to get a few other people to buy it it was down to five bucks for everything like the game and all of the expansions five dollars well they're ramping up they just announced the release of the next expansions like the end of March or something so they're probably just trying to get a lot of people that will want to buy the expansion full price
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Not even necessarily just from the book burning and stuff.
I didn't really do that that much because there's no one... You know how you were saying go do the book burning with parties and stuff?
There's no one there.
There's no one there.
They're all gone.
In Gusken Mines?
In Gusken Mines.
There's no one there.
They're all like level 99 and stuff.
So there's no one to book burn with.
So I kind of did it a little bit through one of the tombs or whatever right next to Ranford.
But...
A little delayed reaction from DarkTetsuya in our chatroom.
Wait, what?
Loki went back to Final Fantasy XI?
Yep.
I don't know if it's going to... I mean, I don't know if I'm actually going to pay for it, but I'm playing for the 30 days at the very least because, you know, I got it for $10.
And so I'm going to check it out.
And it's just... I kind of wanted to have it because I do think it's going to go free-to-play and I just want to be ready for when that happens.
FifthDream in chat got it on your recommendation.
Yeah.
So you weren't alone.
Yeah, so good.
But seriously, there's like no one around.
I mean, there's...
I was doing just checks of different places like the dunes there's like 19 people there maybe nobody levels there anymore no one that's that's just not just there there's no one place where people are like I was like okay guys guys in mines okay there's probably people there nope there's like 10 people there huh or like you know there's just it's just a ghost town
What I usually do, I go in, or that time, that month or two that I was on it, you zone in the Gusken Mines, see if there's anybody fighting right at the very start, like once you run past the initial cave, and just do a say.
Please invite to, they don't call it raid, what do they call it?
Alliance or something.
Please invite to alliance or whatever.
Party, can I have it?
You know, the whole auto-translate thing.
And they'll just invite you right into the party.
That's how it goes.
So even if there's only 10 people in there, if they're all doing the leveling thing...
I'm also not high enough level to do that because I'm only level 17 right now 17 is a great level for that trust me, people start doing it at 12 I don't know, it's just all new to me so right now I'm just soloing and I'm just going to probably try to get up to 20 so I can get my subclass thing going and do all that stuff and by that time it'll be the end of January and then they'll quit because I don't want to pay 13 bucks a month for it but um
It's interesting, and like I said, it's very different.
I don't know what's going on anymore.
Playing it on the computer now versus what you had five years ago, I'm sure, is a big shock, too.
Well, yeah, I can max out everything, and I play on a controller, so I do that.
I mean, I have my macros still, but since I'm playing it on my laptop, I just use my macros on my keyboard, and I play everything else on my Xbox 360 controller.
I used to have all of my macros done through my top two triggers.
Yeah, it's just, I could do that too, but I just don't want to, I mean, I just, it's a lot easier for me just to, you know, take my hand off the controller and do, you know, control one, control two, or whatever, so I've just been doing that, and, um, I don't know, uh,
I've noticed some new things floating around.
There's all these pixies.
I don't know where the hell those are, but I pick fights with them and kill them.
Although it's weird, though, because I was resting one time and one of them healed me.
Yeah, they come by and they heal you and they randomly raise you, like if you're dead.
Oh, well, I've been just pissing them off and trying to kill them.
Way to go.
Fuck you!
I'm going to kill you!
I agree with Acidic Vampire.
It's boring and it's a chore.
I was just going to read his comment.
Acidic Vampire says, I went back to Final Fantasy XI a few months ago but stopped.
It did get boring and it was more of a chore than entertaining.
Yeah, that's what I'm kind of thinking too because there's not anyone on there.
But like I said, just want to get the software and get it downloaded and check it out just for a little bit just because I was curious.
$10, I mean that's less than a month of actually paying for it.
$5 if you got lucky, that's even better.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't know.
It's all right.
It's just I wish there was someone to play with, and there's really no one around.
I mean, it's just empty.
I'd love to come play, but if I hadn't burned myself out on it a couple months ago.
No, seriously.
It's just very, very empty.
And I know you can get AI characters or whatever to help you out.
I'm not really sure how that works.
I don't either.
I think...
Something like I said, I don't really know what's going on in the game at all.
And I was like trying to remember what I'm supposed to be doing as far.
I mean, I know we're the kind of level and stuff before, but I was trying to remember like what I'm supposed to be doing as far as like, you know, the I know there's some, you know, Sendoria quests and stuff that you can do and just I don't know it.
I'm enjoying it somewhat.
It's just kind of good to just play it and let my mind just kind of go because there's really no... But there's literally no one around.
I was just running around and I run across a couple people and that's it.
And even buying stuff from the auction houses, stuff you need is just not there because there's no one there.
Out of curiosity, is this getting you jazzed for Final Fantasy XIV?
Nope.
Just thought I'd try.
I mean, I saw a video of it.
It looks nice.
No, I'd rather honestly, when Final Fantasy XIV comes out, I'd rather wait for this to go free play and play this instead.
Because this seems like it'd be more interesting.
I mean, XIV looks alright, but I'm sure it's not going to run that great on my laptop.
I mean, it'll run alright on my laptop, but it's just not going to be as smooth and I don't know how many people are going to be playing it
It looks nice, though.
I mean, it's just... I like Eleven.
I don't know.
It's Eleven that I dedicate a lot of time to.
Okay, so anyways, enough with Eleven.
Yes, enough with Eleven.
Other things I've been playing.
I actually played Borderlands 2.
I went back to that.
So I've been playing co-op with my co-worker.
So we've been playing through that.
And it's actually pretty awesome.
So we got a little bit through the storyline.
We finally met up with... Oh, who the fuck is it?
The little girl that's crazy.
I don't remember her name.
Anyways...
Tiny Tina Tiny Tina Tiny Tina
and so she and then she's like okay signal me when you want me to fire these or whatever and she's like I got tired of waiting so I fired it anyways and it blows up the train track and then she's just like
The humor and the dialogue in the game is just awesome.
So that's pretty cool.
And we're just playing through that a little bit.
And what else did I play this week?
Modern Warfare 3, a little bit more of that still.
I got this device called a MOGA, which is from a company called PowerA.
They were actually giving them away for one day as part of the Secret Santa promotion thing.
And so, basically, what a MOGA is, it's this Bluetooth controller for an Android phone.
And what's kind of cool about it, though, is it has this little, like, slot that... Or this little clasp that you can kind of adjust to fit your phone.
And you play, like, a handheld gaming pad.
And it looks kind of similar to, like, a...
Xbox 360 controller crossed with a classic controller because they've got the analog placements of the Xbox 360.
There's no D-pad, although the left analog kind of has this diamond thing on it where it kind of does it eight way.
It has it where you can kind of do it almost like eight direction on it to make it a little bit easier.
And then, of course, you know, the X, Y, A, B buttons and two shoulder buttons are
And what's kind of cool is it came with some games with it.
It came with Modern Combat 4, which I haven't been able to download yet because my phone... The way they have it partitioned, I've got like 16 gigs on it, but 2 gigs of it is dedicated to apps.
And there's no easy way to download something to that open...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, this would probably help.
I mean, and this thing normally, I mean, if I didn't get it for free, it would have cost me 50 bucks.
But I think it's worth it.
And if you have a tablet or whatever, it will work wirelessly with your tablet because it's Bluetooth.
There you go.
Which is kind of awesome.
So, you know, if you're looking for a controller, that might not be a bad one to pick up.
And it's pretty small, too.
It fits in your pocket.
So I had that.
And what else did I play this week?
I don't know.
I have a lot of games.
Like I said, I bought stuff on Steam sales and stuff.
I'm hopefully going to give away for some games that I already have or games I just don't want to play.
And so we'll figure out a way to do that soon.
And yeah.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, I want to move on with our gaming weeks, but I want to say hello to somebody else who's joining us in studio who's kind of been walking in and out, which he's allowed to do because it's his place too.
Everybody say hello to Alan.
Hello.
How you doing, Alan?
Good.
I'm sorry I was sick last week and closed down the OLR studio with my Ebola.
But you're feeling much better now, right?
Yes.
I had a head cold for six days.
I don't recommend it.
How did you finally cure yourself of the Ebola super yucky barf?
You just wait six days until your immune system gets rid of it.
There's really nothing I can do.
I bought this spray for my nose that felt like acid.
That wasn't fun.
It worked.
I could breathe afterwards because I think it burned out my skull.
Do you blame Obamacare for making you sick?
I'm just kidding, don't answer that.
I blame coworkers.
Alright, fair enough.
Alright, let's talk about your gaming week.
So you were sick, so that's a great chance for you to play lots of games.
Nothing like being sick on Christmas.
What did you play?
I was...
I only played three games really the last couple weeks wow this is more a discussion for Horde House but I have no problems at all with this expansion Pandaria but the magic has been gone for me since like this summer so I haven't been playing it nearly as much as I should but I got played some wow I played some Mass Effect 2 and I played some Walking Dead
So, Mass Effect 2, okay, we've heard a lot about Mass Effect on the show, but you do like this mod thing, right, with high-res textures?
Well, I'm on my third character.
She is my female paragon, which is kind of like a good guy, because my first woman that I played was a renegade, which is more kind of an asshole.
so it's my third career and yeah I have all these high res textures for Mass Effect 2 that the community has made and they look awesome but the only problem is is that when you load them up it takes it literally I have to start it up and walk away and it takes the game 15 minutes to load so I if I want to play Mass Effect 2 I gotta give at least an hour to 90 minutes time because if I'm gonna let the game load for 20 minutes I can't just do a mission and sign off it's a waste of time you have way too much patience
Well, I can alt-tab and look at Chrome or mess with my phone.
Tumblr, Tumblr.
Yeah.
Let's talk about Walking Dead.
That's a game we haven't talked a lot about on this show, but you checked it out this week.
What did you think?
I don't want to steal your thunder, but it was nice.
I was spoiled because I am on Tumblr a lot.
When episode 5 came out within a day, all of the animated GIFs and YouTube clips and just discussions were going on my dash about what happens in the ending of chapter 5.
So I was like, oh, that ending looks...
I'm not gonna say anything about it but I was like I guess I should say that now that I know how it ends and how everyone is losing their shit over how it ends in a good way so I just and then also I saw you playing it and the fact it was 10 bucks on XBLA right and it was 12 bucks for the season pass on Steam and like Steam of course is having its we hate you and we want you to be poor sale so that's a good name for it so despite the fact that you know you had the ending already ruined for you of episode 5 how did you enjoy playing through episode 1
It was good.
I'm trying to juggle between being a perfectionist and wanting to play it with a fact open just so I can see all the different ways I can control the story in later chapters, which I know is cheating, but I don't have that kind of time.
I don't care.
And also just wanting to be a contrarian because I wanted to do stuff that was opposite of what you were doing so that I can say, oh, well, if you do this, then this is what happens instead.
Because you have an iPhone and I have an Android because I'm different like that.
so yeah I was like I wanted I'm trying to juggle between having things be as good as possible for my character but also wanting to do like backwards ass backwards stuff doesn't that sound like somebody you want to date guys somebody that does intentionally the opposite of everything that you do just in video games and he has an Android and I have an iPhone yeah clearly he's smarter than you hey fuck off all right
so anyway, sorry, didn't mean to steal your thunder if I'm gonna mimic everything you do when you play, I should just sit behind you and watch you play myself, I'm gonna have different people live than you do, and I'm gonna do, yeah alright, that's fair but you do recommend it?
yeah
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
Tiny Tower.
Sucks.
No, I'm kidding.
All right.
We'll move on.
So you're going to come back for Part B and talk about Game of the Year and all that with us, right?
Yes.
Okay.
We'll see you then.
For now, Flaco, how was your gaming week?
I had a very busy gaming week because I have the week off of work and I'm not playing WoW right now because WoW eats up a lot of time.
I love it, but I just wanted to really focus on console stuff this week, so I played more Ni No Kuni demo.
I just play it because my son likes to watch it because it's a cartoon and then I like playing it too and so it gives me an excuse.
I finished The Walking Dead after Christmas.
I took Christmas off of playing it because Extifer was in town and he didn't want to see how it ended so I waited and I waited and as soon as he left I finished playing it.
And it was great.
It was a great game.
And I feel so bad that Alan got spoiled on the ending because I think that really helps not knowing what's going to happen.
I think I know what happens, but I'm really trying to keep myself spoiler-free, and I'm just kind of trying to forget I heard that and just taking the game at face value.
But I'm still really enjoying Episode 1 so far, personally.
I thought I knew what happened, and luckily I was wrong.
Oh, okay, cool.
So, yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Would this be something that would be alright for someone that doesn't follow the series?
Because I honestly have never watched an episode.
It has nothing to do with the TV show.
No, you don't have to read the comic book either.
It doesn't matter.
Alright, cool.
As long as you know the basic concept.
I mean, they pretty much explain everything for you anyway.
Because it takes place, I guess, at the start of the whole thing anyway.
And you're in someone else's shoes, so everything's getting explained to you as if you were brand new.
Okay, cool.
So you get the rules of the series and the comic.
It's really easy to jump into.
Yeah.
I don't read the comics, I just watch the show.
I don't even watch the show, and I was able to get into it.
I mean, it has an ambiguous opening, but a lot of TV shows and movies do.
The show, and I believe the comic, opens the same way.
I don't think, because like I said, I didn't read the comic, but I don't think anyone knows how the whole thing started.
Everybody gets kind of thrown into it, so they start it the same way.
Now obviously trying to be very careful not to spoil anything because we have like Actdeft in chat is like no spoilers please no we're not we're not going to spoil we're not assholes don't worry but I have heard a lot of people say like through the Twitters and so forth that The Walking Dead has one of the best endings in a video game ever.
Would you sign up?
Would you sign up?
I don't know about ever, but it was really good.
I mean, because you're so emotionally invested in the whole game, then when you get to the end, it just feels like all the other choices you made are all important.
And that's a really cool thing.
I find that fascinating in the wake of everything everybody complained about with Mass Effect 3 this year.
Because Mass Effect 3 was kind of the opposite of that, where everybody bitched about the ending.
Yeah.
Unless the first time you played through the ending was with the extended cut.
Well, okay, but I didn't have that.
And before that was in there and so forth, as much as I loved Mass Effect 3, the ending... And I still defend the ending to an extent.
I think people blow it way out of proportion.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I mean, it's hard to say because this was probably all in development long before Mass Effect 3 came out.
But maybe Telltale kind of saw the reaction to Mass Effect 3's ending and made sure, we're not going to do that.
Yeah, and it's in the details.
Because the actual ending you get, everybody gets the same ending.
There's not alternate endings to this game.
Everybody gets the same one, but it's in the details leading up to that final screen that everybody sees that's different.
And the final, like one of the last kind of confrontations in the game.
Very heavy on past choices all the way back to episode 1 and 2 and things like that.
Fascinating.
It's really cool.
I want to just blow through the whole series.
You'll get to that part and you'll be like, why did I do that?
Or why didn't I do this?
It's really cool.
They're really just details and it's story stuff, but I think that's what makes it so good because you're so invested in this that when that happens, but the actual literal ending is the same for everybody.
Whatever happens at the end is the end.
What else for your gaming week?
Oh, so for Christmas, my wife got me a PlayStation Move.
So I was playing a lot of games with that.
I immediately got Portal 2 in motion.
And what else did I get?
Oh, I got the little big Planet 2 motion pack.
We just got booted from chat because there's too many people connected, guys.
Oh yeah, I just got booted too.
Did you try to join chat, Alan?
Yeah.
That was a no-no.
Okay, so we had five people join chat.
So now none of us can be in.
Not so fast.
Oh, I will.
I'll be back in chat as soon as I get my phone up.
So we're going to try to get a plan B here in a minute.
Alan broke the rule.
He's yelling at me from the other room.
I didn't know the role.
I would have just not been in chat.
I didn't have to be in chat.
All right.
So we're going to try to get back in chat as soon as we can, guys.
It's going to be a little bit, though, so just bear with us.
But anyhow, let's just move forward.
So what else for your gaming week, Flaco?
Okay.
So, yeah.
So my wife gave me the PlayStation Move because I'm always bugging her oldest brother and her sister-in-law to borrow theirs.
But they're kids.
They play Just Dance.
I'm like...
But I want to use it because I want to play it.
I played Heavy Rain when I borrowed theirs.
And then I heard the Portal 2 in Motion Pack came out.
I'm like, I want that so bad.
So my wife just got me one.
So now I can play it.
I downloaded the Portal 2 in Motion.
That was really cool.
I only played like a couple levels.
I played the tutorial and some of the levels after that.
It was really fun.
LittleBigPlanet with Move is awesome.
The Move levels specifically are really good.
And I played some...
Gosh, what is it called?
Sly Cooper.
Those had just lame move minigames.
But yeah, I'm excited.
It works pretty well.
And I played the Epic Mickey 2 demo, which I didn't like because... Well, first I played it before I got a motion controller.
And I thought they were going to fix it where you didn't have to have motion control.
And they did, but you have to use the right analog stick to kind of aim where you paint stuff.
And so I hated that.
So when I got the move, I'm like, let me try it again with that.
And it was better with the move, but I still don't like the game.
And...
What else was in my gaming week?
Oh, and then I bought Journey, because I finished Walking Dead, and I'm like, I want to play one more Game of the Year candidate, and I want something short.
And I played the Journey demo when it came out.
Remember, don't stop believing.
Yes.
And I actually wasn't that impressed by the demo, but everyone kept saying, well, it's better when you get further into the game or whatever, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Parts of that remind me of Chrono Trigger when you're walking up the mountain and the wind blows and you have to hide behind the trees so you don't get blown off the mountain.
There's stuff in Journey that's like that.
I'm like, oh, that's so cool.
It doesn't blow you entirely off the mountain, but there's some really cool stuff in Journey.
It was reminding me of other games.
There's kind of a platforming level that's my favorite level in Journey where you just have to climb this tower and I love it.
and it was it was a lot better like I played a couple levels by myself because I think it's supposed to be online and there's people like there but I think whoever I was with was way ahead of me and it was really lame like I can't keep up with this guy uh but the second time I kind of started again at that because once you beat it you can start anywhere in the game
So I started at that level again, which is pretty close to the end, and I played it through the end again, and I had a partner the whole time, and I even got a trophy for playing the majority of the game with one person the whole time.
Oh, wow, nice.
Yeah, so it was me and this other person, and I think we were both kind of the same skill level.
Maybe it was their first time, I don't know, but it was kind of cool.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
I just want to just a quick note for the live listeners.
I did manage to get back into chat on my mobile because what I did is I did over 4G.
So I have a different IP now.
So I am in on mobile.
So I will be able to read chat comments.
Some people are still talking about Walking Dead in chat right now.
And let's see.
Phantasm chat says journey and a point and click adventure game of the years.
That's if you believe everything you read on the internet and seeing the TV shows and stuff.
Yeah, it seems like those are the two that are kind of taking a lot of their awards.
They were both awesome.
Yeah, Journey's great.
Yeah, I love Journey.
And like I said, I was a little skeptical because I played the demo and I wasn't super impressed.
I'm like, really?
I'm going to play this for, you know...
3 hours and love it, well I loved it it's a short little 3 hour game and I loved it so you can't always base your impressions of a game off the demo no, you can't, hopefully Bobby heard that I had to work that in there, come on anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
I think that's basically oh you know what, on my anniversary my wife got her hair done and while she was doing that I played Link to the Past on my phone and
I'm the last, I've played it before, but I haven't played it in a long time, and I'm in Ganon's final dungeon, so I'm excited to finish that again for the first time in a long time.
Okay, I have to ask this.
Do you get as pissed off as I do when you're fighting the worm thing, and it knocks you off the platform 57 million times in a row?
Yes, I hate that.
I hate any time, anything that knocks you off a platform.
The first time I ever played that guy, it took me two hours.
Oh my gosh.
Because I kept getting interrupted by my brothers, and every time, fall.
Luckily, I just had the knowledge of doing it before, so this time I was like, okay, I remember... It doesn't take that long anymore, but the first time... Yeah, yeah, yeah, the first time it was terrible.
So this time I was like, oh yeah, I can beat this guy down, because I know exactly what to do, and I know what spells or abilities to use for each boss, so it's kind of cool.
But that was it for my gaming week.
A little old school gaming thrown in there.
Alright, let me talk about my gaming week.
Some of the games we've already discussed a little bit.
I did finally get a chance to check out Walking Dead episode 1 at least.
Let me just say this, it was good enough where I downloaded episodes 2 through 5 right after.
I thought it was great.
I don't even watch the show.
I don't watch a lot of TV shows.
And, you know, again, I find there's a lot of people that are like, oh, I don't want to play the games because I don't want to spoil myself for the show.
So just to be clear, games based off comics, show based off books, right?
Or something else.
So...
Yeah, it's based off the comic book universe.
So it doesn't even spoil the comics because it's a completely different thing.
Yeah, so they go different directions.
And the characters, most of them are different and so forth.
So yeah, you got all that going on.
So just don't let that ruin it for you.
Some other games I played this week.
I played a couple of racing games, actually.
The game rental service sent me a couple of racing games.
And I checked out Need for Speed Most Wanted.
Dan's playing that.
Yeah, what do you think?
Well, he's using his driving rig.
The one he set up for GT5.
That's going to make any racing game better.
He's been pretty into it.
He likes it.
Yeah, it's interesting because this is a Criterion game, and the last big thing I know they did in the racing world was Burnout Paradise.
So it's like, somebody got burnout in my Need for Speed.
Now, you don't have the epic crashes and all that, but it is like the whole cop chase is back in there and so forth, but it's more like open world.
I like it.
It's fun.
I like the open world element of it and the places you can go and do the races and so forth.
But I gotta say, I played another racing game this week that's a little better.
So it's been taking my attention away from Need for Speed Most Wanted, and that is...
Sugar Rush.
No, I wish.
No, Forza Horizon.
I've been playing quite a bit of, and it's great.
At first, I thought I was going to hate it, because I started playing it, and I'm like, what the hell is this?
Like, Coachella Festival in the middle of Colorado, rich, spoiled white kids racing daddy's car and wrecking it.
Like, what the hell?
Hipster bands all over the place.
What the hell is this?
But actually...
It's... The way they put it together is pretty good.
I don't like that you can't customize the protagonist at all, but whatever.
That's really a minor bitch.
It's not really about that.
It's about the racing, and the racing element is really good.
I like the fact that they have it set up with a very flexible difficulty.
You can play this in, like, racing game for dummy mode, and it's great.
Having all the computer easy... You can have the thing, like, do the braking for you.
And there's guidelines and all this stuff.
Or...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and as much as I joke about the hipster soundtrack it actually is a pretty good soundtrack so I give props for that as well although my one minor minor bitch is that I hate that the game will not remember what radio station I've been listening to I don't want to switch to the other one but anyway that's a really minor bitch
Online support, pretty good.
Did some races with Actdeft and Bobby the other night, and we're all in the little VOG club on Forza Horizon, which, by the way, if you have the game, request membership to the VOG club, V-O-G, very easy to find.
And I'm an officer now, so I can promote people or whatever.
So if you want to join in and race with us, it's a good time.
I've been meaning to use my racing.
I have a Microsoft racing wheel with the pedals and everything, and I have not used it for anything.
I got it like a long time ago.
All I've done is paint it.
I need screen prints of that to put in my portfolio
as the use of the logo.
No, it's fine.
It's fine.
Talk to Bobby about it.
I don't know how to do that.
So there you go.
And Actdeft wants to clarify in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
Bobby and I, Actdeft, are leaders of the VOG Club in Forza, so you can ask any of us.
So yeah.
Well, I think you just ask for membership and whatever officer happens to see it will approve it.
So that's all.
But yeah, I...
even though the whole thing is like Colorado they're able to do some very varied environments like there's a little city there's some really beautiful like there's a cliffside race that was just like where you're going through tunnels and stuff that I was just like oh man this is beautiful look at so um and yeah I had a great time with online mode and I love the scaling difficulty it's it's a great racing game it's one of my favorite racing games I played in a very long time
This is probably the first game I've got from the rental service where I'm like, yeah, I want to keep this one.
I'm going to buy it.
I'm going to keep it.
So, yes, highly recommend Forza Horizon if you're into racing games.
Not like the other Forza games at all.
That's very important to say.
It's arcade more style.
And I say that's great.
I don't know if this is true.
I heard a lot of the people that used to be with Bazaar that made the old Forza games.
Right?
And then they made Blur was the game that shut down that office, unfortunately, which was a tragedy.
But anyway, I hear a lot of them were involved with this anyway.
But I don't know if that's true or not, but I believe it.
I would absolutely believe it.
So, yeah, it's great.
I'm loving it.
So...
Now that I've said a lot of good things about it, I do need to express one of my kind of complaints that's a big exclamation point, and it's not so much about the game itself, but it's more about the model, and...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Forza has a couple features in it that I think are a little bit shady for real money and some of that is that you can buy car credits that you can use to basically replace the in-game currency to buy the cars instantaneously.
You can buy a cheat map or whatever that shows you all the discount.
One little perk in the game is that as you break certain billboards you increase the level of your discount you get at the upgrade shop.
Well you can buy a map
for real money that shows you where all 100 of those discount billboards are.
So it kind of makes the game easier.
Or you can just go on GameFAQs or something like that and just do the same thing for free.
It's all those in-game cheats you can buy and so forth and what have you.
I understand the having different cars as DLC.
I understand the having the Horizon Rally as DLC.
But some of this other stuff, it's not that it ruins the game because you don't have to do it.
I just think it's a little bit tacky, especially when it's press right trigger to get it.
and then pops up the menu.
It's just like, quit shoving that shit in my face because it's really tacky to ask me to pay $60 for a game or whatever and then do this stuff on top of it.
Now again, I'm just saying, I did enjoy the game overall and I didn't pay $60 for it.
I rented it.
So maybe in some ways I did get it for free and I deserve to have all this shoved in my face.
But if I do decide to take the plunge and spend the $40, $50, $60 to get it,
I just wish the game would stop trying to nickel and dime me after that.
It's like, as a developer, I really think you need to choose which road are you going to go down?
Are you going to charge $60 for a fully featured game?
Are you going to charge $0.99 for a half-assed feature game and try to sell me the $50 worth of features?
That's my big question about it.
So, just saying.
That's my one little bitch about the thing.
Actdeft in chat says, Rob, it's people from Bazaar and Codemasters.
That makes a lot of sense, actually.
So there you go.
Alright, by the way, Jamie, I did also get in the car shop, the decal shop, somebody made a car made with N7 sticker on it.
It looks like the Normandy.
It's adorable.
Okay, I have to play this now.
Thought you might say that.
Alright, that's it for my gaming week.
I'll leave it at that.
I felt like I played a lot of games in my downtime and was able to play some well.
to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
Use the passphrase, group.
So now that we're like an hour into the show, maybe we should get into some news.
Let me throw out some housekeeping.
Fuck the news.
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to visit us on Twitter.
Also, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to add us on Facebook as well.
We are also on Google Plus at...
Google Plus, search Orange Lounge Radio.
There's also a little mini URL that Tiger Claude made some time back.
It's like gplus.to slash Orange Lounge Radio or something like that.
I don't know.
Anyway, let's get into some actual news.
Loki, why don't you start us off?
So there was a lot of drama with the game War Z. It was released on Steam and it wasn't very good because it wasn't finished yet.
And there was a bunch of stuff that they had in the product description talking about the features of the game and not a lot of that was true.
And then it got to the point where it was so bad that Valve actually kicked it off Steam until the publisher...
or I should say the developer fixes all the problems and issues with it.
So to kind of go along with that, now they're having the actual name of the game being suspended and the trademark is kind of gone because of the movie World War Z which is going to be coming out in 2013 with the zombie typhoon.
Really weird trailer for that.
but yeah so there of course you know the War Z is a little too close to the World War Z and unfortunately the War Z filed their trademark request a little after World War Z and so because of that it's most likely going to go to you know Paramount so now it's going to be called something else
I thought when I heard about that game that I was like, wasn't there that movie as well?
There's been a book out for years.
I kind of did think there was a link between them.
So I have to admit, oops, I might not be helping the game's case here, but I kind of did think they were related at first.
Before I read up a little more on the game, I finally did figure it out.
Yeah, and unfortunately the game in me looks kind of like a ripoff of The Daisy.
If I remember correctly, I think this is actually, it's another game that has a similar title, like War Something, and it's kind of like a zombie mode of that, or a zombie mod of that.
But...
Yeah, it kind of sucks.
Another MMO trying to compete in that same franchise.
Is this the same game that has all that fuckery behind it where the Steam thing was misleading and all that?
Yes, yes, that was it.
Where the guy called his own fans that were abusing the game or whatever a dirty word and all this stuff.
You know, claiming there's multiple maps, there's only one.
Claiming that the maps are like 1,500 kilometers or whatever and it's not even close.
I'm gonna holla back to a 2011 reference but it's like if that ocean marketing guy were running a game company like that's just what I have pictured in my mind of like this when I read about this guy and his antics with the game as I'm like oh my god it's like that ocean marketing crap all over yeah it's just it's not not boating well and unfortunately I don't think the game will be able to recover from it because by the time that
All this stuff is fixed and the final version of the game is done.
You probably have the standalone DayZ client, so no one really cares.
Some people cared because they bought the game, but unfortunately it's pretty terrible because they never said, oh hey, this is like an alpha that we're releasing as a paid game.
It's really weird.
I don't know.
PlayStation 2
No more.
It's done.
At least in Japan.
The PlayStation 2 has ceased shipping to Japanese retailers.
Once the current stock of PlayStation 2 is off the Japanese shelves, it is gone.
It's the PlayStation 2.
The console is literally about 13 years old.
It's probably one of the longest lasting consoles out of any of them.
It's had a good life.
But there's a lot of people this week that are like,
No more PS2.
But, I mean, come on, guys.
There's plenty of them out there.
Dreamcast.
I think the only reason this is actually sad is because not all the PlayStation 3s are backwards compatible.
So what if my PlayStation 2 breaks and I need to get a new PlayStation 2?
Thrift store.
I guess that's what you're going to have to do, right?
I don't know.
eBay.
And they don't say anything about the U.S.
either, but I don't think these are exactly easy to find in the U.S.
as it is.
Wings of a Goddess I don't know if that came out over here
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Because I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.
I was actually surprised they were still making PS2 games for a while after the PS3 came out.
I mean, yeah, I expected maybe a year.
But how long has the PS3 been out now?
What, two years?
Three years?
Something like that?
It's been more than that.
More than that, yeah.
Five years now, I think.
I'm so completely not surprised.
It's time for... I bet they're prepping for a next-gen system.
Of course.
And phasing out the... It's almost exactly how it happened with the first PlayStation.
Well, it...
Yeah, it's just there's no game sync coming out in PS2 anymore.
It doesn't matter.
The people who are gonna have one, have one.
Right.
I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2.
Works just fine.
Don't need a new one.
Going to our chatters who are clarifying some of the Final Fantasy XI issues, Shane Alinko says, they already said no more Final Fantasy XI PlayStation 2 expansions in the US.
Ragenator says Wings of the Goddess did come out here, but there won't be any more here in the US, which makes sense.
Who cares?
It's just Final Fantasy XI anyway, goddamn.
There's a lot of newer games you could be playing.
I don't even know, well, and the other thing too is I don't even know if that, couldn't they do it digitally?
I mean, I know they don't really have anything in sort of in place for PlayStation 2, but I mean, if you think about it, you could probably just download, because I know they have those three kind of micro expansions.
Those never really came out as a disc version, but they could do something like that.
Yeah, you can download it to the hard drive.
I don't know.
Damn, there's so many job classes I was not aware of.
I was like, well, dude, what's all this?
This is a scholar.
I don't know.
I'm a smart guy.
That's really going to fight off a goblin.
They're black mages and white mages.
They're like gray mages, but their thing is that they're a great sub job because you can do the... I forget what the skills call, but it's basically you enhance your black magic and weaken your white magic or vice versa.
They're like a yin-yang mage type of thing.
Yeah.
Cool.
And now you know.
And now I know.
And dancers are great for soloing.
Let's get to level 20 first because shit, I gotta go do all that stuff solo now because I'm not gonna be able to... I think I'm gonna go back to play Ragnarok online now.
Because retro's fun?
Hey, that's why I picked the Ragnarok server, so it'd be easy for me to remember which one it was.
It's like, yeah, Ragnarok, okay, cool.
Yeah, because Bismarck's gone, so I don't even know where the hell my character would be anyways, even if I redid my old barred Black Mage.
They merged a bunch of servers.
Flaco, you have fond memories of the PlayStation 2?
Yeah, and actually, my wife and I were thinking about buying a Slim a couple years ago, so we went to Fry's, and I had one, but, I mean, I have one, but it's kind of flaky, it doesn't have a great video connection, it doesn't play, sometimes it cuts out in the middle of playing a game, so it's dying.
And she wanted to play Kingdom Hearts 2, and so I was like, well, we're at Fry's, let's just see, what is it, like 20 bucks?
It's still $100, two years ago at least.
Oh, wow.
I'm not paying $100 for a PlayStation 2.
Or someone at the thrift store for $50.
It's honestly because these older devices, they don't price protect them, so they're not going to drop the price because they're losing money.
Because when they bought them, there was no margin in it anyway, so they're not going to eat $50 on a console.
They're just going to let it sit there until someone's dumb enough to buy it for that.
I mean, that's why you've got to go secondhand.
Yeah, I mean, I had a used one.
That was my whole point.
So we just hooked up the old one, and it worked.
My wife beat Kingdom Hearts 2 again, and all was good.
Well, I'm looking at Amazon, and they're a little scarce to find.
I mean, they're all from the second-hand sellers, and $149 new or $130 new, but $50 used, or $43.99 used.
Yeah, well, mine held up, so that was good.
But yeah, I had no idea it would be $100.
I was thinking maybe...
DarkSakura
Well, as I was saying earlier, there are Steam sales.
Yay!
And I mean, there's a crapload of sales.
There's daily sales, flash sales, prolonged discounts.
You can basically see a game go on sale every 12 hours.
I'm not really joking at all they're doing like bundle sales like 75% off whole game series and stuff and you can get Steam alerts and now it's like in fact I just had the Steam site open just a moment ago but they had hold on say something Rob I wanted to check in with everybody on their Steam casualties what have you given into on this sale so far I picked up Limbo
and Closure and I picked up what the crap game was that oh Assassin's Creed 2 like I was saying Skyrim isn't on a good enough sale yet for me to justify it the Bioshock franchise is on sale for 10 bucks check Skyrim again it was the daily today or yesterday and that's as low as it's gonna get the Bioshock franchise yeah I'm not gonna pay 30 bucks Bioshock franchise go Amazon it's five bucks there hmm
I'd still play it through.
Yeah, I hear Far Cry 3 you can get a better deal on some other websites too.
Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition is $2.49.
And seriously, if you haven't played that by now, then what rock have you been under?
Mass Effect 2 right now is $5.
I bought Gianna Sister's Twisted Dreams because I wanted it anyway.
The Valve Collection is $50.
That surprisingly is the only game I bought.
Except, I will say, Alan...
Trying to get the achievement for getting the gift meta thing or doing all the little meta achievements for the holiday sale.
He gave me a gift of a little $1.50.
I didn't know they had achievements for a sale.
They do.
Anything to get you to buy.
This is another game I'm actually kind of interested in.
It's another $2.50 game.
It's called The Tiny Bang Story.
One of the indie games.
It's got some neat puzzle elements in it too.
But back on the Critical Mass Postal Beat Hazard.
Let's see, I'm just trying to get... The entire Indie Super Mega Pack 30 games is $70.
Not bad.
Which for all of that, yeah.
I will probably inevitably get Dark Souls again when it goes on Super Sale.
The Far Cry franchise is $50.
Not bad.
Mark of the Ninja, $8.
The Witcher 2, $8.
Flacco, have you given in to any of the sales yet?
I have not, but I already have a lot of those games.
I have Limbo, and I love Bioshock.
I have those, and I got the Humble Bundle thing.
So I was like, I don't need more games that I'm not going to play because I still need to hook a computer up to my TV in the front room because I haven't had that since I moved.
Hey, and Civ V, $8. $8.
Get that, because Civ 5 is great.
I don't really like the Civ games, but other people can play them.
You know this about me.
Here's something if you want to get Civ 5 and some other games.
They have on Amazon.
See, because I've been doing Amazon because everything's Steam codes, and you can just redeem it over on Steam, and they're a little bit cheaper.
Shop around for the best bargain.
The 2K Mega Pack, which is I think seven or nine games, includes Bioshock 2, Bioshock, Borderlands Game of the Year Edition, Civ City, Rome, Duke Nukem Forever Complete Pack, Mafia 2, Civ 5, Game of the Year Edition, Civ 4, the Complete Edition, and the Stronghold Collection for $30.
I don't think I would even accept money to take Duke Nukem forever.
Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Loki, check your profile and see the badges.
That's for the holiday sale meta achievements and all that crap is.
or don't.
Don't get suckered into that stuff.
I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the little mini games this year where it's like the little achievements within the games that were tied to the holiday.
They haven't done things like that since last year and I like that stuff.
Remember last year they had the whole get the pieces of coal and then you could trade up the coal and get the games.
That was so much better but I guess beggars can't be choosers.
It's awesome they're doing what they are as it is.
Disney Infinity
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Um, yeah, it's very interesting.
I wish we had more information about it.
As if, like, you know, we had some sort of document or something that, oh, what the hell is this that's in my lap here from, like, weeks ago that's under a pile of cords and stuff?
It's a document about Disney Infinity.
That's so weird.
So weird.
Let's see here.
Mm-hmm.
Introducing a new game platform that takes you to infinite game possibilities and beyond.
Imagine bringing together your favorite Disney and Disney Pixar heroes' stories and locations as toys to create your own unique customized environments, adventures, and stories just the way you want them.
Now you can with Disney Infinity.
The possibilities are infinite.
But it sounds like the game itself may not be like, you know, we know it's inspired by Skylanders, the whole like real life figures and this whole thing.
But it's not that the game itself may not necessarily be Skylanders because Skylanders is apparently very Diablo.
Yeah, I think it is going to be kind of more like the toy box mode because they're talking about, OK, so some of the stuff that they're going to be tying in with is mainly going to be a lot of movie tie ins and stuff.
So, for example, since this game is supposed to be coming out around June.
You're going to have Monsters University, Pixar's Cars, The Lone Ranger, Incredibles,
Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gadgets, Buildings, Vehicles, Environments, etc.
Basically, the way they have it work is each character has a character, coins, and a playset pieces.
They get put down on this reader.
When you put them on the reader, it unlocks game content.
But they are actual figures.
They're actual figures.
The actual reader is actually kind of the same shape as the Infinity logo or the N that they have in the Infinity logo.
It's like this weird like hexagon.
It's this weird like uneven hexagon thing that they've got there.
At least that's in the little...
and yeah it's uh apparently yeah it says open world innovative game design AAA quality game uh complete line of interactive game pieces supporting all platforms supports all TWDC events um
So yeah, looks like it'll be interesting.
I mean, more interesting than Skylanders, that's for sure.
Whatever.
Because it's Disney and all the Disney works.
You know people are going to fucking eat this shit up.
And it's because...
I mean, look at just the crap that people collect.
I'm a little worried about Flacco.
Not only is he a Disney addict like the rest of us, but he has kids, and he can justify, oh, it's for the kids.
I know.
If my kids want Skylanders, I'll be like, no, but if you want something similar, you can get a Disney video.
I'll be fine with that.
So, yeah, I mean...
It'll be interesting.
But yeah.
Will you find an excuse to go to Disneyland just because they have a limited edition character that you can only get in the parks?
Probably.
Because you know that shit's going to happen.
I'll go anyway.
I don't care.
Well, anyways, you'll be hearing it from the rest of the game blogs in January because there's some sort of embargo or some bullshit.
But you know what?
No fucking embargoes on this train.
No one shares information with us.
All right.
Fair enough.
It's just Disney Infinity.
It's not Fort Knox.
We all know what's coming.
There it is.
All right.
Anyhow, let's go from Disney to talking about pornography, shall we?
Yay.
Well, that's an easy segue.
I'm suddenly reminded of this gif I saw of the Wicked Queen from Snow White.
She's holding this open box and she has this scowl on her face.
And the little caption says, who put a dick in this box?
That was awesome.
Yeah, that's great.
Anyway, let's talk about porn.
Porn found on a 3DS and was traded into GameStop.
Oh, boy.
Yes.
Let's see.
This is actually a report from the Daily Mail that got this.
I guess a refurbished Nintendo 3DS had nine pornographic images on it and was yet traded into GameStop.
Oh, wait.
Does this link to a local news story?
I gotta do this because it looks like it's Channel 9 News here in the States.
Oh, I gotta find this.
Yes!
We get to hear sensationalist local news.
I love sensationalist local news.
Let's hear sensationalist local news tell the story.
Who can take a small problem and just blow it way out of proportion?
Local news.
We need a bumper for local news that just distorts everything.
Alright, here we go.
Local news on Porn in 3S.
I don't want to hear... Zip ties!
I love zip ties!
Sell me more!
You're blowing zip ties out of a Porsche.
Dude, do they have like a shop that's dedicated to zip ties?
Because that's fucking awesome.
I want to know more now.
It's your zip ties.
Your long zip ties.
Your small zip ties.
Your colored zip ties.
You know what?
What the hell?
It's apparently... Spatula City.
It's a store called A to Z. And it has everything from... They sell spatulas.
Who needs that place to zip ties?
People who like work with a lot of cords and people who want to murder people?
I don't know.
All right, local news time.
Shut up.
New tonight, a father from Lakewood had to return one gift that was given his son.
He says it traumatized his family.
The five-year-old boy found pornographic pictures on the refurbished game device he got for Christmas.
9 News reporter Megan Fitzgerald joins us from the GameStop where the item was purchased.
Megan, the company says it's trying to make it right.
Adele, that's what they're saying, but the dad just doesn't... Wait, the reporter, the lady's name is Adele?
Did I hear that correctly?
Is the news lady's name Adele?
You know people are named Adele, by the way.
Let's go outside the GameStop and watch the sky fall.
See how that's possible since you can't just erase these images from his son's brain.
But the store behind me gave the family a brand new upgraded Nintendo 3DS.
They also threw in some games in there.
But the dad says there's really no way to make this right.
He just wants to let other families know so it doesn't happen to their kids.
That's the name of the electric buzzsaw, by the way, trying to get into the kid's brain.
No kidding, it's a toy tank.
It's really exhilarating.
Or it is really exhilarating.
Especially when you're five, and especially when you've been waiting all year round for that special toy.
I got a 3DS.
Yeah, you got a 3DS, that's right.
And these are the pictures that we took this morning.
There's Brayden.
But Wednesday morning, that excitement turned to horror.
He handed a 3DS to Brighton, and Brighton said, Dad, I don't think he should be looking at these pictures.
Wait, stop.
I don't think we should be looking at these pictures.
It's just a DS.
It's not a 3DS.
It's just exactly like a DS.
You are 5.
You shouldn't be looking at those pictures because don't you read the warning that you're not supposed to play it when you're under 7 or you're going to go cross-eyed?
That's true.
Did you hear about that?
And I said, Dad, this DS has porn on it.
and I handed him the DS and he just got up and walked out.
Are they all crying?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
First world problems, first world problems.
Dad is wiping away tears.
Hold on.
And the kid is crying.
How does a kid know what porn is?
How does a five-year-old know what porn is?
That's the first thing he said was, this has porn on it?
Julian doesn't know what porn is.
Because I would think that a five-year-old isn't probably going to know what that stuff is.
Oh, those people are being silly.
I'm going to ask an expert, a.k.a.
a mom.
Does your son know what porn is?
This whole thing really... Allegedly, in my opinion, this thing seems like it's being set up for a lawsuit.
Look good on camera, guys.
Make sure you're crying.
And they told the kid what to say.
There's porn on the DS, daddy.
I'm asking Becky.
Even Fifth Dream in chat, why does a five-year-old know what porn means?
To the phone.
Oh, I lost it.
I just called everybody.
Really?
It was hard for Mark Giles' two young sons to see pornographic images on their toy.
Now look, I get if somebody is like super religious or whatever and is offended by the side of porn and so forth.
And the fact that like a kid saw it because, you know, as much as we're laughing to have a good time with it, it is fucked up that a kid, you know, that didn't want to be subjected to it got subjected to it.
But I'm sorry.
This is way over the top for me.
But you know what?
This is not angry.
You know what's even worse about it?
I hate the spoiled part of the story here that we're probably going to get to here.
I think he said it was from Santa Claus.
Hmm.
That was a gift from Santa Claus.
There was another one.
I can't be mature about it.
I can't be mature about that.
There was another one that I saw, too, that wasn't necessarily this, but it was one of those where you buy stuff from Walmart as a returned item, and in the box, instead of a 3DS, it was rocks.
That's great.
Okay, so I asked Becky, for the sake of the show, does Julian know what porn is?
And I did, at the end.
And she says, no!
In big, bold letters, with four exclamation points, and then LOL.
But it was even harder for him.
And then I said, you know, what was going on, and she said, weird!
So that's coming from a mom with a five-year-old, just saying.
All right, let me let the sensationalist local news, courtesy of Nine News, finish up here.
Who tried so hard to make Christmas special.
About nine images of sexual activity on his toy that he got from Santa, that Santa got from GameStop.
So GameStop tried to make it right.
They told Giles the images were from a previous owner and they weren't caught before the refurbished device was sold.
But you can't unsee this.
He's five years old.
Now maybe when he's 18 or 20, maybe he won't know anything about it.
The kids are hugging right now.
They're showing a picture of the kids hugging.
The little boy has no freaking clue what's going on.
They're comforting each other about this horrific imagery.
He's not going to forget about it tomorrow.
And the company wouldn't go on camera, but the corporate office sent us the following statement.
It says, GameStop is currently researching the situation.
We have a rigorous quality control process in place to ensure that existing content is removed from all devices before they are resold.
Out of millions of transactions each year, ones like this happen very rarely.
Our number one priority is to make this right for our customers.
Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says, ROFL, Santa shops at the Evil G.
and an employee at the GameStop behind us told Giles that they're going to do their own investigation to try and find out how this happened, Adele, so that they can make sure it doesn't happen again.
Really?
Really?
I'm kind of curious, Megan, is this type of a bulk eraser?
It would seem like that you would erase everything on every unit.
You would think so, Adele.
In fact, the father was saying that there's a SIM card that easily could have just been removed that would have erased all of these images, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
Of course, we weren't going to show those images because they were very graphic.
But again, the company is saying that they try and catch things like this, but this one obviously slipped through the cracks.
Obviously.
All right.
Megan Fitzgerald.
Thanks, Megan.
Slipped through the cracks.
Really?
Really?
They're going to launch an investigation to like, oh, some dickhead forgot to erase this.
Yeah, but the thing is with the way that GameStop functions, probably half that store is fired.
No, seriously.
No, you're right, probably.
Because they make up shit to fire their employees over.
I'm not lying.
I don't think that the store would get fired because any system that they take back for refurbishment gets sent away.
No, this is GameStop.
There's a reason why they're called Evil G, Loki.
They fire people for the tiniest of little reasons.
I know people personally.
Why do you think my husband quit?
Actdeft in our chatroom says, they could have had the porn, but they're rolling in the deep.
All right, forget it.
Look, it is a crappy situation.
I think that is way over the top, the way everybody's reacting.
It's like, okay, you know, it's obvious what happened.
It is wrong.
GameStop should say, hey, whoops, we didn't erase this one, you know.
But at the same time, I kind of wonder, like,
How did... Did the parents not think to look first before handing the system to their five-year-old?
I mean, he says, I went to go take the picture and I handed it to the five-year-old.
How did... I'm trying to think, like, in having used the DS, how did he not see the pictures first then?
That's what I don't get.
You're the parent in the room.
My kid would not know what porn is when he's five.
And I don't think you even know what he was looking at.
Daddy, what's that?
Why are they naked?
Yeah, exactly.
I think that's what happened.
That's what I think might have happened.
And then he decided, oh, I'm going to get a case going.
So this is what you say to the reporter's kids.
Because I feel like the kid's not going to know what he saw.
In your opinion.
In my opinion.
In my opinion.
This is what I think.
I honestly think that it's parents thinking other people are doing their due diligence for them, honestly.
They say, oh, it's coming in.
We believe that, you know, we're not going to check.
We wouldn't think about this.
You know, if it was something that they were truly worried about, then they would have gone through it to begin with.
Let's be honest, as a 3DS cameraman, he's lucky to even know what's going on there because that camera is such a piece of shit.
He'll be like, what is that?
I don't even know what's going on.
Those two blobs are really close to each other.
I mean, it's just, who knows?
I just remember hearing from my little brothers, Mommy and Daddy are wrestling again.
Or even better, if they did shoot it very well, it's like, oh my god, my eyes are literally being raped by the penis coming out at me.
Dick in 3D.
TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, GameStop needs to double check their stuff.
I don't think any of us are doubting that, but you know, and I'm not exactly giving them a break, but it's like, I see how this happened.
Christmas rush, someone got lazy, it slipped through.
Doesn't make it right, but that's what happened, clearly.
or sometimes if you use a mass formatter for a card.
I've seen it happen where even for camera and phone sims, they won't do.
What about the guy that returned that in the first place?
Honestly, if it was me returning something, I wouldn't be like, hey, I'm going to put all my porn on there and leave it on there.
It's just like when I sold my 3DS on eBay, I erased all the porn that I had on there.
Not anything that I actually photographed, but you can download stuff that actually goes on your card that has picture sets and stuff like that.
People shot with professional 3D cameras that aren't shit like the 3DS cameras.
I think this is a good point that ShadowNextGen says in our chat room.
Walmart does a worse job than GameStop.
Actdeft closing up the story saying that kid should feel privileged he had 3D porn
I do all the time.
He's observing the future.
Speaking of Nintendo porn, a good segue for me to mention this.
A porn app coming to the Wii U, SugarDVD.
They offer unlimited adult TV streaming on the PlayStation 3, iPad, Xbox 360, and so forth.
They've announced that they're bringing their app to the Wii U. Unlimited streaming porn straight to the game console, $7.95 a month.
And you're probably thinking, wait a minute, how do they do this?
I don't know this porn app on the PS3 and so forth.
It's launched through the web browser.
So in other words, that's not much of an app.
It's a website that you pay for to just get it formatted.
It's like OLRPSP.com.
But it's cool to call things an app.
To be fair, it's probably looking at the user agent and stuff like that and formatting to their site.
Because I actually have the SugarDVD app on.
Of course you do.
No, no, no, no.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Let me be clear, let me be clear, I don't pay for porn, okay, so, okay, so, I had the app on, it came, you know, it's part of the repository for the boxy, and so they have it, you know, and of course I downloaded all the porn apps and seen, you know, I was like, ah, got
Pay for this, fuck that, delete.
But, you know, they had it.
And so, yeah, a lot of this thing with the boxy, the way the boxy works is it's just, you know, websites formatted for those devices.
So, yeah, I mean, I could see that they would do that.
And, of course, Nintendo would be like, oh, we don't officially do this.
By the way, the Internet Explorer browser on the 360 sucks for viewing porn.
Just saying.
We have to work on New Year's Eve?
That sucks.
Yeah, but my boss won't be there.
Oh, that's money.
Yeah, money.
That's the thing.
Money.
So anyway, we've been talking and talking about this and I knew it was going to happen and I'm so happy.
Steam for Linux Beta is out.
Yes.
And I happen to be running Linux.
I'm going to test it out.
Um, basically all you have to do is, um, if you don't already have a Steam account, you can install and register and you're in.
So anyone can be there.
There's 39 games on there right now.
Um, Killing Floor, um, The Book of Unwritten Tales, and Amnesia are there.
And I'm actually trying to see if I can get into the site there to see what else is on.
But I mean, still, you know, it's a start.
I think that's actually really cool.
And I like Linux.
I may not have to keep using a PC anymore.
So yeah, if you're interested in it, just play.
And you know what's great is that Steam big picture thing.
It really does kind of just make it look like an Xbox.
You know what else is great?
3D dick.
How could you talk about that, DarkSakura?
I'm traumatized.
Rob.
I'm gonna sue you.
Boobs!
I could say the C-bomb.
Did you notice also when he said when they found out, I called everybody I could think of.
Yeah, the news, your lawyer, GameStop.
But I did make sure to transfer the pictures before we gave it back.
Stop.
All right.
Let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a GameStop near you.
Boobies 3D.
Not a damn thing.
Nothing in the U.S.
this week?
Nothing in the U.S.
Nothing for people to spend their gift certificates on, huh?
Steam sale.
Steam!
The savior of gamers.
That's all you get this week.
Nothing new.
It's just all Steam stuff until the 8th.
Going to Japan and checking out the releases there.
Xbox 360, nothing.
PlayStation 3, nothing.
PlayStation Vita, nothing.
The games don't start really coming in again until January 17th, it looks like, actually.
Looking at the Wii U, nothing.
God, it doesn't look like there's hardly anything coming out on Wii U ever.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, it looks like it is totally dry in Japan as well, so enjoy the games you have right now.
I do notice, though, there is on PlayStation 2, Neopets, The Darkest Fairy.
Oh, that's a Europe game.
It's a Europe game that snuck my way into the Japanese releases.
All right, how about Europe, DarkSakura?
Nothing until the 11th.
But one of them's a Wii U game, Rob.
What's that?
Ninja Gaiden 3?
Okay.
Ninja Gaiden 3.
Why did I even say it wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I was thinking of porn.
3D Cop.
We were at Target just a couple days before Christmas and they had like 12 Wii U's there.
That's just the one up in Yuba City.
They have a tower of them at Fry's.
Yeah.
They're everywhere.
And yeah, they don't ship any to us.
It's everywhere.
$1,200 on back order with Nintendo.
They ship us 12.
Fuck them.
You know what would have sold them?
Tokyo Jungle.
I still need to play that.
Loki and myself have some stories, and we're going to go to the Classic Game of the Week.
Loki?
Let's see here.
This is kind of interesting.
There was that documentary about Minecraft called The Story of Mojang, and it is a two-player production.
They decided to go ahead and beat the rush and upload it to the Pirate Bay themselves.
So they uploaded it to the Pirate Bay.
People can download it for free.
They kind of said, hey, listen, we wanted to come here first because we knew the movie would eventually end up here.
And the best thing to do seems to be opening a dialogue.
Torns and piracy are a way of life and it probably won't be going away anytime soon.
You know, I did play Minecraft.
Fantastic.
You know, ironically enough, I did not play Minecraft this week.
Really?
Well, actually, I think I went in for a little bit because last week I was fixing the servers because I had screwed up the permissions by not installing the permissions client, so I kept changing the config file and was wondering, why the fuck is nothing changing?
Oh, I forgot to reinstall it.
That's funny.
So I was trying to do that install Flans mod, but Flans mod may not be coming.
I really wanted it to happen because that's planes, cars, and guns.
So I can shoot one of those scary gray guys with the bow and arrow in the face?
Yeah, you could do that now.
But I'm talking about actual guns like AK-47s.
I'm just hitting it with a pickaxe.
My little girl, because I found a skin for her, is making herself a prairie dog town to live in.
I'm surprised you didn't find like a shepherd model for your Minecraft character.
I'm going to make one.
I'm Zongief.
Mine's just like some whatever girl one is, but I'm making a shepherd for mine.
I did manage to update, well, I have, I'm doing the VOG-Minecraft.com actually has, it has a WordPress thing installed on it.
I haven't bothered to update it yet.
I haven't, like, started in so many projects.
I have another project that may be 2013 that I'm not really going to talk about right now, but hopefully it'll be interesting.
But the website is another thing I want to update, so eventually I'll get around to that, but, yeah.
Let me go back to the story about leaking your own damn film onto the Pirate Bay.
Let me ask our film guy.
Obviously, piracy is a bit of a problem in Hollywood, right?
Yes.
Especially when you talk about other countries, if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah, it's much bigger over there.
You can go to another country and just get any movie you want, really.
You can probably go to the theater and see a movie that was pirated.
Probably.
What do you think about uploading your own movie to the Pirate Bay?
I don't think it's a bad idea for a movie like this because what other exposure are they going to get?
Maybe a lot of documentaries sign Netflix deals and I don't know how that works.
I don't know how the money transaction works.
But if these guys put it up on the Pirate Bay and they put, like Loki said, a message on there saying, hey, please give us money, people might donate to that.
The Guilt Thing
He uploaded it to the Pirate Bay and basically said, okay, we're going to do this.
You pay me what you want for it.
I think it's worth $5, but you tell me what you think it's worth and you pay me that or nothing.
From what I remember, I think he made actually quite a bit of money from that.
It turned out very well.
And I think that's kind of the way.
It seems like a lot of these pay-what-you-want things like the Humble Bundles and stuff do really well.
And they get probably a lot more money than they would have if they tried to sell everything individually.
Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, It's not guilt.
It's supporting something you like.
Fair enough.
And I haven't watched it yet, but the trailer looked really good for it.
I mean, it looked like a pretty awesome documentary.
I still need to watch the indie game movie from the Humble Bundle that I have.
I wanted to watch that anyway.
So...
All right.
Well, let me get one more story here for you guys, and we'll get to the classic game of the week.
But you know the Wii U game Tank, Tank, Tank, which actually is based on an arcade game?
Which is funny that you're so excited about it because the game's been getting shit reviews left and right.
Like, people do not like it.
I don't care about the Wii U one.
I care about the arcade one, which is awesome.
TankTankTank is now...
Free to play, in a way.
It's kind of a different type of model.
You download the upgradeable demo in the Japanese Nintendo eShop.
So what you can do if you're in Japan, you download this demo, you get the basic action game for free, it has multiplayer, you can do the city map, free for all, team battle, giant monster.
But if you download the free version, you can only play it three times a day.
That restriction is removed if you purchase any download content for the game.
If you want to get more parts of this upgradeable demo, you have to get these offered download contents in the game.
This is very iPhone, the way this is working out here.
All it is, the whole playing it three times daily, that's your little three energy pills.
And if you want more energy pills, go buy them on the store or whatever.
This is literally the iPhone pricing model.
on a launch title for the game now in the Nintendo Wii U shop.
Very interesting.
I'm a little cautious with Namco doing it because remember Ridge Racer on the Vita and how wonderful that was?
Well, you kind of hope that maybe they learned something from that whole experience?
I certainly hope so because, God, that was a fucking mess.
and Tank Tank Tank's pretty awesome but yeah looking at I can see why the reviews haven't been that good on it because it seemed like the game was very limited as what they what they're offering because I mean in an arcade game it would be it makes sense that okay you get like maybe an hour of entertainment out of it if you're really playing a lot of money into it but you know this is a console game so you gotta have a lot more to it otherwise you're gonna get really bored um so I don't know it's
Which reminds me, I need to really go back and play that Sega gun game.
What was that called?
I don't ever know.
Sega gun game?
Yeah, there was a Sega gun game that I was really raving about a while back.
It's an old... It's not Super World.
It's not one of the virtual games.
It's...
I can't fucking remember now.
It's just a really wacky game.
Alright, well, maybe somebody in chat will read your mind.
But I think this makes a very interesting sort of compliment to the last story you talked about.
I mean, they may not be putting Tank Tank Tank up on the Pirate Bay, but essentially they're putting it on a place where they're saying, hey, download it for free and let's see what happens.
Because I bet you a lot more people now will play Tank Tank Tank.
Ghost Squad Ghost Squad
Yeah.
Because now it's free.
And so everybody's going to be checking out.
And there's going to be maybe a handful of people like, oh, yeah, this is kind of fun.
And I probably wouldn't have bought this.
But you know what?
Even though the three times... I understand why they're limiting the gameplay because they're giving you quite a bit of the game.
And that seems kind of lame even though it is a demo and stuff.
But I understand why they're doing that.
But at the same time, it's kind of cool that they're offering that so a lot more people can actually check out the game.
Yeah.
Fifth Dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says these days wait three months to buy a game and you can spend the same amount to get the add-ons.
They're like $60 worth of costumes in DOA 5.
Worth.
That's how much they cost.
So not worth that.
I did that for Puzzle Bobble on iPhone.
Just saying.
And also the three times a day is way better than when they limit it to like 30 plays done.
You know, that type of thing.
Rayman Legends.
Heaven forbid if they did that to the Ni No Kuni demo.
I mean, Flacco would have worn it out by now.
I think I already have worn it out.
Alright, so there you go.
Tank, tank, tank.
Going free to play in Japan.
Who knows?
Keep an eye on the news.
That could happen here.
Especially if they have success with it in Japan.
We'll see.
Alright, let's travel back to a time when, you know what?
There was no free to play.
You paid the 50, 60 bucks for this game and either you liked it or F you.
It's the classic game of the week.
Yay, I'm in chat.
Oh, did the G-line get lifted?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, it's been an hour.
We should be able to safely reconnect to chat.
There you go.
Hooray.
Alright.
Someone tell Alan.
No, we can't all five do it.
No, I mean tell Matt to.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So.
Should I not get that going?
That's alright, I'll just be on my phone.
My phone's fine.
The classic name of the week is Gyruss.
Gyruss.
You mean, I have a YouTube of it.
I know, but I always have to
It's so freaking cool.
Let's have to listen to a little bit of it.
It's freaking awesome.
I love this game.
How many video games do you know play Takata and you can beat Minor Robin?
One.
Exactly!
So, Gyruss is a shoot-em-up game that if you've played Tempest, you may find the gameplay style very familiar because you go in a circle.
It was the last game that Yoshiki Okamoto did for Konami, the first one being Time Pilot.
And he was fired after the game was released, and he went to join Capcom, where he gave us, oh, just a couple of little obscure titles like 1942 and Street Fighter.
So this one, basically, you're moving around in a circle, hence, I guess, gyrus, and shooting things as they come from the background to the foreground.
Like I said, I'm again comparing it to Tempest, because I think that Tempest was definitely inspired by that.
So, um, and also like I said, that it actually does play an arrangement of Takata and Fugue in D minor, which I'm sure the Vanessa May fans in chat recognize that one from her version of it, if not, you know, actually paying attention to classical music, you know?
So, um, it was, uh, actually using stereo sound, and, um, in the bonus material that's for the Konami Arcade Classic, they said that they used it by, um, using different, um, audio circuits.
The game was, uh, used a multi-core processor that had two Z80 microprocessors, a 60 to 9 microprocessor, and an 8039 microprocessor.
For the sound, it used an AY38910 PSG sound chip and a DAC.
for those who are into the technical side of it.
So, again, it's a cylinder, you shoot stuff when they come at you, you've got, you know, swirly things that come at you if you don't get the enemies in time.
The enemies that you have are satellites, asteroids, and laser beam generators, and they just show up and some of them disappear if you don't shoot them first.
So, for other things you have with the asteroids, they actually fly out from the center relatively regularly, and you still have to shoot them.
Then you actually get a, you have to make it to different planets as you're going through the different stages.
So you'll, like at first it says two warps to Neptune, so you have to go through a warp, and each warp is your stage.
And then after you land on the planet, you get a bonus round.
Where you have to shoot different ships for bonus points.
Kind of like Galaga or Galaxian.
And you basically go through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and finally Earth.
Where you've got three warps to get to each planet.
Stage one and every tenth stage afterwards, the enemies will not fire on you when you enter the screen.
Guess what the video just said?
What?
One warp to Uranus.
Whatever.
So as far as its arcade release, it had an upright and cocktail cabinets.
Cocktail machines are the best, I swear.
It saved the high scores in RAM, but there was a mod kit that was released on August 22nd, 2003, that would save the top five scores after the machine was powered off, so you could actually save the score on the machine.
That would be a great name for a video game blog.
Three warps to Uranus.
I'm sorry.
Patent pending.
Jairus was... If we ever go our separate ways and have to make new podcasts, my next podcast is going to be called Three Warps to Your Anus.
Jairus was ported to different early systems.
There was a version on Atari 2600, 5200, which I think I've got that one, the Atari 8-bit, the Commodore 64, Rob, and the ColecoVision.
Can we hear the awesome Commodore 64 SID chip version of Takata?
I guess as long as we can go back to the old one.
Yes, we can go back to the old one.
We can do the remix.
Wait, oh, that wasn't the full thing.
Hold on, look at that.
Oh man, the Commodore 64 version of this is so good.
Why is the light flickering?
Is that concerning any of y'all?
It's just that the light bulb's going out.
This is the version I play, like non-stop.
I love this game.
Okay, sorry.
Play the remix.
Remember that showed up in Beatmania?
I can do that.
I was going to do that during the break.
Okay, we'll just do it in the break.
That means everyone has to stay listening through the break.
Okay, there was a NES port version that was basically a very faithful arcade reproduction.
It actually had some changes, but the really faithful version came out was the Konami Arcade Classics for PlayStation and the Konami Collector Series Arcade Advance for Game Boy Advance.
There are different bootleg versions.
There's one called Venus.
There is one called Inu that was done by Italian hackers, which I guess it had more scooters, more Vespas, and people going chow.
Eddie is our reference.
They are working on trying to restore versions on MAME.
So there's actually... And this is what pisses me off about how awesome everything came out on the Famicom Disk system.
Gyruss was one of the games that was a Famicom Disk.
And it had a neat looking logo.
It had the Konami logo over the top and...
It had Spaceship and Earth and everything.
And then Ultra Games brought out a version that was kind of butt.
I didn't think it was butt.
I thought it was pretty good for an NES.
I'm talking about Logo Rob.
Oh, yeah.
What happened though with it is it updated the graphics.
The music from the arcade version was slightly remixed.
There were additional tracks.
You start off with three warps to Neptune instead of two warps.
You get a super phaser attack with the normal gun.
You have extra enemies, boss fights, bonus stages, an ending to the game.
and in the NES version it says something about the universe being at peace.
In the Famicom Disk System you get a full ending sequence.
How's that?
You've got 39 looping stages instead of the 24 and on the NES version you actually play through the entire solar system including the Sun and Pluto.
The Konami code will work for Extra Lives however you have to enter it in reverse.
So A, B, A, B, right, left, right, left, down, down, up, up instead of the
You know what happens to the trivia?
If you do the regular Konami code in Parodius, it kills you.
Yeah, I was gonna say, I think it does that in Gyro.
If you do it reverse, then you do it Gyro style.
I think it does that in, um, um, Gradius IV, I think.
Yeah.
That version of the game is also included in the Majesco TV game Konami Collector Series.
Not the Game Boy Advance ones.
As far as other modern versions come out, like I said, there were the Game Boy Advance version, the PlayStation one.
You can get it on Xbox Live Arcade.
It's a TigerCon chat.
It says they should remake Gyruss, like same gameplay style but HD graphics.
I'm like, it's on Xbox Live Arcade.
You might have missed it.
So is, for anyone who's interested in other games that I've covered, R-Type is available that way, and it's really fun.
Also, there's a clone of the game that exists as a minigame in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
And like we mentioned earlier, Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2, there is a Gyrus remix, and it's also available in Game Room for Xbox 360 and Windows-based PCs.
So, there you go.
Jairus.
There it is, folks.
By the person who gave us Street Fighter.
I do have like a short Konami side story based on that.
Uh-oh.
Please, go ahead.
Oh, it was just, we have our little weekly meetings and they talk about upcoming games that we're going to come in to test and one of them was Time Pirate.
Time Pirate Time Pirate
But it's the same guy.
As soon as you mentioned that, I was like, oh, that totally reminds me of that story where we all were stupid for a week.
I always keep forgetting that it's the same person did 1942 in Street Fighter.
So, I mean, that's sort of the big tie-in.
A whole series of classic games right there.
I like finding the awesome people that installed so much of my childhood.
Yeah, that is pretty cool.
I spent a lot of time on a gyrus when I was...
Much younger and not paying for school.
Paid with my sanity, maybe.
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Gyruss Don't go anywhere guys, we've got more of Orange Launch Radio to come Part B is going to be a little different this week, we're going to do rapid fire news And then we're going to not do any more news after that, we're going to do some discussions We're going to do top game of the week, disappointing game, I'm sorry, top game of the week Top game of 2012, disappointing game of 2012, Fugo question of the week, mailbag, lots of stuff coming up after the break And, no 3D cock
Well, we don't want to traumatize any of the younger listeners, even though this is not a show for kids.
Turn off the radio if the five-year-olds are listening.
Also tonight, listless, last listless of the year with our 2013 predictions in gaming.
Oh, boy.
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our last show of the year, episode 487 for this December the 30th of 2012.
And we're going to get into some of our favorite games of the year and things we weren't so thrilled with this year, as is customary to do on a year-end special.
It's our totally cliche year-end special coming up a little later.
But first, we're going to travel around and get some rapid-fire news, the last news of the year that we're going to talk about.
Loki.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm trying to remain optimistic about it.
Multiplayer worked out very well for Mass Effect 3.
I saw Assassin's Creed 3's multiplayer over the Christmas holiday when we were watching somebody else play it.
It looked interesting.
I was like, that looks kind of fun to play.
Multiplayer is not all bad.
Yeah.
Of course, there's the Humble Indie Bundle 7 that was out.
Now, of course, like they do with most of the Humble Indie Bundles, they add stuff to it.
So now, if you pay over the average, you get Dungeon Defenders, plus the DLC Legends of Grimrock, the Basement Collection, Offspring Fling, and Cave Story Plus, which is not bad.
And yeah, I had to pick it up.
Cave Story is awesome.
Yeah, but it was also in a prior Humble Bundle.
That's alright, that's alright.
This is Cave Story Plus.
It was Cave Story Plus.
Was it?
Yes, it was.
Which one was it then that had that?
Two years ago, I think.
Yes, it was.
It wasn't six, it was four or five had it.
Really?
Yep.
because I've bought all of them since like... You better check your Steam library again.
You probably have Cave Story.
You just forgot.
Problem of Steam sales.
I forgot I own the Steam.
Seriously.
I just bought another copy.
Humble Bundle 4
I'm swimming in copies of Metro 2033.
It's like I have like four of them.
It's ridiculous.
But anyways.
So yeah, Humble Bundle.
It's awesome.
You should definitely pick it up.
They've got the indie game, the movie in there, Shank and all that fun stuff.
And Cave Third Plus if you haven't played it.
Like I haven't played it yet.
There's going to be a lot of indie game playing in 2013.
I won't tell you that much.
That one also came with Super Meat Boy Shank and Bitcher Brunner.
Be quiet, be quiet.
from, what can I assume, probably like a GameStop or something like that.
It's called Call of Duty Black Ops 2 Revolution.
It's going to include five maps, one of which is a zombie map.
They have Hydro, looks like a dam, Downhill, which is a ski resort, Grind, which I can't really see in this picture at all.
They had a better picture when it was on here.
Let's see.
Oh, here we go.
Okay, so...
Grind, which appears to be like a skate park or something, which is kind of cool.
Mirage, which looks like maybe like an Asian environment.
They got a lot of pagodas in the background.
And Die Rise, which is a zombie map on a high rise.
Plus they also give you this bonus Peacekeeper submachine gun.
apparently coming out on the 29th of January and it's supposed to be exclusive I think for the Xbox 360 for a while which makes sense they've been doing that in the last few Call of Duty games I'm kind of excited about it I'm looking forward to some new maps because we're kind of we played out the ones on Black Ops although I'm also looking forward to the rest of my co-workers fucking getting that game so I can play with more than just one other person because it's kind of annoying we're all on Modern Warfare 3 and
Yeah, I had to kick their ass on Friday, so I won the year.
So yeah, that's it.
Alright, well I have a few new stories for you too, and one of them is another retro collection coming to iOS and iPads and iPhones and all that good stuff, and very interesting, it's an Infocom collection.
You may not remember that name, but they did all the classic text adventure games back in the day, like Zork, Zork 2, Zork 3, I believe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was one of their games too.
It's not in this bundle though, I thought it was.
Yeah, Enchanters in there, Infidel, I remember that one, Planetfall, Witness, Wishbringer So anyhow, we're spouting off all these names of games that are in the Infocom bundle 27 classic adventure games, but it is $10 Like a lot of these collections, you can get the Core app for free The free one will come with Zork 1, so you get that for free You can be eaten by a Gru to your heart's content
After that, you can get five packs of games for three bucks a piece, or you just get everything for ten bucks.
You can also, for I think a dollar, buy these things called Invisi Clues.
They're the hint booklets for the games.
I have not checked out this collection myself, but I'm told that they have like compasses and some additional features that you didn't have back when it was just text on an Apple IIe or a Commodore system, you know, when they didn't have anything besides that, but...
It's fun for like five minutes, and then you realize, boy, games got a lot better.
Nintendo Power's last issue ranked the top 285 Nintendo games of all time.
285, and you might ask, why such a weird number?
Well, that's because there were 285 issues made of Nintendo Power.
So that goes all the way from 285 Super Star Wars on the Super Nintendo,
All the way to number one.
What does Nintendo Power believe was the best Nintendo game ever made?
Thoughts?
Don't look.
Regular Nintendo or Super Nintendo?
Any Nintendo platform, but it had to be on a Nintendo platform.
Best game ever made on a Nintendo platform.
Super Mario Brothers.
That was number... The original Mario Brothers was number 16.
Link to the Past.
Link to the Past was number two.
Super Mario World.
If that was number two, then I'm going to say Ocarina of Time.
Oh, I was gonna say that.
The number one overrated game.
There should have been one.
7, Mario 3 6, Mega Man 2 5, Mario World 4, Final Fantasy 3 or 6 3, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Zelda A Link to the Past 1, Zelda Ocarina of Time Zelda Arena of Time Where's Mario Kart?
11 is Skyward Sword 12 is the original Legend of Zelda If you look at the top 16
They are all Mario and Zelda games, with the exception of 8 Super Metroid, 6 Mega Man 2, 4 Final Fantasy 3, and get this, at number 13, this surprised me, Elite Beat Agents.
Where's Secret of Mana?
Secret of Mana?
Good question.
Earthbound.
Secret of 88.
Fuck them.
Fuck them.
Earthbound Earthworm Jim Earthbound 156
Secret of Mana beat it out.
Between Maniac Mansion and Final Fantasy V Advance.
Games released in the US, right?
Let's just say there's a reason that they pulled the plug on that magazine and that list will demonstrate it.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Stop getting angry.
I will cut a bitch.
One other thing for you guys.
Did you know that not only is the Wii U region locked, but the gamepads are region locked as well?
LOL what?
Here's the thing.
If you actually try to bring another region's Wii U pad and hook it up or whatever, when it tries to do the console updates, it'll actually tell you the update cannot be completed with an overseas Wii U game pad.
I don't know why the fuck anyone would ever need this.
Why would you be using some other region's game pad?
For when they inevitably do fun colors in Japan that we don't have.
But then you'll have your own... When you buy the unit, you'll have your own... How many spice-colored...
GameCube pads do I have?
I think this is a little ridiculous to get angry over.
Let's get angry over the fact that the Wii U itself is not region locked.
That's where we should be focused on.
It is region locked.
I know, right?
That's what we should be focused on.
You said it's not.
Huh?
You said it's not.
Oh, my bad.
It is regional.
Well, let's be mad.
Let's just be mad.
Let's just be mad at Rob.
Rob Grr.
No.
Anyhow, yeah, I mean, if whatever, okay, and then people are saying, well, what if someday the games do support two gamepads and you have a friend from Europe over?
Fucking get over it.
God, then you just fucking get over it.
That's what you do.
You suck it up and you get over it.
Then you don't play that game.
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
Last stories of the year.
Okay, well, Super Mario Bros.
3 is going to be on the 3DS Virtual Console in Japan.
It's coming out in the new year, and we don't really know when it's going to come out over here, but it's 500 yen.
Yay.
Yay.
What?
This is why your magazine went bankrupt.
I'm sorry.
Burn the infidels.
Hashtag sorry not sorry.
The Guardian legend's not on it.
Neither is Excite Truck, so you know what?
Fuck that.
The best racing game and I think launch title of the week.
Sharpstick Eyeball.
286, 287.
Go figure.
The Wii Sports Resort?
Sharpstick Eyeball.
So, guess what's coming to Battlefield 3 since I just mentioned a second ago?
Dirt bikes.
But no Camaros.
They are going to be adding offered dirt bikes and mechanized horses to Battlefield 3 for the fifth mini-expansion endgame.
And new maps and capture the flag will be out.
Then there will be lightweight AA vehicles and new trooper drops that will poop troops all over.
And last but not least...
There's a trailer for a game that people are losing their shit about.
Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII That's what Rob sounds like on the toilet when he loses his shit.
You're disgusting.
You were the one who lost your shit.
So, Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns Basically, it looks kind of like Assassin's Creed style play with Final Fantasy people in it.
Okay, I'm done.
Alright.
And that's what I said when I saw, you know, Lightning Returns.
I'm like, I don't even care.
I'll buy it.
I'm not even going to try and lie.
Of course I'm going to buy it.
Rob's our consumer whore.
I have the other two.
Heart, heart, heart, heart.
Alright.
That's it for news.
But we do have some other things we want to talk about before the show is over.
We want to get to 2012 in review.
And this is where I would usually play like a bumper or something.
I don't really have any bumper or music.
So when in doubt, just play Dancer.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The question that we are really asking is, what is your top game of 2012?
Because we don't want to get into that whole, you're wrong, you picked the wrong game.
Nope, there's no right or wrong answer to what your, or my, top game of 2012 is.
Opinions can't be wrong, they're just stupid.
Exactly.
So we'll get to this in the Fugle Question of the Week in a minute as well.
But we want to talk about what was your top game of 2012 and why.
Okay.
Garis
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and tweaking the game and figuring out how I can push boundaries in it.
I think I finally figured out how to get all the high-res textures to work in Mass Effect 3.
So that's going to be for my seventh playthrough.
I made an albino shepherd.
I made a blue shepherd.
The modding is so much fun for me.
I will spend three hours working on getting my character to look right before I even do a mission.
You're such a girl.
Shut up.
It's like having The Sims and then actually having a good game.
Fair enough.
And?
And?
Garrus.
Shakerian.
It's Shakerian Sunday.
I posted a picture on MassAffecting.tumblr.com When is Shenko's Saturday?
I guess so.
Shenko's every other day.
No, but it said Shakarian, deal with it.
Alright, let's do some of the ones that are going to be a little less obvious.
Let's go to our guest, Flacco Jones, and then we're going to do Alan as well.
Flacco Jones.
For best game?
Yeah, your favorite.
What's your personal top game of 2012?
I kind of, you know, I had to make a decision because I played two really great games this week, but I'm going to stick with The Walking Dead just because I just love the story and I love how everything you do in the game comes back and...
and it all mattered so it was a great game and you know not terribly long and a pretty good deal like I know you guys are saying you got it for 10 bucks I got it for 20 and I still felt like that was a great deal because it's about 2-3 hours a chapter and you got 5 chapters so 10-15 hours for 20 bucks I think that's pretty good 10 bucks even better fair enough Alan is back with us in studio how are you doing?
Good.
So what would be your pick for Game of the Year?
Well, I almost had to recuse myself from this entire segment because I went through the Wikipedia list of all the games that came out in 2012.
I've played three of them all year.
So it doesn't mean that Mass Effect was the only thing I played, but all the games that I put hours on this year were from last year, 2010, 2009.
So I had three things to choose from.
Black Mesa Source.
it's my best because it came out finally after eight years so it proved all the haters wrong Half-Life got some love and it's just a huge testament of what fan communities are capable of it was flawlessly professionally done and when I say the mod community I mean Skyrim any community that has or any game that has a community that of people that will put out content like this Black Mesa is one of the pinnacle achievements of
everything Minecraft any game with a big enough fandom that lets you add stuff to it so yeah it plays awesome Half-Life hasn't had a game come out for it since 07 with Half-Life 2 episode 2 more time has passed between Half-Life 2 and now than the original Half-Life 1 got its sequel Half-Life 2 so yeah it's my favorite franchise and it got some love so that's my pick
You've watched me play a ton of games, and surely you can form an opinion out of that.
It doesn't count if I don't play it.
Use your own criteria.
The rest of the internet does.
Loki, what is your top game of 2012?
Also, I didn't play that many games during 2012 that came out in 2012.
It was like a handful of games.
I'd have to say probably Borderlands 2 just because it's everything you like from Borderlands 1 plus better writing, more guns and it's just it's fun, it's like everything you loved before amped up to 11 it's great, it's a great game great shooting, lots of I love the writing in it I don't know, I'm really enjoying it I'm enjoying the fact that I'm going back and playing it some more because I kind of stopped playing it for a while when I got busy with Minecraft and everything
That leaves me, huh?
I didn't really want to be predictable this year, but I reserve the right to change this because I still have one or two games I need to finish playing.
So I reserve the right to come back on a future episode and say I changed my mind.
but I think it's going to take a lot to sway me from choosing Mass Effect 3 as my game of the year and a lot of that has to do with the fact that I got into the series this year so I kind of feel like I explored the whole trilogy this year so admittedly a little bit of that spilling over into Mass Effect 3 but it's not really just what Jamie mentioned because what's funny about what she's talking about is that's not what interests me at all in the game and I think that's a testament to the game itself I think the staying power of Mass Effect 3 is the multiplayer
and I'm going to admit, when I first reviewed the game here on OLR, I said I won't give it my game of the year because some of the things in multiplayer ticked me off.
However, I think they've come a long way in correcting some of that, meaning that they have supported the multiplayer
Thanks for watching!
and you know had some great time playing with friends the game as well there really isn't a game I've had a better value on this year with the exception of maybe World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria
for the record.
I really like multiplayer as well.
And you know, I thought I would hate it.
And I ended up really liking it.
I also like finding regular maps in the game that are actually the multiplayer maps later on.
So all that ending bullshit aside, it's not enough to really tarnish what I still feel was an amazing video game.
However...
uh there was a lot of great shit this year and you know Journey really I was really almost wanting to name that just so that we could all have a different one but then I go back and I go but I all the time I spent on Mass Effect 3 I can't I can't Walking Dead however I
might take the crown.
If anything's going to snatch the crown, wait till I finish Walking Dead Episode 5 because I might snatch it.
So we'll see.
Because, you know, when the writing is good, it's like really, really good.
And like Walking Dead has a lot of what I love about Mass Effect, just in a totally different type of universe.
But the whole like decision making that kind of comes back later on, it's just, yeah, there's a lot of that there too.
So I reserve the right to change my answer.
It's just the internet.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
What about it?
It didn't play well, the whole Mega Man thing.
It just felt like a giant insult to the people who were fans of the series.
I can't help but think of the DLC being on disc.
That's what I'm always going to think of.
It's just a combination of a less than stellar game combined with really poor business decision.
The fiscally responsible part of my brain just goes, no, can't do it.
And keep in mind, I didn't buy it.
I borrowed it.
and I gave it back.
So it was pretty bad.
Who went next?
I think Flacco.
Flacco, what would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012?
Well, I didn't play it.
So I guess that's why you can say it's not the worst game.
But I was very disappointed that I heard so many bad things about the Silent Hill HD remake.
That was pretty bad.
Yeah.
See, I've never heard anything good about it.
and it's just I was very disappointed because I was very I was very much looking forward to it I was gonna buy it right away but you know I guess luckily Target didn't have it when it came out and then I heard more and more about it and I was like you know I'm not gonna buy it it sounds like it's a waste of money there's also that crap with them not doing the upgrade
Yeah, that was for 2, right?
In the 2 and 3 collection?
They didn't upgrade the graphics?
Or they didn't do the fog or something?
And the wires are going off into the distance?
It was something about them having done a patch for other versions, but not the Xbox one, I think?
Oh, I don't know about that.
See, that's the thing.
There's so much bad news about that game.
And so many bugs.
And to release a game with that many bugs...
It's just too much.
They needed their best tester back, Jim.
That's the problem.
You left and everything went to hell.
How did this get through?
Get the waiting guy back.
I almost wonder if they took the viewpoint of, you know, we already tested this game.
It's fine.
We're just going to up-res it and stick it out.
It was a total disaster, it sounded like.
I don't know anybody who bought it and liked it.
Oh, Alan.
Alan's next.
Alan, what would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012?
Mass Effect Infiltrator for iOS and Android.
Yeah, that was kind of... Because I got my first smartphone ever finally in September and then I figured out that the data pad, which is like the sort of your characters in your party email you and it's really neat and you can update your galactic readiness, which is a mechanic in Mass Effect 3, through this app.
It's not available for the Android.
So only iPhone users get to do the little cute email character minigame.
So I was like, all right, I'll get the other Mass Effect mobile game, Infiltrator.
You play as Cerberus, dude, and there's also ways that it ties into your three main campaign.
it's awful it's an amazing testament to how good graphics can be on smartphones nowadays but you play with your thumbs and it's really awful and it's not fun at all and it was like eight bucks that I wish I had back because I could buy lunch with that
It's not that good on iOS either.
Was it really $8?
I think I got it on sale for $8.
I want to say it was $12 originally.
I've heard it's no better on the iPad.
Didn't you uninstall it off your iPad?
Yeah, I did.
It takes up a gig and it was just a wasted gig.
No tangible controls makes it a bitch.
Does it work with the iCade though?
I don't know because I don't have one.
I thought that it worked with the iCade but I could be wrong.
It might.
I don't know.
Yeah, but that's all.
I'm trying to remember what the other game was that came out this year that I played.
Mass Effect 3?
Oh, Mass Effect 3, yeah.
Alright, fair enough.
Loki, then I guess we go to you.
What was your most disappointing game that came out this year?
Lollipop Chainsaw.
It was terrible.
It just wasn't a fun game to play.
It was just kind of like, oh, it's Suda51.
It's going to be so really crazy and edgy and stuff.
They tried that with Shadows of the Damned and it was just not very good.
That was a good game.
Really?
I liked Shadows of the Damned.
It was alright.
I liked what I saw of it.
It just wasn't to the level of what I wanted.
I don't know.
I'll drop a whopper on this segment.
I'm going to say the most disappointing game of the year was Diablo 3.
You know what?
Yeah.
And I don't really know how to put it into words.
It's not that I necessarily hate... I mean, here's the thing.
This is very much not... Diablo 3 was not the worst game of the year.
I would say the worst game of the year would be something like... I was going to say Sonic 4 Episode 1, but it only came out on the Windows platform this year, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Somehow the fun got sucked out over the 10 years between Diablo 2 and Diablo 3, and I think a lot of that was Blizzard really not listening to their fan community, so I think they're really going to have to go back and answer to that a bit.
So when you got Torchlight 2, didn't you think that the pick-up-and-go within the first 20 minutes of Torchlight 2 was way more fun than Diablo 3, but Diablo 3 was how many years in the making?
I enjoyed Torchlight 2 in the one hour I played it more than I did Diablo 3 and that says enough right there I think you're absolutely right Torchlight 2 is a better game than Diablo 3 in my opinion so that's that looking at some of the comments in chat room at live.vognetwork.com Fantaz says no way Diablo 3 should win game of the year sorry that's my personal answer I think it wins poop of the year
Act... Acidic Vampire says, disappointing doesn't mean bad.
I think that's a very important point, and yes, I agree with you on that.
TigerClaw says, oh yeah, Blizzard cancelled the Diablo 3 PvP mode.
They didn't cancel... well, Fifth Dream fills it in there.
They didn't cancel it, they just postponed it.
They basically... they realized it was... I mean, that said to me...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This is a free expansion.
I didn't pay for it.
I never got my dance studio, but I think there's a big difference between a Warcraft dance studio and PvP, which has its very passionate fans, even in WoW.
We don't talk a lot about PvP on Horde House because not a lot of it play it, but there is definitely... One thing I learned this week, we haven't talked a lot about it during the show, but we have been...
Thanks for watching!
Lots of that.
Arena, Rated Battlegrounds.
If you're wondering, who's doing Rated Battlegrounds?
Just load up Twitch.
And I imagine any of the competing websites like Ustream and so forth, same story.
There's a lot of that scene going on there.
So it definitely has their passionate fans.
Alright, there we go.
So let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week, because that was everybody, right?
I didn't miss anybody?
Just making sure.
We asked a very similar question in our Fugle Question of the Week.
Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, smash it together, you get Fugle, a question, and we ask them one of the same questions we just asked you guys.
Holy fucking shit.
We got 25 responses on Facebook.
Yep.
I can't read all of these, you guys.
There were about eight after the first minute you posted it.
Yeah, I know.
And I looked before the show.
There was eight.
And I'm like, okay, eight.
I can manage that.
Now there are 25.
I am overwhelmed by you guys being so awesome and replying.
But there's no way I can read all those answers.
Oh, my God.
There's five on Google Plus, too.
There's five people on Google Plus.
Rob, if I have to read 10 emails, you have to read 48 little short responses.
All right.
There's five Google employees that listen to the show?
Alright, I'm gonna really run through these.
I apologize in advance.
I'm gonna really trim your answers to get everybody's answers out there, okay?
Actdeft says Dust and Elysian Tale is the game of the year.
Dust combines RPG, Metroidvania, and beat-em-up style gameplay to make a real fun game to play.
And can you imagine this game was made by only one person?
That's quite the feat.
I was not as huge into Dust and Elysian.
No.
Never mind.
I'm getting that game confused with From Dust.
Very different game.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Yes.
Dust was an awesome game that it was supposed to be an Xbox Live Indie game.
I have not played that yet.
And it actually was so good that it became an Xbox Live Arcade game.
Oh, okay.
Alright, so I will make it a point to check that out later.
I thought, when I first read it, I was like, oh, he's talking about that From Dust game that I played once, and I was like, nah, I'm not as into this.
You know, it's kind of trying to be populist or whatever.
RobbaBubbaBubbaBubba says, My 2012 pick is the iPad version of Pinball Arcade.
It has the most tables and they're all from actual tables.
The iPad is the right size for the portrait orientation.
Good, good tip.
Very good pick.
Nick M replied, he gave two answers.
Big Budget, Halo 4, citing 343's ability to pick up the franchise from Bungie and made the most polished Halo to date.
I gotta say...
Halo 4 was pretty rock-fucking-solid compared to some of the previous Halo efforts.
I really agree with what Nick's saying there.
Smaller Studio, Walking Dead, citing the emotional connection.
Redertainment says, Three very good games I've played this year.
Mass Effect 3, Dragon Age Origins, Assassin's Creed 3.
Remember, it's this year, which you've played.
When I think of a game that I've played throughout the year, got a lot of enjoyment out of, and shared with multiple people, Ticket to Ride on the iPad.
You know the old, the board game, the trains?
All right.
Justin M replied and said, Dokepon Kingdom for the Wii.
It was released a while ago, but me and my partner started playing it obsessively this year.
Good, not so clean because we make it dirty, Monopoly-esque fun.
Now I'm kind of curious.
What's it?
Good, not so clean because we make it dirty.
What's, like, insensitive jokes, or what's that all about there?
All right.
Let's see.
Let's get to some of the answers from Facebook.
You ready?
Here we go.
Degenerate Johnny.
I'm positive I'm not alone when I say Mass Effect 3.
Why?
Garrus.
Just out of curiosity, are you Degenerate Johnny?
No.
No?
All right.
DJ Ranma S said Final Fantasy Theatrhythm.
It was a unique music rhythm game.
Rob himself said Assassin's Creed 3 they did a good job in reinventing a system that's not broken but feels fresh and new with the reasons you liked past games that's very interesting because a lot of people are giving Assassin's Creed 3 shit I haven't played enough of it to see it either way but then again Rob here I am saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the year and there's a lot of people that give that series some shit so you know what I am sympathizing with you
Eric S replied, Tricoro.
Do you guys even know what Tricoro is?
I've heard of it.
Nope.
I've heard of it.
Do you know what it is?
No.
It's 2DX, Beatmania 2DX.
Yeah.
I think number 20.
That's why I don't know.
That's why I knew what it was because it's one of the Bimani games.
Eric S says, Tricoro, because it's Beatmania.
Cram said, Mass Effect 3.
I think the flaws were exaggerated.
By the way, Mass Effect podcast...
Don't give me that look, we're working on it.
Look forward to more exciting things in 2013 from OLR Studios.
All right.
Haseo Sumuragawa says Borderlands 2.
Handsome Jack is the most lovable bad guy ever.
Can't help to giggle when his echoes pop up.
That or Arkham City because Catwoman is a badass.
Actually, even though I didn't play Borderlands 2, that would be Dan's game of the year to say.
I have to say Mad Moxie is awesome.
Naaman Lights says on console Forza Horizon on PC Mists of Pandaria.
Gamer Girl said a mud called Oasis.
Taking it back to the muds.
That's awesome.
You know what a mud is?
That's familiar.
You log into the terminal.
Speaking of text adventures like Zork and all that shit.
Gemstone.
Imagine if you were playing a text adventure MMO.
That's kind of what a mud is.
You go into a terminal.
I don't think I've heard of that before.
They used to be much bigger like 10 years ago.
Oasis won.
That's the Ready Player One.
Oh, okay.
Alright.
GamerGirl says, I love this game because it's my first time playing.
Been playing since it came online a few days ago.
Love it.
DarkTetsuya says, I'm going to change it up and say DDR2 for the Wii because of a great song list.
Flaming Toilet God, I love that username says Journey Thanks to the communication limits there's finally a multiplayer game that doesn't make me hate people.
True story I was talking to, if you listen to Horde House you've probably heard of Sunshine He does the podcast with Spike, Game Boy
and he was talking to me, he'll probably talk about this on his show he was talking about his playthrough on Journey he finally played it for the first time and he said he had a companion that he had through most of the game too and at the very end the companion drew a heart in the snow aww as you have all the feels of that same moment as well that's like Les Mis level crying right there
at the end.
All right.
Yeah, I was always like really chatty in my thing.
I would just be constantly like, I would just be mashing and like, we got to go fast here.
So I'm just going to be like, follow me.
I know which way to go.
Watch out for the big stone dragon things.
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, wait, OLR Studios?
I thought you guys were VOG now.
No, we are VOG.
VOG is the network that many of the OLR Studios shows play on, such as Orange Andreo and Horde House.
But if you look at the way movies are made, sometimes the movie maker is not the same as the distributor.
Go research it on Wikipedia.
All right.
Meanwhile, Veronica S replies and says, Pokemon White version 2 because it's addictive.
Another Pokemon addict.
That's all right, though.
I know a lot of Poke addicts.
Ronnie B replied and said, Far Cry 3.
It motivated me to enjoy gaming again.
That's a pretty big endorsement there.
The environment is alive.
The AI acts responsibly, engaging, and overall a great game.
It's on Steam sale right now.
Ferdinand F replied and said Lone Survivor I haven't heard of that one but he says it scratched the Silent Hill itch I didn't realize I still had I will have to kind of earmark that we like survival horror so
Burr replied and said going by the number of hours poured into it Borderlands 2 same great gameplay refined into perfection and some of the most memorable and funniest lines of the year hands down honorable mention to Assassin's Creed Creed not
Ossifer replied and said Mass Effect 3 keeps coming back long after it's been released only to play through it again and explore new paths in the story or another ending to enjoy multiplayer endorsing that as well more answers Ragenator says Diablo 2 I know it's a 12 year old title but I just got it this year console wise it's a two way tie between Magic 2013 and Super Stardust HD those are two games on Playstation 3 I love the most and put the most time into
Acidic Vampire said, Mass Effect 3, a fantastic finale to a trilogy with the best characters ever written for a video game series.
That's a pretty big endorsement.
Luliana says, Mass Effect 3, it's just that awesome.
Even if I'd played more WoW hours spent, I really wish we got to do more with Rex, but still, ME3.
Dave Falcon said, it's Duke Nukem Forever.
What? !
There are no wrong answers.
There's no wrong answer.
Because I spent a good portion of 2012 playing it and Deus Ex Human Revolution because my fiance got me hooked on it.
Oh, okay.
I see.
You played it because you had to for the fiance.
That's all right.
P.S.
Happy New Year, my gaming friends.
Well, Happy New Year to you as well.
Gino L. said The Walking Dead.
It handled some pretty taboo concepts gracefully and changed the way I think about games.
Change the way I think about games.
That's pretty heavy right there.
Now I'm like super interested.
Shane from Horde House replied and said Mass Effect 3.
What a fucking shock.
Hey.
Most personally impactful game series I've ever played.
Runners up.
Persona 4 Golden and DJ Max Technica Toon.
SSJ100 Matt said I'm going to say NHL 13 while this is no surprise for me given I buy NHL games every year without fail this year is special with the current labor dispute and the possibility of there not being any hockey this year NHL hockey I have to look elsewhere for my hockey fix
Well, I do play and pick up hockey games in real life and go to minor league and college hockey.
NHL 13 is the only way to pay and watch my favorite players and teams play.
That's a depressing answer.
It is sad.
That's the only way to get hockey if you're in the NHL.
I totally get it.
And I think that's an awesome answer in many ways, especially if you're a hockey fan.
But it's just like...
It really puts it into perspective.
They need to fucking figure it out.
We have gone over the fiscal cliff in hockey is what has happened here.
And this just happened like six years ago.
They canceled their season too.
I think it was that long ago.
Shame, shame.
Baseball never recovered from that shit.
No, they have now.
They have now, but it took forever.
But when the next bargaining agreement came by, they signed it and they got it done right away.
They didn't drag this out.
And hockey's doing this now for the second time in less than 10 years.
Wow.
Codeman replied and said The Walking Dead I've never felt so emotionally attached to a game in a long while and this one definitely hooks you Last but not least Alpha Cananogram Hatsune Miku Project Diva F Even though the scratch feature is meh No wrong answers I know but I'm not surprised
Oh, okay.
Good music rhythm game with neat bonuses.
There you go.
I like the variety of answers there.
That was great.
It wasn't all... I mean, of course, there was some Mass Effect, Walking Dead, Journeys, the things you're going to expect to see, but I really liked hearing about some of those other ones, too.
Really, really neat.
So thank you guys for answering, and I went ahead and read just about every answer that actually had a game in it.
I read those answers.
So there you go.
Thank you Facebook, thank you Google, thank you to everybody who's participated.
Was that a new segment for this year or did we debut that last year?
This year.
So thank you for catching on to our new segment this year.
We appreciate it.
DarkSakura, read some emails.
This comes from Grimsley.
Because it's a person I haven't seen before, I'm reading it.
Because I'm nice.
Hey guys, love the show.
I was wondering what the name of the background song you used in one of your segments.
It starts out like Bela Lugosi's Dead, if that helps.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Happy holidays.
What do we have that sounds like Bela Lugosi's dead?
Honestly, because I could only think of the chorus of Bela Lugosi's dead.
So I went and YouTubed it and the beginning sounds an awful lot like this.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
The Google Song, La Bossa Nova de Fabienne from Beatmania.
It was in the hip hop mix in the US.
I think it's from some of the Japanese mixes too.
Anyway, what I did for this listener and for anybody who's asking questions like, what song are you using on Orange Lounge Radio?
I made a post in the VOG Network forums at vognetwork.com click on forums, click on Orange Launch Radio and there's a topic we get more people over there there's a topic, what music do you use on Orange Launch Radio and I gave you all the songs and links to the YouTubes so you can do what you want but how about for our listeners who aren't as in tune with the goth music scene, play a little Bela Lugosi's Dead I was just about to do that except you were like two steps ahead of me was that the entire email?
Yeah, pretty much.
I wouldn't mind reading the rest of the emails to Bela Lugosi's dad.
Hey, and if anyone ever watched, you know, early 2000s SNL, goth talk.
Ah, Azrael, Prince of Dark and of Sorrow.
Prince of Sorrow.
And he works with me at the Cinepan.
All right, here's the nine-minute mix of Bauhaus, Bela Lugosi's dad.
So I thought it has to be the Fugles song.
Uh, Bauhaus.
Named after my favorite art school that got shut down by the Nazis.
But reopened!
But then like all the way towards the end of the song is when it gets into the more familiar part.
But honestly, we would not have certain styles of furniture today if not for the Bauhaus movement.
Just saying.
Don't ever ask an art student to go off on stuff like that.
Anyway, this one comes from Spazinator.
Spazinator.
Hi, gang.
It's your raging neighborhood's raginator.
The strange thing happened that interrupted my plans to get a cat this weekend.
Let's take a minute.
Just sit right there.
I'll tell you how I became the catless raginator.
In Buffalo... Oh, he's doing it as a... Fresh Prince.
Fresh Prince, yeah, but I'm not going to wrap it.
You're moving with your auntie and uncle Garris on the Normandy.
It's a parody.
I get it.
Yeah, I'm not reading it.
Sorry.
Can I wrap it?
I just closed it, but you can do it if you want.
All right.
Ragenator, I will do your email justice.
Give me a moment to set it up.
Okay, I'm going to go ahead to the next one.
This is from Nasty Canasta, and I'm sorry, I don't speak any Spanish other than fuego.
So I'm going to try to pronounce this right.
Is hola y buenos burritos?
Hola y buenos burritos.
I would like to bring to your attention a game announcement that flew under the radar, the Binding of Isaac remake.
I'll only touch on major points announced so far.
Produced and developed by Nicholas, releasing at the end of 2013.
Currently confirmed for PC, PS3, and Vita, Nicholas is in talks with Nintendo and Microsoft to have the game on Wii U, 3DS, and 360.
The remake will support a new pixelated look similar to that of the GBA Zelda's.
All content from the base Isaac game and the Wrath of the Lamb expansion will be included, plus another batch of new content about as big as Wrath of the Lamb is in the remake.
Local co-op confirmed, no online co-op as that would extend development time.
Danny Baranowski returns to compose new and remixed tracks, new playable character, new ending, and new final level that seems likely to appear after the game's shale level.
Anyone interested in finding out more in-depth remake details can go to Edward McMillan's Tumblr at edmundm.com and the Binding of Isaac subreddit on Reddit.
I have also attached some mock-up screenshots made by Edmund himself, Happy Burritos, and Nasty Canasta.
And, yeah, I can't really link these to everybody.
Thank you for the reminder, though.
It was cool.
I remember reporting on this before because we were kind of joking, like, LOL remake of a game that's not that old.
But, yeah, I was interested in it, so...
By the way, Ragenator's email.
The problem is, at the end of it, he turns it into a Rickroll thing, and I'm still a little upset about the time he tried to Rickroll the show, so we are sending Ragenator, I will not be doing that email justice, and we will be sending that email to the round file.
So here you go, Ragenator, here goes your email.
Okay, this is from RawSteelUT.
Hey guys, now that we're all done with Christmas and getting our New Year's resolutions ready and shit, what are you guys looking forward to in the next year in gaming?
Any cool games?
Maybe some cool but ultimately useless gimmick?
Thoughts ahoy!
I'm playing more Mass Effect.
Hold that thought, because we have a list list coming up that is tackling this exact topic.
You read our minds.
Holy shit.
Off topic, one of my friends has a copy of the live-action Rurouni Kenshin movie.
Gonna watch it!
Okay.
Next up, I told you I was reading them all.
Dear Orange Jones Radio, first off, I would like to apologize for any grammar mistakes I may make as I have been very tired.
I love the whole covering my ass in the beginning thing.
If you cover your ass in the beginning, that's fine Alright
she asked if I had a girlfriend and I said that I had but things didn't go well she said well you know you could have told me and I wouldn't have cared one way or another because you're my sister I said well I was afraid because of our beliefs about quote that sort of thing she said are you crazy you're my sister and I care about you and love you so I just wanted to let you guys know that thanks to you all I finally got the courage to come out because of you all just to tell my sister how I felt thanks again sincerely gamer girl
Yeah.
Totally.
and major congrats to you too.
Absolutely.
Sorry, I'm making it about us, but congratulations to you.
And I know that you and I have talked about other things too, so just keep your chin up.
Not you and me, Rob, but me and her.
I know, I know.
I got it.
Hey guys, Sterlach here.
A couple weeks ago, you guys were talking about Konami's VRC6 sound chip for the Famicom.
But did you know there was a step above that?
The VRC7 took the NES's sound capability to a whole new level, placing literally on par with the Genesis slash Mega Drive.
However, only one game used this amazing chip, being the Japanese-exclusive RPG Lagrange Point.
Okay, he linked to YouTube on it for how it sounds.
Rob, if you would actually pull that up for me, I would greatly appreciate it.
I will, sorry, I was yelling at Ranma in chat because Ranma said, who the fuck goes clubbing on Sunday nights?
We used to go, it's not around anymore, so we wouldn't, but the, don't make fun of us, but the goth club was Sunday nights.
The Rage.
It was the Rage, and they changed their name.
What was it called?
Asylum.
No, remember, we went to the Rage for my bachelorette party.
Yeah, I know, but that was, like, and people were- After all the vodka shots, the jello shots and watching Barbarella.
I've been asked, when was the last time you went to Asylum?
And I'm like, I don't know, when did I start OLR?
So anyway, I'm sorry, which one am I pulling up?
Oh, this one?
Yeah, from Sterlok.
Okay, got it.
Okay.
Yes, I wanted to play this.
Okay, so let's listen to a little bit of it, shall we?
I'm going to fast forward a little bit here.
Hey, coming up.
That's a Nintendo game.
That sounds very unlike most Nintendo games you're used to hearing.
I probably picked like a really boring part, but... Looks like Phantasy Star.
Sounds pretty good.
Go ahead.
I'm already most of the way through Chapter 2 of Leon's campaign and I'm through the trickiest section as far as accessibility goes, that being the bell puzzle.
Anyway, enough of my rambling.
I hope you guys are having an awesome holiday season and keep up the awesome job as always.
R.I.P.
Shermie.
Sterlock.
My baby.
That has been the sad part of my year.
You guys have made the holidays even more awesome.
Yeah.
Sorry, I was thinking about my kitty.
Looking forward, not backwards.
I know, I know.
It's tough.
This comes from Robert M. First, just hoping, is that Chiron Beta, Chiron Beta Prime was on your holiday rotation?
Secondly, if any of you have any experience with doing this, does anyone there or in chat know how well an Xbox 360 controller works on Mac OS?
Still a leopard or later.
Finally, does Minecraft support said controller?
I wouldn't know about the Mac side of it, but can you use the controller in Minecraft at all?
In Minecraft?
I use the controller all the time in Minecraft.
I use keyboard when I play.
In fact, if you play on our server, or you just have access to the VOG Network forums, for PC at least, I have an XPatter profile that you can use for the Xbox 360 controller that works perfectly.
It works almost identical to the 360 version, but not quite.
I'm fairly certain there are drivers available for Mac OS.
And I know it probably doesn't help this emailer, but the PlayStation 3 controller actually works with Mac OS.
And now I was told to stop reading this on the air immediately, this part of the email.
No, I'm not going to go any further.
It actually is for me and I'm forwarding it to my personal email.
So you'll hear from me there.
Sounds kinky.
Shut up, Rob.
It was actually really nice.
All right.
How does he know what you're wearing today?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, alright When do I ever wear something that isn't black?
So you're saying they're black Yes Next email I love trolling you guys, seriously
Alright, two emails left.
Greetings, OLR.
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
Now that it's cold on the east coast, I need another form of exercise.
Well, we can't help you with that.
So I set up TDR in my unheated workshop.
I was totally getting back into it and I noticed that my score sucked.
I've played a few times since then and the left arrow works about 25% of the time.
So, Loki, do I buy, build, or hang myself from frustration?
I've researched a lot online and it's hard to find a good pad since they're not made anymore.
Even the metal pads you can find on eBay and Amazon get so-so reviews.
And should I stockpile new pads since dance games are dead?
What would you recommend?
Keep in mind that I'm budget conscious.
Good day, citizens, from your loyal turtle in Philly, SiriusTurtle.
Well, it depends on how much you're going to actually play, because I remember I've looked into great detail as far as pads go, but yeah, you're right.
A lot of them, they're pretty terrible, but there are mods you can do on some of them to make them not so bad, like some of the... I'm trying to think what pads they are.
Thanks for watching!
and Riptide Pad, I think.
And that one cost me, I think, $300 for two.
So that's not too bad.
And if you only need one, it's even cheaper.
And it wasn't too bad, it's just I didn't ground it right.
But now we're just going to remake the whole thing anyways because I have some sheet metal sitting in my garage shed.
I don't know.
I'd go with the home-built pad if you can do that.
Otherwise, the metal pads are alright, but just make sure if you do get one, it's a really thick pad.
I bought some metal pads that were about an inch thick and they bent.
It was really bad.
So just read reviews and ask on some of the music game forums, especially people that are using pads a lot.
And I'd say as far as being... Music console games are kind of dying, but if you want to do the PC simulator scene and that kind of stuff, you're going to have a lot more options available to you.
And that's probably not going to go away anytime soon, so that'd be the way to go.
Alrighty.
Alright, and the last email then, if we're ready?
Mm-hmm.
Hey OLR crew, AZHP here with an option or two on the news stories last week about online services for games like Neverwinter Nights being shut down whereas Star Wars Battlefront for PS2 is still running.
My quote friend who worked at GameSpy told me that when developers stopped paying their fees for their services to stay up, GameSpy would just not shut them down because getting a massive uprising of players getting butthurt that their online games were getting shut down was more trouble to deal with than just leaving the service up.
My guess is that Glue Mobile, the company that bought GameSpy from IGN, is realizing they've made a poor investment on GameSpy.
They paid about $45 million in stock for GameSpy, and the employees are jumping ship because they don't like the new direction Glue is taking them.
Found out about this practice and is trying to write some developers out for games they've stopped paying for.
And those developers are, surprise, not willing to pay for 10-year-old games and are just letting them get shut down.
and just my little insight into the world of video game business, you're truly AZHP.
I don't think it was that they were giving up on them, it's just that they were raising their rates so much that it's just not cost effective for them.
I mean, I think that's really what it comes down to.
I found that part fascinating that they'd rather keep them running than have to deal with the internet rage.
That says a lot right there.
That was it.
I'm eating.
No help, we have dead air.
Okay, Rob, jeez, you have to shove your face with stuff and have me fill in the time.
Garrus, Garrus, Garrus, Garrus, Garrus, Garrus.
I will keep saying Garrus until Rob finishes chewing.
How about FUs?
Okay.
FU goes to AAA because of claim issues from my car accident.
I may not be in a bad spot, but somebody else who was involved in the accident was for things that were proven on record to have been caused by the accident.
Gonna take it up with them and they may be losing a customer.
Loki.
I guess FU to the fact that there's no one on Final Fantasy XI.
It's kind of lonely.
I mean, I like the fact that now I can actually camp the Notorious Monsters if I want to and be able to attack them.
Leap and Liz, he's all yours.
No, seriously.
Like, I ran across them.
Hey, there's a Notorious Monster.
I'm going to fight it.
And I did, and I killed it, and I didn't actually get the drop.
But I was like, hey, that's kind of cool.
They added more of those to it.
Yeah, I've noticed quite a few.
So, it's neat.
And then, of course, you know, the fact that I've got some big projects I want to work on, and I've been just, like, brain-fried lately, and I just haven't been able to concentrate on them.
But some major stuff, hopefully, I'll actually work on this year.
I really need to focus on it.
Alright, my a few of the week goes to my co-host for not knowing how to fill dead air when I'm eating.
We didn't know you were getting food.
Jeez, Rob.
This is Rob.
F you to DarkSakura for furthering berating me during my F you segment.
And just F you to the fact that vacation is flown by.
I have to go back to work on Wednesday.
You do.
I know.
I have to get to work tomorrow.
No, it sucks to be you.
Wi-Fi's a whole week off.
Oh, my gosh.
But, you know, no, in all seriousness, it's been a great mental break.
So I'm like, I'm done.
I'm ready for 2013 to be a kick-ass year.
Woohoo!
By the way, can I throw in a happy birthday to a celebrity?
No.
Yes.
Michelle Nichols turned 80.
Today?
She is a flawless goddess.
She is pretty damn flawless.
I have to... She's actually one of my personal heroes.
I would say the only flaw I could think of possibly for her was that she participated in season two of Heroes.
But otherwise... Otherwise... She did a fan dance at 50.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
All right.
Flaco, you have an FU of the week?
Yeah, F you to vitamin water for making me pee like three times in two hours.
I'm not a pregnant woman, I swear.
You're just getting old like the rest of us.
Holy shit.
It's Vitamin Water's fault, not me.
Your half birthday just recently passed too because mine did.
I'm like, oh, I'm almost 35.
Yay.
All right.
Isn't it fun to be old?
Yeah.
All right.
Let us get to one more segment before we get to the other classic game of the week.
I'll explain in a minute.
And our Twitter topics and so forth.
It is a segment we like to call Listless.
Alright, the way listless works.
We are going to put together the ultimate list.
This is a very scientific process, y'all.
The ultimate list.
We're not going to have the theme music all night tonight.
The ultimate list to discuss the top three of a topic.
And that topic tonight is your 2013 predictions.
Ooh, okay.
So, here's the way listless works.
We're going to go around the room and the folks participating tonight are myself, DarkSakura, Loki, Flacco, and Alan.
We have a five-man listless tonight.
You have a four man and one woman listless.
We have a five person listless time.
There's a woman, so there you go.
You know what?
There's a woman.
My boobs dominate.
Alright, fine, fine.
We have four men and a nag.
Bitch, please.
I will cut you.
All right.
Doing tonight's list.
You know I love you.
All right.
We're doing tonight's list.
We're each going to go around, put three items on the list.
Then we will go around and it's a really tough thing.
We're going to take one answer off the list.
But there's a twist in tonight's list list.
This is a list list twist for 2013.
Twist list?
It's twist list.
Here's the deal because there's so many people tonight.
If somebody gets two of their answers taken from the list, their third answer automatically becomes immune and cannot be taken from the list.
Immunity Idol.
Immunity Idol for an answer.
So if you get two of your answers taken off the list, your other one cannot be eliminated.
May I suggest that we play the whole Tribunal song while we're doing the eliminations?
That might be kind of funny there.
Awesome.
I'll see what we can do.
Alright, so that's the twist this year with List List 2.0.
So anyway, in all seriousness, let's go around and start to form the list.
The chatters will then vote and they will get to put together the ultimate list.
By the way...
and I will throw this out there there actually is another upgrade coming to Listless in 2013 not just the upgrade I previously mentioned but we are going to have a way that podcast listeners can participate in this segment next year so stay tuned we are going to do one segment where the podcasters get to participate as well in 2013 so expect this segment to come back
DarkSakura, what is your number three answer for your 2013 prediction?
Reggie Fils-Aimé will actually reveal that he's Donkey Kong, just shaved.
And why do you believe this will happen?
Look at the man's face!
He's got gorilla face.
and like not Damon Auburn, Jamie Hewlett gorillas.
I mean, he looks like a monkey.
All right.
Wow.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's I don't know.
I don't know.
That one might get eliminated right off.
We'll see.
All right.
Let's see, though.
Moving around the list.
Loki, what is your number three answer for 2013 prediction?
Final Fantasy 11 will go free to play.
and why do you feel that's destined to happen this year?
Because there's very few servers right now and there's hardly anyone on them and honestly if they went free to play I think they would get a lot more revenue.
Alright, fair enough.
And I understand they have Final Fantasy 14 over there and they want people to go to that but why wouldn't you want to keep your old service available?
I guess maybe not the cut into your new one.
I don't know, it's hard to say.
Alright, Flocko Jones, what is your number three answer?
PlayStation Vita versions of first party Sony games are actually going to be made by the same developers Oh, instead of like the whole like license thing?
Well, just like the whole like, yeah, like Uncharted, Naughty Dog doesn't do the Vita version Or LittleBigPlanet, Meet My Uncle doesn't do the Vita version Just stop pawning it off on one of your other developers
The Devil May Cry reboot will flop and bury the franchise for good.
The only good thing it will bring is really hot fan art of new Dante and Chris Redfield.
So there you go, the number three answer from Alan.
Devil May Cry reboot flops and the only good thing it brings is fanfic.
All right.
My number three answer, what did I do in my list here?
Oh, my number three answer is that there will be a Vita price drop before the one year anniversary, which is in a couple months.
And I honestly, I don't think they have any choice at this point.
And I would almost go so far as to say the 3G one gets eliminated totally because why?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Mass Effect fans will get all butthurt because the rumor about the DLC proving indoctrination theory is true.
So DLC indoctrination is true.
Yeah.
And of course, you know, all the fans will get butt hurt.
I'll probably be a bit butt hurt.
For those that are not tapped into the fandom, briefly described what the indoctrination theory is.
Can you do that without spoiling the ending?
Not much.
Basically, okay, there's this thing where there's like a kind of mind control in the game for people who've been around Reaper technology a lot and the Reapers are the big bad guys.
And basically, they can kind of make you do whatever they want you to and think whatever they want you to think.
So maybe the whole ending was hallucinated.
Fair enough.
Alright, let's move on to Loki, your number two answer.
Bandit 2 will flop and the only good thing you'll get from it is fanfic.
Well, didn't I just hear that?
and because of the Wii U. And you think you had trouble with niche games on the Wii?
You haven't seen anything yet.
Alright, so Flaco Jones, what is your number to answer?
The next generation Xbox, the Lube, will be $100 if you sign up for a two year cell phone style commitment and pay a higher tier of Xbox Live, say like $15 a month.
That answer, I hate that answer because it is so probably true.
Like, oh my god, I hate you for saying that because I could see that happening.
So you're basically saying Xbox Lube goes the way of the iPhone.
It's just $99.99 with a two-year commitment to Xbox Live.
Platinum tier.
Platinum tier, exactly what I was thinking.
Oh, you dick.
All right.
Alan, your number two answer.
Watch Dogs and Bioshock Infinite will destroy everyone else's asshole as far as gaming of the year lists.
The only two games that everyone loses their mind over.
Final Fantasy XIV Reborn Not Bad Final Fantasy XIV Reborn
You know what?
That one's not fair.
Why?
I can't say why.
Well, it's a prediction.
Final Fantasy XIV Reborn turns out to not be that bad and it's the first time they've ever reversed course on an MMO and it works.
We'll see.
Alright, so so far we have Reggie reveals he's actually Donkey Kong.
Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.
Vita ports made by the same developers.
Devil May Cry reboot flops.
Vita price drop before the one year anniversary indoctrination DLC ending but hurts Mass Effect fans Bayonetta 2 will flop but yay fanfic the Xbox Lube is $100 with a commitment Watch Dogs and Bioshocks blows up game of the year lists and other things Final Fantasy 14 Reborn not bad gif alright so now we get down to the number one answers DarkSakura
Compile will rise from the ashes, not as Compile Heart, and bring us a new Guardic game.
As in, Guardic Gaiden was the Guardian Legend.
One of these years, I'd like you to be right.
All right.
Loki, your number one answer.
The Wii is gonna flop.
And the reason I say that is because they're not going to have any good games coming out.
And I'm not talking about Pikmin.
Yeah, some people like Pikmin, but Pikmin does not fucking sell systems.
I'm talking about Mario, Zelda, not until fourth quarter 2013.
And so basically you're going to have a big nine month dead period.
At least more than nine months where it's just going to dip down to nothing because...
It's not selling like hotcakes now.
Don't get me wrong.
They've got lots of systems out there right now.
We don't know how many systems they have out there, but they're not selling out.
And that's not good to not be selling out right now.
Granted, I know their supply is a little bit better, but it's not that much better.
You just popped in my head.
Flippity-floppity Wii U is on its way.
Flaco Jones, your number one prediction for 2013.
Skyward Sword will be ported to the Wii U replacing the innovative motion control with innovative touch control.
When you're talking about motion control, they're just going to do motion control with the gamepad.
It'll be the exact fucking thing again.
You have to use the screen.
Skyward Sword to the Wii U with touch control.
It's new control Skyward Sword.
Yes.
Alright, fair enough.
Alan, your number one answer.
Bioware will continue to support Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with DLC and weekend events through at least June I would like that to be true Alright, from a true fanboy I would still get my regular updates through June Alright, and my number one answer the last one for the list before we do the elimination rounds No PlayStation 4
I think everybody's expecting it to happen.
I don't think it will.
That's a very serious reply.
I think the new Xbox will happen.
I don't think Sony needs to recover on the Vita right now.
I don't think they're under any pressure to get the PlayStation 4 out.
Try to learn from the Wii U and the Xbox launches.
I think it's the smart thing to wait if you're Sony.
But we'll see.
I say no PlayStation 4 in 2013.
Alright, so there it is.
15 things on the damn list right now.
Reggie as Donkey Kong, Final Fantasy XI goes free to play, Vita ports made by the same developers as PS3, Devil May Cry reboot flops, Vita price drop before the one year anniversary, DLC indoctrination ending butt hurts Mass Effect fans, Bayonetta 2 flops, but fanfic.
The Xbox Lube is $100 with a commitment Watch Dogs and Bioshock Game of the Year list Final Fantasy Reborn, not bad, JPG Compile will rise from the ashes with a new Guarded game Wii U will flop Skyward Sword goes to Wii U with touch control Mass Effect multiplayer through June and no PlayStation 4 Now we get to the very tough part of the round
Alright, that's actually not the music I would have used.
Some of these YouTubes are labeled very strangely.
Let's do this theme song here.
Let's turn this for the vote off.
Ah, much better.
That's it.
Alright, so here we are at Tribal Council.
Will you tell me about how Russell wronged you and how you're going to vote his ass out tonight?
Alright, for real.
Here we go.
Going around and eliminating items that are not worthy of the list.
Remember, if two of a person's items get eliminated, the third answer becomes immune.
So, DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Sorry, Alan.
I'm going to take out the Devil May Cry reboot because there is such a huge fanbase that it will make its money back just from fanbase alone.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Dante's pretty hot, don't get me wrong.
All right, who is next?
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
I'm going to have to say Compile.
It's not going to happen.
We've got to be real here.
All right, Compile, Rising from the Ashes.
It just ain't happening.
It's a wonderful pipe dream, but it's just not going to happen.
Alright, fair enough.
Then we will go to Flacco.
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
I can't decide because they're all going to happen.
I guess I'll just have to give DarkSakura immunity and say Indoctrination.
You're going to take Indoctrination off the list?
You're going to give Reggie is actually a shaved Donkey Kong immunity because I'm a little... There's something about that answer that worries me a little bit.
I don't want to go there.
Other people agree with me.
But...
He looks like a gorilla!
I really want to just get that answer off the list.
I don't want to give an immunity, so Flaco, I'm going to really tell you.
I changed my answer.
Thank you.
So you're changing your answer too?
Reggie!
Alright, that's a good one.
More Mass Effect!
Mass Effect gets immunity.
So Mass Effect gets immunity.
There we go.
I should have added that, you know, what was it?
Who is it that they always have during those...
Oh, it's Iwata.
Iwata's gonna be holding like a human head the next Nintendo conference thing that they do because he's always holding something weird like a banana or some weird shit.
Okay, there's a universe of difference between a banana and a head.
Maybe a shrunken head.
Yeah, but it's weird though.
He's just like bananas.
Think of it this way, Flaco.
Mass Effect fans getting butt hurt by something, that's a given.
That will happen.
I don't know if you should eliminate it.
Anyhow, let's go to Alan.
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
Generally, whenever I eliminate something, the chatroom hates me, so I'm really going to try and keep the more controversial ones up and get rid of the more normal ones.
I'm going to take off Final Fantasy XIV Reborn isn't bad.
Maybe, perhaps, of some bias.
I don't know.
You think it will be bad.
Alright, that's fair, that's fair.
Alright.
Uh, what?
I was gonna say, it's some bias of the person who said that statement.
Alright.
Uh, then that leaves me.
So which of Alan's answers should I get rid of?
No.
Uh, alright, so my turn to figure out which of these is not worthy of the list.
Um... Um... Oh, did you not get rid of one, Matt?
I did.
You did, right?
Oh, okay.
Uh, I'm gonna get rid of, um... I don't know.
Uh...
are all going to happen.
They're all going to happen.
They really are.
Okay, I'm going to get rid of Vita ports are made by the same developers because that's not going to happen.
Yeah, it's never going to happen.
That's never going to happen.
That's true.
It would happen if they actually wanted to save the Vita.
All right.
Yeah, if they really wanted to save the Vita, maybe, but no, that's not what's going to happen.
All right.
So here's the ones you can actually vote on.
We have Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.
Vita price drop before the one year anniversary.
DLC indoctrination ending but hurts Mass Effect fans.
I kind of butchered the grammar there, sorry.
Bayonetta 2 will flop, but fanfic.
The Xbox Lube is $100 with commitment Watch Dogs and Bioshear Trample Game of the Year list Wii U will flop Skyward Sword goes to Wii U with touch control Mass Effect Multiplayer through June which that's the one I really should have got rid of oh well and no PlayStation 4 so there it is you guys can place your vote now send your private message to Rob Roberts in the chat room with your number one and your number two answers for which of those you think will be the case
and we will tally up the results and get to that at the end of the show.
Alright.
Thanks for playing, guys.
Here's your immunity idol for playing.
Alright.
For life.
It's your immunity idol for life.
For life.
Was she the only one that got an immunity idol?
Yeah, she's the only one that got an immunity idol.
This time.
I think I should have a queen hat.
Or chocolate.
Okay, Alan, sit on Jamie's head.
Alright.
Alan's too tall.
All right, what does that leave for the segments here?
Oh, we've got to do this.
We have to do a very anticipated moment here in 2012 because remember when the power went out during the last show that Flaco Jones was on, his segment got cut and he never got to do it.
And literally he was in the middle of the segment talking about it like this and then he's like sad because the power.
What happened?
Why is it dark?
Why is it dark?
All right, so we are going to allow Flaco Jones tonight.
Yes, we're going to do two of these segments this week.
We're going to allow him to do his makeup classic game of the week tonight.
So making up for the show that was lost in May, Flaco Jones, what is your classic game of the week?
My classic game of last May is Chrono Cross.
Yay.
Good pick.
Really good opening theme.
Amazing music.
I have to find, actually, a Chrono Cross video.
There was one song in there that I really liked.
The girl who stole the stars.
The girl who stole the stars.
Yeah, yeah.
And it was an S word, and I was like, stole?
Yeah.
Is that the ending title theme?
I don't remember.
I just know that it's a piece I really like from that game.
My wife got me the soundtrack.
Last Christmas.
It's amazing.
Well, here you go, so you can all enjoy Christmas.
Yay!
Hell, come on.
One of the best parts.
The many best parts of the game, if that makes sense.
Made by Square in 1999 for Japan and 2000 for North America.
It's technically the third game in the Chrono series, followed by Chrono Trigger in 1995 and the Japanese-only text-based game Radical Dreamers in 1996.
It's set 20 years after the events in Chrono Trigger.
The game focuses on Surge, this kid who stumbles into an alternate dimension where he died 10 years earlier.
It created a schism in the timeline that was saved by your party in Chrono Trigger.
He teams up with a mysterious thief named Kid on a mission to stop a demi-human named Lynx who is trying to use Surge's displacement in time for his own evil purposes.
So as you play through the game, one of the coolest parts is you get to have a lot of people in your party.
Now, it's only like the typical three-person party, but you can recruit up to 45 people and swap them in and out pretty much however you please.
And they all have different, you know, base powers and things like that.
But the only way to obtain all 45 of those characters is to play through the game three times.
And I beat this game five times, so I've gotten all the characters.
A lot of them have their own unique little dialogue quirks.
To do this, they coded a script generator to change the standard dialogue for all these special characters so they wouldn't have to rewrite and translate for all the different ones.
Outro Music
See, they also built the battle system from the ground up.
It doesn't use magic points, because as you attack, you use stamina points, and with each successful attack, you gain access to higher-tiered elements on your elemental grid.
Each element is tied to a color that affects the field of battle, and those are tied to basic elements like fire and water, nature, earth, and something else.
Let's see.
Based on how you manipulate the field, you can do more damage, and that's kind of received some flack for the game because it is easy in that sense, along with the whole grind-free aspect of it.
The combat system is pretty easy to figure out, and once you do, and you can just manipulate the field, you can own stuff super fast in this game.
Let's see, it received extremely well by critics.
It had a perfect 10 on GameSpot, 36 out of 40 on Famitsu, and 97 on IGN.
The game shipped over a million and a half copies and was re-released as a Greatest Hits version.
It does have plenty of detractors, with the most common complaint being it isn't Chrono Trigger 2.
The game's creators never intended it to be a true sequel to Chrono Trigger, as they wanted to build a new game from the ground up for this new platform, PlayStation 1, not new at that point, but new compared to Chrono Trigger.
They didn't want to just have another game that looked like Chrono Trigger playing on the PlayStation.
Well, plus there was such a difference between Final Fantasy 6 and 7.
Yeah, exactly.
Chrono made a very similar kind of jump.
And the game, I think, also pissed off a lot of fans because as you play the game, you realize some characters from Chrono Trigger died.
So you're like, oh, so that means there probably can never be a true Chrono Trigger 2 because this person's dead.
But, you know, it's time travel, so you never know.
Chrono Trigger could come back maybe someday.
They could do whatever they want.
They could do whatever they want.
It's time travel, and it's magic, and who cares?
it's still a great game let's see oh yeah okay and then this is what I was going to end on was the music is the best nobody can really complain about that it's my favorite part of the game and I got the soundtrack like I said the highlights are Time Scar and I love Magical Dreamers I love the end credits song
and uh yeah just a kind of game you can just sit and listen to the music to if you you can just leave it on that menu screen and just let it go and that's just time scar over and over and over attract mode you know on Chrono Trigger I used to let it sit in um Zeal and just play that music over and over again and Shala's music
I love that they kept just that awesome, the musical style was, it kept the same style at least.
And she plays a big role in Chrono Cross.
You know, I never got that far into it.
You know what, though?
I've got the game.
It's another critique of the game.
It's almost like they could have changed one little thing about a certain character in Chrono Cross, and I think it would have made a huge difference to maybe fans of Chrono Trigger and the shawls.
But I guess you've got to play it.
I'm not going to spoil it, even though this game is like 12 years old or whatever.
All right.
Well, there it is, your classic game of the May.
Classic game of the May.
Chrono Cross.
Thank you for watching.
I'm glad you finally got to give the game its due here on the show.
I love this game.
I know.
We all know that you love the game.
We're going to open up the Skype line.
We don't have a whole lot of time for calls tonight because we're running very long.
It's damn near a four-hour show tonight.
So 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Launch Radio, all one word, if you want to give us a call.
And we will take some of your calls.
We will do the listless results here shortly.
I just wanted to give it one.
or a minute for votes because we have a massive tie going on right now.
So I just wanted to see if that tie would get broken, but it doesn't look likely at this point.
So we'll see.
I'm also going to do tweets real quick here at twitter.com slash OLR, but I need my iPad for that.
So Loki, do you have any last minute story?
Probably not, huh?
No, I do.
I won.
Oh, Rob, see?
This is kind of sad, actually.
You may remember the last few years we haven't had a new NBA game, NBA Elite, well, NBA EA NBA game, like NBA Live or NBA Elite or whatever you want to call it.
So NBA Live 10, the last NBA game released by EA, is going to have its online support shut down January 11th.
So if you're still playing NBA Live, you're done.
But go act really angry on the internet because apparently that works.
It worked with GameSpy.
You never know.
Alright, we have a call on the line.
Let's get to it.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, it's Shane.
Hey, Shane, how you doing?
I'm good.
Did you like the Konami stories that Jim was telling us earlier?
There are so many other ones that are really funny that he missed, like the fact that there was the one guy when we were doing Karaoke Revolution that couldn't sing at all, and nobody could be in the same room with him while he tested because we would all laugh too hard, so we'd have to go other places.
Me and one of the guys had to go in the storage closet because we wanted to laugh so hard at it.
I forgot about that, yes.
There was a guy that was so bad at Karaoke Revolution it sent you back in the closet.
Yes.
Alright, amazing.
Alright, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?
One, you did not pick the right number one for your list list as I gave you a better number one that is probably more likely to happen than anything on the list list.
And what would that answer be?
Verbatim, I put your number one will be Shane will find a game he loves and gets Rob and Jamie to fall madly in love with it as well.
Only if it's more Mass Effect.
That's what you say now until I find something.
He's trying with Persona.
No, not yet.
I will not try yet until I beat it, but it will happen.
Whatever.
It's really, really good.
It's not worked with Skylanders.
I'm not doing that.
I'm not going to try to get you into Skylanders.
I promise.
I don't want to be into Skylanders.
All right.
But you are.
No, what I was really going to say is, and something I think we talked about before, is that when I was doing my own, like, what games did I love this year, my top five, four of them were Vita games, which seemed a little ridiculous to me.
So just because the system kind of sucks doesn't mean that the games are awful, too.
Let me guess.
That must be Luminous, Persona, Gravity Rush?
Nope.
I didn't beat the game yet.
Sound Shapes.
And DJ Max.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
Those are all still really great games.
And PlayStation Plus makes it easier because I got four games from PlayStation Plus now on there too that I can play and love.
This is the part of the year where all the websites are doing their best and worst of 2012.
And like Yahoo, I don't know why I read Yahoo, but I do.
They have their worst of 2012 in tech.
And the Vita inevitably made the list.
And there's a lot of websites where the Vita made the worst in tech list.
But yet we have the golden rule of gaming.
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
If the games are so good on the Vita, why is the Vita flopping?
The price sucks, and as, you know, Flaco Jones says, the first-party games that should be made by their actual devs are not, and so they're not as good.
With the exception of LittleBigPlanet.
I think that game's fun on Vita.
I really like it on Vita.
Yeah, LittleBigPlanet's good on Vita.
But, god, Uncharted.
They were still involved in some capacity, and I think that was important.
Uncharted feels like a bad cell phone knockoff of Uncharted.
It's terrible.
That was almost on my disappointing list, but I didn't really play enough of it to really say that.
You don't need to.
Just play like five minutes and then try to do one of the stupid rubbings or aiming in that game or climbing with the touchscreen.
That's terrible too.
We were talking about this earlier.
What would you say was your most disappointing of 2012?
um my game's Guild Wars 2 I just it was not as good as I was expecting with all the time and effort they put into it um I would even throw in Mists of Pandaria I have way too many issues with this game uh this expansion uh I will also say oh god what else did I tell you I told you Uncharted because I thought that was really bad both Uncharted Uncharted 3 or was that last year
I don't know, it wasn't good either.
Uncharted 3 was last year.
Okay, well, it's terribleness bled over into this year too.
You know what?
This is going to be terrible coming from me, but I'm slightly disappointed with the latest Pokemon game because it didn't hold my interest.
I haven't even beaten it yet.
Wow.
Now Pokemon.
I kind of can't believe that you would say that.
I know.
I only have five badges and there are like too many other games I'd rather play than Pokemon right now, which is very depressing to me.
Somebody put Pokemon White 2 as their game of the year.
Well, that's their wrong opinion.
It's cool.
How did I know you were going to say something like that?
Because I'm a jerk.
Well, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
Um, no, I don't think so.
I was trying to think of another funny Konami story before I got off the Skype.
But I, oh, one of the times where we went drinking at lunch, somebody in the room I sat in, they drank too much.
So they got sent home early.
And then as a sign of solidarity, I left early too.
Yeah.
Sign of Solidarity.
It also was on a Friday, so it wasn't that bad of an idea.
All right.
All right.
That's it.
I'm going to let you go.
You can tell more stories when you come to California and guest on the show again.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
We can probably fit in one more call.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Were you done with last minute stories, Loki?
Are you good?
I'm good.
All right.
Reading some of the tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
SSJ100Matt tweeted us saying, I won't be listening tonight because I will be seeing The Hobbit for my birthday.
Happy birthday, by the way.
Whoop-deesh.
No, I'm kidding.
Happy birthday.
I hope you like 10 minutes of dwarves singing.
No, I'm just kidding.
I haven't seen it yet.
I'm not going to hate.
But I would like to wish you all a happy new year.
Well, happy new year to you, too, and happy birthday.
Let's see.
Actdeft tweeted us wanting us to know that Austin Wintory of the Journey soundtrack fame released all his music on Bandcamp for Pay What You Want.
AustinWintory.Bandcamp.com.
That's pretty awesome.
And great soundtrack for Journey, by the way.
Also, I did want to say there is another game that is up on the top of my list.
It's Street Fighter X Mega Man.
Dirty Pair
That, too.
Do you know how much freaking anime I have sitting on my shelf I've bought over the years and yet to watch?
I just finished the first season of Sailor Moon.
What does that tell you?
Really?
I've watched, like, the whole run of it three times now.
In Japanese.
Just imagine how many people are going to be watching it right before the premiere of the new series.
I need to be on Anime Jam Session, dude.
It's going to happen.
Episode 100 is coming soon and we got some shit in store, you know?
Nice.
Very cool.
Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
Oh, the whole Shamestop debacle.
Oh, you're talking about the porn thing?
I'm sorry.
I have to laugh when Shamestop says they have standards and practices on their refurbished consoles.
I'm sorry.
How can you call it refurbished when I walk in and sell it and 10 minutes later someone comes in and buys what I just sold you?
That's not refurbished.
Standards and Practices is the firing department, let's be real.
Standards and Practices, human resource, the whole nine yards.
I mean, they don't really care.
I mean, I sold them my DS fat with a broken L button.
They didn't give a damn.
I should have sold them my broken iPhone, but I ended up giving that to my dad because he'll try to fix it, knowing him.
All they're going to do is turn it on, see if it powers up, that's it, done.
Wow.
Easy enough.
Exactly.
And this is why I try not to shop there unless I truly had to.
Last time I went there, I bought NCIS for my 3DS.
Come to find out, if I waited an extra day, I could have gotten it from Nintendo World for the same price.
Yikes.
What's been your favorite in gaming this year?
Well, like I said, it was Final Fantasy Theater Rhythm, but it was a toss-up between that and Mario Kart 7, because you know I love my Mario Kart.
Mario Kart's good times.
Yes, especially when we were playing during the breaks.
Rob, you've got to bring that back.
Especially at Anime Jam Session.
You probably play it on there too, but at Anime Conventions, I'm sure there's lots of breakouts of various DS titles and so forth.
Yeah, I mostly see it's Mario Kart or Tetris.
Right now, the big thing is Pokemon.
That's what everyone is doing.
Very cool.
What about disappointing games this year?
Is there anything you want to call out as disappointing?
Well, I didn't play a lot of games this year, but I don't think there was anything disappointing, but...
Assassin's Creed 3
Gotcha.
All right.
Well, we're going to let you go, but good luck with your show in 2013.
Good luck with Anime Jam Session.
I look forward to Episode 100 and when you guys inevitably go live at some point, right?
Well, I might as well say that's part of what we're working on for 100 because of all the extra equipment I've been buying over the last couple of weeks to get things going.
Nice.
So it sounds like we'll be chatting in the coming weeks.
Oh, you got that right.
All righty.
All right, take care, buddy.
Have a safe new year.
You too, and stay fabulous and don't get too drunk.
I will.
Stay black.
Bye buddy Bye
I heard the thing about John Woo directing the movie, but apparently he links us to a report on Kotaku via Twitter that says, yeah, it ain't happening.
An interview with the producer Brad Foxhoven, former producer in IGN, Nintendo surprisingly gave its blessing to the project, because obviously they didn't like Super Mario Bros.
at first, but they thought with John Woo it would be better, but I guess they couldn't do it, and a lot of it had to do with Samus' backstory.
that they wanted to explore making a movie about her.
But Nintendo, I guess, wanted to be the ones to answer those questions, not have it answered in a movie.
Let's go to one more call.
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up?
It's Tiger Claw.
Hey, Tiger Claw, and it's video.
Just like, remember I said a couple weeks ago that I wanted to get more video calls?
And we even have the cam, which we need to get on the show, but maybe in 2013.
Well, how you do, Tiger Claw?
Oh, I'm doing fine.
Earlier in the show, you guys mentioned about the VOG Network leaderboard and stuff and how I'm still in the top on there.
That's right.
He's number one for the year if you look at overall score, I believe.
Is he really?
I think so.
I worry on Bobby Blackwolf telling me all that stuff.
But no, I wanted you to call in and talk some shit, and here you are.
This is great.
So are you here to trash talk Flaco Jones a little bit?
I just want to know is how has he managed to get first place because I don't know where he's getting all those extra points.
He's doing it because he gets a lot of people somehow to reply to his comments.
I do a lot of comments.
He does so many comments he gets people to like him and reply to him and I think that's how he's doing it.
That's how I do it.
He may have to change up his strategy in 2013 because there is going to be some, not so much changes, but we've been promising we're going to change up the game a little bit.
And so the game will be evolving in 2013.
The game has changed.
That's right.
The game has changed.
It sure definitely did.
But anyways, for anyone out there that wants to try to get their hands at the leaderboard, all you have to do is one simple thing is to basically go to the website every single day.
That is all.
Check in all the shows.
Check in all the shows.
Go to the site every day because there will be a day where you'll get a loot for actually visiting the site every day.
Don't go giving away all the games secret.
And all that stuff.
It's a good thing you're revamping the game.
It's a good thing the game's shifting in a little bit.
We've already said all the strategies tonight.
And also, please like people's comments.
If someone writes a comment saying that it was a good show, whatever, you should like it.
If there's something positive about your show, I think it deserves a like.
New Ways to Play
And hopefully in the future, which I know you guys are probably planning, maybe you'll get loot for posting in forums or something like that.
You never know.
We don't want to encourage post-touring, but we do want to encourage participation.
You never know.
You never know what might happen with that.
But since you kind of brought up the whole VOG thing and all that, I did at some point, since it is the last live show of the year and so forth, there were a lot of changes this year, obviously, that they could have gone...
many different ways and you guys really kind of embraced this whole VOG idea which in many ways was fucking insane to be doing but so many of you guys have just embraced it and like you and Flaco both just kind of you know running with the game and not just you guys you know like Actdeft, Immortal King all those guys you see they're just hopping the leaderboards and everybody has been participating it's just been so fun and we can't wait to just kind of like continue on that for 2013 and I really want to thank
Everybody that's kind of jumped on board with VOG in the hosting community as well.
Brad from PodCulture, John from Critical Myth, Brian from British Invaders, Travis and Jess from Understation Live, Rama from Anime Jam Session, Syl from Girls Gone Wild, myself twice.
But I really want to thank just everybody who's really jumped on board with all the other shows.
And we're hoping to expand the lineup even more in 2013.
And just everybody who's been really excited about this.
We want to do more video.
There's so much more we want to do.
And we're just hoping we can get the resources to do it.
Speaking of the live video stuff, you've been recently broadcasting some live gameplay.
That's a thing.
That's a new thing we want to do.
It's a great way to promote and so forth.
Yeah.
If I remember, Rob, didn't you get XCOM?
I don't know if you got it for PC or something.
I did play it on PlayStation 3.
I played it the week we didn't have a show.
I didn't play really a lot of it because I kind of decided it was something I wasn't super into.
I'm so bad at tactical games.
I don't know.
Also, it just kind of made me want the old ones again.
I was like, I don't want all this newfangled stuff.
Just give me the old XCOM games.
Next time you play it, you should name all the soldiers after people you know.
And then at some point when they die, you start feeling bad about it.
Oh, DarkSakura just got shot in the face by an alien.
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?
Dying of dysentery.
It is kind of the new version of somebody dying of dysentery.
I'm getting a look.
This is why it's too bad we don't have the video yet, but soon.
Hey, two words.
What?
Bite me.
All right.
Tigerclaw, I should probably let you go so we can wrap up everything, but I do want to thank you for your support with VOG and everything this year.
And do you have anything else you want to get out before we wrap up the show?
Well, I would like to wish you all a happy new year.
Same to you.
And just hoping for bigger and better things for VOG Network in 2013.
It's already awesome.
No, yes, of course.
Bigger and better is always good.
Yes, we were striving for more in 2013.
Alright, guys, so I guess I'll see you later.
Alright, take care, buddy.
Have a safe new year.
Alright, you too.
Alright, bye-bye.
Bye.
That's a great way to close out the show, I think, tonight.
Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.
I do see the skyline still lighting up.
Please consider sending an email.
Give DarkSakura tons of shit to read next week.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com He's killing you and then making you work.
Before, I know, first I got an alien to shoot you in the face.
Alright.
Rob, you're being a ho-bag.
I am being a ho-bag.
Alright, before we wrap up the show, we have to reveal who won Listless!
Here it is, the top four as voted on you, the listeners.
This is a crazy situation, but we have a top four tonight because we have a three-way tie for second place.
So here it is, the three answers you voted in second place tonight.
Final Fantasy XI goes free-to-play.
Lots of fans of free stuff.
A Vita price drop before the one year anniversary.
Again, fans of cheap things.
And I don't know what this says about cheap, but also tying for second place tonight, the Xbox Lube is $100 with a commitment and the Platinum Live program.
So there it is.
They're all money related things.
But the number one answer is...
for 2013 predictions as voted by you, the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.
No PlayStation 4.
There it is.
It is done.
Sign it, seal it, deliver it.
Tell Sony, wait and make it better.
Don't rush it.
Don't pull a Vita.
Don't pull a Vita.
All right.
Games, games, games.
Developers, developers, developers.
Wait a minute.
Wrong show.
Sorry.
All right.
That is really going to wrap it up for us tonight, but not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
I want to thank Alan for being on the show tonight he's in the other room if he runs in here by chance I'll let him say something but Flaco I'm so happy you made it through a full show and not just that but probably our two shows might be our longest show of the year I know right well we had to make up for not being here last week but thank you I know you have to stay up late and you've got kids and you had drove an hour to get here so at least I don't have to work tomorrow there you go so seriously thank you for being here and come back again when you can
I'll try.
I'll try.
I love being here.
And thanks for being so enthusiastic about the network.
Like, for real.
Like, it means a lot.
I think I live on the website.
That's what we want people to do.
It's great talking to everybody on there.
We need Lil Flacos.
Flaco clones.
Actually, we have some other people to do, too.
Obviously, we just talked to Tiger Claw.
He's pretty good about that, too.
Anyway, in all seriousness, have a great new year.
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Watch Community when it comes back.
It's my favorite show.
Your shirt is great, by the way.
The 8-bit style shirt.
Where did you get that?
It's from the NBC website because it's an episode of Community.
They're all in an 8-bit game.
It's a journey to the center of Hawthorne.
But they need to just chop Chevy Chase out.
Well, he already left the show.
That's the best thing.
Watch this season because you realize at the end he's going to leave the show.
The worst part of the show is going to be gone.
Of course, it's probably going to get canceled too.
Don't.
All right.
It's the last season.
It's running, by the way.
No, it wasn't planned last season.
No, it was this.
The Office and Parks and Rec, I think, are the last season.
No, not yet.
It's not official.
It's over, but it's not official.
It's 30 Rock.
Yeah, 30 Rock is the one that's on its last season.
But, yeah, they're going to run their Christmas show in, like, March or something.
It's going to be bad.
But I still love it.
Why is a cynic vampire saying, yay, community, Annie's boobs?
Annie's boobs.
Hashtag Annie's boobs.
I thought he was talking about your wife and I was going to be a little defensive for you because you left chat.
Annie's boobs is the name of a monkey on community.
Don't talk about his wife's boobs like that.
All right.
Anyhow.
Got to watch the show.
Got to watch the show.
Boobs are monkeys.
What?
You guys are all lost because you need to watch this.
No, I don't watch Lost.
If Reggie looks like a monkey, then he looks like boobs.
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
Monkeys.
My final thought tonight is, as I always say, help us spread the word about our show, about VOG.
Word of mouth is all we got, so tell a friend about what you heard here.
Thank you to everybody who has helped make this year a success.
Thank you to everybody who supported us through big changes.
Thank you to everybody who's continued to support us, supported other projects, supported other indie shows, even if it's not even a VOG show, if it's just an indie show.
Thank you for supporting podcasting.
Because some people try to say podcasting is dead, and to that I say...
Hell no.
As long as there is a microphone and a computer, podcasting will live on.
How come nobody told me that?
I know.
I didn't get the memo.
So we'll be back to do it all again next year.
Episode 500 next year, you guys.
And maybe, by slim margins, although it's not too likely, but maybe you'll win the podcast awards.
Oh yeah, that's coming up soon too, but we didn't buy a ticket to the ceremony, so we're probably not going to win.
It's good to be nominated.
It's great to be nominated.
It feels really good.
I meant it to win it!
So buying a ticket gets you how many more podcast award points to get there?
I'm not going to shade the whole thing.
It is what it is.
As long as an indie podcast wins, I will be happy, and I'm pretty sure one is going to win.
I'm in it to win it.
All right, that's it.
We're done.
We're out.
Good night.
Have a wonderful week.
