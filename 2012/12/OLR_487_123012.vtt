DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, December 30th, 2012, one console

00:17.400 --> 00:18.760
ends production.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.660
Could adult movies really soon be on the Wii U?

00:21.660 --> 00:31.820
Can we look back at the best and worst of 2012?

00:31.820 --> 00:35.900
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.900 --> 00:37.940
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.940 --> 00:47.280
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 487 for this December the 30th of 2012.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.480
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about

00:50.480 --> 00:55.840
video games, video gaming, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, gamer, we haven't

00:55.840 --> 00:57.780
thought of it yet, with my co-hosts.

00:57.780 --> 00:59.240
Say hello to DarkSakura.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.240
Hi.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.000
How are you DarkSakura?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Caffeinated.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.520
Or Jamie Summers, depending on how people want to call you.

01:06.520 --> 01:07.520
Or awesome.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.560
Or awesome, Miss Awesome, Queen of Awesome.

01:09.560 --> 01:10.560
Yes, that's right.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.440
You excited for New Year's Eve?

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
I guess.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
Big plans?

01:14.440 --> 01:15.440
No.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.160
Okay, Dan's gonna have the relatives over and my plan is to be playing Mass Effect from

01:20.160 --> 01:23.440
the New Year rolls in and drinking, which are my two resolutions.

01:23.440 --> 01:27.200
I was just gonna say, you made a Facebook post the other day with your New Year's resolutions.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.320
My New Year's resolutions, actually I had four things.

01:29.320 --> 01:35.080
I think it was to drink more, to play more Mass Effect, to play more WoW, which actually

01:35.080 --> 01:38.600
I have been slacking, and to do more art.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.020
Usually you don't see people resolve to play more video games, you see people resolve to

01:42.020 --> 01:43.020
play less.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.020
I need to play more video games.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.020
I've been slacking.

01:45.020 --> 01:46.020
You need to play more variety of video games.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.840
I need to play more games that I've actually bought on Steam.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
There you go.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.840
I just bought Limbo, because it's on sale and it looks really neat.

01:53.840 --> 01:54.840
Who doesn't love a sale?

01:54.840 --> 01:59.240
I've been getting really kind of artsy fartsy games and then I went out and bought Dr. Robotnik's

01:59.240 --> 02:00.240
Mean Bean Machine.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
Why not?

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
So, more on that later.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.720
You mean Kirby's Avalanche?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.560
No, puyo puyo.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.560
Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.560
Hi.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.560
How are you, Loki?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.560
I'm doing alright.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
Yeah?

02:12.560 --> 02:13.560
Yeah.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.560
What's new with you?

02:14.560 --> 02:15.560
Not much.

02:15.560 --> 02:19.720
I mean, just watching a video of Grand Theft Auto.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.240
Even when you're not playing it, you're thinking about it.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.240
It's cool.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.720
Yeah, I am.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.520
I noticed that you brought pizza with you to the show tonight.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.960
The last OLR of 2012, by the way.

02:30.960 --> 02:34.480
Actually the last live VoG network show of 2012.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.600
Not the last VoG show of 2012, because we do have taped programming tomorrow, but the

02:38.600 --> 02:40.880
last live show of 2012 tonight.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.560
So you brought pizza and you said it's Pepperoni 4.0?

02:43.560 --> 02:47.220
They call it, it's Round Table's Pepperoni 4.0.

02:47.220 --> 02:51.640
It's not very good, because they're like, oh hey, we're gonna put a bunch of pepperoni

02:51.640 --> 02:52.640
on there.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.780
Yeah, I thought it'd be a lot of pepperoni, but it's just like, really the thing that

02:56.780 --> 02:58.420
ruins it is their primo pepperoni.

02:58.420 --> 03:02.420
It's the one that's like, it looks like salami, and it kind of tastes like salami.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.420
Maybe it is salami.

03:03.420 --> 03:09.780
It's not salami, but it tastes sort of, it's either saltier and spicier, and it just kind

03:09.780 --> 03:10.780
of tastes off.

03:10.780 --> 03:12.380
The rest of them taste pretty good.

03:12.380 --> 03:17.060
But they have like these, I don't know, it's almost like the full currency of pepperonis.

03:17.060 --> 03:22.260
They have the salami shaped pepperonis, they have the smaller, regular sized pepperonis,

03:22.260 --> 03:27.220
they have the pepperonis you would find at like, was it Papa Murphy's or whatever, or

03:27.220 --> 03:28.220
uh...

03:28.220 --> 03:32.540
Honestly, Loki, I look at that and I go, I want a veggie.

03:32.540 --> 03:36.380
And then they have tiny pepperonis that are like, the size of, I don't know what.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.860
It's just super tiny.

03:37.860 --> 03:42.740
We're always joined by the fourth guest on our show, the chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

03:42.740 --> 03:46.180
where we do tape live every Sunday night, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.740
But not tonight, he was off.

03:47.740 --> 03:50.940
He plays in the drum line for the Atlanta Falcons, and they had the late game today.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.800
So he was off tonight.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.820
But we do have the chatters with us tonight.

03:54.820 --> 04:00.820
Frisbee starts us off tonight on Loki's Pizza, saying it's pep for Roni.

04:00.820 --> 04:02.820
Alright.

04:02.820 --> 04:10.860
Well, we do have another guest with us tonight live in studio, a makeup visit, if you will.

04:10.860 --> 04:16.460
Say hello, everybody, to the VOG leaderboard, undoubtable winner for the whole damn year.

04:16.460 --> 04:19.760
I don't know, the month's not over yet, a lot can happen in a couple days, but for the

04:19.760 --> 04:20.860
whole year, I'm sure.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.620
Say hello, everybody, to Flaco Jones.

04:22.620 --> 04:23.620
Hi, everybody.

04:23.620 --> 04:24.620
Hi, Flaco.

04:24.620 --> 04:25.620
How are you?

04:25.620 --> 04:26.620
I'm doing great.

04:26.620 --> 04:27.620
Yeah?

04:27.620 --> 04:28.620
What's new?

04:28.620 --> 04:29.620
Tiger Claw has more points.

04:29.620 --> 04:33.420
If you just take points for the whole year, I'm pretty sure he's got the most points.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.420
Oh, really?

04:34.420 --> 04:35.420
Oh, then maybe.

04:35.420 --> 04:37.460
But a number of times on the leaderboard, then yes, that's me.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.540
Bobby has to figure all that shit out in the next couple days.

04:39.540 --> 04:45.420
I don't envy him for that, but nevertheless, a great showing on the VOG network leaderboards

04:45.420 --> 04:46.420
this year.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.780
So thanks for playing.

04:47.780 --> 04:49.260
Thank you.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.260
I'm the winner.

04:50.260 --> 04:51.260
Yes.

04:51.260 --> 04:54.420
So you get to come on the show tonight and just glow.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.420
That's my prize.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.660
A winner is you.

04:56.660 --> 04:57.660
Congratulations.

04:57.660 --> 05:01.700
Well, maybe we'll get like Tiger Claw to call in or somebody else to call in at the end

05:01.700 --> 05:03.380
of the show and do a little gloating.

05:03.380 --> 05:06.780
I want to hear from Immortal King too, because he's been neck and neck with you the past

05:06.780 --> 05:07.780
couple months.

05:07.780 --> 05:08.780
Yeah.

05:09.020 --> 05:10.260
He's got a point head start right at the beginning.

05:10.260 --> 05:13.380
Well, he's he figured out how to play the system.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.380
That's right.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.380
So good for him.

05:15.380 --> 05:18.660
He gets he gets I should give him a special piece of loot for that or something just to

05:18.660 --> 05:23.540
give him enough points to beat you like a bank, like a piggy bank banked all these podcast

05:23.540 --> 05:24.540
points from last month.

05:24.540 --> 05:25.540
Exactly.

05:25.540 --> 05:26.540
That'd be a great trophy.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.660
Well, welcome back to the show.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.260
For those that don't know, here's the deal.

05:30.260 --> 05:32.780
Flaco Jones joined us for a show earlier this year.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.020
I want to say it was around June, right?

05:34.020 --> 05:35.020
It was in May.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.020
It was in May.

05:36.020 --> 05:37.020
Yeah.

05:37.020 --> 05:38.020
Close enough.

05:38.260 --> 05:39.260
Back in May.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.860
And we were doing the show and we got to the classic game of the week, which is always

05:41.860 --> 05:44.640
right at the end of part A. Right.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.460
And that's right when the power went out.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.660
Oh, right in the middle of me talking.

05:48.660 --> 05:53.380
That is a killer for the show, because what happens is then then we lose the recorded

05:53.380 --> 05:54.380
archive.

05:54.380 --> 05:55.380
And so there was no podcast that week.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.980
So it ended up being a live only show.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.980
And we kept saying after that, we got to get Flaco back.

05:58.980 --> 05:59.980
We got to get Flaco back.

05:59.980 --> 06:00.980
Flaco's back.

06:00.980 --> 06:01.980
Yeah, I'm back.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.500
Well, the problem was I moved in June.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.660
I moved away from Sacramento.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.460
So I live like an hour away now.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.180
So that was what made it so hard to get back.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.100
You drove an hour all the way just to be here tonight.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.820
Well, I had really good traffic, so I actually drove like 45 minutes.

06:15.820 --> 06:16.820
Maybe you sped a little bit.

06:16.820 --> 06:17.820
A little bit.

06:17.820 --> 06:18.820
But nobody got me.

06:18.820 --> 06:19.820
All right.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.820
So I want to talk to you a little bit about like you and the types of games you play and

06:21.820 --> 06:23.900
all that stuff.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.220
What kind of video games are you into?

06:25.220 --> 06:26.580
What kind of gamer are you?

06:26.580 --> 06:27.580
Console gamer?

06:27.580 --> 06:28.580
PC gamer?

06:28.580 --> 06:29.580
MMO player?

06:29.580 --> 06:30.580
I'm a console gamer.

06:30.580 --> 06:35.180
I mean, I do play some stuff on PC and I do like WoW a lot, but I still consider myself

06:35.180 --> 06:36.180
mainly a console gamer.

06:36.700 --> 06:42.100
Those are the games I prefer and I tend to like games that have a really good story.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.060
Gameplay still got to be good, but if the story is good enough, if it's really, really

06:45.060 --> 06:51.060
good, I can kind of sometimes forego some gameplay elements and I just go for story

06:51.060 --> 06:55.180
games because I went to film school to be a screenwriter and so I'm all sucked up in

06:55.180 --> 06:58.660
the story and I love games like Bioshock and I love RPGs because they always have really

06:58.660 --> 07:00.340
good, really deep story.

07:00.340 --> 07:05.060
So you must be really into Walking Dead these days because that's a game that's got to go.

07:05.060 --> 07:09.340
I finally, we'll get into gaming weeks later, but I finally got exposed to Walking Dead

07:09.340 --> 07:11.860
this past week and very well written game.

07:11.860 --> 07:12.860
Yeah, yeah.

07:12.860 --> 07:13.860
I was waiting on that.

07:13.860 --> 07:15.460
I bought that one just a couple weeks ago.

07:15.460 --> 07:18.820
I was waiting until it all had come out and I heard they did a good job.

07:18.820 --> 07:21.940
I want to make sure they did a good job before I bought it because that started coming out

07:21.940 --> 07:26.180
I think in April or something and I wasn't willing to just buy that now and then hope

07:26.180 --> 07:29.100
that the rest would come out and still be good or anything like that.

07:29.100 --> 07:33.420
So I waited until the whole thing came out and I bought the season pass even though the

07:33.420 --> 07:36.740
season's over, but they still gave it the $5 off, you know, one of the games.

07:36.740 --> 07:40.620
Well, there was a great sale on Xbox this week where all the, you know, they were given

07:40.620 --> 07:44.620
away episode one for free and then all the episodes like two days ago, two through five

07:44.620 --> 07:45.820
were only 200 points each.

07:45.820 --> 07:48.460
So you can get the whole thing for like 10 bucks.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.180
So I was like, yoink, thank you.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.380
I'll be taking care of that.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.420
So I had to play $20.

07:53.420 --> 07:58.780
I have to play episodes two through five still at some point, but you know, that's all right.

07:58.780 --> 08:00.940
Telltale has done a lot of great stuff the past couple of years.

08:00.940 --> 08:05.180
I mean, they're only game that was kind of, and was Jurassic park, but a lot of the, I

08:05.180 --> 08:09.580
mean, even then, I mean, I haven't played it, so I'm really going off of what I hear

08:09.580 --> 08:12.900
on the internet, but even then Jurassic park has its people that are like, it's not as

08:12.900 --> 08:14.300
bad as you guys make it out to be.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.300
Thanks, Rob.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.300
Now that song is stuck in my head again.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.180
Jurassic park is frightened.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.180
Yeah.

08:19.180 --> 08:23.300
Or the actual theme song, Jurassic park, the weird Al one or whatever.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.300
All right.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.700
Um, let's see what else you used to work in the video game industry, right?

08:27.700 --> 08:28.700
Yeah.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.700
I was a video game tester.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.260
You were the tester.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.260
I was the tester.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.660
Oh, wait, no, not, not actually didn't know.

08:34.660 --> 08:35.660
I did.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.320
I did a play test for Sony as well.

08:37.320 --> 08:42.300
They had us come in and do a play test for, Oh gosh, I can't remember the game now.

08:42.300 --> 08:47.220
It was like maybe one of the Jack and Daxter games, like a multiplayer play test and that's

08:47.220 --> 08:48.220
kind of what got me into it.

08:48.220 --> 08:51.460
They put a Craigslist, Craigslist posting was like, come and do this play test.

08:51.460 --> 08:56.060
We'll pay you 80 bucks and you get to just play the game multiplayer and it was more

08:56.060 --> 08:58.420
of like a focus group testing thing.

08:58.420 --> 09:00.220
And I did that and I was like, that was really fun.

09:00.220 --> 09:05.340
So I started looking up a video game testing job opportunities and I found Konami and I

09:05.340 --> 09:08.580
went and interviewed and I thought I did a horrible interview and I went home and they

09:08.580 --> 09:11.580
called me back and said, you got the job.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.660
Well seeing how Konami has been doing the past couple of years.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.940
No, but this was just a while ago.

09:14.940 --> 09:17.740
This is when Konami was doing a lot of really quality stuff, right?

09:17.740 --> 09:21.900
Well, they were still, I mean, they still had metal gear stuff, but the stuff I, you

09:21.900 --> 09:25.660
know, you were there during the period of a lot of, and this is all common knowledge

09:25.660 --> 09:26.660
at this point.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.660
I don't think there's any secrets anymore.

09:27.660 --> 09:30.260
You were in the office that is since closed, right?

09:30.260 --> 09:31.260
Redwood Shores, I believe.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.700
But you were out of there before that happened, right?

09:33.700 --> 09:36.640
Just before they moved to LA, but everyone knew they were leaving.

09:36.640 --> 09:41.220
But like, you know, you were there when Shane was there and like Mel B was there and a lot

09:41.220 --> 09:47.120
of the people that did the Xbox DDR, uh, series, the ultra mix that did a lot of the step programming

09:47.120 --> 09:48.120
and testing and so forth for that.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.100
But you were really involved with the DDR stuff.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.300
No, I didn't do DDR stuff.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.300
I did.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.620
I did a lot of karaoke revolution and Frogger was the first game I worked on.

09:56.620 --> 10:02.020
It was like the Frogger DS game and there was like a Frogger, screw you, screw you for

10:02.020 --> 10:03.020
all of that.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.620
You should have told him this sucks.

10:04.620 --> 10:05.620
Don't put it on.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.620
Just let it die.

10:06.620 --> 10:07.620
Let it die.

10:07.620 --> 10:11.580
You know, I prefer to work on those games other than what they started cranking out

10:11.580 --> 10:15.100
while I was there, which were really crappy licensed games where they would get licensed

10:15.100 --> 10:17.740
off of Saturday morning cartoons and do that.

10:17.740 --> 10:25.340
And I was like the head man for some reason because I took it with such a gosh, such enthusiasm.

10:25.340 --> 10:28.100
I became the winks club guy.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.580
It was a very small game, so they only needed like one or two people to work on it at a

10:31.580 --> 10:32.580
time.

10:32.580 --> 10:36.140
So I was the, the expert in all things winks and I, I took it and I was like, I'm going

10:36.140 --> 10:37.140
to roll with this.

10:37.140 --> 10:42.300
I watched, I watched the first season of the show and I was writing up bugs about continuity

10:42.300 --> 10:43.300
problems.

10:43.300 --> 10:49.020
It's like, Oh no, she wouldn't say that before she went on her first date with sky because

10:49.020 --> 10:50.020
you know what though?

10:50.020 --> 10:51.020
Here's the thing.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.260
As much as I want to sit here and make fun of you.

10:52.260 --> 10:56.220
How ironic is it now though that like my little pony is the coolest show on TV.

10:56.220 --> 11:02.380
So like you were like hipster, you're watching little girl TV shows before it was cool and

11:02.380 --> 11:03.940
you weren't even smoking weed.

11:03.940 --> 11:04.940
Right?

11:04.940 --> 11:05.940
Yeah.

11:05.940 --> 11:06.940
Except my little pony still isn't cool.

11:06.940 --> 11:08.820
It was only cool in the eighties.

11:08.820 --> 11:11.860
You can address those cards and letters to dark soccer.

11:11.860 --> 11:15.580
I have kids now and I was watching Nickelodeon the other day and the winks club is on Nickelodeon

11:15.580 --> 11:19.740
now and it's all computer and it looks weird and the voices are all different.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.100
There was a British chick on that show and now she's not British.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.740
She's just another purple haired girl.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.660
And now they have another winks game.

11:26.660 --> 11:27.660
I'm there.

11:27.660 --> 11:28.660
Is it another Konami winks game?

11:28.660 --> 11:29.660
No, it's not Konami anymore.

11:29.660 --> 11:30.660
It's d three.

11:30.660 --> 11:32.220
Oh, Konami lost the license.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.220
Sorry guys.

11:33.220 --> 11:38.820
Ironically though, ironically though, the guy that was my Konami rep at the time who

11:38.820 --> 11:43.460
was selling the winks game is now working for d three selling the winks game.

11:43.460 --> 11:44.460
This is hilarious.

11:44.460 --> 11:45.460
Oh God.

11:45.460 --> 11:49.900
That's, that's even worse than like Flaco is like Flaco just kind of got assigned to

11:49.900 --> 11:50.900
it yet.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.660
This guy has like been following it, right?

11:52.660 --> 11:56.900
Well for him, he said it was, it was all right cause he's all, we've sold these in the past.

11:56.900 --> 11:57.900
He's all I know.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.380
I know about this franchise cause I had to sell it before.

12:00.380 --> 12:03.820
So Konami made a lot of winks games.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.100
I assume they were selling.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.060
That's kind of like one of the guys I worked under over there.

12:08.060 --> 12:12.300
He was like, you know, it's kind of a, that's, that's where the industry, or at least where

12:12.300 --> 12:18.820
Konami was going was like, why put a bunch of money into a new IP that might not sell

12:18.820 --> 12:23.140
if you can just buy a license and the parents are going to walk in, dig well, toys or us

12:23.140 --> 12:24.700
and buy that game for their kid.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.700
Cause like, Oh my kid watches that show.

12:25.700 --> 12:26.700
I'll just buy it.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.700
And they don't even care about the game.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.100
That's a lot of what kind of goes on in the industry.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.100
Heck yeah.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.940
I mean it's for better or for worse.

12:31.940 --> 12:32.940
I mean, yeah.

12:32.940 --> 12:37.900
You know, the walking dead again, terrific game that happens to be based on a license.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.300
It worked in that scenario, although I want to say, isn't there like a first person shooter

12:41.300 --> 12:44.700
game as well, but it's like, there's one activisions put one out, but let me say it's not out yet.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.820
The bar, not very high for that one.

12:46.820 --> 12:48.340
And I'm worried that people are going to get confused.

12:48.340 --> 12:51.860
The walking dead game from tell tales based on the comic.

12:51.860 --> 12:55.520
The first procedure is going to be based on the show, which is based on the comic.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.740
So it's like, it kind of dilutes itself a little bit.

12:57.740 --> 13:08.260
So let me ask you something, Jim, does, do songs like this give you PTSD?

13:08.260 --> 13:11.460
That was, I feel worse.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.460
Of course.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.460
Well, you know, I didn't hear that.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.460
I didn't hear that.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.140
I didn't catch the beginning when I was watching Nickelodeon, but I feel worse for the people

13:17.140 --> 13:22.060
that worked at E3 and I had to work right next to the Winx booth because that song played

13:22.060 --> 13:23.060
on a loop all the time.

13:23.060 --> 13:27.780
At least when I did E3, I had to do, I got to showcase Pro Evolution, whatever it's called

13:27.780 --> 13:32.660
soccer, a manly soccer, winning 11, 11 at the time, but I think they were dropping the

13:32.660 --> 13:36.460
winning 11 title cause it sounded really stupid with 11 behind it.

13:36.460 --> 13:42.300
But yeah, that song played on a loop like crazy change in chat, uh, saying, Jim, remember

13:42.300 --> 13:45.380
when we worked on the PS2 PC one, that wasn't so bad to play.

13:45.380 --> 13:46.420
No, I have that game.

13:46.420 --> 13:47.660
I still have that.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.300
I got, uh, are you going to show your kids someday?

13:50.300 --> 13:51.300
I will.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.720
You know, I, I have it on, I have a little emulator on my phone and I have the Game Boy

13:54.720 --> 13:59.300
version on that and I've showed my kids that, that version.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.520
And uh, even my son doesn't, doesn't mind it.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.520
He likes it.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.700
You press, if you press and hold the X button, Bloom charges up her flame attack and it shoots

14:06.700 --> 14:08.620
out and it's like a pretty animation.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.740
So my son likes that.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.540
But yeah, I have the PC version.

14:11.540 --> 14:15.220
I think I tried to show it to a bunch of friends and they were like, this is horrible.

14:15.220 --> 14:18.780
But the PC version actually, out of all the games we played, that was the best one at

14:18.780 --> 14:19.780
all the winks games.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.620
It was the most like a game.

14:21.620 --> 14:25.300
And then later on they just started making mini game collections with that were horrible.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.300
Hmm.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.300
Yeah, really bad.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.340
But the first couple of games, they actually tried to make real games and then like, Oh,

14:30.340 --> 14:31.340
we don't need to do that.

14:31.340 --> 14:32.420
Let's, let's save even more money.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.940
Just make mini games.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.140
All right.

14:36.140 --> 14:39.640
I guess some of our live was that you, you carry a curse with you apparently Flaco because

14:39.640 --> 14:42.180
you know you shut off the power that one time.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.580
Apparently some of our live listeners are getting dropped right now.

14:44.580 --> 14:45.580
I don't know what's up.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.580
But that hasn't happened for a while.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.340
It hasn't happened ever since we got the new router at home.

14:48.340 --> 14:50.260
So turn off your porn horns, everybody.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.100
Um, it's cause I brought two mobile devices.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.660
Well, also I want to point out, we're showing, I'm showing that the feed is still going and

14:55.660 --> 15:00.100
we haven't had, usually if we have a big drop, I see it, it goes disconnect, dah, dah, dah,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.100
dah.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.380
And like, but we're, we're okay for right now.

15:02.380 --> 15:03.380
So we'll see.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.380
All right.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.380
Um, anyhow.

15:05.380 --> 15:08.860
Oh, now there it goes.

15:08.860 --> 15:10.700
There's the reconnect.

15:10.700 --> 15:11.700
Good times.

15:11.700 --> 15:12.700
Live radio.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.700
What can you do?

15:13.980 --> 15:16.500
We are going to press forward best we can.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.660
So no one ever gets to hear me tell my story, but no, you only have it on the podcast.

15:20.660 --> 15:21.660
No, that's good.

15:21.660 --> 15:22.660
Damn you.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.660
Konami.

15:23.660 --> 15:24.660
I think they're the ones shutting me down.

15:24.660 --> 15:25.660
Like, Oh, he's talking about the wings.

15:25.660 --> 15:26.660
Turn it off.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.660
Turn it off.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.660
Do you think they're DDoSing us right now?

15:29.660 --> 15:30.660
Yes.

15:30.660 --> 15:31.660
All right.

15:31.660 --> 15:38.200
Let me tell the chatters to calm down and twist your panties, everybody.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
The world is fine.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
All right.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.960
Anyhow, barring a power outage, which you never know might happen.

15:43.960 --> 15:44.960
All right.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.040
Um, so you did the testing stuff for a while.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.440
You did the wing, she and Frogger.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.440
You didn't do DDR, but okay.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.760
You did some of this cool stuff, a little metal gear, but you, you don't do game industry

15:52.760 --> 15:53.760
stuff anymore.

15:53.760 --> 15:54.760
Right?

15:54.760 --> 15:55.760
No, no.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.760
I got, I got out of that and when I graduated film school and, but instead of running to

15:59.760 --> 16:05.660
Hollywood and doing that, I, I met a girl and I moved to Sacramento and, and I got an

16:05.660 --> 16:09.360
awesome job at a school up here and I'm doing TV stuff, which is, which is great.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.880
And it's so much better than the, Oh my gosh, I hope I survive plan that I thought I was

16:13.880 --> 16:14.880
going to have college.

16:14.880 --> 16:19.180
Like, let's go to Hollywood and try not to get killed and make movies.

16:19.180 --> 16:22.640
And in this whole very interesting, it's a small world type of thing.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.880
You married extra verse sister from Hoard House.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.880
Extra from Hoard House.

16:25.880 --> 16:26.880
I married.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.960
So he's my brother-in-law, the guy who comes on here and talks about, you know, all sorts

16:30.960 --> 16:32.000
of nasty stuff.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
That's awesome though.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Bleached assholes.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yes.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
There we go.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.340
Who doesn't do any of that, like in real life around like, especially like family

16:39.340 --> 16:40.340
Oh no.

16:40.340 --> 16:41.340
Yeah.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.340
Yeah.

16:42.340 --> 16:43.340
Never.

16:43.340 --> 16:44.340
Never.

16:44.340 --> 16:45.340
That's why he gets it out.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.780
He has Tourette's, but it only takes place when he's doing a podcast.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.100
Well, that's not, that's not true.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.600
Usually when he's hanging out with friends too, but, uh, or when he's at a theme park

16:52.600 --> 16:54.060
on a roller coaster.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.060
Yeah.

16:55.060 --> 16:58.260
So, so the game testing stuff for you was just kind of like a bridge from one thing

16:58.260 --> 16:59.260
to another, right?

16:59.260 --> 17:00.940
It was a college job really.

17:00.940 --> 17:05.420
I was not the kind of guy who could go to school and not work because I had to pay for

17:05.420 --> 17:06.420
my rent and everything.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.720
I didn't have a ton of financial aid.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.240
So I had to have a full time job.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.240
So it was crazy.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.280
Cause I lived in, well, it's kind of confusing to say this to people who don't know, but

17:14.280 --> 17:19.400
I lived in Concord and I worked in Redwood city and I went to school in San Francisco

17:19.400 --> 17:24.320
side on Thursdays, especially I do this like triangle of doom where I took, where I took

17:24.320 --> 17:28.120
Bart to Caltrain and went all the way down to Redwood city.

17:28.120 --> 17:31.200
It was like hours on, on commuting just to go back and forth.

17:31.200 --> 17:36.520
I wouldn't, I'd leave the house at like six in the morning and get home at, at 11 o'clock

17:36.520 --> 17:37.520
at night.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.520
I had to do that to make ends meet.

17:38.520 --> 17:42.520
It sounds like Konami worked out a lot better for you than like Burger King, which some

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
people have to do, right?

17:43.520 --> 17:46.160
Oh, I used to move TVs for the good guys and that was horrible.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.920
I hurt my back a couple of times and Konami paid better and I just got to sit on my butt

17:49.920 --> 17:50.920
and play video games.

17:50.920 --> 17:51.920
Gotcha.

17:51.920 --> 17:52.920
All right.

17:52.920 --> 17:55.920
Well, people do what they got to do.

17:55.920 --> 18:01.220
Let me ask this, what, what kind of like, are there any like really funny stories about

18:01.220 --> 18:05.240
like what might've happened, like going into your favorite game, like, like crazy testing

18:05.240 --> 18:09.120
behind the scenes story, like, you know, not safe for work type things.

18:09.120 --> 18:14.120
Gosh, I don't want to like throw anybody in the bus.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.060
Don't say their name.

18:16.060 --> 18:22.160
Some people, you know, if, unless it was Shane, that might all mean say his name.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.580
We would, we would, it was, it was a nice, relaxed like workplace.

18:25.580 --> 18:29.500
It wasn't, I heard Sony was like a, was like a sweat shop, but I don't know, I didn't really

18:29.500 --> 18:32.960
work there, but I heard it was like a sweat shop and it wasn't fun, but we would go out

18:32.960 --> 18:38.400
on lunch and we'd get some drinks and we'd come back and it's like, oh, it's post-lunch

18:38.400 --> 18:44.720
nap time and look at all these DDR pads make wonderful blankets and you know, just stuff

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
like that.

18:45.720 --> 18:49.240
But you know, I'm drinking with my boss, I guess that sounds bad.

18:49.240 --> 18:53.160
So they're drinking then like, well, it's not bad if I drink on the job kind of or at

18:53.160 --> 18:54.320
lunch break.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.980
So yeah, we would come back and, but we, we always got our work done.

18:57.980 --> 18:58.980
That's all that matters, right?

18:58.980 --> 19:02.040
And some jobs allow you to drink technically on the job, like especially if you are the

19:02.040 --> 19:03.880
type of person that entertains clients.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.880
Yeah.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.800
Well, I assume it wasn't like a prostitute.

19:07.800 --> 19:12.440
I just assume because my superiors do it, that it wasn't against Konami's rules, so

19:12.440 --> 19:16.920
I was going to be blissfully, you know, technically we're all temps anyway, so.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.360
Were there any girls?

19:18.360 --> 19:19.360
There were a couple of girls.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.360
Yeah, yeah.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.360
That's good.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.160
Some of them I still, I still, I still know like Facebook friends with and Twitter friends

19:24.160 --> 19:25.280
and whatnot.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.920
Was it kind of a fraternity environment?

19:26.920 --> 19:28.320
That's what I hear about some testing things.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.680
I mean, even though it was, there were girls too, you know, they're, they're, they're just

19:31.720 --> 19:32.720
some of the bros too.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.720
Right.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.720
Yeah.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.720
I guess a little bit.

19:35.720 --> 19:36.720
It wasn't, I don't think it was too crazy there.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.040
Like, I don't know, maybe I hung out with the wrong crowd, but you know, I had friends

19:40.040 --> 19:43.640
who were girls, friends who were gay, and it didn't seem like it was too much of like

19:43.640 --> 19:44.640
a frat house.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.140
Well, I don't mean necessarily like, I didn't know if it was like that company you talked

19:48.140 --> 19:50.800
about a couple of weeks ago where they had strippers at their holiday party.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.800
It wasn't like that.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.520
That's a holiday party.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
That's for the best.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
I don't know.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.520
I mean, I don't know.

19:57.520 --> 20:01.240
I mean, it was definitely like a fun like place to work, but it wasn't a total, like,

20:01.280 --> 20:04.280
I mean, yeah, it was, it was a lot of guys there, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like

20:04.280 --> 20:06.280
that Adam Sandler mama's boy movie.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.280
We weren't all like that.

20:07.280 --> 20:11.120
I just want to say you told me a story one time and I don't remember if it was on the

20:11.120 --> 20:12.120
show or not on the show.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.120
Maybe this was even you about some guy who came to work with no pants on or something.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.480
Oh, that was not me.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.480
So I don't know.

20:17.480 --> 20:21.520
We did have a guy who come to work and I had a friend who worked there and he noticed this

20:21.520 --> 20:24.060
and he had to tell me, he's like, we had a guy who came to work.

20:24.060 --> 20:27.800
He wore like just a white undershirt basically for a shirt.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.600
My friend would tap me on the shoulder.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.020
He's like, I hate it when he wears that shirt cause all I can stare at are his big, dark

20:34.020 --> 20:37.880
Asian nipples.

20:37.880 --> 20:47.040
I wish you would put a darker shirt on cause I hate staring at his big, dark Asian nipples.

20:47.040 --> 20:50.360
So yeah, but I don't know about anyone who came to work without any pants on.

20:50.360 --> 20:54.320
See, once again, I was probably not hanging out with the right crowd.

20:54.320 --> 20:59.760
Shane is yelling out in chat who it was, but since I don't want to, I got to be careful.

20:59.760 --> 21:00.760
Are you in the chat room?

21:00.760 --> 21:01.760
Okay.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.760
Yeah, I am now.

21:02.760 --> 21:03.760
I guess I wasn't.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.760
Okay.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.760
Oh, he was the one.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.760
See, I missed that one.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.320
I must not have been there.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.920
I got laid off for a couple months too.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.480
Shane that told me that story.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.480
Oops.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.480
All right.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.000
You have a question from the chatters and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and all

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
that.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.680
Tiger Claw asks, during your time as a tester, did the company make you do some testing that

21:20.680 --> 21:21.680
was out of the ordinary?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.640
I'm not sure how to take that question.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.680
You know what, one thing that they asked me to do that was kind of cool actually was I

21:27.680 --> 21:34.120
got to take a, a dev kit home because we had to test Metal Gear online and they wanted

21:34.120 --> 21:37.600
to test it with different people's different service providers and stuff like that.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
And so it was a big deal.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.600
I signed a bunch of paperwork.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.600
Maybe I shouldn't talk about it, but whatever.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.520
I signed a bunch of paperwork and take the system home and actually got to test Metal

21:45.520 --> 21:50.760
Gear 3 online from home and that was really fun and like no one's supposed to be there.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.760
Of course, my roommate was right there.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.880
He's like, Oh, this is awesome.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.880
Like quiet.

21:53.880 --> 21:54.880
Yeah.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.880
Exactly.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.480
We get on a conference call and we would all talk and then we were playing with the Japanese

21:59.480 --> 22:00.480
play testers too.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.880
And they were like just murdering us cause they'd already gotten to test the game.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.280
We were just testing online functionality really.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.120
They'd already tested it over in Japan.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.360
We didn't get the triple A titles in Redwood City.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.000
Usually it was those like Metal Gear stuff that was done in Japan.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
That's not so secretive.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
That's not that bad.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.760
At the time they, you know, people want to know everything about a game like that and

22:17.760 --> 22:18.760
yeah, you gotta be careful.

22:18.760 --> 22:22.960
I don't remember ever being like told to test something like in some weird way.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
I don't know.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.960
But yeah, it was just, just taking it home.

22:24.960 --> 22:25.960
That was kind of cool.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.600
But it was, I didn't expect to ever have to be able to do testing at home.

22:28.600 --> 22:32.280
Raginator says paternity testing would be testing is out of the ordinary.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.280
He's not on the Maury show.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.280
Raginator.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.280
Yeah.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.280
I didn't have to do any of that.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.980
I'm trying to think cause the only one story that always sticks out with me is just because

22:39.980 --> 22:44.680
the game was so terrible was that 25 to life and how like, you know, bad that game was

22:44.680 --> 22:45.680
or whatever.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.920
And you were telling me, Oh my gosh, that's right.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
Crime life.

22:48.920 --> 22:49.920
I think it was crime life.

22:49.920 --> 22:50.920
I'm sorry.

22:50.920 --> 22:51.920
Yeah, that was a game.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.600
I didn't test it, but in the downtime when I didn't get laid off the next time there

22:54.600 --> 22:58.500
was downtime, they, they kind of have you just test games that are already out and really

22:58.500 --> 23:02.960
buggy or they just, they just have old builds of and so to keep our skills, you know, kind

23:02.960 --> 23:03.960
of tight.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.760
And they would, they, so crime life was a game where if it was, it was a grand theft

23:07.760 --> 23:11.800
out of rip off I guess, but you could throw like every box into this one room and then

23:11.800 --> 23:15.280
trigger a cut scene and the guys are like, they get stuck trying to walk through like

23:15.280 --> 23:16.280
a million boxes.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.360
So we, we bug that game and that game was so bad.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.360
Like I don't think it was ever released.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.360
I think it was just released in Europe.

23:21.360 --> 23:26.400
Uh, no, it came out of an Xbox Xbox, but yeah, it was very, I don't know anything about that

23:26.400 --> 23:27.400
game.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
I just know it was terrible.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.380
You know, despite all these, you know, extreme stories we're telling and so forth, you seem

23:31.380 --> 23:33.760
very like positive and happy about the whole experience.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.520
Would you say that, you know, you had a good experience and doing that whole thing and

23:37.520 --> 23:39.360
yeah, that was one of my favorite jobs I've ever had.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.800
Like the favorite, my favorite, I guess odd job that I've ever had.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.400
Like we like that I had to go through to get myself through college.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.360
It was the bad and I worked there for like two years because a lot of people are always

23:48.360 --> 23:49.360
like, Oh, game testing.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.520
You have to, you have to play the same game for eight hours a day and it's not all the

23:52.520 --> 23:53.520
glamour you think.

23:53.520 --> 23:58.300
Well, I think like game testing wire, like, you know, it's like a similar, not really

23:58.300 --> 24:02.440
a first job or, but a very early job, not like something like I wouldn't go right now.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.640
Hey, I'm going to become a game tester to pay my way through my mortgage and stuff.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.640
That's not going to happen.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.640
It's just stupid.

24:08.640 --> 24:13.240
However, my friend pays his bills by being a video game, a strategy guide writer.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.760
Hey, yeah, whatever it is.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.120
They wrote the one for Mass Effect three.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.840
He says he can't play that game anymore.

24:18.840 --> 24:23.560
So yeah, there's a lot, there's a lot of like playing the same game, but it's just how you

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
deal with that.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.600
And if you just have fun with it, like I, like I said, I had fun with the winks.

24:27.600 --> 24:32.080
I was put on this game that you had a positive attitude about, like I get to be lead tester

24:32.080 --> 24:33.240
even if it's the winks.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.240
I don't care.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.240
Yeah.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.080
If you don't have a positive attitude, then yeah, that job could be horrible because you

24:37.080 --> 24:40.920
could just be like, Oh, I'm playing Frogger and this is something I had to do in Frogger

24:40.920 --> 24:41.920
that was kind of annoying.

24:41.920 --> 24:46.000
And maybe this goes back to that question Tigerclaw had was they're like, we're, we

24:46.000 --> 24:52.680
have all this time to test still now use the jump on every tile in the game.

24:52.680 --> 24:57.520
So every square, like every tiny little piece that you could jump on, just jump on it and

24:57.520 --> 24:59.020
see if you don't fall through the world.

24:59.020 --> 25:02.040
And it was so annoying because it wasn't just stuff you would normally go through.

25:02.040 --> 25:05.760
It was like, Oh, now use this cheat code to fly over the water and make sure that you

25:05.760 --> 25:06.760
die in the water.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.680
It's like, but over there I can't get there anyway.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
What's the point?

25:09.680 --> 25:10.800
So it was like, why am I?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.280
So that, that got annoying after a while.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.240
I was like, okay, I think we've tested this game enough.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.000
Please get me out Frogger Frogger Frogger as hell.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.560
And that was the first game I was on.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.560
So it was like, is this what this job is going to be?

25:20.560 --> 25:24.680
But that's a good little life lesson is that, uh, you know, if you have a positive attitude,

25:24.680 --> 25:25.920
you can achieve anything.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.920
That's right.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.920
Leaving your dream.

25:27.920 --> 25:28.920
The more you know.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
All right.

25:29.920 --> 25:34.640
Well, thank you for giving us a little bit of the 10 year old behind the scenes dirt.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.640
We appreciate it.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.640
Yeah.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.920
But, um, so now you're, now you're doing other stuff.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.920
You're doing stuff that's a little more with the film stuff.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.920
Yeah.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.920
Yeah.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.360
Education and you know, video telecourses, ITV classes, things like that.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.500
It's, it's pretty fun.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.080
And I know your wife is a teacher too, so you kind of, you know, you're, you're like

25:49.080 --> 25:50.080
a whole little teaching.

25:50.080 --> 25:54.280
We all work in like education and her, uh, her oldest brother does as well.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.280
He's a teacher.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.280
Her parents were teachers.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.360
It's a very education based family.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.560
So when I got to work at a school, I'm like, oh, this is cool.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.560
Yeah.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.000
I get to hear all their war stories and now I have some of my own though.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.280
I'm not a teacher, but still I, I interact with faculty and students and stuff.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.280
It's pretty cool.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.280
Very cool.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.280
Very cool.

26:09.320 --> 26:14.120
You know, stay a while and comment on the news with us and when we get into the second

26:14.120 --> 26:17.000
half of the show tonight, we're going to talk a lot about the best and worst of the year.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.320
So you'll definitely be talking along with us there.

26:20.320 --> 26:24.400
And at the end of the show tonight, we're going to let you finally make up the segment

26:24.400 --> 26:28.040
that was forever lost with your classic game of the week because Jamie wasn't here that

26:28.040 --> 26:29.040
week.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.040
So we let you do the classic game of the week.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.680
So she has her own game this week, but we're going to let you do your makeup at the end.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.300
So you, your teacher, you're familiar, or you're not a teacher yourself, you're in education.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.520
You're familiar with makeup work.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.560
Yeah.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.560
This is like your makeup assignment.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
So I still have my notes.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
There you go.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
Well done.

26:43.560 --> 26:48.560
So I got made fun of last time I brought a binder, like notebook style line paper instead

26:48.560 --> 26:49.560
of a computer.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
You're ready to go.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.560
You're more prepared than any of us.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.560
I love it.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.560
All right.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.120
I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.840
Act Def says teaching is cool if you have the patience.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.840
Yeah.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.040
You know, it's funny.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.080
I'm kind of a teacher too, but I'm a corporate trainer.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.200
It's technically my title.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.760
So, you know, a little different.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.760
Okay.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.720
We've got another question for Flaco, so why not?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.920
Another question, did you ever find a bug in a game you tested that was never fixed

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
upon release?

27:13.920 --> 27:16.280
I actually have an answer for this and it was a Winx game.

27:16.280 --> 27:20.480
And this is like, it was, hurry up and go download it, Tiger Claw.

27:20.480 --> 27:21.480
Yeah.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.480
Game Boy Advance game.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.500
And it was towards the end of the game and it's a really horrible bug and it was very

27:25.500 --> 27:26.500
hard to reproduce.

27:26.500 --> 27:31.880
It took me, I did try to reproduce like a hundred times and I got it like, first I was

27:31.880 --> 27:34.040
getting like one time at every 50 I'd get it.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.640
And then I got it to like one out of a hundred.

27:35.640 --> 27:39.200
Then I tested it a hundred more times after they said they fixed it and it didn't happen

27:39.200 --> 27:40.200
anymore.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.680
And it was a game breaking bug where if you saved your game and then you walked into a

27:44.680 --> 27:47.920
certain part of a wall, you'd walk through the wall and it would break the game and you

27:47.920 --> 27:52.720
would never be able to, since you saved your game, you wouldn't be able to restart it.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.920
You would pretty much a game killing game at the end.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.280
You have to start all the way over from the beginning.

27:57.280 --> 28:01.080
And they sound, they thought they'd fixed it, but then a customer service got a call

28:01.080 --> 28:05.240
about it, you know, when after the aim and release and this little girl was trying to

28:05.240 --> 28:08.140
play the game and it happened to her and she was stuck.

28:08.140 --> 28:11.320
And I was like, the customer service person came and asked like, is there any way out

28:11.320 --> 28:12.320
of this?

28:12.320 --> 28:13.320
And I was like, there isn't.

28:13.320 --> 28:17.480
That is a, that is a game killing bug and I thought so bad little girl, but it must

28:17.480 --> 28:21.620
have been like an insane chance cause it's very rare they have you test like a test something

28:21.620 --> 28:25.780
like a hundred times, but that it was such a big bug that I tried to do it and if I couldn't

28:25.780 --> 28:29.320
get it to happen one out of a hundred, then they're like, okay, then we'll, we'll release

28:29.320 --> 28:30.320
it.

28:30.560 --> 28:35.280
You tried, but because you didn't try hard enough, some little girl's winks dreams were

28:35.280 --> 28:36.280
shattered.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.840
I need to try 500 times.

28:37.840 --> 28:43.800
She threw that game boy advance at the TV, at the dog, and the lives were altered.

28:43.800 --> 28:47.080
If you restarted from that save point, it would still, you would still be bugged and

28:47.080 --> 28:50.040
you couldn't complete the game cause a door wouldn't open for you cause you could just

28:50.040 --> 28:52.240
walk right through it and then it wouldn't trigger the rest of the level.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.640
It's not the first game to have some of that.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.160
Zelda or some shit had that too.

28:55.160 --> 28:59.200
Remember they had to put out that fix on the Wii, the Zelda patch channel.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.200
Bubble Bubble.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.200
Yeah.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.720
No boss on level 30 and Bubble Bubble, you know, there's, there's worse things that have

29:04.720 --> 29:05.720
happened.

29:05.720 --> 29:06.720
The card fighters ones.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.720
All right.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.720
Uh, we're going to get into the news and all that good stuff.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.160
We just wanted to say there was no show last week.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.040
Sorry about it, but you know, it was the holidays.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.520
I think a lot of your favorite podcast didn't end up doing a show.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.160
We had a lot of stuff going on.

29:19.160 --> 29:26.920
So, um, also, uh, we hope you guys had a safe holiday and um, also a happy new year and

29:26.920 --> 29:27.920
all that good stuff.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.640
Cause we, we won't be doing another show until it is 2013 so we want to wish you all a happy

29:31.640 --> 29:33.960
new year and a safe new year.

29:33.960 --> 29:38.040
Remember guys, if you're going to drink and drive plan in advance, what is going to be

29:38.040 --> 29:39.400
your way to get home safely?

29:39.400 --> 29:40.580
Do not drink and drive.

29:40.580 --> 29:45.600
Get somebody sober, stay at, get a hotel, get a taxi, whatever you got to do.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.600
All right.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.640
Um, let's get into how our gaming weeks were.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.760
I know I had a very busy gaming week, but let's start with a dark soccer.

29:51.760 --> 29:52.760
How was your gaming week?

29:52.760 --> 29:54.800
I played Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.760
Kicking it old school.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.760
Yeah.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.360
And then I realized, wait, why the crap am I trying to play this with the keyboard when

30:00.360 --> 30:05.240
I could just hook up the nomad and play it on the Genesis?

30:05.240 --> 30:12.320
So anyway, that was a one thing that I tried to play and I did play some more of that stupid

30:12.320 --> 30:16.160
fairy solitaire game because it's stupid and addicting and stupid.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.160
Did I say stupid?

30:17.160 --> 30:19.160
Cause it's really stupid.

30:19.160 --> 30:23.480
Um, and uh, oh yeah, I did play some Mass Effect.

30:23.480 --> 30:31.920
Actually, I played a lot of Mass Effect and I played, um, wow, like for about 15 minutes

30:31.920 --> 30:34.280
and um, I bought some games.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.160
I got Limbo and I got closure.

30:36.160 --> 30:43.320
I think I got closure though before last week, which is a neat game that uses light to create

30:43.320 --> 30:47.980
your platforms or whatever the light shines on is what actually exists.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.980
If there's no light on it, it doesn't exist.

30:49.980 --> 30:54.140
So if you step back outside your spotlight, you'll fall through the ground and you can

30:54.140 --> 30:57.420
either fall into another level or you can fall to your death.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.420
That's part of it.

30:58.420 --> 31:02.340
I bought Assassin's Creed 2, which is the only game in that series that I ever really,

31:02.340 --> 31:08.620
you know, care about because it's set in Renaissance Italy and just, I don't know.

31:08.620 --> 31:10.460
I kind of want to gank a de Medici.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.340
You know, wouldn't that be fun?

31:13.340 --> 31:15.420
Do you know who the de Medicis were?

31:15.420 --> 31:17.420
You shook your head.

31:17.420 --> 31:22.540
The de Medicis hired Michelangelo to design defenses for the house.

31:22.540 --> 31:26.340
Not Michelangelo, Leonardo, one of those two.

31:26.340 --> 31:30.460
And I remember one of them used to like mumble to himself in like one of the de Medicis diaries

31:30.460 --> 31:35.500
and a bunch of them were popes and they also were persecuted during the bonfire of the

31:35.500 --> 31:36.500
vanities.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.500
Wow.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.940
I'm picturing Ninja Turtles, but I know you're not talking about that.

31:39.940 --> 31:43.840
Fifth Dream in our chat room says, Dark Sakura, is it taking you this long to beat Mass Effect

31:43.840 --> 31:45.100
or do you play it over and over?

31:45.100 --> 31:46.100
I play it over and over.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.260
I'm on my sixth play through right now.

31:48.260 --> 31:51.540
And my big thing now is that I got FlyCam to work.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.940
I finally bothered working on FlyCam.

31:53.940 --> 31:58.580
So now I've been going around getting compromising screen captures of my character shooting things

31:58.580 --> 32:00.380
and lasers and stuff.

32:00.380 --> 32:03.980
And I finally figured out now how to get FlyCam to work in the cinematics.

32:03.980 --> 32:06.100
So that's going to be even better.

32:06.100 --> 32:09.580
Lots of fun screens.

32:09.580 --> 32:14.580
And sort of speaking of video games, Mass Effect dot tumbler dot com.

32:14.580 --> 32:15.940
Picking up some steam.

32:15.940 --> 32:17.740
There you go.

32:17.740 --> 32:19.660
Speaking of steam, more stuff needs to go on sale.

32:19.660 --> 32:20.660
The end.

32:20.660 --> 32:21.660
All right.

32:21.660 --> 32:26.340
Loki, how was your gaming week?

32:26.340 --> 32:28.340
I bought a lot of things.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.940
Ironically, though, nothing from steam.

32:30.940 --> 32:33.380
I mean, it is on steam, but it's not from steam.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.940
So that that's weird thing.

32:34.940 --> 32:37.340
It's like because steam had a bunch of stuff on sale.

32:37.340 --> 32:39.460
But you know who also had stuff on sale?

32:39.460 --> 32:40.460
Amazon.

32:40.460 --> 32:46.220
Amazon had a ton of shit on sale and they had a ton of bundles on sale for really cheap.

32:46.220 --> 32:51.140
Like I picked up one with Bioshock one and two and Duke Nukem Forever and Borderlands

32:51.140 --> 32:53.380
Game of the Year edition, even though I already have it.

32:53.380 --> 32:57.700
So obviously I'm going to be giving away games at some point soon.

32:57.700 --> 33:02.660
There's also another THQ bundle that they had that had like seven games in it for like

33:02.660 --> 33:03.660
seven bucks.

33:03.660 --> 33:06.740
It's like, fuck, I can't pass that up.

33:06.740 --> 33:08.980
That's awesome.

33:08.980 --> 33:15.060
And then then I bought something else because I've been talking about it for a long time

33:15.060 --> 33:16.060
now.

33:16.060 --> 33:20.120
I'm just like, you know, for that price, I can't I can't pass that up.

33:20.120 --> 33:25.980
So I bought and actually played a good 13 hours of Final Fantasy 11.

33:25.980 --> 33:29.400
And it's definitely different from when I was playing it before.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.020
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

33:31.020 --> 33:35.580
And there's it's a seriously it's a ghost town there.

33:35.580 --> 33:40.660
And here's the funniest part, I actually tweeted about this because I was trying to get a few

33:40.660 --> 33:41.660
other people to buy.

33:41.660 --> 33:47.200
It was down to five bucks for everything like the game and all of the expansions.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.200
Five dollars.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.200
Well, they're ramping up.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.060
They just announced the release of the next expansion is like the end of March or something.

33:52.060 --> 33:55.780
So they're probably just trying to get a lot of people that will want to buy the expansion

33:55.780 --> 33:56.980
full price.

33:56.980 --> 33:57.980
That game.

33:57.980 --> 34:01.900
I mean, we're probably getting to we're getting the predictions, I know, for 2013 later on.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.780
But that game is going free to play this year.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.380
There's our next year.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.500
There's no way.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.500
It's dead.

34:07.500 --> 34:10.440
I mean, it's just there's no one there.

34:10.440 --> 34:14.060
Like I was literally I'm soloing myself as a white mage right now.

34:14.060 --> 34:19.460
I'm up to level 17 solo because you get so much more experience now, not even necessarily

34:19.460 --> 34:21.580
just from the book burning the book burning.

34:21.580 --> 34:24.700
I didn't really do that that much because there's no one like, you know how you would

34:24.700 --> 34:27.600
say you were saying go do the book burning with parties up.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.600
There's no one there.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.600
There's no one there.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.960
They're all gone in Guskin mines and Guskin mines.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.960
There's no one there.

34:32.960 --> 34:36.480
All like rank 99 or like level 99 stuff.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.760
So there's no one to book burn with.

34:38.760 --> 34:44.520
And you know, so I kind of did it a little bit through through one of the tombs or whatever

34:44.520 --> 34:45.640
right next to Ron for.

34:45.640 --> 34:50.360
But it's a little delayed reaction from dark Tetsuya in our chat room.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.360
Wait, what?

34:51.360 --> 34:52.640
Loki went back to Final Fantasy 11.

34:52.640 --> 34:55.520
Yeah, I don't know if it's going to I mean, I don't know if I'm actually going to pay

34:55.520 --> 34:56.520
for it.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.640
But I'm playing for the 30 days at the very least, because, you know, I got it for 10

34:59.640 --> 35:00.640
bucks.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.640
And so I'm going to check it out.

35:01.720 --> 35:06.240
It's just I kind of want to have it because I do think it's going to go free to play and

35:06.240 --> 35:08.120
I just want to be ready for when that happens.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.260
Fifth Dream in chat.

35:09.260 --> 35:10.260
Got it on your recommendation.

35:10.260 --> 35:11.260
Yeah.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.260
So you weren't alone.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.260
Yeah.

35:13.260 --> 35:14.260
So good.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.260
And but seriously, there's like no one around.

35:15.260 --> 35:19.180
I mean, there's I was doing just checks of different places like the dunes.

35:19.180 --> 35:22.040
There's like 19 people there.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.240
Maybe nobody levels there anymore.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.240
No one.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.420
That's that's just not just there.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.560
There's no one place where people are like.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.560
I was like, OK.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.920
I was like, OK, there's probably people there.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.920
Nope.

35:32.920 --> 35:33.920
There's like 10 people there.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.840
And we're like, you know, there's just it's just a ghost town.

35:36.840 --> 35:42.740
What I usually do, I go in or that time, that month or two that I was on it, you zone in

35:42.740 --> 35:46.280
the Guskin mines, see if there's anybody fighting right at the very start.

35:46.280 --> 35:51.220
Like once you run past the initial like cave and just do a say, please invite to what they

35:51.220 --> 35:52.220
don't call it raid.

35:52.220 --> 35:53.220
What do they call it?

35:53.220 --> 35:54.220
Alliance or something.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.460
Please invite to alliance or whatever party.

35:55.460 --> 35:56.460
Can I have it?

35:56.460 --> 35:57.640
You know, the whole auto translating.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.040
And they'll just invite you right into the party.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.040
So it goes.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.320
So even if there's only 10 people in there, if they're all doing the leveling thing, just

36:03.320 --> 36:06.400
so I'm also not high enough level to do that because I'm only level 17 right now.

36:06.400 --> 36:07.400
Do it.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.400
Seventeen's a great level for that.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
Yeah, maybe.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.400
Oh, trust me.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.400
Trust me.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.400
People start doing it at 12.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.400
All right.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.400
Well, I don't know.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.400
It's just all new to me.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.840
So right now I'm just soloing and I'm just going to probably try to get the 20 so I can

36:18.840 --> 36:23.280
get my subclass thing going again and do all that stuff.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.280
And I don't know.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.000
By that time, it'll be the end of January and then they'll quit because I don't want

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
to pay 13 bucks a month for it.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.480
But it's interesting and like I said, it's very different.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.480
Like, I don't know what's going on anymore.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.040
Playing it on the computer now versus what you had like five years ago, I'm sure is a

36:39.040 --> 36:40.040
big shock to me.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.720
Well, yeah, I can max out everything and I play on a controller.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.600
So, you know, I do that.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.720
I mean, I have my macros still, but since I'm playing on my laptop, you know, I just

36:48.720 --> 36:53.040
use my macros on my keyboard and I play everything else on my Xbox 360 controller.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.520
I used to have all of my macros done through my top two triggers.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.600
Yeah, it's just I could do that, too, but I just don't want to.

36:59.600 --> 37:04.040
I mean, I just it's a lot easier for me just to, you know, take my hand off the controller

37:04.040 --> 37:07.040
and do, you know, control one, control two or whatever.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.520
So I've just been doing that.

37:08.520 --> 37:15.760
And I don't know, I've noticed like some new character, like new things like floating around

37:15.760 --> 37:16.760
like there's all these pixies.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.560
I don't know where the hell those are, but I pick fights with them and kill them.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.640
Although it's weird, though, because I was resting one time and one of them healed me.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.400
They come by and they heal you and they randomly raise you like if you're dead.

37:26.600 --> 37:32.080
Oh, well, I've been just pissing them off and trying to kill them way to go.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.160
Fuck you. Fuck you.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.640
I agree with acidic vampire.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.040
It's boring and it's a chore.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.560
I was just read his comment.

37:39.560 --> 37:43.960
A city vampire says I went to went back to fantasy eleven a few months ago, but stopped.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.560
It did get boring and it was more of a chore than entertaining.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.360
Yeah, that's what I'm kind of thinking, too, because there's not anyone on there.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.560
But like I said, you know, just want to get the software and get it downloaded and

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
check it out just for a little bit, just because I was curious.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.840
Ten bucks. I mean, that's less than a month of actually paying for it.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.040
And five bucks, if you got lucky, that's even better.

38:00.400 --> 38:03.440
But, you know, it's all the expansion so far.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.760
You know, the new one will probably come out.

38:04.760 --> 38:10.640
But I figure and I started a new character, too, because I could have done it on my

38:10.640 --> 38:14.280
old account. Of course, I wouldn't have gotten a free month on my free month.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.800
So, you know, I started a whole new one and.

38:18.600 --> 38:22.520
I don't know, it's all right, it's just I wish there was someone to play with.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.520
And there's really no one around.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.880
I mean, it's just empty.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.440
I'd love to come play, but if I hadn't burned myself out on it.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.080
No, seriously, it's just it's very, very empty.

38:33.080 --> 38:36.160
And I know you can get like what AI characters or whatever to help you out.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.480
I'm not really sure how that works.

38:37.480 --> 38:41.440
And I don't either. I think something like I said, I don't really know what's going

38:41.440 --> 38:42.600
on in the game at all.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.400
And I was like trying to remember what I'm supposed to be doing as far.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.840
I mean, I know we're the kind of level and stuff before, but I was trying to remember

38:48.840 --> 38:52.360
like what I'm supposed to be doing as far as like, you know, I know there's some

38:53.240 --> 38:58.360
Sindori quests and stuff that you can do and just I don't know it.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.560
I'm enjoying it somewhat.

39:00.560 --> 39:05.160
It's just kind of good to like just play it and like let my mind just kind of go

39:05.160 --> 39:06.480
because it's there's really no.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.640
But there's like literally no one around.

39:08.640 --> 39:12.040
Like I was just running around and I run across a couple of people and that's it.

39:12.120 --> 39:17.360
And like even buying stuff from like the auction houses, stuff you need, it's just

39:17.360 --> 39:19.200
not there because there's no one there.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.320
Out of curiosity, is this getting you jazzed for Final Fantasy 14?

39:22.520 --> 39:22.920
Nope.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.320
No, I thought I'd try.

39:25.360 --> 39:26.120
Not at all.

39:26.120 --> 39:31.160
I mean, I saw a video of it looks nice, but it's just no, I'd rather honestly, when

39:31.160 --> 39:34.880
Final Fantasy 14 comes out, I'd rather wait for this to go free play and play this

39:34.880 --> 39:39.280
instead because this seems like it'd be more more interesting.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.840
I mean, a 14 looks all right, but I'm sure it's not going to run that great on my

39:42.840 --> 39:43.160
laptop.

39:43.160 --> 39:48.160
I mean, it'll run all right on my laptop, but it's just not going to be, you know, as

39:48.200 --> 39:52.160
smooth and I don't know how many people are going to be playing it.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.080
It looks nice though.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.440
I mean, it's just, I like 11.

39:58.440 --> 39:58.920
I don't know.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.480
It's 11 that I dedicate a lot, a lot of time to.

40:01.600 --> 40:01.920
Okay.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.760
So anyways, enough with 11, but other things I've been playing, I actually played

40:05.960 --> 40:07.320
Borderlands 2 and went back to that.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.040
So I've been playing co-op with my coworker.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.240
So we've been playing through that and that it's actually pretty awesome.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.160
So we got a little bit through the storyline.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.920
Finally met up with, um, Oh, who the fuck is it?

40:19.480 --> 40:20.840
Uh, the little girl that's crazy.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.600
I don't remember her name anyways.

40:22.640 --> 40:23.400
Um,

40:26.800 --> 40:27.760
a tiny Tina.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.600
That's the one.

40:28.920 --> 40:33.760
So I met up with tiny Tina and she's just crazy, but I love the, just the humor in

40:33.760 --> 40:37.840
the game is hilarious, you know, where she's like, you know, I need you to collect

40:37.840 --> 40:40.600
my badonkadonks, which are these giant missiles.

40:40.600 --> 40:44.960
And so then she straps, you know, these stuffed dolls to it.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.320
Okay.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.720
Put the damsels on the train track, you know?

40:47.840 --> 40:52.240
And so she, and then she's like, okay, signal me when, when you want me to fire

40:52.240 --> 40:53.040
these or whatever.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.280
And she's like, I got tired of waiting.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.760
So I fired it anyways, and it blows up the train track.

40:57.760 --> 41:01.600
And then she's just like, Oh, it's just the humor.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.280
The dialogue in the game is just awesome.

41:03.280 --> 41:06.040
So, um, so that's pretty cool.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.960
And we're just playing through that a little bit.

41:08.040 --> 41:10.000
And what else did I play this week?

41:10.240 --> 41:13.040
Um, modern warfare three, a little bit more of that still.

41:13.280 --> 41:19.400
Um, I got this device called a Moga, which is from a company called PowerA.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.600
They were actually giving them away for like one day as part of like the secret

41:22.600 --> 41:23.640
Santa promotion thing.

41:24.040 --> 41:30.040
And so basically what a Moga is, it's this Bluetooth controller for an Android phone.

41:30.040 --> 41:33.920
And what's kind of cool about it though, is it has this little like slot that, or

41:33.920 --> 41:39.200
this little clasp that you can kind of, um, adjust to fit your phone and you play

41:39.200 --> 41:41.320
like a handheld gaming pad.

41:41.320 --> 41:46.240
I mean, it looks kind of similar to like a Xbox 360 controller crossed with a

41:46.600 --> 41:51.400
classic controller because they've got the analog placements of the Xbox 360.

41:51.400 --> 41:56.440
There's no D pad, although the left analog kind of has this diamond thing on it

41:56.440 --> 41:59.360
where it kind of does it eight way.

41:59.560 --> 42:03.960
Um, or it has it where you can kind of do it almost like a direction on it.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.400
Um, to make it a little bit easier.

42:05.400 --> 42:09.200
And then of course, you know, the X, Y, A, B buttons and two shoulder buttons.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.440
Um, and what's kind of cool is it came with some games with it.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.880
It came with modern combat four, which I haven't been able to download yet because

42:15.880 --> 42:19.480
my phone, it's the way they have it partitioned.

42:19.480 --> 42:24.920
I've got like, you know, 16 gigs on it, but two gigs of it is dedicated to apps.

42:25.080 --> 42:30.720
And there's no easy way to download something into that open, like that kind

42:30.720 --> 42:32.680
of virtual SD card that's in there.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.200
Um, so I've been unable to download that, but I was able to download

42:36.200 --> 42:38.440
Sonic CD for it and it plays awesome.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.160
I mean, it's just, it works great.

42:40.400 --> 42:44.400
And so they've comes with that comes a Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.520
So, but it works good with the controller.

42:46.520 --> 42:50.760
So, uh, I am glad to see that this does work with Grand Theft Auto Vice City,

42:50.800 --> 42:52.680
which is just really CHD version of that.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.400
So, and I hear that's not selling as well as they had hoped.

42:55.480 --> 42:57.320
Well, I don't know if that's probably help.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.920
I mean, and this thing normally, I mean, if you, if I even get for free,

43:00.920 --> 43:04.160
it would have cost me 50 bucks, but I think it's worth it.

43:04.160 --> 43:07.680
And if you have a tablet or whatever, it will work wirelessly with your

43:07.680 --> 43:10.240
tablet because it's Bluetooth, which is kind of awesome.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.280
So, uh, you know, if you're looking for a controller, that might

43:12.280 --> 43:13.400
not be a bad one to pick up.

43:13.920 --> 43:17.400
Um, and it's, it's pretty small to you fits in your pocket.

43:17.600 --> 43:21.680
So I had that and, uh, what else did I apply this week?

43:21.920 --> 43:22.240
I don't know.

43:22.240 --> 43:22.960
I have a lot of games.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.040
Like I said, I bought stuff on steam sales and stuff.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.520
We've got like, he's, I'm hopefully going to give away for some games

43:27.520 --> 43:29.920
that I already have, uh, or games.

43:29.920 --> 43:30.720
I just don't want to play.

43:31.160 --> 43:35.440
And, um, so we'll figure out a way to do that soon.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.560
And yeah, sounds good.

43:38.400 --> 43:38.800
All right.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.640
Well, I want to move on with our gaming weeks, but I want to say hello to

43:41.640 --> 43:43.240
somebody else who's joining us in studio.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.640
Who's kind of been walking in and out, which he's allowed to

43:45.640 --> 43:46.920
do because it's his place too.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.160
Everybody say hello to Alan.

43:48.240 --> 43:48.720
Hello.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.440
How are you doing Alan?

43:49.560 --> 43:50.000
Good.

43:50.080 --> 43:50.440
I'm sorry.

43:50.440 --> 43:54.160
I was sick last week and closed down the OLR studio with my Ebola.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.200
But you're feeling much better now, right?

43:56.200 --> 43:56.440
Yes.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.720
I had a head cold for six days.

43:57.720 --> 43:58.480
I don't recommend it.

43:59.680 --> 44:04.680
How did you, how did you finally cure yourself of the Ebola super yucky barf?

44:05.520 --> 44:08.920
You just wait six days until your immune system gets rid of it.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.600
There's really nothing I can do.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.520
I bought this, um, spray for my nose that felt like acid.

44:15.040 --> 44:15.680
That wasn't fun.

44:15.680 --> 44:16.280
It worked.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.320
I could breathe afterwards.

44:17.320 --> 44:20.080
Cause I think it burned out my skull, but did you, do you blame

44:20.080 --> 44:21.480
Obamacare for making you sick?

44:22.000 --> 44:22.440
I'm just kidding.

44:22.440 --> 44:22.960
Don't answer that.

44:23.000 --> 44:23.280
All right.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.840
Let's I blame coworkers.

44:26.560 --> 44:26.840
All right.

44:26.840 --> 44:27.480
Fair enough.

44:28.840 --> 44:29.200
All right.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.760
Uh, let's, uh, talk about your gaming week.

44:31.760 --> 44:32.680
So you were sick.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.880
So that's a great chance for you to play lots of games.

44:35.080 --> 44:36.600
Nothing like being sick on Christmas.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.160
What did you play?

44:37.280 --> 44:41.640
I was, I only played three games really the last couple of weeks.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.240
Wow.

44:42.920 --> 44:47.240
Um, this is more a discussion for Horde house, but I have no problems

44:47.240 --> 44:50.280
at all with this expansion pandaria, but the magic has been gone for me

44:50.280 --> 44:54.400
since like this summer, so I haven't been playing it nearly as much as I should.

44:54.840 --> 44:55.960
But I got played some wow.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.520
I played some Mass Effect two and I played some walking dead.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.960
So Mass Effect two.

45:00.960 --> 45:01.120
Okay.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.520
We've heard a lot about Mass Effect on the show, but you do like this

45:03.520 --> 45:05.640
mod thing, right with high res textures.

45:05.680 --> 45:08.320
Well, I'm on my third character.

45:08.720 --> 45:12.760
She is my female paragon, which is kind of like a good guy.

45:12.760 --> 45:16.320
Cause my first woman that I played was a renegade, which is more kind of an asshole.

45:16.880 --> 45:20.640
So it's my third career and yeah, I have all these high res textures

45:20.640 --> 45:25.040
for Mass Effect two that the community has made and they look awesome.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.200
But the only problem is, is that when you load them up, it takes it literally,

45:28.200 --> 45:31.920
I have to start it up and walk away and it takes the game 15 minutes to load.

45:33.240 --> 45:38.240
So I, if I want to play Mass Effect two, I got to give at least an hour

45:38.240 --> 45:41.640
to 90 minutes time, because if I'm going to let the game load for 20 minutes,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.600
I can't just do a mission and sign off.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.280
It's a waste of time.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.600
You have way too much patience.

45:46.280 --> 45:50.000
Well, I can all tab and look at Chrome or mess with my phone or tumbler tumbler.

45:50.040 --> 45:50.440
Yeah.

45:50.680 --> 45:50.960
All right.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.720
Uh, let's talk about walking dead.

45:52.760 --> 45:55.160
That's again, we haven't talked a lot about on this show, but you,

45:55.200 --> 45:56.360
uh, checked it out this week.

45:56.360 --> 45:56.760
What'd you think?

45:57.200 --> 45:59.280
I don't want to steal your thunder, but it was nice.

45:59.320 --> 46:02.920
Um, I was spoiled because I am on tumblr a lot.

46:02.920 --> 46:06.640
When episode five came out within a day, all of the animated gifts and

46:06.640 --> 46:10.000
YouTube clips and just discussions were going on my dash about what

46:10.000 --> 46:13.480
happens in the ending of, um, uh, chapter five.

46:13.840 --> 46:19.880
So I was like, Oh, that ending look, I'm not going to say anything about it, but

46:20.080 --> 46:23.400
I was like, I guess I should say that now that I know how it ends and how everyone

46:23.400 --> 46:25.280
is losing their shit over how it ends in a good way.

46:25.320 --> 46:30.840
So I just, and then also I saw you playing it and the fact it was 10 bucks on XBLA,

46:30.840 --> 46:35.000
right, and it was 12 bucks for the season pass on steam and like steam, of course,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.840
is having it's we hate you and we want you to be poor sale.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.080
So, um, that's a good name for it.

46:40.200 --> 46:43.600
So, um, despite the fact that, you know, you had the ending already ruined for

46:43.600 --> 46:46.320
you of episode five, how did you enjoy playing through episode one?

46:46.920 --> 46:47.760
It was good.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.040
I'm trying to juggle between being a perfectionist and wanting to play it with

46:52.080 --> 46:55.600
a FAQ open, just so I can see all the different ways I could control the story

46:55.600 --> 46:58.520
in later chapters, which I know is cheating, but I don't have that count.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.480
I have that kind of time.

46:59.480 --> 47:00.040
I don't care.

47:00.440 --> 47:04.920
Um, and also just wanting to be a contrarian because I wanted to do stuff

47:04.920 --> 47:08.200
that was opposite of what you were doing so that I can say, Oh, well, if you do

47:08.200 --> 47:09.680
this, then this is what happens instead.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.560
Cause like you have an iPhone and I have an Android cause I'm different like that.

47:12.840 --> 47:18.560
So yeah, I was like, I wanted, I'm trying to juggle between having things be as

47:18.560 --> 47:21.680
good as possible for my character, but also wanting to do like backwards.

47:22.000 --> 47:22.960
Ass backwards stuff.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.520
Doesn't that sound like somebody you want to date guys?

47:25.520 --> 47:28.800
Somebody that does intentionally the opposite of everything that you do.

47:28.800 --> 47:34.120
Just in video games and he has an Android and I have an iPhone.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.840
Yeah, clearly he's smarter than you.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.000
Hey, fuck off.

47:38.080 --> 47:38.440
All right.

47:39.480 --> 47:42.520
So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to steal your thunder, but if I'm going to mimic

47:42.520 --> 47:46.880
everything you do when you play, I should just sit behind you and watch you play

47:47.720 --> 47:48.240
myself.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.320
I'm going to have different people live than you do.

47:50.320 --> 47:51.240
And I'm going to do.

47:51.240 --> 47:51.520
Yeah.

47:52.080 --> 47:52.280
All right.

47:52.280 --> 47:52.680
That's fair.

47:52.760 --> 47:53.120
That's fair.

47:53.440 --> 47:54.640
But you do recommend it.

47:54.960 --> 47:55.240
Yeah.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.560
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

47:58.280 --> 47:59.120
Tiny tower.

48:00.120 --> 48:00.720
Sucks.

48:00.760 --> 48:01.200
No, I'm kidding.

48:01.480 --> 48:01.920
All right.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.200
Uh, we'll move on.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.600
So you're going to come back for part B and talk about game of the

48:05.600 --> 48:06.440
year and all that with us, right?

48:06.680 --> 48:07.080
Yes.

48:07.200 --> 48:07.520
Okay.

48:07.560 --> 48:08.120
We'll see you then.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.760
Uh, for now, Flaco, how was your gaming week?

48:11.600 --> 48:16.240
I had a, I had a very busy gaming week because I had the week off of work and

48:16.240 --> 48:19.200
I'm not playing wow right now because wow eats up a lot of time.

48:19.200 --> 48:22.360
I love it, but I just wanted to really focus on console stuff this week.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.840
So I played more Nino Cooney demo.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.520
I just play cause my son likes to watch it cause it's a cartoon.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.280
And, and then I liked playing it too.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.360
And so it gives me an excuse.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.840
I played the, I finished the walking dead after Christmas.

48:36.840 --> 48:41.560
I took, I took Christmas off of playing it, uh, because, uh, Exeter was in town

48:41.560 --> 48:43.720
and he didn't want to see how it was ended.

48:43.880 --> 48:45.360
So I waited and I waited.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.360
And as soon as he left, I finished playing it.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.960
So, and it was great.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.240
It was a great game.

48:50.480 --> 48:54.240
And I feel so bad that Alan got spoiled on the ending because I think that really

48:54.240 --> 48:56.000
helps not knowing what's going to happen.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.800
It's a, I think I know what happens, but I'm really trying to keep my

48:59.800 --> 49:02.640
spells self spoiler free and I'm just kind of trying to forget.

49:02.640 --> 49:06.080
I heard that and just taking the game at face value, but I'm still really

49:06.080 --> 49:08.280
enjoying episode one so far personally.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.320
I thought I knew what happened and luckily I was wrong.

49:10.480 --> 49:11.320
Oh, okay, cool.

49:11.520 --> 49:13.160
So yeah, I thought I heard a spoiler.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.800
Like I thought, and I was like, I thought I read something for two sec.

49:15.800 --> 49:16.720
I saw some words.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.760
I'm like, ah, the words erased from my memory.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.040
And then I just, you know, kept playing and I was like, oh good.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.000
What I thought was going to happen.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.720
Didn't happen just cause I read a few words and started making assumptions.

49:25.720 --> 49:29.880
So, so just real quick about, you know, the game, would this be something

49:29.880 --> 49:33.160
that would be all right for someone that doesn't follow the series?

49:33.160 --> 49:35.640
Cause I honestly, I've never watched nothing to do with a TV show.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.240
No, you don't have to read the comic book either.

49:37.240 --> 49:40.000
It doesn't matter as long as you know, the basic concept.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.400
I mean, they pretty much explain everything for you anyway, because it

49:43.400 --> 49:48.000
takes place and I guess at the start of the whole thing anyway, and you're

49:48.000 --> 49:51.040
in someone else's shoes, so everything's getting explained to you as if you were

49:51.040 --> 49:55.760
brand new, so you get the rules of the series and the comic, like it's

49:55.760 --> 49:57.400
really easy to jump into it.

49:57.840 --> 49:58.800
I don't read the comics.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.800
I just watched the show.

49:59.840 --> 50:03.440
So I don't even watch the show and I was able to get into it.

50:03.960 --> 50:07.120
I mean, it has a, it has an ambiguous opening, but like a lot

50:07.120 --> 50:08.960
of TV shows and movies do so.

50:08.960 --> 50:10.840
The show and I believe the comic opens the same way.

50:10.840 --> 50:14.000
Like nobody, I don't think, because like I said, didn't read the comic,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.480
but I don't think anyone knows how the whole thing started.

50:17.720 --> 50:19.200
Everybody gets kind of thrown into it.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.520
So they started the same way.

50:20.920 --> 50:24.280
Um, now obviously trying to be very, uh, careful not to spoil anything.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.880
Cause we have like act-deaf and Chad is like, no spoilers, please.

50:26.880 --> 50:27.960
No, we're not, we're not going to spoil.

50:27.960 --> 50:28.840
We're not assholes, don't worry.

50:29.120 --> 50:34.600
But, um, uh, I have heard a lot of people say like through the Twitters

50:34.600 --> 50:38.360
and so forth, that the walking dead has one of the best endings in a video

50:38.360 --> 50:43.880
game ever, would you sign up, would you sign ever, but it was really good.

50:43.920 --> 50:48.240
I mean, because you're so emotionally invested in the whole game, then when,

50:48.280 --> 50:51.920
you know, when you get to the end, it just feels like all the other choices

50:51.920 --> 50:54.560
you made are all like important.

50:54.920 --> 50:56.880
And that's, that's like a really cool thing.

50:56.920 --> 51:01.280
I find that fascinating, like in the wake of everything, everybody complained

51:01.280 --> 51:03.800
about with Mass Effect 3 this year, because like Mass Effect 3 was kind

51:03.800 --> 51:07.040
of the opposite of that word, but he bitched about the ending unless the

51:07.120 --> 51:09.400
first time you played through the ending was with the extended cut.

51:09.440 --> 51:09.920
Well, okay.

51:09.920 --> 51:11.360
But, but I didn't have that.

51:11.400 --> 51:14.960
And before that was in there and so forth, you know, as much as I loved Mass Effect

51:14.960 --> 51:19.720
3, the ending, and I still defend the ending to an extent, like I think

51:19.720 --> 51:22.160
people blow it way out of proportion.

51:22.800 --> 51:25.480
I think it's a fine ending, especially after the extended cut.

51:25.680 --> 51:28.960
But one of the biggest bitches even I had with it when I first did it was that it

51:28.960 --> 51:33.160
really seemed like a lot of the stuff you were working with, with the galaxy rating

51:33.160 --> 51:36.560
and things like that, didn't really end up doing shit when all was said and done.

51:36.800 --> 51:38.680
Like it didn't really play into it.

51:38.680 --> 51:40.160
And that's where a lot of people got upset with it.

51:40.160 --> 51:42.840
So it's kind of funny the way you talk about the walking dead.

51:42.840 --> 51:47.000
It really sounds like a lot, like you do get that reward.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.560
And maybe, yeah, I mean, it's hard to say because this was probably all in

51:50.560 --> 51:55.560
development long before Mass Effect 3 came out, but maybe Telltale kind of

51:55.560 --> 51:59.760
saw the reaction to Mass Effect 3's ending and made sure we're not going to do that.

52:00.200 --> 52:00.400
Yeah.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.480
And it's in the details because the actual, the actual ending you get,

52:03.520 --> 52:05.120
everybody gets the same ending.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.800
There's not alternate endings to this game.

52:07.240 --> 52:11.240
Everybody gets the same one, but it's in the details leading up to that final

52:11.240 --> 52:13.160
screen that everybody sees that's different.

52:13.320 --> 52:16.480
And the final, like one of the, one of the last kind of confrontations in the

52:16.480 --> 52:21.200
game, very heavy on past choices, all the way back to episode one and two and

52:21.200 --> 52:21.720
things like that.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.360
So fascinating.

52:22.360 --> 52:23.320
I mean, it's really cool.

52:23.320 --> 52:25.280
And I want to just blow through the whole series.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.160
You'll get to that part.

52:26.160 --> 52:27.640
You're like, why did I do that?

52:27.640 --> 52:29.040
Or why didn't I do this?

52:29.040 --> 52:30.720
And it's, it's really cool.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.880
It's just, they're really just details and it's story stuff, but I think that's

52:34.880 --> 52:37.600
what makes it so good because you're so invested in this so that when that

52:37.600 --> 52:41.640
happens, but the actual literal ending is the same for everybody.

52:41.800 --> 52:42.080
All right.

52:42.200 --> 52:45.840
Like did that, like whatever happens, you know, at the end is the end.

52:46.520 --> 52:47.880
Uh, what else for your gaming week?

52:48.000 --> 52:55.560
Oh, so for Christmas, my wife got me a PlayStation move, so I was playing a lot

52:55.560 --> 52:56.120
of games with that.

52:56.120 --> 53:00.840
I immediately got portal two in motion and what else did I get?

53:00.880 --> 53:02.840
Oh, I got the little big motion pack.

53:02.840 --> 53:06.120
We just got booted from chat cause there's too many people connected guys.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.000
So we're not in chat.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.280
Did you try to join chat Alan?

53:09.760 --> 53:10.960
That was a no, no.

53:11.000 --> 53:11.400
Okay.

53:11.400 --> 53:14.600
So we had five people join chat and now none of us can be in.

53:14.600 --> 53:17.400
Now none of us can be in so fast.

53:17.480 --> 53:18.120
We'll be at it.

53:18.160 --> 53:18.800
Oh, I will.

53:19.200 --> 53:20.160
I'll be back in chat.

53:20.240 --> 53:20.600
Okay.

53:20.720 --> 53:21.640
As soon as I get my phone up.

53:21.760 --> 53:24.440
So we're going to try to get a plan B here in a minute.

53:24.440 --> 53:25.960
Alan broke the rule.

53:28.520 --> 53:31.840
He's yelling at me from the other room that I didn't know the role I was in.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.000
I would have just not been in chat.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
I didn't have to be in chat.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.680
All right, so we're going to try to get back in chat as soon as we can guys.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.880
It's going to be a little bit though, so just bear with us.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.120
Uh, but anyhow, let's just move forward.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.680
So, um, what else for your gaming week?

53:43.840 --> 53:46.920
Okay, so yeah, so I got, so my wife gave me the PlayStation move because I've

53:46.920 --> 53:51.320
been, I'm always bugging her, uh, her oldest brother and her sister-in-law to

53:51.320 --> 53:53.520
borrow theirs, but they are, their kids use it.

53:53.520 --> 53:56.000
They played just dance and like, but I want to use it cause I want to play, you

53:56.000 --> 53:59.200
know, I played heavy rain when I borrowed theirs and, but then I heard the portal

53:59.240 --> 54:02.160
two, uh, in motion pack came out and like, I want that so bad.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.680
So my wife just got me one.

54:03.680 --> 54:04.440
So now I can play it.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.600
I downloaded the portal two in motion.

54:06.600 --> 54:07.680
That was really cool.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.800
I only played like a couple levels.

54:09.800 --> 54:12.520
I played the tutorial and some of the levels after that.

54:12.920 --> 54:13.800
It was really fun.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.560
A little big planet with move is awesome.

54:17.160 --> 54:19.520
Uh, the move levels specifically are really good.

54:19.880 --> 54:23.880
And I played some, gosh, what is it called?

54:23.880 --> 54:24.680
It's like Cooper.

54:24.720 --> 54:28.760
Those had just lame move mini games, but, um, yeah, I'm excited.

54:28.800 --> 54:29.440
It works pretty well.

54:29.440 --> 54:34.320
And I played the Epic Mickey two demo, which I didn't like because, well, first

54:34.320 --> 54:37.200
I played it before I got a motion controller and I thought they were going

54:37.200 --> 54:40.080
to fix it where you didn't have to have motion control and they did, but you

54:40.080 --> 54:43.640
have to use the right analog stick to kind of aim, you know, where you paint

54:43.640 --> 54:44.000
stuff.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
And so I hated that.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.960
So when I got the move, I'm like, oh, let me try it again with that.

54:47.960 --> 54:50.680
And it was better with the move, but I still don't like the game.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.000
And what else is my gaming week?

54:53.000 --> 54:56.440
Oh, and then I bought journey because I finished walking dead and I'm like,

54:56.440 --> 54:58.640
ah, I want to play one more game of the year candidate.

54:58.640 --> 54:59.600
And I want something short.

54:59.840 --> 55:04.960
And I had played the journey demo, uh, when it came out, don't stop believing.

55:05.240 --> 55:05.720
Yes.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.720
And I actually wasn't that impressed by the demo, but everyone kept saying, well,

55:09.720 --> 55:11.800
it's better when you get further into the game or whatever.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.560
So, but I just kept putting it off, like I'll get it.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.160
What's on sale.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.840
Well, it went on sale for PlayStation's winter sale.

55:17.080 --> 55:21.400
And so I got it and luckily I didn't have to play the first level again.

55:21.400 --> 55:24.160
It actually saved my progress from when I played the demo.

55:24.280 --> 55:27.080
So I get to jump right into the game and immediately it gets better.

55:27.320 --> 55:29.760
And it is a short game, but I loved it.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.080
And the ending is just Epic.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.240
Like parts of that remind me of, you know,

55:34.240 --> 55:38.360
Corona trigger when you're walking up the mountain and the wind blows,

55:38.360 --> 55:39.600
you have to hide behind the trees.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.880
So you don't get blown off the mountain.

55:41.080 --> 55:41.960
There's stuff in journey.

55:41.960 --> 55:42.600
That's like that.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.840
I'm like, oh, that's so cool.

55:44.400 --> 55:47.080
So it doesn't blow you entirely off the mountain, but it's,

55:47.320 --> 55:48.760
there's some really cool stuff in journey.

55:48.760 --> 55:51.960
It was reminding me of other games and there's like a kind of a platforming

55:51.960 --> 55:54.600
level that's my favorite level and journey where you just have to climb

55:54.720 --> 55:56.040
this tower and I'd love it.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.880
And it was, it was a lot better.

55:58.920 --> 56:02.600
Like I played a couple levels by myself cause I think it's supposed to be

56:02.600 --> 56:03.920
online and there's people like there,

56:03.920 --> 56:07.320
but I think whoever I was with was way ahead of me and it was really lame.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.720
Like I can't keep up with this guy.

56:09.160 --> 56:12.560
Uh, but the second time I kind of started again at that because once you beat

56:12.560 --> 56:13.880
it, you can start anywhere in the game.

56:14.080 --> 56:15.640
So I started at that level again,

56:15.720 --> 56:18.320
which is pretty close to the end and I played it through the end again and I

56:18.320 --> 56:21.560
had a partner the whole time and I even got a trophy for playing the majority of

56:21.560 --> 56:24.120
the game with a one person the whole time.

56:24.120 --> 56:24.720
Oh wow. Nice.

56:24.720 --> 56:26.560
Yeah. So I just, there's me and this other person.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.800
I think we're both kind of the same skill level.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.360
Maybe I maybe it was their first time.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.640
I don't know, but it was kind of cool.

56:31.720 --> 56:32.680
That's awesome. Yeah.

56:33.200 --> 56:35.760
Uh, I just want to, just a quick note for the live listeners.

56:35.760 --> 56:39.520
I did manage to get back into chat on my mobile because what I did is I did over

56:39.520 --> 56:41.040
4g so I have a different IP now.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.600
So I am in on mobile, so I will be able to read a chat comment.

56:44.600 --> 56:47.960
Some people are still talking about a walking dead in chat right now and uh,

56:48.280 --> 56:48.840
let's see.

56:48.840 --> 56:52.400
Fantasm chat says journey and a point and click adventure game of the years.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.400
That's if you believe everything you read on the internet and seeing the TV shows

56:57.400 --> 56:58.000
and stuff. Yeah,

56:58.000 --> 57:01.120
it seems like those are the two that are kind of taken a lot of their awards.

57:01.160 --> 57:05.240
So they were both awesome. Yeah. That's what I'll say. It's great. Yeah.

57:05.240 --> 57:07.040
I love journey. And I, I, like I said,

57:07.040 --> 57:09.640
I was a little skeptical cause I played the demo and I wasn't super impressed.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.240
I'm like, really? I'm going to play this for, you know,

57:11.520 --> 57:12.960
three hours and love it. Well, I loved it.

57:13.480 --> 57:15.240
It's a short little three hour game and I love,

57:15.240 --> 57:17.400
so you can't always base your impressions of a game off the demo.

57:17.400 --> 57:21.520
No Bobby heard that. I had to work that in there. Come on. All right.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.680
Uh, anything else you want to share about your gaming week? Um,

57:24.800 --> 57:27.560
I think that's basically, Oh, you know what? Uh, on my anniversary,

57:27.560 --> 57:29.080
my wife got her hair done and while she was doing that,

57:29.080 --> 57:32.520
I played linked to the past on my phone and I'm the last study.

57:32.520 --> 57:35.240
I've played it before, but I haven't played in a long time and I'm not,

57:35.280 --> 57:38.080
I'm in Gannon's like final dungeon. So good choice.

57:38.080 --> 57:42.080
I'm excited to finish that again for the first time in a long time. Okay.

57:42.080 --> 57:43.080
I have to ask this.

57:43.080 --> 57:46.680
Do you get as pissed off as I do when you're fighting the worm thing and it

57:46.720 --> 57:51.720
knocks you off the platform 57 times in a row.

57:52.240 --> 57:55.560
Yes. I hate that. I hate anytime. Anything that knocks you off a platform.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.160
The first time I ever played that guy, it took me two hours. Oh my gosh.

58:00.240 --> 58:03.040
Because I kept getting interrupted by my brothers and every time fall.

58:03.600 --> 58:06.480
Luckily I just had the knowledge of doing it before. So this time I was like,

58:06.480 --> 58:11.320
okay, I remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The first time it was terrible.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.440
So this time I was like, Oh yeah,

58:12.440 --> 58:16.160
I can beat this guy down cause I know exactly what to do and I know what spells

58:16.160 --> 58:18.200
are abilities to use for each boss. So it's kind of cool.

58:19.520 --> 58:22.200
But that was it for my gaming week. Little old school game. You throw it in there.

58:22.440 --> 58:24.720
No. All right. Let me talk about my gaming week.

58:24.760 --> 58:26.920
Cause some of the games we've already discussed a little bit.

58:26.920 --> 58:31.320
I did finally get a chance to check out a walking dead episode one at least. Um,

58:31.360 --> 58:32.120
let me just say this.

58:32.120 --> 58:35.040
It was good enough where I downloaded episodes two through five right after.

58:35.040 --> 58:37.160
I thought it was great. I don't even watch the show.

58:37.160 --> 58:40.080
I don't watch a lot of TV shows. And you know, again,

58:40.400 --> 58:42.720
I find that there's a lot of people that are like, Oh,

58:42.720 --> 58:45.000
I don't want to play the games cause I don't want to spoil myself for the show.

58:45.000 --> 58:50.000
So just to be clear, games based off comics show based off books,

58:50.160 --> 58:53.320
right? Or something else. So is there based off the, well,

58:53.320 --> 58:54.760
it's based off the comic book universe.

58:54.760 --> 58:57.160
So it doesn't even spoil the comics cause it's a completely different thing.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.520
Yeah. So just they, they go different directions and the characters are there.

59:00.560 --> 59:04.000
Most of them are different and so forth. So yeah, you got all that going on.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.480
So just don't let that, um, ruin it for you. Um,

59:07.720 --> 59:09.480
some other games I played this week, um,

59:09.520 --> 59:11.800
I played a couple of racing games actually. Uh,

59:11.800 --> 59:15.360
the game rental service sent me a couple of racing games and I checked out need

59:15.360 --> 59:18.400
for speed. Most wanted that. Yeah. What do you think?

59:18.880 --> 59:20.320
Well, he's using his driving rig,

59:21.160 --> 59:24.320
the one he set up for that's going to make any racing game better for GT five.

59:24.520 --> 59:27.800
Yeah. He's been pretty into it. He likes it. Yeah.

59:27.840 --> 59:31.360
It's interesting cause this is a criterion game and the last big thing I know

59:31.360 --> 59:33.240
they did in the racing world was burnout paradise.

59:33.680 --> 59:36.840
So it's like somebody got burnout in my needs for speed. Now you don't have like

59:36.840 --> 59:38.120
the Epic crashes and all that,

59:38.120 --> 59:41.680
but it is like the whole cop chases back in there and so forth.

59:41.680 --> 59:46.360
But it's more like open world. Um, I like it. It's, it's fun.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.440
It's, you know, kind of,

59:47.440 --> 59:50.320
I like the open world element of it and the, um,

59:50.560 --> 59:53.880
places you can go and do the races and so forth. But, um, I gotta say,

59:54.200 --> 59:56.320
I played another racing game this week that's a little better.

59:56.320 --> 59:59.400
So it's been taking my attention away from need for speed. Most wanted.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.520
And that is sugar rush. No, I wish, uh, no force of horizon.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.560
I've been playing quite a bit of, and it's great. At first,

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.400
I thought I was going to hate it cause I started playing it and I'm like,

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.400
what the hell is this? Like Coachella festival in the middle of Colorado,

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.600
uh, rich spoiled white kids, racing daddy's car and wrecking it.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.200
Like what the hell at hipster bands all over the place. What the hell is this?

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.000
But actually it's they, they, the way they put it together is pretty good. Um,

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.320
I don't like that you can't customize the protagonist at all, but whatever. Um,

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.520
that's really a minor bitch. It's not really about that.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.560
It's about the racing and the racing element is really good. Uh,

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.720
I like the fact that they have it set up with a very flexible difficulty.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.560
You can play this in like racing game for dummy mode and it's great.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.320
Having all the computer easy.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.360
You can have the thing like do the braking for you and there's guidelines,

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.640
all this stuff. Or if you want it to be a little harder,

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.840
you can turn whatever you want on and off.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.160
You can turn the rewind feature off.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.220
You can scale the difficulty of the opponents. You can turn off the line,

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.800
the guideline and GPS thing.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.520
You can turn all that stuff and you get more credits as a reward because of it.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.240
But like the game experience isn't ruined if you use the handicap or whatsoever.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.720
So the way they've implemented the scaling difficulty is really good.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.600
So I have to give kudos for that.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.360
And as much as I joke about the hipster soundtrack,

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.240
it actually is a pretty good soundtrack. So I give props for that as well.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.800
Although my one minor,

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.120
minor bitch is that I hate that the game will not remember what radio station

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.880
I've been listening to. I don't want to switch to the other one, but anyway,

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.840
that's a really minor bitch. Uh, online support. Pretty good.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.240
Did some races with act theft and Bobby the other night.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.520
And we're all in the little VOG club on Forza horizon, which by the way,

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.400
if you have the game request membership to the VOG club, V O G,

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.240
very easy to find. And I'm an officer now so I can promote people or whatever.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.920
So if you want to do that and race with us, it's, it's, it's, it's, I've been,

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.480
I've been meaning to use my racing.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.240
I have a Microsoft racing wheel with the pedals and everything and I have not,

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.240
I've not used it for anything. I got it like a long time ago.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.560
I did not get my ass kicked in online mode as bad as I thought I would. I,

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.760
we played at least seven or eight races. Yes.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.400
I came in last place in a couple of them, but I'm new. I'm allowed to,

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.080
I came in third place on one of them.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.440
Have you painted your car yet?

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.200
Uh, yes. All I've done is paint it, but I've seen the decal thing.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.400
Bobby has a VOG car with like the whole VOG logo with the glowing G.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.040
He emulated that logo very well in Forza horizon.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.480
And the cool thing is you can actually go into the shop and you can search for

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.120
VOG and you can download that for your car if you have the screenprints of that

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.840
to put in my portfolio as the use of the logo. No, that's fine.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.680
That's fine. Talk to Bobby about it. I don't know how to do that. So, uh,

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.480
there you go. And, um,

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.560
actdeft wants to clarify in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby and I,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.320
actdeft are leaders of the VOG club in Forza so you can ask any of us. So yeah,

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.960
well I think you just ask for membership and whatever officer happens to see it,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.440
we'll approve it. So that's all. Um, but um, yeah,

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.720
even though the whole thing is like Colorado,

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.040
they're able to do some very varied environments. Like there's a little city,

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.680
there's some really beautiful,

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.640
like there's a cliffside race that was just like where you're going through

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.480
tunnels and stuff that I was just like, Oh man, this is beautiful. Look at. So,

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.040
um, and yeah, I had a great time with online mode and I love the scaling

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.920
difficulty. It's, it's a great racing game.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.520
It's one of my favorite racing games I played in a very long time. Uh,

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.120
this is probably the first game I've got from the rental service where I'm like,

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.560
yeah, I want, I want to keep this one. I'm going to buy it. I'm going to,

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.840
I'm going to keep it. So yes,

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.960
highly recommend for as a horizon if you're into racing games,

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.560
not like the other fours of games at all. That's very important to say.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.480
It's arcade more style. And I say that's great. I don't know if this is true.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.200
I heard a lot of the people that used to be with bizarre, you know, that made,

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.400
um, the old, uh, fours of games, right? And then they made, um, uh,

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.200
blur was the game that shut down that office unfortunately, which was a tragedy.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.360
But anyway, I hear a lot of them were involved with this anyway.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.560
But I don't know if that's true or not, but I believe it.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.640
I would absolutely believe it. So it's, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's great.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.440
I'm, I'm loving it. So, uh, now,

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.280
now that I've said a lot of good things about it,

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.440
I do need to express one of my kind of complaints.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.800
That's a big exclamation point. And it's not so much about the game itself,

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.160
but it's more about the model and the game industry is in a very interesting

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.400
place right now.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.360
And a lot of people are saying that one of the reasons why the PlayStation Vita

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.120
is really struggling right now is not just the fact that it's the lack of games,

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.280
but the fact that you have these like $40 games on the platform when you can get

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.000
mobile games for 99 cents or a dollar and so forth. But as we all know,

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.480
the way mobile games sustain themselves is that they try to sell all these extra

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.440
things and the add ons, the enhancements to try and, you know, get you to like,

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.680
like tiny tower Alan was talking about earlier.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.480
If you want to get the tower bucks so you can get a nice emulator,

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.600
you can earn those very slowly in game,

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.400
or you can buy them for real, real money.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.120
The reason why I bring that up for is it has a couple of features in it that I

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.040
think are a little bit shady for real money.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.560
And some of that is that you can buy car credits that you can use to basically

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.360
replace the in game currency to buy the cars instantaneously. Um,

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.400
you can buy a cheat map or whatever that shows you all the discount, uh,

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.000
that you, you, one little perk in the game is that as you break certain

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.720
billboards, you increase the level of your discount you get at the upgrade shop.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.040
Well,

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.880
you can buy a map for real money that shows you where all 100 of those discount

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.040
billboards are. So it's like kind of makes game easier.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.440
Or it didn't just go on game facts or something like that and just do the same

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.040
thing for free.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.000
It's all those like in game cheats you can buy and so forth and what have you.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.040
I understand the having different cars as DLC.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.360
I understand that having the horizon rally as DLC, but some of this other stuff,

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.640
it's not that it ruins the game cause you don't have to do it.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.800
I just think it's a little bit tacky,

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.680
especially when it's press right trigger to get it, you know,

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.320
and then pops at the menu and buy.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.440
It's just like quit shoving that shit in my face because it's really tacky to

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.520
ask me to pay 60 bucks for a game or whatever and then do this stuff on top of

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:16.920
it. Now again, I'm just saying I did enjoy the game overall and I didn't pay 60

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.200
bucks for it. I rented it. So maybe in some ways I did,

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.160
I did get it for free and I deserve to have all the stuff shut in my face.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.080
But if I do decide to take the plunge and spend the 40, 50, 60 bucks to get it,

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.400
I just wish the game would stop trying to nickel and dime me after that.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.840
It's like as a developer, I really think you need to choose which road are you

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.000
going to go down? Are you going to charge 60 bucks for a fully featured game?

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.440
Are you going to charge 99 cents for a half ass feature game and try to sell me

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.160
the $50 worth of features? That's my big question about it.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.960
So just saying that's my one little bitch about the thing.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.720
Act Efton chat says, Rob, it's people from bizarre and Codemasters.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.280
That makes a lot of sense actually. So there you go. All right. By the way,

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.480
Jamie, uh, I did also get in the car shop, the decal shop.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.400
Somebody made a car made with N seven sticker on it.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.480
It looks like the Normandy. It's adorable.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.840
Okay. I have to play this now. I thought you might say that. All right. Uh,

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.120
that's it for my gaming week. Uh, I'll leave it at that.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.000
I felt like I played like a lot of games in my downtime and was able to play

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.840
some. Wow.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.480
Yeah.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.920

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.120
There's also a little mini URL that tiger Claude made some time back.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.920
It's like G plus dot T O slash orange on radio or something like that.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.880
I don't know. Anyway, uh, let's get into some actual news.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.000
Loki wants to start us off.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:02.080
So there was, um, a lot of drama with the game war Z, uh,

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.240
you know, it was released on steam and it wasn't very good because it wasn't

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.320
finished yet.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.200
And there was a bunch of this stuff that they had in the product description

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.160
talking about, you know,

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.600
the features of the game and not a lot of that was true.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:22.960
And then it got to the point where it was so bad that valve actually kicked it

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.120
off steam until, you know, the publisher, or I should say the developer,

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.760
fixes all the problems and issues with it. Um,

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.780
so the kind of go along with that now they're having the actual name of the game

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.560
being suspended and the trademark is kind of gone because of the movie world war

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.400
Z, which is going to be coming out in 2013 with the zombie typhoon,

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.720
you know, really weird trailer for that. But, um, yeah, so there, of course,

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.680
you know, the war Z is a little too close to the world war Z and unfortunately

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.680
the war Z filed their trademark request a little after world war Z.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.240
And so because of that, it's most likely going to go to, you know, paramount.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.560
Yeah. So now it's going to be called something else.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.040
I thought when I heard about that game that I was like,

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.760
wasn't there that movie as well? Like I actually did look out for years.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.520
I kind of did think there was a, uh, a link between them. So I have to admit,

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.360
uh, oops, I might not be helping, uh, the game's case here,

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.000
but I kind of did think they were related at first before I read up a little

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.160
more on the game. I finally did figure it out. Yeah.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.080
And unfortunately the game of me looks kind of like a rip off of the daisy. Um,

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.280
if I remember correctly, I think this is actually,

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:45.020
it's another game that has a similar title, like war something.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:49.320
And it's kind of like a zombie mode of that or a zombie mod of that.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.480
But, um, yeah, it kind of sucks.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.440
Another MMO trying to compete in that same franchise.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.200
Is this the same game that has all that fuckery behind it where the steam thing

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.840
was misleading and all that? Yes.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.300
That was where the guy like use, you know,

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.480
called his own fans that were abusing the game or whatever,

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.680
a dirty word and all this stuff. And just like they're just on a kind of on a,

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.280
you know, claiming there's multiple maps.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.600
There's only one claiming that the maps are like 1500 kilometers or whatever.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.000
It's not even close. I'm going to holla back to a 2011 reference,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.280
but it's like if that ocean marketing guy were running a game company,

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.120
like that's just what I have pictured in my mind of like this.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.440
When I read about this guy and his antics with the game is I'm like, Oh my God,

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.840
it's like that ocean marketing crap all over. Yeah. It's just, it's not,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.120
not boding well.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.600
And unfortunately I don't think the game will be able to recover from it because

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.600
by the time that all this stuff is fixed and the final version of the game is

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.120
done, I mean, you probably have the standalone Daisy client, so no,

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.240
no one really cares. Right. I mean, some people cared cause they,

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.840
they bought the game, but unfortunately it's pretty terrible cause you know,

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.760
they never, they never said, Oh, Hey, this is like an alpha, you know,

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.320
they were releasing as a paid game. It just, it's really weird.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.360
Uh, all righty. Well, um,

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.560
let's move on to something completely different that happened this week. You know,

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.840
this is a really slow news week.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.040
Some of the stories you're going to hear tonight are actually from the week we

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.840
didn't have a show cause this past week,

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.800
if we were to, unless we're talking about steam sales,

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.480
in which case there was plenty of news on that. Well, we'll get to that. But um,

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.640
this was a big story that actually happened this week just a couple of days ago.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.000
And you know, it's the end of an era of sorts. Um, PlayStation two,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.640
no more. It's done. At least in Japan,

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.240
the PlayStation two has ceased shipping to Japanese retailers.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.080
Once the current stock of PlayStation two is off the Japanese shelves,

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.040
it is gone. You know, it's the PlayStation two.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.840
The console is literally about 13 years old. You know,

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.040
it's probably one of the longest lasting consoles out of any of them.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.600
It's had a good life, you know,

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.000
but there's a lot of people this week that are like, Ooh, no more PS two.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.040
But I mean, come on guys. There's plenty of them out there. I think the only cast,

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.640
I think the only reason this is actually sad is because not all the PlayStation

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.080
threes are backwards compatible. So what if I need,

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.600
what if my PlayStation two breaks and I need to get a new PlayStation two store?

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.920
I guess that's what you're going to have to do, right? I don't know eBay now.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.160
And they don't say anything about the U S either,

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.080
but I don't think these are exactly easy to find in the U S as it is.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.600
No, they don't. I don't. I mean, they still may sell some new PlayStation twos,

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.040
but I know that they're pretty much done with the games.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.200
Damn you. Konami and pro Evo. So putting it on PS two, I mean,

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.760
that's really a final fantasy chains of anduin or whatever it's called. That's,

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.480
that's, remember we talked about that. That's the last PS two game is on.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.280
Well, you know, that's nice Japanese,

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.200
although it would be interesting to see if they release it over here.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.080
I don't think they did with, uh, wings of a goddess,

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.520
which was the last one that they had out.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.760
I don't know if that came out over here. Maybe it did. I just don't remember.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.880
It was a couple of years ago, but, um,

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.400
I it's had a good run. Yeah, I know. What can you, what else can you say? Like,

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.880
yeah. Oh wow. It's over. This is more just one of those damn.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.440
I'm getting old moments because I look at this going,

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.000
I remember when this thing first came out and now they're no more. Right.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.200
Jamie, I'm rolling my eyes as hard as I can. It may be audible.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.040
Why? Because I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.920
I was actually surprised they were still making PS two games for a while after

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.120
the PS three came out. I mean, yeah, I expected like maybe a year,

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.400
but how long has the PS three been out now? What, two years, three years,

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.320
something like that. Why? It's been more than that.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.480
I'm just, I'm so completely not surprised. It's time for, you know,

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.360
but they're prepping for a next gen system and phasing out the,

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.200
it's almost exactly how it happened with the first PlayStation. Well, yeah,

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.280
it's just, there's no game sink coming out in PS two anymore. It doesn't matter.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.600
The people who are going to have one have one, right?

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.000
I have a first model Japanese PlayStation two works just fine.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.200
Don't need a new one.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.920
I'm going to our chatters who are clarifying some of the Final Fantasy 11 issues.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:07.160
A Shane Alinko says they already said no more Final Fantasy 11 PlayStation two

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.960
expansions in the U S Raginator says wings of the goddess did come out here,

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:16.480
but there won't be any more here in the U S which makes sense. So who cares?

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.560
It's just Final Fantasy 11 anyway. God damn.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.160
There's a lot of newer games you can be playing.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.000
I don't even know. Well,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.200
and the other thing too is I don't even know if that,

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.400
couldn't they do it digitally? I mean,

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:30.080
I know they don't really have anything in sort of in place for PlayStation two,

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.240
but I mean, if you think about it, you could probably just download it.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.720
Cause I know they have those three kind of micro expansions.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.720
Those never really came out as a disc version,

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.720
but they could do something like that. Yeah. You could download it to the hard drive.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.120
I don't know.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.520
Damn. There's so many job classes I was not aware of. I was like, well dude,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.480
what's all this? This is a scholar. I don't know. I'm smart guy.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.160
That's really gonna fight off a goblin.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.840
They're black mages and white mages. They're like gray mages,

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.640
but their thing is that they, they're a great sub job because they can,

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.480
you can do the, um, I forget what the skills call,

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.760
but it's basically you enhance your black magic and weaken your white magic or

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.240
vice versa. They're like a ying yang mage type of thing. So yeah, cool.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.960
And now you know, and now I know and dancers are great for soloing in the,

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.880
in, in, in the end, most say, well, let's, let's,

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.120
let's get to level 20 first because shit,

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.160
I got to go do all that stuff solo now cause I'm not gonna be able to go back to

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.640
play Ragnarok online now. Cause retro is fun. Hey,

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.080
that's why I picked the Ragnarok server.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.600
So it'd be easy for me to remember which one it was. Cause I had a Ragnarok.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.520
Okay, cool. Yeah. Cause Bismarck's gone.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.880
So I don't even know where the hell my character would be anyways,

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.280
even if I re did my old Bard black mage servers.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.160
Yeah. Uh, Flaco, you have fond memories of the PlayStation too.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.160
Yeah. And actually my wife and I were thinking about buying a slim a couple of

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.680
years ago. So we went to fries and you get, I had one, but I mean I have one,

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:58.000
but it was kinda, it's kinda flaky. It doesn't have a great video connection.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.080
It doesn't play. Sometimes it cuts out in the middle of playing a game.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.680
So it's dying and we, uh, she wanted to play Kingdom Hearts too.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.440
And so I was like, well, we're at, we're at fries. Let's just see. What is it?

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.440
Like 20 bucks. It's still a hundred dollars two years ago at least.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.040
Oh wow. I'm not paying a hundred dollars for a PlayStation two.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.040
I saw one at the thrift store for 50.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.800
It's honestly because these older devices, they don't price protect them.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.760
So they're not going to drop the price cause they're losing money.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.280
Cause when they bought them, there was no margin in it anyway.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.120
So they're not going to eat, you know, 50 bucks on a console.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.480
They're just going to let it sit there until someone's dumb enough to buy it for

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.280
that. I mean, that's why you gotta go secondhand.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.880
Yeah. I mean, well I had a used one. That was my whole point. I was like,

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.440
but so we just hooked up the old one and it worked.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.400
My wife beat Kingdom Hearts two again and all was good.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.040
Well, I'm looking at Amazon and you know, they're,

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.200
they're a little scarce to find. I mean,

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.760
they're all from the secondhand sellers and uh,

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.400
$149 new or 130 new, but $50 used or 43 99 used.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.880
So yeah, well mine held up. So that was good. But yeah, I was, I just didn't,

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.400
I had no idea it would be a hundred dollars.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.720
I was thinking maybe 50 would be cool. I thought I was stupidly thinking,

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.640
you know, it should be 20 bucks cause who plays that anymore?

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.600
They need to amp up the backwards compatibility.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.440
I wish they would just fricking do as much software backwards compatibility as

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.400
they can do. I mean, I realize not everything can be.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.240
They're just going to sell them now. Ah, bastards. That's all they're doing.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.920
Well, download games, right?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.840
Maybe that they could sell some more VITAs by doing that. But all right, uh,

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.640
let's move on with some other news. Dark Sakura.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.200
Well, as I was saying earlier, there are steam sales. Yay.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.960
And I mean there's a crap load of sales. Um, there's daily sales,

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.200
flash sales, prolonged discounts.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:48.080
You can basically see a game go on sale every 12 hours. Um,

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.400
not really joking at all.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.720
They're doing like bundle sales like into like 75% off whole game series and

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.240
stuff and you can get steam alerts. And now, um, it's like,

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.840
uh, in fact I just had, um,

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.440
the steam site open just a moment ago, but they had, um,

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.000
hold on, say something, Rob.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:09.640
I was just to say,

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.360
I wanted to check in with everybody on their steam casualties.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.680
What have you given into on this sale so far?

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.980
I picked up, um,

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.720
limbo and closure and um, I picked up,

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.040
uh, what the crap game was that? Oh, Assassin's Creed two. Like I was saying,

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.160
um, Skyrim isn't on a good enough sale yet for me to justify it.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.760
The Bioshock, um, franchise is on sale for 10 bucks.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.160
Check Skyrim again.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.920
It was the daily today or yesterday and that's as low as it's going to get.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.480
And the Bioshock franchise, I'm not going to pay 30 bucks.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.720
Bioshock franchise. Go Amazon. It's five bucks there.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.080
Let's still play it through. Yeah, I hear far cry three.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.560
You can get a better deal on some of the zombies game of the year edition is two

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.200
49 and seriously, if you haven't played that by now, then where,

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.720
what rock have you been under? Mass Effect two right now is five bucks.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.600
Mm hmm. I, uh,

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.120
I bought Gianna sister's twisted dreams cause I wanted it anyway.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.680
The Valve collection is 50 bucks.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.600
That surprisingly is the only game I bought except I will say, uh,

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.480
Alan trying to get the achievement for getting the gift meta thing or getting

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.840
the meta, doing all little meta achievements for the holiday sale.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.360
He gave me a gift of a little dollar 50.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.200
I didn't know they had achievements for sale.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.760
They do anything to get you to buy.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.640
This is another game I'm actually kind of interested in.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.240
It's another two 50 game. It's called the tiny bang story.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.640
One of the indie games. It's,

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.760
it's got some looks like it's some neat puzzle elements in it too. Um,

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:42.480
but back on the mate, like critical mass postal, uh,

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.400
beat hazard. Uh, let's see,

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:50.400
I'm just trying to get the entire Indies super mega pack 30 games is 70 bucks,

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.000
which for all of that. Yeah. Um,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.160
I will probably inevitably get dark souls again when it goes on like super sale.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.800
The far cry franchise is 50 bucks. Not bad market. The Ninja eight bucks,

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.360
the Witcher eight, but which are two eight bucks. Flaco,

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.760
have you given in any of the sales yet?

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.520
I have not, but I already have a lot of those games.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.840
I have limbo and I love Bioshock. I have those and, and uh,

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.560
and I got the humble bundle things. So I was like,

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:23.600
I don't need more games that I'm not going to play because I still need to hook a

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.360
computer up to my TV in the front room because I haven't had that since I

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.960
moved. Hey, instead of five, eight bucks, get that. Cause if five's great,

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.920
I don't really like the sub games, but other people can play them. I,

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.840
you know this about me, here's, here's, here's something.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.220
If you want to get SIV five and some other games they have on Amazon.

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:45.040
See cause I've been doing Amazon because they've everything steam codes and you

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.480
can just redeem it over on steam and they're a little bit cheaper. Yeah.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.400
Shop around for the best bargain. The two K mega pack, which is, um,

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:57.280
I think seven or nine games includes Bioshock to Bioshock borderlands game of

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.720
the year edition, SIV city, Rome, Duke Nukem forever, complete pack mafia twos,

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.800
SIV five game of the year edition,

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.600
SIV for the complete edition and the stronghold collection for 30 bucks.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.560
I don't think I would even accept money to take Duke Nukem forever. Uh,

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.080
act deaf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.600
Loki check your profile and see the badges. That's,

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.120
that's where the holiday sale meta achievements and all that crap is.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.120
Or don't, don't get suckered into that stuff. No. All right.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.120
I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the little mini games this

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.920
year where it's like the little achievements within the games that were tied to

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.320
the holiday. Like they haven't done things like that since last year.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.560
And I liked that. So like I remember last year they had the whole,

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.600
get the pieces of coal and then like you could trade up the coal and get the

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.160
games. I think that was so much better. But I guess, you know,

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.360
beggars can't be choosers. It's awesome. They're doing what they are as it is.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:54.040
So, all right. Um, let's move on with some more news. Uh,

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.120
Loki, I think you're next. All right.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.480
So let's talk a little bit about this thing called Disney infinity that we're

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.720
just hearing about for the first time. What is this Disney infinity?

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.720
But there's rumors.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.720
It's apparently a new gaming initiative that's going to have something to do

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.520
with, uh,

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.340
this thing called toy box that is going to have Disney and Pixar characters

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.620
interacting in games across multiple platforms. And,

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.620
and it's also going to be like, you know, sort of like Skylanders.

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:27.180
And apparently they're going to tell us more about it in, um,

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.260
January. And also I guess it's going to be a sandbox game.

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:34.820
They're saying it's going to be similar to the toy box mode in toy story three.

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:39.720
Um, yeah, it's very interesting.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.720
I wish we had more information about it as if like, you know,

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.880
we had some sort of document or something that, Oh,

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.960
what the hell is this that's in my lap here from like weeks ago that is under a

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.560
pile of cords and stuff. It's a document about Disney infinity. That's so weird.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.400
So weird.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.560
Let's see here.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.380
Introducing a new game platform takes you to an infinite game possibilities and

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:04.800
beyond.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.360
Imagine bringing together your favorite Disney and Disney Pixar heroes stories

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.000
and locations as toys to create your own unique customized environments,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.480
adventures, and stories just the way you want them.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.160
Now you can with Disney infinity, the possibilities are infinite,

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.880
but it sounds like the game itself may not be like, you know,

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.720
we know it's inspired by Skylanders,

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.000
the whole like real life figures and this whole thing,

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.640
but it's not that the game itself may not necessarily be Skylanders because

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.760
Skylanders is apparently very Diablo. Yeah.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.600
I think it is going to be kind of more like the toy box mode because they're

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.880
talking about, okay, so some of the stuff that they're going to, you know,

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.520
be tying in with, it's mainly gonna be a lot of movie tie-ins and stuff.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.840
So for example, since this game is supposed to be coming out around June,

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:47.700
you're going to have like the first few things, the monsters,

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.800
university Pixar's or cars.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.960
I say they're doing cars, 3d or something like that. The lone ranger,

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.640
the Incredibles. I think that's also getting like a 3d treatment as well.

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:02.240
Toy story, parts of the Caribbean.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.320
And they're saying the different types of things like they're going to have

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.240
gadgets, buildings, vehicles, environments, et cetera.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:15.720
Basically the way they have it work is each character's got a character coins

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.880
and like a place at pieces and they kind of put,

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:21.320
they get put down on this reader and then when you put them on the reader,

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.000
it unlocks game content, but they are actual figures.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.800
They're not there. They're their actual figures.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.360
Actual reader is actually kind of the same shape as the infinity logo or the in

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.280
that they have in the infinity logo. It's like this weird like, yeah,

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.120
it's this weird, like uneven hexagon thing, um, that they've got there.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.360
At least that's in the little, um, little thing. And yeah,

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:48.640
it's a apparently, yeah, it says open world, innovative game design,

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.320
triple a quality game, uh,

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.720
complete line of interactive game pieces supporting all platforms,

01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.240
supports all T, uh, TWDC events. Um,

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.040
so yeah. Um, we, it looks like it'd be interesting. I mean,

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.560
more interesting as Skylars, that's for sure, but whatever.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.840
Cause it's Disney and you know,

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.080
you know people are going to fucking eat this shit up and it's because, um,

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.920
it's, I mean, look at just like the crap that people come.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.880
I'm a little worried about Flaco. Not only is he a Disney addict,

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.720
like the rest of us, but he has kids and he can justify, Oh, it's for the kids.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.640
I know if my kids, if my kids want Skylanders, I'll be like, no,

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:32.920
but if you want something similar, you can get Disney. I'll be fine with that.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:37.920
You know? So yeah, I mean, uh, it'll be interesting, but yeah.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.360
Will you find an excuse to go to Disneyland just because they have a limited

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.640
edition character that you can only get like in the park?

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.880
Cause you know that shit's going to happen. I'll go anyway. I don't care.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.040
Well anyways,

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.000
you'll be hearing it from the rest of the game blogs in January because they're

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.800
all sort of embargo or some bullshit, but you know what?

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.880
No fucking embargoes on this train

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.480
because no one shares information with us. All right. Fair enough.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:07.760
It's just Disney infinity. It's not Fort Knox. We all know what's coming.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.000
There it is. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's talk about,

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.760
let's go from Disney to talking about pornography, shall we?

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:19.640
Yay. Well, that's an easy segue. I'm suddenly reminded of this, this, uh,

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.320
GIF I saw of the wicked queen from snow white and she's,

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.000
she's holding this open box and she has the scowl on her face and the little

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.720
capture says, who put a dick in this box? That was awesome. Yeah, that's great.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.280
Anyway. Uh, let's talk about porn. Uh,

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.920
porn found on a three DS and was traded into GameStop.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.160
Oh boy. Yes. Uh, let's see.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:44.840
This is actually a report from the daily mail. Uh, they got this,

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.840
I guess a refurbished Nintendo three DS had nine pornographic images on it and

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.120
was, uh, yet traded into GameStop. Oh wait, does this,

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.760
does this link to a local news story? It does.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.560
I got to do that cause it looks like it's channel nine news here in the States.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.280
Oh, I gotta find this. Where? Yes.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.840
We get to hear sensationalist local news. I love sensations.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.200
Let's hear sensationalist local news. Tell the story.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.000
Who can take a small problem and just blow it way out of proportion.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.440
Local news. We need a bumper for local news that just distorts everything.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.280
All right, here we go. Local news on porn.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.360
I don't want to hear zip ties.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.600
I love zip ties. Tell me more blowing zip ties out of proportion.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.040
Dude, did they have like a shop that's dedicated to zip ties?

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.520
Because that's fucking awesome. I want to know more zip ties.

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.600
Your long zip ties, your small zip ties, your colored zip ties.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.160
You know what? What the hell? It's, it's apparently that's the city.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.560
It's a store called a to Z and it has everything from

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.560
zip ties.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.360
People who like work with a lot of chords and people who want to murder people.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.520
All right. Local news time. Shut up.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:01.800
New tonight,

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.440
a father from Lakewood had to return one gift that was given his son.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.560
He says it traumatized his family.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.920
The five year old boy found pornographic pictures on the refurbished game device

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.920
he got for Christmas. Nine news reporter,

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.400
Megan Fitzgerald joins us from the GameStop where the item was purchased.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.480
Megan, the company says it's trying to make it right. Adele,

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.520
that's what they're saying. But the dad just does it. Wait, the reporter,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.080
the, the lady's name is Adele. Is that, did I,

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.640
she's that fired their name. Did I hear that correctly?

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.280
Is the news lady's name Adele? You know, people are named Adele by the way.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.760
Let's go outside the GameStop and watch this guy. Oh, watch.

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.600
See how that's possible since you can't just erase these images from his son's

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.960
brain, but the store behind me. But he's tried.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.480
If the family, a brand new upgraded Nintendo 3d ass,

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.080
they also threw in some games in there,

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.440
but the dad says there's really no way to make this right.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.760
He just wants to let other families know. So it doesn't happen to their kids.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:06.600
When you're a kid, hands down the best.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.480
That's the name of the electric buzzsaw, by the way,

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.560
trying to get into the kid's brain. I'm kidding. It's a toy tank.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.880
Part about Christmas is jumping out of bed.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.800
It's really exhilarating and seeing all the toys.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.960
Especially when you're five.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.560
And especially when you've been waiting all year round for that special toy.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.560
I get a 3d. Yeah, you got a 3d. Yes, that's right. And these are some,

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.000
these are the pictures that we took this morning. There's Brayden,

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.200
but Wednesday morning, that excitement turned to horror.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:39.840
He ended a 3d S to Brighton and Brian said, dad,

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.440
I don't think he should be looking at these pictures.

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.720
I don't think we should be looking at these pictures. It's just a DS.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.000
It's not a 3d S. It's just exactly like a DS. You are five.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.960
You shouldn't be looking at those pictures because don't you read the warning

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.880
that you're not supposed to play it when you're under seven or you're going to

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:59.080
go cross. Did you hear that? I said, dad,

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.840
this DS has porn on it.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.320
And I handed him the DS and he just got up and are they all crying?

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.400
Hold on. Hold on. First world problems. First world problems. Hold on.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.080
And the kid is crying. How does the kid know what porn is?

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.320
How does the first thing he said was this has porn on it and doesn't know what

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:20.760
porn is.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.760
Because I would think that a five year old isn't probably going to know what

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.160
that stuff is and all those people are being silly expert, AKA a mom.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.800
Does, does your son know what porn is?

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.800
Um, this whole thing really? I'm,

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.080
I'm allegedly in my opinion, this themes,

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:42.320
things seems like it's being set up for a lawsuit.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.840
Yeah. Look good on camera guys. Make sure you're crying. And,

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.040
and they told the kid what to say. Cause yeah, yeah.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.880
There's poured on the DS daddy. Hmm.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.640
I'm asking Becky even fifth dream in chat.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.800
Why does a five year old know what porn means to the phone? Oh, I lost it.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.880
I, I just called everybody.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:05.840
Really?

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.920
It was hard for Mark Giles as two young sons to see pornographic images on their

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.560
toy. Now look,

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.560
I get if somebody is like super religious or whatever and is offended by the

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:21.960
side of porn and so forth and just does and the fact that like a kid saw it,

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.560
because you know, as much as we're, we're laughing to have a good time with it,

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.840
it is fucked up that a kid, you know,

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.680
that didn't want to be subjected to it got subjected to it. But I'm sorry,

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:33.640
this is way over the top for me. But you know what? So here's not angry.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.720
You know, it's even worse about it.

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:37.840
Hate the spoiled part of the story here that we're probably gonna get to here.

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.840
I think he said it was from Santa Claus.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:42.760
Okay.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.840
That was a gift from Santa Claus. There's another one.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.840
I can't be mature about it. I can't be there. There's another one.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.000
There was another one that I saw too that wasn't necessarily this,

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.400
but it was one of those where you buy stuff from Walmart as a returned item and

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.240
in the box instead of a 3ds it was rocks.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:07.600
That's great. Okay. So I asked Becky for the sake of the show,

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:11.200
does Julian know what porn is? And I did at the end.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:16.840
And she says no in big bold letters with four exclamation points and then

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:20.160
lol. But it was even harder for him.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.680
And then I said, um, we know what was going on. And she said, weird.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.720
So that's coming from a mom with a five year old just saying, all right, let me,

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.760
let me let these sensationalist local news courtesy of nine news finish up here

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.720
who tried so hard to make Christmas special about nine minutes,

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:45.440
nine images of a sexual activity on his

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:49.800
toy that he got from Santa that Santa got from GameStop.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.000
So GameStop tried to make it right.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:56.120
They told Giles the images were from a previous owner and they weren't caught

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:58.520
before the refurbished device was sold.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.080
But you can't unsee this. He's five years old.

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.520
Now maybe when he's 18 or 20 and maybe he won't know anything about the kids are

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.000
hugging right now in the little,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.920
they're showing a picture of the kids has no freaking clue what's going on,

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.320
comforting each other about this horrific imagery.

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:15.760
He's not going to forget about it tomorrow.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.720
And the company wouldn't go on camera,

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:21.300
but the corporate office sent us the following statement.

01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:25.560
It says GameStop is currently researching the situation.

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:29.720
We have a rigorous quality control process in place to ensure that existing

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:34.720
content is removed from all devices before they are resold out of millions of

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.200
transactions each year. One's like this happened very rarely.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.080
Our number one priority is to make this right for our customers.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:46.080
Degenerate Johnny in our chat room says ROFL Santa shops at the evil G

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.960
and an employee at the GameStop behind us told Giles that they're going to do

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.640
their own investigation to try and find out how this happened to Dell so that

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:56.960
they can make sure it doesn't happen again.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.840
I'm kind of curious, Megan, is this type of a bulk eraser?

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.360
It would seem like that you would erase everything on every unit.

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.520
You would think so, Adele.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.960
In fact the father was saying that there was a SIM card that easily could have

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.080
just been removed that would have, uh, erased all of these images.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.760
But unfortunately that wasn't the case.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.720
Of course we weren't going to show those images because they were very

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.880
graphic. But again, the company is saying that they,

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.680
they try and catch things like this,

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:25.960
but this one obviously slipped through the cracks obviously. All right,

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.160
Megan distro. Thanks Megan.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.840
Really? Really? They're going to launch an investigation to it. Like, Oh,

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:35.800
some dickhead forgot to like erase this thing is with the way that GameStop

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.720
functions. Probably half that store is fired because they'll know seriously.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:42.880
You're right. Probably because they fire their employees.

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.280
They make up shit to fire their employees over. I'm not lying.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.160
I don't think that, I don't think that that story to get fired. Cause anything,

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.880
any systems that they take back for refers to get sent away to this is,

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.280
there's a reason why there's a reason why they're called evil G Loki.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.960
They fire people for the tiniest of little reasons. I know people personally,

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.280
why do you think my husband quit?

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.120
Act deft in our chat room says they could have had the porn,

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.880
but they're rolling in the deep. All right, forget it. Look, I, it is a,

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.240
it is a crappy situation. I think that is way over the top.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.560
The way everybody's reacting. It's like, okay, you know,

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.320
it's obvious what happened. It is wrong. GameStop should say, Hey, whoops,

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.400
we didn't erase this one. You know, but at the same time, I kind of wonder like,

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.960
how did,

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.680
did the parents not think to look first before handing the system to their five

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.240
year old? I mean,

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:40.240
he says I went to go take the picture and I handed it to the five year old.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.800
How did, I'm trying to think like in having used the DS,

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.040
how did he not see the pictures first then? So I don't get,

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.200
you're the parents in the room.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.520
My kid would not know what porn is when he's five.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.120
And I don't think you even know what he was looking at. What's that?

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.360
Exactly. I think that's what happened. That's why mine have happened.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.080
And then he decided, Oh, I'm going to get a case going.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.720
So this is what you say to the reporters kids,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.280
because I feel like the kids know what he saw in my opinion, in my opinion.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.720
This is what I think as I honestly think that it's parents thinking other people

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:17.480
are doing their due diligence for them. Honestly, they say, Oh,

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.280
it's coming in. We believe that, you know, we're not going to check.

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.720
We wouldn't think about this. You know, if they were,

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:25.680
if it was something that they were truly worried about,

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.480
then they would have gone through it to begin with.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.920
And let's be honest, this is a 3DS camera, man. I'm luck.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.520
He's lucky to even know what's going on there because that camera is such a

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.000
piece of shit that like, you'd be like, what is that? That there,

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.080
I don't even know what's going on, man.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.400
Those two blobs are really close to each other. I mean, it's just, who knows?

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.400
I just remember hearing from my little brothers,

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.480
mommy and daddy are wrestling again.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:56.280
Or, or, or even better, you know, if they did shoot it very well, you know,

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.240
it's like, Oh my God,

01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.680
it's like my eyes are literally being raped by the penis coming out and taking

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:04.960
3d. All right. Look, a tiger call in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.040
GameStop needs to double check their stuff.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:11.040
I don't think any of us are doubting that, but you know, and I'm not,

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.960
I'm not exactly like giving them a break, but it's like,

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.680
I see how this happened. Christmas rush. Someone got lazy.

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.320
It slipped through. Doesn't make it right. But that's what happened clearly.

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:26.080
Or sometimes if you use, um, a mass, um, formatter for a card,

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:30.000
I've seen it happen where even for, um, camera and phone Sims, they'll,

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.560
they won't do shot better. Yeah.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.480
What about the guy that returned that in the first place? I mean, don't you,

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.640
I mean, honestly, if it was me returning something, I wouldn't be like, Hey,

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.280
I'm gonna pull my porn on there and leave it on there. You know,

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.840
it's just like, you know, when I sold my 3ds on eBay,

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.960
I erased all the porn that I had on there.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.400
Not anything that I actually photographed, but like you can download, you know,

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.840
stuff that actually goes on your card that has, you know,

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.880
picture sets and stuff like that.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.920
People shot with professional 3d cameras that aren't shit like the, you know,

01:37:58.920 --> 01:37:59.800
3ds cameras.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.800
I think this is a good point that shadow next gen says in our chat room, uh,

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.480
Walmart does a worse job than GameStop.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.720
It's probably very true. Uh, you know,

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:14.440
a company that doesn't specialize in game, you know,

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.560
they have a game department, but they don't specialize in games.

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.360
It's probably far more likely to make that mistake. Uh,

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.720
act deft closing up the story saying that kid should feel privileged.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.640
He had 3d porn. He just didn't realize it yet. I do all the time.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.920
He's observing the future. Speaking of Nintendo porn,

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.880
a good segue for me to mention this, a porn app coming to the Wii U sugar DVD.

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.880
They offer unlimited adult TV streaming on the PlayStation three iPad,

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.320
Xbox three 60 and so forth.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.080
They've announced that they're bringing their app to the Wii U unlimited

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.600
streaming porn straight to the game console, seven 95 a month.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.560
And you're probably thinking, wait a minute, how did they do this?

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.120
Like I don't know this porn app on the PS three and so forth.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.000
It's launched through the web browser.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.720
So in other words, that's not much of an app.

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:04.160
It's a website that you pay for to just get it formatted.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.720
It's like, oh, things in app to be fair.

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.040
It it's probably looking at the user agent and stuff like that and formatting

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.320
to their site. Cause I actually have the sugar DVD app on. Uh,

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:18.560
it was course you do. No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Let, let me be clear.

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.360
Let me be clear. I don't pay for porn. Okay. So, okay.

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.000
So I had the app on, it came, you know,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.200
it's part of the repository for the boxy. Um, and so they have it, you know,

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.560
and of course I downloaded all the porn apps and seen, you know, I was like,

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:36.640
ah, got paid for this. Fuck that. Delete. But, um, you know, they had it.

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.760
And so, yeah, a lot of it's thing with the boxy,

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.920
the way the boxy works is it's just, you know, websites, uh,

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.960
formatted for those devices. So yeah, I mean,

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.440
I could see that they would do that. Um, and of course, Nintendo go, oh,

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.960
we don't officially do this. By the way,

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.840
the internet Explorer browser on the three 60 sucks for viewing porn.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.920
Just saying porn reviews by Loki. You're on,

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.440
you got to know which browser is good because it doesn't support flash.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:08.040
Who the fuck doesn't support flash nowadays? All right, uh,

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.520
let's go to dark Sakura. We're already,

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.280
we're almost to two hours for party alone.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.680
Let's try to run through the rest of the work until 1130 tomorrow. Right. Um,

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.560
to work on new year's Eve. That sucks. Yeah, but my boss won't be there.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.760
No, that's money. Yeah, money. That's, that's the thing. Money. Um, so anyway,

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:28.040
well we've been talking and talking about this and I knew it was going to

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:32.160
happen and I'm so happy steam for Linux beta is out. Yes.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.760
And I happen to be running Linux. I'm going to test it out.

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.880
Um, basically all you have to do is, um,

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.720
if you don't already have a steam account,

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:46.320
you can install and register and you're in so anyone can be there.

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.240
There's 39 games on there right now. Um, killing floor, um,

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.800
the book of unwritten tales and amnesia are there

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.160
and I'm actually trying to see if, uh,

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.880
I can get into the site there to see what else is on.

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.520
But I mean still, you know, it's a start.

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.880
I think that's actually really cool and I like Linux.

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.120
I may, uh, not have to keep using a PC anymore.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.840
So yeah, if you're interested in it, just play and you know,

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.840
what's great is that steam big picture thing.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:26.520
It really does kind of just make it look like an Xbox is great. Hmm. 3d deck.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:34.360
How could you talk about that? I'm traumatized.

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.920
I'm going to see boobs.

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:41.960
I could say the sea bomb.

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:46.640
Did you notice also when he said when they found that I called everybody I could

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.800
think of. Yeah. The news,

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.920
your lawyer is no games.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:00.000
But I did make sure to transfer the pictures before we gave it back. Stop.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:00.880
All right,

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:06.000
let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a GameStop near

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:06.820
you.

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:14.840
Boobies 3d. Not a damn thing. Nothing in the U S this week.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.360
Nothing in the U S nothing for people to spend their gift certificates on.

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.400
Huh? Steam sale.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.240
That's the savior of gamers. That's all you get this week. Nothing new.

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.440
It's just all steam stuff until, um, till the eighth,

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.680
uh, going to Japan and checking out the releases there.

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.720
Xbox three 60 nothing. PlayStation three,

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.040
nothing. PlayStation Vita. Nothing.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.640
The games don't start really coming in again until January 17th.

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:46.840
It looks like actually, uh, looking at the Wii U nothing.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.720
God doesn't look like there's hardly anything coming out.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.240
Yeah, exactly. Uh, uh, yeah,

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.480
it looks like it is totally dry in Japan as well.

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.880
So enjoy the games you have right now. I do notice though,

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:02.080
there is on PlayStation two Neopets, the darkest fairy. Oh,

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:05.560
that's a Europe game. It's a Europe game.

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.760
That snuck my way onto the Japanese releases. All right. How about,

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.720
how about Europe?

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:13.720
Nothing until the 11th, but one of them's a Wii U game. Rob.

01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:18.000
What's that? Ninja Gaiden three. Okay. Ninja Gaiden three.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.560
Why did I even say it wrong? I don't know. I don't know. I was thinking of porn.

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.400
Yeah.

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.800
Three cock.

01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.080
We were at target just a couple of days before Christmas and uh,

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:32.160
they had like 12 we use there. That's just the one up in Yuba city.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.640
A tower of fries. Yeah, they're everywhere. And yeah,

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:36.640
they don't ship any to us.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:41.000
It's everywhere. 1200 on back order with Nintendo.

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:44.040
They ship us 12. You know, it would have fuck them. You know,

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:48.640
it would have sold them Africa, Tokyo jungle.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.400
All right. I need, I still need to play that. Uh,

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.280
Loki myself have some stories and we're going to go to the last game of the

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.480
week. Loki. Uh, see here.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.960
So this is kind of interesting. You know,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.480
there was that documentary about Minecraft called the story of Mojang and is a

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.520
two player productions.

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:11.320
They decided to go ahead and beat the Russian upload at the pirate bay

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.960
themselves. So they, um, uploaded the pirate bay. Um,

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.480
people can download it for free. They kind of, you know, said, Hey, listen,

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:20.760
you know, we wanted to be,

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:24.280
we wanted to come here first because we knew the movie would eventually end up

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.320
here. And the best thing to do that seems to be opening a dialogue,

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.080
torrents and piracy are way of life and it probably won't be going away anytime

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:35.760
soon. And there are many people that want to punish you for that,

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:40.800
but we have more realistic outlook on things. And they basically said, you know,

01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.440
if you download it, you know,

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.520
we're just three guys trying to make a living on what we're doing.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.760
We love the world of video games and we love making it real.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.880
If you buy the movie, you support those efforts.

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:52.640
The reason we kickstarted this movie in the first place was that we didn't have

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.040
enough money to make it ourselves.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.360
Even then we still put a lot of our own money into it.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.960
So they're just hoping that, you know, people do buy it.

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.040
You know, I did play Minecraft.

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.560
Fantastic. And you know, it's ironically enough,

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.600
I did not play Minecraft this week. Really? Well, I, I actually,

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:12.680
I think I went in for a little bit cause I was fixed last week.

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.280
I was fixing the servers cause I had screwed up the permissions by not installing

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:20.080
the permissions client. So I kept changing the config file. I was wondering,

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:24.400
why the fuck is nothing changing then? Oh, I forgot to reinstall it.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.040
That's funny. You know, so I was trying to do that install flans mod,

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.040
but flans mod may not be coming.

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:36.040
I really wanted it to happen cause that's planes, cars and guns.

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:40.760
But so I can shoot one of those scary gray guys with the bow and arrow in the

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.160
face. Yeah, you can do that now.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:47.080
But I'm talking about actually guns like AK47s.

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:53.760
I, my, my little girl, cause I failed to skin for her, um,

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:57.000
is making herself, um, a prairie dog town to live in.

01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.400
I'm surprised you didn't find like a shepherd model for your Minecraft

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.720
character. I'm going to make one. I'm Zangief.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.880
Mine's just like some whatever girl one is, but I'm making a shepherd for mine.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.000
I did manage to update what I have. I'm doing the vog-minecraft.com.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.320
Actually has, it has a WordPress thing installed on it.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.480
I haven't bothered to update yet. I'm like starting so many projects.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.400
I have another project that may be 2013 that I'm not really going to talk about

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.920
right now, but hopefully it'll be interesting. But, uh,

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.440
the website is another thing I want to update.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.640
So eventually I'll get around to that. But yeah. Um, let me ask,

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.640
let me go back to the story about leaking your own damn film onto the pirate

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.080
bay. Let me ask our film guy.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.480
Obviously piracy is a bit of a problem in Hollywood, right? Yes. Um,

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.400
especially when you talk about other countries, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah.

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.600
It's a much bigger over there.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:48.800
You can go to another country and just get any movie you want. Really.

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:52.040
You can probably go to the theater and see a movie that was pirated. Probably.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:55.000
Yeah. Uh, what do you think about uploading your own movie to the pirate bay?

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:59.840
I don't think it's a bad idea for a movie like this because what other exposure

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.560
are they going to get?

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.160
Maybe a lot of documentaries sign Netflix deals and I don't know how that works.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.320
I don't know how the money transaction works,

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.080
but if these guys put it up on the pirate bay and they put like, like Loki said,

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.000
a message on there saying, Hey, please give us money. People might donate to that.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.920
The guilt thing. What is it? It's not even really a guilt thing.

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:19.960
It's more of like, you know, Hey, you know,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.840
they're actually coming out and saying, Hey,

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:24.320
it's almost like you if they did the pay what you want model,

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:27.040
which actually probably would have been a better way to do it. But you know,

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.680
once again, people are always going to pirate stuff.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.920
They did some similar with McPixel was a game that got put onto the pirate bay

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.920
and he actually,

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.280
he uploaded it to the pirate bay and basically said, okay, you know,

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.680
we're going to do this. You know, you pay me what you want for it.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.320
I think it's worth $5, but you know, you tell me what you,

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.880
what you think it's worth and you pay me that or nothing. And so I,

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:52.960
from what I remember, I think he made actually quite a bit of money from that.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.440
Um, you know, it turned out very well and I think that's kind of the way it seems

01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:57.920
like, you know,

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.600
a lot of these pay what you want things like the humble bundles and stuff do

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.840
really well and they get probably a lot more money than they would have if they

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.120
try to sell everything individually. Um,

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.440
act depth in our chat room at live.vog network.com says it's not guilt.

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.520
It's supporting something you like. Fair enough. And, and I haven't watched it,

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.400
but the trailer looked really good for it. I mean,

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.320
it looked like a pretty awesome documentary. It's nice.

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.880
I still need to watch the indie game movie from the humble bundle that I have.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.520
I wanted to watch that anyway. So, Hmm. All right, well, uh,

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:29.640
let me get one more story here for you guys and we'll get to the classic game of

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.200
the week. But, um, you know, the Wii U game tank tank tank,

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.640
which actually is based on an arcade game,

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.480
which is funny that you're so excited about it because the games were getting

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:40.720
shit reviews left and right. Like people do not like it.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:43.120
I don't care about the Wii U when I care about the arcade one,

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:43.960
which is awesome.

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:45.720
But you know,

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:48.800
I guess trying to sell an arcade game for 60 bucks like that,

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.800
like something you're used to playing a quarter for and getting your,

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.320
or maybe a little quarter. Yeah. This day and age,

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.640
four quarters for to get your five minute throw and then you're done with it.

01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.080
You know, trying to get somebody to pay 60 bucks. That might be asking a lot. Um,

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.400
and I guess in Japan it hasn't been selling well.

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:07.040
Here's kind of an interesting thing that Namco is doing. This is only Japan,

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:07.920
but who knows?

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.520
It could happen here because I don't think it's selling that any better here.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.200
Tank tank tank is now free to play in a way.

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.680
It's kind of a different type of model.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.880
You download the upgradeable demo in the Japanese Nintendo eShop.

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.960
So what you can do if you're in Japan, you download this demo,

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:27.240
you get the basic action game for free. It has multiplayer.

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.080
You can do the city map free for all team battle giant monster,

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:35.160
but if you download the free version, you can only play it three times a day.

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.840
That restriction is removed.

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:39.680
If you purchase any download content for the game,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.680
if you want to get more parts of this upgradeable demo,

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:45.920
you have to get these offered download contents in the game.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:51.160
This is very iPhone. The way this is working out here,

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:56.120
like the, all it is the whole playing it three times daily.

01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:00.720
That's your little three energy pills. And if you want more energy pills,

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:03.440
go buy them on the store or whatever. Like this is just,

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:08.480
this is literally the iPhone pricing model on a launch

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:11.720
title for the game. Now in the Nintendo Wii U shop. Very interesting.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.920
I'm a little cautious with Namco doing it because remember Ridge Racer on the

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.800
Vita and how wonderful that was, you know?

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.360
Well, you kind of hope that maybe they learned something from that whole

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:21.520
experience.

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.120
I certainly hope so because God, that was,

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.040
that was a fucking mess. Um, but Tang Tang Tank's pretty awesome.

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:30.920
But yeah, looking at,

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:33.600
I can see why the reviews haven't been that good on it because it seemed like

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.120
the game was very limited as what they, what they're offering.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.720
Cause I mean in an arcade game it would be, it makes sense that, okay,

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:44.960
you get like maybe an hour of entertainment out of it if you're really playing a

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.200
lot of money into it. But you know, this is a console game,

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:50.080
so you've got to have a lot more to it.

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.600
Otherwise you're going to get really bored. Um, so I don't know.

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:58.800
It's, which reminds me, I need to really go back and play a, that was it,

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:02.720
uh, say a gun game. Uh,

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:05.880
what was that called? I don't remember now.

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:07.560
Say good gun game. Yeah.

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:11.240
There is a Sega gun game that I was really raving about a while back. It's an old,

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:14.560
uh, it's not, not super old. It's not one of the virtual games. It's uh,

01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:20.040
God, I can't fucking remember now. It's just a really wacky game. Um,

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.000
all right, well maybe somebody in chat will read your mind. Um,

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:28.160
but I think this makes a very interesting sort of compliment to the last story

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:31.080
you talked about. I mean they may not be putting tank tank tank up on the pirate

01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.760
bay, but essentially they're putting it on a place where they're saying, Hey,

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:37.720
download it for free and let's see what happens because I bet you a lot more

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.040
people now will play tank tank tank go squad.

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:43.080
It was the game I was thinking of pretty cool. It's, but see,

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:45.800
that game has a lot of replay. I mean it's a very short game,

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:48.840
but you unlock weapons and the weapons increase the difficulty.

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:53.120
And so it was fun. Let's go back to my point though, is that, you know,

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.160
way more people are going to play this game than probably would have before.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.440
Right? Yeah, because now it's free and so are basically checking out and there's

01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:03.760
going to be maybe a handful of people like, Oh yeah, this is kind of fun.

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.120
And I probably wouldn't have bought this, but you know what?

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.440
And even though the three times,

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:12.160
I understand why they're limiting the gameplay cause they're giving you quite a

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:16.280
bit of the game and that seems kind of lame even though it is a demo and stuff.

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:19.880
But I understand why they're doing that. But at the same time, it's,

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.640
it's kind of cool that they are offering that.

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:25.040
So a lot more people can actually check out the game.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.880
A fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says these days wait three

01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:33.360
months to buy a game and you can spend the same amount to get the add ons.

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:37.640
They're like $60 worth of costumes and DOA five worth.

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.920
That's how much they cost. So not worth that.

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:44.160
I did that for, um, puzzle bobble on iPhone.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:45.880
It just saying,

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.760
and also the three times a day is way better than when they limit it to like 30

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:53.400
plays done. You know, that type of thing. Rayman legends.

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:56.040
Haven't forbid if they did that to the Nino Cooney demo. I mean,

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.680
Flaco would have worn it out by now.

01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.480
I already have worn it out.

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.920
All right, so there you go. Tank tank tank going free to play in Japan.

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.200
Who knows? Keep an eye on the news that that could happen here.

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.480
Especially if they have success with it in Japan. We'll see. All right,

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:13.600
let's travel back to a time when you know what? There was no free to play.

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.600
You, you paid the 50, 60 bucks for this game and either you liked it or F you.

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:25.800
Yay. I'm in chat. Oh, did, did the G line get lifted? Yeah.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.000
That's been an hour. We should be able to safely reconnect to chat.

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:34.760
All right. Someone tell, no, we can't all five do it. No, I mean,

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.320
that's all right. I'll just be on my phone. My phone. Fine.

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:46.560
The classic name of the week is Jairus.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:53.520
You mean I have a YouTube of it. I know, but I always have to,

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.760
it's so freaking cool.

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.280
I love this game.

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:15.440
You know, play to cut and you can be minor Rob one. Exactly.

01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:24.560
So Jairus is a shoot him up game that if you've

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:26.040
played, um, Tempest,

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:31.040
you may find the game play style very familiar because you go in a circle.

01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.360
It was the last game that Yoshiki Okamoto did for Konami. Um,

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.800
the first one being time pilot and, um,

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.520
he was fired after the game was released and he went to doing Capcom where he

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:45.080
gave us, Oh,

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:50.080
just a couple of little obscure titles like 1942 and street fighter,

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:55.560
you know? So, um, this one basically you're moving around in a circle,

01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.800
hence I guess Jairus and shooting things as they come from the background to

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:02.340
the foreground. Like I said,

01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:06.760
I'm again comparing it to Tempest because I think that Tempest was, uh,

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:11.400
definitely inspired by that. So, um,

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.680
and also, like I said, that it actually, um,

01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.920
does play an arrangement of Takata and Fuegan D minor,

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:23.440
which I'm sure the Vanessa Mae fans in chat recognize that one from her version

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.240
of it, if not, you know, actually paying attention to classical music, you know?

01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:31.120
So, um, it was, uh,

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.520
actually using stereo sound and, um,

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:37.520
in the bonus material that's for the Konami arcade classic,

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:41.480
they said that they used it by, um, using different, um, audio circuits.

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:42.920
The game was, uh,

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:46.520
used a multi-core processor that had two Z80 microprocessors,

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.680
a 6809 microprocessor and an 8039 microprocessor.

01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:56.160
For the sound, it used an AY3-8910 PSG sound chip and a DAC.

01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.000
For those who are into the technical side of it.

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.680
So again, it's a cylinder,

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:06.440
you shoot stuff when they come at you, you've got, you know,

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.040
swirly things that come at you. Um, if, uh,

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.480
you don't get the enemies in time,

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.120
the enemies that you have are satellites,

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.120
asteroids and laser beam generators,

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:20.720
and they just show up and some of them disappear if you don't shoot them first.

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.960
So, uh, for, uh, other things you have with the asteroids,

01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:29.120
they actually fly out from the center, um, relatively, you know,

01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:33.440
regularly and you still have to shoot them. Then you actually get, um,

01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:34.880
a, uh,

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.480
you have to like make it to different planets as you're going through the

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:43.040
different stages. So you'll, um, like at first it says two warps to Neptune's,

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:46.520
you have to go through a warp and each warp is your stage. And then, um,

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.920
after you land on the planet,

01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.920
you get a bonus round where you have to shoot different ships for bonus points,

01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.480
kind of like, um, Galaga or Galaxian.

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:59.200
And you basically go through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and finally Earth,

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.440
where you've got three warps to get to each planet. Stage one,

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:04.200
and every 10th stage afterwards,

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.240
the enemies will not fire on you when you enter the screen.

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.680
Guess what the video just said? What? One warp to Uranus.

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:17.880
So as far as its arcade release, um,

01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.720
it had an upright and cocktail cabinets, cocktail machines are the best I swear.

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:27.000
It, um, saved the high scores in RAM. Um,

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.280
but there was a mod kit that was released on August 22nd, um,

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:34.680
2003 that would save the top five scores after the machine was powered off.

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.480
So you could actually save the score machine.

01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.600
That would be a great name for a video game blog. Three warps to Uranus.

01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:44.240
I'm sorry. Patent pending.

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:47.480
Jairus was, um,

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:48.120
if we ever,

01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:50.640
if we ever go our separate ways and have to make new podcasts,

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:53.280
my next podcast can be called three warps to Uranus.

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:57.880
Jairus was ported to different early systems.

01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.560
There was a version on Atari, 2650, 200, which I think I've got that one.

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:07.600
The, um, Atari eight bit, the Commodore 64 Rob and the clique of vision.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.040
Can we hear the awesome Commodore 64 SID chip version of Takata?

01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:14.280
I guess as long as we can go back to the old one.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.280
Yes.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.600
Wait. Oh, that wasn't the full thing. Hold on. Look at that. Oh man.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.400
The Commodore 64 version of this is so good. Why is the light flickering?

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.240
Is that concerning?

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:45.760
This is the version I play. It's like nonstop. I love this game.

01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:55.880
Okay. Sorry. Play the remix. Remember that showed up in, um,

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:59.080
beat mania. I can do that. I was going to do that during the break. Okay.

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.760
We'll just do it in break. That means everyone's still listening to the break.

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:03.640
Okay. Um,

01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:07.440
there wasn't a support version that was basically a very faithful arcade

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.480
reproduction. Um, it actually has some changes,

01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:15.160
but the really faithful version came up with the economy arcade classics for

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:19.320
PlayStation and the economy collector series at arcade advance for Game Boy

01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:23.400
advance. There are different bootleg versions. There's one called Venus.

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:29.400
Um, there is a one called Enu that was done by Italian hackers,

01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:33.360
which I guess it had more scooters, more Vespas,

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.560
and people going chow.

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:44.280
They are working on trying to, uh, restore versions on main.

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.360
So, um, there's actually,

01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:52.400
and this is what pisses me off about how awesome everything came out on the

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.880
Famicom desk system. Uh,

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:59.960
Jairus was one of the games that was a Famicom desk and it had a neat looking

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:05.640
logo, had the Konami logo over the top and it had spaceship and earth and

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:06.480
everything.

02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:11.280
And then ultra games brought out a version that was kind of, but,

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.400
um,

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:17.520
I think it was, but I thought it was pretty good for an NPS.

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:19.680
I'm talking about logo Rob. Oh,

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:24.440
but what happened though with it is it updated the graphics. Um,

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:29.280
the music in the arcade version was from the arcade version was slightly

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:31.880
remixed. There were additional tracks. Um,

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:34.320
you start off with three warp synapse instead of two warps.

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:37.440
You get a super phaser attack instead of with the normal gun. Sorry.

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:40.840
You have extra enemies, boss fights, bonus stages,

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.600
an ending to the game and in the nest version it says something about the

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:48.960
universe being at peace. Um, in the Famicom desk system,

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:52.560
you get a full ending sequence. How's that? Um,

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:57.400
you've got 39 looping stages instead of the 24 and um,

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:00.560
on the nest version you actually play through the entire solar system,

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:05.000
including the sun and Pluto. The Konami code will work for extra lives.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.200
However you have to enter it in reverse. So a, b, a, b, right, left, right, left,

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.240
down, down, up, up instead of the, you know what happens? A bit of trivia.

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:17.560
If you do the regular Konami code in Proteus, it kills you. Yeah,

02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:20.680
I think it does. If you do it in reverse, then you do it gyro style.

02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.240
I think it does that in, um, um, Gradius four, I think.

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:27.400
Yeah. Um,

02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:32.120
that version of the game is also included in the Majesco, um, TV game, Konami,

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.520
uh, collector series, not the, um, Game Boy advanced ones.

02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:41.080
So as far as other modern versions come out, like I said, there were, um,

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.920
the Game Boy advanced version, the PlayStation one. Um,

02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:46.320
you can get it on, um, Xbox live arcade.

02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:49.520
It's a tiger, tiger con chat. It says they should remake gyrus,

02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.120
like same gameplay style, but HD graphics. I'm like, it's on Xbox.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:55.840
You might've missed it.

02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:59.480
So is for anyone who's interested in other games that I've covered,

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:04.840
our type is available that way. And it's really fun. Um, also,

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:06.120
um,

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:11.120
there's a clone of the game that exists as a mini game in Grand Theft Auto,

02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:15.480
San Andreas. And like we've mentioned earlier, dance dance revolution,

02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:18.320
ultra mix two, there is a gyrus, a remix,

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.480
and it's also available on in,

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.680
in game room for Xbox 360 and windows based PCs. So there you go.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:32.640
Gyrus, there it is folks by the person who gave us street fighter.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.080
I do have a, like a sort Konami side story based on that.

02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.440
Oh, it was just, um, we,

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.000
we have our little weekly meetings and they talk about upcoming games that we're

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.320
going to come into the test and one of them was time pirate and we're like time

02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:52.520
pirate. What's that? We never heard of that game before. And, uh,

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:56.280
so then the next week the correction came in like, Oh, it was time pilot.

02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:58.160
But of course we get these notes from Japan.

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:03.040
The moment you said that I was like, time pilot guy,

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:06.280
you had a room full of gamers. All of us were like, time pirate. Oh,

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.880
that sounds cool. Yeah. But it's the same. Yeah. It's the same guy.

02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:12.480
That's why as soon as you mentioned that I was like, Oh,

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:15.920
that totally reminds me of that story where we all were stupid for,

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
I always keep forgetting that it's the same,

02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:22.200
the same person did the 1942 and Street Fighter. So, I mean,

02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:26.280
that's sort of the big tie in, you know, as a whole series of, you know,

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.480
classic games right there.

02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:32.600
I like finding the awesome people that installed so much of my childhood. Yeah.

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:33.440
That is pretty cool.

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:39.320
I spent a lot of time on a gyrus when I was much younger and not paying for

02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:44.040
school. Paid with my sanity maybe.

02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:49.840
All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Gyrus, uh,

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.640
don't go anywhere guys. We've got more of orange launch radio to come. Uh,

02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:55.200
part B is going to be a little different this week.

02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.400
We're going to do rapid fire news and then we're going to, uh,

02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.680
not do any more news after that. We're going to do some discussions.

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:02.560
We're going to do top game of the week, disappointing game. I'm sorry.

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.040
Top game of the week. Top game of 2012, disappointing game of 2012.

02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:11.040
Fugu question of the week, mailbag, lots of stuff coming up after the break and,

02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:14.280
and no 3d cock. Well,

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:17.040
we don't want to traumatize any of the younger listeners even though this is not

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:20.160
a show for kids. Turn off the radio. If you're a five year old, you're listening.

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:22.400
Um, also tonight,

02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:27.520
listless last listless of the year with our 2013 predictions in gaming.

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.000
Oh boy.

02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.720
We'll be right back after this with more of orange lounge radio.

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.560
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live with our last show of the

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:50.560
year, episode 487 for this December the 30th of 2012 and we're going to get into

02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:56.800
some of our favorite games of the year and things we weren't so thrilled with

02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:59.880
this year as is customary to do on a year end special.

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:04.160
It's our totally cliche year end special coming up a little later,

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:06.800
but first we're going to travel around and get some rapid fire news.

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.840
The last news of the year that we're going to talk about. Loki.

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.080
All right,

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.840
so let's talk a little bit about tomb Raider and like any other game that's

02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:18.960
coming out, they have to shoehorn multiplayer in there.

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:20.400
So that's what they did.

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:24.920
They confirm that it will have multiplayer and cool.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:27.560
I'm trying to remain optimistic about it.

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:29.760
Multiplayer worked out very well for mass effect three.

02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:34.520
I saw assassin creed threes multiplayer, uh, over the Christmas holiday. Um,

02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:37.520
when we were watching somebody else play it, it looked interesting. I was like,

02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:41.800
oh, that looks kind of fun to play. So multiplayer is not all bad. Yeah.

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:47.000
Um, of course there is the humble indie bundle seven that was out.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.640
Now of course, like they do with most of the humble indie bundles,

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:53.000
they add stuff to it. So now if you pay over the average,

02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:57.200
you get dungeon defenders, um, plus the DLC legends of grim rock,

02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:02.080
the basement collection, offspring fling and cave story plus,

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:06.560
which is not bad. And yeah, I had to pick it up. Cave story is awesome. Yeah.

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:09.280
So yeah, but it was also in a prior humble bundle, but that's all right.

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:12.840
That's all right. It's this is a case. Oh yeah. I don't know.

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:16.920
Keeps her plus it was it. Yeah. Yes it was. Which one was it then?

02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:20.840
They had that two years ago I think. Yes it was. It wasn't six.

02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:23.800
It was four or five had it. Really? Yep. Really?

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:26.280
Cause I've bought all of them since like,

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:29.760
probably you better check your steam library again.

02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:32.000
You probably have cave story you just forgot.

02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:37.560
Problem of steam sales is I forgot I own this seriously.

02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:41.800
I just bought another copy. No, I don't have it. So

02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:45.840
I know that mine also gives me like a little indicator to say if I've already

02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:49.040
bought a game. If I can get like a separate code, I'll just give you mine. Oh no.

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.520
You bought the humble bundle, right? Yeah.

02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.760
Thankfully they're all separate so I can get rid of this.

02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:56.640
Like there was one I bought. Oh I got yet another copy.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:59.320
I swear to God I'm like handling the bundle for,

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:03.840
I'm swimming in copies of Metro 2033. It's like I have like four of them.

02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:07.920
It's ridiculous. Um, but anyways, uh, so yeah,

02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:11.640
humble bundle. It's awesome. She definitely pick it up and you know,

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.440
they've got the indie game, the movie in there,

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.960
shank and all that fun stuff and case or plus if you haven't played it,

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.200
like I haven't played it yet. Um,

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:23.320
there's going to be a lot of indie game playing in 2013.

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.320
That one also came with super me, boy, shank and bitcher runner.

02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:32.840
Quiet, be quiet. Really? Cause I swear I got that one. Maybe I did.

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:37.360
Oh, I'll look it up while I'm doing so. Anyways, um, and the last but not least,

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.720
the first piece of DLC is going to be coming out to call of duty.

02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:44.360
Black ops is came from a leaked sign from, I'm,

02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:47.160
what can I assume probably like a game stop or something like that.

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.760
It's called call of duty black ops two revolution.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:54.600
It's gonna include five maps, one of which is a zombie maps. They have hydro.

02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:59.280
Um, looks like a dam downhill, which is a ski resort.

02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:04.760
Uh, grind, which I can't really see in this picture at all.

02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:08.080
They had a better, better picture when those on here. Um,

02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:13.400
let's see. Oh, here we go. Okay. So, um,

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:18.040
grind, which appears to be like a, um,

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:22.400
a skate park or something, which is kind of cool. A mirage,

02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:25.280
which looks like a maybe like an Asian environment.

02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:28.640
They got a lot of pagodas in the background and die rise,

02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:30.640
which is a zombie map on a high rise.

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:34.200
Plus they also give you this bonus peacekeeper, a sub machine gun,

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.800
apparently coming out on the 29th of January.

02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:42.400
And it's supposed to be exclusive, I think for the Xbox three 60 for awhile,

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:46.000
which makes sense. They've been doing that in the last few call of duty games.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.240
Um, I'm kind of excited about it.

02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:50.280
I'm looking forward to some new maps cause we're kinda,

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.800
we played out the ones on a black ops.

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.120
Although I'm also looking forward to the rest of my coworkers fucking getting

02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:59.400
that game so I can play with more than just one other person cause it's kind of

02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.760
annoying. We're all in modern warfare three and yeah,

02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:08.000
I had to kick their ass on Friday and so I won the year. Um,

02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:08.920
so yeah, that's it.

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.520
All right, well I have a few news stories for you too.

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:17.040
And uh, one of them is another retro collection coming to iOS and uh, you know,

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:20.480
iPads and iPhones and all that good stuff. And uh, very interesting.

02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:24.400
It's an info com collection. Uh, you may not remember that name,

02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:27.960
but they did all the classic text adventure games back in the day.

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:31.240
Like Zork, Zork two, Zork three. Uh,

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.320
I believe hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy was one of their games too.

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.720
It's not in this, it's not in this bundle though. I thought it was on there.

02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:41.000
Yeah. And Chanter's in there. Infidel. I remember that one. Uh,

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:43.320
planet fall witness. Yep. Wish bringer.

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:48.320
So anyhow we're spouting off all these names of games that are in the info com

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:52.640
bundle, uh, 27 classic adventure games, but it is $10.

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:56.200
Like a lot of these collections, you can get the core app for free.

02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:59.440
The free one will come with Zork one. So you get that for free.

02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:02.840
You can be eaten by a grew to your heart's content. Uh,

02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:06.800
after that you can get five packs of games for three bucks a piece or you just

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:09.840
get everything for 10 bucks. You can also,

02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:12.840
for I think a dollar by these things called Invisi clues.

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:14.720
They're the hint booklets for the games.

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.920
I have not checked out this collection myself,

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:20.120
but I'm told that they have like compasses and some additional features that you

02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:25.120
didn't have back when it was just text on a Apple two E or a Commodore system,

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.400
you know, when they didn't have anything besides that. But you know,

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.600
it's fun for like five minutes and then you realize, boy, games got a lot,

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:34.480
you know, better. All right. Uh,

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.080
Nintendo powers.

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:41.080
Last issue ranked the top 285 Nintendo games of all time.

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:44.880
285 and you might ask why such a weird number? Well,

02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:48.240
that's because there were 285 issues made of Nintendo power.

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:53.560
So that goes all the way from 285 superstar Wars on the super Nintendo.

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.760
Not a bad choice, although maybe should be a little higher all the way to number

02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:58.880
one. What is,

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.600
what does Nintendo power believe was the best Nintendo game ever made?

02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:06.840
Thoughts don't look regular Nintendo or super Nintendo, any Nintendo platform,

02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:08.320
but it had to be on a Nintendo platform.

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:12.480
Best game ever made on a Nintendo platform. Super Mario Brothers. Uh,

02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:16.480
that was number, the original Mario brothers was number 16.

02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.640
Linked to the past. Linked to the past was number two. Super Mario world.

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:24.800
If that was number two, then I'm going to say Ocarina was number one.

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:27.960
Oh, Ocarina time was number one. The number one ever rated game.

02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:34.040
Uh, the, if it's so funny, if you look at the top 10, okay.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:37.200
Top 10, 10 resident evil four on the game cube,

02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:41.600
nine Zelda Wind Waker, eight super Metroid.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.480
It should have been one, seven Mario, three, six mega man,

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:50.520
two, five Mario world, four final fantasy,

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:54.240
three or six, three super Mario galaxy,

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:58.680
two Zelda linked to the past, one Zelda Ocarina of time,

02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.120
Zelda Rina of time, Zelda Rina, where's Mario? Her name is Zelda Rina.

02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.200
Eleven is skyward sword. 12 is the original legend of Zelda.

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.000
If you look at the top 16,

02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:14.920
they are all Mario and Zelda games with the exception of eight super

02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:17.960
Metroid, six mega man, two, four, five, Nancy three.

02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:22.240
And get this at number 13, this surprised me. Elite beat agents.

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:26.360
Where's secret of mana? Secret of mana. Good question.

02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:32.120
Secret of 88. Fuck them.

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:35.800
Yeah. I was going to say, what about earth? All right.

02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:38.840
This is the last one I'm looking at. Oh, I didn't really V, V, V, V, V, V.

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.280
Was on the list at number 99. That's pretty good. Uh, all right.

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.600
I'm looking up earthbound. Uh, let's see.

02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:50.120
Oh, earth, earthworm Jim at number 200.

02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:54.080
Let's see earthbound one 56. Secret of mana. Beat it out.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:57.160
Between maniac mansion and final fantasy five advance.

02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:59.760
This I'll just games released in the U S right. Well, look,

02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:03.160
let's just say there's a reason that they pulled the plug on that magazine and

02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.960
that list will demonstrate it. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Kidding. God,

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.280
stop getting angry. All right. Cut a bitch. All right. Uh,

02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.040
one other thing for you guys, did you know that not only is the Wii U region

02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:18.760
locked, but the game pads are region locked as well.

02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:24.120
Here's the thing. If you actually try to bring like a, uh,

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:27.880
another regions, we, you, uh, pad and hook it up or whatever,

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:30.600
when it tries to do the console updates,

02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:34.880
it'll actually tell you the update cannot be completed with an overseas Wii U

02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:38.280
game pad. I don't know why the fuck anyone would ever need this.

02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:41.720
Like why would you be using some other regions game pad for when they

02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:44.080
inevitably do fun colors in Japan that we don't have?

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:48.040
But then you'll have your own when you buy the unit, you'll have your own.

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:52.560
How many spice colored game cube pads do I have?

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:54.520
I think this is a little ridiculous to get angry over.

02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:57.600
Let's get angry over the fact that the Wii U itself is not region locked.

02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.000
That's where we should be focused on. It is region locked. I know. Right.

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:04.440
That's what we should be focused on. It is not. Huh? You said it's not bad.

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:07.960
It is regional. Well, let's be mad. Let's just be mad. Let's just be mad at Rob.

02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:13.880
Anyhow. Uh, yeah. I mean, if, if whatever, okay.

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:16.480
And then the people are saying, well,

02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.720
what if someday the games do support two game pads and you have a friend from

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:21.520
Europe over

02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:28.200
fucking get over it. God, then you just fucking get over it. That's what you do.

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:29.800
You suck it up and you get over it.

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:35.360
Then you don't play that game. Yeah, exactly. You write an angry, you,

02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.000
you know what? You write another angry article on the internet.

02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:41.680
That's what you do. You go and post it to your three ones.

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:49.120
Dark Sakura. What do you have for us? Last stories of the year. Okay. Well,

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:54.160
Super Mario brothers three is going to be on the 3DS virtual console in Japan.

02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:58.800
It's coming out in the new year and uh,

02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:01.640
we don't really know when it's going to come out over here, but it's 500 yen.

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:03.960
Yay. What?

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:09.200
I heard an intake of breath as if you were going to add something to my comment

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.120
before I move on to the story about dirt bikes.

02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.320
I just wanted to mention something to Rob and the reason why that, you know,

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:17.840
we should probably discount this list. The guardian legend is not on it.

02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:22.280
What? This is why your magazine went bankrupt. I'm sorry.

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:25.800
Burn the infidels. Hashtag, hashtag. Sorry. Not sorry.

02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:28.800
The guardian legends not on it. Neither is excite trucks. So you know what?

02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:31.560
Fuck that. The best racing game and I think launch.

02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:36.640
Two 86, two 87. Go, go figure. We sports resort.

02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:38.160
Sharp stick eyeball.

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.520
So guess what's coming to battlefield three since I just mentioned a second ago,

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.880
dirt bikes, but no Camaro's. They are going to be adding offered dirt, uh,

02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:55.320
dirt bikes, mechanized and mechanized horses to battlefield three for the fifth

02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:00.920
mini expansion and game and new maps and capture the flag will be out.

02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:06.520
Then there will be lightweight double a vehicles and new trooper drops that will

02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:10.600
poop troops all over. And last but not least,

02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:16.440
there's a trailer for a game that people are losing their shit about lightning

02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:17.280
returns.

02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:22.160
That's what Rob sounds like on the toilet when he loses his shit.

02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.360
You're disgusting. You were the one who lost your shit.

02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:33.040
So final fantasy 13, lightning returns. Um,

02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:37.760
basically it looks kind of like assassin's creed kind of a style play with, um,

02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:41.600
final fantasy people in it. Okay, I'm done.

02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:47.480
All right. And that's what I said when I saw, you know, lightning returns.

02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:50.680
I'm like, I don't even care. I'll buy it. I'm not even gonna try and lie.

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:54.880
Of course. Rob's our consumer horn. I have the other two. All right.

02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:57.600
Uh, that's it for news. Uh,

02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:00.240
but we do have some other things we want to talk about, uh,

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.960
before the show is over,

02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:06.920
we want to get to 2012 in review and this is where I would use your usually play

02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.440
like a bumper or something. I don't really have any bumper or music.

02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:12.400
So actually when in doubt, just play dancer.

02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.320
For some reason, you know, it was probably in my head. It would have been fun.

02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:21.600
The level music from super Mario 64.

02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:26.200
All right, whatever. Top game of 2012.

02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:29.040
It's time to figure out what our top games of the year are. Now.

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:29.880
Here's the thing.

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:35.000
The question that we are really asking is what is your

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.760
top game of 2012? Because we don't want to get into that hole. You're wrong.

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.440
You pick the wrong game in it. Nope.

02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:45.360
There's no right or wrong answer to what your or my top game of 2012

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:50.080
is. Can't be wrong. They're just stupid. Exactly. Exactly. Uh, so we'll, um,

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.320
uh, get to this in the frugal question of the week in a minute as well,

02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:57.880
but we want to talk about what was your top game of 2012 and why

02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.760
we're going to start with the person who, uh,

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:02.720
is going to be the most completely obvious with this.

02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:06.360
Let's start with dark Sakura Mass Effect three. Duh. And why?

02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:08.120
Garris.

02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:12.280
Of course. And is there anything else you really, I mean,

02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:15.920
you just started getting this year apart from that. Well,

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:19.120
I started playing Mass Effect three, what two months after it came out,

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:22.080
after I'd beaten the other two. Um, the,

02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:25.360
there's a lot going on it that I like apart from just the stories and the

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:29.000
character development and the fact that you basically are building your head

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.480
cannon can be real in the game.

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:35.160
But the other thing that I like is modding the hell out of my shepherd and

02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:38.440
tweaking the game and figuring out how I can push boundaries in it.

02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:42.560
And I think I finally figured out how to get all the high res, um,

02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:44.080
textures to work in Mass Effect three.

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:48.960
So that's going to be for my seventh playthrough. And it's, it's really like,

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:51.080
I made an albino shepherd. I made a blue shepherd.

02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:53.760
It's the modding is so much fun for me.

02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:57.920
I will spend three hours working on getting my character to look right before I

02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:02.840
even do a mission. So it's, it's like having a girl,

02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.800
shut up. It's like having the Sims and then actually having a good game.

02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:11.920
So fair enough. And, and Garris,

02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:15.080
Shakerion, Shakerion. It's Shakerion Sunday.

02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:20.520
I posted a picture on mass effecting.tumblr.com.

02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.680
When's, when's, when's, is Shenko Saturday or what's, I guess so.

02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.600
Shenko's every other day. No. Um, but, but, but it said Shakerion,

02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:32.240
deal with it. All right. Uh, let's,

02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:35.600
let's do some of the ones that are going to be a little less obvious. Um,

02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:38.480
let's go to our guest Flaco Jones and then we're going to do Alan as well.

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:42.720
Flaco Jones. Uh, for best game. Yeah. Your favorite. What's your,

02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:46.520
your personal top game of 2012? I kinda, you know,

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:49.200
I had to make a decision cause I played two really great games this week,

02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:53.280
but I'm going to stick with the walking dead just because I just love the story

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:57.960
and I love how everything you do in the game comes back and, and it made,

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:01.720
it all mattered. So it was a great game and it, you know,

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:03.480
not terribly long and a pretty good deal.

02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:05.180
Like I know you guys are saying you got for 10 bucks.

02:20:05.180 --> 02:20:09.280
I got it for 20 and I still feel like that was a great deal because it's about

02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:14.160
two to three hours a chapter and you got five chapters. So that can 10,

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:17.960
15 hours for 20 bucks. I think it's pretty good. 10 bucks. Even better.

02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:23.640
Fair enough. Uh, Alan is back with us in studio.

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:28.360
How are you doing? Good. So what would be your pick for game of the year? Well,

02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:32.240
I almost had to recuse myself from this entire segment because I went through

02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:36.480
the Wikipedia list of all the games that came out in 20. It came out in 2012.

02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:38.880
I've played three of them all year.

02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:42.820
So doesn't mean that Mass Effect was the only thing I played,

02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:47.360
but all the games that I put hours on this year were from last year, 2010, 2009.

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:51.720
So I had three things to choose from. Black Mesa source.

02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:56.400
It's my best because it came out finally after eight years.

02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.880
So it proved all the haters wrong.

02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.560
Half Life got some love and it's just a huge testament of what a fan communities

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:07.520
are capable of. It was flawlessly professionally done.

02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:11.600
And when I say the mod community, I mean Skyrim, uh,

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:14.320
any community that has, uh,

02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:18.000
or any game that has a community that people that will put out content like

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.080
this. Black Mesa is one of the pinnacle achievements of everything.

02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:26.080
Minecraft, any game with a big enough fandom that lets you add stuff to it.

02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:28.400
So, um, yeah, it plays awesome. Um,

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:32.920
Half Life hasn't had a game come out for it since oh,

02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:37.920
seven with Half Life two episode two more time has passed between Half Life

02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:42.280
two and now than the original Half Life one got at SQL Half Life two. So yeah,

02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:45.240
it's my favorite franchise and they got some love. So that's my pick.

02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:49.680
Good answer. That's um, not what I was expecting you to pick,

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:51.800
but now that you kind of said it, I'm like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:52.840
There's a lot of sense.

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:55.640
Three games to pick from and I had to do,

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.520
I have to do the worst of 2012 from that too.

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:00.840
All right, we can, we'll, we'll manage somehow. We'll manage. All right. Uh,

02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:03.240
remember there's no right or wrong answer. All right. Um,

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:07.160
you've watched me play a ton of games and surely you can form an opinion out of

02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:08.000
that.

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:10.200
Eh, it doesn't count if I don't play it.

02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:15.560
Use your own criteria. The rest of the internet does. All right. Uh, Loki,

02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:18.720
what is your top game of 2012?

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:23.000
Uh, cause also I didn't play that many games. Um,

02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:28.640
during 2012 that came out in 2012, you know, it was like a handful of games.

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:33.160
I'd have to say probably Borderlands two and then just because it's, you know,

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:37.360
it's everything you liked from Borderlands one plus better writing, more guns.

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:41.200
And it's just, it's fun. It's like everything you loved before,

02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:46.000
amped up to 11. It's, it's great. It was a great game. Great, you know,

02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:49.680
shooting lots of, I love the writing in it. It's, I don't know,

02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:52.720
I'm really enjoying him and enjoying the fact that I'm going back and playing it

02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:56.520
some more because I kind of stopped playing it for a while. One, you know,

02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:58.280
I got busy with Minecraft and everything.

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:04.160
Um, that leaves me, huh? Um,

02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:07.280
I didn't really want to be predictable this year. Um,

02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:12.320
but I reserved the right to change this because I still have a one or two games

02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:13.680
I need to finish playing.

02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:16.200
So I reserved the right to come back on a future episode and say,

02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:17.200
I changed my mind,

02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:20.480
but I think it's going to take a lot to sway me from choosing mass effect three

02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:21.360
as my game of the year.

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.640
And a lot of that has to do with the fact that I got into the series this year.

02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:28.760
So I kind of feel like I explored the whole trilogy this year.

02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:32.760
So admittedly a little bit of that spilling over into mass effect three. Um,

02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:35.600
but it's not really just what Jamie mentioned because what's funny about what

02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:40.160
she's talking about is that's not what interests me at all in the game. Uh,

02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:42.880
and I think that's a testament to the game itself.

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:47.080
I think the staying power of mass effect three is the multiplayer.

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:50.720
And I'm going to admit when I first reviewed the game here on OLR, I said,

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:53.600
I won't give it my game of the year because some of the things in multiplayer

02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:55.000
tick me off. However,

02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:59.080
I think they've come a long way in correcting some of that,

02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:03.640
meaning that they have supported the multiplayer very well

02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:08.400
since the day it came out and with many free maps and free

02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:10.600
expansions and so forth, uh,

02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:14.640
the expansions to the multiplayer have done a phenomenal job at keeping it

02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:15.480
interesting.

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:19.920
And it's one of the few online communities where I actually really enjoy playing

02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:24.320
the game online. It's an Xbox experience I've really enjoyed. Uh,

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.840
and you know, uh, had some great time playing with friends, the game as well.

02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:31.240
There really isn't a game I've had a better value on this year with the

02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:33.640
exception of maybe World of Warcraft,

02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:37.840
Mr. Pandaria for the record. I really like multiplayer as well. And you know,

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:41.120
I thought I would hate it and I ended up really liking it.

02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:46.200
I also like finding regular maps in the game that are actually the multiplayer

02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:50.520
maps later on. So all that ending bullshit aside, it's,

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:55.480
it's not enough to really tarnish what I still feel was an amazing video game.

02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.280
However, uh, there was a lot of great shit this year and you know,

02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:02.040
journey really,

02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:05.160
I was really almost wanting to name that just so that we could all have a

02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:08.120
different one. But then I go back and I go, but I,

02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.520
all the time I spent on Mass Effect three, I can't, I can't. Walking Dead,

02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.120
however, I might take the crown.

02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.680
If anything's going to snatch the crown,

02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:19.400
wait till I finish Walking Dead episode five. Cause that might snatch it.

02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.080
So we'll see. Cause you know, when, when the writing is good,

02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:25.080
it's like really, really good.

02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:28.320
And like Walking Dead has a lot of what I love about Mass Effect just in a

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:29.840
totally different type of universe.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.840
But the whole like decision making that kind of comes back later on, it's just,

02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.680
yeah, there's a lot of that there too. So I reserve the right to change my answer.

02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:41.640
It's just the internet. It's not that serious.

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:45.240
Speaking of not that serious, let's go to the flip side.

02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:49.200
What was your most disappointing game of 2012?

02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.920
Maybe you could say the worst game, but I would say more like,

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.360
what was just such a huge disappointment that you're just really sad.

02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.080
What was your most disappointing game of 2012? Um,

02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:02.360
I guess we'll go in the same order. So Dark Soccer, I'll start with you again.

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:05.640
Um, Street Fighter X Tekken. Ooh.

02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:08.280
It was piss in a bucket.

02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:14.120
What about it? Just was it, it didn't play well, the whole Mega Man thing.

02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:18.120
It just felt like a giant insult to the people who were fans of the series.

02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:20.800
I can't help but think of the DLC being on disc.

02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:21.960
That's what I'm always going to think of.

02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:27.240
It's just a combination of a less than stellar

02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:30.680
game combined with really poor business decision.

02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:35.400
My, the fiscally responsible part of my brain just goes, no, can't do it.

02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:39.960
And keep in mind, I didn't buy it. I borrowed it and I gave it back.

02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:45.600
So it was pretty bad. Uh, who went next? I think Flaco.

02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:49.280
What would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012? Well,

02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:52.120
I didn't play it, so I guess that's why you can say it's not the worst game.

02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:55.880
But I was very disappointed that I heard so many bad things about the Silent

02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:59.920
Hill HD remake. That was pretty bad. Yeah. See,

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:03.720
I've never heard anything good about it. And it's just,

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:06.600
I was very disappointed cause I was very, I was very much looking forward to it.

02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:09.240
I was going to buy it right away. But you know,

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:11.760
I guess luckily target didn't have it when it came out.

02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:13.960
And then I heard more and more about it and I was like, you know what,

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.480
I'm not going to buy it. It sounds like it's a waste of money.

02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:20.840
There's also that crap with them not doing the upgrade. The, yeah,

02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:24.800
for the, that was for two right in the two and three collection. They didn't,

02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:27.160
yeah, they didn't upgrade the graphics like we have,

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:30.680
or they didn't do the fog or something and wires are going off into the distance

02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:34.280
and you can tell them having done a patch for other versions,

02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:37.800
but not the Xbox one I think. Oh, I don't know about that. I just know,

02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:38.640
see that's this thing.

02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:43.080
There's so many bad so much bad news about that game and so many bugs and to

02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:47.080
release a game with that many bugs, it's just like, it's just too much.

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.160
They needed their best tester back. That's the problem.

02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:54.080
You laughed and everything went to hell. How did this get through?

02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:57.720
I just feel like this guy back, I almost wonder if they took the viewpoint of,

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.800
you know, we already tested this game. It's fine.

02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:03.720
We're just going to up residence to get out. It was a total disaster.

02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:08.200
It sounded like, I don't know anybody who bought it and liked it. Um,

02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:10.040
who'd be next? Oh, Alan. Alan's next. Alan,

02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:13.000
what would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012?

02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:18.160
Mass Effect Infiltrator for iOS and Android.

02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:19.880
Yeah, that was kind of.

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.120
Cause I got my first smartphone ever finally in September and then I figured

02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:26.160
out that the data pad,

02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:30.240
which is like the sort of your characters in your party email you and it's

02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:33.200
really neat. You can, um, you know, update your galactic readiness,

02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.640
which is a mechanic and Mass Effect three through this app.

02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:36.880
It's not available for the Android.

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:42.200
So only iPhone users get to do the little cute email character mini game.

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.440
So I was like, all right, I'll get the other Mass Effect, um, mobile game.

02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:51.680
Infiltrator and you play a Cerberus dude and there's also ways that it ties into

02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:55.560
the, your three main campaign. It's awful.

02:28:55.960 --> 02:29:00.960
It's an amazing testament to how good graphics can be on smartphones nowadays,

02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.200
but you play with your thumbs and it's really awful and it's not fun at all.

02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:10.560
And it was like eight bucks that I wish I had back because I could buy lunch

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.400
with that.

02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:15.840
It's not that good on iOS either.

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:20.760
Was it really eight bucks on, on sale for eight bucks?

02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:24.600
I want to say it was 12 originally and I've heard it's no better on the iPad.

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:26.480
And I think, didn't you want to install it off your iPad?

02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:30.720
Yeah, I did. It takes up a gig and it was just a wasted gig. No tan,

02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:33.240
no tactile control or tangible controls makes it a bitch.

02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:37.200
What's the IK though? I don't know. Cause I don't have one.

02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:40.440
I thought that it worked with the IK, but I could be right. It might,

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:43.880
I don't know. Yeah, but that's all. Um,

02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:46.840
I'm trying to remember what the other game was that came out this year that I

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:51.080
played Mass Effect Mass Effect three. Yeah. All right. Fair enough.

02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:53.360
Uh, Loki, then I guess we go to you.

02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:56.080
What was your most disappointing game that came out this year?

02:29:56.200 --> 02:30:01.040
Lollipop chainsaw. Oh, it was terrible. Uh huh. It just,

02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:05.720
it wasn't a fun game to play and it wasn't,

02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:08.200
I mean it's just kind of like, Oh, it's Suda 51.

02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:10.920
It's going to be so really crazy and edgy and stuff.

02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:14.120
And they tried that with Shadows of the Damned and it was just not very good game.

02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:18.360
Really? I liked Shadows of the Damned. Eh, it was all right,

02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:21.320
but I liked what I saw of it. It's just, it wasn't,

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:25.560
it wasn't to the level of what I wanted. So I don't know.

02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:30.320
Uh, I'll drop a whopper on this segment.

02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:33.240
I'm going to say the most disappointing game of the year was Diablo three.

02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:35.640
You know what? Yeah.

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:39.920
And I don't really know how to put it into words.

02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:43.800
It's not that I necessarily like hate, I mean, here's the thing. It's,

02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:48.080
this is very much not Diablo three was not the worst game of the year.

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:50.280
I would say the worst game of the year would be something like,

02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:52.120
I was going to say Sonic four episode one,

02:30:52.120 --> 02:30:54.360
but it only came out on the windows platform this year.

02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:56.800
But that would still probably be the worst game of the year.

02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:59.920
I would probably go with HD collection just based on what I've seen and so

02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:01.600
forth. But I would say honestly,

02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:04.160
Diablo three was the most disappointing game of the year.

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:08.360
Just some of the craptacular decisions Blizzard made towards with the whole

02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:10.280
real money auction house was,

02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:15.280
was just such a bad grab and the PVP getting removed out of it at the end.

02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:17.600
It just, it just wasn't a lot of fun to play.

02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:22.400
Like somehow the fun got sucked out over the 10 years between Diablo two and

02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:23.080
Diablo three.

02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:26.320
And I think a lot of that was Blizzard really not listening to their fan

02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:26.800
community.

02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:29.600
So I think they're really going to have to go back and answer to that a bit.

02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:32.680
So when you got torchlight two,

02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:35.880
didn't you think that the pickup and go within the first 20 minutes of torchlight

02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:37.480
two was way more fun than Diablo three,

02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:39.240
but Diablo three was how many years in the making?

02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:44.520
I enjoyed torchlight two in the one hour I played it more than I did Diablo

02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:48.160
three. And that says enough right there. I think you're absolutely right.

02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:51.360
Torchlight two is a better game than Diablo three in my opinion.

02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:55.400
So that's that. Uh,

02:31:55.480 --> 02:32:00.200
looking at some of the comments in chat room at, uh, live.vognetwork.com.

02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:03.760
Fantas says, no way. Diablo three should win game of the year. Sorry.

02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:04.920
That's my personal answer.

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:08.360
I think it went poop of the year act. Acidic vampire says,

02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:12.280
disappointing doesn't mean bad. I think that's a very important point. And yes,

02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:14.960
I agree with you on that. Uh, tiger class says, Oh yeah,

02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:19.400
Blizzard canceled the Diablo three PVP mode. Um, they, they didn't cancel.

02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:21.640
Well, fifth dream fills it in there. They didn't cancel it.

02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:23.560
They just postponed it there. They basically,

02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:26.240
they realized it was, I mean,

02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:30.480
that said to me that they weren't as far along with it as they let on.

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:32.960
And that now that they're actually building it, they're like, shit,

02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:34.360
this doesn't really work out very well.

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:37.560
Or it's like it's throwing everything off balance. Like I, I,

02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:40.120
I think they're pulling it out of their ass as they go.

02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:43.280
And for a game that was 10 years in development, that's very alarming.

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:45.960
And at this point, is it going to come in an expansion? Probably.

02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:49.800
That sounds ridiculous. I mean, they, they can't do that though.

02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.520
They have to kind of patch it in because at this point,

02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:53.320
wasn't that promised when they sold the game?

02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:55.800
I didn't pay for it.

02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:01.640
I never got my, I never got my dance studio, but I think there's a big,

02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:06.360
there's a big difference between a Warcraft dance studio and PVP,

02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:10.440
which has its very passionate fans, you know, even in, wow,

02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:13.280
we don't talk a lot about PVP on a courthouse cause not a lot of it play it,

02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:16.280
but there is definitely like, like one thing I learned this,

02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:18.000
what we haven't talked about a lot about it during the show,

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.560
but we have been depth.

02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:23.280
We've been dipping our big toe in the water when it comes to game streaming,

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:25.200
we're finally getting up with the current times.

02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:28.680
We've kind of relaunched our Twitch TV channel and we did a couple of games

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:33.000
streams this week. We had mass effect three last week when there was no show. Uh,

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.040
we did some multiplayer to show that off and Shane and I were doing some

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:39.240
Warcraft this week while I was looking at some of the other Twitch channels and

02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:41.520
kind of what people are streaming on their world of Warcraft.

02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:46.520
Lots of PVPers lots of that is arena rated battlegrounds.

02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:49.000
I mean, if you're wondering like who's doing rated battlegrounds,

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.200
just load up Twitch.

02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:53.000
And I imagine any of the competing websites like you stream and so forth,

02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:55.480
same story. There's a lot of that scene going on there.

02:33:55.480 --> 02:34:00.080
So it definitely has their passionate fans. So, all right.

02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:04.160
Uh, there we go. So let's get to the frugal question of the week.

02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:06.360
Cause that was everybody, right? I didn't miss anybody. Just making sure.

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:12.000
We asked a very similar question in our frugal question of the week. Uh,

02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:15.720
every week we ask our Facebook and our Google plus communities smash it

02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:20.120
together. You get frugal a question and we asked them one of the same questions.

02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:24.000
We just asked you guys. Holy fucking shit.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.600
We got 25 responses on Facebook. Yep. I can't read all of these.

02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:31.000
There were about eight after the first minute you posted it.

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:34.960
Yeah, I know. And I looked before the show, there was eight and I'm like, okay,

02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.160
eight. I can manage that. Now there are 25. I,

02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:42.000
I am overwhelmed by you guys being so awesome and replying,

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.200
but there's no way I can read all those answers. Oh my God.

02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:48.280
There's five on Google plus two. There's five people on Google plus Rob.

02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:51.880
If I have to read 10 emails, you have to read 48 little short responses.

02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:56.120
All right. There's five Google employees that listen to the show. All right.

02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:59.560
I'm going to, I'm going to really run through these. I apologize in advance.

02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:02.840
I'm going to really trim your answers to get everybody's answers out there. Okay.

02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:04.360
Um,

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.960
act depth says dust and Alicia and tail is the game of the year.

02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:10.680
Dust combines RPG,

02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:14.960
Metroidvania and beat them up style game play to make a real fun game to play.

02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:18.680
And can you imagine this game was made by only one person?

02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:22.640
That's quite the feat. I didn't know. I was not as huge into,

02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:25.920
into dust and Alicia. No, nevermind.

02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:30.600
I'm getting that game confused with from dust. Very different. Sorry. Sorry.

02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:35.240
Yes. That is an awesome game that it was supposed to be an X-Box live indie.

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:36.480
I have not played that yet.

02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:39.840
And it actually was so good that it became an X-Box live arcade game.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.040
Okay. All right. So I will, I will make it a point to check that out later.

02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:45.760
I thought when I first read it, I was like, Oh,

02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:48.360
he's talking about that from dust game that I played once. And I was like, nah,

02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:50.080
I'm not, I'm not into this. You know,

02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:51.840
it's kind of trying to be populous or whatever.

02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:59.720
Uh, Rob says my 2012 pick is the iPad version of pinball arcade.

02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:02.480
It has the most tables and they're all from actual tables.

02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:06.400
The iPad is the right size for the portrait orientation. Good, good,

02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:11.320
very good pick. Uh, Nick M replied. He gave two answers,

02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:12.160
big budget,

02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:17.000
halo four citing three 43 is ability to pick up the franchise from bungee and

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.440
made the most polished halo today.

02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:22.760
I got to say halo four was pretty rock fucking solid compared to some of the

02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:26.600
previous halo efforts. I really agree with what Nick's saying there. Uh,

02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:30.920
smaller studio walking dead, citing the emotional connection, uh,

02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:34.200
red entertainment says three very good games. I've played this year,

02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:37.400
mass effect three dragon age origins, assassin's creed three.

02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:40.600
Remember it's this year. What, what you you've played. Uh,

02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:42.680
when I think of a game that I've played throughout the year,

02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:46.360
got a lot of enjoyment out of and shared with multiple people ticket to ride on

02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:50.320
the iPad. You know the old, the board game, the trains. All right.

02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:55.440
Uh, Justin M replied and said, dope upon kingdom for the wheat.

02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:56.760
It was released a while ago,

02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:00.640
but me and my partner started playing it obsessively this year. Uh, good,

02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:03.880
not so clean because we make it dirty. Monopoly esque fun.

02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:08.360
Now I'm kind of curious. What's a good, not so clean. Cause we make it dirty.

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:12.600
What's a like insensitive jokes or what's that all about there? All right.

02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:18.200
Uh, let's see, let's get to some of the answers from Facebook. You ready?

02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.440
Here we go. Degenerate Johnny. I'm positive.

02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.200
I'm not alone when I say mass effect three. Why Garris?

02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:28.680
Just that big curiosity. Are you degenerate Johnny? Like,

02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:34.920
all right. Uh, DJ Rama S said, final fantasy theater rhythm.

02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:36.720
It was a unique music rhythm game.

02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:40.560
Rob himself said assassin's creed three.

02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:43.760
They did a good job in reinventing a system that's not broken,

02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:46.680
but feels fresh and new with the reasons you liked past games.

02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:49.480
That's very interesting because a lot of people are giving assassin's creed

02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:53.440
three shit. Um, I haven't played enough of it to say, see, see it either way.

02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.120
But then again, Rob, here I am saying mass effect.

02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:00.040
Three's my game of the year and there's a lot of people to give that series some

02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:04.200
shit. So you know what? I am, I am sympathizing with you.

02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:10.240
Uh, Eric S replied Tricoro. Do you guys even know what Tricoro is?

02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:14.560
I've heard of it. Nope. I've heard of it. Do you know what it is?

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.960
No, it's 2DX BeatMania 2DX. I think number 20.

02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:23.320
I just, that's why I knew what it was. Cause I was like,

02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:24.680
it's one of the Bimani games.

02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:28.160
Eric S says Tricoro because it's beat mania. Uh,

02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:32.200
Cram said mass effect three. I think the flaws were exaggerated.

02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.720
By the way, mass effect podcast.

02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:38.920
Don't give me that look. We're working on it.

02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:45.360
Look forward to more exciting things in 2013 from OLR studios. All right. Uh,

02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:48.120
Haseo Sumuragawa says Borderlands 2.

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.120
Handsome Jack is the most lovable bad guy ever.

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.640
Can't help to giggle when his echoes pop up. That or Arkham city.

02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:55.840
Cause Catwoman is a bad-ass.

02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:58.640
Actually in the border, even though I didn't play Borderlands 2,

02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:03.040
that would be Dan's game of the year to say, I have to say Mad Moxie's awesome.

02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:08.600
Uh, Name and Lights says on console, Forza Horizon on PC,

02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:10.760
Missipandaria. Uh,

02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:15.720
Gamer Girl said a mud called Oasis taking it back to

02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:20.280
the muds. That's awesome. You know what a mud is? Flocka, you got to confuse me.

02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:22.920
It's you log into the terminal,

02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:25.440
like speaking of text adventures like Zork and all that shit.

02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:29.080
Imagine if you were playing a text adventure MMO.

02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.120
That's kind of what a mud is. You go into like a terminal.

02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:33.960
I don't think I've heard of that before. Yeah.

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:36.880
It's like they used to be much bigger like 10 years ago, but there's still,

02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:39.600
there's still a scene for it. That's the ready player one.

02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:43.720
Oh, okay. All right. Uh,

02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:46.200
Gamer Girl says I love this game because my first time playing,

02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:48.600
been playing since it came online a few days ago. Love it.

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:54.160
Dark Tetsuya says I'm going to change it up and say DDR2 for the Wii because of a

02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:58.800
great song list. Flaming Toilet. God,

02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.320
I love that username says Journey. Thanks to the communication limits,

02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:07.480
there's finally a multiplayer game that doesn't make me hate people. True story.

02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:09.600
I was talking to, um, if you listen to Horde House,

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:11.840
you've probably heard of Sunshine. He does,

02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:17.120
he does the podcast with Spike Game Boy and he was talking to me,

02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:18.680
he'll probably talk about this on his show.

02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:20.520
He was talking about his play through on Journey.

02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:23.600
He finally played it through the first time and he said he had a companion that

02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:26.000
he had through most of the game too. And at the very end,

02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:29.560
the companion drew a heart in the snow. Oh,

02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:33.880
Oh, and it's like if you have all the fields at that same moment as well,

02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:35.200
it's just like, I'm going to like,

02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:39.720
that's like Les Mis level crying right there at the end. All right. Yeah.

02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:43.480
I was always like really chatty in my thing. I would just be constantly like,

02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:45.880
I would just be mashing and like, we got to go fast here.

02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:50.280
So I'm just going to be like, follow me. I know where to go.

02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:52.000
Watch out for the big stone dragon things.

02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:57.640
Uh, dark Tetsuya in chat says, wait, OLR studios.

02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:59.800
I thought you guys were a vog now. No, we are vog.

02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:04.800
We're vog is the network that many of the OLR studios shows play on,

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:06.920
such as orange, Andreo and Horde house.

02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:09.320
But if you look at the way movies are made,

02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.240
sometimes the movie maker is not the same as the distributor.

02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:15.480
Go research it on Wikipedia. All right. Meanwhile,

02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:20.400
Veronica S replies and says Pokemon white version two because it's addictive.

02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:23.160
Another Pokemon addict. That's all right though.

02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.760
I know a lot of lot of pokey addicts. Ronnie B replied and said,

02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:31.000
far cry three. It motivated me to enjoy gaming again.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:34.000
That's a pretty big endorsement there. The environment is alive.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.320
The AI acts responsibly, engaging and overall a great game.

02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:41.160
It's on Steam sale right now. Uh,

02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.200
Ferdinand F replied and said lone survivor. I haven't heard of that one,

02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:49.600
but he says it scratched the silent Hill itch. I didn't realize I still had.

02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:54.800
I will have to kind of earmark that we like survival horror. So, uh,

02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.120
Burr replied and said, going by the number of hours poured into it.

02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:01.920
Borderlands two, same great gameplay refined into perfection.

02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:04.920
And some of the most memorable and funniest lines of the year, hands down,

02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:09.040
honorable mention to assassins, Craig, assassins, Craig, Creed, not Craig,

02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:11.800
assassins, Creed three, uh,

02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:15.480
taking one of my favorite periods in history and adding new gameplay elements to

02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:17.840
great effect. Osofer replied and said,

02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:21.640
mass effect three keeps coming back long after it's been released only to play

02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:25.840
through it again and explore new paths in the story or another ending to enjoy.

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:30.920
Uh, multiplayer endorsing that as well. Uh, more answers.

02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:35.520
Raginator says Diablo two. I know it's a 12 year old title,

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:36.880
but he just got it this year.

02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:41.680
Console wise is two way tie between magic 2013 and super stardust HD.

02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:43.400
Those are two games on PlayStation three.

02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:48.000
I love the most and put the most time into a acidic vampire said mass effect

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:48.400
three,

02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.600
a fantastic finale to a trilogy with the best characters ever written for a

02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:54.360
video game series. It's a pretty big endorsement. Uh,

02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:58.360
Luliana says mass effect three. It's just that awesome.

02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:01.480
Even if I'd played more while our hours spent, uh,

02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:04.320
I really wish we got to do more with Rex, but still Emmy three,

02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:08.400
Dave Falcon said it's Duke Nukem forever. What,

02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:10.760
what are no wrong answer.

02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:15.520
There's no wrong answer because I spent a good portion of 2012 playing it and

02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:20.480
deus X human revolution because my fiance got me hooked on it. Oh, okay.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.320
I see you played it cause the fiance, you had to for the fiance. That's all right.

02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:29.040
P S happy new year. My gaming friends. Well, happy new year to you as well.

02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:32.120
Gino L said the walking dead.

02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:36.280
It handled some pretty taboo concepts gracefully and changed the way I think

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:40.040
about games. Change the way I think about games.

02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:45.040
That's pretty heavy right there. That's now I'm like super interested.

02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:49.600
Uh, Shane, uh, from hoard house replied and said mass effect three.

02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:51.960
What a fucking shock. Hey,

02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:56.640
most personally impactful game series I've ever played runners up persona for

02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:00.760
golden and DJ max technica tune. Uh, SSJ 100. Matt said,

02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:04.600
I'm going to say NHL 13 while this is no surprise for me,

02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:08.720
given I buy NHL games every year without fail this year is special with the

02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:12.960
current labor dispute and the possibility of there not being any hockey this

02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:16.880
year. NHL hockey. I have to look elsewhere for my hockey fix. Well,

02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:19.920
I do play and pick up hockey games in real life and go to minor league and

02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:22.640
college hockey. NHL 13 is the only way,

02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:26.280
only way to pay and watch my favorite players and teams play.

02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.000
That's a depressing answer. It is sad that that's like the only way to get

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.760
hockey if you're in the NHL. Like I totally get it.

02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:35.320
And like I think that's like an awesome answer in many ways,

02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:37.000
especially if you're a hockey fan, but it's just like,

02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:40.080
it really puts it into perspective. Like they, they,

02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:41.840
they need to fucking figure it out.

02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:45.160
We have gone over the fiscal cliff and hockey is what has happened here.

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:47.920
And this just happened like six years ago. They canceled their season. Yeah.

02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:50.320
I think it was that long ago. Shame, shame baseball.

02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:53.760
Never recovered from that shit. Well, I know they have now they have now,

02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:56.960
but they took forever. But when the next bargaining agreement came by,

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.280
they signed it and they got it done right away. They didn't drag this out.

02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:03.000
And the hockey is doing this now for the second time in less than 10 years.

02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.800
Wow. A code man replied and said the walking dead.

02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:10.360
I've never felt so emotionally attached to a game in a long while.

02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.840
And this one definitely hooks you last but not least. Alpha Kananagram,

02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:21.120
Hatsune Miku project diva F even though the scratch feature is meh.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.520
Good. No wrong answers. I know, but I'm as in, I'm not surprised. Oh, okay.

02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:30.280
Good music rhythm game with neat bonuses. There you go.

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:35.120
I liked the variety of answers there. That was great. Um, it wasn't all,

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:37.920
I mean, of course there was some mass effects, walking dead journeys,

02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:39.280
the things you're going to expect to see.

02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:42.760
But I really liked hearing about some of those other ones too. Uh, really,

02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:44.520
really neat. So thank you guys for answering.

02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:47.360
And I went ahead and read just about every year,

02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:50.000
every answer that actually had a game in it. I read those answers.

02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:53.520
So there you go. Thank you, Facebook. Thank you, Google.

02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:55.720
Thank you to everybody who's participated. Uh,

02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:59.840
was that a new segment for this year or did we debut that last year this year?

02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:03.920
So thank you for, um, catching onto our new segment this year. We appreciate it.

02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:09.600
All right. Uh, that means it's time to go to the mail bag. Oh yes.

02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:13.120
Revenge will be mine. Here we go to the mail bag mail bag at orange

02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:18.480
lounge, radio.com. You guys sent a lot of fucking email this week.

02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:20.480
Yeah, but some of them aren't very big. Okay.

02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:24.080
So dark soccer is going to read your emails. Uh, but if she skipped some,

02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:25.400
don't be hurt because seriously,

02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:27.880
there were like 10 emails in there where I look, don't be butthurt.

02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:31.320
All it does is make you stink. All right. Dark soccer. Read some emails.

02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:36.160
This comes from Grimsley because it's a person I haven't seen before.

02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:39.400
I'm reading it because I'm nice. Hey guys, love the show.

02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:41.920
I was wondering what the name of the background song used in one of your

02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:45.520
segments. It starts out like Bela Lugosi's dead. If that helps.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:49.680
Hope to hear from you soon. Happy holidays. What do we have?

02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:51.160
That sounds like Bela Lugosi's dead.

02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:56.000
Honestly, cause I could only think of the chorus of

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:56.840
Bela Lugosi's dead.

02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:01.920
So I went and YouTubed it and the beginning sounds an awful lot like this.

02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.600
Oh yeah, that's true.

02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:10.240
It's the boogal song. La Bossa Nova de Fabienne from Beatmania.

02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:14.440
It was in the hip hop mix in the U S I think it's from, um,

02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:18.040
some of the Japanese mixes too. Anyway,

02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:21.760
what I did for this listener and for anybody who's asking questions like what

02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:23.920
song are you using on orange lounge radio?

02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.080
I made a post in the vog network forums at vognetwork.com.

02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:32.040
Click on forums, click on orange lounge radio and there's a topic. Yeah. Well,

02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:34.040
you know, we get more people over there. There's a topic.

02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:35.600
What music do you use on orange lounge radio?

02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:39.440
And I gave you all the songs and links to the YouTubes so you can, you know,

02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:40.000
do it.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.480
How about for our listeners who, uh,

02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:48.280
aren't as in tune with the goth music scene, play a little Bela Lugosi's dead.

02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:51.400
I was just about to do that except you were like two steps ahead of me.

02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:54.120
Was that the entire email? Yeah, pretty much.

02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:58.120
I wouldn't mind reading the rest of the emails to Bela Lugosi's dead. Hey,

02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:03.240
and if anyone ever watched, um, you know, early two thousands SNL goth talk.

02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:10.240
Hi Asriel, the prince of dark and sorrow and he works with me at the sit up.

02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:16.160
All right, here's, here's the nine minute mix of Bauhaus,

02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:20.840
Bela Lugosi's dead. See that.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.880
So I thought it has to be the fugal song.

02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:31.040
Uh, Bauhaus named after my favorite art school that got shut down by the Nazis

02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:32.880
but reopened.

02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:35.640
But then like all the way towards the end of the song is when it gets into the

02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:36.480
more familiar part.

02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:40.120
But honestly,

02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.480
we would not have certain styles of furniture today if not for the Bauhaus

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:44.320
movement. Just saying,

02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:50.560
don't ever ask an art student to go off on stuff like that. Anyway, um,

02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:53.960
this one comes from spazzinator. Hi gang.

02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:56.120
It's your raging neighborhood spazzinator.

02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:00.400
The strange thing happened that interrupted my plans to get a cat this weekend

02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:02.040
and let's take a minute. Just sit right there.

02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:06.560
I'll tell you how I became the catless raginator in Buffalo. Oh,

02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:09.040
he's doing it as a, as a

02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:13.680
fresh prince. Yeah, but I'm not going to wrap it.

02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:20.240
You're moving with your auntie and uncle Garris on the Normandy.

02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:24.760
It's a parody. I get it. Yeah. I'm not reading it. Sorry. Can I wrap it?

02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:25.880
I just closed it.

02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:32.360
All right. I rage nator, I will do your email justice.

02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:35.640
Give me a moment to set it up. Okay. I'm going to go ahead to the next one.

02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:40.240
This is from nasty canasta and I'm sorry I don't speak any Spanish other than

02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:44.120
Fuego. Um, so I'm going to try to pronounce this right.

02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:46.800
Is Ola y buenos burritos.

02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:49.920
Ola y buenos burritos.

02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:52.920
I would like to bring your attention to your attention.

02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:55.920
A game announcement that flew under the radar, the binding of Isaac remake.

02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:01.040
Only touch on major points announced so far produced and developed by Nicholas

02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:05.320
releasing at the end of 2013. Currently confirmed for PC, PS3 and Vita.

02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:09.160
Nicholas is in talks with Nintendo and Microsoft have come and to have the game

02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:10.640
on Wii U, 3DS and 360.

02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:13.120
The remake will support a new pixelated look similar to that of the GBA.

02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:17.800
All content will from the base Isaac game and the wrath of the lamb expansion

02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.400
will be included plus another batch of new content about as big as wrath of the

02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:25.760
lamb is in the remake. Local co-op confirmed no online co-op is that would

02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:26.760
extend development time.

02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:30.160
Danny Baranowski returns to compose new and remixed tracks, new player,

02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:31.840
playable character, new ending,

02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:35.680
and new final level that seems likely to appear after the game's shale level.

02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:39.280
Anyone interested in finding out more in depth remake details can go to Edward

02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:44.320
McMillan's Tumblr at EDMUNDM.com and the binding of Isaac's subreddit on Reddit.

02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:49.040
I have also attached a mock up screenshots made by Edmund himself.

02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:52.160
Happy burritos nasty canasta. And um, yeah,

02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:55.080
I can't really link these to everybody, but thank you for the reminder though.

02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:58.480
Because I remember reporting on this before cause we were kind of joking like

02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:01.960
LOL remake of a game that's not that old, but uh, yeah, I was interested in it.

02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:05.200
So by the way, uh, Ragenator's email,

02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:07.120
the problem is at the end of it,

02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:09.680
he turns it into a Rick roll thing and uh,

02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:12.160
I'm still a little upset about the time he tried to Rick roll the show.

02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:13.600
So we are sending rage.

02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:16.880
I will not be doing that email justice and we will be sending that email to the

02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:19.600
round files. So here you go, Ragenator. Here goes your email.

02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:26.720
The vog network.com.

02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:31.040
Okay. This is from raw steel UT. Hey guys,

02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:34.040
now that we're all done with Christmas and getting our new year's resolutions

02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:34.880
ready and shit,

02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:38.360
what are you guys looking forward to in the next year in gaming?

02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:42.200
Any cool games? Maybe some cool, but ultimately useless gimmick thoughts. Ahoy.

02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:44.200
Um, I'm playing more mass effect.

02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:48.840
Hold that thought because we have a list list coming up that is tackling this

02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:51.120
exact topic. You read our minds.

02:51:53.080 --> 02:51:54.880
Holy shit. Off topic.

02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:57.480
One of my friends has a copy of the live action Rurouni Kenshin movie.

02:51:57.880 --> 02:52:02.480
Gonna watch it. Okay. Next up. I told you I was reading them all.

02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:05.640
Do your orange Jones radio. First off,

02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:09.800
I would like to apologize for any grammar mistakes I may make as I have been

02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:12.960
very tired. I love the whole covering my ass in the beginning thing.

02:52:13.480 --> 02:52:16.200
If you cover your ass in the beginning, that's fine. All right.

02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:19.680
I wanted to send a personal thank you to all of you for helping me with an issue

02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:24.000
I've had problems with dealing with for a long time now. A while back I asked,

02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:27.160
what was the best way to come out to friends and family regarding sexual

02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:29.920
orientation? You all gave me great help with it.

02:52:29.960 --> 02:52:33.080
The one thing I learned from OLR is to be yourself. Tonight.

02:52:33.080 --> 02:52:36.440
I finally told my youngest sister that I have been bisexual for a good while.

02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:37.240
Now, 10 years,

02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:41.040
she asked if I had a girlfriend and I said that I had,

02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:43.280
but things didn't go well. She said, well, you know,

02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:47.280
you could have told me and I wouldn't have cared one way or another because

02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:48.800
you're my sister. I said, well,

02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:52.760
I was afraid because of our beliefs about quote that sort of thing. She's,

02:52:53.640 --> 02:52:56.640
she said, are you crazy? You're my sister and I care about you and love you.

02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:59.200
So I just wanted to let you guys know that thanks to you all,

02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:02.720
I finally got the courage to come out because of you all just to tell my sister

02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:05.040
how I felt. Thanks again. Sincerely, gamer girl.

02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:11.920
I think in many ways like, and I think we get asked this question a lot,

02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:16.400
like you've been doing this show for how long you've been doing this show for 10

02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:17.360
and a half years.

02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:21.640
What motivates you to spend every Sunday to give up your entire Sunday night and

02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:24.680
you don't go out to the clubs anymore and you go stay inside and you do this

02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:27.280
internet radio show, like what do you get from that? Why do you do that?

02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:29.560
And like in many ways,

02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:33.360
that email that she just read like just justifies everything. Yeah.

02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:35.360
So thank you.

02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:40.960
Totally. And major congrats to you too.

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:44.240
And absolutely. I'm making it about us,

02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:48.400
but congratulations to you and I know that you and I have talked about other

02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:53.000
things too, so just keep your chin up. Not you and me, Rob,

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.400
but me and her. I got it. Hey guys,

02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:57.360
Sterling here. A couple of weeks ago,

02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:01.480
you guys were talking about Konami's VRC6 sound chip for the Famicom,

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.040
but did you know there was a step above that?

02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:08.880
The VRC7 to the NES sound capability to a whole new level placing literally

02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:11.640
on par with the Genesis slash mega drive. However,

02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:16.400
only one game uses amazing chip being the Japanese exclusive RPG, uh,

02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:20.440
LaGrange point. There's okay. He linked to YouTube on it for how it sounds.

02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:23.880
Rob, if you would actually pull that up for me, I would greatly appreciate it.

02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:26.200
I will. Sorry. I was yelling at Ramen check as Ramen said,

02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:28.840
who the fuck goes clubbing on Sunday nights? We used to go,

02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:31.480
it's not around anymore, so we wouldn't, but the, the, the,

02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:35.400
and don't make fun of us, but we had the goth club, the rage, the,

02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:38.760
it was the rage and they changed their name. What was it called? Asylum. No,

02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:42.320
remember we went to the rage for my bachelorette party. Yeah, I know.

02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:45.920
But that was like, and after all the vodka shots,

02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:49.040
the jello shots and watching Barbarella. I've been asked,

02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:51.240
when was the last time you went to asylum? And I'm like, I don't know.

02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:55.640
When did I start OLR? So anyway, I'm sorry.

02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:00.000
Uh, which one am I pulling up? Oh, this one. Yeah. From, um, Sherlock. Okay.

02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:04.040
Got it. Okay. Yes. I want to do a play this. Okay.

02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:06.520
So let's listen to a little bit of it. I'm going to fast forward a little bit

02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:11.520
here. That's a Nintendo game.

02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:16.520
That sounds very unlike most Nintendo games you're used to hearing.

02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:19.920
I probably picked like a really boring part, but

02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:23.760
it looks like fantasy star. Sounds pretty.

02:55:30.240 --> 02:55:33.160
I also wanted to tell you about a mainstream game I've been playing from a

02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:36.320
series, which I never thought would be playable for blind people.

02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:38.240
That being resident evil six.

02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:41.120
This game is what I like to call accidentally accessible,

02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:44.760
meaning that some of its features tend to help blind people without meaning to

02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:47.320
chief among these is the PDA system,

02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:48.840
which points you in the right direction.

02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:52.280
You need to go as long as you have the button for it held down while you walk.

02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:57.200
I'm already most of the way through chapter two of Leon's campaign and I'm

02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:59.640
through the trickiest section as far as accessibility goes.

02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:03.000
That being the bell puzzle. Anyway, enough of my rambling.

02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:06.560
I hope you guys are having an awesome holiday season and keep up the awesome

02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:08.440
job as always. RIP Shermy,

02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:11.880
Sherlock, my baby.

02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:16.080
Yes. That has been the sad part of my year.

02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:19.000
You guys have made the holidays even more awesome.

02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:26.640
Sorry. I was thinking about my kitty. Looking forward, not back.

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:31.720
I know it's tough. Um, this comes from, um, Robert M.

02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:37.040
First here's hoping, uh, is that a Chiron beta cheer on beta prime was on your

02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:39.880
holiday rotation. Secondly,

02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:42.280
if any of you have any experience with doing this,

02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:46.600
does anyone there or in chat know how well an Xbox 360 controller works on Mac

02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:50.720
OS still a leopard or later? Finally, does Minecraft support said controller?

02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:53.480
I wouldn't know about the Mac side of it,

02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:57.320
but I can use the controller in Minecraft at all in Minecraft.

02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:59.280
I use the controller all the time in Minecraft. Oh yeah.

02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:03.680
I use keyboard when I play. Yeah, I believe that. I, in fact,

02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:06.080
if you play on our server, uh,

02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:09.400
or you just have access to the VOG network forums, uh, for PC,

02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:13.560
at least I have an expatter profile that you can use for the Xbox 360 controller

02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:18.160
that works perfectly and it works almost almost identical as the 360 version,

02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:22.120
but not quite. I'm fairly certain there are drivers available for Mac OS.

02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:25.920
And I know, uh, probably doesn't help this email or,

02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:29.400
but the PlayStation three controller actually works with Mac OS.

02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.560
Okay. And now I was told to stop reading this on the air immediately.

02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:36.120
This part of the email, no, I'm not going to go any further. Um,

02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.440
it actually is for me and I'm forwarding it to my personal email.

02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:42.120
So you'll hear from me there. Sounds kinky.

02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:48.160
Shut up, Rob. It was actually really nice. All right.

02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:52.440
I was just sort of trying. How does he know what you're wearing today? I'm just,

02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:53.480
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right.

02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:55.800
When do I ever wear something that isn't black?

02:57:57.560 --> 02:57:59.200
So you're saying they're black.

02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:02.040
Yes.

02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:06.080
Next email.

02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:13.120
I love tooling you guys. Seriously. All right. Two emails left.

02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:15.720
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:19.480
Now that it's cold on the East coast, I need another form of exercise. Well,

02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:23.600
I, we can't help you with that. Um, so I set up TDR in my unheated workshop.

02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:27.200
I was totally getting back into it and I noticed that my score sucked.

02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:31.240
I've played a few times since then and the left arrow works about 25% of the

02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:36.280
time. So Loki, do I buy, build or hang myself from frustration.

02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:40.760
I've researched a lot online and it's hard to find a good pad since they're not

02:58:40.760 --> 02:58:41.600
made anymore.

02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:46.280
Even the metal pads you can find on eBay and Amazon get so-so reviews and should

02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:50.120
I stockpile new pads since dance games are dead? What would you recommend?

02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:52.160
Keep in mind that I'm budget conscious.

02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:55.320
Good day citizens from your loyal turtle in Philly. Serious turtle.

02:58:55.720 --> 02:58:58.480
Well, depends on how much you're going to actually play. Cause um, you know,

02:58:58.480 --> 02:59:03.440
I remember I've looked into great detail for as pads go,

02:59:03.480 --> 02:59:05.400
but um, yeah, you're right. A lot of them,

02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:07.240
they're pretty terrible,

02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:10.880
but there are mods you can do on some of them to make them not so bad.

02:59:10.880 --> 02:59:14.760
Like some of the, uh, I'm trying to think what, what pads there,

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:19.560
but most of them even on the eBay and stuff are really overpriced for what they

02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:23.400
are. So, um, your best bet is just, uh,

02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:27.520
I mean you can make something. I've made a few different types of pads.

02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:28.680
The last one I did was the

02:59:28.680 --> 02:59:29.520
um,

02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:34.680
Riptide pad I think. And that one cost me,

02:59:34.680 --> 02:59:37.480
I think $300 for two.

02:59:37.880 --> 02:59:42.840
So that's not too bad. And um, if you only need one, it's even cheaper.

02:59:44.120 --> 02:59:46.640
Um, and it wasn't too bad. It just, it didn't ground it right.

02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:49.040
But now we're just going to remake the whole thing anyways. Cause I have,

02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:53.080
you know, some sheet metal sitting in my garage will shed. Um,

02:59:54.520 --> 02:59:57.760
I don't know. I, I'd go with the home built pad if you, if you can do that.

02:59:57.800 --> 03:00:01.080
Otherwise, um, you know, the metal pads are all right,

03:00:01.080 --> 03:00:02.920
but just make sure if you do get one, make,

03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:08.040
it's like a really thick pad cause I bought some metal pads are about an inch

03:00:08.720 --> 03:00:13.720
thick and they bent like it was really bad.

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:17.440
So just read reviews and you know,

03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:20.040
ask on like some of the music game form,

03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:24.560
especially people are using pads a lot. And I'd say as far as being, um, you know,

03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:29.280
music games aren't done. I mean, music console games are kind of dying,

03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:32.240
but if you want, you know, to do the PC, you know,

03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:34.520
simulator scene and that kind of stuff,

03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:38.280
you're going to have a lot more options available to you and that's probably not

03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:40.680
going to go away anytime soon. So that'd be the way to go.

03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:43.640
Alrighty.

03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:48.560
All right. And the last email then if we're ready. Hey, OLR crew,

03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:53.200
AZHP here with an option or two on the news stories last week about online

03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:56.280
services for games like Neverwinter Nights being shut down.

03:00:56.280 --> 03:00:58.640
Whereas Star Wars Battlefront for PS2 is still running.

03:00:58.960 --> 03:01:02.560
My quote friend who worked at GameSpy told me that when developers stopped

03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:04.680
paying their fees for their services to stay up,

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:09.200
GameSpy would just not shut them down. Um,

03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:11.920
because getting a massive uprising of players getting butthurt that their

03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:15.080
online games were getting shut down was more trouble to deal with than just

03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:18.560
leaving the service up. My guess is that Gloo Mobile,

03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:22.160
the company that bought GameSpy from IGN is realizing they've made a poor

03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:23.240
investment on GameSpy.

03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:27.560
They paid about 45 million in stock for GameSpy and the employees are jumping

03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:29.920
ship because they don't like the new direction Gloo is taking them,

03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:33.980
found out about this practice and is trying to write some developers out for

03:01:33.980 --> 03:01:37.560
games they've stopped paying for. And those developers are, surprise,

03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:41.200
not willing to pay for 10 year old games and are just letting them get shut

03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:45.240
down. Just my little insight into the world of video game business,

03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:46.800
you're truly AZHP.

03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:49.160
I don't think it was that they were giving up on them.

03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:52.400
It's just that they're raising the rates so much that it's just not cost,

03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:53.880
you know, effective for them. I mean,

03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:56.560
I think that's really what it comes down to.

03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:00.920
I found that part fascinating that they'd rather keep them running than have to

03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:04.400
deal with the internet rage. That says a lot right there.

03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:07.640
That was it.

03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:10.080
I'm eating.

03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:14.760
No help. We have dead air.

03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:16.160
Okay, Rob,

03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:20.360
jeez, you have to shove your face with stuff and have me fill in the time.

03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:23.920
Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris.

03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:26.640
I will keep saying Garris until Rob finishes chewing.

03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:30.800
How about FUs? Okay.

03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:42.960
My FU goes to AAA

03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:47.960
um, because of, um, claim issues from my car accident.

03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:50.360
I may not be in a bad spot,

03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:54.160
but somebody else who was involved in the accident, um, was

03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:00.400
for things that were proven on record to have been caused by the accident.

03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:03.920
So I'm going to take it up with them and they may be losing a customer.

03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:06.920
Loki.

03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:08.000
Um,

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.640
I guess FU to the fact that there's no one on Final Fantasy 11.

03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:14.160
It's kind of lonely. I mean,

03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:18.240
I like the fact that now I can actually camp the notorious monsters if I want to

03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:20.280
and be able to attack them.

03:03:20.440 --> 03:03:21.760
Leaping Lizzie's all yours.

03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:24.160
No, seriously. Like I ran across them away.

03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:27.320
Here's a notorious monster and we'll fight it. And I did and I killed it.

03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:30.600
And I didn't actually get the drop, but, um, I was like, yeah,

03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:31.440
that's kind of cool.

03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:36.480
Yeah, I noticed quite a few. Um, so it's neat. Um,

03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:38.800
and then of course, you know, uh, FU,

03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:42.320
the fact that I've got some big projects I want to work on and

03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:47.200
I've been just like brain fried lately and I just haven't been able to

03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:50.040
concentrate on them. But some major stuff hopefully,

03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:53.440
hopefully I'll actually work on this year. I really need to focus on it.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:56.440
All right.

03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:56.680
Uh,

03:03:56.680 --> 03:03:59.680
my FU of the week goes to my cohost for not knowing how to fill dead air when

03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:00.800
I'm eating. Uh,

03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:04.560
We didn't know you were getting food. Jeez, Rob. This is Rob.

03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:11.680
And FU to Dark Sakura for furthering berating me during my FU segment.

03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:15.960
Uh, and just FU to the fact that vacation is blown by.

03:04:15.960 --> 03:04:20.960
I have to go back to work on Wednesday. I know I have to go to work tomorrow.

03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:25.600
No, it sucks to be here. Why if I have a whole week off? Oh my gosh. But you know,

03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:29.720
no, in all seriousness, it's been a great mental break. So I'm like, I'm,

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.280
I'm actually at this point where I'm like, I'm re I'm,

03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:35.640
I'm looking forward to going back to work and taking care of all these projects

03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:40.000
I've got going on. That'll change a day later. FU to myself for me. No,

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.280
I do like my job though. I feel it's, you know,

03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:44.720
who doesn't like a break from their day job though,

03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:47.520
to go do whatever they want for a while. It's, it's a good mental rest,

03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:50.960
but I'm ready for 2013 to be a kick ass year.

03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:55.040
By the way, can I throw in a happy birthday to a celebrity? No. Yes.

03:04:55.840 --> 03:05:00.600
Michelle Nichols turned 80 today. She is a flawless goddess. She, she is,

03:05:00.680 --> 03:05:03.920
she is pretty damn flawless. I have to, she's one of,

03:05:03.920 --> 03:05:05.200
she's actually one of my,

03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:09.040
I would say the only flaw I could think of possibly for her was that she

03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:11.840
participated in season two of euros, but otherwise,

03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:16.240
otherwise she did a fan dance at 50.

03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:20.880
Yeah. All right. Uh, yeah.

03:05:20.880 --> 03:05:24.600
If you go vitamin water for making me pee like three times in two hours,

03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:25.960
I'm not a pregnant woman. I swear

03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:33.120
you're just getting old like the rest of us. It's vitamin water's fault about me.

03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:36.640
Your half birthday just recently passed too. Cause mine day I'm like, Oh,

03:05:36.680 --> 03:05:41.600
I'm almost 35. Yay. All right. Fun to be old. Yeah. All right.

03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:47.760
Let us get to one more segment before we get

03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:50.520
to the other classic game of the week.

03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:52.880
I'll explain in a minute and our Twitter topics and so forth.

03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:56.480
It is a segment we like to call listless.

03:05:56.480 --> 03:05:57.320
Okay.

03:06:04.840 --> 03:06:07.160
All right. The way listless works,

03:06:07.160 --> 03:06:09.400
we are going to put together the ultimate list.

03:06:09.400 --> 03:06:13.160
This is a very scientific process. Y'all the ultimate list.

03:06:13.560 --> 03:06:15.080
We're not going to have the theme music all night tonight.

03:06:15.200 --> 03:06:20.200
The ultimate list to discuss the top three of a topic and that topic tonight is

03:06:21.880 --> 03:06:25.840
your 2013 predictions. Ooh. Okay.

03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:28.040
So here's the way listless works.

03:06:28.040 --> 03:06:30.640
We're going to go around the room and the folks participating tonight are myself,

03:06:30.640 --> 03:06:34.560
Dark Sakura, Loki, Flacco, and Allen. We have a five man listless tonight.

03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:38.400
You have a four man and one woman listless.

03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:43.240
We have a five person. There's a woman man. So there you go.

03:06:43.480 --> 03:06:47.760
You know what? My man, my boobs dominate. All right, fine, fine.

03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:53.720
We have four men in a nag. Bitch, please. I will cut you.

03:06:54.720 --> 03:06:57.640
All right. Doing tonight's listless. Ah, you know, I love you. All right.

03:06:57.640 --> 03:06:58.520
We're doing tonight's listless.

03:06:58.520 --> 03:07:00.680
We're each going to go around and put three items on the list.

03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:02.440
Then we will go around and it's a really tough thing.

03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:04.360
We're going to take one answer off the list,

03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:08.040
but there's a twist in tonight's listless. This is,

03:07:08.120 --> 03:07:12.280
this is a listless twist for 2013. So.

03:07:12.280 --> 03:07:13.160
Twistless?

03:07:13.160 --> 03:07:17.480
It's twistless. Here's the deal, because there's so many people tonight.

03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:22.520
If somebody gets two of their answers taken from the list,

03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:27.080
their third answer automatically becomes immune and cannot be taken from the

03:07:27.080 --> 03:07:30.880
list. That's the twist. Immunity idol for an answer.

03:07:30.880 --> 03:07:33.000
So if you get two of your answers taken off the list,

03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:35.080
your other one cannot be eliminated.

03:07:35.080 --> 03:07:40.040
May I suggest that we play the, uh, the whole tribunal song,

03:07:40.040 --> 03:07:42.760
you know, while we're doing the eliminations,

03:07:42.760 --> 03:07:44.480
that might be kind of funny there.

03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:51.320
I'll see what we can do. All right. Um, so, uh, all right.

03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:56.080
So that's the twist this, this, uh, this year with listless 2.0. So anyway, uh,

03:07:56.120 --> 03:07:58.600
in all seriousness, let's go around and start forming the list.

03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:02.560
The chatters will then vote and they will get to put together the ultimate list

03:08:02.560 --> 03:08:05.200
by the way, and I will throw this out there.

03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:09.720
There actually is another upgrade coming to listless in 2013. Uh,

03:08:09.740 --> 03:08:11.520
not just the upgrade I previously mentioned,

03:08:11.520 --> 03:08:14.640
but we are going to have a way that podcast listeners can participate in this

03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:17.320
segment next year. So stay tuned.

03:08:17.320 --> 03:08:20.920
We are going to do one segment where the podcasters get to participate as well.

03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:25.320
Uh, in 2013. So expect this segment to come back. All right. Anyhow,

03:08:25.480 --> 03:08:28.800
it is your predictions in gaming for 2013.

03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:32.240
This can be as serious or as silly as you want. Chatters,

03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:35.440
we may look to you for some answers as some good ones get duplicated.

03:08:35.560 --> 03:08:39.680
So serious or silly as you want your 2013 predictions.

03:08:39.920 --> 03:08:42.040
We might,

03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:45.200
I predict that I will get through a sentence without coughing or something.

03:08:45.440 --> 03:08:48.040
All right, let's, uh, let's go around dark Sakura.

03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:51.520
What is your number three answer for your 2013 prediction?

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:55.440
Reggie Fils-Aime will actually reveal that he's Donkey Kong. Just shaved.

03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:04.520
And why do you believe this will happen?

03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:08.400
Look at the man's face. He's got gorilla face.

03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:13.240
And like not Damon Auburn, Jamie Hewlett gorillas. I mean, he,

03:09:13.400 --> 03:09:14.480
he looks like a monkey.

03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:19.360
All right. Wow. I don't know. I don't know. That's, uh,

03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:23.400
I don't know. I don't know. That one might get eliminated right off. We'll see.

03:09:23.640 --> 03:09:27.080
All right. Let's see though. Uh, moving around the list. Loki,

03:09:27.080 --> 03:09:29.840
what is your number three answer for 2013 prediction?

03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:31.600
Final Fantasy 11 will go free to play.

03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:39.120
And why do you feel that's destined to happen this year?

03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:44.040
Because there's very few servers right now and they're

03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:47.240
hardly anyone on them. And honestly, if they went free to play,

03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:48.760
I think they would get a lot more revenue.

03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:52.480
All right. And I understand the, you know,

03:09:52.480 --> 03:09:55.320
they have Final Fantasy 14 over there and they want kind of people to go to

03:09:55.320 --> 03:09:58.560
that, but why wouldn't you want to keep your old service available? I guess it,

03:09:58.560 --> 03:10:02.200
maybe, maybe not the cut into your new one. I don't know. As hard as that.

03:10:03.560 --> 03:10:08.080
All right. Uh, Flaco Jones, what is your number three answer?

03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:09.080
Uh,

03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:12.360
PlayStation and Vita versions of first party Sony games are actually going to be

03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:15.840
made by the same developers. Oh,

03:10:15.840 --> 03:10:18.760
instead of like the whole like license thing, like, well,

03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:21.840
just like the whole, like, uh, uh, yeah, like uncharted,

03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:24.840
naughty dog doesn't do the Vita version or a little big planet.

03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:26.640
Meaty medical doesn't do the Vita version.

03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:29.880
Just stop pawning it off on one of your other developers.

03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:35.480
That makes a lot of sense. Actually. I am like totally okay with that. All right.

03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:40.240
Um, moving on. Uh, let's go to Alan,

03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:43.840
if we can with his number three answer. Where did he go? He's over there.

03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:45.640
Hello.

03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:51.680
The devil may cry reboot will flop and bury the franchise for good.

03:10:52.120 --> 03:10:55.680
The only good thing it will bring is really hot fan art of new Dante and Chris

03:10:55.680 --> 03:11:00.560
Redfield. So there you go. The number three answer from Allen,

03:11:00.560 --> 03:11:05.040
devil may cry reboot flops and the only good thing it brings is a fanfic.

03:11:05.880 --> 03:11:09.640
All right. Uh, my number three answer, what did I do my list here? Oh,

03:11:09.680 --> 03:11:14.560
my number three answer is that there will be a Vita price drop before the

03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:17.640
one year anniversary, which is in a couple of months. And I honestly,

03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:20.120
I don't think they have any choice at this point.

03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:24.640
And I would almost go so far as to say the three G one gets eliminated totally.

03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:26.720
Cause why? But, uh,

03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:29.200
I'm just going to say a price drop for the Vita.

03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:32.600
And I don't think that's just wishful thinking because you're not getting a Vita

03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:37.000
till the price drop. Right? I mean, I already missed the, the, the, the posts,

03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:41.600
the black Friday deal, which is 180. So unless it's lower than 180, yeah,

03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:45.720
I'm not buying it. It won't just be the three DS that gets that.

03:11:46.240 --> 03:11:50.280
All right, let's go to dark Sakura with her number two answer.

03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:54.280
Mass effect fans will get all butthurt because, um,

03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:58.200
the rumor about the DLC, uh, proving indoctrination theory is true.

03:12:01.240 --> 03:12:04.960
So, um, DLC indoctrination is true. Yeah.

03:12:05.640 --> 03:12:08.080
And of course, you know, all the fans will get butthurt.

03:12:08.280 --> 03:12:12.120
I'll probably be a bit butthurt for those that are not in tapped into the fandom

03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:16.880
briefly described what the indoctrination theory is without spoiling the ending.

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:20.400
Uh, not much basically. Okay.

03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:23.520
There's this thing where there's like a kind of mind control in the game for

03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:25.240
people who've been around Reaper technology a lot.

03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:27.640
And the Reapers are the big bad guys. And, um,

03:12:27.640 --> 03:12:30.920
basically they can kind of make you do whatever they want you to and think

03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:34.040
whatever they want you to think. So maybe the whole ending was hallucinated.

03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:39.760
Fair enough. All right. Uh,

03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:42.600
let's move on to Loki. Your number two answer.

03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:48.120
Bandit two will flop and the only good thing you'll get from it is fanfic.

03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:53.240
Well, didn't I just hear that?

03:12:57.200 --> 03:13:01.320
And because of the Wii U and you think you had trouble with niche games on the

03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:04.600
Wii, you haven't seen anything yet. All right. So, uh,

03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:07.920
Flaco Jones, what is your number two answer?

03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:11.320
The next generation Xbox, the lube, uh,

03:13:11.360 --> 03:13:15.320
will be a hundred dollars if you sign up for a two year cell phone style

03:13:15.320 --> 03:13:19.720
commitment and pay a higher tier of Xbox lives, say like 15 bucks a month.

03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:22.480
That answer.

03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:27.320
I hate that answer because it is so probably true. Like, Oh my God,

03:13:27.320 --> 03:13:31.840
I, Oh, I hate you for saying that because like I could see that happening X.

03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:34.320
So you're basically saying Xbox lube goes the way the iPhone.

03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:39.040
It's just 99 99 with a two year commitment to Xbox live. Yeah.

03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:43.480
But then even X, yeah, platinum. Exactly what I was thinking. Oh, you Dick.

03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:47.960
All right. Alan, your number two answer.

03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:53.680
Watchdogs and Bioshock infinite will destroy everyone else's asshole as far as

03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:54.880
gaming the year lists.

03:13:56.480 --> 03:13:58.920
The only beat the two games that everyone loses their mind over.

03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:02.760
What about, what about bungees destiny?

03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:04.080
That was the other one I was thinking of.

03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:07.760
That's supposed to be a real like asshole blower. I guess if I'm used to use,

03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:11.280
that's not coming up this year. Salacious pop turn or 2013.

03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:13.960
You don't think so? No. All right. It's not even close.

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:17.200
You think it's either pushing it back. They're pushing it back to the next,

03:14:17.240 --> 03:14:22.120
next 2014. All right. Uh, going to who's left me.

03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:26.680
My number two answer, my number two answer for 2013 prediction is, uh,

03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:30.120
final fantasy 14 reborn. Not bad.

03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:37.680
You know what? That one's not fair. Why? I can't say why.

03:14:38.520 --> 03:14:41.440
Well, it's a, it's a prediction. Final Fantasy 14 reborn.

03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:44.880
Turns out to not be that bad. And it's the first time they've ever, uh,

03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:49.760
reversed course on an MMO and it works. We'll see. All right.

03:14:50.200 --> 03:14:54.320
Uh, so, so far we have Reggie reveals he's actually donkey Kong.

03:14:54.520 --> 03:14:58.840
Final fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita ports made by the same developers.

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.080
Devil may cry. Reboot flops.

03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:05.360
Vita price drop before the one year anniversary indoctrination DLC ending,

03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:09.400
but hurts mass effect fans. Bayonetta two will flop, but yay fanfic.

03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:12.480
The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with a commitment.

03:15:12.800 --> 03:15:16.160
Watchdogs and bio shocks blows up game of the year lists and other things.

03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:20.200
Final fantasy 14 reborn. Not bad gift. All right,

03:15:20.220 --> 03:15:24.520
so now we get down to the number one answers.

03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:28.200
Dark sahara compile will rise from the ashes,

03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:32.320
not as compile heart and bring us a new guard at game.

03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:36.980
As in guard at guy den was the guardian legend.

03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:41.520
One of these years, I'd like you to be right. All right. Uh, Loki,

03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:43.800
your number one answer that we is going to flop.

03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:47.080
And the reason I say that is because they haven't,

03:15:47.120 --> 03:15:50.140
they're not going to have any good games coming out and I'm not talking about

03:15:50.140 --> 03:15:53.720
Pikmin. Yeah. Some people like Pikmin, but Pikmin does not fucking sell systems.

03:15:54.240 --> 03:15:58.520
Okay. I'm talking about like Mario, Zelda, not until fourth quarter,

03:15:58.720 --> 03:16:03.320
2013 and so basically you're going to have a big nine month dead period,

03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:08.440
at least more than nine months where it's just going to dip down to nothing

03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:12.120
because it's not selling like hotcakes now they're on. I mean,

03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:16.440
don't get me wrong. They've got lots of systems out there right now. Um,

03:16:16.480 --> 03:16:19.400
or at least there's, you know, we don't know how many systems they have out there,

03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:20.760
but they're not,

03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:25.580
they're not selling out and that's not good to not be selling out right now.

03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:27.760
And then granted, I know their supplies a little better,

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:32.020
but it's not that much better. You just popped in my head. Hmm. Flippity,

03:16:32.020 --> 03:16:36.600
floppy. We use on its way. Flocko Jones,

03:16:36.620 --> 03:16:41.280
your number one prediction for 2013 a skyward sword will be ported to the Wii U

03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:45.080
replacing the innovative motion control with innovative touch control.

03:16:46.680 --> 03:16:48.240
When you're talking about motion control,

03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:50.880
they're just going to do motion control with the game pad.

03:16:50.880 --> 03:16:53.720
It'll be the exact fucking thing again.

03:16:54.400 --> 03:16:58.280
Skyward have to use the screen skyward sword to the Wii U with touch control.

03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:02.680
It's new control skyward sword. Yes. All right. Fair enough. Alan,

03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:04.760
your number one answer.

03:17:05.520 --> 03:17:10.140
BioWare will continue to support mass effect free multiplayer with DLC and

03:17:10.140 --> 03:17:13.680
weekend events through at least June.

03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:16.720
I would like that to be true.

03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:20.640
All right. From a true fan boy,

03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:24.320
I was still getting my regular updates through June. All right.

03:17:25.680 --> 03:17:27.720
All right. And my number one answer,

03:17:28.360 --> 03:17:31.760
the last one for the list before we do the elimination rounds,

03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:37.200
no PlayStation four this year.

03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:41.040
I think everybody's expecting it to happen. I don't think it will.

03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:44.320
That's a very serious reply. I think the new X-Box will happen.

03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:48.320
I don't think Sony Sony needs to recover on the Vita right now.

03:17:48.400 --> 03:17:51.000
I don't think they're under any pressure to get the PlayStation four out.

03:17:52.080 --> 03:17:54.640
Try to learn from the Wii U and the X-Box launches.

03:17:54.680 --> 03:17:58.480
I think it's the smart thing to wait if you're Sony, but we'll see.

03:17:58.560 --> 03:18:02.160
I say no PlayStation four in 2013. All right.

03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:06.040
So there it is 15 things on the damn list right now.

03:18:06.400 --> 03:18:11.040
Reggie is donkey Kong. Final Fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita ports made by the

03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:14.800
same developers as PS three devil may cry. Reboot flops.

03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:18.800
Beat a price drop before the one year anniversary DLC indoctrination ending,

03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:22.360
but hurts mass effect fans Bayonetta two flops, but fanfic.

03:18:22.600 --> 03:18:26.240
The X-Box lube is a hundred dollars with the commitment watchdogs and bio shot

03:18:26.240 --> 03:18:29.460
game of the year list final fantasy reborn. Not bad.

03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:33.120
JPG compile will rise from the ashes with a new guard at game.

03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:38.280
Wii U will flop skyward sword goes to Wii U with touch control mass effect

03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:42.240
multiplayer through June and no PlayStation four.

03:18:42.440 --> 03:18:46.640
Now we get to the very tough part of the round.

03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:55.960
All right. That's actually not the music I would have used.

03:18:56.840 --> 03:18:59.440
Some of these YouTube's are labeled very strangely.

03:18:59.600 --> 03:19:03.760
Let's do this theme song here. Let's try this for the vote off.

03:19:05.360 --> 03:19:06.200
Much better.

03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:11.000
All right, so here we are at tribal council.

03:19:12.880 --> 03:19:17.240
Will you tell me about how Russell wronged you and how you're going to vote his

03:19:17.240 --> 03:19:20.160
ass out tonight? All right, for real. Here we go.

03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:23.160
Going around and eliminating items that are not worthy of the list.

03:19:23.160 --> 03:19:26.320
Remember if two of a person's items get eliminated,

03:19:26.320 --> 03:19:29.160
the third answer becomes immune. So dark soccer,

03:19:29.160 --> 03:19:30.680
which of these is not worthy of the list?

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:35.720
Um, sorry, Alan.

03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:40.000
I'm going to take out the devil may cry reboot because there is such a huge fan

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.640
base that it will make its money back just from fan base alone.

03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:45.440
But the fanfic, dark soccer, the fanfic.

03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:48.400
Yeah, the fanfic will happen regardless.

03:19:49.160 --> 03:19:53.120
People will still buy the game. I bought orphan Rob.

03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:55.840
It doesn't take a miss Clio to predict. I bought orphan. All right.

03:19:55.880 --> 03:19:59.360
Hey, you played a demo yet? Fair enough. Huh? Uh, I've seen it.

03:19:59.360 --> 03:20:03.840
I haven't played it myself. Dante's pretty hot. Don't get me wrong. All right.

03:20:03.920 --> 03:20:08.640
Uh, who is next? Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list? Um,

03:20:08.760 --> 03:20:10.800
I'm going to have to say,

03:20:13.960 --> 03:20:16.840
uh, compile it. It's just, it's not, it's not going to happen.

03:20:16.840 --> 03:20:20.600
We've got to be real here. All right. Compile rising from the ashes.

03:20:20.640 --> 03:20:23.960
It just ain't happening. It's a wonderful pipe dream, but it's just,

03:20:23.960 --> 03:20:27.040
it's not going to happen. All right. Fair enough. Uh,

03:20:27.080 --> 03:20:31.600
then we will go to a Flaco. Which of these is not worthy of the list?

03:20:31.840 --> 03:20:34.680
I can't decide cause they're all going to happen. Um,

03:20:35.400 --> 03:20:39.920
I guess I'll just have to give dark soccer immunity and say indoctrination.

03:20:40.200 --> 03:20:41.920
You're going to take indoctrination off the list.

03:20:42.200 --> 03:20:46.520
You're going to give Reggie is actually a shaved donkey Kong immunity because I'm

03:20:46.520 --> 03:20:47.360
a little,

03:20:47.480 --> 03:20:50.760
there's something about that answer that worries me a little bit.

03:20:51.160 --> 03:20:54.520
I don't want to go there. Other people agree with me, but uh,

03:20:55.680 --> 03:20:59.360
I think he looks like a gorilla. I know.

03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:02.240
I really want to just get that answer off the list.

03:21:02.240 --> 03:21:05.680
I don't want to give an immunity. So Flaco, I'm going to really change my answer.

03:21:05.680 --> 03:21:09.480
Thank you. So you're changing your answer. Reggie. All right. That's a good,

03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:14.280
that's a good mass effect. All right. So that gets immunity.

03:21:14.280 --> 03:21:17.680
So mass effect gets immunity. There we go. I should have added that, you know,

03:21:17.680 --> 03:21:21.560
what was it? Um, who was it that they always have during those? Uh,

03:21:22.520 --> 03:21:24.120
Oh, it's a water.

03:21:24.200 --> 03:21:26.600
It was going to be holding like a human head the next, uh,

03:21:26.640 --> 03:21:29.240
Nintendo conference thing that they do because he's always holding,

03:21:29.240 --> 03:21:31.280
something weird, like a banana or some weird shit.

03:21:33.960 --> 03:21:38.200
Universe of difference between a banana and a head, maybe a shrunken head. Yeah,

03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:41.840
but it's weird though. He's just like putting it out into the crowd. Think of it.

03:21:41.880 --> 03:21:45.120
Think of it this way. Flaco, uh,

03:21:45.160 --> 03:21:49.160
mass effect fans getting butt hurt by something. That's a given that will

03:21:49.160 --> 03:21:52.360
happen. So, you know, I don't, I don't know if you should eliminate it. All right.

03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:55.840
Anyhow, let's go. It has immunity. Yeah, it has immunity. All right. Uh,

03:21:55.880 --> 03:21:58.400
let's go to Alan. Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:03.560
So generally whenever I eliminate something, the chat room hates me.

03:22:03.560 --> 03:22:07.720
So I'm really going to try and keep the more controversial ones up and get rid of

03:22:07.720 --> 03:22:08.800
the more normal ones.

03:22:09.800 --> 03:22:14.800
I'm going to take off final fantasy 14 reborn isn't bad.

03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:19.960
Maybe perhaps have some bias. I don't know.

03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:26.360
You think it will be bad. All right. That's fair. That's fair. All right. Uh,

03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:29.280
what? I was gonna say some bias of the person who said that statement.

03:22:30.760 --> 03:22:33.160
All right. Uh, then that leaves me.

03:22:33.160 --> 03:22:36.040
So which of Alan's answers should I get rid of? No. Uh, all right.

03:22:36.040 --> 03:22:39.040
So my turn to figure out which of these is not worthy of list. Um,

03:22:40.840 --> 03:22:45.320
um, oh, did you not get rid of them? I did. You did. Okay. Uh,

03:22:45.320 --> 03:22:46.760
I'm going to get rid of, um,

03:22:50.320 --> 03:22:54.840
I don't know. Uh, it's all going to happen. They're all going to happen.

03:22:54.840 --> 03:22:56.960
They really are. Um, okay.

03:22:56.960 --> 03:23:00.000
I'm going to get rid of Vita ports are made by the same developers.

03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:03.760
Cause that's not going to happen. That's never going to happen. That's true.

03:23:04.120 --> 03:23:05.800
It would happen if they actually wanted to save the Vita.

03:23:07.280 --> 03:23:10.120
Yeah. They really wanted to save the Vita maybe, but no,

03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:11.280
that's not what's going to happen. All right.

03:23:11.440 --> 03:23:13.680
So here's the ones you can actually vote on.

03:23:13.680 --> 03:23:18.680
We have final fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita price drop before the one year

03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:23.320
anniversary DLC indoctrination ending, but hurts mass effect fans.

03:23:23.360 --> 03:23:26.560
I kind of butchered the grammar there. Sorry. Bayonetta two will flop,

03:23:26.600 --> 03:23:30.280
but fanfic. The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with commitment.

03:23:30.480 --> 03:23:33.420
Watchdogs and bio shear trample game of the year list.

03:23:33.560 --> 03:23:38.320
We you will flop skyward sword goes to Wii U with touch control mass effect

03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:41.560
multiplayer through June, which I, that's the one I really should got rid of.

03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:45.520
Oh well. And uh, no PlayStation four. So there it is.

03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:48.100
You guys can place your vote now.

03:23:48.100 --> 03:23:52.340
Send you private message to Rob Roberts in the chat room with your number one

03:23:52.340 --> 03:23:56.420
and your number two answers for which of those you think will be the case.

03:23:56.740 --> 03:23:59.900
And we will tally up the results and get to that at the end of the show.

03:24:01.100 --> 03:24:03.820
All right. Thanks for playing guys.

03:24:07.220 --> 03:24:10.820
Here's your immunity idol for playing. All right. For life.

03:24:10.860 --> 03:24:13.380
It's your immunity idol for life, for life.

03:24:13.620 --> 03:24:16.300
She's the only one that got an immunity. Yeah.

03:24:16.300 --> 03:24:19.940
She's the only one that got an immunity this time. I think,

03:24:19.940 --> 03:24:24.940
I think I should have a queen hat or chocolate.

03:24:26.540 --> 03:24:29.100
Okay. Alan, sit on Jamie's head. All right.

03:24:34.460 --> 03:24:37.700
All right. Uh, what does that leave for the segments here? Oh, we've got,

03:24:37.700 --> 03:24:38.620
we got to do this.

03:24:38.620 --> 03:24:43.620
We have to do a very anticipated moment here in 2012 because remember when the

03:24:44.780 --> 03:24:48.660
power went out during the last show that Flaco Jones was on,

03:24:48.980 --> 03:24:51.420
his segment got cut and he never got to do it.

03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:53.940
And literally he was in the middle of segment talking about it like this.

03:24:53.940 --> 03:24:59.780
And then he's like sad because the dark.

03:25:00.020 --> 03:25:03.680
All right, so we are going to allow Flaco Jones tonight. Yes,

03:25:03.680 --> 03:25:05.580
we're going to do two of these segments this week.

03:25:05.740 --> 03:25:09.380
We're going to allow him to do his makeup classic game of the week tonight.

03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:14.380
So making up for the show that was lost in May Flaco Jones,

03:25:14.820 --> 03:25:17.100
what is your classic game of the week?

03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:22.100
My classic game of last May is Chrono Cross.

03:25:22.900 --> 03:25:26.660
Yay. Good pick. Really good opening theme.

03:25:27.300 --> 03:25:31.060
Amazing. I have to find actually a Chrono Cross video.

03:25:32.060 --> 03:25:35.620
One song in there that I really liked. The girls do something in the stars.

03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:40.020
Yeah. Yeah. That's. And it was an S word. And I was like, stole? Yeah.

03:25:40.500 --> 03:25:43.500
Is that the ending title theme? I don't remember.

03:25:44.500 --> 03:25:47.260
I just know that it's a piece I really liked from that game.

03:25:47.340 --> 03:25:49.540
My wife got me the soundtrack last Christmas.

03:25:52.820 --> 03:25:55.980
Well, here you go. So you can all enjoy.

03:25:57.820 --> 03:26:00.700
Yay. Which was the best part of the game. Oh, come on.

03:26:01.900 --> 03:26:05.660
One of the best parts of the many best parts of the game. If that makes sense.

03:26:05.980 --> 03:26:10.140
All right. May by square in 1999 for Japan, 2000 for North America.

03:26:10.260 --> 03:26:12.700
It's technically the third game in the Chrono series,

03:26:12.700 --> 03:26:17.100
followed by Chrono Trigger 95 and the Japanese only text based game,

03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:19.580
Radical Dreamers 1996.

03:26:19.580 --> 03:26:22.020
It's set 20 years after the events in Chrono Trigger.

03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:26.580
The game focuses on Surge, this kid who stumbles into an alternate dimension

03:26:26.580 --> 03:26:29.860
where he died 10 years earlier and created a schism in the timeline

03:26:29.860 --> 03:26:32.580
that was saved by your party in Chrono Trigger.

03:26:33.340 --> 03:26:36.700
He teams up with a mysterious thief named Kid on a mission to stop

03:26:36.740 --> 03:26:39.460
a demi human named Links who is trying to use

03:26:39.700 --> 03:26:42.980
Surge's displacement in time for his own evil purposes.

03:26:43.420 --> 03:26:46.060
So as you play through the game, like one of the coolest parts

03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:48.780
is you get to have a lot of people in your party.

03:26:48.780 --> 03:26:50.700
Now, it's only like the typical three person party,

03:26:50.860 --> 03:26:53.900
but you can recruit up to 45 people and swap them in and out

03:26:54.460 --> 03:26:56.060
pretty much however you please.

03:26:56.060 --> 03:26:58.980
And they all have different, you know, base powers and things like that.

03:27:00.140 --> 03:27:03.020
But the only way to obtain all 45 of those characters is to play

03:27:03.380 --> 03:27:05.540
through the game three times.

03:27:05.540 --> 03:27:08.540
And I beat this game five times, so I've gotten all the characters.

03:27:10.820 --> 03:27:14.020
A lot of them have their own unique little dialog quirks to do this.

03:27:14.020 --> 03:27:17.180
They coded a script generator to change the standard dialog

03:27:17.180 --> 03:27:19.340
for all these special characters so they wouldn't have to rewrite

03:27:19.580 --> 03:27:21.940
and translate for all the different ones.

03:27:21.940 --> 03:27:25.620
Another way that the Chrono Cross makes having so many playable characters work

03:27:25.820 --> 03:27:29.340
is that it's a grind free RPG so you don't have to go grind all your characters.

03:27:29.780 --> 03:27:32.140
Every recruit levels up after killing a boss

03:27:32.380 --> 03:27:34.820
or fighting other key battles where you're rewarded with a star.

03:27:34.820 --> 03:27:37.580
So every time you get a star, your whole party bumps up a level.

03:27:37.580 --> 03:27:39.820
And that's kind of that's just another thing I love about the game.

03:27:39.820 --> 03:27:42.780
I love that it's not your typical grindy JRPG.

03:27:42.780 --> 03:27:46.340
You play through the game, boss to boss, and your party will always level.

03:27:46.340 --> 03:27:48.780
You don't sit there and grind little rabbits in the field.

03:27:49.940 --> 03:27:52.060
See, they also built the battle system from the ground up.

03:27:52.060 --> 03:27:56.300
It doesn't use magic points because as you attack, you use stamina points.

03:27:56.540 --> 03:27:57.700
And with each successful attack,

03:27:57.700 --> 03:28:01.340
you gain access to higher tiered elements on your elemental grid.

03:28:01.900 --> 03:28:04.660
Each element is tied to a color that affects the field of battle.

03:28:04.820 --> 03:28:08.340
And those are tied to like basic elements, you know, like fire and water,

03:28:08.900 --> 03:28:12.860
nature, earth and something else.

03:28:14.140 --> 03:28:17.660
Let's see, based on how you manipulate the field, you can do more damage.

03:28:17.980 --> 03:28:22.460
And that's kind of received some flack for the game

03:28:22.460 --> 03:28:26.780
because it is easy in that sense, along with the whole grind free aspect of it.

03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:29.500
The combat system is pretty easy to figure out.

03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:32.540
And once you do and you can just manipulate the field,

03:28:32.540 --> 03:28:34.940
you can own stuff like super fast in this game.

03:28:35.820 --> 03:28:40.260
Let's see, it received extremely well by critics.

03:28:40.860 --> 03:28:45.500
It had a perfect 10 on GameSpot, 36 out of 40 on Famitsu and 97 on IGN.

03:28:46.940 --> 03:28:48.940
The game shipped over a million and a half copies

03:28:48.940 --> 03:28:50.940
and was rereleased as a greatest hits version.

03:28:51.300 --> 03:28:54.180
It does have plenty of detractors, with the most common complaint

03:28:54.180 --> 03:28:56.580
being it isn't Chrono Trigger 2.

03:28:56.580 --> 03:28:59.620
The game's creators never intended it to be a true sequel to Chrono Trigger

03:28:59.860 --> 03:29:04.300
as they wanted to build a new game from the ground up for this new platform.

03:29:04.300 --> 03:29:07.740
You know, the PlayStation one that were not new at that point,

03:29:07.740 --> 03:29:09.780
but new compared to Chrono Trigger.

03:29:09.780 --> 03:29:11.980
They wanted they didn't want to just have another game

03:29:11.980 --> 03:29:14.940
that looked like Chrono Trigger playing on the the PlayStation.

03:29:16.020 --> 03:29:19.380
Well, plus, there was such a difference between Final Fantasy six and seven.

03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:21.620
You know, Chrono made a very similar kind of jump.

03:29:21.860 --> 03:29:25.220
And you know, in the game, I think also pissed off a lot of fans

03:29:25.220 --> 03:29:29.620
because as you play the game, you realize some characters from Chrono Trigger died.

03:29:29.940 --> 03:29:32.620
So you're like, oh, so that means there probably can never be a true

03:29:32.620 --> 03:29:35.100
Chrono Trigger 2 because this person's dead.

03:29:35.100 --> 03:29:36.140
But, you know, it's time travel.

03:29:36.140 --> 03:29:39.300
So you never know. Chrono Trigger could come back maybe someday.

03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:40.300
They could do whatever they want.

03:29:40.300 --> 03:29:41.380
They could do whatever they want.

03:29:41.380 --> 03:29:43.860
It's time travel and it's magic and who cares?

03:29:44.460 --> 03:29:47.220
It's still a great game. Let's see.

03:29:47.220 --> 03:29:51.260
Oh, yeah. OK. And then this is what I was going to end on was the music is the best.

03:29:51.820 --> 03:29:53.220
Nobody can really complain about that.

03:29:53.220 --> 03:29:54.420
It's my favorite part of the game.

03:29:54.420 --> 03:29:56.340
And I got the soundtrack.

03:29:56.340 --> 03:29:58.580
Like I said, the highlights are time scar.

03:29:58.740 --> 03:30:00.340
And I love magical dreamers.

03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:01.660
I love the end credits song.

03:30:01.940 --> 03:30:05.780
And yeah, just the kind of game you can just sit and listen to the music to.

03:30:05.780 --> 03:30:09.260
If you you can just leave it on that menu screen and just let it go.

03:30:09.540 --> 03:30:11.180
And that's just time scar over and over and over.

03:30:11.180 --> 03:30:12.700
Attract mode. Yeah.

03:30:12.700 --> 03:30:16.140
On Chrono Trigger, I used to let it sit in zeal

03:30:16.620 --> 03:30:19.300
and just play that music over and over again.

03:30:19.580 --> 03:30:21.220
And Charlotte's music.

03:30:21.220 --> 03:30:22.860
Yeah. Oh, Charlotte seems my favorite.

03:30:22.860 --> 03:30:24.460
Yeah. I love that.

03:30:24.460 --> 03:30:26.460
They kept just that awesome.

03:30:26.460 --> 03:30:30.180
This musical style was it kept the same style, at least.

03:30:30.420 --> 03:30:32.500
And she plays a big role in Chrono Cross.

03:30:33.300 --> 03:30:35.220
You know, I never got that far into it.

03:30:35.220 --> 03:30:36.980
Oh, you know what, though?

03:30:36.980 --> 03:30:41.700
But I've got another it's another critique of the game that it's almost like they

03:30:41.700 --> 03:30:45.420
didn't they could have changed one little thing about a certain character in Chrono

03:30:45.420 --> 03:30:47.100
Cross, and I think it would have made a huge difference

03:30:47.820 --> 03:30:50.340
to maybe fans of Chrono Trigger and Charlotte.

03:30:51.220 --> 03:30:52.580
But I guess you got to play it.

03:30:52.580 --> 03:30:55.940
I'm not going to spoil it, even though this game is like 12 years old or whatever.

03:30:56.580 --> 03:30:57.740
All right. Well, there it is.

03:30:57.740 --> 03:31:01.300
Your classic game of the May classic game in the May Chrono Cross.

03:31:01.300 --> 03:31:02.020
Thank you for that.

03:31:02.020 --> 03:31:04.220
I'm glad you finally got to give give the game.

03:31:04.220 --> 03:31:06.340
It's due here. I love this game.

03:31:06.340 --> 03:31:09.620
I know we all love the game.

03:31:09.620 --> 03:31:10.820
We're going to open up the Skype line.

03:31:10.820 --> 03:31:13.780
We don't have a whole lot of time for calls tonight because we're running very long.

03:31:13.780 --> 03:31:15.380
It's damn near a four hour show tonight.

03:31:15.380 --> 03:31:18.180
So one eight seven seven game O.L.R.

03:31:18.180 --> 03:31:20.020
or is your name on Skype is Orange Laundry.

03:31:20.020 --> 03:31:22.020
All one word. If you want to give us a call

03:31:22.020 --> 03:31:25.340
and we will take some of your calls, we will do the listless results here shortly.

03:31:25.340 --> 03:31:27.540
I just want to give it one more minute for votes

03:31:27.820 --> 03:31:29.820
because we have a massive tie going on right now.

03:31:29.820 --> 03:31:31.460
So I just want to see if that tie will get broken.

03:31:31.460 --> 03:31:33.700
But it doesn't look likely at this point.

03:31:33.700 --> 03:31:34.500
So we'll see.

03:31:34.500 --> 03:31:38.300
I'm also going to do tweets real quick here at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R..

03:31:38.780 --> 03:31:40.300
But I need my iPad for that.

03:31:40.300 --> 03:31:42.100
So, Loki, do you have any last minute story?

03:31:42.100 --> 03:31:43.780
Probably not, huh? No, I do.

03:31:43.780 --> 03:31:45.700
Oh, OK. I have one.

03:31:45.700 --> 03:31:48.860
Oh, Rob, see, this is kind of this is kind of sad, actually.

03:31:49.140 --> 03:31:50.500
You may remember the last few years.

03:31:50.500 --> 03:31:53.140
We haven't had a new NBA game, NBA elite.

03:31:53.140 --> 03:31:59.020
Well, NBA, NBA, NBA game like NBA live or NBA elite or whatever you can call it.

03:31:59.660 --> 03:32:04.020
So NBA Live 10, the last NBA game released by EA

03:32:04.620 --> 03:32:08.460
is going to have its online support shut down January 11th.

03:32:09.220 --> 03:32:13.220
So if you're still playing NBA live, you're done.

03:32:13.220 --> 03:32:16.300
But go act really angry on the Internet, because apparently that works.

03:32:16.300 --> 03:32:17.700
It worked with GameSpy.

03:32:17.700 --> 03:32:20.140
You never know. All right. We have a call on the line. Let's get to it.

03:32:20.140 --> 03:32:23.020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hello, it's Shane.

03:32:23.020 --> 03:32:25.220
Hey, Shane, how you doing? I'm good.

03:32:25.540 --> 03:32:28.420
Did you like the Konami stories that Jim was telling us earlier?

03:32:28.420 --> 03:32:32.380
There are so many other ones that are really funny that he missed.

03:32:32.380 --> 03:32:35.620
Like the fact there was the one guy

03:32:35.620 --> 03:32:38.700
when we were doing karaoke revolution that couldn't sing at all.

03:32:39.060 --> 03:32:41.980
And nobody could be in the same room with him while he tested

03:32:41.980 --> 03:32:43.700
because we would all laugh too hard.

03:32:43.700 --> 03:32:46.860
So we'd have to go other places like me and one of the guys had to go

03:32:46.860 --> 03:32:49.780
in the storage closet because we wanted to laugh so hard at it.

03:32:51.140 --> 03:32:52.260
I forgot about that.

03:32:52.260 --> 03:32:54.580
There was a guy that was so bad at karaoke revolution.

03:32:54.580 --> 03:32:57.860
It sent you back in the closet. Yes. All right. Amazing.

03:32:57.860 --> 03:33:00.380
All right. What did you really call in to talk about tonight?

03:33:00.380 --> 03:33:04.100
One, you did not pick the right number one for your list list

03:33:04.100 --> 03:33:07.740
as I gave you a better number one that is probably more likely to happen

03:33:07.740 --> 03:33:11.020
than anything on the list list. What would what would that answer be?

03:33:11.940 --> 03:33:15.540
Verbatim, I put your number one will be Shane will find a game

03:33:15.540 --> 03:33:19.020
he loves and gets Rob and Jamie to fall madly in love with it as well.

03:33:20.900 --> 03:33:23.540
Only if it's more mass effect.

03:33:23.540 --> 03:33:27.380
That's what you say now until I find something he's trying with persona

03:33:27.380 --> 03:33:28.940
and I'm like, no, no, not yet.

03:33:28.940 --> 03:33:32.900
I will not try yet until I beat it, but it will happen. Whatever.

03:33:33.460 --> 03:33:34.420
It's really, really good.

03:33:34.420 --> 03:33:35.780
Not worked with Skylanders.

03:33:35.780 --> 03:33:36.540
I'm not doing that.

03:33:36.540 --> 03:33:39.620
I'm not going to try to get you into Skylanders.

03:33:39.620 --> 03:33:40.740
I promise. All right.

03:33:40.740 --> 03:33:43.780
I don't want to be into Skylanders. All right.

03:33:44.620 --> 03:33:47.580
You know what I was really going to say is and something

03:33:47.620 --> 03:33:49.420
I think we talked about before

03:33:49.420 --> 03:33:53.060
is that when I was doing my own, like, what games did I love this year?

03:33:53.300 --> 03:33:56.100
My top five, four of them were Vita games,

03:33:56.380 --> 03:33:58.820
which seemed a little ridiculous to me.

03:33:58.820 --> 03:34:01.100
So just because the system kind of sucks

03:34:01.460 --> 03:34:04.100
doesn't mean that the games are awful, too.

03:34:04.620 --> 03:34:07.620
Let me guess that must be luminous persona.

03:34:07.940 --> 03:34:09.780
Mm hmm. Gravity Rush.

03:34:09.780 --> 03:34:11.780
Nope. What else? I didn't beat the game yet.

03:34:11.780 --> 03:34:13.900
So sound shapes.

03:34:13.900 --> 03:34:15.780
Oh, yes. Sound shapes really good.

03:34:15.780 --> 03:34:19.580
And what? Um, and D.J. Maxx. Oh, OK.

03:34:20.460 --> 03:34:21.420
Yeah, I guess that's true.

03:34:21.420 --> 03:34:23.380
Those are all still really great games.

03:34:23.380 --> 03:34:26.540
Yeah. And PlayStation Plus makes it easier because I got four games

03:34:26.540 --> 03:34:29.540
from PlayStation Plus now on there, too, that I can play and love.

03:34:29.620 --> 03:34:32.100
This is the part of the year where all the websites

03:34:32.100 --> 03:34:33.900
are doing their best and worst to 2012.

03:34:33.900 --> 03:34:36.500
And like Yahoo, I don't know why I read Yahoo, but I do.

03:34:36.820 --> 03:34:39.540
They have their worst of 2012 in tech.

03:34:39.540 --> 03:34:41.340
And the Vita inevitably made the list.

03:34:41.340 --> 03:34:43.980
And there's a lot of websites where the Vita made the worst in tech list.

03:34:43.980 --> 03:34:46.580
But yet, yet we have the golden rule of gaming.

03:34:46.580 --> 03:34:48.380
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

03:34:48.380 --> 03:34:51.100
If the games are so good on the Vita, why is the Vita flopping?

03:34:52.420 --> 03:34:53.820
The price sucks.

03:34:53.820 --> 03:35:00.060
And as you know, Flacco Jones says the the first party games

03:35:00.060 --> 03:35:03.580
that should be made by their actual devs are not.

03:35:03.580 --> 03:35:06.060
And so they're not as good with the exceptional big planet.

03:35:06.060 --> 03:35:07.900
I think that game is fun on Vita.

03:35:07.900 --> 03:35:09.060
I really like it on Vita.

03:35:09.060 --> 03:35:10.380
Yeah, a little bit of Vita.

03:35:10.380 --> 03:35:13.500
But God, I'm tired from that, isn't it?

03:35:13.900 --> 03:35:15.900
They were still involved in some capacity.

03:35:15.900 --> 03:35:17.460
And I think that was important.

03:35:17.460 --> 03:35:21.260
Uncharted feels like a bad cell phone knockoff of Uncharted.

03:35:21.380 --> 03:35:22.500
Yeah, it's terrible.

03:35:22.500 --> 03:35:26.140
Yeah, that was a big that was almost on my disappointing list,

03:35:26.140 --> 03:35:28.460
but I didn't really play enough of it to really say that.

03:35:28.460 --> 03:35:30.660
You don't need to just play like five minutes

03:35:30.660 --> 03:35:35.220
and then try to do one of the stupid rubbings or aiming in that game

03:35:35.500 --> 03:35:37.060
or climbing with the touch screen.

03:35:37.060 --> 03:35:38.060
That's terrible, too.

03:35:38.060 --> 03:35:39.500
We were talking about this earlier.

03:35:39.500 --> 03:35:42.780
What would you say was your most disappointing of 2012?

03:35:43.980 --> 03:35:45.740
My game's Guild Wars, too.

03:35:45.740 --> 03:35:48.340
I just it was not as good as I was expecting

03:35:48.340 --> 03:35:51.300
with all the time and effort they put into it.

03:35:52.540 --> 03:35:54.860
I would even throw in Mr. Pandaria.

03:35:55.300 --> 03:35:58.980
I have way too many issues with this game, this expansion.

03:36:00.100 --> 03:36:03.380
I will also say, oh, God, what else did I tell you?

03:36:03.420 --> 03:36:05.460
I told you uncharted because I thought that was really bad.

03:36:05.460 --> 03:36:07.380
Both uncharted, uncharted three.

03:36:07.380 --> 03:36:09.140
Or was that last year?

03:36:09.140 --> 03:36:10.380
I don't know. It wasn't good either.

03:36:10.380 --> 03:36:11.740
Uncharted three was last year.

03:36:11.740 --> 03:36:15.620
OK, well, it's terribleness bled over into this year, too.

03:36:16.940 --> 03:36:19.820
And you know what?

03:36:19.820 --> 03:36:23.020
And this is going to be terrible coming from me,

03:36:23.020 --> 03:36:27.300
but I'm slightly disappointed with the latest Pokemon game

03:36:27.300 --> 03:36:28.540
because it didn't hold my interest.

03:36:28.540 --> 03:36:30.740
I haven't even beaten it yet.

03:36:30.740 --> 03:36:32.180
Wow. Pokemon.

03:36:32.180 --> 03:36:34.580
I kind of can't believe that you would say that.

03:36:34.580 --> 03:36:39.340
I know I only have five badges and there are like too many other games

03:36:39.380 --> 03:36:44.020
I'd rather play than Pokemon right now, which is very depressing to me.

03:36:44.260 --> 03:36:46.980
Somebody put Pokemon White 2 as their game of the year.

03:36:48.020 --> 03:36:50.500
Well, that's their wrong opinion.

03:36:50.500 --> 03:36:53.980
That's cool. How did I know you were going to say something like that?

03:36:54.340 --> 03:36:55.620
All right. Because I'm a jerk.

03:36:55.620 --> 03:36:57.380
Well, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

03:36:58.100 --> 03:37:01.980
Um, no, I don't think so.

03:37:01.980 --> 03:37:03.020
I was trying to think of another funny

03:37:03.020 --> 03:37:06.140
Konami story before I got off the Skype.

03:37:06.140 --> 03:37:10.980
But I oh, one of the times where we went drinking at lunch,

03:37:11.620 --> 03:37:14.380
somebody in the room I sat in,

03:37:15.500 --> 03:37:16.780
they drank too much.

03:37:16.780 --> 03:37:18.940
So they got sent home early.

03:37:18.940 --> 03:37:22.300
And then as a sign of solidarity, I left early, too.

03:37:23.460 --> 03:37:25.460
As a sign of solidarity.

03:37:25.460 --> 03:37:29.300
It also was on a Friday, so it wasn't that bad of an idea.

03:37:29.820 --> 03:37:31.860
All right. All right.

03:37:31.860 --> 03:37:33.420
That's it. I'm going to let you go.

03:37:33.420 --> 03:37:36.340
You can tell more stories when you come to California and guest on the show again.

03:37:36.860 --> 03:37:39.420
OK. All right. Bye bye.

03:37:39.420 --> 03:37:40.580
We can probably fit in one more call.

03:37:40.580 --> 03:37:43.980
One eight seven seven game or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

03:37:43.980 --> 03:37:45.260
Were you doing with last minute stories?

03:37:45.260 --> 03:37:47.340
Loki, are you good?

03:37:47.340 --> 03:37:49.140
I'm good. All right.

03:37:49.140 --> 03:37:51.860
Reading some of the tweets at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.

03:37:52.500 --> 03:37:53.140
SGA 100.

03:37:53.140 --> 03:37:55.060
Matt tweeted us saying I won't be listening tonight

03:37:55.060 --> 03:37:57.180
because I will be seeing The Hobbit for my birthday.

03:37:57.300 --> 03:37:58.220
Happy birthday, by the way.

03:37:58.220 --> 03:38:00.380
Well, and I'm kidding.

03:38:00.380 --> 03:38:01.380
But I will be birthday.

03:38:01.420 --> 03:38:03.500
I hope you like 10 minutes of dwarves singing.

03:38:03.500 --> 03:38:04.740
No, I'm just kidding. I haven't seen it yet.

03:38:04.740 --> 03:38:05.860
I'm not going to hate.

03:38:05.860 --> 03:38:07.900
But I would like to wish you all a happy new year.

03:38:07.900 --> 03:38:09.620
Well, happy new year to you, too.

03:38:09.620 --> 03:38:12.340
And happy birthday. Let's see.

03:38:13.860 --> 03:38:17.820
Act Def tweeted us wanting us to know that Austin Wintory of the Journey

03:38:17.820 --> 03:38:22.580
soundtrack fame released all his music on Bandcamp for Pay What You Want.

03:38:23.020 --> 03:38:25.500
Austin Wintory dot Bandcamp dot com.

03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:29.740
That's pretty awesome and great soundtrack for Journey, by the way.

03:38:30.140 --> 03:38:32.980
Oh, also, I did want to say there is another game that is up

03:38:32.980 --> 03:38:37.580
on the top of my list is Street Fighter across Mega Man.

03:38:38.180 --> 03:38:39.580
Oh, yeah, the the fan one.

03:38:39.580 --> 03:38:41.220
But the music. Mm hmm.

03:38:41.220 --> 03:38:44.020
You can also get the soundtrack as a pay what you want. Nice.

03:38:44.020 --> 03:38:45.820
And I have the whole thing

03:38:45.820 --> 03:38:48.660
burned it off for my husband and put it in his stocking. Very cool.

03:38:48.700 --> 03:38:50.900
All right. Well, let's go to the phones.

03:38:50.900 --> 03:38:52.940
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:38:52.940 --> 03:38:54.140
It's the one and only Rama.

03:38:54.140 --> 03:38:56.700
Hey, Rama. Rama, I was thinking of you.

03:38:57.380 --> 03:38:59.180
Oh, I was thinking of you, too.

03:38:59.180 --> 03:39:02.060
Because we need to, like, get online and watch Dirty Pair.

03:39:04.220 --> 03:39:07.020
That, too. Do you know how much frickin' anime I have sitting on my shelf

03:39:07.020 --> 03:39:08.860
I've bought over the years and get to watch?

03:39:11.060 --> 03:39:13.420
I just finished the first season of Sailor Moon.

03:39:13.420 --> 03:39:14.780
What does that tell you?

03:39:14.780 --> 03:39:18.420
Really? I've watched like the whole run of it three times now.

03:39:19.580 --> 03:39:22.700
In Japanese. Just imagine how many people are going to be watching it

03:39:22.700 --> 03:39:24.820
right before the premiere of new series.

03:39:24.820 --> 03:39:27.500
I need to be on anime jam session, dude.

03:39:27.500 --> 03:39:28.780
It's going to happen.

03:39:28.780 --> 03:39:32.460
Episode 100 is coming soon, and we got some shit in store, you know?

03:39:32.540 --> 03:39:35.500
Nice. Mm hmm. Very cool.

03:39:35.500 --> 03:39:37.580
Well, what to what do we owe this phone call tonight?

03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:41.660
Oh, the whole Shame Stop debacle.

03:39:41.660 --> 03:39:43.660
Oh, you talk about the porn thing?

03:39:44.940 --> 03:39:48.700
I'm sorry. I have to laugh when Shame Stop says they have

03:39:49.020 --> 03:39:52.980
standards and practices on their refurbished machine consoles.

03:39:53.180 --> 03:39:55.940
I'm sorry. How can you call it refurbished

03:39:55.980 --> 03:39:59.660
when I walk in and sell it and 10 minutes later,

03:39:59.700 --> 03:40:01.940
someone comes in and buys what I just sold you.

03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:04.540
That's not refurbished.

03:40:04.540 --> 03:40:08.100
Standards and practices is the firing department, let's be real.

03:40:09.580 --> 03:40:10.620
Standards and practices.

03:40:10.620 --> 03:40:12.100
Q and reset the whole nine yards.

03:40:12.100 --> 03:40:14.140
I mean, they don't really care.

03:40:14.140 --> 03:40:17.460
I mean, I sold them ideas fat with a broken L button.

03:40:17.460 --> 03:40:19.380
They didn't give it to him.

03:40:20.940 --> 03:40:23.340
I should have sold them my broken iPhone,

03:40:23.340 --> 03:40:26.540
but I ended up giving that to my dad because he'll try to fix it knowing him.

03:40:27.420 --> 03:40:29.340
All they're going to do is turn it on.

03:40:29.340 --> 03:40:31.860
See the power's up. That's it. Done.

03:40:33.300 --> 03:40:35.580
Wow. Easy enough.

03:40:36.500 --> 03:40:38.980
Exactly. And this is why I do not.

03:40:39.220 --> 03:40:41.580
I try not to shop there unless I truly had to.

03:40:41.860 --> 03:40:45.140
Last time I went there, I bought NCIS for my 3DS.

03:40:45.260 --> 03:40:47.420
Come to find out if I waited an extra day,

03:40:47.420 --> 03:40:49.660
I could have gotten it from Nintendo World for the same price.

03:40:50.660 --> 03:40:53.740
Yikes. What's been your favorite in gaming this year?

03:40:54.500 --> 03:40:57.540
Well, like I said, it was Final Fantasy Theater rhythm,

03:40:57.700 --> 03:41:00.660
but it was a toss up between that and Mario Kart 7,

03:41:00.660 --> 03:41:02.780
because, you know, I love my Mario Kart.

03:41:02.780 --> 03:41:04.580
Mario Kart's good times.

03:41:04.580 --> 03:41:07.100
Yes, especially when we were playing during the breaks.

03:41:07.300 --> 03:41:09.060
You have to bring that back.

03:41:09.060 --> 03:41:10.780
Especially on it.

03:41:10.780 --> 03:41:12.340
I almost said it on a jam session.

03:41:12.340 --> 03:41:14.540
You probably play it on there, too, but to automate conventions.

03:41:14.740 --> 03:41:18.900
I'm sure there's lots of breakouts of various DS titles and so forth.

03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:23.220
Yeah, I mostly see it Mario Kart or Tetris.

03:41:23.620 --> 03:41:25.700
Right now, the big thing is Pokemon.

03:41:25.700 --> 03:41:27.460
That's what everyone is doing.

03:41:27.460 --> 03:41:28.740
So very cool.

03:41:29.740 --> 03:41:31.300
What about disappointing games this year?

03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:33.140
Is there anything you want to call out as disappointing?

03:41:33.940 --> 03:41:37.940
Oh, well, I didn't play a lot of games this year,

03:41:37.940 --> 03:41:41.220
but I don't think there was anything disappointing.

03:41:41.220 --> 03:41:46.140
But if I have to, I have to join the bandwagon and say Assassin's Creed 3.

03:41:47.420 --> 03:41:47.940
Why that?

03:41:47.940 --> 03:41:50.540
Because there were some people that said Assassin's Creed 3 was the best.

03:41:50.820 --> 03:41:52.620
So why do you put it as most disappointing?

03:41:53.420 --> 03:41:58.260
From my understanding, not just ending, but the gameplay mechanics.

03:41:58.260 --> 03:41:59.660
Some people say it was really horrible.

03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:01.100
Gotcha.

03:42:02.500 --> 03:42:04.940
All right, well, we're going to let you go.

03:42:04.940 --> 03:42:07.180
But good luck with your show in 2013.

03:42:07.180 --> 03:42:08.300
Good luck with Anime Jam Session.

03:42:08.300 --> 03:42:09.620
I look forward to episode 100.

03:42:09.620 --> 03:42:14.700
And when you guys inevitably go live at some point, right?

03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:19.260
That's, well, I might as well say, well, that's part of what we're working on for 100

03:42:19.260 --> 03:42:23.420
because of all the extra equipment I've been buying over the last couple of weeks to get things going.

03:42:23.660 --> 03:42:24.300
Nice.

03:42:24.300 --> 03:42:26.300
So it sounds like we'll be chatting in the coming weeks.

03:42:26.820 --> 03:42:28.060
Oh, you got that right.

03:42:28.060 --> 03:42:28.780
All righty.

03:42:28.940 --> 03:42:29.260
All right.

03:42:29.260 --> 03:42:29.820
Take care, buddy.

03:42:29.820 --> 03:42:31.380
Have a good, have a safe new year.

03:42:31.980 --> 03:42:32.540
You too.

03:42:32.540 --> 03:42:33.820
And stay fabulous.

03:42:33.820 --> 03:42:34.700
And don't get too drunk.

03:42:34.700 --> 03:42:35.260
I will.

03:42:35.260 --> 03:42:35.980
Stay black.

03:42:36.980 --> 03:42:37.740
You got that right.

03:42:37.740 --> 03:42:38.100
All right.

03:42:38.740 --> 03:42:39.260
Bye, buddy.

03:42:39.660 --> 03:42:40.260
Bye.

03:42:40.660 --> 03:42:41.300
All right.

03:42:41.300 --> 03:42:41.820
All right.

03:43:11.300 --> 03:43:15.220
An interview with the producer Brad Foxhoven, former producer in IGN.

03:43:15.700 --> 03:43:18.740
Nintendo surprisingly gave its blessing to the project.

03:43:19.140 --> 03:43:22.940
But, you know, because obviously they didn't like Super Mario Brothers at first.

03:43:22.940 --> 03:43:24.580
But they thought with John Woo it would be better.

03:43:24.900 --> 03:43:27.620
But I guess they couldn't do it.

03:43:27.620 --> 03:43:32.140
And a lot of it had to do with Samus' backstory that they wanted to explore, making a movie about her.

03:43:32.140 --> 03:43:37.860
But Nintendo, I guess, wanted to be the ones to answer those questions, not have it answered in a movie.

03:43:38.540 --> 03:43:39.660
Let's go to one more call.

03:43:39.660 --> 03:43:41.420
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:43:41.420 --> 03:43:42.060
Who's this?

03:43:42.580 --> 03:43:43.220
Hey, what's up?

03:43:43.220 --> 03:43:43.940
It's Tiger Claw.

03:43:43.940 --> 03:43:45.100
Hey, Tiger Claw.

03:43:45.100 --> 03:43:46.500
And it's video.

03:43:46.500 --> 03:43:51.020
Just like, remember I said, I remember I said a couple of weeks ago that I wanted to get more video calls.

03:43:51.180 --> 03:43:54.140
And we even have the cam, which we need to get on the show.

03:43:54.140 --> 03:43:55.460
But maybe in 2013.

03:43:55.460 --> 03:43:57.580
Well, how you do, Tiger Claw?

03:43:58.140 --> 03:43:59.580
Oh, I'm doing fine.

03:44:00.060 --> 03:44:07.580
Earlier in the show, you guys mentioned about the VOG Network Leaderboard and stuff and how I'm still in the top on there.

03:44:07.620 --> 03:44:08.380
That's right.

03:44:08.780 --> 03:44:12.140
He's number one for the year, if you look at like overall score, I believe.

03:44:12.140 --> 03:44:12.980
Is he really?

03:44:12.980 --> 03:44:14.260
I think so.

03:44:14.260 --> 03:44:17.060
I worry on Bobby Black Wolf telling me all that stuff.

03:44:17.060 --> 03:44:19.620
But no, I wanted you to call in and talk some shit.

03:44:19.620 --> 03:44:20.460
And here you are.

03:44:20.460 --> 03:44:21.380
This is great.

03:44:21.540 --> 03:44:24.020
So are you here to trash talk Flaco Jones a little bit?

03:44:24.820 --> 03:44:29.180
I just want to know is how has he managed to get first place?

03:44:29.180 --> 03:44:32.780
Because I don't know where he's getting all those extra points.

03:44:32.940 --> 03:44:37.580
He's doing it because he gets a lot of people somehow to reply to his comments.

03:44:38.380 --> 03:44:39.820
I do a lot of comments.

03:44:39.820 --> 03:44:41.020
He does so many comments.

03:44:41.020 --> 03:44:42.860
He gets people to like him and reply to him.

03:44:42.860 --> 03:44:44.020
And I think that's how he's doing it.

03:44:44.140 --> 03:44:44.980
That's how I do it.

03:44:45.980 --> 03:44:56.300
But he may have to change up his strategy in 2013 because there is going to be some not so much changes, but just, you know, we've been promising we're going to change up the game a little bit.

03:44:56.460 --> 03:45:00.100
And so the game will be evolving in 2013.

03:45:00.300 --> 03:45:02.500
So the game has changed.

03:45:02.500 --> 03:45:03.060
That's right.

03:45:03.060 --> 03:45:04.340
The game has changed.

03:45:05.340 --> 03:45:07.340
It sure it definitely did.

03:45:08.900 --> 03:45:21.460
But anyways, for anyone out there that wants to try to get their hands at the leaderboard, all you have to do is one simple thing is to basically go to the website every single day.

03:45:21.660 --> 03:45:22.300
That is all.

03:45:23.180 --> 03:45:25.140
Check in all the check in all the shows.

03:45:25.900 --> 03:45:36.620
Check in all the shows every day, because there will be a day where you'll get a you'll get a loot for actually visiting the site every day.

03:45:37.220 --> 03:45:40.700
Don't go giving away all the game secret and all that stuff.

03:45:40.980 --> 03:45:43.460
And it's a good thing you're revamping the game.

03:45:43.980 --> 03:45:44.500
It's a good thing.

03:45:44.500 --> 03:45:45.860
The game's shifting a little bit.

03:45:45.980 --> 03:45:47.780
We've already said all the strategies tonight.

03:45:48.500 --> 03:45:48.700
Yeah.

03:45:48.700 --> 03:45:51.500
And also, please like people's comments.

03:45:51.500 --> 03:46:05.660
And here's another thing is if someone writes a comment saying that it was a good show, whatever you should like it, there's something positive about your show.

03:46:06.300 --> 03:46:10.860
I think it deserves a like, I think.

03:46:10.860 --> 03:46:15.540
I think any replies with lots of good substance are worthy of a like comment.

03:46:15.540 --> 03:46:16.780
I like and reply.

03:46:16.780 --> 03:46:17.820
Tyler Claus last.

03:46:17.820 --> 03:46:18.820
That was a really good show.

03:46:19.420 --> 03:46:23.900
I like this call that won't get you anything, but it might in 2013.

03:46:23.900 --> 03:46:24.740
So stay tuned.

03:46:25.500 --> 03:46:26.740
New ways to play.

03:46:28.020 --> 03:46:35.180
And hopefully in the future, which I know you guys are planning, maybe you'll get loot for posting in forums or something like that.

03:46:35.180 --> 03:46:36.780
I could you never know.

03:46:36.780 --> 03:46:40.180
We don't want to encourage post touring, but we do want to encourage participation.

03:46:40.180 --> 03:46:41.860
So there's a you never know.

03:46:41.860 --> 03:46:42.980
You never know what might happen with that.

03:46:43.140 --> 03:46:49.980
But since you kind of brought up the whole vog thing and all that I did at some point since it is the last live show of the year and so forth.

03:46:50.260 --> 03:46:56.180
There were a lot of changes this year, obviously, that, you know, they could have gone many different ways.

03:46:56.180 --> 03:47:03.380
And you guys really kind of embraced this whole vog idea, which in many ways was fucking insane to be doing.

03:47:03.460 --> 03:47:05.340
But so many of you guys have just embraced it.

03:47:05.340 --> 03:47:09.740
And like you and Flaco both just kind of, you know, running with the game.

03:47:09.740 --> 03:47:15.700
And not just you guys, you know, like Act Deaf, Immortal King, all those guys you see, they're just hopping the leaderboards and everybody has been participating.

03:47:16.220 --> 03:47:18.340
It's just been so fun.

03:47:18.340 --> 03:47:21.180
And we can't wait to just kind of like continue on that for 2013.

03:47:21.180 --> 03:47:27.380
And I really want to thank everybody that's kind of jumped on board with vog in the hosting community as well.

03:47:27.580 --> 03:47:33.340
Brad from Pod Culture, John from Critical Myth, Brian from British Invaders, Travis and Jess from Understation Live.

03:47:34.340 --> 03:47:39.780
Rama from Anime Jam Session, Syl from Girls Gone Wow, myself twice.

03:47:39.780 --> 03:47:44.380
But I really want to thank just everybody who's really jumped on board with all the other shows.

03:47:44.380 --> 03:47:46.700
And we're hoping to expand the lineup even more in 2013.

03:47:46.700 --> 03:47:48.540
And just everybody has been really excited about this.

03:47:48.540 --> 03:47:49.540
We want to do more video.

03:47:49.900 --> 03:47:51.620
There's so much more we want to do.

03:47:51.620 --> 03:47:55.740
And we're just hoping we can get the resources to do it.

03:47:55.740 --> 03:48:00.460
Speaking of the live video stuff, you've been recently broadcasting some live gameplay.

03:48:00.900 --> 03:48:01.420
That's the thing.

03:48:01.420 --> 03:48:02.460
It's a new thing we want to do.

03:48:02.500 --> 03:48:04.580
It's a great way to promote and so forth.

03:48:04.580 --> 03:48:04.820
Yeah.

03:48:05.380 --> 03:48:08.620
And if I remember, Rob, didn't you get XCOM?

03:48:08.620 --> 03:48:10.540
I don't know if you got it for PC or something.

03:48:11.020 --> 03:48:13.660
I did play it on PlayStation 3.

03:48:13.660 --> 03:48:15.940
I played it the week we didn't have a show.

03:48:16.740 --> 03:48:21.580
I didn't play really a lot of it because I kind of decided it was something I wasn't like super into.

03:48:21.580 --> 03:48:23.740
I'm just I'm so bad at tactical games.

03:48:24.180 --> 03:48:24.780
I don't know.

03:48:24.780 --> 03:48:27.660
I just also just kind of made me want the old ones again.

03:48:27.660 --> 03:48:29.380
I was like, I don't want all this newfangled stuff.

03:48:29.380 --> 03:48:30.700
Just give me the old XCOM game.

03:48:31.020 --> 03:48:39.940
Next time you play it, you should name all the soldiers after people, you know, and then at some point when they die, you start feeling bad about it.

03:48:40.100 --> 03:48:40.780
Dark soccer.

03:48:40.780 --> 03:48:42.700
I just got shot in the face by an alien.

03:48:42.700 --> 03:48:43.420
What am I going to do?

03:48:43.420 --> 03:48:43.900
What am I going to do?

03:48:43.900 --> 03:48:44.860
Die of dysentery.

03:48:46.420 --> 03:48:49.220
It is kind of the new version of somebody dying of dysentery.

03:48:49.340 --> 03:48:50.380
I'm getting a look.

03:48:50.380 --> 03:48:52.020
This is this is why it's too bad.

03:48:52.020 --> 03:48:53.420
We don't have the video yet, but soon.

03:48:53.780 --> 03:48:55.140
Hey, two words.

03:48:55.140 --> 03:48:55.500
What?

03:48:55.540 --> 03:48:56.500
Bite me.

03:48:56.540 --> 03:48:56.940
All right.

03:48:57.500 --> 03:49:00.380
Tigerclaw, I should probably let you go so we can wrap up everything.

03:49:00.380 --> 03:49:03.340
But I do want to thank you for your support with VoG and everything this year.

03:49:03.340 --> 03:49:05.700
And do you have anything else you want to get out before we wrap up the show?

03:49:06.260 --> 03:49:09.140
Well, I would like to wish you all a happy new year.

03:49:09.300 --> 03:49:09.940
Same to you.

03:49:09.940 --> 03:49:15.300
And just hoping for bigger and better things for VoG network in 2013.

03:49:15.540 --> 03:49:16.540
It's already awesome.

03:49:16.900 --> 03:49:17.740
No, yes, of course.

03:49:17.740 --> 03:49:19.700
Bigger, bigger and better is always good.

03:49:19.700 --> 03:49:20.460
Yes, we are.

03:49:20.460 --> 03:49:22.260
We were striving for more in 2013.

03:49:23.380 --> 03:49:24.340
All right, guys.

03:49:24.340 --> 03:49:26.580
So I guess I'll see you later.

03:49:26.620 --> 03:49:27.220
All right.

03:49:27.220 --> 03:49:28.060
Take care, buddy.

03:49:28.060 --> 03:49:29.580
Have a good have a safe new year.

03:49:30.180 --> 03:49:30.540
All right.

03:49:30.540 --> 03:49:31.100
You too.

03:49:31.140 --> 03:49:31.460
All right.

03:49:31.460 --> 03:49:31.900
Bye bye.

03:49:32.540 --> 03:49:32.860
Bye.

03:49:33.820 --> 03:49:36.300
That's a great way to close out the show, I think tonight.

03:49:36.300 --> 03:49:37.780
Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

03:49:37.780 --> 03:49:39.340
I do see the Skypline still lighting up.

03:49:39.340 --> 03:49:40.700
Please consider sending an email.

03:49:41.100 --> 03:49:43.100
Give Dark Sakura tons of shit to read next week.

03:49:43.620 --> 03:49:47.020
Mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com.

03:49:47.180 --> 03:49:48.820
He's killing you and then making you work.

03:49:48.860 --> 03:49:51.980
Before I know first I got an alien to shoot you in the face.

03:49:51.980 --> 03:49:54.140
All right, Rob, you're being a hoe bag.

03:49:54.140 --> 03:49:55.100
I am being a hoe bag.

03:49:55.100 --> 03:49:55.540
All right.

03:49:55.740 --> 03:49:58.860
Before we wrap up the show, we have to reveal who won this list.

03:49:59.580 --> 03:50:05.580
All right, here it is.

03:50:05.580 --> 03:50:09.420
The top four as voted on you, the listeners.

03:50:09.620 --> 03:50:12.940
This is a crazy situation, but we have a top four tonight because

03:50:12.940 --> 03:50:15.900
we have a three way tie for second place.

03:50:16.540 --> 03:50:17.380
So here it is.

03:50:17.580 --> 03:50:20.660
The three answers you voted in second place tonight.

03:50:21.260 --> 03:50:23.820
Final Fantasy 11 goes free to play.

03:50:24.660 --> 03:50:26.740
Lots of fans of free stuff.

03:50:27.580 --> 03:50:31.420
Uh, a Vita price drop before the one year anniversary.

03:50:32.300 --> 03:50:33.740
Again, fans of cheap things.

03:50:33.780 --> 03:50:34.060
All right.

03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:34.420
What happened?

03:50:34.540 --> 03:50:37.140
And, uh, I don't know what this says about cheap, but also

03:50:37.140 --> 03:50:38.540
tying for second place tonight.

03:50:38.860 --> 03:50:44.340
The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with a commitment and the platinum live program.

03:50:44.940 --> 03:50:45.580
So there it is.

03:50:45.580 --> 03:50:50.820
They're all money related things, but the number one answer for 2013

03:50:50.820 --> 03:50:55.020
predictions as voted by you, the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:50:55.700 --> 03:50:57.180
No PlayStation four.

03:50:57.860 --> 03:50:58.700
There it is.

03:51:00.300 --> 03:51:01.060
It is done.

03:51:01.060 --> 03:51:02.700
Sign it, seal it, deliver it.

03:51:02.700 --> 03:51:05.300
Tell Sony, wait and make it better.

03:51:06.220 --> 03:51:07.180
Don't rush it.

03:51:07.260 --> 03:51:08.100
Don't pull a Vita.

03:51:08.100 --> 03:51:08.980
Don't pull a Vita.

03:51:10.460 --> 03:51:11.020
All right.

03:51:11.500 --> 03:51:15.500
Games, games, game developers, developers, developers.

03:51:15.500 --> 03:51:15.900
Wait a minute.

03:51:15.900 --> 03:51:16.300
Wrong show.

03:51:16.300 --> 03:51:16.660
Sorry.

03:51:17.100 --> 03:51:17.540
All right.

03:51:17.900 --> 03:51:20.580
That is really going to wrap it up for us tonight.

03:51:20.660 --> 03:51:23.620
Um, but not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:51:23.940 --> 03:51:26.460
Uh, I want to thank Alan for being on the show tonight.

03:51:26.460 --> 03:51:27.380
He's in the other room.

03:51:27.380 --> 03:51:31.060
If he runs in here by chance, I'll let him say something, but Flaco, I'm

03:51:31.060 --> 03:51:34.180
so happy you made it through a full show and not just that, but probably

03:51:34.980 --> 03:51:36.660
might be our longest show of the year.

03:51:36.660 --> 03:51:37.340
I know, right?

03:51:37.340 --> 03:51:39.460
Well, we had to make up for not being here last week, but thank you.

03:51:39.460 --> 03:51:41.940
I know you have to stay up late and you've got kids and you had

03:51:41.940 --> 03:51:42.860
drove an hour to get here.

03:51:42.860 --> 03:51:44.380
So at least I don't have to work tomorrow.

03:51:44.460 --> 03:51:44.900
There you go.

03:51:44.900 --> 03:51:46.900
So seriously, thank you for being here.

03:51:47.260 --> 03:51:49.460
Um, and, uh, come back again when you can.

03:51:50.260 --> 03:51:51.140
I'll try.

03:51:51.140 --> 03:51:51.580
I'll try.

03:51:51.580 --> 03:51:52.340
I love being here.

03:51:52.420 --> 03:51:54.380
And thanks for being so enthusiastic about the network.

03:51:54.380 --> 03:51:55.700
Like for real, like it means a lot.

03:51:55.740 --> 03:51:57.940
Like you, you, I think I live on the website.

03:51:58.740 --> 03:52:00.140
That's what we want people to do.

03:52:00.140 --> 03:52:01.580
So you got to get great talking to everybody.

03:52:01.580 --> 03:52:05.300
I need little Flaco's Flaco clones.

03:52:05.340 --> 03:52:06.820
Actually, we have some other people to do too.

03:52:06.820 --> 03:52:08.100
Obviously we just talked to tiger claw.

03:52:08.100 --> 03:52:09.500
He's, he's pretty good about that too.

03:52:09.500 --> 03:52:13.140
So, um, anyway, in all seriousness, have a great new year.

03:52:13.180 --> 03:52:14.940
Do you have any final thoughts or listeners tonight?

03:52:15.660 --> 03:52:18.980
Uh, watch community when it comes back.

03:52:18.980 --> 03:52:19.980
It's my favorite show.

03:52:20.380 --> 03:52:21.900
Your shirt is great, by the way.

03:52:21.940 --> 03:52:23.100
The eight bit style.

03:52:23.100 --> 03:52:25.740
I know that it's, it's from their web.

03:52:25.780 --> 03:52:29.020
That's from the, the NBC website because it's a, it's an episode of

03:52:29.020 --> 03:52:30.780
community, they're all in an eight bit game.

03:52:31.020 --> 03:52:33.540
They need the journey to the center of Hawthorne, but they need

03:52:33.540 --> 03:52:35.300
to just shop Chevy chase out.

03:52:35.340 --> 03:52:37.940
Well, he already left the show, so that's the best thing.

03:52:37.940 --> 03:52:38.620
Watch this season.

03:52:38.620 --> 03:52:40.820
Cause you realize at the end, he's going to leave the show.

03:52:41.540 --> 03:52:42.940
The worst part of the show is going to be gone.

03:52:42.940 --> 03:52:43.180
Of course.

03:52:43.180 --> 03:52:45.620
It's probably going to cancel too, but all right.

03:52:45.940 --> 03:52:47.620
It's the last season's running by the way.

03:52:48.540 --> 03:52:50.900
Oh, it wasn't planned last season.

03:52:50.900 --> 03:52:54.980
No, it was this, the office and parks and rec, I think are the last season.

03:52:55.140 --> 03:52:55.860
No, not yet.

03:52:55.860 --> 03:52:59.380
So I've been official, it's over, but it's not official.

03:53:00.420 --> 03:53:00.700
Yeah.

03:53:00.700 --> 03:53:03.140
30 rock is the one that's on his last season, but yeah, they're, they're

03:53:03.140 --> 03:53:05.980
running, they're going to run their Christmas show in like March or

03:53:05.980 --> 03:53:06.260
something.

03:53:06.260 --> 03:53:08.260
It's, it's going to be bad, but I still love it.

03:53:08.780 --> 03:53:13.540
Uh, why is the civic vampire saying yay, community Annie's boobs, Annie's

03:53:13.540 --> 03:53:15.580
boobs, hashtag, hashtag Annie's boobs.

03:53:15.580 --> 03:53:18.220
I thought he was talking about your wife and I was going to be a little

03:53:18.220 --> 03:53:19.740
defensive for you because you left chat.

03:53:19.740 --> 03:53:22.780
Annie's boobs is the name of a monkey on community.

03:53:22.780 --> 03:53:24.140
Don't talk about his wife's boobs like that.

03:53:24.140 --> 03:53:24.500
All right.

03:53:25.140 --> 03:53:26.460
Anyhow, got to watch the show.

03:53:26.460 --> 03:53:27.140
Got to watch the show.

03:53:27.140 --> 03:53:28.180
Boobs are monkeys.

03:53:28.180 --> 03:53:28.540
What?

03:53:29.540 --> 03:53:31.820
You guys are all lost because you need to watch this.

03:53:31.860 --> 03:53:32.860
No, I don't watch lost.

03:53:34.380 --> 03:53:37.100
If Reggie looks like a monkey, then he looks like boobs.

03:53:38.860 --> 03:53:39.780
We're bringing that back.

03:53:41.060 --> 03:53:41.660
Loki.

03:53:41.700 --> 03:53:43.100
Your final thought tonight?

03:53:43.340 --> 03:53:46.260
Uh, my final thought is I'm going to be busy in 2013.

03:53:47.260 --> 03:53:48.220
Busy bebs.

03:53:48.700 --> 03:53:49.380
Dark soccer.

03:53:49.380 --> 03:53:50.260
Your final thought tonight?

03:53:52.620 --> 03:53:53.220
Monkeys.

03:53:54.020 --> 03:53:57.900
My final thought tonight is, um, you know, as I always say, help us

03:53:57.900 --> 03:54:00.740
spread the word about our show, about VOG.

03:54:01.020 --> 03:54:02.220
Word of mouth is all we got.

03:54:02.220 --> 03:54:04.180
So tell a friend about what you heard here.

03:54:04.300 --> 03:54:07.340
Thank you to everybody who has helped make this year a success.

03:54:07.340 --> 03:54:09.700
Thank you to everybody who supported us through big changes.

03:54:09.900 --> 03:54:13.220
Thank you to everybody who's continued to support us, uh, supported other

03:54:13.220 --> 03:54:17.180
projects, supported other indie shows, even if it's like not even a VOG show.

03:54:17.180 --> 03:54:19.900
If it's just like an indie show, thank you for supporting podcasting.

03:54:20.100 --> 03:54:22.140
Cause some people try to say podcasting is dead.

03:54:22.140 --> 03:54:24.620
And to that, I say, hell no.

03:54:25.300 --> 03:54:28.740
As long as there is a microphone and a computer, nobody told me that.

03:54:28.820 --> 03:54:30.100
I know I didn't get the memo.

03:54:30.620 --> 03:54:33.500
So, uh, we'll be back to do it all again next year.

03:54:34.380 --> 03:54:36.220
Episode 500 next year, you guys.

03:54:36.300 --> 03:54:41.660
And maybe this by slim margins, although it's too likely, but

03:54:42.020 --> 03:54:44.740
maybe win the podcast awards.

03:54:44.900 --> 03:54:45.460
Oh yeah.

03:54:45.460 --> 03:54:49.860
That's coming up soon too, but we didn't buy a ticket to the ceremony.

03:54:49.860 --> 03:54:50.980
So I'm probably not going to win.

03:54:52.100 --> 03:54:52.500
All right.

03:54:52.500 --> 03:54:53.620
It's good to be nominated.

03:54:53.660 --> 03:54:53.740
Yeah.

03:54:53.740 --> 03:54:55.540
It's it's, it's great to be nominated.

03:54:55.620 --> 03:54:56.580
It feels really good.

03:54:56.940 --> 03:54:58.140
I'm in it to win it.

03:54:58.740 --> 03:55:03.140
So buying a ticket gets you like how many more podcast award points to get there?

03:55:03.180 --> 03:55:05.380
I'm not going to shade the whole thing.

03:55:05.380 --> 03:55:06.820
It isn't, you know, it is what it is.

03:55:06.820 --> 03:55:07.140
All right.

03:55:07.780 --> 03:55:11.980
I, as long as an indie podcast wins, I will be happy and I'm

03:55:11.980 --> 03:55:12.980
pretty sure one is going to win.

03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:13.580
All right.

03:55:13.580 --> 03:55:14.180
I'm in it to win it.

03:55:14.380 --> 03:55:14.700
All right.

03:55:14.700 --> 03:55:15.140
That's it.

03:55:15.140 --> 03:55:15.540
We're done.
