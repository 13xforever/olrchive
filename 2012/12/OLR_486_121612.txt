December 16, 2012, Wii Homebrew Channel is now running on the Wii U, Microsoft lifts a ban on their Windows Store, and one MMO announces they will end subscription fees.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio live for this, our 486th episode, December the 16th, 2012.
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and so forth with my co-hosts.
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
I am a happy, blissful person right now because I have JoJo's and coffee.
Now, I made you explain this on Bobby Blackwell's show, so you gotta explain it here too.
What exactly are JoJo's, for those that don't know?
They're like Oreos, except they're the Trader Joe's brands.
They actually, I think, taste a little bit better than regular Oreos, but these have like a candy cane filling in them, so they are basically chocolate mint cookies.
Candy canes are great, just saying.
They are, and I put a picture, I think, of the box in the chat room, but I can do it again.
I put one up on our site, but I'll link a picture in the chat room.
Trader Joe's is like the best bachelor shopping store ever.
I'm not just for that audience, obviously, but it's a great place to shop.
Well, I mean, the thing that I like about it is that you can get really healthy, good food for relatively inexpensive.
We actually spend less going to Trader Joe's than we do at the regular grocery store.
Now careful, they're not paying us to endorse them, so we don't want to go too far.
And I will tell you something, if you happen to be someone who eats kosher, it actually is a good place to get kosher meat.
There you go.
And Hanukkah's all over, right?
You partied it away?
Hanukkah ended at nightfall today.
Oh, okay.
Because it's eight days and it started last Saturday.
Right.
I always forget like the sundown thing kind of.
Yeah.
I'm going, this is a way that I tell people how to remember what days are for, you know, Jewish calendar.
In Genesis it says, and the night and the day were the first day.
So night today is the first day.
Don't get all preachy.
I'm just saying that that's why it's translated that way, and that's how it helps me remember that it's at nightfall.
Say hello to Tech Master Loki, who will preach the gospel of hacking here on the show.
No, I don't know.
If I'm going to endorse anything, I'm going to endorse the ultimate breakfast set, Lumberjacks.
The ultimate breakfast is fantastic.
It does live up to its name.
It is.
Two pieces of French toast.
That's the side.
That comes on a separate plate.
The main plate.
This is where the fun happens.
You get your choice of potatoes.
So I got country potatoes with cheese and green onions on it.
A half pound of ham.
Four sausages, four strips of bacon, and eggs.
Welcome to America.
America!
And what's great about the bacon, you know, most places I have to go, hey, can you cook the bacon crispy?
This shit comes out, it's perfect.
It is just like, you can hear the snap of the bacon when you break it.
It's fantastic.
And it's so much food, you can't eat it all at once.
I mean, I eat a lot of food sometimes, but that's like a meal for a few days.
and many more.
And one of these days, because I was looking at it, I thought about bringing it today, but they have this burger that they take, it's basically one of those burgers, like, they will take a picture of you when you order this burger because the burger is huge.
It's like the size of my laptop.
Wow.
Oh, is that the place that, well, did you hear about the pizza burger thing?
Yeah, I've seen that in, like, Japan or China or something like that.
Yeah, but is it, so is it, like, the same thing, like, that big?
Yeah, it's giant.
It's a one-pound burger, and then all the other stuff.
It doesn't just have to be American dishes, though, because there's a faux place that Alan and I like to go to that's just up the street, not that far, because they're open super late, like till 1 a.m., and it's such better late-night food than Denny's, right?
But they do this thing called the Faux King Challenge, where it's like this gigantic... That's that place we went to...
Oh, that's right.
We have to go there on Christmas Eve.
Yeah, we do our little Christmas Day.
Christmas Day.
We have to do it on Christmas Day.
It's fucking great.
Yeah, and I think the place is called, like, the Foe King or something.
No, that's not the name.
You eat your Foe King food.
Yeah, but it's the Foe King Challenge, and it's got, like, this gigantic bowl of foe with, like, two pounds of meat and two pounds of noodles.
Like, it's insane.
Like, we look at all the pictures on the wall of people who've ordered it, and it's like, oh, my gosh.
You know what?
I think I should do the phoking challenge.
I don't think you can.
I think that's like two pounds of pork.
I don't know if you can.
You might have to beg for forgiveness.
You know, since they're bringing up Epic Mealtime in chat, I did watch Epic Chef this week, which is fantastic, by the way.
I mean, that needs to be on the Food Network.
It's kind of a cross between Epic Mealtime and Chopped.
which is great and then you know they present one of the ingredients is a suitcase of bacon because that's just you know the most unusual quantity of bacon ever a suitcase but one of the things about Epic Meal Time is they have a cookbook and the cookbook is actually in the quantities that they make it on the show so it's like okay this dish requires 25 pounds of bacon and you know five pounds of beef and whatever it's fantastic
Speaking of which, my Secret Santa got me four pounds of bacon and that's fantastic.
My Secret Santa is my co-worker and he knows that I love bacon.
Let's see.
Alan Alchemy is in our chat room.
And I always say the fourth guest on our show is you guys live in our chat room.
We do tape live every Sunday night at vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
If you happen to be listening live, participate with us in the chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where Alan Alchemy says it's actually called Faux Bac Viet or something like that.
Yes, thank you for just giving away where we lived to all the listeners because I just said it was right up the street.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Um, but, uh, their food is amazing, seriously.
If you're ever up in this area, go eat their pho.
It's fokin' good!
Horrible, horrible events that happened on Friday and just this unimaginable tragedy that happened in a school in Connecticut.
I can't wrap my fucking mind around how awful what happened is.
It is unexplainable.
The madness behind what happened is truly unexplainable.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Who went on his Facebook and said, dude, it's not me, leave me alone.
Yeah, right?
So, you know, but that didn't stop hordes of people from, because the media had already tried and convicted Ryan Lanza.
They didn't stop people from going on his Facebook, finding all these things he liked because, you know, people want to get inside the killer's mind.
They want to be inside the mind, like what drives this person to madness and to do such terrible, terrible things.
and so, you know, oh, blame the video games.
And so, Ryan had liked a video game that we here at OLR ourselves like, Mass Effect.
And what happens?
The Mass Effect page gets filled up with all this, you've got blood on your hands, you made a game that is responsible for this event happening and da-da-da-da-da and all these really, really
Just jump to conclusions things and just hateful things and I understand that in times of tragedy we want to like wrap our heads around and find a reason like why and how could this happen and how could we prevent it from happening again and all this but that doesn't really excuse mob mentality.
No, it doesn't.
Video games I know and things that have horrific imagery.
Does Mass Effect have some bad stuff?
Yeah, but is it the worst I've ever seen?
Not by any stretch of the imagination.
That ending, the original ending, it drove them to madness.
I actually have to share something with you that someone posted on Tumblr.
Sure, go ahead.
I reposted it on my Mass Effect Tumblr just saying, no one plays Mass Effect and says, whoa, this is violence.
It's really inflaming my inner serial killer.
No, they play Mass Effect and then they cry.
Absolutely.
It's emotion.
You make a lot of decisions about what's the way to react here.
And you can play the third one with no combat.
If you make bad decisions, you will suffer for those decisions.
It's not just kill for no reason like other games like, let's say...
or Postal or whatever.
And I'm not necessarily pointing the finger at those games and saying, these games are the reason that this happened.
Because that's not true either.
But he liked Grand Theft Auto and the funny physics cars, which I happen to love as well.
Are they the falsely accused killer or the real one?
I don't know somebody.
See, the thing is, I don't personally don't really care about what he was thinking.
I don't care.
I don't think that way.
I don't want to think that way.
I don't want to understand that kind of thought.
What I want is for people who have those mental issues to get treatment instead of, you know, hospitals losing their funding and putting crazies back on the street.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Yes, but I mean, there's obviously, you know, what drove him to it and so forth.
There's no easy answer.
This is the problem is that I don't think necessarily we'll ever be able to explain what drives a person to do something like that because the rest of us are rational people and we don't think irrationally like this person did in this scenario.
Like, that's a good thing that we're not capable of getting inside that man's head, right?
Yeah.
We shouldn't be able to know that because that's a dark, dark, dark place.
If I can reference one other thing.
Sure.
There's an article written that's on the Huffington Post that's been floating around about a woman who has a child who has... They don't know what exactly is wrong with him, but it causes him to lie and lash out and do very violent things.
Things that they're saying that he has in common with the gunman.
But they said that they can't do anything for him until he does something that gets him convicted.
There's no public mental health to take care of that kind of thing.
They don't treat them until they've committed a crime.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And if you don't believe me, why don't I play a clip from you from one of the major news networks that a lot of people watch on the day of the shooting.
This is a clip from Fox News.
I want to point out, Ryan was 24 years old.
Adam was 20.
So this was still during that whole time where, yes, the media was perpetuating false information.
But again, we're looking for that reason.
We need to point our finger at something to blame.
I don't think it's coincidental at all.
I think we've got to look at these forces that
Empower people to get some knowledge through the internet and support, but there are a lot of dehumanizing forces that come with that.
Reality TV is no friend of preventing such things.
Facebook is no friend of preventing such things, I have to say.
And I think we're at a time again, and we mentioned this earlier, we've now pushed the red line of the unthinkable into kindergarten classrooms.
So if you're a 20 year old male and you play online games, look out.
And you like Facebook, look out.
It's basically old people just saying, things we don't understand.
They're causing the problems in this world.
Damn that rock music and those comic books and the television and the skateboarding and those things that the children like.
I mean, that's basically what it sounds like to me.
And then we call it Fox News.
Fox News is stupid.
In the same breath, today...
Wake up!
What can we do about it?
I think what we need to do is show the world that there's a lot of rationally thinking professional people that happen to play video games and watch movies responsibly because we're responsible people.
Rob, 20 years, it's going to be something else.
DarkSakura.com
The whole point is that, and I'm really trying not to get political.
I know, you're showing great restraint.
But they need to start looking into the people themselves who do this, not just...
You know, and also, I'm very irritated that they're trying to bring up that this guy had some form of autism, which I know plenty of people who are high-functioning autistic who have zero.
What he did is the act of a sociopath.
Or Asperger's.
Like, how quick were they to try and say that this guy had that?
And I don't know if we really know that or not at this point.
I'm going to tell you when...
DarkSakura.com
for example uh you know there would be how one person would look at this and then say oh the poor parents oh let's blame someone a person with Asperger's would more likely be like what caused this where can we get to the root of the problem how can we make sure this doesn't happen again that's the difference instead of you know and and I know like I said I know plenty of people
But the thing that they need to really look at is that this person had something that went wrong in his head that made him snap.
And look at it too, there's a little bit more in that.
One of the people he killed was his mother.
What was going on between him and his mother?
What was going on at home?
What was the situation that formed this person that led them to that?
Because a person is not just what they play.
A person is a collection of all the experiences that has made them who they are.
Perhaps he had some sort of form of autism.
Perhaps he had some sort of behavioral disorder.
There are times where sociopaths who grow up become very, very good liars.
and they can pretend to be like everybody else.
They can maybe look like they have a disassociative disorder when instead they really don't have that same emotional connect to other people.
They don't feel that way to other people.
They don't care.
And no amount of therapy is ever going to change the brain of a sociopath.
They need to be taken off the streets.
It's a tough situation.
This is a question that's not going to be answered for a long time.
The point and why I wanted to bring this up, however, is that I'm just, I don't, because I'm a gamer and this person who did the unthinkable is, I guess, being paid as a gamer, although we don't even really know if he was or not yet.
I do not appreciate being put in the same bucket as this guy.
Do you?
No.
I'm a professional person with a professional job who's done the same thing for like 11 years and, you know, has run this podcast for 10 years and so forth.
And, you know, I'm a mature when appropriate individual that happens to enjoy video games.
Does that make me a bad person?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But the whole point, don't come at it with an emotional reaction to it.
Come to this with logic and rationality.
Have your facts ready.
You know, talk to the ECA, the Electronic Consumers Association.
The ECA is probably one of the single best resources for information, statistical information, that's going to combat anything that faux news or anybody can throw at you.
And by the way, don't just write off Fox News.
There are people out there who believe everything that comes off of them.
My mother is one of them.
Well, and it's not even, like, almost every news station.
I think NPR was the only one who didn't peg the wrong person in the beginning.
It's not just, like, I just happen to have that clip because I stole it from Game Politics.
Thanks.
But it's not specific to that particular news network.
I mean, no matter where your political leanings are, how you feel about certain stations or what have you, misinformation was everywhere this week, including Facebook, including Twitter and all of that stuff.
So as we try to find a reason for the unthinkable.
Anyhow, I don't mean to stray too far from what is supposed to be a light-hearted escape topic.
We do play video games.
Yes, I am a gamer.
Games are what I play to escape the world for a little bit.
Just like a lot of you guys watch movies or TV shows or roleplay or draw, paint.
Read comics, whatever it is.
A lot of these things are ways to break out of the quote-unquote real world for a little while when all this crazy crap's going on.
And seriously, look at history.
Back in the 1500s, are you familiar with the term called the Bonfire of the Vanities?
I remember the movie.
The bonfire of the vanities were when religious groups were going around saying that the modern stream of art in the early renaissance was responsible for debauchery and, I mean, come on, we're dealing with the de Medici's who were half popes and half killing off their relatives.
You know, who were saying that all of this opulence and grandeur was a result of the artists and the music at the time, so they were going out and burning paintings.
Well, is this much different than, you know, what happened then?
Instead of that, they're looking for another scapegoat and they're banning things and preventing them from being, you know, released.
We had the same thing with the records being played backwards in the 70s and 80s.
I mean, this is history.
Why don't we fucking learn?
John Lennon was a Satanist, totally, remember?
Why don't we just look at our history and finally fucking learn something?
Porkchop in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, soon there'll be t-shirts saying, games don't kill people.
You know, funny enough, the ECA was giving out shirts at E3 or PAX or one of those expos, and it has a picture of the various controllers, and it says, contrary to popular belief, these things do not make me a killer.
Love that shirt.
I have mine.
I need to fix the shoulder.
Love that shirt.
I've repaired that shirt like twice.
K Sarasara in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, I do wonder about the impact on a person who solely plays violent video games for a disproportionate number of hours a day, specifically high consumers with social disorders.
and you know what you said the key word social disorder well and the fact that you know you solely play violent video games for a disproportionate that implies that that person doesn't know when to put the controller down and needs like a teenager a young adult or a child that's where the parents need to step in and watch what their kids are playing and make sure it's not a disproportionate amount you know that's I think where somebody else has to step in and say you know enough turn off the TV
And I know I've brought this up before.
There was an episode of Penn & Teller Bullshit where they took a seven-year-old and then a former, I think he was a former Marine, and the kid loved playing first-person shooters.
He was really good at it, and the Marine was a player too.
Took him out to a firing range and had him shoot off three rounds of a semi-automatic gun.
The kid busted out in tears and said he never wanted to look at a gun again.
That would be me right there.
I don't like guns.
I don't want to touch a gun.
Well, I'll do the carnival.
Or light guns.
Duck Hunt is about as gun as I'm going to get.
I like target shooting.
It doesn't mean that I want to turn it on a person.
I like point blank.
And for example, a friend of mine, more like an acquaintance, was doing an inspection at a home.
And a homeless guy came in and charged her and she shot him.
And she got away and he probably would have attacked her.
But even after that, she was sitting in her car hyperventilating for having wounded somebody.
Having a gun doesn't make you a killer.
Being a killer makes you a killer.
I want to move on and get back into video games.
It was a topic that had to be brought up, though, so thank you guys for sitting through it.
Really appreciate it.
If you have some, you know, put-together thoughts on it, you want to email us, mailbag at orangelantradio.com.
We will take phone calls later in the show if you are brave enough to bring it up live here on the show.
But we do have a lot of video gaming topics we want to get to.
I want to close with you guys, the listeners, with some final comments here in our chat room.
Ksarocera, with another good line here, I think it's like a buffet.
Nobody should only consume one thing all the time.
I think that's a good thought.
This is a great picture.
This is the contrary to popular opinion.
These do not make me a killer.
Well, except maybe the Wiimote.
That shit's dangerous.
It's kind of like the shirt, but yeah.
I'm going to give Immortal King the last word on this because I think this quote's great.
I remember a saying from my teacher.
If we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.
DarkSakura, what video games have you been playing?
I played Mass Effect for eight hours yesterday.
What was that line about nobody should consume one thing all the time?
I was sitting in my pajamas with a headache and not feeling well all day, so I sat back and played all the Mass Effect I wanted, and it was glorious.
Glorious.
And most of it actually wasn't combat, just saying.
I will tell you, though, if I had to consume one thing all the time, it would probably be these JoJo's with the candy cane.
You would be so anemic and just... And fat.
I would be very, very fat.
You would be like, what's that character from Adventure Time, the princess, the glob princess?
Yes.
Loki!
Loki!
Far Cry 3
Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 2
Thanks for watching!
For some reason, like on Wednesday, I noticed when we were playing Black Ops 2 System Link that it says what our NAT settings are in the bottom right-hand corner.
And usually it's strict.
You always would get the, you know, when you log in live or do a network test or something like that, it'd say, you know, your NAT settings are too strict that you may be limited to what games you connect to and that kind of stuff.
But for some reason, it said open.
I was like, wait, that's odd.
Why is it doing that?
Why does it say open?
It's supposed to be strict.
That's really strange.
So I didn't think much of it.
And then the next day, I think we played Black Ops 2 again, and it said open again.
I was like...
That's odd.
I wonder what's going on here.
So I'm like, hey, you want to try playing Grand Theft Auto?
And so we played some Grand Theft Auto.
No disconnects.
We played Grand Theft Auto again later that day.
No disconnects.
I left it on from my morning to lunch for a good three hours.
Nothing disconnected.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What the fuck is going on?
This is unheard of.
So we've been playing Grand Theft Auto.
We're probably going to go back to it now, assuming the network stays the way it is, which I am so excited about that because I missed Grand Theft Auto so much.
So we're going to hopefully be getting into more episodes from Liberty City Deathmatch again because I need to get back up in the rank charts.
I fell down to 120 because...
I haven't played in a while.
So I need to get back up there.
I need to break 60 again.
Ironically, though, we played so much of the non-ranked deathmatch that I'm number five in the world.
So that was kind of fun.
You're number five in the world?
Yeah, but it's a non-ranked deathmatch.
It just means we've played it so much that we've earned so much money that we're number five in the world.
Actually, my coworkers are in the top 20.
Um, but yeah, and ranked deathmatch though on Ballad of Gay Tony, I was up to like in the sixties out of the, you know, 200,000 people playing.
Um, so that's pretty good.
And then, um, what else did I play?
I'll play a little bit more Minecraft.
I've been fixing some of the stuff.
Um, I've been actually trying to go around the just updated spout craft, um, which is a different client you can use.
Um,
Can you shoot the Slenderman?
You can make the Slender Man appear, but you can make those happen.
Although those are part of Flan's mod, which he's supposed to be working on.
He's done with school right now, so now he's going to be updating his mod for 1.45, which should be done by Christmas, he says.
I'm hoping to add that in there.
Plus, that client runs a little bit better.
Thanks for watching!
They have a Core i7 model and what I'm doing is I'm going to actually pop the i5 chip out of it and put an i7 in there that I know it will run.
And also going to double the RAM in there so I have 8 gigs of RAM.
Because that's all I can really update on it.
And also going to reset the heat sink on it because...
it gets really hot and it's just because the thermal paste is crap so i'm gonna put some arctic silver mx4 on there and uh hope for the best because i've done all the cooling mods i can on this thing other than like throwing a bunch of copper inside there and who knows it may end up doing that too so um so that's i think that's all i've played this week um
Yeah, that was it.
Believe it or not, I played some new games this week.
A couple of them.
No.
I know, right?
I did not touch Mass Effect at all this week.
I know, shock and awe, right?
Not even multiplayer on Part 3.
I did play, on the PlayStation Vita, I played DJ Max Technica Tune, right?
A lot of you music game fans have been excited about this one.
It's out on the Vita.
You can download it in the shop.
So I just did the downloaded version because I guess the...
I don't know.
I didn't get on that bandwagon.
I was like, fuck it.
I'll just do the download.
Once I learned about the whole thing where you can back up all the files to the PlayStation 3 or the PC so I don't have to keep downloading them every time, I was like, I'll just download it.
Even though I only have an 8-gig card in there, I'll figure it out.
Um, so yeah, DJ Max Technica Tune.
Um, pretty good use of the Vita because it's a touch game, right?
Very similar to Elite Beat Agents, except there's no stylus.
You kind of use your finger.
Um, the bar goes along the bottom and then it comes back along the top.
So it's kind of like, imagine like a racetrack.
and as the little bar goes around the racetrack you have to touch the little dots in tune with the music but sometimes you drag them sometimes there are multiple taps in the same place even though the bar might still be moving so you have to like you might have to do little taps that are kind of disjointed a little bit so it makes it weird to hold
and then special to this version because it is the PlayStation Vita, they do the backtapping.
Good news about the backtapping, it's not in a specific place.
You just have to tap the back because that would be like impossible because the backtap is really hard sometimes to hold the controller and do it that way but you can just kind of tap anywhere.
So you can do the backtaps in that mode although actually the backtap is only in one particular mode.
There's like an easy mode which I think is the pop mixing and
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and uh the song list you know i haven't really been following the dj max series i didn't really play i mean i saw a few of them on the playstation portable uh i played the arcade version of dj max a couple times like i remember the song flee but that's not in the game uh it's it's more of a new song list
It's a pretty diverse song list, obviously very heavy on the K-pop.
No, there's no Gangnam Style, but since a lot of people are into K-pop right now thanks to that song, and I know a lot of you guys that were music game fans were probably into this style of music before, there's a lot of that style of music here that won't disappoint.
Like five songs from the band Step, who's like this Korean girl pop group.
Very bright, very vibrant, lots of bright background videos, music videos that are very, very bright, especially because this is kind of a girl band and those types of videos tend to be very bright and poppy and happy.
There's lots of visuals in there that kind of can entrance you.
And sometimes the background videos can be a little bit distracting from the notes sometimes.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you know in this day and age you're spoiled by 99 cent iPhone games and so forth so the value is really tough to justify but you know there's like 60 some odd songs in the game and I keep unlocking stuff and I've been having fun with it you know as a music game fan there hasn't really been a music game I've been into in a long time you know Beatmania 2DX kind of like stopped a
and um I hadn't imported those games in the longest time anyway so it hasn't been a whole lot for me to get really excited about lately so DJ Max is a nice little this is a music game that that doesn't feel like the same old shit I've been playing for a long time it's not falling notes hitting the bar at the bottom like it's something a little different it's something that could really only be done on the Vita as well as it is um
I think it's a worthy purchase if you're a music game fan and a Vita owner.
But again, that $45 price tag, it's a tough pill to swallow when you sit it next to iPhone.
This is why a lot of people are saying the iPhone and the iPad and iOS is really hurting PlayStation Vita and 3DS because those games are this much money and we can download decent games for 99 cents on iOS.
Yeah.
There you go.
So Shane's yelling at me because the band is Cara, not Step.
Step is their song that I keep thinking of.
And yells at me saying this review fails.
Well, technically there is a band named Steps, isn't there?
I think there was.
They did some stuff for DDR, Euromix, I want to say.
Mm-hmm.
But I'm not giving it a bad review.
I'm just saying the price tag is a tough pill to swallow next to $0.99, $1.99, iPad, iOS games.
That's the reality.
So I may not be as in touch with the music games as I used to be, but if I'm having a hard time swallowing a lot of this stuff, what do you think about the general public who really has to be able to buy this game in order for it to be very successful?
Just saying.
So I played DJ Max Technica, which I did enjoy overall.
When you die, you got to go chase down your body, except now your body is another zombie.
That whole thing is there.
A lot of heavy influence from that series.
But I got to say, they do the Wii U peripheral and all that stuff very well.
Like just the way they integrate the second screen, like a little scanner device that you use to kind of scan the room around you and also be an illuminating light.
When you have a sniper rifle, you can use it to zoom in on zombies and so forth.
Just kind of neat the way they integrate the Wii U controller.
They almost do it better than Nintendo Land, which is a little weird.
The problem with Zombie U is it's not going to be for everybody.
It's a mature title.
It's zombies.
Not everybody is into the zombie scary stuff.
But if you're willing to sit down and spend some time with it, it's a good launch title.
It's a really solid launch title that really shows off the system almost better than some of the first party games do, I gotta say.
So...
I haven't spent enough time with it.
I still need to touch the multiplayer mode.
I hear there's a lot of Nintendo Network influence, like you find your friends' zombies are out there in the world or whatever.
But just to give you an example, you will be out in the world doing your thing, and then if you get bitten by a zombie, you're dead.
You're reborn as another survivor, basically.
Like another survivor is discovered and you show up in the safe house.
If you want to go get your stuff, you have to go find your old self and kill yourself, basically, and steal the bag.
And so it's... I like that.
It's neat.
But it was seen before in Demon's Souls.
But maybe Ubisoft's kind of banking on maybe a lot of people didn't play that or...
I don't know, there's lots of Zelda knockoffs out there in the world.
Why not a Demon's Souls knockoff?
It was a good game.
Also, that same insane high level of difficulty.
But I do have to hand it to the developers team.
As much as I say, oh, it's Demon's Souls with zombies, the way they integrate the Wii U device is great.
So, I mean, it is a game that you can really say can only be done on the Wii U. So, they did a good job of that.
Zombie U
Yeah?
What possessed you to do that project?
Well, originally it was because I was going to have it for Josh's first birthday party.
I was going to have that as a centerpiece or something.
I just didn't finish it because the design that I was working off of, the way they had it come together, I mean, it made sense if you're doing a 3D model because the pieces clipped into each other.
But in the real world, you can't just phase an object through something else.
You need to actually have it attach to one surface to the other.
So I had to tweak the model and make it work.
And it was a little bit more difficult and time-consuming.
But now it's done, and it looks somewhat good.
I don't know, it looks neat.
People are like, what's that?
It did look neat.
I saw the pictures on Twitter.
It looked pretty awesome.
Yeah, it's pretty big.
Congrats.
All right.
That's going to do it.
Oh, one other thing I will mention just in a very candid way since you talked about pinball.
I played a theater of magic machine.
For real?
Yesterday.
For real.
Like a real theater.
Not one of the download services or whatever.
I played a real theater of magic machine at a gay bar in San Francisco.
Theater of magic is awesome.
Alan and I went to the city yesterday because his friends are having a house party.
Is it one I know?
I don't, it's called, should I say it on the show?
Oh, whatever.
It's Pilsner Inn, which is over, it's like Castro and Sanchez, I think.
I'm sorry, Market and Sanchez.
Then I don't know that one.
Well, this place was awesome because it's all decorated with penguins.
You know I love penguins.
And there's all these penguin decorations in there.
And then they have a Theater of Magic pinball machine in the back.
Theater of Magic is great.
This is like a bar that was made for me.
And the guy gave me a free soda.
Because I wasn't drinking.
I was a designated driver, so they give the free sodas.
That was cool.
Keep you alert.
Even though we were walking, I actually wasn't really driving that night, but it worked out.
So, yes, I played Theater of Magic as well.
It was hard.
It's not... I mean, it depends on how they have the rules set on it, but I mean, it's not that easy of a machine.
It was a five ball for the credits, but I swear that ball in there was weighted because it just flew down the table.
It was crazy.
Oh, Alan's correcting me.
It was Church and Market.
That was close.
I want to see the penguins now.
Oh, I took a picture.
I put it on Facebook.
I'll show you on my phone here in a minute.
Alright, but we have to get into housekeeping and then the real gaming news.
Housekeeping, join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
Speaking of Facebook, you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
We are also on Google Plus and that's the place where you can always answer the Fugle Question of the Week, which we'll get to in Part B. If you haven't answered it yet, now would be a great time.
We'll get into that a little later.
Meanwhile, let's get into video gaming news, starting off with Loki.
Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about Steam and some of the updates they're doing.
They've got some new... Well, they have the new wallet enabled, the Steam Wallet, which will allow you to kind of tie in with different community stuff.
Mainly, it's right now being used with Team Fortress 2, and it allows you to buy and sell items, I guess, using your Steam Wallet funds.
So you can make some custom hats or something like that and sell them for...
GameGuides.com
as part of the community beta and it's basically like game facts sort of.
People can create facts or guides or whatever and then you'll see them on the different games.
You just click guides and you see all the user-made guides.
So that's pretty cool.
It's always good that they're adding more features.
Why do you think they want to put GameFAQs into Steam?
Well, I think what they're trying to do is try to have it all encompassing because if you think about it, if they're trying to go for this big picture mode and stuff like that, they want you to stay in client rather than, oh, I got to leave this client to go look up how to beat this boss or something like that.
They just want you to stay in the Steam client as much as possible, I think is the reason why they're doing that.
I guess that's pretty cool, because too many times when I've been playing a game, and if I need the assistance of a guide or whatever, I have to have that next to me, the iPad sitting next to me, or a book even, or whatever.
And they're not the only ones that have done that kind of stuff.
I mean, look at IGN.
IGN did the same kind of thing.
They have these wikis and guides now for different games, and it's all the same reasons.
Before with IGN, it was like, okay, get some game news and information and stuff, but...
Oh, I need to look up how to beat this boss or how to finish this level or something like that.
And before, you'd have to either go to the forums, and hopefully there's a post about it there, or you'd go to a GameFAQs or something like that and go look it up.
And once again, you're leaving their website.
They don't want you to leave their website.
They want you to stay and soak in as much advertisement as possible.
Well, I mean...
I guess it's also kind of like a valuable way to stay relevant too because so many people are after those types of guides.
It's a good way to kind of give visibility to your site and so forth.
I guess it's just kind of how they're staying relevant in this day and age.
Alan in chat says, make Steam a one-stop shop for all aspects of fandom.
Buy the game, play the game, multiplayer, matching service, mods, DLC, FAQs, chat and IM, friends list, in-game overlay, alt tab lists.
It's true.
It has seemed to be what they're going for.
And fanfiction.
Soon fanfiction?
And slash?
No, no, no.
There is no slash pizza within Steam yet.
Who knows?
Shopping.
Non-game stuff coming soon, maybe.
Who knows?
Going to the Wii U, another place where apparently you can do a lot of things.
You can go into Miiverse without interrupting the game.
That second screen there allows you to do a lot.
But more stuff about the whys in the Wii U. A lot of news that explains the whys.
First off,
Why is there no online multiplayer in Nintendo Land?
A lot of people picked up Nintendo Land and maybe they don't have brothers and sisters or people that they live with to play the Nintendo Land games with.
So they have to wait for a party to come around to play a third of the pack-in games on Nintendo Land.
So why did they do it that way?
Well, producer Katsuya Iguchi, in an interview with Famitsu Magazine, said, quote, So in other words, they were ignoring the internet from the very beginning when it came to Nintendo Land.
Hmm.
Hmm.
And who was surprised?
Also, apparently Metroid Blast was originally supposed to be a Star Fox themed mini game.
Did you notice that there was no Star Fox game in the Nintendo Land?
Well, Metroid was originally going to be Star Fox.
Quote,
for example a game with air and ground battles works well with Metroid there was a time when Metroid Blast was going to be a Star Fox title but the prototype featured this vehicle that hovered around like a helicopter and we figured that'd never be a good match for an R-Wing
Interesting reason why they chose that.
I mean, the Metroid thing works fine, but it's interesting to hear that like, oh, it was totally this other series before.
Also interesting to hear kind of confirmation in a way that all they did was take all those prototypes.
What series can we shove this into?
What series can we shove into this?
That's what it should have been.
It shouldn't have been Hogan's Alley.
It should have been the Konami title.
Yeah, but Nintendo's not Konami.
Legend of the Mystical Ninja?
Yeah.
Goemon?
Yeah, sure.
Also, a follow-up to something we talked about last week.
Why...
Does Europe block the Wii U content late at night?
The mature rated 18 plus content late at night.
Well, Nintendo Europe came out with an explanation this week.
Blame it on Germany.
Quote, at Nintendo we always aim to provide a safe gaming experience for fans of all ages and ensure that we comply with applicable legal age restrictions across Europe.
and it was re-emphasized this is not the rule in the US.
At least not yet.
Refer to our discussion earlier in the show if you think that we may not be headed in that direction.
Don't buy the content digitally then.
Unless it's DLC, in which case you're kind of stuck, but don't buy those games digitally.
Go to the store.
All the more reason you should just go to the store where it's convenient, and then you know what?
Hey, I'm not playing Assassin's Creed 3 anymore on the Wii U. Maybe I want to pick up the next Assassin's Creed game that comes out.
Maybe I can trade in my old game, get some credit towards a new game.
Oh, can't do that with my digital copy, so...
All right, let's move on with some more news.
DarkSakura.
Mass Effect.
Mass Effect, all the things.
Oh, God.
All the Mass Effecting.
Actually, this is about Mass Effect 4, but I have an update to it before I tell the story.
This is coming from a story that was teased on Gamer Syndrome, and Eurogamer, bless them, they actually heard from an EA representative saying,
saying that it wasn't Gamble, it was some other Bioware team member.
And so they went back and contacted Gammer Syndrome and said the source was actually unreliable.
However, I'm going to talk about it anyway because it's Mass Effect.
so the rumor is what I'm going to put this as is going that Mass Effect 4 is supposed to have information out next year and launch in late 2014 to mid 2015 and they don't have an exact date on it um
They're saying that basically they haven't decided if it's a sequel or prequel, but that there is supposed to be one more batch of Mass Effect 3 DLC coming out, which honestly, if it's that rumor going around that it supports the indoctrination thing, I'm going to flip a table.
But they were also talking about other scrapped ideas that they wanted in Mass Effect 3, like going to Paladin or different changes in the final battle, and that they wanted multiplayer in Mass Effect 2, but it wasn't going to happen.
Um, so, uh, we'll see what happens.
I mean, it sounds like it's not far-fetched.
I think a lot of it is just theorizing, though, you know?
Like, it's so far away.
They could change so much.
They probably talked to, like, some guy who was in the meeting when they were bringing up stuff for a timeline.
Yeah.
Although I do think it's funny that they used the brochette picture of him looking horrified.
I'm really happy to hear, though, that Shepard won't come back for Mass Effect 4 because it's just going to make Shane bitch and complain and cry.
I have my own headcanon.
It's okay, Shane.
We can live in our own headcanons.
I think... Well, here's the thing, and this is what I told Shane and what I say openly, is that, you know, it's okay to start a new trilogy because now that there's been so many games, it's gonna be so hard to, in the fourth game, have all those choices from the first three games play out in the fourth game.
And you saw what happens when your choices...
Do not play out into the way it all ends or ties up, right?
With that first ending to Mass Effect.
So I think BioWare wants to just start a new slate and it's fine that they do that.
Because the first Mass Effect trilogy was so great, the second one will be too.
Did you hear, you know about the people doing the happy ending mod for Mass Effect 3?
Well, I finally watched one that involved Garrus as the love interest.
And you could, and actually, I told you I went back and hacked my game to get Kelly in my game.
They use that series of animations from when Kelly is hugging Shepard.
And so Garrus' face does all this weird, like his plates over his eyebrows move so funny, it's absolutely hilarious.
I'm like, he looks like a sad puppy.
So, just saying, it's funny.
As long as Mass Effect trilogies don't go the way of Star Wars trilogies, we'll all be fine.
Just throwing it out there.
It already can't because the ending of Star Wars 6 or whatever you want to call it, the ending was like the best ending ever.
And the ending of Mass Effect 3, well, some people weren't so thrilled about it.
Anyhow, Loki.
All right.
So we talked a little bit about how there was already some of the old homebrew stuff for the Wii that was enabled with the Wii Channel on the Wii U.
But the one thing that wasn't working yet was the Homebrew Channel.
However, now that's not the case.
The Homebrew Channel does work now because they've released a brand new version that will work with the original Wii and also the brand new Wii Channel on the Wii U.
so that's kind of interesting and basically that allows you to do some of the stuff that you could do before using the homebrew channel including I think run stuff off of hard drives like ISOs and stuff like that but also other homebrew stuff is available I'm not sure if there's any sort of limitations on what you can run on the homebrew channel if they've got some stuff locked out for the Wii U because I know there was some limitations before
Oh, I guess one of the things that I guess won't work is Boot Me, but they haven't really figured out.
They may just make a new release with Boot Me support later on, but I don't think that was necessarily something that required for like...
I never did ISO loading off of the Homebird channel, so I really don't know.
But yeah, Homebird channel 1.2 is now available.
Or I guess the HackMe installer 1.2 with the Homebird channel version 1.1.2.
So that you can download off of HackMe.com So Nintendo will patch this out in the next little update they do Because TV, I would think TV has got to be out next week Because they announced that for December, right?
And they're going to want to get it out before the holidays Because they're going to send
I mean, although, yes, Nintendo's based in Japan and it might not be the exact time off that it is here.
I don't know if they can.
I mean, they can keep patching.
They patch it by blocking the title ID, but then they just change the title ID number for it and then it works again.
So I don't really know if they can block it or if they're even going to try because it's Wii stuff.
Do you think they'll try to get this through the main menu as opposed to having to go into Wii and all that stuff?
Try to get Wii U Homebrew Channel?
Is that probably a goal?
Well, originally with the Homebrew Channel, the way they got through it was with the GameCube emulation stuff.
So it's possible they could do that.
If they find some way to exploit it, they could possibly do like a Wii U Homebrew Channel.
Does that mean Homebrew Channel doesn't work on newer Wiis that don't have GameCube emulation?
Or is that...
No longer a factor.
I don't think it's a factor.
I thought the first homebrew came through Twilight Princess was some type of hack through that game.
Yeah, but that was a loader that they ran certain like doll files or whatever, the dolphin files.
So I don't think... I mean, because you can run those and you can run... There's some other type of file format that you can run as well.
So I don't think it's necessarily going to be blocked in those that don't have that emulation anymore because it still may load those file formats.
It just may not...
you know it just doesn't have the physical stuff to do GameCube so I don't know so but hypothetically if homebrew channels working instead of waiting an hour for the Pikmin to move all my crap from the Wii to the Wii U because I have all my games backed up to hard drive on the Wii if I get homebrew channel running I can just run them off homebrew channel now right maybe
Off HD Loader or whatever it is.
Maybe I'll do that.
I'm not really sure because, like I said, I don't know if they have any limitations.
I don't know what exactly they need as far as iOS exploits because I remember before when you're updating that stuff, you'd have to have certain iOSes loaded in and certain modded iOSes when they do a new update or something like that.
You'd have to patch those in order to get things to work.
And since I never...
See, I never really needed to do off of a hard drive because I had a physical mod chip in there.
Why bother doing that?
You can just burn a disk.
I don't know what you needed to do that.
I'm not sure if they can run stuff off of hard drives anymore.
Thank you for watching!
but wasn't like the Dreamcast supposed to be proprietary as well and you can just burn the CDRs?
Yep.
There was like garbage data that you'd have to sift through but other than that
So, I mean, you know, it may be proprietary, so maybe they'll just have some sort of drive emulator that runs to a USB drive or something, or they'll find a way to load games onto the hard drive.
I'm sure, I mean, come on, this has only been out for like a month now, so it's still very early, and the fact that they have the Homebrew channel running is...
Kind of shows that Nintendo just didn't give a shit because they didn't really do that much to patch it out.
They could have blocked the exploit to do it, but they just didn't.
The Secret World is going to be going what they call buy-to-play.
Not free to play, because it's not going to be completely free.
Think of the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 model.
You buy the game, and now you can play online.
I like that model, to be honest.
I think it's a great model.
Obviously, I like it too.
But there still will be some different tiers.
There's going to be free, member, and grandmaster.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
XP bonuses, bonus points in-game, special monthly gift, 10% discount in the in-game store.
If you're Grandmaster, you get another 10% off in-game purchases, etc., etc.
So definitely this model is going to lure a lot of people into checking this game out who might have written it off at first because, you know, who wants to pay $15 a month for yet another MMO or what have you.
There's an announcement trailer that came out for the game.
The announcement trailer is called Pay Once, Play Forever.
Here's my thing, though.
Not to doubt Funcom or whatever, but Play Forever?
Isn't that a little misleading?
Play Forever for seven years or so.
Maybe.
It just makes me glad I didn't buy my lifetime membership for Star Trek Online.
Because the very next year, free to play.
Right.
Well, at least Star Trek Online is still going.
You know, at least Star Wars is still going.
Come on, Final Fantasy XI.
Come on.
This game came out way after you did.
I mean, come on.
You've made your money already, right?
Come on.
Free play.
Come on.
You have to wait and see what happens with XIV.
14 is going to try and be subscription based too, so we'll see.
But anyway.
WoW is still working though.
I don't know what would happen if Final Fantasy XI comes by to play.
I don't know.
But back to forever.
I mean, how many games have we seen?
I like Immortal Talking.
Play until you're sick of us.
Well, how many games have we seen that just kind of shut down out of the blue?
Like, you know, City of Heroes, I believe, just pulled the plug where they're about to.
It's right now that it was supposed to be ending.
That's because it was awful anyway.
Don't tell Alan you said that.
I tried to play it.
I thought it was awful.
Matrix Online.
What was that Richard Garriott game, the sci-fi shooter game?
Damn it.
Terra something?
What the hell was it called?
Terra...
I don't know.
It was only around for like two years and then they pulled the plug on it which sucked.
I'll say Terra Nova but that was a show that got canceled.
No, that was a show.
Somebody in chat will say it because I can't remember.
That's a colony in Mass Effect.
Was it Rift?
No, Rift is still kicking, and Rift has a subscription too, and it's doing pretty well.
I mean, it's one of those rare games that's doing very well.
A lot of the kids that are too cool for World of Warcraft go to play Rift.
At least that's the impression I get from internet forums.
So, Tabula Rasa.
Thank you, Dungeon Buster.
That was the name of it.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
Tabula Rasa.
Thank you, Dungeon Buster.
Rob, does that mean that you had a clean slate when you were trying to think of it?
That's what Tabula Rasa means?
Yes, I get it.
I get it.
Yeah, well... Fuck drumming.
Why are you yelling at chatters?
Bobby said fuck Mass Effect and I said fuck drumming.
That was very random.
That was Tourette's-y.
Why...
No, I was responding to our chatters because I pay attention to the chat room.
Oh, okay.
Let's see.
TigerClaw in chat says, It sucks being inside an MMO and you're doing missions solo and unable to get help because nobody responds to your requests.
K Saracera says, I love it, but monthly fee was something that almost made me stop playing because I can't MMO and keep my job.
Technus says, Well, as long as they don't screw up their free-to-play model like the old Republic, they should be okay.
ImmortalKing in chat says, play till you're sick of us.
There you go.
DungeonBuster, kind of giving some other background on Tabula Rasa.
Tabula Rasa went through a crazy development shift.
It started off like this weird fantasy sci-fi stuff.
Then it went completely extreme.
So...
There you go.
The secret world going by to play.
And I got to be honest, it's incentive for me personally to want to check it out again.
I mean, how much are they still charging 60 for it?
I don't think they are.
It was on sale for like 30 at one point.
So I'll have to see, especially with the Steam sale coming up.
Steam sales coming.
Brace yourselves.
Where's our picture?
I'm not ready.
Where's our picture of who's that guy?
Is that Viggo Mortensen from one of those Game of Thrones or one of those shows?
Brace yourselves.
Steam sale's coming.
Lord.
Alright, DarkSakura, you gotta know the story for us.
You've broken my brain, Rob.
That's why I'm here.
How about, well, here's a game I think that we're all a fan of it.
Ghosts and Goblins, right?
Yeah, I like Ghosts and Goblins.
I'm aware of it.
Pfft.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, um, you can actually, uh, it's got, uh, influences like from, uh, Shinobi, a few other things in there, Karnov, Trojan, different things that are thrown in.
But it's basically just as masochistic as playing the, uh, Ghost of Goblin series, or Makaimura.
So, uh, I watched the, um, the trailer and actually I kind of think I want it.
You can actually get the game on the game's site.
Just go to Locomalito.com and you can get it for free.
And of course, you're a Ghosts and Goblins fan, so this doesn't surprise me at all.
This is something you might want.
Do you think you would still be able to tolerate the nauseatingly difficulty of these games?
Good lord.
Well, we were actually... Dan was showing me a version of it that... I want to say it was the Sharp version.
Did they do a version of that for the Sharp computer?
We were watching the Super Graphics version, which I told Dan right then and there I wanted a Super Graphics, where it has all the animation and everything, and it does the charge and all that.
I was like...
I went to SuperGrafx just to play Ghosts and Goblins.
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
Figure out some games that are coming to a console near you.
Or even PC, maybe.
Loki?
There's not a whole lot this week.
It's pretty much just Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Vita.
Which clearly must have been delayed from the rest of it.
Yeah, and even the 3DS version is not coming out until next year.
Weird.
Yeah, it's kind of disappointing.
That is literally it.
Well, the holiday games have to be out by now.
Yeah, the next few weeks are going to be nothing.
All right.
Well, there's some stuff going on in Japan.
You know, it's a little different in Japan.
So there's some games still coming out this week.
Call of Duty Black Ops 2 on the Xbox 360 Dubbed Edition makes its way out on December 20th.
Do you know who publishes it in Japan?
Call of Duty Black Ops 2?
Somebody.
It's not Activision.
In Japan.
It's not who you'd expect.
Take two.
Square Enix.
Square Enix.
Publishes it.
That actually doesn't surprise me.
Square Enix does a lot of localization work.
Well, yeah, that and now that they have the Eidos part of it, too.
You know, that we've seen some very different games coming out of that company.
So, you know, I just thought it was interesting.
But anyway, also, Shin Hokuto Musou.
That's a regular and treasure box edition.
And there's all these, like, Xbox Live cards coming out around this, too.
I believe this is a Fist of the North Star game.
Is it Hokuto no Ken?
It's a reimagination of Hokuto Musou.
It's probably Fist of the North Star, too.
Yeah, I can tell by the logo.
It's the Fist of the North Star, Ken's Rage 2.
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
That is exactly what it is based off the little YouTube trailer.
Oh yeah, totally.
Totally.
You can see from the screenshots that's what it is.
Extra blood?
Yes.
So that's coming out over here in February.
Oh, okay, there you go.
That game also coming out on the PlayStation 3, as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.
Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box.
Remember that box with, like, everything Final Fantasy in it?
That's out in Japan this week.
Catherine gets a price reduction.
Call of Duty Dubbed Edition is on the PlayStation 3 as well.
There's a whole PlayStation 3 console around Shin Hokuto Musou, so obviously the Fist of the North Star stuff is big over there, much bigger than I give it credit for.
Also in regular and luxury limited editions this week, Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka o Kirisaku Hikari Tukage comes out.
This is not a series I recognize.
It looks a little tactical with anime chicks.
That could have been like every Japanese game ever.
But anyway, that is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
Going to the PlayStation Vita...
AKB149 Renai Sosenkyo comes out from Bandai Namco this week also in regular and limited box editions let's see looking at the that was the Vita let me look at the Wii U now that that is out in Japan Sports Connection and the Family Party or Simple Series for Wii U Volume 1 I'm sure that is their equivalent of what the hell is that called over here 30 party games
Yeah, it's a family party.
The most hilarious Miiverse board you will find on the entire system.
That's the one I made you read last week, remember?
Yeah.
On the Nintendo 3DS this week, Tongari Bushi to Maho no Machi comes out, as well as Osare de Kawaii Konyo to Asobo Umihen comes out as well.
I have no idea what any of these games are.
What?
Osare de Kawaii
That's adorable.
It had Asobi in the title, didn't it?
Who doesn't want to play Games of Puppies?
It's like playing Games of Puppies.
Who doesn't want to play Games of Puppies?
That's the best title for a game ever, playing Games of Puppies.
I like playing Games of Puppies.
I would say they should localize that and put that out here, but let's be real.
Those puppy and kitty games are a dime a dozen.
Would you buy a game that was called Playing Games with Puppies?
If it had a corgi on the cover, maybe.
Hell yeah.
Alright, let's do a couple more news stories in the classic game of the week.
Loki.
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, you know, kind of what we talked about last week with some servers going down for like Sniper Elite and Neverwinter Nights.
And of course, you know, there was a whole thing with, well, GameSpy, why are they, you know, taking this stuff down?
Because, you know, they're saying that, oh, you know, I guess it's just the company's, you know, Rebellion is taking it down because they just don't want to continue with it.
Well,
That's not true.
Glue Mobile, since they were the ones that bought GameSpy, apparently they've upped the rates.
And they've basically said, not even really in a polite manner, they've basically said, well, they've decided to discontinue service with us because they're not paying their fees.
But what they forgot to mention is we raised our fees quite a bit more than what they were before.
So that's why these games are no longer on their sites because Glue is trying to charge too much for the middleware that they're using.
Ouch.
Kind of sucks.
They got to be careful because they're not the only company out there that does this stuff.
So if you're going to be assholes about it, I hear Steam's pretty good.
Mm-hmm.
Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week, and this is about a game called Oculus Rift, which is... It's a peripheral.
Oh, okay.
Did I do my games...
Oh, you didn't do your releases, did you?
No, I didn't.
Oh, my bad.
I've been waiting, and I was like, geez, Rob!
Well, we were too busy being occupied with cute puppy games.
Well, then do your release dates.
Okay.
In the UK, on December 17th is Street Fighter X Mega Man on PC.
December 18th is Escape Vector with a K. December 19th is Escape Vector with a K on the 3DS.
And the 21st, Fuel Overdose in Vectropolis.
There, Rob.
I wonder if Fuel Overdose is like a sequel to Fuel.
That'd be awesome.
I don't think it is.
I doubt it.
Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset.
This group in Irvine, it's a startup called Sinful Robot.
They are looking at this device to do, quote, the world's first series of fully immersive erotic encounters.
All right.
Hell yes.
Apparently, they're posting for different 3D artists and animators.
I guess, of course, news about this hit Reddit and Sinful Robot actually got the thread and said, thanks to the device, quote, we can finally make an erotic adventure game that will actually be exciting.
All right.
It'll be in 3D.
That's right.
Virtual reality.
Those tits will be in 3D and it's just anywhere you look.
Titties, titties, titties, titties.
All around you.
DarkSakura just looked down.
I wish it was a TV show.
All right.
Want to sell systems?
Just add porn.
That's the secret.
All right.
Let's go to a time when games were a little simpler.
Okay.
much simpler erotic games were bubble bath babes that was your erotic game
or Custer's Revenge.
Acidic Vampire in chat says, how about fucking someone in real life?
You can't beat that.
They will try.
Some people can't do that.
You know what?
That's why there's toys.
Alright.
Moving on to the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
Going into the vault, picking out a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should play this game.
And because it's episode 486, you remembered to pick a PC game, right?
Yeah.
Oops.
Oops.
That's okay.
I picked something that I brought up a bajillion times before but actually never covered.
Then what is the classic game of the week?
Panorama Cotton.
Yay.
Panorama Cotton is... I'm sure other people have heard of Cotton since I've brought up the Cotton series a bunch of times.
The original Cotton series were like side-scrolling shooters.
This one actually plays closer to Space Harrier.
And it was put out on the Genesis slash Mega Drive in 1994, only in Japan, by Success.
And on top of that, it's supremely rare.
They did like 600 copies of the damn game.
You really... Now, I have actually seen a copy and have actually held a copy because a friend of mine owns a copy of this.
However, she lives in... You're special.
Yes.
However, she lives in Nagoya right now.
So, Cotton is...
Well, it's just a very interesting little game.
I mean, you basically fly around with the cameras behind you and you shoot stuff.
And then you have the crazy little witch named Cotton.
So if you want to go into the story about this, Cotton runs into this little fairy.
Her fairy partner is Silk, but she runs into one named Nit, who tells her that the queen is starting to say things that don't make sense.
So she goes off to see what happens and doesn't come back.
So Silk and Nit start pulling this willow, which is this candy stuff that Cotton is super addicted to and she eats it and then she throws up and it's hilarious.
But Cotton sees the burnt piece of willow and eats it anyway and then says that she's really pissed off that people have, you know, burned the willow.
So now she's going after to save the day all for purely selfish reasons.
So, I mean, you basically, you're flying around on your little broom shooting stuff, and you're getting these little balls that give you power-ups and points, and it's just super cute.
Like, the part that Rob's looking at right now, you're flying over a rainbow stream in the middle of a desert.
and it's just super cute.
The game that was one of the very first games I ever brought up for Classic Game was Panorama Cotton that was the direct style sequel to Panorama Cotton which you can't get in the US.
It's super fun.
Just go play it.
It's like Space Harrier but totally cute.
And if you have $300 to $500, you can own your own copy.
Words can't express the giant lady boner you have for this series.
I love cotton.
I mean, it's just so on crack.
And I mean, seriously, if I could afford this cartridge, I would so buy it.
I would have it in a second.
I will tell people that are looking to emulate it, there are some Genesis emulators that will not run this game because it was fairly complicated, like I said, and they didn't do very many copies.
However, you can find ROM dumps of it, and I think that Gens is the emulator that I used to use to play it.
So, good luck.
Oh, by the way, I think there are repro cartridges of this that you can order that will work on US Genesis.
Well, then there you go.
I'll see if I can find it.
Your classic game of the week, Panorama Cotton for the Genesis.
Good luck finding a copy, but it sounds like you can at least do emulators.
Checking eBay real quick.
You kids can experience it.

Alright, we're going to take a break.
When we come back though, there is plenty more of Orange Launch Radio to come.

You won't believe what game series he's doing next.
We're going to talk about that as well as some rapid fire news.
What?
118 bucks right now.
That's less than you said earlier.
With the buy it now.
When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio, stay tuned everybody.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on this December the 16th of 2012 with the 486th episode of our show.
That's right, 486.
Since DarkSakura neglected to do the PC connection, I'll ask Loki.
What's a favorite game of yours you remember from the 486 days on the PC?
What was a game that you remember loving on the 486th?
Um, I would say probably, even on the 486, I was still playing Castle Wolfenstein.
Yeah.
Um, so, I don't think I had a 486.
I had a 386.
My friend had a 486, and he had played Doom.
Um, I'd say also maybe, uh, Command & Conquer Red Alert, the first one.
Mm-hmm.
Um, what else did we play?
Um.
I didn't have a well no I did have a 486 actually my first computer was a 386 SX16 and then the next computer was a 486 I think 100 or something was the speed of those things and then after that was finally the Pentium but I had the 486 for a while that was probably my Civilization 1 days loved Civ 1 I was just I was a Sid Meier fanboy in general because like Covert Action Railroad Tycoon Deluxe I loved all those games Colonization all of them
DarkSakura, did you have PC games you played back then?
You've kind of always been more console, haven't you?
Yeah, I've always been more console.
Until now.
Well, yeah.
But on my friends, I actually was really into Doom.
I was really into Hexen.
Really into Hexen.
Oh, yeah.
Hexen was badass.
And Descent.
Because I told you about my friend's rig where he had it set up with a chair to play Descent.
And, crap, there was another game.
Oh, my friend and I would actually go through Phantasmagoria.
Oh, which I think I've reviewed Phantasmagoria on the show before.
Oh, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
Yeah, but we would.
Seven CDs full of awesomeness.
Yeah.
And what was the other game?
Probably Gabriel Knight.
No, I wasn't really into Gabriel Knight.
Jazz Jackrabbit.
Jill of the Jungle, Good Times.
No, just Jazz Jackrabbit.
I remember when Commander Keen 4 came out, everybody lost their shit because it was like Commander Keen Mario style.
Like the first Commander Keen was not so, but like Commander Keen 4 was like, oh my God, it's like Mario.
All that stuff was awesome.
Speaking of those games, not to give free commercials to a website, but you know what?
They're doing a pretty awesome thing.
GOG.com, if you visit the site that sells the old games.
I don't know if it's still going on.
Maybe the chatters can check, but they were giving away Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition.
Oh, it's over?
Yeah, it's over.
Did you say Hanukkah Edition?
No, Atomic.
I was like, what?
They were giving it away for Hanukkah, apparently, because it was about those same days, but...
It was... I want to say it was only through the 18th, maybe?
Or maybe it's done.
I can't remember if it was... Let's see here.
But they have a lot of old games that I remember from that era that are... Because I was actually looking into Populous the other day, because somebody brought up Peter Molyneux, and I was thinking about the other games he'd done, like Black and White and stuff, and I was like, oh, Populous was an awesome game.
I remember my other big game.
What's that?
Loom.
Oh, yes.
I freaking loved Loom.
I played through that game so many times.
And you remember when it came out on Steam?
Guess who had it?
Actually, I had bought a PC copy CD before and then it came out on Steam.
Yeah, Loom's a great choice.
Good stuff.
All right.
Yeah, I think it's over.
It looks like Actdeft is confirming Duke Nukem was free till Thursday.
And Porkchop says the offer is over.
It was pretty cool, though.
That is all from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
I did pick it up, though.
That was the first LAN game I ever played was Duke Nukem 3D.
I used to call into a BBS to play.
Actually, I think it was...
It was Doom 2.
You would call the BBS and you could do games, but then they'd want to charge you for each minute on the first 30 or something.
Duke Nukem 3D was a game that I played a lot on on my Pentium, I think.
Go ahead.
I used to work at MobyCon for a couple years and we had a big setup with Duke Nukem 3D.
You could also do your voice macros so we could put in your face, your ass, what's the difference, and all the ones that we liked.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and since you know in it's like you're living in these tiny little like rooms right but everybody had their own phone line so we would use the phone lines to connect Duke Nukem and so I'd be playing in my room he'd be playing in his room we'd have the doors open yelling at each other on like a Friday night or whatever and all the other guys would be like what the fuck are those nerds up to and so they'd walk into the room and they'd be like oh and so the
What they do, they'd go into one room and then they'd see where we're at and then come in the other room and tell one of us like, oh, you got to go get him.
He's over there or whatever.
So those are some fun nights.
Actually, as much of a nerd as I was and picked on for that, I was very popular because I had the only Super Nintendo with Mario Kart.
And those guys always wanted to come over and play Mario Kart.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Sailor Moon.
So they would come over to my room to watch all the anime because also my friend, who was the same one that built the descent chair, would just copy me all kinds of fun stuff.
And we would do our own personal dub to Ura Tsukidoji, the Legend of the Everfiend.
Oh yes, yes, I know Ura Tsukidoji.
And then play Toshinden all night.
It was epic.
BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I was popular because of Mario Kart 64.
See, I didn't get a Nintendo 64 right away, but the people that lived right above me did.
And they got one right – because it was like the holidays that year that I was a freshman in the dorms that that system came out.
They got one right away, and you better believe they were the popular kids when they got that.
I mean even –
I was up there as much as possible, too, playing, I guess it was Mario 64 at the time, because Mario Kart wasn't a release title.
Maybe it was a year after.
I can't remember now.
It's been a while.
Because I thought they had Mario Kart, but maybe that was like the next semester or something like that.
I can't remember.
My memory's fading.
But yeah, they definitely had a Nintendo 64 upstairs.
And, you know, at the time it was like, dude, the graphics in this are so good.
and then I got a Playstation like the next year and I probably I missed an unhealthy amount of class thanks to Final Fantasy 7 and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 fuck that game seriously alright yeah Blackwolf says the N64 came out at Christmas but Mario Kart didn't come out until right around spring break so I was kind of close they got the system at Christmas and then I remembered like I thought I played Mario Kart up there they must have got it the second semester before the end of the year
Good times.
All right.
Let's move on and get back into some gaming news with some rapid fire news.
Loki.
All right.
So Minecraft, of course, has sold a lot of copies and 5 million of those now are the Pocket Edition.
And, of course, the franchise is now up to 17.5 million copies.
And I'm sure a lot of those are the Xbox Live Arcade version as well.
and um right now they are up to i guess the next update is going to be 0.51 wait i thought pocket edition was specifically the phones they consider xbox live pocket edition no i'm saying the total sales are 17.5 oh oh sorry so um so i said i'll bet a bunch of that is the xbox live arcade version no
So anyways, the phone version or iOS version or whatever, Pocket Edition is going to be receiving an update soon.
It's 0.51, and I guess that's going to include online multiplayer.
It says right now you can play, but it has to be on local Wi-Fi and not through the Internet.
So that would be kind of cool that you can be able to play worlds through the Pocket Edition.
It's probably a good thing, though, that it doesn't work with our current servers because...
I don't know.
That might be bad.
One of the things I forgot to mention was at my game week, they had a thing this week they were giving away.
It's this company, PowerA, and they have these controllers called the Amogas.
Basically, it's a Bluetooth controller that you can snap your phone into and play games on.
They were giving it away with Modern Combat 4, that new Gameloft game.
And
I hope that's the case.
Anyways, Retro City Rampage, a game that's pretty awesome on the Vita and PlayStation Network, supposed to be coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade and WiiWare services, and it's been a while since this was released.
It originally came out in the beginning of October, and that was also on PC as well.
And now it's actually in certification for Xbox Live Arcade and WiiWare, so probably in the next few weeks.
I'd say by the end of the year you're going to see a release for this.
which is pretty awesome.
So definitely worth checking out if you've got those systems.
and last but not least I don't know if I should be scared about this thankfully it's not for quite a few years but uh the Angry Birds movie is moving forward now they've got um you know some people attached to it including I guess the producer um John Cohen has signed on he's the guy that did uh Despicable Me and also uh David Macell who did I guess producing on Iron Man and um
I don't know, the movie's not supposed to be out until summer of 2016.
Which, hopefully Angry Birds is still a thing by then.
Because, you know, these franchises sometimes kind of disappear in a few years, so...
You know, I wish I could say I cared about the Angry Birds movie, but I don't.
I have no fucking clue what the hell it would be about.
Would it just be a bunch of birds exploding on impact?
I especially give no shits about the Angry Birds movie now that they confirmed Tron 3.
So, you know what?
That's the only gaming movie I need in my life.
But it's Ender's Game.
It's awesome.
So it'll be cool.
And I hope that God by 2016, Ready Player One better fucking be a movie because they've already sold the movie rights to it.
It better be a fucking movie by then.
As much as Bobby doesn't want me to keep bringing this up on the network, Mass Effect.
is gonna be a movie from Legendary Pictures.
But here's the thing.
Here's what'll make it worth it.
Because all the fanboys and fangirls are gonna rage.
Because it's not gonna be done right.
Like, you know they're gonna fuck up that movie.
Because, like, you know, let's say if they cast a man to play Shepard in the Mass Effect movie, there's gonna be all these people that are like, Femme Shepard, get the fuck out.
This movie isn't canon.
Fuck it.
Which...
to some extent as much as I enjoy Mass Effect when I play as male Shepard so I can like have my gay time with Kaden if they did a movie around FemShep I would not complain I really think they do need to do the movie as FemShep I'm trying to think of the worst person they could cast for like Shepard in that for male or The Rock no no no no they got they gotta you gotta be thinking worse than that Freddie Prinze Jr.
how about that that's because he's Vega
Yeah, but I wouldn't want to play Vega, though.
No, but I honestly would love to see them just do a CG movie and have the same voice.
Because honestly, to quote a mutual friend of mine in Becky's, Mass Effect is the best movie I've ever played.
Rob Schneider as...
Alright, enough of that Angry Birds movie.
But seriously though, I don't understand how there's no story to the game.
That's like making Tetris the movie.
It doesn't make any sense.
At least when you try to do Super Mario Bros.
movie, there's a general plot.
Angry Birds is like, these pigs are bad and they blow up.
It's a puzzle game.
You can't make a fucking movie out of a puzzle game.
I understand that you think that you can because you want to have money, but there's just... I don't know.
What would be a reasonable actress, like one that would not cost millions of dollars that could be FemShep?
I think the girl with the dragon tattoo.
What's her name?
Numi Rapace or something like that?
I don't know.
Could be it.
Because... I don't know.
Then there's that part that's like, oh, Scarlett Johansson.
But I don't know.
I don't...
I can't see it.
Honestly, no, no, no, no, no.
The one who played Maria Hill.
Because there's actually a Photoshop thing out there where they put her in the armor and everything as female shepherd.
And she looked the part.
She was perfect.
Wendy Williams-ass.
Hold on, let me look up who she was.
And I'm talking about the Avengers movie.
Hey, Garris, how you doing?
All right, moving on.
I'm going to try to find out who it was that played her.
Some folks in chat talking about Nathan Fillion as Uncharted.
That's what Blackwolf said.
Nathan Fillion needs to do the Uncharted movie first.
Nathan Fillion as Garrus.
No, I'm kidding.
Anyhow.
Okay, Kobe Smulders.
Black Wolf says, how about Jennifer Hale as FemShep?
Here's the thing.
She's a voice actress.
She's not like, there's a big difference between, I mean, she's a great voice actress, but I don't know what her experience is with like stage and movie acting.
If she's got the chops, then sure, why not?
But I'm all for heavy.
I think she's also a little, I hate to say it, she's kind of old for the part.
I think.
Well, Shepard is supposed to be 32.
Not in the first game.
If you look in the timeline for the first game, she's 30.
I thought she was 28 in the first game.
She's supposed to be 32 by Mass Effect 3.
They totally need to do a Heavy Rain movie with voice acting intact.
Jason!
Jason!
I can see them doing a Heavy Rain movie.
Now the guy who does Garrus' voice acting is totally goofy looking.
I brought him up from the episode of Buffy.
However, they should have a general actor and have him do the voice.
And then I will be happy.
All right, moving on.
Let's get away from movie talk.
Let's talk about retro games.
Penn and Teller is sovereign.
Stop.
Stop.
All right.
Getting into retro games.
Capcom Arcade Cabinet is something that's rumored for the 3DS and the Wii U eShop.
No idea what the hell that is.
It's probably just repackaging the same old stuff to try and sell it over again, just like they're doing on the iOS.
There was a Capcom Arcade Collection on...
I don't know the rest of it.
Xbox Live is getting some new apps.
SkyDrive, CNET, Maxim, Karaoke.
They actually just added them this week.
That's pretty cool.
They're not out in every countries, but they're out in the U.S.
at least.
And I think Canada got Maxim and CNET.
No, Canada just got CNET.
And Karaoke and SkyDrive are going out worldwide, except Japan and Japan.
and United Arab Emirates for karaoke.
I imagine that Japan's going to get a different version of the karaoke app.
The karaoke app is interesting because I don't know if you guys have heard about this, but the karaoke app is not where you pay for the app.
You pay for like a rental.
Like I think it's like 10 bucks for a 24 hour period, or maybe it was like three bucks for two hours.
So I don't quote me on that, but it was like, you know, you can pay to rent it, but then it's like all the songs.
for that period of time.
So that's interesting.
You can turn your living room into one of those karaoke studios and have all those songs at your fingertips.
It's an interesting way to do it.
I'd be interested to check it out next time I have a party.
People love karaoke.
SkyDrive by the way there's old Orange Lounge radio episodes on SkyDrive there used to be information on the Orange Lounge radio forums but those are kind of sunsetted now that we have the VOG Network forums maybe DarkTetsuya can post the information on the VOG Network forums there is a SkyDrive login you can use it's just like an on your honor thing please don't go in there and fuck it up because people worked very hard to put in the old episodes but there is like a login you can use for the SkyDrive if you really want I'm just going to warn you it was a very different show back in the first
200 episodes, but if you really want to hear what did episode one sound like, it's on the SkyDrive.
So you can hear that through your 360 now.
You can't even get VOG through your 360, but you can get old-ass OLR episodes thanks to the SkyDrive app.
Pretty cool.
And then Maxim and CNET are just... You can't download VOG episodes using Internet Explorer through the... You can't use the live radio player in Internet Explorer, which is weird.
I don't know why.
Because it's Internet Explorer.
Well, I don't get it.
I thought the audio was protected, but I went to the website where our player, Bobby might know more of the technical end of it, but I went to the website where the player that's on our website comes from, and the test MP3 works okay.
I think it has something to do with the streaming MP3s.
Remember for a long time, Google Chrome wouldn't play VOG Network when we first launched because of security things?
I think it's something similar to that.
I don't know if you can play the mp3s on demand on the show pages I haven't tried that but honestly if you're gonna go to all that trouble just turn on your pc and download the shows come on all right uh also coming to the wii u unepic is a game that's coming to the wii u it's a 2d platformer that features rpg elements uh bosses pets potions and so forth and
DarkSakura
Well, in other gaming news, we have some stuff coming out of Imani Style about a new DDR game.
Well, not really new, because it was supposed to be out in February this year.
It was announced originally as Dance Dance Revolution Gris, and now we have Dance Wars that basically has, it's a follow-up from the Dance Dance Revolution S and S Plus that came out on smartphones, but now has multiplayer functionality and uses social networking.
and no word about a US release but they said there was an international intent to release.
And then OEA.
OEA.
They have rebranded their Play For Free brand into Origin Free To Play.
Yeah, but still Origin sucks.
No one cur to play.
and then a game that fights bullies, Rubber Kid.
Basically it's a Kickstarter that's supposed to be raising money to fight bullying and they're hoping to get $750 to basically do a tie-in book, comic, cyberbullying edition that will get people into the dialogue about bullying and teach kids ways to protect themselves.
So that's it.
Alright, let's get into the Fugle question of the week.
Because every week we ask a question on Facebook and Google.
You slam them together, you get Fugle.
This week in the Fugle Question of the Week kind of ties into something we were asking about earlier on the show.
Or talking about earlier anyway.
When a company launches an online multiplayer game, how long do you believe they are obligated to support that online multiplayer game?
Are you bothered when support is pulled after only two years?
Yay.
Are there any old games you can't play online anymore that you wish you could?
What do you think we could do to convince companies to support that game online?
Yay.
Actdeft says, well, for consoles, they should be set up as long as the console's life cycle.
For example, at least until the next console is launched or a year or two later after it launches.
As for PCs, that's more complicated.
But I would think that if a lot of people are playing the game's multiplayer, they should keep the servers up or at least give the players an alternative or something.
That's from Google+.
Surtur says at least three years or post two sequel versions of the game.
Red Entertainment says it's not about length, it's about usage.
If people are still actively playing the game, the company who made the game should still support it.
The cost of the support also factors in the decision.
However, in the cases of big companies like EA and Activision, the question of supporting a product should not be brought up.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's true, the online pass, I didn't even include that in the question, but yeah, the online pass kinda... Like, I'd be pissed off if, like, a game I played, you know, I had to pay an online pass for, let me say I bought it used, and then it shuts down three years later.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, even, like, look at some of the games, like Saints Row the Third or whatever, that lock system link behind an online pass.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
It's like, what?
System link behind an online pass?
You guys are assholes.
I'm going to some of the answers from Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
TigerClaw says, I noticed only a small handful of games had their online multiplayer pulled, but games like Battlefront 2 still have online, and I see a lot of people playing the game's online multiplayer on the PlayStation 2 version.
So some games never get their support pulled, it seems.
I mean, for a PlayStation 2 game to still have online support, that's pretty... I would have thought Final Fantasy XI was the only one left.
Ragenator says,
I believe a company is only obligated to support online multiplayer until the next incarnation of the game is released.
If a new version isn't released, it should stay online for a minimum of two years.
The percentage of people on these games that are diehard dedicated is far less than the people willing to move on to a new game or the next installment of a game.
I speak from personal experience, of course.
I gotta admit, he's naming some pretty tight windows there.
I mean, until the next incarnation of the game, I mean, if you're EA, that's every year, basically, right?
For the sports games, that means it would only be a year.
But I do get what he's saying is that most people move on
But this online pass thing is going to add an interesting element to it.
And not everybody.
Some people buy those games used.
You buy the previous year because it's cheap and it's pretty much the same thing.
Or say you don't like a version of the game when it comes out and it sucks or something like that.
Like has happened with some of the basketball games.
Like NBA Live, you know, so you buy NBA Live 10, I think that was the last one.
And...
You didn't like it, or you didn't want to buy the next one because it never came out in the last two years.
BlackWolf telling us that game with the online pass that shut down it was EA Sports MMA was the game he's linking to a story that talks about those shutdowns so you know the online pass adds an interesting element is that you know and I'm seeing a common theme in these answers which is you know kind of a logical answer they should only keep them up as long as people are using them which makes sense but even for those let's say there's 20 diehard fans that still play it you know and it's not considered to be enough
Does the plug get pulled on those 20 people who now have paid an additional $10 in the form of an online pass to be there?
We have to pull the plug?
I mean, it's a tricky line to walk, I think.
Anyway, let's read some more answers.
Let's see if we still have a consensus going on.
Burr says,
Well, let me throw this out there.
Would you consider the new SimCity or Diablo 3 an always online experience?
I just had to throw that out there.
It's stupid to me that a shooter, for instance, would be unplayable online just because there's no other option for hosting a game.
In the case of an MMO, though, they should only feel obligated to run it as long as they're turning a profit.
Unfortunately, in the case of City of Heroes, that apparently wasn't enough.
Shame on NCSoft for simply shutting it down instead of handing it off to someone else if the profit wasn't enough for them.
or what about just throwing this out there?
What about opening it up to the public domain?
That's what Phantasy Star Blueburst did, right?
DarkSakura, you follow that more than I did.
When Blueburst closed, didn't they just release everything you needed to do your own private server?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought that was a classy way to do it.
And they let you actually pull off your character data off their server.
That's awesome.
That's classy.
Cram says, Codeman says, Codeman says,
and that is a portion that will never be removed don't remove online play because that person paid money for it so you should support it for life Rob himself says if it's to pay if it's pay to play per month they should support that online multiplayer game if they don't it should be 100% free unless it's totally crap then burn it with fire well here's my question does pay to play online mean a monthly fee or does it mean online pass
and lastly Mike B says probably until there is only one person playing it online by themselves then shut it down so it does seem to be there's a general consensus amongst the listeners of the answer of you know when the people disappear then so should the game although nobody's really naming what that threshold is is that 2% of the initial base is that 10% is it a certain time frame you know where is the point that you pull the plug
Does that mean the next time we have one of these stories about server shutdowns, it's just going to be, oh, well, no biggie.
We knew this was coming.
This is what we've come to accept.
It's interesting to me.
But I like the way Sega did it, I got to say.
I think that's a model for how it should be done is that if companies are going to shut down the online support, then open it up for people who are fans of the game to let it live on if they want, right?
I think so.
I still wish that all of these MMOs would just go the path that Sega did like we discussed.
Alright, let's move on with some other news.
We'll get to the mailbag, the FUs of the week, and phone calls in just a little bit.
First off, more news, Loki.
Alright, so there's going to be a few companies dropped from the NASDAQ 100.
And you may think, oh, THQ.
No, it's actually not THQ.
It is some bigger companies, including Electronic Arts.
Electronic Arts is going to be dropped off there as well as RIM.
And also Netflix is being removed as well.
So kind of interesting that those are being dropped there.
And I guess, of course, they're adding Facebook as well.
Hmm.
Honestly, what does that mean?
No fucking clue, because I don't do finances.
Well, usually if they are, I think the NASDAQ 100 is what, the top 100?
Yeah.
So these, you know, and especially in the case like Facebook, I don't think it's still caught up to where it debuted.
No.
So it hasn't really met investor expectations.
And, you know, these other gaming companies have had kind of a rough year.
This will all go into effect, I guess, on the 24th.
But Netflix had a really shitty year, investor-wise.
I mean, they're gaining ground again for it.
But remember the whole Quickster debacle?
That was this year, right?
It was earlier this year.
That fucked them royally.
And a lot of people pinned the CEO's handling of it, honestly.
And they've been making some smart decisions since then.
The whole Arrested Development, they've been doing a lot right.
But the way they handled that whole Quickster thing, their stock plummeted.
and that probably almost single-handedly.
I'm very happy to see that they finally have added It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
I thought that was always there.
No, no, no, no.
They just added it.
I think they added it back.
But, yeah, I mean, they're doing better, I guess.
I am kind of disappointed, though, that they don't have the game rental service because that would be pretty cool.
Leisure Suit Larry
Yes, and I wasn't sure if this was parody or what, but no.
Leisure Suit Larry and the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the next game that he's slated to score.
In an interview with Polygon, he said, quote, that's my era as a gamer growing up.
This was like a fantasy to work on a game like that.
You know what?
Some artists want to do something radically different when they go from project to project.
And I can't think of something more different than an artistic piece that you could hang on the wall like a painting, like Journey, and then going to Leisure Suit Larry, which hopefully will be better than the last round of those games, which were so bad.
Well, Leisure Suit Larry is just a remake of the first one, so it's going to be good.
Uh...
Not necessarily.
Remakes are not always better.
I had fun with some of the other ones.
The last game they put out was crap.
The one before that wasn't... It was bad, but it wasn't super terrible.
They had some interesting things on there.
The minigames were kind of funny.
It would be awesome to be able to score porn music with an orchestra.
Yeah.
Alright, moving on.
DarkSakura.
Moving forward, we do have some information coming out of Microsoft.
They're finally lifting the Windows Store issue ban with the age 18 rated games.
Basically, that includes Dishonored, Mass Effect 3, Assassin's Creed 3 within the Windows Store.
So they were going to not sell the PEGI 18 titles, but then they rethought it and said they want to expand their commitment to Windows Store games.
So...
It was originally in there that said their app must not contain adult content and metadata must be appropriate for everyone.
But now they're just saying, eh, just let them decide.
You know, it was kind of ridiculous that they removed the whole Microsoft Excel off there because its metadata was fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, Excel.
You know, and some people, that may be a selling point, but, you know.
Well, back in the day, there was like what the hidden gate to hell in Excel back on Windows 3.1.
What?
Yeah, it was, there is programmed into Excel.
It's either Excel or Word, but I think it was Excel.
There was like just a little small bit of data that, you know, you could walk around this little temple.
It was like a temple to something that was hidden in early versions of Excel.
It was just like a developer Easter egg.
I'll find it.
Hold on.
All right.
No, I believe you.
I just had never heard of that.
How funny.
Hmm.
Moving on.
One of them was a flight sim.
That'd be fun.
Machinima.com has reduced their staff by 10%.
This is kind of odd because I thought the company was doing pretty well.
They've got a lot of ties and exclusives and stuff.
They started doing a lot of...
Affiliate Channels
It's hit the editorial group, but we're still doing editorial coverage in a slightly different way.
So, it's just, I guess, they maybe hired too many people for what they need.
Just more... Badly managed.
I guess, yeah.
So, 10%, I mean, yeah, it sucks that, you know, but when you hear, like, 10% normally, it's like hundreds of jobs, but 20 is not so bad.
I mean, it's not great, but, you know.
TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Machinima is shady.
You heard about the stuff about the contracts.
Oh yeah, that was in the news some time ago.
People rebelling out of the blood packs, basically.
They were signing with Machinima.
Own you forever.
I don't know why you would partner with Machinima anyways.
For a YouTube channel, it doesn't make any sense why you'd do that.
The popularity... People get blinded by the fact that people want to pay you money for doing this kind of stuff.
People just make rash decisions sometimes.
And not even... I shouldn't say that.
I make it sound like everybody who's signing a deal with a company is making a bad decision.
Maybe not necessarily.
But some people sometimes make decisions that they regret later.
Like, have you ever maybe had a job in your life where after you were there a couple months, you're like, maybe I shouldn't have taken this job.
Right?
But that's... Never.
Right?
Never, right?
No, I would never say that.
So, you know...
Anyhow, one more story before we get to the mailbag, and that is about Capcom and Mega Man.
Now, we've got this whole Street Fighter across Mega Man thing happening tomorrow, just a reminder, probably today for most of you listening to the podcast.
There's a ton more things we have in the works, according to USA Senior Vice President Christian Svensson Only some of which will be shared December 17th This is in regards to Mega Man, of course There's a whole year of things that will happen You're only going to hear about what's happening fairly close to the start of the celebrations at first So could we be getting some bombshell news about Mega Man tomorrow?
None of which will be Mega Man Legends 3 Or should I say Blue Bombshell?
so anyhow could be a big day tomorrow we'll see but at least there's that free Street Fighter Mega Man game that'll be cool I mean even if it was fan community but it's cool to Capcom and they linked up and made it happen I'll be downloading it that's for sure should we get to the mailbag?
why don't we should?
we
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and picks out a few emails to share with us on the show.
Remember though, it's only a three hour show.
We can't read every single email.
But we do read them.
And I laugh at them.
No you don't.
Well sometimes you do.
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
I'm gonna read the one that was written to you.
Yay, Commodore 64!
They had two C64s, one in a text-based adventure section and another in a computer gaming area.
I hope this doesn't make you feel as old as it made me feel.
I think I'm going to have to dig mine out of the box in my mom's basement and fire up Ultima 4 in way of the exploding fist.
You're a bastard for having one that still works.
Just saying.
The other great thing was that they had a collection of Star Wars action figures, most of which I owned at some point, but my sister sold at a garage sale when I was shipped over to Operation Desert Storm.
I never saw any of the money.
Damn her, damn her to heck.
At least she didn't sell many of my comics.
Because this is where he's pissed off.
The museum was a lot of fun, not a destination, but if you or any of your listeners happen to be in upstate New York, it's worth a side trip.
Peace, LatRatY2K, DishonoredEdgesOutOME3 and Halo4 is my GOTY.
Pac-Man!
Pac-Man!
Play Commodore 64 Oh, look at that, a Zork 2 box Good times There's a floppy hanging on the wall Good stuff Curse you for having a Commodore 64 that still works though
Next up?
Yes, next up.
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
I didn't get a chance to comment on the Fugle question of the week last week, so I decided to give my answer via email.
Oh, sorry, you're late.
Click.
No.
As a refresher, last week's question was, and I'm paraphrasing, have video games ever taught you something?
Thank you for putting that in your email, because we all would have forgotten, honestly.
Do I ever pay attention to that?
The only one I paid attention to was, what do you want for holidays?
And I'm like, Garrus.
Anyway.
My answer is, video games taught me how to gain self-confidence and make lifelong friends.
When I started playing DDR back in 1998, shut up.
I never imagined that the confidence I gained from being good at DDR would lead to me breaking out of my shell and interacting with people who treated me... Wait, why did you tell him to shut up for saying he played the game back in 98?
That's when it came out.
I know, but it was like back in 98.
14 years later, we are old as fuck.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Let me finish reading the email, Rob!
Who treated me as an equal despite my nerdy antisocial demeanor.
I wouldn't be the person I am today without video games.
I'm sure you guys and gal at OLR would tend to agree.
Thanks for letting me rant about how awesome video games are.
You guys rock.
Yours truly, AZHP.
And seriously, thank you.
Yeah, I get that too.
I learned to play drums
Speak for yourself, awkward.
No.
Last email.
That was kind of an awkward statement you just made.
I'm just saying.
Your face is awkward.
It's a little awkward in here right now.
Awkward is such a fun word, isn't it?
Because it's like got W's and K's in it.
Mm-hmm.
Talk about awkward.
That was a weird thing to say.
This is not me, but does the word awkward just look awkward?
You know what other word has W's and K's in it?
What?
Work.
But it only has one W.
Hi gang, it's your friendly neighborhood Ragenator.
I just thought I'd email a quick question just in case I don't get to call in for whatever reason.
The subject of VOG's music stream was the topic of a short discussion yesterday, Saturday, just before USL.
I think a few of us have a question directed to Rob seeing as how he's in charge of the music stream.
Will the community have the ability to donate any legally purchased music, either bought already on disc or bought via iTunes or whatever and burnt to disc?
and what would be appropriate for the feed.
I know that mainstream stuff that one would typically hear on terrestrial radio wouldn't work for obvious reasons, but I can see how game OSTs and whatnots would be doable.
I'll go ahead and say I gave Rob like...
How many DVDs worth of stuff?
um keep in mind though no major label stuff like with you know like there's some Weird Al stuff we snuck in there which but you know like we're just trying to keep the focus on indie and geek things and also do remember we don't want game soundtracks to dominate I mean obviously game sound it's it's it's gaming is part of geekery but we want it to be a balance between stuff so just you know no Lady Gaga or you know you know what I mean like let's
and DarkSakura.com.
Holiday Music on VOG
BlackWolfInChat says no mashups.
Yes and no.
I don't want to mash up with a Top 40 song.
but like there's a remix of the theme to Skyrim that's done like some type of like, I don't remember what it's called, but it's like a remix of that.
I guess you might be able to call a mashup and that's okay.
So just like as long as it's like indie stuff that's mashed together, that's fine.
So, all right.
I see that one more email just dropped in the bag.
You might want to refresh because this one's funny.
I already closed it.
Well, open it back up.
You want me to read it?
You read it.
All right, I'll read it.
one more email because I reopened the mailbag I bet it's Extifer no it's not it's Jim Sally actually oh hi Jim Sally and I only saw it because I went back into the email bag to look at those Commodore 64 pictures and I saw this from Jim Sally hey sexy host of OLR you ever use vibrating controllers for naughty purposes like tickling someone's pussy Rez
And then he signs the email, Cat, be nice for Santa this year, Jim Sally.
DarkSakura, have you ever tickled someone's pussy with a controller?
Well, Shermie used to like sitting on the controller.
Good answer.
I miss my kitty.
I need a cat in my life.
By the way, just to make an announcement, Sanrio let me pet her.
Yay.
I know, I know.
They can't hear you, Alan.
Alan just got home and he's talking about the cat.
I even got purr noises.
So, Loki, have you ever done anything naughty with a controller?
Of course none of us have done anything naughty with a controller.
I've thrown the controller at the cat to get her to stop doing something that she was doing.
My husband's crushed one in his hands several times.
Like batting.
She likes to knock stuff off the Christmas tree and stuff, so I'll throw something at her.
Sometimes it's a controller.
Oh, I get it.
Like tickling someone's pussy.
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Cat.
I get it, because that's how it was signed.
I get it.
I get it.
tickling someone's pussycat.
No, I've never done that to the cat.
The cats would not let me do that.
Alan would get very angry with me if I tried to do that.
Is Shermie one time really freaked out at the heartbeat thing in Silent Hill?
Because she was just sitting next to me while I was playing Silent Hill 3 so I put the controller on her back and she about jumped.
It was hilarious.
Good times.
By the way, Rez.
Alright, that's it for the email bag so let's get to the FUs of the week because we're so angry right now.
I feed him my hair for being in that weird in-between haircuts kind of thing.
But I've made a vow that I'm not going to cut my hair at least until my birthday.
Maybe a trim, but not like a for-reals haircut.
To see if I can stand growing out my hair for four months.
That's it.
Uh, Loki.
I feed him my brain for not wanting me to do, like, Excel work right now.
It's just like, no!
So I just can't work on this, but I'm gonna anyways.
I don't know.
It's like I've been trying to like, you know, get stuff done that I have all these projects that are kind of in the works that I just quit one and go to another one.
So I'm starting to try to wrap much of these up so I don't have a bunch of pending projects I'm working on.
So this is one of them.
My Grand Theft Auto mods that I've been working on for two years.
I'm going to give a good old-fashioned Orange Tons Radio FU to traffic, namely the traffic driving to San Francisco yesterday.
Three hours and 15 minutes for what was one hour and 40 minutes today on the way home.
Do you know what the difference was between yesterday and today?
Rain.
Because nobody knows how to drive in the fucking rain.
It's California.
So irritating.
It's like, ooh, there's a car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazard lights on.
Let's brake.
Go 70.
Brake.
Go 70.
Brake.
Ugh.
I hate you.
So yeah, that was very irritating because, you know, if we'd got to the city a little earlier, we could try to find more gay bars with pinball machines.
That's all I'm saying.
Ghost in the Shell MMO
Are they?
That sounds cool.
That's fantastic.
And I guess it's going to be a partnership between Nexon and Kodansha.
Kodansha?
Kodansha, yeah.
Is it based off of Stand Alone Complex?
It is Stand Alone Complex, and I believe it's, was it Stand Alone Complex and Stand Alone Complex Second Gig, and also the Solid State Society.
Ghost in the Shell is pretty awesome though Ghost in the Shell is pretty cool I actually liked the original Ghost in the Shell I didn't really see any of the new series
THQ Bundle
THQ's goal should be to bring entertainment to a wide audience.
Here's the quote.
So they're kind of, in a way, which is pretty fascinating for one of the bigger companies to do, they're kind of coming out and admitting, you know what we learned through this?
Maybe we are neglecting Linux.
Maybe there was enough, you know, support being buzzed out there that, you know, and especially for a company that's really struggling right now, and in some ways, you know, having an identity crisis of sorts and trying new things, you almost feel like they're kind of, like, you know, yes, it's just one pull quote or whatever,
But I do still feel like he means it much more than a lot of other people would because THQ is in a desperate situation right now.
Do you think we could see Saints Row on Linux someday?
Eh, probably not.
But what I thought the lesson he would learn is gamers hate everything.
Thanks for watching!
complicating the analysis in a positive way gamers have tweeted inventive ideas to me such as letting the community help in the porting to bring down costs THQ is committed to look at anything that makes sense I'm sure we'll have more to announce shortly community sourced porting
This is a desperate company right now.
And I hate to say it.
I know this sounds really opportunistic and like I'm dancing on their grave of sorts.
But what a great thing that's happening because of the fact that this company is struggling so bad.
I don't know.
It's just me.
Here's an idea.
Don't fucking lock System Link behind online passes.
Your game might sell a little bit better.
Seriously.
All right.
Let us move on to the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
If you want to give us a call right now and talk about whatever's on your mind, anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something we haven't yet.
In the meantime, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute news.
I'm going to pull up the Twitters here.
No, I don't because nothing's happening.
Yeah, it was kind of a slow news.
We had to stretch to fill the show tonight.
It's just like, uh, stuff.
Oh, that's okay.
I got stuff to do tomorrow.
Alright, well, we still have the Skype line open.
Call us!
I am pulling up the Twitter.
I mean, TigerClaw wanted me to mention, even though everyone's already noticed that's watched the Pacific Rim trailer, is that they have the voice of GLaDOS in there.
It's like, hey, let's get the same voice actor as GLaDOS, and then we'll just make it sound exactly like GLaDOS.
But that was a movie trailer, not a game trailer.
That was a movie trailer.
It's still awesome, though.
He tweeted that too, so I guess I can skip that one.
There you go.
Oh, we got a call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
Porkchop is gone.
Hey, Porkchop.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Just patiently waiting to see when Street Fighter Mega Man is actually available for download.
I've been refreshing the page about 100 times now.
Are you staying up all night?
Not just because of that.
I'm actually making my first game.
It's a project for college.
and I have to get it done for tomorrow, so I'm just a bit of an Asteroids clone, but that's not going very well, so I was hoping to get the game and just slack off.
Because I can tell by your accent you're probably not in the same country we are, and I know we've talked to you before.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
What time is it where you're at?
It is now 4.27 in the AM.
It's great.
I can see pretty colors on the walls and everything.
Is this normal for you?
Have a coffee.
Is this normal for you?
No, it's not.
I'm actually just really behind on work and stuff and tomorrow is the deadline, but I'd say we get an extension.
I'm not bothered.
I got to listen to all of it, so I'm happy.
Oh, what a nice thing to say.
Appreciate it.
Just to give you an idea, it's 8.30 here on the West Coast, which means it's 11.30 on the East Coast.
So best case scenario, the game will come out right after midnight on the East Coast, and that would be in about 30 minutes.
So that's your best case scenario is that the game will come out in 30 minutes.
If it's not out in 30 minutes, I couldn't tell you when it's going to come out.
Maybe another three hours when it's midnight on the West Coast.
or maybe they're going to wait until the work day starts tomorrow.
It might not really be out for you until tomorrow night.
I hate to say it.
Either way, I'm going to be awake.
I don't care.
I'm just going to waste the whole day playing it.
I'm really excited.
I guess you'll be having to get some energy drinks or whatever to stay up.
Yeah, I've just been drinking tea and eating lots of sugary things to kind of keep myself buzzed and try not to go to sleep because I want to get this finished for tomorrow at the same time.
So what is it you're studying in school?
Game Design
And that's what you want to end up ultimately doing, is doing design in the industry?
Actually, no.
It's something I wouldn't mind doing, but it's not strictly restricted.
I wouldn't mind.
Reviews and some things are good like that.
I don't mind typing stuff up.
I'm good with words, so anything at all.
I just love games.
I want to be involved.
That's it.
Um...
I suppose each company has their issues, especially EA and, you know, the whole Mass Effect thing happened way back as well.
I don't know, I mean, it doesn't bother me because there's always going to be games made.
Like, even indie gamers now are getting a really good, you know, push up there.
Like, Fez was pretty good when it was released.
You had the likes of Journey.
This guy getting an Emmy now, or sorry, a Grammy.
Was it a Grammy for the album?
Yes, Grammy.
Yeah, so he's doing pretty well.
I mean...
The media, the medium has always been pretty well respected and I think it's going to last for a long time but everybody's kind of you know they'll just hang on in there and it'll just be you know games are just going to be one of those things that just hang around like TV did.
You know, if the industry doesn't break through right away, it seems like there's a couple people in chat that might support you getting into your own podcast, radioing or something.
Extifer in chat says, this guy should have his own show.
And HitStun says, that is an awesome accent.
The girls seem to like it sometimes, but there you go.
Well, apparently some of the guys like it too, so there you go.
I don't swing that way, but very flattered, thank you very much.
So you want to get into either designing games or possibly critiquing them or something?
Yeah, something like even podcasts wouldn't bother me either.
I have a couple of friends who basically have worked and know a lot about the industry and stuff, so
You never know, we could team up and something good could come of it.
Well, don't ever expect a podcast to pay the rent.
That's all I'm going to tell you.
Of course not.
No, I'm happy to do it for fun.
You guys kind of inspired me with that as well.
You're like the first gaming podcast that I found.
And I was like, yay.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
That's an amazing compliment.
No, we love it when people... You know, you might think like we're very like, don't do your own podcast.
We don't want the freaking competition.
But that's not realistic.
Like podcasting is kind of like...
I don't know, it's kind of like ham radio in some ways, it's kind of meant for I mean, you don't have to be licensed to do a podcast but it's meant to be very open and accessible and for anybody to do them and we're very supportive of other people and like when people say, like, I was inspired to podcast because of your show, that's like the best compliment ever I think, you know, what they say, imitation is the finest form of flattery Don't forget that, you know, it does take a lot of time out of your schedule as well, so you know, respect to yourselves for like, you know
Thanks for watching!
All the way across the water as well.
Awesome.
All right, well, Porkchop, I should let you go just to see if there's anybody else who wants to call in and show off their accent as well.
But best of luck on your project.
A+.
I hope you get over your hurdle.
Thanks, guys.
Keep up the good work.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
Good night.
Bye.
Bye.
Good night.
Always good to hear.
I mean, we love the people here locally, too, like in the U.S.
I want him to read the phone book to me.
Maybe I should call him and see if he'd be willing to do new closing credits.
That would be awesome.
I should do that.
Get some of our international friends to do closing credits.
We need more bumpers.
This week's closing credits will be read by Porkchop.
And then one week it'll be this week's closing credits is read by Syl.
And then we'll have one week where this week's closing credits are read by Extifer.
Balls!
or bleached assholes.
Or trout penises.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
Going to some more tweets.
Tiger Claw tweets us an article that we haven't discussed yet.
And I actually saw this before the show, but I don't know.
It was just another like LOL Bobby Kotick story.
But since he shared it with us, I'll get into this.
Bobby Kotek kind of made a comment of sorts about the firing of Frank West and Vince Sampanella, who are now at EA.
He said that he fired them after learning that they were going to bail on their contracts to join EA.
Quote,
E.A.
I read another one, I didn't read it too closely, but there was one that was saying like, stop photoshopping my picture and giving me horns because it's really interrupting my dating life or some garbage like that.
It's like, whatever.
Let's see, some other tweets.
We had Ratchet1785 send us a tweet that says, Can't wait for the show.
I was wondering if you could mention my indie podcast I just started, the Down for Maintenance podcast.
Don't worry about it if you can't.
Oops, I guess I did name it.
I just love you guys.
I literally had the balls to make one because of you guys.
You're the inspiration.
Holy shit, that's like the second comment like that in a night.
Thank you so much.
That's amazing.
You didn't give the URL.
Where do I find the Down for Maintenance podcast?
I'll have to Google it or search for it in the iTunes stores.
But there you go.
There's your shout out and I'll check it out soon.
So congrats.
Now I'm wondering, there's a very similarly named Warcraft themed show.
Just throwing it out there.
The Realm Maintenance podcast.
Just throwing it out there.
So, but Down for Maintenance.
I wonder if that's an MMO related show then.
You need to tell me more about it.
But there's your plug.
Your early plug.
Let's see.
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype.
Orange Lodge Radio.
I saw some calls coming in, but I was mid-tweet.
So sorry, I didn't get them.
Let's see.
SSU100Matt sends a tweet.
I know you guys love your Disney, but what do you get when you mix Power Rangers and Mickey Mouse with Friends?
I don't know, what do you get when you mix all that together?
Apparently he links us to a story.
Bandai's official YouTube channel.
I thought we saw something like this previously, but the news article stated this week, so maybe it was something else.
But anyway, a teaser is up on Bandai's official YouTube channel promoting the upcoming ChoGatai King Mickey combiner set.
And this looks awesome here.
I'm going to play a little YouTube here.
This is a long YouTube.
Let's see if we can...
So yes, look at these little Mickey robots.
And then they're going to come together to form that.
That's kind of awesome.
That's a fun looking guest stop.
It's like a Mickey and a Daisy and a Donald.
Mickey meets Voltron.
Oh here, it's going through all the characters right now.
That was Mickey.
Minnie.
There's Minnie.
Is that like Disney group sex?
They look like the Vinyl Nations or something.
There's Donald.
Alright, we got calls coming in.
Let's try to take another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
Check it you, Jim Sally, Rob.
Hey, Jim Sally.
How you doing, buddy?
I'm doing pretty good.
I'm happy today.
I'm spicy.
I'm jolly.
I'm jingly.
Ho, ho, ho.
Ho, ho, ho, bitches.
I got hoes everywhere today.
Tasty Hoes.
Hey, speaking of hoes, man, I remember, I remember, no, speaking of hoes, man, you don't talk about hoes.
Listen, I remember playing Leisure Suit Larry on my fucking old 386 and remember when you got that first game and you found that prostitute and you take her to the back and you give it to her and you forgot to buy a condom and then your fucking shit falls off?
That's fucking awesome, man.
That's a life lesson I took.
I still use today, man, you know?
I think about Leisure Suit Larry and his shit falling off and I say, fuck, man, I shouldn't put something on my shit.
He's not making that up either.
That actually does happen in the first Leisure Suit Larry game.
You know what I remember?
What?
I think it was the remake, like the first remake of the first Leisure Suit Larry game, because Sierra did one.
Like the VGA one or whatever?
Yeah, like in the late, early 90s?
Yeah, the VGA version, but you had to take a quiz to prove you were 18 or over.
That's right!
Wasn't that the best?
Yes.
Oh my god, and that was before the internet, really.
Because seriously, we were all 16 and, you know, wanting to play and we were smart enough to figure out the questions.
It was like playing Jeopardy or something and it's like, instead of like winning money or something, you win boobs.
Boobs.
I don't even think they had, did they even show a boob in that game?
I can't remember.
Did they even show us a boob in that game?
I think so.
Do you remember at the end you had to give the girl an apple and she comes out of the hot tub?
Oh my god, to this day, to this day, I can't have apples in a hot tub.
I can't even remember if it was apples in a hot tub.
I suck.
I can't, man, I can't.
Well, I can, but it's not safe for children, see?
Like, you can't prove it, no.
And that's because, you know, Leisure Suit Larry was a great game, and it should be remade.
It was a game that taught me some life lessons that I needed to learn, and it's, I think, a game that should be mandatory for children to play.
But didn't you play the Leisure Suit Larry remake or whatever that was on the Xbox 360 like four years ago?
It was terrible.
Oh, it was terrible.
That was totally terrible.
Every game since the first ones were terrible.
but I do remember buying I bought one where it was love for sale I think and he was on a cruise ship and he came with a scratch and sniff book and as you play the game you can scratch and sniff shit like the lobster smelled horrible the lobster fucking smelled horrible at the bar I remember that he's not making this up like all that shit is totally true like there was a scratch and sniff edition yeah Jim Sally doesn't lie children I'm always 100% serious
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Oh my god, I played that.
So I didn't know boobs looked as good as they did until I got older.
I thought they were all pixelated and squarey and stuff until I got older.
You know what I didn't talk about last week though, but it's totally true.
There was a male version of those games too, where the person you were playing with was a man.
For, you know, all those women out there that, you know, wanted to... Or the, you know, 10% of guys that wanted to, you know, have that version.
Women love stud poker.
Did you ever play, DarkSakura, did you ever play strip poker, the male version?
No.
Did you ever play the female version?
That's fucking hot.
I played the, we're drunk as hell, we don't know what version we're playing.
Oh, that's the beginning of a hot story.
Not really, because nobody was pretty.
That's hot.
Ho, ho, ho.
It's a little different when no one's pretty.
Oh, girl, everyone's pretty when you're drunk.
No, not everyone is pretty when you're drunk.
Some of us still maintain our aesthetic sensibilities.
Hey, hey, you should grow that hair out, JB.
Don't fucking kid yourself.
Hey, look.
Normally Jim Salley is a pretty liberal guy, and I love everybody, but fuck that shit.
Girls are supposed to have long hair, and boys are supposed to have short hair.
Fuck that shit.
Grow your hair out, girl.
You deserve it.
You look so beautiful with your long hair.
Put that shit in a ponytail.
Put it in two ponytails.
Fuck it.
You deserve it.
You know what I'm saying, girl?
Grow that hair out.
Rob, shut up, man.
Cut your hair.
It's too fucking long for you, Rob.
I have no hair left.
I don't know if you've seen pictures of me.
I was just reaching back and realizing that my hair actually does not touch my shoulders remotely.
It used to be longer.
It used to be, and then I cut it all off because I was sick of it.
I just got my hair cut today.
My hair's too curly.
I got mine cut on Friday.
What's left of it?
See, the boys know what they're doing, Jamie.
Girl that shit up.
You deserve it.
She ran to the potty.
This call made her throw up.
No, I'm kidding.
Alright, Jim Sally, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but do you have any other final thoughts?
Well, before I go, I just want to say
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You're like, what the fuck?
I was just giving you attention, I was being nice, and you're just a fucking asshole.
Our cat, we put the cat on the bed, not in the bed, that's not happening, but we just put the cat on the bed to try and pet the cat.
You know what she does?
Jumps right off.
Runs away.
She's afraid of the comforter.
For real, our cat is afraid of the comforter.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura.com
and make sure you declaw your pussy.
No, don't declaw your pussy.
Declawing is the feline equivalence of ripping out someone's fingernails.
I would never declaw a cat.
I'm not Loki.
Loki declawed his cat, I bet.
Alright, Jim Sally, I gotta let you go.
Have a good one, buddy.
Okay, everyone, love your pussies tonight.
Alright, will do.
Bye.
I'm choking.
On popcorn.
Yeah.
That call made me laugh very hard.
It's always a good time when Jim Sally calls in.
All right.
Extifer is saying in the chat room that I'm plugging other podcasts, but I haven't plugged Horde House, which is the show that Extifer's on.
So there you go.
A plug for Horde House.
The best little Horde House in Azeroth, or a show we call Horde House for short, is Wednesdays premiering on the VOG Network.
11 a.m.
Pacific, 2 p.m.
Eastern is the premiere, and then it's up on the podcast feed Wednesday nights at HordeHouse.com.
or of course, VOGnetwork.com if you're reloading it obsessively throughout the week then you'll see it posted on Wednesday nights alright I think that was it for tweets tonight too, I think I got them all that's that that's it for tweets nobody else is calling in
I think that's it for the show.
We're done a little early tonight, but you know what?
It's a slower news week.
DarkSakura has an appointment in the morning she wants to keep, so we're going to end it up early a little bit tonight.
Yeah.
So that's it.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we say goodnight.
Loki, why don't you start us off with your final thought?
People need to come play on the Minecraft server.
Yes, I know that I can set up a day to have everybody come play, but seriously, there's like zero people on there other than me.
I checked the logs.
I know there's like nobody playing.
And I'm sure partly what that problem was because one day I left the server off because I was messing with something and forgot to turn it back on.
And...
The permissions were screwed up for a while there.
But they're all fixed now.
They're pretty much fixed.
And the mob arena works okay.
It's still really hard.
Even though I tried tweaking things to make it work better.
Apparently that classic bow plugin does not work.
I come to find out.
But I made it so you can spam fireballs now.
And that's kind of fun.
You still get your ass kicked though.
Even though you're throwing tons of fireballs at everything.
Those enemies are relentless.
And they will just come for you.
All right.
And my final thoughts since I'm being yelled at in chat about it.
You know what?
I'm just going to say this.
Support all indie podcasting.
Support them all.
Indie podcasts rock.
And a lot of people work very hard for very little money to make podcasts work.
And especially, may I call your attention to all the shows that are a part of the VOG Network.
We have a great lineup of shows from... Including...
including Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wow, Horde House, and yes, Bobby Blackwolf.
And Under Station Live, don't forget them.
And Jamie Eats Raw Popcorn, the podcast.
You know, I don't remember, I don't think you've produced five episodes of that yet.
Nom, nom, nom, nom.
All right.
Did I get your final thought, DarkSakura?
No.
I don't think we have yet.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Candy Cane JoJo's.
Mojo Jojo's?
No.
Jojo's.
Alright.
So as I said, support indie podcasting.

We'll see.
So, um, for now, we'll be back next week to do it all again.
