0	17400	DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, December 30th, 2012, one console
17400	18760	ends production.
18760	21660	Could adult movies really soon be on the Wii U?
21660	31820	Can we look back at the best and worst of 2012?
31820	35900	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35900	37940	where every gamer has a voice.
37940	47280	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 487 for this December the 30th of 2012.
47280	50480	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about
50480	55840	video games, video gaming, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, gamer, we haven't
55840	57780	thought of it yet, with my co-hosts.
57780	59240	Say hello to DarkSakura.
59240	60240	Hi.
60240	63000	How are you DarkSakura?
63000	64000	Caffeinated.
64000	66520	Or Jamie Summers, depending on how people want to call you.
66520	67520	Or awesome.
67520	69560	Or awesome, Miss Awesome, Queen of Awesome.
69560	70560	Yes, that's right.
70560	72440	You excited for New Year's Eve?
72440	73440	I guess.
73440	74440	Big plans?
74440	75440	No.
75440	80160	Okay, Dan's gonna have the relatives over and my plan is to be playing Mass Effect from
80160	83440	the New Year rolls in and drinking, which are my two resolutions.
83440	87200	I was just gonna say, you made a Facebook post the other day with your New Year's resolutions.
87200	89320	My New Year's resolutions, actually I had four things.
89320	95080	I think it was to drink more, to play more Mass Effect, to play more WoW, which actually
95080	98600	I have been slacking, and to do more art.
98600	102020	Usually you don't see people resolve to play more video games, you see people resolve to
102020	103020	play less.
103020	104020	I need to play more video games.
104020	105020	I've been slacking.
105020	106020	You need to play more variety of video games.
106020	108840	I need to play more games that I've actually bought on Steam.
108840	109840	There you go.
110520	113840	I just bought Limbo, because it's on sale and it looks really neat.
113840	114840	Who doesn't love a sale?
114840	119240	I've been getting really kind of artsy fartsy games and then I went out and bought Dr. Robotnik's
119240	120240	Mean Bean Machine.
120240	121240	Why not?
121240	122240	So, more on that later.
122240	123720	You mean Kirby's Avalanche?
123720	125560	No, puyo puyo.
125560	128560	Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
128560	129560	Hi.
129560	130560	How are you, Loki?
130560	131560	I'm doing alright.
131560	132560	Yeah?
132560	133560	Yeah.
133560	134560	What's new with you?
134560	135560	Not much.
135560	139720	I mean, just watching a video of Grand Theft Auto.
140480	142240	Even when you're not playing it, you're thinking about it.
142240	143240	It's cool.
143240	144720	Yeah, I am.
144720	148520	I noticed that you brought pizza with you to the show tonight.
148520	150960	The last OLR of 2012, by the way.
150960	154480	Actually the last live VoG network show of 2012.
154480	158600	Not the last VoG show of 2012, because we do have taped programming tomorrow, but the
158600	160880	last live show of 2012 tonight.
160880	163560	So you brought pizza and you said it's Pepperoni 4.0?
163560	167220	They call it, it's Round Table's Pepperoni 4.0.
167220	171640	It's not very good, because they're like, oh hey, we're gonna put a bunch of pepperoni
171640	172640	on there.
172640	176780	Yeah, I thought it'd be a lot of pepperoni, but it's just like, really the thing that
176780	178420	ruins it is their primo pepperoni.
178420	182420	It's the one that's like, it looks like salami, and it kind of tastes like salami.
182420	183420	Maybe it is salami.
183420	189780	It's not salami, but it tastes sort of, it's either saltier and spicier, and it just kind
189780	190780	of tastes off.
190780	192380	The rest of them taste pretty good.
192380	197060	But they have like these, I don't know, it's almost like the full currency of pepperonis.
197060	202260	They have the salami shaped pepperonis, they have the smaller, regular sized pepperonis,
202260	207220	they have the pepperonis you would find at like, was it Papa Murphy's or whatever, or
207220	208220	uh...
208220	212540	Honestly, Loki, I look at that and I go, I want a veggie.
212540	216380	And then they have tiny pepperonis that are like, the size of, I don't know what.
216380	217860	It's just super tiny.
217860	222740	We're always joined by the fourth guest on our show, the chat room at live.vognetwork.com,
222740	226180	where we do tape live every Sunday night, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
226180	227740	But not tonight, he was off.
227740	230940	He plays in the drum line for the Atlanta Falcons, and they had the late game today.
230940	232800	So he was off tonight.
232800	234820	But we do have the chatters with us tonight.
234820	240820	Frisbee starts us off tonight on Loki's Pizza, saying it's pep for Roni.
240820	242820	Alright.
242820	250860	Well, we do have another guest with us tonight live in studio, a makeup visit, if you will.
250860	256460	Say hello, everybody, to the VOG leaderboard, undoubtable winner for the whole damn year.
256460	259760	I don't know, the month's not over yet, a lot can happen in a couple days, but for the
259760	260860	whole year, I'm sure.
260860	262620	Say hello, everybody, to Flaco Jones.
262620	263620	Hi, everybody.
263620	264620	Hi, Flaco.
264620	265620	How are you?
265620	266620	I'm doing great.
266620	267620	Yeah?
267620	268620	What's new?
268620	269620	Tiger Claw has more points.
269620	273420	If you just take points for the whole year, I'm pretty sure he's got the most points.
273420	274420	Oh, really?
274420	275420	Oh, then maybe.
275420	277460	But a number of times on the leaderboard, then yes, that's me.
277460	279540	Bobby has to figure all that shit out in the next couple days.
279540	285420	I don't envy him for that, but nevertheless, a great showing on the VOG network leaderboards
285420	286420	this year.
286420	287780	So thanks for playing.
287780	289260	Thank you.
289260	290260	I'm the winner.
290260	291260	Yes.
291260	294420	So you get to come on the show tonight and just glow.
294420	295420	That's my prize.
295420	296660	A winner is you.
296660	297660	Congratulations.
297660	301700	Well, maybe we'll get like Tiger Claw to call in or somebody else to call in at the end
301700	303380	of the show and do a little gloating.
303380	306780	I want to hear from Immortal King too, because he's been neck and neck with you the past
306780	307780	couple months.
307780	308780	Yeah.
309020	310260	He's got a point head start right at the beginning.
310260	313380	Well, he's he figured out how to play the system.
313380	314380	That's right.
314380	315380	So good for him.
315380	318660	He gets he gets I should give him a special piece of loot for that or something just to
318660	323540	give him enough points to beat you like a bank, like a piggy bank banked all these podcast
323540	324540	points from last month.
324540	325540	Exactly.
325540	326540	That'd be a great trophy.
326540	328660	Well, welcome back to the show.
328660	330260	For those that don't know, here's the deal.
330260	332780	Flaco Jones joined us for a show earlier this year.
332780	334020	I want to say it was around June, right?
334020	335020	It was in May.
335020	336020	It was in May.
336020	337020	Yeah.
337020	338020	Close enough.
338260	339260	Back in May.
339260	341860	And we were doing the show and we got to the classic game of the week, which is always
341860	344640	right at the end of part A. Right.
344640	346460	And that's right when the power went out.
346460	348660	Oh, right in the middle of me talking.
348660	353380	That is a killer for the show, because what happens is then then we lose the recorded
353380	354380	archive.
354380	355380	And so there was no podcast that week.
355380	356980	So it ended up being a live only show.
356980	358980	And we kept saying after that, we got to get Flaco back.
358980	359980	We got to get Flaco back.
359980	360980	Flaco's back.
360980	361980	Yeah, I'm back.
361980	364500	Well, the problem was I moved in June.
364500	366660	I moved away from Sacramento.
366660	368460	So I live like an hour away now.
368460	370180	So that was what made it so hard to get back.
370180	372100	You drove an hour all the way just to be here tonight.
372100	375820	Well, I had really good traffic, so I actually drove like 45 minutes.
375820	376820	Maybe you sped a little bit.
376820	377820	A little bit.
377820	378820	But nobody got me.
378820	379820	All right.
379820	381820	So I want to talk to you a little bit about like you and the types of games you play and
381820	383900	all that stuff.
383900	385220	What kind of video games are you into?
385220	386580	What kind of gamer are you?
386580	387580	Console gamer?
387580	388580	PC gamer?
388580	389580	MMO player?
389580	390580	I'm a console gamer.
390580	395180	I mean, I do play some stuff on PC and I do like WoW a lot, but I still consider myself
395180	396180	mainly a console gamer.
396700	402100	Those are the games I prefer and I tend to like games that have a really good story.
402100	405060	Gameplay still got to be good, but if the story is good enough, if it's really, really
405060	411060	good, I can kind of sometimes forego some gameplay elements and I just go for story
411060	415180	games because I went to film school to be a screenwriter and so I'm all sucked up in
415180	418660	the story and I love games like Bioshock and I love RPGs because they always have really
418660	420340	good, really deep story.
420340	425060	So you must be really into Walking Dead these days because that's a game that's got to go.
425060	429340	I finally, we'll get into gaming weeks later, but I finally got exposed to Walking Dead
429340	431860	this past week and very well written game.
431860	432860	Yeah, yeah.
432860	433860	I was waiting on that.
433860	435460	I bought that one just a couple weeks ago.
435460	438820	I was waiting until it all had come out and I heard they did a good job.
438820	441940	I want to make sure they did a good job before I bought it because that started coming out
441940	446180	I think in April or something and I wasn't willing to just buy that now and then hope
446180	449100	that the rest would come out and still be good or anything like that.
449100	453420	So I waited until the whole thing came out and I bought the season pass even though the
453420	456740	season's over, but they still gave it the $5 off, you know, one of the games.
456740	460620	Well, there was a great sale on Xbox this week where all the, you know, they were given
460620	464620	away episode one for free and then all the episodes like two days ago, two through five
464620	465820	were only 200 points each.
465820	468460	So you can get the whole thing for like 10 bucks.
468460	470180	So I was like, yoink, thank you.
470180	471380	I'll be taking care of that.
471380	473420	So I had to play $20.
473420	478780	I have to play episodes two through five still at some point, but you know, that's all right.
478780	480940	Telltale has done a lot of great stuff the past couple of years.
480940	485180	I mean, they're only game that was kind of, and was Jurassic park, but a lot of the, I
485180	489580	mean, even then, I mean, I haven't played it, so I'm really going off of what I hear
489580	492900	on the internet, but even then Jurassic park has its people that are like, it's not as
492900	494300	bad as you guys make it out to be.
494300	495300	Thanks, Rob.
495300	496300	Now that song is stuck in my head again.
496300	498180	Jurassic park is frightened.
498180	499180	Yeah.
499180	503300	Or the actual theme song, Jurassic park, the weird Al one or whatever.
503300	504300	All right.
504300	507700	Um, let's see what else you used to work in the video game industry, right?
507700	508700	Yeah.
508700	509700	I was a video game tester.
509700	511260	You were the tester.
511260	512260	I was the tester.
512260	514660	Oh, wait, no, not, not actually didn't know.
514660	515660	I did.
515660	517320	I did a play test for Sony as well.
517320	522300	They had us come in and do a play test for, Oh gosh, I can't remember the game now.
522300	527220	It was like maybe one of the Jack and Daxter games, like a multiplayer play test and that's
527220	528220	kind of what got me into it.
528220	531460	They put a Craigslist, Craigslist posting was like, come and do this play test.
531460	536060	We'll pay you 80 bucks and you get to just play the game multiplayer and it was more
536060	538420	of like a focus group testing thing.
538420	540220	And I did that and I was like, that was really fun.
540220	545340	So I started looking up a video game testing job opportunities and I found Konami and I
545340	548580	went and interviewed and I thought I did a horrible interview and I went home and they
548580	551580	called me back and said, you got the job.
551580	553660	Well seeing how Konami has been doing the past couple of years.
553660	554940	No, but this was just a while ago.
554940	557740	This is when Konami was doing a lot of really quality stuff, right?
557740	561900	Well, they were still, I mean, they still had metal gear stuff, but the stuff I, you
561900	565660	know, you were there during the period of a lot of, and this is all common knowledge
565660	566660	at this point.
566660	567660	I don't think there's any secrets anymore.
567660	570260	You were in the office that is since closed, right?
570260	571260	Redwood Shores, I believe.
571260	573700	But you were out of there before that happened, right?
573700	576640	Just before they moved to LA, but everyone knew they were leaving.
576640	581220	But like, you know, you were there when Shane was there and like Mel B was there and a lot
581220	587120	of the people that did the Xbox DDR, uh, series, the ultra mix that did a lot of the step programming
587120	588120	and testing and so forth for that.
588120	590100	But you were really involved with the DDR stuff.
590100	591300	No, I didn't do DDR stuff.
591300	592300	I did.
592300	596620	I did a lot of karaoke revolution and Frogger was the first game I worked on.
596620	602020	It was like the Frogger DS game and there was like a Frogger, screw you, screw you for
602020	603020	all of that.
603020	604620	You should have told him this sucks.
604620	605620	Don't put it on.
605620	606620	Just let it die.
606620	607620	Let it die.
607620	611580	You know, I prefer to work on those games other than what they started cranking out
611580	615100	while I was there, which were really crappy licensed games where they would get licensed
615100	617740	off of Saturday morning cartoons and do that.
617740	625340	And I was like the head man for some reason because I took it with such a gosh, such enthusiasm.
625340	628100	I became the winks club guy.
628100	631580	It was a very small game, so they only needed like one or two people to work on it at a
631580	632580	time.
632580	636140	So I was the, the expert in all things winks and I, I took it and I was like, I'm going
636140	637140	to roll with this.
637140	642300	I watched, I watched the first season of the show and I was writing up bugs about continuity
642300	643300	problems.
643300	649020	It's like, Oh no, she wouldn't say that before she went on her first date with sky because
649020	650020	you know what though?
650020	651020	Here's the thing.
651020	652260	As much as I want to sit here and make fun of you.
652260	656220	How ironic is it now though that like my little pony is the coolest show on TV.
656220	662380	So like you were like hipster, you're watching little girl TV shows before it was cool and
662380	663940	you weren't even smoking weed.
663940	664940	Right?
664940	665940	Yeah.
665940	666940	Except my little pony still isn't cool.
666940	668820	It was only cool in the eighties.
668820	671860	You can address those cards and letters to dark soccer.
671860	675580	I have kids now and I was watching Nickelodeon the other day and the winks club is on Nickelodeon
675580	679740	now and it's all computer and it looks weird and the voices are all different.
679740	682100	There was a British chick on that show and now she's not British.
682100	684740	She's just another purple haired girl.
684740	686660	And now they have another winks game.
686660	687660	I'm there.
687660	688660	Is it another Konami winks game?
688660	689660	No, it's not Konami anymore.
689660	690660	It's d three.
690660	692220	Oh, Konami lost the license.
692220	693220	Sorry guys.
693220	698820	Ironically though, ironically though, the guy that was my Konami rep at the time who
698820	703460	was selling the winks game is now working for d three selling the winks game.
703460	704460	This is hilarious.
704460	705460	Oh God.
705460	709900	That's, that's even worse than like Flaco is like Flaco just kind of got assigned to
709900	710900	it yet.
710900	712660	This guy has like been following it, right?
712660	716900	Well for him, he said it was, it was all right cause he's all, we've sold these in the past.
716900	717900	He's all I know.
717900	720380	I know about this franchise cause I had to sell it before.
720380	723820	So Konami made a lot of winks games.
723820	725100	I assume they were selling.
725100	728060	That's kind of like one of the guys I worked under over there.
728060	732300	He was like, you know, it's kind of a, that's, that's where the industry, or at least where
732300	738820	Konami was going was like, why put a bunch of money into a new IP that might not sell
738820	743140	if you can just buy a license and the parents are going to walk in, dig well, toys or us
743140	744700	and buy that game for their kid.
744700	745700	Cause like, Oh my kid watches that show.
745700	746700	I'll just buy it.
746700	747700	And they don't even care about the game.
747700	749100	That's a lot of what kind of goes on in the industry.
749100	750100	Heck yeah.
750100	751940	I mean it's for better or for worse.
751940	752940	I mean, yeah.
752940	757900	You know, the walking dead again, terrific game that happens to be based on a license.
757900	761300	It worked in that scenario, although I want to say, isn't there like a first person shooter
761300	764700	game as well, but it's like, there's one activisions put one out, but let me say it's not out yet.
764700	766820	The bar, not very high for that one.
766820	768340	And I'm worried that people are going to get confused.
768340	771860	The walking dead game from tell tales based on the comic.
771860	775520	The first procedure is going to be based on the show, which is based on the comic.
775520	777740	So it's like, it kind of dilutes itself a little bit.
777740	788260	So let me ask you something, Jim, does, do songs like this give you PTSD?
788260	791460	That was, I feel worse.
791460	792460	Of course.
792460	793460	Well, you know, I didn't hear that.
793460	794460	I didn't hear that.
794460	797140	I didn't catch the beginning when I was watching Nickelodeon, but I feel worse for the people
797140	802060	that worked at E3 and I had to work right next to the Winx booth because that song played
802060	803060	on a loop all the time.
803060	807780	At least when I did E3, I had to do, I got to showcase Pro Evolution, whatever it's called
807780	812660	soccer, a manly soccer, winning 11, 11 at the time, but I think they were dropping the
812660	816460	winning 11 title cause it sounded really stupid with 11 behind it.
816460	822300	But yeah, that song played on a loop like crazy change in chat, uh, saying, Jim, remember
822300	825380	when we worked on the PS2 PC one, that wasn't so bad to play.
825380	826420	No, I have that game.
826420	827660	I still have that.
827660	830300	I got, uh, are you going to show your kids someday?
830300	831300	I will.
831300	834720	You know, I, I have it on, I have a little emulator on my phone and I have the Game Boy
834720	839300	version on that and I've showed my kids that, that version.
839300	841520	And uh, even my son doesn't, doesn't mind it.
841520	842520	He likes it.
842520	846700	You press, if you press and hold the X button, Bloom charges up her flame attack and it shoots
846700	848620	out and it's like a pretty animation.
848620	849740	So my son likes that.
849740	851540	But yeah, I have the PC version.
851540	855220	I think I tried to show it to a bunch of friends and they were like, this is horrible.
855220	858780	But the PC version actually, out of all the games we played, that was the best one at
858780	859780	all the winks games.
859780	861620	It was the most like a game.
861620	865300	And then later on they just started making mini game collections with that were horrible.
865300	866300	Hmm.
866300	867300	Yeah, really bad.
867300	870340	But the first couple of games, they actually tried to make real games and then like, Oh,
870340	871340	we don't need to do that.
871340	872420	Let's, let's save even more money.
872420	873940	Just make mini games.
873940	876140	All right.
876140	879640	I guess some of our live was that you, you carry a curse with you apparently Flaco because
879640	882180	you know you shut off the power that one time.
882180	884580	Apparently some of our live listeners are getting dropped right now.
884580	885580	I don't know what's up.
885580	886580	But that hasn't happened for a while.
886580	888340	It hasn't happened ever since we got the new router at home.
888340	890260	So turn off your porn horns, everybody.
890260	892100	Um, it's cause I brought two mobile devices.
892100	895660	Well, also I want to point out, we're showing, I'm showing that the feed is still going and
895660	900100	we haven't had, usually if we have a big drop, I see it, it goes disconnect, dah, dah, dah,
900100	901100	dah.
901100	902380	And like, but we're, we're okay for right now.
902380	903380	So we'll see.
903380	904380	All right.
904380	905380	Um, anyhow.
905380	908860	Oh, now there it goes.
908860	910700	There's the reconnect.
910700	911700	Good times.
911700	912700	Live radio.
912700	913700	What can you do?
913980	916500	We are going to press forward best we can.
916500	920660	So no one ever gets to hear me tell my story, but no, you only have it on the podcast.
920660	921660	No, that's good.
921660	922660	Damn you.
922660	923660	Konami.
923660	924660	I think they're the ones shutting me down.
924660	925660	Like, Oh, he's talking about the wings.
925660	926660	Turn it off.
926660	927660	Turn it off.
927660	929660	Do you think they're DDoSing us right now?
929660	930660	Yes.
930660	931660	All right.
931660	938200	Let me tell the chatters to calm down and twist your panties, everybody.
938200	939200	The world is fine.
939200	940200	All right.
940720	943960	Anyhow, barring a power outage, which you never know might happen.
943960	944960	All right.
944960	947040	Um, so you did the testing stuff for a while.
947040	948440	You did the wing, she and Frogger.
948440	949440	You didn't do DDR, but okay.
949440	952760	You did some of this cool stuff, a little metal gear, but you, you don't do game industry
952760	953760	stuff anymore.
953760	954760	Right?
954760	955760	No, no.
955760	959760	I got, I got out of that and when I graduated film school and, but instead of running to
959760	965660	Hollywood and doing that, I, I met a girl and I moved to Sacramento and, and I got an
965660	969360	awesome job at a school up here and I'm doing TV stuff, which is, which is great.
969360	973880	And it's so much better than the, Oh my gosh, I hope I survive plan that I thought I was
973880	974880	going to have college.
974880	979180	Like, let's go to Hollywood and try not to get killed and make movies.
979180	982640	And in this whole very interesting, it's a small world type of thing.
982640	984880	You married extra verse sister from Hoard House.
984880	985880	Extra from Hoard House.
985880	986880	I married.
986880	990960	So he's my brother-in-law, the guy who comes on here and talks about, you know, all sorts
990960	992000	of nasty stuff.
992000	993000	That's awesome though.
993000	994000	Bleached assholes.
994000	995000	Yes.
995000	996000	There we go.
996000	999340	Who doesn't do any of that, like in real life around like, especially like family
999340	1000340	Oh no.
1000340	1001340	Yeah.
1001340	1002340	Yeah.
1002340	1003340	Never.
1003340	1004340	Never.
1004340	1005340	That's why he gets it out.
1005340	1007780	He has Tourette's, but it only takes place when he's doing a podcast.
1007780	1010100	Well, that's not, that's not true.
1010100	1012600	Usually when he's hanging out with friends too, but, uh, or when he's at a theme park
1012600	1014060	on a roller coaster.
1014060	1015060	Yeah.
1015060	1018260	So, so the game testing stuff for you was just kind of like a bridge from one thing
1018260	1019260	to another, right?
1019260	1020940	It was a college job really.
1020940	1025420	I was not the kind of guy who could go to school and not work because I had to pay for
1025420	1026420	my rent and everything.
1026420	1027720	I didn't have a ton of financial aid.
1027720	1030240	So I had to have a full time job.
1030240	1031240	So it was crazy.
1031240	1034280	Cause I lived in, well, it's kind of confusing to say this to people who don't know, but
1034280	1039400	I lived in Concord and I worked in Redwood city and I went to school in San Francisco
1039400	1044320	side on Thursdays, especially I do this like triangle of doom where I took, where I took
1044320	1048120	Bart to Caltrain and went all the way down to Redwood city.
1048120	1051200	It was like hours on, on commuting just to go back and forth.
1051200	1056520	I wouldn't, I'd leave the house at like six in the morning and get home at, at 11 o'clock
1056520	1057520	at night.
1057520	1058520	I had to do that to make ends meet.
1058520	1062520	It sounds like Konami worked out a lot better for you than like Burger King, which some
1062520	1063520	people have to do, right?
1063520	1066160	Oh, I used to move TVs for the good guys and that was horrible.
1066160	1069920	I hurt my back a couple of times and Konami paid better and I just got to sit on my butt
1069920	1070920	and play video games.
1070920	1071920	Gotcha.
1071920	1072920	All right.
1072920	1075920	Well, people do what they got to do.
1075920	1081220	Let me ask this, what, what kind of like, are there any like really funny stories about
1081220	1085240	like what might've happened, like going into your favorite game, like, like crazy testing
1085240	1089120	behind the scenes story, like, you know, not safe for work type things.
1089120	1094120	Gosh, I don't want to like throw anybody in the bus.
1094120	1096060	Don't say their name.
1096060	1102160	Some people, you know, if, unless it was Shane, that might all mean say his name.
1102160	1105580	We would, we would, it was, it was a nice, relaxed like workplace.
1105580	1109500	It wasn't, I heard Sony was like a, was like a sweat shop, but I don't know, I didn't really
1109500	1112960	work there, but I heard it was like a sweat shop and it wasn't fun, but we would go out
1112960	1118400	on lunch and we'd get some drinks and we'd come back and it's like, oh, it's post-lunch
1118400	1124720	nap time and look at all these DDR pads make wonderful blankets and you know, just stuff
1124720	1125720	like that.
1125720	1129240	But you know, I'm drinking with my boss, I guess that sounds bad.
1129240	1133160	So they're drinking then like, well, it's not bad if I drink on the job kind of or at
1133160	1134320	lunch break.
1134320	1137980	So yeah, we would come back and, but we, we always got our work done.
1137980	1138980	That's all that matters, right?
1138980	1142040	And some jobs allow you to drink technically on the job, like especially if you are the
1142040	1143880	type of person that entertains clients.
1143880	1144880	Yeah.
1144880	1147800	Well, I assume it wasn't like a prostitute.
1147800	1152440	I just assume because my superiors do it, that it wasn't against Konami's rules, so
1152440	1156920	I was going to be blissfully, you know, technically we're all temps anyway, so.
1156920	1158360	Were there any girls?
1158360	1159360	There were a couple of girls.
1159360	1160360	Yeah, yeah.
1160360	1161360	That's good.
1161360	1164160	Some of them I still, I still, I still know like Facebook friends with and Twitter friends
1164160	1165280	and whatnot.
1165280	1166920	Was it kind of a fraternity environment?
1166920	1168320	That's what I hear about some testing things.
1168320	1171680	I mean, even though it was, there were girls too, you know, they're, they're, they're just
1171720	1172720	some of the bros too.
1172720	1173720	Right.
1173720	1174720	Yeah.
1174720	1175720	I guess a little bit.
1175720	1176720	It wasn't, I don't think it was too crazy there.
1176720	1180040	Like, I don't know, maybe I hung out with the wrong crowd, but you know, I had friends
1180040	1183640	who were girls, friends who were gay, and it didn't seem like it was too much of like
1183640	1184640	a frat house.
1184640	1188140	Well, I don't mean necessarily like, I didn't know if it was like that company you talked
1188140	1190800	about a couple of weeks ago where they had strippers at their holiday party.
1190800	1191800	It wasn't like that.
1191800	1194520	That's a holiday party.
1194520	1195520	That's for the best.
1195520	1196520	I don't know.
1196520	1197520	I mean, I don't know.
1197520	1201240	I mean, it was definitely like a fun like place to work, but it wasn't a total, like,
1201280	1204280	I mean, yeah, it was, it was a lot of guys there, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like
1204280	1206280	that Adam Sandler mama's boy movie.
1206280	1207280	We weren't all like that.
1207280	1211120	I just want to say you told me a story one time and I don't remember if it was on the
1211120	1212120	show or not on the show.
1212120	1215120	Maybe this was even you about some guy who came to work with no pants on or something.
1215120	1216480	Oh, that was not me.
1216480	1217480	So I don't know.
1217480	1221520	We did have a guy who come to work and I had a friend who worked there and he noticed this
1221520	1224060	and he had to tell me, he's like, we had a guy who came to work.
1224060	1227800	He wore like just a white undershirt basically for a shirt.
1228440	1229600	My friend would tap me on the shoulder.
1229600	1234020	He's like, I hate it when he wears that shirt cause all I can stare at are his big, dark
1234020	1237880	Asian nipples.
1237880	1247040	I wish you would put a darker shirt on cause I hate staring at his big, dark Asian nipples.
1247040	1250360	So yeah, but I don't know about anyone who came to work without any pants on.
1250360	1254320	See, once again, I was probably not hanging out with the right crowd.
1254320	1259760	Shane is yelling out in chat who it was, but since I don't want to, I got to be careful.
1259760	1260760	Are you in the chat room?
1260760	1261760	Okay.
1261760	1262760	Yeah, I am now.
1262760	1263760	I guess I wasn't.
1263760	1264760	Okay.
1264760	1265760	Oh, he was the one.
1265760	1266760	See, I missed that one.
1266760	1268320	I must not have been there.
1268320	1269920	I got laid off for a couple months too.
1269920	1271480	Shane that told me that story.
1271480	1272480	Oops.
1272480	1273480	All right.
1273480	1276000	You have a question from the chatters and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and all
1276000	1277000	that.
1277000	1280680	Tiger Claw asks, during your time as a tester, did the company make you do some testing that
1280680	1281680	was out of the ordinary?
1281680	1283640	I'm not sure how to take that question.
1284520	1287680	You know what, one thing that they asked me to do that was kind of cool actually was I
1287680	1294120	got to take a, a dev kit home because we had to test Metal Gear online and they wanted
1294120	1297600	to test it with different people's different service providers and stuff like that.
1297600	1298600	And so it was a big deal.
1298600	1299600	I signed a bunch of paperwork.
1299600	1301600	Maybe I shouldn't talk about it, but whatever.
1301600	1305520	I signed a bunch of paperwork and take the system home and actually got to test Metal
1305520	1310760	Gear 3 online from home and that was really fun and like no one's supposed to be there.
1310760	1311760	Of course, my roommate was right there.
1311880	1312880	He's like, Oh, this is awesome.
1312880	1313880	Like quiet.
1313880	1314880	Yeah.
1314880	1315880	Exactly.
1315880	1319480	We get on a conference call and we would all talk and then we were playing with the Japanese
1319480	1320480	play testers too.
1320480	1322880	And they were like just murdering us cause they'd already gotten to test the game.
1322880	1325280	We were just testing online functionality really.
1325280	1327120	They'd already tested it over in Japan.
1327120	1329360	We didn't get the triple A titles in Redwood City.
1329360	1332000	Usually it was those like Metal Gear stuff that was done in Japan.
1332000	1333000	That's not so secretive.
1333000	1334000	That's not that bad.
1334000	1337760	At the time they, you know, people want to know everything about a game like that and
1337760	1338760	yeah, you gotta be careful.
1338760	1342960	I don't remember ever being like told to test something like in some weird way.
1342960	1343960	I don't know.
1343960	1344960	But yeah, it was just, just taking it home.
1344960	1345960	That was kind of cool.
1345960	1348600	But it was, I didn't expect to ever have to be able to do testing at home.
1348600	1352280	Raginator says paternity testing would be testing is out of the ordinary.
1352280	1353280	He's not on the Maury show.
1353280	1354280	Raginator.
1354280	1355280	Yeah.
1355280	1356280	I didn't have to do any of that.
1356280	1359980	I'm trying to think cause the only one story that always sticks out with me is just because
1359980	1364680	the game was so terrible was that 25 to life and how like, you know, bad that game was
1364680	1365680	or whatever.
1365680	1367920	And you were telling me, Oh my gosh, that's right.
1367920	1368920	Crime life.
1368920	1369920	I think it was crime life.
1369920	1370920	I'm sorry.
1370920	1371920	Yeah, that was a game.
1371920	1374600	I didn't test it, but in the downtime when I didn't get laid off the next time there
1374600	1378500	was downtime, they, they kind of have you just test games that are already out and really
1378500	1382960	buggy or they just, they just have old builds of and so to keep our skills, you know, kind
1382960	1383960	of tight.
1383960	1387760	And they would, they, so crime life was a game where if it was, it was a grand theft
1387760	1391800	out of rip off I guess, but you could throw like every box into this one room and then
1391800	1395280	trigger a cut scene and the guys are like, they get stuck trying to walk through like
1395280	1396280	a million boxes.
1396480	1399360	So we, we bug that game and that game was so bad.
1399360	1400360	Like I don't think it was ever released.
1400360	1401360	I think it was just released in Europe.
1401360	1406400	Uh, no, it came out of an Xbox Xbox, but yeah, it was very, I don't know anything about that
1406400	1407400	game.
1407400	1408400	I just know it was terrible.
1408400	1411380	You know, despite all these, you know, extreme stories we're telling and so forth, you seem
1411380	1413760	very like positive and happy about the whole experience.
1413760	1417520	Would you say that, you know, you had a good experience and doing that whole thing and
1417520	1419360	yeah, that was one of my favorite jobs I've ever had.
1419360	1422800	Like the favorite, my favorite, I guess odd job that I've ever had.
1422800	1425400	Like we like that I had to go through to get myself through college.
1425400	1428360	It was the bad and I worked there for like two years because a lot of people are always
1428360	1429360	like, Oh, game testing.
1429360	1432520	You have to, you have to play the same game for eight hours a day and it's not all the
1432520	1433520	glamour you think.
1433520	1438300	Well, I think like game testing wire, like, you know, it's like a similar, not really
1438300	1442440	a first job or, but a very early job, not like something like I wouldn't go right now.
1442440	1446640	Hey, I'm going to become a game tester to pay my way through my mortgage and stuff.
1446640	1447640	That's not going to happen.
1447640	1448640	It's just stupid.
1448640	1453240	However, my friend pays his bills by being a video game, a strategy guide writer.
1453240	1454760	Hey, yeah, whatever it is.
1454760	1456120	They wrote the one for Mass Effect three.
1456120	1458840	He says he can't play that game anymore.
1458840	1463560	So yeah, there's a lot, there's a lot of like playing the same game, but it's just how you
1463560	1464560	deal with that.
1464560	1467600	And if you just have fun with it, like I, like I said, I had fun with the winks.
1467600	1472080	I was put on this game that you had a positive attitude about, like I get to be lead tester
1472080	1473240	even if it's the winks.
1473240	1474240	I don't care.
1474240	1475240	Yeah.
1475240	1477080	If you don't have a positive attitude, then yeah, that job could be horrible because you
1477080	1480920	could just be like, Oh, I'm playing Frogger and this is something I had to do in Frogger
1480920	1481920	that was kind of annoying.
1481920	1486000	And maybe this goes back to that question Tigerclaw had was they're like, we're, we
1486000	1492680	have all this time to test still now use the jump on every tile in the game.
1492680	1497520	So every square, like every tiny little piece that you could jump on, just jump on it and
1497520	1499020	see if you don't fall through the world.
1499020	1502040	And it was so annoying because it wasn't just stuff you would normally go through.
1502040	1505760	It was like, Oh, now use this cheat code to fly over the water and make sure that you
1505760	1506760	die in the water.
1506760	1508680	It's like, but over there I can't get there anyway.
1508680	1509680	What's the point?
1509680	1510800	So it was like, why am I?
1510800	1512280	So that, that got annoying after a while.
1512280	1514240	I was like, okay, I think we've tested this game enough.
1514240	1517000	Please get me out Frogger Frogger Frogger as hell.
1517000	1518560	And that was the first game I was on.
1518560	1520560	So it was like, is this what this job is going to be?
1520560	1524680	But that's a good little life lesson is that, uh, you know, if you have a positive attitude,
1524680	1525920	you can achieve anything.
1525920	1526920	That's right.
1526920	1527920	Leaving your dream.
1527920	1528920	The more you know.
1528920	1529920	All right.
1529920	1534640	Well, thank you for giving us a little bit of the 10 year old behind the scenes dirt.
1534640	1535640	We appreciate it.
1535640	1536640	Yeah.
1536640	1537920	But, um, so now you're, now you're doing other stuff.
1537920	1539920	You're doing stuff that's a little more with the film stuff.
1539920	1540920	Yeah.
1540920	1541920	Yeah.
1541920	1545360	Education and you know, video telecourses, ITV classes, things like that.
1545360	1546500	It's, it's pretty fun.
1546500	1549080	And I know your wife is a teacher too, so you kind of, you know, you're, you're like
1549080	1550080	a whole little teaching.
1550080	1554280	We all work in like education and her, uh, her oldest brother does as well.
1554280	1555280	He's a teacher.
1555280	1556280	Her parents were teachers.
1556280	1558360	It's a very education based family.
1558360	1560560	So when I got to work at a school, I'm like, oh, this is cool.
1560560	1561560	Yeah.
1561560	1563000	I get to hear all their war stories and now I have some of my own though.
1563000	1566280	I'm not a teacher, but still I, I interact with faculty and students and stuff.
1566280	1567280	It's pretty cool.
1567280	1568280	Very cool.
1568280	1569280	Very cool.
1569320	1574120	You know, stay a while and comment on the news with us and when we get into the second
1574120	1577000	half of the show tonight, we're going to talk a lot about the best and worst of the year.
1577000	1580320	So you'll definitely be talking along with us there.
1580320	1584400	And at the end of the show tonight, we're going to let you finally make up the segment
1584400	1588040	that was forever lost with your classic game of the week because Jamie wasn't here that
1588040	1589040	week.
1589040	1590040	So we let you do the classic game of the week.
1590040	1593680	So she has her own game this week, but we're going to let you do your makeup at the end.
1593680	1597300	So you, your teacher, you're familiar, or you're not a teacher yourself, you're in education.
1597300	1598520	You're familiar with makeup work.
1598560	1599560	Yeah.
1599560	1600560	This is like your makeup assignment.
1600560	1601560	So I still have my notes.
1601560	1602560	There you go.
1602560	1603560	Well done.
1603560	1608560	So I got made fun of last time I brought a binder, like notebook style line paper instead
1608560	1609560	of a computer.
1609560	1610560	You're ready to go.
1610560	1611560	You're more prepared than any of us.
1611560	1612560	I love it.
1612560	1613560	All right.
1613560	1616120	I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1616120	1618840	Act Def says teaching is cool if you have the patience.
1618840	1619840	Yeah.
1619840	1621040	You know, it's funny.
1621040	1623080	I'm kind of a teacher too, but I'm a corporate trainer.
1623080	1624200	It's technically my title.
1624200	1625760	So, you know, a little different.
1625760	1626760	Okay.
1627000	1629720	We've got another question for Flaco, so why not?
1629720	1632920	Another question, did you ever find a bug in a game you tested that was never fixed
1632920	1633920	upon release?
1633920	1636280	I actually have an answer for this and it was a Winx game.
1636280	1640480	And this is like, it was, hurry up and go download it, Tiger Claw.
1640480	1641480	Yeah.
1641480	1642480	Game Boy Advance game.
1642480	1645500	And it was towards the end of the game and it's a really horrible bug and it was very
1645500	1646500	hard to reproduce.
1646500	1651880	It took me, I did try to reproduce like a hundred times and I got it like, first I was
1651880	1654040	getting like one time at every 50 I'd get it.
1654040	1655640	And then I got it to like one out of a hundred.
1655640	1659200	Then I tested it a hundred more times after they said they fixed it and it didn't happen
1659200	1660200	anymore.
1660200	1664680	And it was a game breaking bug where if you saved your game and then you walked into a
1664680	1667920	certain part of a wall, you'd walk through the wall and it would break the game and you
1667920	1672720	would never be able to, since you saved your game, you wouldn't be able to restart it.
1672720	1674920	You would pretty much a game killing game at the end.
1674920	1677280	You have to start all the way over from the beginning.
1677280	1681080	And they sound, they thought they'd fixed it, but then a customer service got a call
1681080	1685240	about it, you know, when after the aim and release and this little girl was trying to
1685240	1688140	play the game and it happened to her and she was stuck.
1688140	1691320	And I was like, the customer service person came and asked like, is there any way out
1691320	1692320	of this?
1692320	1693320	And I was like, there isn't.
1693320	1697480	That is a, that is a game killing bug and I thought so bad little girl, but it must
1697480	1701620	have been like an insane chance cause it's very rare they have you test like a test something
1701620	1705780	like a hundred times, but that it was such a big bug that I tried to do it and if I couldn't
1705780	1709320	get it to happen one out of a hundred, then they're like, okay, then we'll, we'll release
1709320	1710320	it.
1710560	1715280	You tried, but because you didn't try hard enough, some little girl's winks dreams were
1715280	1716280	shattered.
1716280	1717840	I need to try 500 times.
1717840	1723800	She threw that game boy advance at the TV, at the dog, and the lives were altered.
1723800	1727080	If you restarted from that save point, it would still, you would still be bugged and
1727080	1730040	you couldn't complete the game cause a door wouldn't open for you cause you could just
1730040	1732240	walk right through it and then it wouldn't trigger the rest of the level.
1732240	1733640	It's not the first game to have some of that.
1733640	1735160	Zelda or some shit had that too.
1735160	1739200	Remember they had to put out that fix on the Wii, the Zelda patch channel.
1739200	1740200	Bubble Bubble.
1740200	1741200	Yeah.
1741200	1744720	No boss on level 30 and Bubble Bubble, you know, there's, there's worse things that have
1744720	1745720	happened.
1745720	1746720	The card fighters ones.
1746720	1747720	All right.
1747720	1750720	Uh, we're going to get into the news and all that good stuff.
1750720	1753160	We just wanted to say there was no show last week.
1753160	1755040	Sorry about it, but you know, it was the holidays.
1755040	1757520	I think a lot of your favorite podcast didn't end up doing a show.
1757520	1759160	We had a lot of stuff going on.
1759160	1766920	So, um, also, uh, we hope you guys had a safe holiday and um, also a happy new year and
1766920	1767920	all that good stuff.
1767920	1771640	Cause we, we won't be doing another show until it is 2013 so we want to wish you all a happy
1771640	1773960	new year and a safe new year.
1773960	1778040	Remember guys, if you're going to drink and drive plan in advance, what is going to be
1778040	1779400	your way to get home safely?
1779400	1780580	Do not drink and drive.
1780580	1785600	Get somebody sober, stay at, get a hotel, get a taxi, whatever you got to do.
1785600	1786600	All right.
1786600	1788640	Um, let's get into how our gaming weeks were.
1788640	1791760	I know I had a very busy gaming week, but let's start with a dark soccer.
1791760	1792760	How was your gaming week?
1792760	1794800	I played Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
1795760	1796760	Kicking it old school.
1796760	1797760	Yeah.
1797760	1800360	And then I realized, wait, why the crap am I trying to play this with the keyboard when
1800360	1805240	I could just hook up the nomad and play it on the Genesis?
1805240	1812320	So anyway, that was a one thing that I tried to play and I did play some more of that stupid
1812320	1816160	fairy solitaire game because it's stupid and addicting and stupid.
1816160	1817160	Did I say stupid?
1817160	1819160	Cause it's really stupid.
1819160	1823480	Um, and uh, oh yeah, I did play some Mass Effect.
1823480	1831920	Actually, I played a lot of Mass Effect and I played, um, wow, like for about 15 minutes
1831920	1834280	and um, I bought some games.
1834280	1836160	I got Limbo and I got closure.
1836160	1843320	I think I got closure though before last week, which is a neat game that uses light to create
1843320	1847980	your platforms or whatever the light shines on is what actually exists.
1847980	1849980	If there's no light on it, it doesn't exist.
1849980	1854140	So if you step back outside your spotlight, you'll fall through the ground and you can
1854140	1857420	either fall into another level or you can fall to your death.
1857420	1858420	That's part of it.
1858420	1862340	I bought Assassin's Creed 2, which is the only game in that series that I ever really,
1862340	1868620	you know, care about because it's set in Renaissance Italy and just, I don't know.
1868620	1870460	I kind of want to gank a de Medici.
1870460	1873340	You know, wouldn't that be fun?
1873340	1875420	Do you know who the de Medicis were?
1875420	1877420	You shook your head.
1877420	1882540	The de Medicis hired Michelangelo to design defenses for the house.
1882540	1886340	Not Michelangelo, Leonardo, one of those two.
1886340	1890460	And I remember one of them used to like mumble to himself in like one of the de Medicis diaries
1890460	1895500	and a bunch of them were popes and they also were persecuted during the bonfire of the
1895500	1896500	vanities.
1896500	1897500	Wow.
1897500	1899940	I'm picturing Ninja Turtles, but I know you're not talking about that.
1899940	1903840	Fifth Dream in our chat room says, Dark Sakura, is it taking you this long to beat Mass Effect
1903840	1905100	or do you play it over and over?
1905100	1906100	I play it over and over.
1906100	1908260	I'm on my sixth play through right now.
1908260	1911540	And my big thing now is that I got FlyCam to work.
1911540	1913940	I finally bothered working on FlyCam.
1913940	1918580	So now I've been going around getting compromising screen captures of my character shooting things
1918580	1920380	and lasers and stuff.
1920380	1923980	And I finally figured out now how to get FlyCam to work in the cinematics.
1923980	1926100	So that's going to be even better.
1926100	1929580	Lots of fun screens.
1929580	1934580	And sort of speaking of video games, Mass Effect dot tumbler dot com.
1934580	1935940	Picking up some steam.
1935940	1937740	There you go.
1937740	1939660	Speaking of steam, more stuff needs to go on sale.
1939660	1940660	The end.
1940660	1941660	All right.
1941660	1946340	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1946340	1948340	I bought a lot of things.
1948340	1950940	Ironically, though, nothing from steam.
1950940	1953380	I mean, it is on steam, but it's not from steam.
1953380	1954940	So that that's weird thing.
1954940	1957340	It's like because steam had a bunch of stuff on sale.
1957340	1959460	But you know who also had stuff on sale?
1959460	1960460	Amazon.
1960460	1966220	Amazon had a ton of shit on sale and they had a ton of bundles on sale for really cheap.
1966220	1971140	Like I picked up one with Bioshock one and two and Duke Nukem Forever and Borderlands
1971140	1973380	Game of the Year edition, even though I already have it.
1973380	1977700	So obviously I'm going to be giving away games at some point soon.
1977700	1982660	There's also another THQ bundle that they had that had like seven games in it for like
1982660	1983660	seven bucks.
1983660	1986740	It's like, fuck, I can't pass that up.
1986740	1988980	That's awesome.
1988980	1995060	And then then I bought something else because I've been talking about it for a long time
1995060	1996060	now.
1996060	2000120	I'm just like, you know, for that price, I can't I can't pass that up.
2000120	2005980	So I bought and actually played a good 13 hours of Final Fantasy 11.
2005980	2009400	And it's definitely different from when I was playing it before.
2009400	2011020	I didn't know what the fuck was going on.
2011020	2015580	And there's it's a seriously it's a ghost town there.
2015580	2020660	And here's the funniest part, I actually tweeted about this because I was trying to get a few
2020660	2021660	other people to buy.
2021660	2027200	It was down to five bucks for everything like the game and all of the expansions.
2027200	2028200	Five dollars.
2028200	2029200	Well, they're ramping up.
2029200	2032060	They just announced the release of the next expansion is like the end of March or something.
2032060	2035780	So they're probably just trying to get a lot of people that will want to buy the expansion
2035780	2036980	full price.
2036980	2037980	That game.
2037980	2041900	I mean, we're probably getting to we're getting the predictions, I know, for 2013 later on.
2041900	2043780	But that game is going free to play this year.
2043780	2045380	There's our next year.
2045380	2046500	There's no way.
2046500	2047500	It's dead.
2047500	2050440	I mean, it's just there's no one there.
2050440	2054060	Like I was literally I'm soloing myself as a white mage right now.
2054060	2059460	I'm up to level 17 solo because you get so much more experience now, not even necessarily
2059460	2061580	just from the book burning the book burning.
2061580	2064700	I didn't really do that that much because there's no one like, you know how you would
2064700	2067600	say you were saying go do the book burning with parties up.
2067600	2068600	There's no one there.
2068600	2069600	There's no one there.
2069600	2071960	They're all gone in Guskin mines and Guskin mines.
2071960	2072960	There's no one there.
2072960	2076480	All like rank 99 or like level 99 stuff.
2076480	2078760	So there's no one to book burn with.
2078760	2084520	And you know, so I kind of did it a little bit through through one of the tombs or whatever
2084520	2085640	right next to Ron for.
2085640	2090360	But it's a little delayed reaction from dark Tetsuya in our chat room.
2090360	2091360	Wait, what?
2091360	2092640	Loki went back to Final Fantasy 11.
2092640	2095520	Yeah, I don't know if it's going to I mean, I don't know if I'm actually going to pay
2095520	2096520	for it.
2096520	2099640	But I'm playing for the 30 days at the very least, because, you know, I got it for 10
2099640	2100640	bucks.
2100640	2101640	And so I'm going to check it out.
2101720	2106240	It's just I kind of want to have it because I do think it's going to go free to play and
2106240	2108120	I just want to be ready for when that happens.
2108120	2109260	Fifth Dream in chat.
2109260	2110260	Got it on your recommendation.
2110260	2111260	Yeah.
2111260	2112260	So you weren't alone.
2112260	2113260	Yeah.
2113260	2114260	So good.
2114260	2115260	And but seriously, there's like no one around.
2115260	2119180	I mean, there's I was doing just checks of different places like the dunes.
2119180	2122040	There's like 19 people there.
2122040	2124240	Maybe nobody levels there anymore.
2124240	2125240	No one.
2125240	2126420	That's that's just not just there.
2126420	2128560	There's no one place where people are like.
2128560	2129560	I was like, OK.
2129560	2131920	I was like, OK, there's probably people there.
2131920	2132920	Nope.
2132920	2133920	There's like 10 people there.
2133920	2136840	And we're like, you know, there's just it's just a ghost town.
2136840	2142740	What I usually do, I go in or that time, that month or two that I was on it, you zone in
2142740	2146280	the Guskin mines, see if there's anybody fighting right at the very start.
2146280	2151220	Like once you run past the initial like cave and just do a say, please invite to what they
2151220	2152220	don't call it raid.
2152220	2153220	What do they call it?
2153220	2154220	Alliance or something.
2154220	2155460	Please invite to alliance or whatever party.
2155460	2156460	Can I have it?
2156460	2157640	You know, the whole auto translating.
2157640	2159040	And they'll just invite you right into the party.
2159040	2160040	So it goes.
2160040	2163320	So even if there's only 10 people in there, if they're all doing the leveling thing, just
2163320	2166400	so I'm also not high enough level to do that because I'm only level 17 right now.
2166400	2167400	Do it.
2167400	2168400	Seventeen's a great level for that.
2168400	2169400	Yeah, maybe.
2169400	2170400	Oh, trust me.
2170400	2171400	Trust me.
2171400	2172400	People start doing it at 12.
2172400	2173400	All right.
2173400	2174400	Well, I don't know.
2174400	2175400	It's just all new to me.
2175400	2178840	So right now I'm just soloing and I'm just going to probably try to get the 20 so I can
2178840	2183280	get my subclass thing going again and do all that stuff.
2183280	2184280	And I don't know.
2184280	2187000	By that time, it'll be the end of January and then they'll quit because I don't want
2187000	2190000	to pay 13 bucks a month for it.
2190000	2193480	But it's interesting and like I said, it's very different.
2193480	2195480	Like, I don't know what's going on anymore.
2195480	2199040	Playing it on the computer now versus what you had like five years ago, I'm sure is a
2199040	2200040	big shock to me.
2200040	2202720	Well, yeah, I can max out everything and I play on a controller.
2202720	2204600	So, you know, I do that.
2204600	2208720	I mean, I have my macros still, but since I'm playing on my laptop, you know, I just
2208720	2213040	use my macros on my keyboard and I play everything else on my Xbox 360 controller.
2213040	2216520	I used to have all of my macros done through my top two triggers.
2216560	2219600	Yeah, it's just I could do that, too, but I just don't want to.
2219600	2224040	I mean, I just it's a lot easier for me just to, you know, take my hand off the controller
2224040	2227040	and do, you know, control one, control two or whatever.
2227040	2228520	So I've just been doing that.
2228520	2235760	And I don't know, I've noticed like some new character, like new things like floating around
2235760	2236760	like there's all these pixies.
2236760	2239560	I don't know where the hell those are, but I pick fights with them and kill them.
2239560	2242640	Although it's weird, though, because I was resting one time and one of them healed me.
2242680	2245400	They come by and they heal you and they randomly raise you like if you're dead.
2246600	2252080	Oh, well, I've been just pissing them off and trying to kill them way to go.
2252080	2254160	Fuck you. Fuck you.
2255280	2256640	I agree with acidic vampire.
2256640	2258040	It's boring and it's a chore.
2258160	2259560	I was just read his comment.
2259560	2263960	A city vampire says I went to went back to fantasy eleven a few months ago, but stopped.
2264120	2266560	It did get boring and it was more of a chore than entertaining.
2266560	2269360	Yeah, that's what I'm kind of thinking, too, because there's not anyone on there.
2269360	2272560	But like I said, you know, just want to get the software and get it downloaded and
2272600	2274600	check it out just for a little bit, just because I was curious.
2274760	2277840	Ten bucks. I mean, that's less than a month of actually paying for it.
2277840	2280040	And five bucks, if you got lucky, that's even better.
2280400	2283440	But, you know, it's all the expansion so far.
2283440	2284760	You know, the new one will probably come out.
2284760	2290640	But I figure and I started a new character, too, because I could have done it on my
2290640	2294280	old account. Of course, I wouldn't have gotten a free month on my free month.
2294280	2296800	So, you know, I started a whole new one and.
2298600	2302520	I don't know, it's all right, it's just I wish there was someone to play with.
2302520	2304520	And there's really no one around.
2304520	2306880	I mean, it's just empty.
2306880	2309440	I'd love to come play, but if I hadn't burned myself out on it.
2309840	2313080	No, seriously, it's just it's very, very empty.
2313080	2316160	And I know you can get like what AI characters or whatever to help you out.
2316160	2317480	I'm not really sure how that works.
2317480	2321440	And I don't either. I think something like I said, I don't really know what's going
2321440	2322600	on in the game at all.
2322600	2325400	And I was like trying to remember what I'm supposed to be doing as far.
2325400	2328840	I mean, I know we're the kind of level and stuff before, but I was trying to remember
2328840	2332360	like what I'm supposed to be doing as far as like, you know, I know there's some
2333240	2338360	Sindori quests and stuff that you can do and just I don't know it.
2339360	2340560	I'm enjoying it somewhat.
2340560	2345160	It's just kind of good to like just play it and like let my mind just kind of go
2345160	2346480	because it's there's really no.
2346720	2348640	But there's like literally no one around.
2348640	2352040	Like I was just running around and I run across a couple of people and that's it.
2352120	2357360	And like even buying stuff from like the auction houses, stuff you need, it's just
2357360	2359200	not there because there's no one there.
2359680	2362320	Out of curiosity, is this getting you jazzed for Final Fantasy 14?
2362520	2362920	Nope.
2364400	2365320	No, I thought I'd try.
2365360	2366120	Not at all.
2366120	2371160	I mean, I saw a video of it looks nice, but it's just no, I'd rather honestly, when
2371160	2374880	Final Fantasy 14 comes out, I'd rather wait for this to go free play and play this
2374880	2379280	instead because this seems like it'd be more more interesting.
2379280	2382840	I mean, a 14 looks all right, but I'm sure it's not going to run that great on my
2382840	2383160	laptop.
2383160	2388160	I mean, it'll run all right on my laptop, but it's just not going to be, you know, as
2388200	2392160	smooth and I don't know how many people are going to be playing it.
2394240	2395080	It looks nice though.
2395120	2398440	I mean, it's just, I like 11.
2398440	2398920	I don't know.
2398920	2401480	It's 11 that I dedicate a lot, a lot of time to.
2401600	2401920	Okay.
2401920	2405760	So anyways, enough with 11, but other things I've been playing, I actually played
2405960	2407320	Borderlands 2 and went back to that.
2407320	2410040	So I've been playing co-op with my coworker.
2410360	2413240	So we've been playing through that and that it's actually pretty awesome.
2413240	2415160	So we got a little bit through the storyline.
2415160	2418920	Finally met up with, um, Oh, who the fuck is it?
2419480	2420840	Uh, the little girl that's crazy.
2420840	2422600	I don't remember her name anyways.
2422640	2423400	Um,
2426800	2427760	a tiny Tina.
2427800	2428600	That's the one.
2428920	2433760	So I met up with tiny Tina and she's just crazy, but I love the, just the humor in
2433760	2437840	the game is hilarious, you know, where she's like, you know, I need you to collect
2437840	2440600	my badonkadonks, which are these giant missiles.
2440600	2444960	And so then she straps, you know, these stuffed dolls to it.
2444960	2445320	Okay.
2445320	2447720	Put the damsels on the train track, you know?
2447840	2452240	And so she, and then she's like, okay, signal me when, when you want me to fire
2452240	2453040	these or whatever.
2453040	2454280	And she's like, I got tired of waiting.
2454280	2457760	So I fired it anyways, and it blows up the train track.
2457760	2461600	And then she's just like, Oh, it's just the humor.
2461600	2463280	The dialogue in the game is just awesome.
2463280	2466040	So, um, so that's pretty cool.
2466080	2467960	And we're just playing through that a little bit.
2468040	2470000	And what else did I play this week?
2470240	2473040	Um, modern warfare three, a little bit more of that still.
2473280	2479400	Um, I got this device called a Moga, which is from a company called PowerA.
2479400	2482600	They were actually giving them away for like one day as part of like the secret
2482600	2483640	Santa promotion thing.
2484040	2490040	And so basically what a Moga is, it's this Bluetooth controller for an Android phone.
2490040	2493920	And what's kind of cool about it though, is it has this little like slot that, or
2493920	2499200	this little clasp that you can kind of, um, adjust to fit your phone and you play
2499200	2501320	like a handheld gaming pad.
2501320	2506240	I mean, it looks kind of similar to like a Xbox 360 controller crossed with a
2506600	2511400	classic controller because they've got the analog placements of the Xbox 360.
2511400	2516440	There's no D pad, although the left analog kind of has this diamond thing on it
2516440	2519360	where it kind of does it eight way.
2519560	2523960	Um, or it has it where you can kind of do it almost like a direction on it.
2524080	2525400	Um, to make it a little bit easier.
2525400	2529200	And then of course, you know, the X, Y, A, B buttons and two shoulder buttons.
2529600	2532440	Um, and what's kind of cool is it came with some games with it.
2532440	2535880	It came with modern combat four, which I haven't been able to download yet because
2535880	2539480	my phone, it's the way they have it partitioned.
2539480	2544920	I've got like, you know, 16 gigs on it, but two gigs of it is dedicated to apps.
2545080	2550720	And there's no easy way to download something into that open, like that kind
2550720	2552680	of virtual SD card that's in there.
2553240	2556200	Um, so I've been unable to download that, but I was able to download
2556200	2558440	Sonic CD for it and it plays awesome.
2558520	2560160	I mean, it's just, it works great.
2560400	2564400	And so they've comes with that comes a Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man.
2564400	2566520	So, but it works good with the controller.
2566520	2570760	So, uh, I am glad to see that this does work with Grand Theft Auto Vice City,
2570800	2572680	which is just really CHD version of that.
2572680	2575400	So, and I hear that's not selling as well as they had hoped.
2575480	2577320	Well, I don't know if that's probably help.
2577640	2580920	I mean, and this thing normally, I mean, if you, if I even get for free,
2580920	2584160	it would have cost me 50 bucks, but I think it's worth it.
2584160	2587680	And if you have a tablet or whatever, it will work wirelessly with your
2587680	2590240	tablet because it's Bluetooth, which is kind of awesome.
2590240	2592280	So, uh, you know, if you're looking for a controller, that might
2592280	2593400	not be a bad one to pick up.
2593920	2597400	Um, and it's, it's pretty small to you fits in your pocket.
2597600	2601680	So I had that and, uh, what else did I apply this week?
2601920	2602240	I don't know.
2602240	2602960	I have a lot of games.
2602960	2605040	Like I said, I bought stuff on steam sales and stuff.
2605080	2607520	We've got like, he's, I'm hopefully going to give away for some games
2607520	2609920	that I already have, uh, or games.
2609920	2610720	I just don't want to play.
2611160	2615440	And, um, so we'll figure out a way to do that soon.
2615640	2617560	And yeah, sounds good.
2618400	2618800	All right.
2618840	2621640	Well, I want to move on with our gaming weeks, but I want to say hello to
2621640	2623240	somebody else who's joining us in studio.
2623240	2625640	Who's kind of been walking in and out, which he's allowed to
2625640	2626920	do because it's his place too.
2626920	2628160	Everybody say hello to Alan.
2628240	2628720	Hello.
2628880	2629440	How are you doing Alan?
2629560	2630000	Good.
2630080	2630440	I'm sorry.
2630440	2634160	I was sick last week and closed down the OLR studio with my Ebola.
2634840	2636200	But you're feeling much better now, right?
2636200	2636440	Yes.
2636440	2637720	I had a head cold for six days.
2637720	2638480	I don't recommend it.
2639680	2644680	How did you, how did you finally cure yourself of the Ebola super yucky barf?
2645520	2648920	You just wait six days until your immune system gets rid of it.
2648960	2650600	There's really nothing I can do.
2651320	2654520	I bought this, um, spray for my nose that felt like acid.
2655040	2655680	That wasn't fun.
2655680	2656280	It worked.
2656320	2657320	I could breathe afterwards.
2657320	2660080	Cause I think it burned out my skull, but did you, do you blame
2660080	2661480	Obamacare for making you sick?
2662000	2662440	I'm just kidding.
2662440	2662960	Don't answer that.
2663000	2663280	All right.
2663280	2665840	Let's I blame coworkers.
2666560	2666840	All right.
2666840	2667480	Fair enough.
2668840	2669200	All right.
2669400	2671760	Uh, let's, uh, talk about your gaming week.
2671760	2672680	So you were sick.
2672680	2674880	So that's a great chance for you to play lots of games.
2675080	2676600	Nothing like being sick on Christmas.
2676600	2677160	What did you play?
2677280	2681640	I was, I only played three games really the last couple of weeks.
2681680	2682240	Wow.
2682920	2687240	Um, this is more a discussion for Horde house, but I have no problems
2687240	2690280	at all with this expansion pandaria, but the magic has been gone for me
2690280	2694400	since like this summer, so I haven't been playing it nearly as much as I should.
2694840	2695960	But I got played some wow.
2695960	2698520	I played some Mass Effect two and I played some walking dead.
2699320	2700960	So Mass Effect two.
2700960	2701120	Okay.
2701160	2703520	We've heard a lot about Mass Effect on the show, but you do like this
2703520	2705640	mod thing, right with high res textures.
2705680	2708320	Well, I'm on my third character.
2708720	2712760	She is my female paragon, which is kind of like a good guy.
2712760	2716320	Cause my first woman that I played was a renegade, which is more kind of an asshole.
2716880	2720640	So it's my third career and yeah, I have all these high res textures
2720640	2725040	for Mass Effect two that the community has made and they look awesome.
2725080	2728200	But the only problem is, is that when you load them up, it takes it literally,
2728200	2731920	I have to start it up and walk away and it takes the game 15 minutes to load.
2733240	2738240	So I, if I want to play Mass Effect two, I got to give at least an hour
2738240	2741640	to 90 minutes time, because if I'm going to let the game load for 20 minutes,
2742000	2743600	I can't just do a mission and sign off.
2743600	2744280	It's a waste of time.
2744360	2745600	You have way too much patience.
2746280	2750000	Well, I can all tab and look at Chrome or mess with my phone or tumbler tumbler.
2750040	2750440	Yeah.
2750680	2750960	All right.
2751120	2752720	Uh, let's talk about walking dead.
2752760	2755160	That's again, we haven't talked a lot about on this show, but you,
2755200	2756360	uh, checked it out this week.
2756360	2756760	What'd you think?
2757200	2759280	I don't want to steal your thunder, but it was nice.
2759320	2762920	Um, I was spoiled because I am on tumblr a lot.
2762920	2766640	When episode five came out within a day, all of the animated gifts and
2766640	2770000	YouTube clips and just discussions were going on my dash about what
2770000	2773480	happens in the ending of, um, uh, chapter five.
2773840	2779880	So I was like, Oh, that ending look, I'm not going to say anything about it, but
2780080	2783400	I was like, I guess I should say that now that I know how it ends and how everyone
2783400	2785280	is losing their shit over how it ends in a good way.
2785320	2790840	So I just, and then also I saw you playing it and the fact it was 10 bucks on XBLA,
2790840	2795000	right, and it was 12 bucks for the season pass on steam and like steam, of course,
2795000	2797840	is having it's we hate you and we want you to be poor sale.
2797880	2800080	So, um, that's a good name for it.
2800200	2803600	So, um, despite the fact that, you know, you had the ending already ruined for
2803600	2806320	you of episode five, how did you enjoy playing through episode one?
2806920	2807760	It was good.
2807840	2812040	I'm trying to juggle between being a perfectionist and wanting to play it with
2812080	2815600	a FAQ open, just so I can see all the different ways I could control the story
2815600	2818520	in later chapters, which I know is cheating, but I don't have that count.
2818640	2819480	I have that kind of time.
2819480	2820040	I don't care.
2820440	2824920	Um, and also just wanting to be a contrarian because I wanted to do stuff
2824920	2828200	that was opposite of what you were doing so that I can say, Oh, well, if you do
2828200	2829680	this, then this is what happens instead.
2830000	2832560	Cause like you have an iPhone and I have an Android cause I'm different like that.
2832840	2838560	So yeah, I was like, I wanted, I'm trying to juggle between having things be as
2838560	2841680	good as possible for my character, but also wanting to do like backwards.
2842000	2842960	Ass backwards stuff.
2843000	2845520	Doesn't that sound like somebody you want to date guys?
2845520	2848800	Somebody that does intentionally the opposite of everything that you do.
2848800	2854120	Just in video games and he has an Android and I have an iPhone.
2855320	2856840	Yeah, clearly he's smarter than you.
2857040	2858000	Hey, fuck off.
2858080	2858440	All right.
2859480	2862520	So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to steal your thunder, but if I'm going to mimic
2862520	2866880	everything you do when you play, I should just sit behind you and watch you play
2867720	2868240	myself.
2868240	2870320	I'm going to have different people live than you do.
2870320	2871240	And I'm going to do.
2871240	2871520	Yeah.
2872080	2872280	All right.
2872280	2872680	That's fair.
2872760	2873120	That's fair.
2873440	2874640	But you do recommend it.
2874960	2875240	Yeah.
2876160	2877560	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
2878280	2879120	Tiny tower.
2880120	2880720	Sucks.
2880760	2881200	No, I'm kidding.
2881480	2881920	All right.
2882360	2883200	Uh, we'll move on.
2883200	2885600	So you're going to come back for part B and talk about game of the
2885600	2886440	year and all that with us, right?
2886680	2887080	Yes.
2887200	2887520	Okay.
2887560	2888120	We'll see you then.
2888560	2890760	Uh, for now, Flaco, how was your gaming week?
2891600	2896240	I had a, I had a very busy gaming week because I had the week off of work and
2896240	2899200	I'm not playing wow right now because wow eats up a lot of time.
2899200	2902360	I love it, but I just wanted to really focus on console stuff this week.
2902360	2905840	So I played more Nino Cooney demo.
2906960	2909520	I just play cause my son likes to watch it cause it's a cartoon.
2909520	2911280	And, and then I liked playing it too.
2911280	2912360	And so it gives me an excuse.
2913000	2916840	I played the, I finished the walking dead after Christmas.
2916840	2921560	I took, I took Christmas off of playing it, uh, because, uh, Exeter was in town
2921560	2923720	and he didn't want to see how it was ended.
2923880	2925360	So I waited and I waited.
2925400	2927360	And as soon as he left, I finished playing it.
2927400	2928960	So, and it was great.
2929000	2930240	It was a great game.
2930480	2934240	And I feel so bad that Alan got spoiled on the ending because I think that really
2934240	2936000	helps not knowing what's going to happen.
2936560	2939800	It's a, I think I know what happens, but I'm really trying to keep my
2939800	2942640	spells self spoiler free and I'm just kind of trying to forget.
2942640	2946080	I heard that and just taking the game at face value, but I'm still really
2946080	2948280	enjoying episode one so far personally.
2948320	2950320	I thought I knew what happened and luckily I was wrong.
2950480	2951320	Oh, okay, cool.
2951520	2953160	So yeah, I thought I heard a spoiler.
2953160	2955800	Like I thought, and I was like, I thought I read something for two sec.
2955800	2956720	I saw some words.
2956720	2958760	I'm like, ah, the words erased from my memory.
2959000	2962040	And then I just, you know, kept playing and I was like, oh good.
2962040	2963000	What I thought was going to happen.
2963000	2965720	Didn't happen just cause I read a few words and started making assumptions.
2965720	2969880	So, so just real quick about, you know, the game, would this be something
2969880	2973160	that would be all right for someone that doesn't follow the series?
2973160	2975640	Cause I honestly, I've never watched nothing to do with a TV show.
2975640	2977240	No, you don't have to read the comic book either.
2977240	2980000	It doesn't matter as long as you know, the basic concept.
2980000	2983400	I mean, they pretty much explain everything for you anyway, because it
2983400	2988000	takes place and I guess at the start of the whole thing anyway, and you're
2988000	2991040	in someone else's shoes, so everything's getting explained to you as if you were
2991040	2995760	brand new, so you get the rules of the series and the comic, like it's
2995760	2997400	really easy to jump into it.
2997840	2998800	I don't read the comics.
2998800	2999800	I just watched the show.
2999840	3003440	So I don't even watch the show and I was able to get into it.
3003960	3007120	I mean, it has a, it has an ambiguous opening, but like a lot
3007120	3008960	of TV shows and movies do so.
3008960	3010840	The show and I believe the comic opens the same way.
3010840	3014000	Like nobody, I don't think, because like I said, didn't read the comic,
3014000	3017480	but I don't think anyone knows how the whole thing started.
3017720	3019200	Everybody gets kind of thrown into it.
3019200	3020520	So they started the same way.
3020920	3024280	Um, now obviously trying to be very, uh, careful not to spoil anything.
3024280	3026880	Cause we have like act-deaf and Chad is like, no spoilers, please.
3026880	3027960	No, we're not, we're not going to spoil.
3027960	3028840	We're not assholes, don't worry.
3029120	3034600	But, um, uh, I have heard a lot of people say like through the Twitters
3034600	3038360	and so forth, that the walking dead has one of the best endings in a video
3038360	3043880	game ever, would you sign up, would you sign ever, but it was really good.
3043920	3048240	I mean, because you're so emotionally invested in the whole game, then when,
3048280	3051920	you know, when you get to the end, it just feels like all the other choices
3051920	3054560	you made are all like important.
3054920	3056880	And that's, that's like a really cool thing.
3056920	3061280	I find that fascinating, like in the wake of everything, everybody complained
3061280	3063800	about with Mass Effect 3 this year, because like Mass Effect 3 was kind
3063800	3067040	of the opposite of that word, but he bitched about the ending unless the
3067120	3069400	first time you played through the ending was with the extended cut.
3069440	3069920	Well, okay.
3069920	3071360	But, but I didn't have that.
3071400	3074960	And before that was in there and so forth, you know, as much as I loved Mass Effect
3074960	3079720	3, the ending, and I still defend the ending to an extent, like I think
3079720	3082160	people blow it way out of proportion.
3082800	3085480	I think it's a fine ending, especially after the extended cut.
3085680	3088960	But one of the biggest bitches even I had with it when I first did it was that it
3088960	3093160	really seemed like a lot of the stuff you were working with, with the galaxy rating
3093160	3096560	and things like that, didn't really end up doing shit when all was said and done.
3096800	3098680	Like it didn't really play into it.
3098680	3100160	And that's where a lot of people got upset with it.
3100160	3102840	So it's kind of funny the way you talk about the walking dead.
3102840	3107000	It really sounds like a lot, like you do get that reward.
3107000	3110560	And maybe, yeah, I mean, it's hard to say because this was probably all in
3110560	3115560	development long before Mass Effect 3 came out, but maybe Telltale kind of
3115560	3119760	saw the reaction to Mass Effect 3's ending and made sure we're not going to do that.
3120200	3120400	Yeah.
3120400	3123480	And it's in the details because the actual, the actual ending you get,
3123520	3125120	everybody gets the same ending.
3125160	3126800	There's not alternate endings to this game.
3127240	3131240	Everybody gets the same one, but it's in the details leading up to that final
3131240	3133160	screen that everybody sees that's different.
3133320	3136480	And the final, like one of the, one of the last kind of confrontations in the
3136480	3141200	game, very heavy on past choices, all the way back to episode one and two and
3141200	3141720	things like that.
3141720	3142360	So fascinating.
3142360	3143320	I mean, it's really cool.
3143320	3145280	And I want to just blow through the whole series.
3145280	3146160	You'll get to that part.
3146160	3147640	You're like, why did I do that?
3147640	3149040	Or why didn't I do this?
3149040	3150720	And it's, it's really cool.
3151520	3154880	It's just, they're really just details and it's story stuff, but I think that's
3154880	3157600	what makes it so good because you're so invested in this so that when that
3157600	3161640	happens, but the actual literal ending is the same for everybody.
3161800	3162080	All right.
3162200	3165840	Like did that, like whatever happens, you know, at the end is the end.
3166520	3167880	Uh, what else for your gaming week?
3168000	3175560	Oh, so for Christmas, my wife got me a PlayStation move, so I was playing a lot
3175560	3176120	of games with that.
3176120	3180840	I immediately got portal two in motion and what else did I get?
3180880	3182840	Oh, I got the little big motion pack.
3182840	3186120	We just got booted from chat cause there's too many people connected guys.
3186120	3188000	So we're not in chat.
3188000	3189280	Did you try to join chat Alan?
3189760	3190960	That was a no, no.
3191000	3191400	Okay.
3191400	3194600	So we had five people join chat and now none of us can be in.
3194600	3197400	Now none of us can be in so fast.
3197480	3198120	We'll be at it.
3198160	3198800	Oh, I will.
3199200	3200160	I'll be back in chat.
3200240	3200600	Okay.
3200720	3201640	As soon as I get my phone up.
3201760	3204440	So we're going to try to get a plan B here in a minute.
3204440	3205960	Alan broke the rule.
3208520	3211840	He's yelling at me from the other room that I didn't know the role I was in.
3211840	3213000	I would have just not been in chat.
3213000	3214000	I didn't have to be in chat.
3214000	3217680	All right, so we're going to try to get back in chat as soon as we can guys.
3217680	3219880	It's going to be a little bit though, so just bear with us.
3220240	3222120	Uh, but anyhow, let's just move forward.
3222120	3223680	So, um, what else for your gaming week?
3223840	3226920	Okay, so yeah, so I got, so my wife gave me the PlayStation move because I've
3226920	3231320	been, I'm always bugging her, uh, her oldest brother and her sister-in-law to
3231320	3233520	borrow theirs, but they are, their kids use it.
3233520	3236000	They played just dance and like, but I want to use it cause I want to play, you
3236000	3239200	know, I played heavy rain when I borrowed theirs and, but then I heard the portal
3239240	3242160	two, uh, in motion pack came out and like, I want that so bad.
3242160	3243680	So my wife just got me one.
3243680	3244440	So now I can play it.
3244440	3246600	I downloaded the portal two in motion.
3246600	3247680	That was really cool.
3248000	3249800	I only played like a couple levels.
3249800	3252520	I played the tutorial and some of the levels after that.
3252920	3253800	It was really fun.
3254160	3256560	A little big planet with move is awesome.
3257160	3259520	Uh, the move levels specifically are really good.
3259880	3263880	And I played some, gosh, what is it called?
3263880	3264680	It's like Cooper.
3264720	3268760	Those had just lame move mini games, but, um, yeah, I'm excited.
3268800	3269440	It works pretty well.
3269440	3274320	And I played the Epic Mickey two demo, which I didn't like because, well, first
3274320	3277200	I played it before I got a motion controller and I thought they were going
3277200	3280080	to fix it where you didn't have to have motion control and they did, but you
3280080	3283640	have to use the right analog stick to kind of aim, you know, where you paint
3283640	3284000	stuff.
3284000	3286000	And so I hated that.
3286000	3287960	So when I got the move, I'm like, oh, let me try it again with that.
3287960	3290680	And it was better with the move, but I still don't like the game.
3291200	3293000	And what else is my gaming week?
3293000	3296440	Oh, and then I bought journey because I finished walking dead and I'm like,
3296440	3298640	ah, I want to play one more game of the year candidate.
3298640	3299600	And I want something short.
3299840	3304960	And I had played the journey demo, uh, when it came out, don't stop believing.
3305240	3305720	Yes.
3306720	3309720	And I actually wasn't that impressed by the demo, but everyone kept saying, well,
3309720	3311800	it's better when you get further into the game or whatever.
3311800	3313560	So, but I just kept putting it off, like I'll get it.
3313560	3314160	What's on sale.
3314320	3316840	Well, it went on sale for PlayStation's winter sale.
3317080	3321400	And so I got it and luckily I didn't have to play the first level again.
3321400	3324160	It actually saved my progress from when I played the demo.
3324280	3327080	So I get to jump right into the game and immediately it gets better.
3327320	3329760	And it is a short game, but I loved it.
3329760	3331080	And the ending is just Epic.
3331120	3334240	Like parts of that remind me of, you know,
3334240	3338360	Corona trigger when you're walking up the mountain and the wind blows,
3338360	3339600	you have to hide behind the trees.
3339600	3340880	So you don't get blown off the mountain.
3341080	3341960	There's stuff in journey.
3341960	3342600	That's like that.
3342600	3343840	I'm like, oh, that's so cool.
3344400	3347080	So it doesn't blow you entirely off the mountain, but it's,
3347320	3348760	there's some really cool stuff in journey.
3348760	3351960	It was reminding me of other games and there's like a kind of a platforming
3351960	3354600	level that's my favorite level and journey where you just have to climb
3354720	3356040	this tower and I'd love it.
3357560	3358880	And it was, it was a lot better.
3358920	3362600	Like I played a couple levels by myself cause I think it's supposed to be
3362600	3363920	online and there's people like there,
3363920	3367320	but I think whoever I was with was way ahead of me and it was really lame.
3367320	3368720	Like I can't keep up with this guy.
3369160	3372560	Uh, but the second time I kind of started again at that because once you beat
3372560	3373880	it, you can start anywhere in the game.
3374080	3375640	So I started at that level again,
3375720	3378320	which is pretty close to the end and I played it through the end again and I
3378320	3381560	had a partner the whole time and I even got a trophy for playing the majority of
3381560	3384120	the game with a one person the whole time.
3384120	3384720	Oh wow. Nice.
3384720	3386560	Yeah. So I just, there's me and this other person.
3386560	3388800	I think we're both kind of the same skill level.
3388800	3390360	Maybe I maybe it was their first time.
3390360	3391640	I don't know, but it was kind of cool.
3391720	3392680	That's awesome. Yeah.
3393200	3395760	Uh, I just want to, just a quick note for the live listeners.
3395760	3399520	I did manage to get back into chat on my mobile because what I did is I did over
3399520	3401040	4g so I have a different IP now.
3401040	3404600	So I am in on mobile, so I will be able to read a chat comment.
3404600	3407960	Some people are still talking about a walking dead in chat right now and uh,
3408280	3408840	let's see.
3408840	3412400	Fantasm chat says journey and a point and click adventure game of the years.
3413000	3417400	That's if you believe everything you read on the internet and seeing the TV shows
3417400	3418000	and stuff. Yeah,
3418000	3421120	it seems like those are the two that are kind of taken a lot of their awards.
3421160	3425240	So they were both awesome. Yeah. That's what I'll say. It's great. Yeah.
3425240	3427040	I love journey. And I, I, like I said,
3427040	3429640	I was a little skeptical cause I played the demo and I wasn't super impressed.
3429640	3431240	I'm like, really? I'm going to play this for, you know,
3431520	3432960	three hours and love it. Well, I loved it.
3433480	3435240	It's a short little three hour game and I love,
3435240	3437400	so you can't always base your impressions of a game off the demo.
3437400	3441520	No Bobby heard that. I had to work that in there. Come on. All right.
3442360	3444680	Uh, anything else you want to share about your gaming week? Um,
3444800	3447560	I think that's basically, Oh, you know what? Uh, on my anniversary,
3447560	3449080	my wife got her hair done and while she was doing that,
3449080	3452520	I played linked to the past on my phone and I'm the last study.
3452520	3455240	I've played it before, but I haven't played in a long time and I'm not,
3455280	3458080	I'm in Gannon's like final dungeon. So good choice.
3458080	3462080	I'm excited to finish that again for the first time in a long time. Okay.
3462080	3463080	I have to ask this.
3463080	3466680	Do you get as pissed off as I do when you're fighting the worm thing and it
3466720	3471720	knocks you off the platform 57 times in a row.
3472240	3475560	Yes. I hate that. I hate anytime. Anything that knocks you off a platform.
3476000	3480160	The first time I ever played that guy, it took me two hours. Oh my gosh.
3480240	3483040	Because I kept getting interrupted by my brothers and every time fall.
3483600	3486480	Luckily I just had the knowledge of doing it before. So this time I was like,
3486480	3491320	okay, I remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The first time it was terrible.
3491360	3492440	So this time I was like, Oh yeah,
3492440	3496160	I can beat this guy down cause I know exactly what to do and I know what spells
3496160	3498200	are abilities to use for each boss. So it's kind of cool.
3499520	3502200	But that was it for my gaming week. Little old school game. You throw it in there.
3502440	3504720	No. All right. Let me talk about my gaming week.
3504760	3506920	Cause some of the games we've already discussed a little bit.
3506920	3511320	I did finally get a chance to check out a walking dead episode one at least. Um,
3511360	3512120	let me just say this.
3512120	3515040	It was good enough where I downloaded episodes two through five right after.
3515040	3517160	I thought it was great. I don't even watch the show.
3517160	3520080	I don't watch a lot of TV shows. And you know, again,
3520400	3522720	I find that there's a lot of people that are like, Oh,
3522720	3525000	I don't want to play the games cause I don't want to spoil myself for the show.
3525000	3530000	So just to be clear, games based off comics show based off books,
3530160	3533320	right? Or something else. So is there based off the, well,
3533320	3534760	it's based off the comic book universe.
3534760	3537160	So it doesn't even spoil the comics cause it's a completely different thing.
3537200	3540520	Yeah. So just they, they go different directions and the characters are there.
3540560	3544000	Most of them are different and so forth. So yeah, you got all that going on.
3544000	3547480	So just don't let that, um, ruin it for you. Um,
3547720	3549480	some other games I played this week, um,
3549520	3551800	I played a couple of racing games actually. Uh,
3551800	3555360	the game rental service sent me a couple of racing games and I checked out need
3555360	3558400	for speed. Most wanted that. Yeah. What do you think?
3558880	3560320	Well, he's using his driving rig,
3561160	3564320	the one he set up for that's going to make any racing game better for GT five.
3564520	3567800	Yeah. He's been pretty into it. He likes it. Yeah.
3567840	3571360	It's interesting cause this is a criterion game and the last big thing I know
3571360	3573240	they did in the racing world was burnout paradise.
3573680	3576840	So it's like somebody got burnout in my needs for speed. Now you don't have like
3576840	3578120	the Epic crashes and all that,
3578120	3581680	but it is like the whole cop chases back in there and so forth.
3581680	3586360	But it's more like open world. Um, I like it. It's, it's fun.
3586360	3587440	It's, you know, kind of,
3587440	3590320	I like the open world element of it and the, um,
3590560	3593880	places you can go and do the races and so forth. But, um, I gotta say,
3594200	3596320	I played another racing game this week that's a little better.
3596320	3599400	So it's been taking my attention away from need for speed. Most wanted.
3599400	3603520	And that is sugar rush. No, I wish, uh, no force of horizon.
3603840	3607560	I've been playing quite a bit of, and it's great. At first,
3607560	3610400	I thought I was going to hate it cause I started playing it and I'm like,
3610440	3615400	what the hell is this? Like Coachella festival in the middle of Colorado,
3616400	3619600	uh, rich spoiled white kids, racing daddy's car and wrecking it.
3619600	3623200	Like what the hell at hipster bands all over the place. What the hell is this?
3623200	3628000	But actually it's they, they, the way they put it together is pretty good. Um,
3628040	3632320	I don't like that you can't customize the protagonist at all, but whatever. Um,
3632360	3634520	that's really a minor bitch. It's not really about that.
3634520	3637560	It's about the racing and the racing element is really good. Uh,
3637640	3641720	I like the fact that they have it set up with a very flexible difficulty.
3641960	3645560	You can play this in like racing game for dummy mode and it's great.
3645760	3647320	Having all the computer easy.
3647320	3651360	You can have the thing like do the braking for you and there's guidelines,
3651360	3654640	all this stuff. Or if you want it to be a little harder,
3654680	3657840	you can turn whatever you want on and off.
3658560	3660160	You can turn the rewind feature off.
3660160	3663220	You can scale the difficulty of the opponents. You can turn off the line,
3663220	3664800	the guideline and GPS thing.
3665040	3668520	You can turn all that stuff and you get more credits as a reward because of it.
3668680	3672240	But like the game experience isn't ruined if you use the handicap or whatsoever.
3672240	3676720	So the way they've implemented the scaling difficulty is really good.
3676760	3678600	So I have to give kudos for that.
3678920	3681360	And as much as I joke about the hipster soundtrack,
3681400	3684240	it actually is a pretty good soundtrack. So I give props for that as well.
3684240	3685800	Although my one minor,
3685800	3690120	minor bitch is that I hate that the game will not remember what radio station
3690120	3692880	I've been listening to. I don't want to switch to the other one, but anyway,
3692880	3695840	that's a really minor bitch. Uh, online support. Pretty good.
3696040	3698240	Did some races with act theft and Bobby the other night.
3698240	3701520	And we're all in the little VOG club on Forza horizon, which by the way,
3701520	3705400	if you have the game request membership to the VOG club, V O G,
3705400	3709240	very easy to find. And I'm an officer now so I can promote people or whatever.
3709240	3712920	So if you want to do that and race with us, it's, it's, it's, it's, I've been,
3712960	3714480	I've been meaning to use my racing.
3714520	3718240	I have a Microsoft racing wheel with the pedals and everything and I have not,
3718440	3721240	I've not used it for anything. I got it like a long time ago.
3721280	3725560	I did not get my ass kicked in online mode as bad as I thought I would. I,
3725560	3727760	we played at least seven or eight races. Yes.
3727760	3730400	I came in last place in a couple of them, but I'm new. I'm allowed to,
3730520	3732080	I came in third place on one of them.
3732160	3734440	Have you painted your car yet?
3734880	3739200	Uh, yes. All I've done is paint it, but I've seen the decal thing.
3739240	3743400	Bobby has a VOG car with like the whole VOG logo with the glowing G.
3743480	3746040	He emulated that logo very well in Forza horizon.
3746240	3749480	And the cool thing is you can actually go into the shop and you can search for
3749480	3753120	VOG and you can download that for your car if you have the screenprints of that
3753120	3757840	to put in my portfolio as the use of the logo. No, that's fine.
3757840	3760680	That's fine. Talk to Bobby about it. I don't know how to do that. So, uh,
3760720	3762480	there you go. And, um,
3763120	3767560	actdeft wants to clarify in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby and I,
3767560	3771320	actdeft are leaders of the VOG club in Forza so you can ask any of us. So yeah,
3771480	3774960	well I think you just ask for membership and whatever officer happens to see it,
3775000	3779440	we'll approve it. So that's all. Um, but um, yeah,
3780360	3782720	even though the whole thing is like Colorado,
3782720	3787040	they're able to do some very varied environments. Like there's a little city,
3787280	3788680	there's some really beautiful,
3788680	3791640	like there's a cliffside race that was just like where you're going through
3791640	3795480	tunnels and stuff that I was just like, Oh man, this is beautiful. Look at. So,
3795760	3799040	um, and yeah, I had a great time with online mode and I love the scaling
3799040	3800920	difficulty. It's, it's a great racing game.
3800920	3803520	It's one of my favorite racing games I played in a very long time. Uh,
3803560	3806120	this is probably the first game I've got from the rental service where I'm like,
3806120	3808560	yeah, I want, I want to keep this one. I'm going to buy it. I'm going to,
3808600	3810840	I'm going to keep it. So yes,
3810880	3812960	highly recommend for as a horizon if you're into racing games,
3813160	3816560	not like the other fours of games at all. That's very important to say.
3816640	3821480	It's arcade more style. And I say that's great. I don't know if this is true.
3821600	3825200	I heard a lot of the people that used to be with bizarre, you know, that made,
3825600	3830400	um, the old, uh, fours of games, right? And then they made, um, uh,
3830480	3835200	blur was the game that shut down that office unfortunately, which was a tragedy.
3835200	3838360	But anyway, I hear a lot of them were involved with this anyway.
3838920	3841560	But I don't know if that's true or not, but I believe it.
3841680	3846640	I would absolutely believe it. So it's, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's great.
3846800	3849440	I'm, I'm loving it. So, uh, now,
3849480	3851280	now that I've said a lot of good things about it,
3851320	3855440	I do need to express one of my kind of complaints.
3855440	3859800	That's a big exclamation point. And it's not so much about the game itself,
3860160	3865160	but it's more about the model and the game industry is in a very interesting
3865560	3866400	place right now.
3866400	3870360	And a lot of people are saying that one of the reasons why the PlayStation Vita
3870760	3874120	is really struggling right now is not just the fact that it's the lack of games,
3874120	3878280	but the fact that you have these like $40 games on the platform when you can get
3878280	3882000	mobile games for 99 cents or a dollar and so forth. But as we all know,
3882160	3886480	the way mobile games sustain themselves is that they try to sell all these extra
3886480	3890440	things and the add ons, the enhancements to try and, you know, get you to like,
3890440	3892680	like tiny tower Alan was talking about earlier.
3892680	3895480	If you want to get the tower bucks so you can get a nice emulator,
3895600	3898600	you can earn those very slowly in game,
3898880	3902400	or you can buy them for real, real money.
3903000	3907120	The reason why I bring that up for is it has a couple of features in it that I
3907120	3909040	think are a little bit shady for real money.
3909320	3913560	And some of that is that you can buy car credits that you can use to basically
3913560	3918360	replace the in game currency to buy the cars instantaneously. Um,
3918400	3922400	you can buy a cheat map or whatever that shows you all the discount, uh,
3922440	3926000	that you, you, one little perk in the game is that as you break certain
3926000	3929720	billboards, you increase the level of your discount you get at the upgrade shop.
3929840	3930040	Well,
3930040	3934880	you can buy a map for real money that shows you where all 100 of those discount
3934880	3937040	billboards are. So it's like kind of makes game easier.
3937280	3940440	Or it didn't just go on game facts or something like that and just do the same
3940440	3941040	thing for free.
3941040	3944000	It's all those like in game cheats you can buy and so forth and what have you.
3944040	3947040	I understand the having different cars as DLC.
3947040	3951360	I understand that having the horizon rally as DLC, but some of this other stuff,
3951880	3954640	it's not that it ruins the game cause you don't have to do it.
3955120	3957800	I just think it's a little bit tacky,
3957840	3962680	especially when it's press right trigger to get it, you know,
3962680	3964320	and then pops at the menu and buy.
3964320	3968440	It's just like quit shoving that shit in my face because it's really tacky to
3968440	3972520	ask me to pay 60 bucks for a game or whatever and then do this stuff on top of
3972520	3976920	it. Now again, I'm just saying I did enjoy the game overall and I didn't pay 60
3976920	3979200	bucks for it. I rented it. So maybe in some ways I did,
3979360	3983160	I did get it for free and I deserve to have all the stuff shut in my face.
3983360	3987080	But if I do decide to take the plunge and spend the 40, 50, 60 bucks to get it,
3987600	3990400	I just wish the game would stop trying to nickel and dime me after that.
3990440	3993840	It's like as a developer, I really think you need to choose which road are you
3993840	3997000	going to go down? Are you going to charge 60 bucks for a fully featured game?
3997200	4000440	Are you going to charge 99 cents for a half ass feature game and try to sell me
4000440	4003160	the $50 worth of features? That's my big question about it.
4003680	4007960	So just saying that's my one little bitch about the thing.
4008800	4012720	Act Efton chat says, Rob, it's people from bizarre and Codemasters.
4013120	4017280	That makes a lot of sense actually. So there you go. All right. By the way,
4017280	4020480	Jamie, uh, I did also get in the car shop, the decal shop.
4020600	4023400	Somebody made a car made with N seven sticker on it.
4023640	4025480	It looks like the Normandy. It's adorable.
4025960	4030840	Okay. I have to play this now. I thought you might say that. All right. Uh,
4030880	4033120	that's it for my gaming week. Uh, I'll leave it at that.
4033240	4037000	I felt like I played like a lot of games in my downtime and was able to play
4037000	4037840	some. Wow.
4037960	4039480	Yeah.

4068120	4071920	It's like G plus dot T O slash orange on radio or something like that.
4072480	4075880	I don't know. Anyway, uh, let's get into some actual news.
4075920	4077000	Loki wants to start us off.
4077160	4082080	So there was, um, a lot of drama with the game war Z, uh,
4082240	4087240	you know, it was released on steam and it wasn't very good because it wasn't
4087480	4088320	finished yet.
4088560	4093200	And there was a bunch of this stuff that they had in the product description
4093360	4094160	talking about, you know,
4094160	4097600	the features of the game and not a lot of that was true.
4097960	4102960	And then it got to the point where it was so bad that valve actually kicked it
4103080	4107120	off steam until, you know, the publisher, or I should say the developer,
4107120	4110760	fixes all the problems and issues with it. Um,
4110780	4115780	so the kind of go along with that now they're having the actual name of the game
4116560	4121560	being suspended and the trademark is kind of gone because of the movie world war
4122400	4127400	Z, which is going to be coming out in 2013 with the zombie typhoon,
4128640	4133720	you know, really weird trailer for that. But, um, yeah, so there, of course,
4133740	4137680	you know, the war Z is a little too close to the world war Z and unfortunately
4137680	4142680	the war Z filed their trademark request a little after world war Z.
4144640	4149240	And so because of that, it's most likely going to go to, you know, paramount.
4150240	4152560	Yeah. So now it's going to be called something else.
4155080	4158040	I thought when I heard about that game that I was like,
4158040	4161760	wasn't there that movie as well? Like I actually did look out for years.
4162040	4166520	I kind of did think there was a, uh, a link between them. So I have to admit,
4167040	4169360	uh, oops, I might not be helping, uh, the game's case here,
4169360	4173000	but I kind of did think they were related at first before I read up a little
4173020	4175160	more on the game. I finally did figure it out. Yeah.
4175160	4179080	And unfortunately the game of me looks kind of like a rip off of the daisy. Um,
4179520	4181280	if I remember correctly, I think this is actually,
4181280	4185020	it's another game that has a similar title, like war something.
4185020	4189320	And it's kind of like a zombie mode of that or a zombie mod of that.
4189800	4192480	But, um, yeah, it kind of sucks.
4192480	4195440	Another MMO trying to compete in that same franchise.
4195440	4199200	Is this the same game that has all that fuckery behind it where the steam thing
4199200	4200840	was misleading and all that? Yes.
4200840	4204300	That was where the guy like use, you know,
4204300	4208480	called his own fans that were abusing the game or whatever,
4208600	4211680	a dirty word and all this stuff. And just like they're just on a kind of on a,
4211720	4213280	you know, claiming there's multiple maps.
4213280	4216600	There's only one claiming that the maps are like 1500 kilometers or whatever.
4216600	4221000	It's not even close. I'm going to holla back to a 2011 reference,
4221000	4224280	but it's like if that ocean marketing guy were running a game company,
4224280	4228120	like that's just what I have pictured in my mind of like this.
4228160	4231440	When I read about this guy and his antics with the game is I'm like, Oh my God,
4231440	4234840	it's like that ocean marketing crap all over. Yeah. It's just, it's not,
4235000	4236120	not boding well.
4236200	4239600	And unfortunately I don't think the game will be able to recover from it because
4239600	4243600	by the time that all this stuff is fixed and the final version of the game is
4243600	4248120	done, I mean, you probably have the standalone Daisy client, so no,
4248200	4251240	no one really cares. Right. I mean, some people cared cause they,
4251360	4254840	they bought the game, but unfortunately it's pretty terrible cause you know,
4254840	4257760	they never, they never said, Oh, Hey, this is like an alpha, you know,
4257760	4262320	they were releasing as a paid game. It just, it's really weird.
4262840	4266360	Uh, all righty. Well, um,
4266400	4269560	let's move on to something completely different that happened this week. You know,
4269560	4270840	this is a really slow news week.
4270840	4273040	Some of the stories you're going to hear tonight are actually from the week we
4273040	4274840	didn't have a show cause this past week,
4275640	4277800	if we were to, unless we're talking about steam sales,
4277800	4281480	in which case there was plenty of news on that. Well, we'll get to that. But um,
4281680	4285640	this was a big story that actually happened this week just a couple of days ago.
4285640	4290000	And you know, it's the end of an era of sorts. Um, PlayStation two,
4291000	4293640	no more. It's done. At least in Japan,
4293640	4297240	the PlayStation two has ceased shipping to Japanese retailers.
4297640	4301080	Once the current stock of PlayStation two is off the Japanese shelves,
4301120	4305040	it is gone. You know, it's the PlayStation two.
4305240	4308840	The console is literally about 13 years old. You know,
4308840	4312040	it's probably one of the longest lasting consoles out of any of them.
4312320	4313600	It's had a good life, you know,
4313600	4318000	but there's a lot of people this week that are like, Ooh, no more PS two.
4318680	4323040	But I mean, come on guys. There's plenty of them out there. I think the only cast,
4323120	4326640	I think the only reason this is actually sad is because not all the PlayStation
4326640	4329080	threes are backwards compatible. So what if I need,
4329120	4332600	what if my PlayStation two breaks and I need to get a new PlayStation two store?
4333040	4335920	I guess that's what you're going to have to do, right? I don't know eBay now.
4335960	4338160	And they don't say anything about the U S either,
4338160	4341080	but I don't think these are exactly easy to find in the U S as it is.
4341120	4344600	No, they don't. I don't. I mean, they still may sell some new PlayStation twos,
4344600	4347040	but I know that they're pretty much done with the games.
4347760	4351200	Damn you. Konami and pro Evo. So putting it on PS two, I mean,
4351200	4354760	that's really a final fantasy chains of anduin or whatever it's called. That's,
4354800	4357480	that's, remember we talked about that. That's the last PS two game is on.
4357520	4359280	Well, you know, that's nice Japanese,
4359320	4362200	although it would be interesting to see if they release it over here.
4362240	4366080	I don't think they did with, uh, wings of a goddess,
4366080	4368520	which was the last one that they had out.
4368800	4372760	I don't know if that came out over here. Maybe it did. I just don't remember.
4372800	4374880	It was a couple of years ago, but, um,
4375880	4380400	I it's had a good run. Yeah, I know. What can you, what else can you say? Like,
4380400	4383880	yeah. Oh wow. It's over. This is more just one of those damn.
4383880	4386440	I'm getting old moments because I look at this going,
4386520	4391000	I remember when this thing first came out and now they're no more. Right.
4391000	4395200	Jamie, I'm rolling my eyes as hard as I can. It may be audible.
4395480	4399040	Why? Because I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.
4399040	4402920	I was actually surprised they were still making PS two games for a while after
4402920	4406120	the PS three came out. I mean, yeah, I expected like maybe a year,
4406640	4409400	but how long has the PS three been out now? What, two years, three years,
4409400	4412320	something like that. Why? It's been more than that.
4413680	4417480	I'm just, I'm so completely not surprised. It's time for, you know,
4417480	4422360	but they're prepping for a next gen system and phasing out the,
4422440	4426200	it's almost exactly how it happened with the first PlayStation. Well, yeah,
4426200	4430280	it's just, there's no game sink coming out in PS two anymore. It doesn't matter.
4430760	4433600	The people who are going to have one have one, right?
4434240	4438000	I have a first model Japanese PlayStation two works just fine.
4438360	4439200	Don't need a new one.
4439560	4442920	I'm going to our chatters who are clarifying some of the Final Fantasy 11 issues.
4442920	4447160	A Shane Alinko says they already said no more Final Fantasy 11 PlayStation two
4447160	4450960	expansions in the U S Raginator says wings of the goddess did come out here,
4451480	4456480	but there won't be any more here in the U S which makes sense. So who cares?
4456840	4458560	It's just Final Fantasy 11 anyway. God damn.
4458560	4460160	There's a lot of newer games you can be playing.
4460440	4462000	I don't even know. Well,
4462000	4464200	and the other thing too is I don't even know if that,
4464240	4466400	couldn't they do it digitally? I mean,
4466400	4470080	I know they don't really have anything in sort of in place for PlayStation two,
4470080	4474240	but I mean, if you think about it, you could probably just download it.
4474240	4476720	Cause I know they have those three kind of micro expansions.
4476760	4478720	Those never really came out as a disc version,
4478960	4482720	but they could do something like that. Yeah. You could download it to the hard drive.
4482720	4483120	I don't know.
4483120	4487520	Damn. There's so many job classes I was not aware of. I was like, well dude,
4487920	4492480	what's all this? This is a scholar. I don't know. I'm smart guy.
4492480	4495160	That's really gonna fight off a goblin.
4495160	4497840	They're black mages and white mages. They're like gray mages,
4497840	4500640	but their thing is that they, they're a great sub job because they can,
4500760	4503480	you can do the, um, I forget what the skills call,
4503480	4506760	but it's basically you enhance your black magic and weaken your white magic or
4506760	4511240	vice versa. They're like a ying yang mage type of thing. So yeah, cool.
4511360	4514960	And now you know, and now I know and dancers are great for soloing in the,
4514960	4518880	in, in, in the end, most say, well, let's, let's,
4519120	4521120	let's get to level 20 first because shit,
4521200	4525160	I got to go do all that stuff solo now cause I'm not gonna be able to go back to
4525160	4528640	play Ragnarok online now. Cause retro is fun. Hey,
4528640	4530080	that's why I picked the Ragnarok server.
4530080	4533600	So it'd be easy for me to remember which one it was. Cause I had a Ragnarok.
4533600	4535520	Okay, cool. Yeah. Cause Bismarck's gone.
4535520	4537880	So I don't even know where the hell my character would be anyways,
4537880	4542280	even if I re did my old Bard black mage servers.
4542520	4546160	Yeah. Uh, Flaco, you have fond memories of the PlayStation too.
4546560	4550160	Yeah. And actually my wife and I were thinking about buying a slim a couple of
4550160	4554680	years ago. So we went to fries and you get, I had one, but I mean I have one,
4554840	4558000	but it was kinda, it's kinda flaky. It doesn't have a great video connection.
4558000	4561080	It doesn't play. Sometimes it cuts out in the middle of playing a game.
4561080	4564680	So it's dying and we, uh, she wanted to play Kingdom Hearts too.
4565200	4568440	And so I was like, well, we're at, we're at fries. Let's just see. What is it?
4568480	4572440	Like 20 bucks. It's still a hundred dollars two years ago at least.
4572640	4576040	Oh wow. I'm not paying a hundred dollars for a PlayStation two.
4576360	4578040	I saw one at the thrift store for 50.
4578280	4581800	It's honestly because these older devices, they don't price protect them.
4581800	4583760	So they're not going to drop the price cause they're losing money.
4583960	4586280	Cause when they bought them, there was no margin in it anyway.
4586280	4589120	So they're not going to eat, you know, 50 bucks on a console.
4589760	4592480	They're just going to let it sit there until someone's dumb enough to buy it for
4592480	4594280	that. I mean, that's why you gotta go secondhand.
4594400	4596880	Yeah. I mean, well I had a used one. That was my whole point. I was like,
4597240	4599440	but so we just hooked up the old one and it worked.
4599440	4602400	My wife beat Kingdom Hearts two again and all was good.
4602840	4605040	Well, I'm looking at Amazon and you know, they're,
4605040	4607200	they're a little scarce to find. I mean,
4607200	4609760	they're all from the secondhand sellers and uh,
4610400	4615400	$149 new or 130 new, but $50 used or 43 99 used.
4616240	4619880	So yeah, well mine held up. So that was good. But yeah, I was, I just didn't,
4619920	4622400	I had no idea it would be a hundred dollars.
4622400	4625720	I was thinking maybe 50 would be cool. I thought I was stupidly thinking,
4625720	4628640	you know, it should be 20 bucks cause who plays that anymore?
4629280	4631600	They need to amp up the backwards compatibility.
4631720	4636440	I wish they would just fricking do as much software backwards compatibility as
4636440	4638400	they can do. I mean, I realize not everything can be.
4638400	4641240	They're just going to sell them now. Ah, bastards. That's all they're doing.
4641640	4642920	Well, download games, right?
4643480	4647840	Maybe that they could sell some more VITAs by doing that. But all right, uh,
4648560	4650640	let's move on with some other news. Dark Sakura.
4651280	4655200	Well, as I was saying earlier, there are steam sales. Yay.
4656600	4660960	And I mean there's a crap load of sales. Um, there's daily sales,
4660960	4663200	flash sales, prolonged discounts.
4663480	4668080	You can basically see a game go on sale every 12 hours. Um,
4668120	4669400	not really joking at all.
4669800	4674720	They're doing like bundle sales like into like 75% off whole game series and
4674720	4679240	stuff and you can get steam alerts. And now, um, it's like,
4679240	4681840	uh, in fact I just had, um,
4681920	4686440	the steam site open just a moment ago, but they had, um,
4687360	4689000	hold on, say something, Rob.
4689080	4689640	I was just to say,
4689640	4692360	I wanted to check in with everybody on their steam casualties.
4692400	4694680	What have you given into on this sale so far?
4694680	4695980	I picked up, um,
4696040	4700720	limbo and closure and um, I picked up,
4700720	4705040	uh, what the crap game was that? Oh, Assassin's Creed two. Like I was saying,
4705960	4709160	um, Skyrim isn't on a good enough sale yet for me to justify it.
4709400	4712760	The Bioshock, um, franchise is on sale for 10 bucks.
4713080	4714160	Check Skyrim again.
4714160	4716920	It was the daily today or yesterday and that's as low as it's going to get.
4716920	4719480	And the Bioshock franchise, I'm not going to pay 30 bucks.
4719520	4722720	Bioshock franchise. Go Amazon. It's five bucks there.
4723960	4726080	Let's still play it through. Yeah, I hear far cry three.
4726080	4729560	You can get a better deal on some of the zombies game of the year edition is two
4729560	4733200	49 and seriously, if you haven't played that by now, then where,
4733240	4736720	what rock have you been under? Mass Effect two right now is five bucks.
4736720	4738600	Mm hmm. I, uh,
4738640	4742120	I bought Gianna sister's twisted dreams cause I wanted it anyway.
4742120	4743680	The Valve collection is 50 bucks.
4744320	4747600	That surprisingly is the only game I bought except I will say, uh,
4747640	4752480	Alan trying to get the achievement for getting the gift meta thing or getting
4752480	4754840	the meta, doing all little meta achievements for the holiday sale.
4754960	4758360	He gave me a gift of a little dollar 50.
4758360	4760200	I didn't know they had achievements for sale.
4760520	4762760	They do anything to get you to buy.
4763600	4765640	This is another game I'm actually kind of interested in.
4765880	4769240	It's another two 50 game. It's called the tiny bang story.
4769600	4772640	One of the indie games. It's,
4772680	4776760	it's got some looks like it's some neat puzzle elements in it too. Um,
4777720	4782480	but back on the mate, like critical mass postal, uh,
4782520	4785400	beat hazard. Uh, let's see,
4785400	4790400	I'm just trying to get the entire Indies super mega pack 30 games is 70 bucks,
4791960	4795000	which for all of that. Yeah. Um,
4795000	4799160	I will probably inevitably get dark souls again when it goes on like super sale.
4799680	4803800	The far cry franchise is 50 bucks. Not bad market. The Ninja eight bucks,
4804400	4807360	the Witcher eight, but which are two eight bucks. Flaco,
4807360	4808760	have you given in any of the sales yet?
4809960	4812520	I have not, but I already have a lot of those games.
4812520	4816840	I have limbo and I love Bioshock. I have those and, and uh,
4817200	4819560	and I got the humble bundle things. So I was like,
4819560	4823600	I don't need more games that I'm not going to play because I still need to hook a
4823600	4826360	computer up to my TV in the front room because I haven't had that since I
4826360	4830960	moved. Hey, instead of five, eight bucks, get that. Cause if five's great,
4831280	4834920	I don't really like the sub games, but other people can play them. I,
4834920	4837840	you know this about me, here's, here's, here's something.
4837840	4841220	If you want to get SIV five and some other games they have on Amazon.
4841220	4845040	See cause I've been doing Amazon because they've everything steam codes and you
4845040	4847480	can just redeem it over on steam and they're a little bit cheaper. Yeah.
4848080	4852400	Shop around for the best bargain. The two K mega pack, which is, um,
4852440	4857280	I think seven or nine games includes Bioshock to Bioshock borderlands game of
4857280	4861720	the year edition, SIV city, Rome, Duke Nukem forever, complete pack mafia twos,
4861720	4863800	SIV five game of the year edition,
4864200	4868600	SIV for the complete edition and the stronghold collection for 30 bucks.
4868760	4872560	I don't think I would even accept money to take Duke Nukem forever. Uh,
4872600	4875080	act deaf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
4875080	4877600	Loki check your profile and see the badges. That's,
4877600	4881120	that's where the holiday sale meta achievements and all that crap is.
4882120	4886120	Or don't, don't get suckered into that stuff. No. All right.
4886760	4890120	I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the little mini games this
4890120	4894920	year where it's like the little achievements within the games that were tied to
4894920	4897320	the holiday. Like they haven't done things like that since last year.
4897320	4899560	And I liked that. So like I remember last year they had the whole,
4899560	4902600	get the pieces of coal and then like you could trade up the coal and get the
4902600	4906160	games. I think that was so much better. But I guess, you know,
4906160	4909360	beggars can't be choosers. It's awesome. They're doing what they are as it is.
4909480	4914040	So, all right. Um, let's move on with some more news. Uh,
4914080	4916120	Loki, I think you're next. All right.
4916480	4921480	So let's talk a little bit about this thing called Disney infinity that we're
4921840	4924720	just hearing about for the first time. What is this Disney infinity?
4925440	4926720	But there's rumors.
4926920	4930720	It's apparently a new gaming initiative that's going to have something to do
4930720	4931520	with, uh,
4931840	4935340	this thing called toy box that is going to have Disney and Pixar characters
4935380	4939620	interacting in games across multiple platforms. And,
4940140	4943620	and it's also going to be like, you know, sort of like Skylanders.
4943620	4947180	And apparently they're going to tell us more about it in, um,
4947740	4951260	January. And also I guess it's going to be a sandbox game.
4951260	4954820	They're saying it's going to be similar to the toy box mode in toy story three.
4956300	4959720	Um, yeah, it's very interesting.
4959720	4962720	I wish we had more information about it as if like, you know,
4962720	4964880	we had some sort of document or something that, Oh,
4964880	4968960	what the hell is this that's in my lap here from like weeks ago that is under a
4968960	4973560	pile of cords and stuff. It's a document about Disney infinity. That's so weird.
4974080	4975400	So weird.
4977680	4978560	Let's see here.
4980600	4984380	Introducing a new game platform takes you to an infinite game possibilities and
4984380	4984800	beyond.
4984800	4988360	Imagine bringing together your favorite Disney and Disney Pixar heroes stories
4988360	4992000	and locations as toys to create your own unique customized environments,
4992000	4994480	adventures, and stories just the way you want them.
4994720	4998160	Now you can with Disney infinity, the possibilities are infinite,
4999200	5001880	but it sounds like the game itself may not be like, you know,
5001880	5003720	we know it's inspired by Skylanders,
5003720	5006000	the whole like real life figures and this whole thing,
5006120	5009640	but it's not that the game itself may not necessarily be Skylanders because
5009640	5011760	Skylanders is apparently very Diablo. Yeah.
5011760	5015600	I think it is going to be kind of more like the toy box mode because they're
5015600	5017880	talking about, okay, so some of the stuff that they're going to, you know,
5017880	5020520	be tying in with, it's mainly gonna be a lot of movie tie-ins and stuff.
5020520	5023840	So for example, since this game is supposed to be coming out around June,
5024840	5027700	you're going to have like the first few things, the monsters,
5027700	5030800	university Pixar's or cars.
5031520	5034960	I say they're doing cars, 3d or something like that. The lone ranger,
5036120	5039640	the Incredibles. I think that's also getting like a 3d treatment as well.
5039840	5042240	Toy story, parts of the Caribbean.
5043160	5045320	And they're saying the different types of things like they're going to have
5045320	5048240	gadgets, buildings, vehicles, environments, et cetera.
5051520	5055720	Basically the way they have it work is each character's got a character coins
5055720	5057880	and like a place at pieces and they kind of put,
5058120	5061320	they get put down on this reader and then when you put them on the reader,
5061320	5065000	it unlocks game content, but they are actual figures.
5065040	5066800	They're not there. They're their actual figures.
5066800	5071360	Actual reader is actually kind of the same shape as the infinity logo or the in
5071680	5076280	that they have in the infinity logo. It's like this weird like, yeah,
5076320	5080120	it's this weird, like uneven hexagon thing, um, that they've got there.
5080120	5084360	At least that's in the little, um, little thing. And yeah,
5084360	5088640	it's a apparently, yeah, it says open world, innovative game design,
5088640	5091320	triple a quality game, uh,
5091360	5094720	complete line of interactive game pieces supporting all platforms,
5095160	5100240	supports all T, uh, TWDC events. Um,
5102720	5106040	so yeah. Um, we, it looks like it'd be interesting. I mean,
5106720	5109560	more interesting as Skylars, that's for sure, but whatever.
5109600	5110840	Cause it's Disney and you know,
5111840	5116080	you know people are going to fucking eat this shit up and it's because, um,
5116760	5118920	it's, I mean, look at just like the crap that people come.
5118920	5121880	I'm a little worried about Flaco. Not only is he a Disney addict,
5121880	5125720	like the rest of us, but he has kids and he can justify, Oh, it's for the kids.
5125800	5129640	I know if my kids, if my kids want Skylanders, I'll be like, no,
5129880	5132920	but if you want something similar, you can get Disney. I'll be fine with that.
5132960	5137920	You know? So yeah, I mean, uh, it'll be interesting, but yeah.
5138200	5141360	Will you find an excuse to go to Disneyland just because they have a limited
5141360	5143640	edition character that you can only get like in the park?
5144200	5146880	Cause you know that shit's going to happen. I'll go anyway. I don't care.
5147400	5148040	Well anyways,
5148040	5151000	you'll be hearing it from the rest of the game blogs in January because they're
5151000	5153800	all sort of embargo or some bullshit, but you know what?
5154200	5155880	No fucking embargoes on this train
5159360	5162480	because no one shares information with us. All right. Fair enough.
5162760	5167760	It's just Disney infinity. It's not Fort Knox. We all know what's coming.
5168400	5172000	There it is. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's talk about,
5172040	5174760	let's go from Disney to talking about pornography, shall we?
5175960	5179640	Yay. Well, that's an easy segue. I'm suddenly reminded of this, this, uh,
5179640	5182320	GIF I saw of the wicked queen from snow white and she's,
5182560	5186000	she's holding this open box and she has the scowl on her face and the little
5186000	5190720	capture says, who put a dick in this box? That was awesome. Yeah, that's great.
5190880	5193280	Anyway. Uh, let's talk about porn. Uh,
5193320	5197920	porn found on a three DS and was traded into GameStop.
5199280	5201160	Oh boy. Yes. Uh, let's see.
5201160	5204840	This is actually a report from the daily mail. Uh, they got this,
5204840	5209840	I guess a refurbished Nintendo three DS had nine pornographic images on it and
5211040	5215120	was, uh, yet traded into GameStop. Oh wait, does this,
5215240	5217760	does this link to a local news story? It does.
5218520	5221560	I got to do that cause it looks like it's channel nine news here in the States.
5221560	5224280	Oh, I gotta find this. Where? Yes.
5225080	5228840	We get to hear sensationalist local news. I love sensations.
5229640	5233200	Let's hear sensationalist local news. Tell the story.
5233960	5238000	Who can take a small problem and just blow it way out of proportion.
5238480	5242440	Local news. We need a bumper for local news that just distorts everything.
5242440	5245280	All right, here we go. Local news on porn.
5247240	5249360	I don't want to hear zip ties.
5249360	5253600	I love zip ties. Tell me more blowing zip ties out of proportion.
5254200	5257040	Dude, did they have like a shop that's dedicated to zip ties?
5257040	5260520	Because that's fucking awesome. I want to know more zip ties.
5260520	5263600	Your long zip ties, your small zip ties, your colored zip ties.
5263600	5266160	You know what? What the hell? It's, it's apparently that's the city.
5266160	5270560	It's a store called a to Z and it has everything from
5272720	5273560	zip ties.
5273600	5277360	People who like work with a lot of chords and people who want to murder people.
5278320	5279520	All right. Local news time. Shut up.
5281200	5281800	New tonight,
5281800	5285440	a father from Lakewood had to return one gift that was given his son.
5285480	5287560	He says it traumatized his family.
5288000	5292920	The five year old boy found pornographic pictures on the refurbished game device
5292920	5294920	he got for Christmas. Nine news reporter,
5294920	5298400	Megan Fitzgerald joins us from the GameStop where the item was purchased.
5298400	5301480	Megan, the company says it's trying to make it right. Adele,
5301480	5304520	that's what they're saying. But the dad just does it. Wait, the reporter,
5304560	5308080	the, the lady's name is Adele. Is that, did I,
5308080	5310640	she's that fired their name. Did I hear that correctly?
5310640	5315280	Is the news lady's name Adele? You know, people are named Adele by the way.
5316080	5319760	Let's go outside the GameStop and watch this guy. Oh, watch.
5319920	5323600	See how that's possible since you can't just erase these images from his son's
5323600	5326960	brain, but the store behind me. But he's tried.
5329200	5332480	If the family, a brand new upgraded Nintendo 3d ass,
5332480	5334080	they also threw in some games in there,
5334080	5337440	but the dad says there's really no way to make this right.
5337440	5340760	He just wants to let other families know. So it doesn't happen to their kids.
5343800	5346600	When you're a kid, hands down the best.
5346600	5348480	That's the name of the electric buzzsaw, by the way,
5348480	5350560	trying to get into the kid's brain. I'm kidding. It's a toy tank.
5350640	5352880	Part about Christmas is jumping out of bed.
5353080	5356800	It's really exhilarating and seeing all the toys.
5358240	5359960	Especially when you're five.
5360000	5364560	And especially when you've been waiting all year round for that special toy.
5365120	5369560	I get a 3d. Yeah, you got a 3d. Yes, that's right. And these are some,
5369560	5372000	these are the pictures that we took this morning. There's Brayden,
5372120	5375200	but Wednesday morning, that excitement turned to horror.
5375440	5379840	He ended a 3d S to Brighton and Brian said, dad,
5380680	5382440	I don't think he should be looking at these pictures.
5383680	5386720	I don't think we should be looking at these pictures. It's just a DS.
5387040	5391000	It's not a 3d S. It's just exactly like a DS. You are five.
5391000	5393960	You shouldn't be looking at those pictures because don't you read the warning
5393960	5395880	that you're not supposed to play it when you're under seven or you're going to
5395880	5399080	go cross. Did you hear that? I said, dad,
5399720	5401840	this DS has porn on it.
5402520	5407320	And I handed him the DS and he just got up and are they all crying?
5407440	5412400	Hold on. Hold on. First world problems. First world problems. Hold on.
5412400	5415080	And the kid is crying. How does the kid know what porn is?
5415320	5420320	How does the first thing he said was this has porn on it and doesn't know what
5420440	5420760	porn is.
5420760	5423760	Because I would think that a five year old isn't probably going to know what
5423760	5428160	that stuff is and all those people are being silly expert, AKA a mom.
5428720	5430800	Does, does your son know what porn is?
5431720	5434800	Um, this whole thing really? I'm,
5434800	5439080	I'm allegedly in my opinion, this themes,
5439120	5442320	things seems like it's being set up for a lawsuit.
5443000	5445840	Yeah. Look good on camera guys. Make sure you're crying. And,
5445960	5448040	and they told the kid what to say. Cause yeah, yeah.
5448080	5450880	There's poured on the DS daddy. Hmm.
5451840	5454640	I'm asking Becky even fifth dream in chat.
5454640	5458800	Why does a five year old know what porn means to the phone? Oh, I lost it.
5459040	5461880	I, I just called everybody.
5465000	5465840	Really?
5466280	5470920	It was hard for Mark Giles as two young sons to see pornographic images on their
5470960	5472560	toy. Now look,
5472960	5477560	I get if somebody is like super religious or whatever and is offended by the
5477560	5481960	side of porn and so forth and just does and the fact that like a kid saw it,
5481960	5484560	because you know, as much as we're, we're laughing to have a good time with it,
5484680	5486840	it is fucked up that a kid, you know,
5486880	5490680	that didn't want to be subjected to it got subjected to it. But I'm sorry,
5490720	5493640	this is way over the top for me. But you know what? So here's not angry.
5493640	5494720	You know, it's even worse about it.
5494760	5497840	Hate the spoiled part of the story here that we're probably gonna get to here.
5498280	5499840	I think he said it was from Santa Claus.
5501920	5502760	Okay.
5505080	5508840	That was a gift from Santa Claus. There's another one.
5509480	5512840	I can't be mature about it. I can't be there. There's another one.
5512960	5516000	There was another one that I saw too that wasn't necessarily this,
5516000	5519400	but it was one of those where you buy stuff from Walmart as a returned item and
5519400	5522240	in the box instead of a 3ds it was rocks.
5523160	5527600	That's great. Okay. So I asked Becky for the sake of the show,
5527640	5531200	does Julian know what porn is? And I did at the end.
5532120	5536840	And she says no in big bold letters with four exclamation points and then
5536920	5540160	lol. But it was even harder for him.
5541640	5545680	And then I said, um, we know what was going on. And she said, weird.
5546560	5550720	So that's coming from a mom with a five year old just saying, all right, let me,
5550760	5555760	let me let these sensationalist local news courtesy of nine news finish up here
5556760	5560720	who tried so hard to make Christmas special about nine minutes,
5560760	5565440	nine images of a sexual activity on his
5565440	5569800	toy that he got from Santa that Santa got from GameStop.
5570200	5572000	So GameStop tried to make it right.
5572160	5576120	They told Giles the images were from a previous owner and they weren't caught
5576140	5578520	before the refurbished device was sold.
5578960	5581080	But you can't unsee this. He's five years old.
5581640	5585520	Now maybe when he's 18 or 20 and maybe he won't know anything about the kids are
5585560	5587000	hugging right now in the little,
5587000	5589920	they're showing a picture of the kids has no freaking clue what's going on,
5589920	5593320	comforting each other about this horrific imagery.
5593960	5595760	He's not going to forget about it tomorrow.
5597240	5598720	And the company wouldn't go on camera,
5598720	5601300	but the corporate office sent us the following statement.
5601300	5605560	It says GameStop is currently researching the situation.
5605740	5609720	We have a rigorous quality control process in place to ensure that existing
5609720	5614720	content is removed from all devices before they are resold out of millions of
5614840	5618200	transactions each year. One's like this happened very rarely.
5618480	5622080	Our number one priority is to make this right for our customers.
5622160	5626080	Degenerate Johnny in our chat room says ROFL Santa shops at the evil G
5628320	5631960	and an employee at the GameStop behind us told Giles that they're going to do
5631960	5635640	their own investigation to try and find out how this happened to Dell so that
5635640	5636960	they can make sure it doesn't happen again.
5637600	5640840	I'm kind of curious, Megan, is this type of a bulk eraser?
5640840	5644360	It would seem like that you would erase everything on every unit.
5645400	5646520	You would think so, Adele.
5646520	5649960	In fact the father was saying that there was a SIM card that easily could have
5649960	5653080	just been removed that would have, uh, erased all of these images.
5653120	5654760	But unfortunately that wasn't the case.
5655040	5657720	Of course we weren't going to show those images because they were very
5657720	5660880	graphic. But again, the company is saying that they,
5661080	5662680	they try and catch things like this,
5662680	5665960	but this one obviously slipped through the cracks obviously. All right,
5665960	5667160	Megan distro. Thanks Megan.
5668600	5671840	Really? Really? They're going to launch an investigation to it. Like, Oh,
5671840	5675800	some dickhead forgot to like erase this thing is with the way that GameStop
5675800	5679720	functions. Probably half that store is fired because they'll know seriously.
5679720	5682880	You're right. Probably because they fire their employees.
5682920	5686280	They make up shit to fire their employees over. I'm not lying.
5686360	5689160	I don't think that, I don't think that that story to get fired. Cause anything,
5689200	5692880	any systems that they take back for refers to get sent away to this is,
5692880	5696280	there's a reason why there's a reason why they're called evil G Loki.
5696640	5700960	They fire people for the tiniest of little reasons. I know people personally,
5701960	5703280	why do you think my husband quit?
5704120	5708120	Act deft in our chat room says they could have had the porn,
5708640	5712880	but they're rolling in the deep. All right, forget it. Look, I, it is a,
5712880	5716240	it is a crappy situation. I think that is way over the top.
5716280	5719560	The way everybody's reacting. It's like, okay, you know,
5719800	5724320	it's obvious what happened. It is wrong. GameStop should say, Hey, whoops,
5724320	5728400	we didn't erase this one. You know, but at the same time, I kind of wonder like,
5729360	5730960	how did,
5732600	5736680	did the parents not think to look first before handing the system to their five
5736680	5737240	year old? I mean,
5737240	5740240	he says I went to go take the picture and I handed it to the five year old.
5740360	5742800	How did, I'm trying to think like in having used the DS,
5742800	5746040	how did he not see the pictures first then? So I don't get,
5746080	5747200	you're the parents in the room.
5748320	5751520	My kid would not know what porn is when he's five.
5751520	5755120	And I don't think you even know what he was looking at. What's that?
5755800	5758360	Exactly. I think that's what happened. That's why mine have happened.
5758360	5761080	And then he decided, Oh, I'm going to get a case going.
5761080	5763720	So this is what you say to the reporters kids,
5764000	5767280	because I feel like the kids know what he saw in my opinion, in my opinion.
5768760	5772720	This is what I think as I honestly think that it's parents thinking other people
5772720	5777480	are doing their due diligence for them. Honestly, they say, Oh,
5777720	5781280	it's coming in. We believe that, you know, we're not going to check.
5781280	5783720	We wouldn't think about this. You know, if they were,
5783720	5785680	if it was something that they were truly worried about,
5786040	5788480	then they would have gone through it to begin with.
5788520	5790920	And let's be honest, this is a 3DS camera, man. I'm luck.
5791000	5794520	He's lucky to even know what's going on there because that camera is such a
5794520	5798000	piece of shit that like, you'd be like, what is that? That there,
5798040	5800080	I don't even know what's going on, man.
5800560	5804400	Those two blobs are really close to each other. I mean, it's just, who knows?
5804560	5807400	I just remember hearing from my little brothers,
5808400	5810480	mommy and daddy are wrestling again.
5811320	5816280	Or, or, or even better, you know, if they did shoot it very well, you know,
5816280	5817240	it's like, Oh my God,
5817280	5820680	it's like my eyes are literally being raped by the penis coming out and taking
5820680	5824960	3d. All right. Look, a tiger call in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
5824960	5827040	GameStop needs to double check their stuff.
5827320	5831040	I don't think any of us are doubting that, but you know, and I'm not,
5831120	5833960	I'm not exactly like giving them a break, but it's like,
5833960	5837680	I see how this happened. Christmas rush. Someone got lazy.
5837840	5841320	It slipped through. Doesn't make it right. But that's what happened clearly.
5841400	5846080	Or sometimes if you use, um, a mass, um, formatter for a card,
5846480	5850000	I've seen it happen where even for, um, camera and phone Sims, they'll,
5850120	5852560	they won't do shot better. Yeah.
5852560	5855480	What about the guy that returned that in the first place? I mean, don't you,
5855520	5858640	I mean, honestly, if it was me returning something, I wouldn't be like, Hey,
5858640	5861280	I'm gonna pull my porn on there and leave it on there. You know,
5861280	5864840	it's just like, you know, when I sold my 3ds on eBay,
5864880	5866960	I erased all the porn that I had on there.
5867920	5871400	Not anything that I actually photographed, but like you can download, you know,
5871400	5873840	stuff that actually goes on your card that has, you know,
5873840	5874880	picture sets and stuff like that.
5874880	5878920	People shot with professional 3d cameras that aren't shit like the, you know,
5878920	5879800	3ds cameras.
5879800	5882800	I think this is a good point that shadow next gen says in our chat room, uh,
5882800	5885480	Walmart does a worse job than GameStop.
5888640	5891720	It's probably very true. Uh, you know,
5891720	5894440	a company that doesn't specialize in game, you know,
5894440	5896560	they have a game department, but they don't specialize in games.
5896760	5899360	It's probably far more likely to make that mistake. Uh,
5899400	5902720	act deft closing up the story saying that kid should feel privileged.
5902720	5907640	He had 3d porn. He just didn't realize it yet. I do all the time.
5907840	5910920	He's observing the future. Speaking of Nintendo porn,
5910920	5915880	a good segue for me to mention this, a porn app coming to the Wii U sugar DVD.
5916080	5919880	They offer unlimited adult TV streaming on the PlayStation three iPad,
5919880	5921320	Xbox three 60 and so forth.
5921520	5925080	They've announced that they're bringing their app to the Wii U unlimited
5925120	5928600	streaming porn straight to the game console, seven 95 a month.
5928600	5930560	And you're probably thinking, wait a minute, how did they do this?
5930560	5933120	Like I don't know this porn app on the PS three and so forth.
5933560	5936000	It's launched through the web browser.
5937440	5939720	So in other words, that's not much of an app.
5939760	5944160	It's a website that you pay for to just get it formatted.
5944160	5947720	It's like, oh, things in app to be fair.
5947720	5951040	It it's probably looking at the user agent and stuff like that and formatting
5951040	5954320	to their site. Cause I actually have the sugar DVD app on. Uh,
5954360	5958560	it was course you do. No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Let, let me be clear.
5958640	5962360	Let me be clear. I don't pay for porn. Okay. So, okay.
5962360	5965000	So I had the app on, it came, you know,
5965000	5969200	it's part of the repository for the boxy. Um, and so they have it, you know,
5969200	5971560	and of course I downloaded all the porn apps and seen, you know, I was like,
5971560	5976640	ah, got paid for this. Fuck that. Delete. But, um, you know, they had it.
5976640	5978760	And so, yeah, a lot of it's thing with the boxy,
5978760	5981920	the way the boxy works is it's just, you know, websites, uh,
5981960	5985960	formatted for those devices. So yeah, I mean,
5985960	5989440	I could see that they would do that. Um, and of course, Nintendo go, oh,
5989440	5991960	we don't officially do this. By the way,
5991960	5995840	the internet Explorer browser on the three 60 sucks for viewing porn.
5996480	5999920	Just saying porn reviews by Loki. You're on,
6000600	6003440	you got to know which browser is good because it doesn't support flash.
6003440	6008040	Who the fuck doesn't support flash nowadays? All right, uh,
6008520	6010520	let's go to dark Sakura. We're already,
6010520	6012280	we're almost to two hours for party alone.
6012280	6016680	Let's try to run through the rest of the work until 1130 tomorrow. Right. Um,
6017560	6020560	to work on new year's Eve. That sucks. Yeah, but my boss won't be there.
6020720	6024760	No, that's money. Yeah, money. That's, that's the thing. Money. Um, so anyway,
6025360	6028040	well we've been talking and talking about this and I knew it was going to
6028040	6032160	happen and I'm so happy steam for Linux beta is out. Yes.
6032520	6036760	And I happen to be running Linux. I'm going to test it out.
6037720	6039880	Um, basically all you have to do is, um,
6039920	6041720	if you don't already have a steam account,
6041720	6046320	you can install and register and you're in so anyone can be there.
6046320	6051240	There's 39 games on there right now. Um, killing floor, um,
6051280	6053800	the book of unwritten tales and amnesia are there
6055320	6058160	and I'm actually trying to see if, uh,
6058760	6062880	I can get into the site there to see what else is on.
6063240	6066520	But I mean still, you know, it's a start.
6066520	6070880	I think that's actually really cool and I like Linux.
6071440	6076120	I may, uh, not have to keep using a PC anymore.
6078000	6080840	So yeah, if you're interested in it, just play and you know,
6080840	6082840	what's great is that steam big picture thing.
6082840	6086520	It really does kind of just make it look like an Xbox is great. Hmm. 3d deck.
6089360	6094360	How could you talk about that? I'm traumatized.
6095360	6096920	I'm going to see boobs.
6100440	6101960	I could say the sea bomb.
6103080	6106640	Did you notice also when he said when they found that I called everybody I could
6106640	6109800	think of. Yeah. The news,
6109960	6113920	your lawyer is no games.
6115440	6120000	But I did make sure to transfer the pictures before we gave it back. Stop.
6120040	6120880	All right,
6121600	6126000	let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a GameStop near
6126000	6126820	you.
6130520	6134840	Boobies 3d. Not a damn thing. Nothing in the U S this week.
6134920	6138360	Nothing in the U S nothing for people to spend their gift certificates on.
6138360	6139400	Huh? Steam sale.
6142240	6145240	That's the savior of gamers. That's all you get this week. Nothing new.
6145240	6148440	It's just all steam stuff until, um, till the eighth,
6149280	6152680	uh, going to Japan and checking out the releases there.
6152920	6156720	Xbox three 60 nothing. PlayStation three,
6157280	6160040	nothing. PlayStation Vita. Nothing.
6160040	6162640	The games don't start really coming in again until January 17th.
6162640	6166840	It looks like actually, uh, looking at the Wii U nothing.
6167000	6168720	God doesn't look like there's hardly anything coming out.
6168920	6172240	Yeah, exactly. Uh, uh, yeah,
6172280	6174480	it looks like it is totally dry in Japan as well.
6174480	6177880	So enjoy the games you have right now. I do notice though,
6177880	6182080	there is on PlayStation two Neopets, the darkest fairy. Oh,
6182080	6185560	that's a Europe game. It's a Europe game.
6185560	6188760	That snuck my way onto the Japanese releases. All right. How about,
6188840	6189720	how about Europe?
6189920	6193720	Nothing until the 11th, but one of them's a Wii U game. Rob.
6193880	6198000	What's that? Ninja Gaiden three. Okay. Ninja Gaiden three.
6198000	6201560	Why did I even say it wrong? I don't know. I don't know. I was thinking of porn.
6201560	6202400	Yeah.
6203960	6204800	Three cock.
6204840	6208080	We were at target just a couple of days before Christmas and uh,
6208080	6212160	they had like 12 we use there. That's just the one up in Yuba city.
6212440	6215640	A tower of fries. Yeah, they're everywhere. And yeah,
6215640	6216640	they don't ship any to us.
6216680	6221000	It's everywhere. 1200 on back order with Nintendo.
6221400	6224040	They ship us 12. You know, it would have fuck them. You know,
6224040	6228640	it would have sold them Africa, Tokyo jungle.
6229640	6232400	All right. I need, I still need to play that. Uh,
6232440	6235280	Loki myself have some stories and we're going to go to the last game of the
6235280	6238480	week. Loki. Uh, see here.
6238560	6240960	So this is kind of interesting. You know,
6241000	6245480	there was that documentary about Minecraft called the story of Mojang and is a
6245480	6246520	two player productions.
6247120	6251320	They decided to go ahead and beat the Russian upload at the pirate bay
6251320	6255960	themselves. So they, um, uploaded the pirate bay. Um,
6256160	6259480	people can download it for free. They kind of, you know, said, Hey, listen,
6259880	6260760	you know, we wanted to be,
6261120	6264280	we wanted to come here first because we knew the movie would eventually end up
6264280	6268320	here. And the best thing to do that seems to be opening a dialogue,
6268320	6272080	torrents and piracy are way of life and it probably won't be going away anytime
6272080	6275760	soon. And there are many people that want to punish you for that,
6275760	6280800	but we have more realistic outlook on things. And they basically said, you know,
6281280	6282440	if you download it, you know,
6282440	6284520	we're just three guys trying to make a living on what we're doing.
6284520	6286760	We love the world of video games and we love making it real.
6286960	6288880	If you buy the movie, you support those efforts.
6288880	6292640	The reason we kickstarted this movie in the first place was that we didn't have
6292640	6294040	enough money to make it ourselves.
6294040	6297360	Even then we still put a lot of our own money into it.
6297400	6299960	So they're just hoping that, you know, people do buy it.
6300880	6302040	You know, I did play Minecraft.
6303320	6305560	Fantastic. And you know, it's ironically enough,
6305600	6309600	I did not play Minecraft this week. Really? Well, I, I actually,
6309600	6312680	I think I went in for a little bit cause I was fixed last week.
6312720	6317280	I was fixing the servers cause I had screwed up the permissions by not installing
6317280	6320080	the permissions client. So I kept changing the config file. I was wondering,
6320280	6324400	why the fuck is nothing changing then? Oh, I forgot to reinstall it.
6324960	6329040	That's funny. You know, so I was trying to do that install flans mod,
6329040	6331040	but flans mod may not be coming.
6331040	6336040	I really wanted it to happen cause that's planes, cars and guns.
6336600	6340760	But so I can shoot one of those scary gray guys with the bow and arrow in the
6340760	6344160	face. Yeah, you can do that now.
6344320	6347080	But I'm talking about actually guns like AK47s.
6348840	6353760	I, my, my little girl, cause I failed to skin for her, um,
6353760	6357000	is making herself, um, a prairie dog town to live in.
6357120	6360400	I'm surprised you didn't find like a shepherd model for your Minecraft
6360400	6362720	character. I'm going to make one. I'm Zangief.
6363640	6366880	Mine's just like some whatever girl one is, but I'm making a shepherd for mine.
6367280	6372000	I did manage to update what I have. I'm doing the vog-minecraft.com.
6372000	6376320	Actually has, it has a WordPress thing installed on it.
6376320	6379480	I haven't bothered to update yet. I'm like starting so many projects.
6379480	6382400	I have another project that may be 2013 that I'm not really going to talk about
6382400	6384920	right now, but hopefully it'll be interesting. But, uh,
6385480	6387440	the website is another thing I want to update.
6387440	6391640	So eventually I'll get around to that. But yeah. Um, let me ask,
6391640	6394640	let me go back to the story about leaking your own damn film onto the pirate
6394640	6396080	bay. Let me ask our film guy.
6397760	6401480	Obviously piracy is a bit of a problem in Hollywood, right? Yes. Um,
6401480	6404400	especially when you talk about other countries, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah.
6404400	6405600	It's a much bigger over there.
6405600	6408800	You can go to another country and just get any movie you want. Really.
6408800	6412040	You can probably go to the theater and see a movie that was pirated. Probably.
6412080	6415000	Yeah. Uh, what do you think about uploading your own movie to the pirate bay?
6415960	6419840	I don't think it's a bad idea for a movie like this because what other exposure
6419840	6420560	are they going to get?
6420560	6424160	Maybe a lot of documentaries sign Netflix deals and I don't know how that works.
6424160	6426320	I don't know how the money transaction works,
6426320	6430080	but if these guys put it up on the pirate bay and they put like, like Loki said,
6430080	6434000	a message on there saying, Hey, please give us money. People might donate to that.
6434040	6436920	The guilt thing. What is it? It's not even really a guilt thing.
6436920	6439960	It's more of like, you know, Hey, you know,
6440000	6441840	they're actually coming out and saying, Hey,
6441840	6444320	it's almost like you if they did the pay what you want model,
6444320	6447040	which actually probably would have been a better way to do it. But you know,
6447040	6448680	once again, people are always going to pirate stuff.
6449000	6453920	They did some similar with McPixel was a game that got put onto the pirate bay
6453960	6455920	and he actually,
6455920	6459280	he uploaded it to the pirate bay and basically said, okay, you know,
6459360	6461680	we're going to do this. You know, you pay me what you want for it.
6461680	6465320	I think it's worth $5, but you know, you tell me what you,
6465440	6469880	what you think it's worth and you pay me that or nothing. And so I,
6469960	6472960	from what I remember, I think he made actually quite a bit of money from that.
6473000	6477440	Um, you know, it turned out very well and I think that's kind of the way it seems
6477440	6477920	like, you know,
6477920	6480600	a lot of these pay what you want things like the humble bundles and stuff do
6480600	6483840	really well and they get probably a lot more money than they would have if they
6483840	6486120	try to sell everything individually. Um,
6486120	6489440	act depth in our chat room at live.vog network.com says it's not guilt.
6489480	6494520	It's supporting something you like. Fair enough. And, and I haven't watched it,
6494520	6496400	but the trailer looked really good for it. I mean,
6496400	6498320	it looked like a pretty awesome documentary. It's nice.
6498400	6501880	I still need to watch the indie game movie from the humble bundle that I have.
6501960	6506520	I wanted to watch that anyway. So, Hmm. All right, well, uh,
6506560	6509640	let me get one more story here for you guys and we'll get to the classic game of
6509640	6513200	the week. But, um, you know, the Wii U game tank tank tank,
6513200	6514640	which actually is based on an arcade game,
6515880	6518480	which is funny that you're so excited about it because the games were getting
6518480	6520720	shit reviews left and right. Like people do not like it.
6520720	6523120	I don't care about the Wii U when I care about the arcade one,
6523120	6523960	which is awesome.
6525120	6525720	But you know,
6525720	6528800	I guess trying to sell an arcade game for 60 bucks like that,
6528800	6530800	like something you're used to playing a quarter for and getting your,
6530800	6533320	or maybe a little quarter. Yeah. This day and age,
6533360	6536640	four quarters for to get your five minute throw and then you're done with it.
6536800	6540080	You know, trying to get somebody to pay 60 bucks. That might be asking a lot. Um,
6540160	6542400	and I guess in Japan it hasn't been selling well.
6542680	6547040	Here's kind of an interesting thing that Namco is doing. This is only Japan,
6547240	6547920	but who knows?
6547920	6550520	It could happen here because I don't think it's selling that any better here.
6551000	6555200	Tank tank tank is now free to play in a way.
6555200	6556680	It's kind of a different type of model.
6556840	6560880	You download the upgradeable demo in the Japanese Nintendo eShop.
6561280	6563960	So what you can do if you're in Japan, you download this demo,
6563960	6567240	you get the basic action game for free. It has multiplayer.
6567440	6571080	You can do the city map free for all team battle giant monster,
6571280	6575160	but if you download the free version, you can only play it three times a day.
6575400	6576840	That restriction is removed.
6576840	6579680	If you purchase any download content for the game,
6580000	6582680	if you want to get more parts of this upgradeable demo,
6582920	6585920	you have to get these offered download contents in the game.
6586880	6591160	This is very iPhone. The way this is working out here,
6591480	6596120	like the, all it is the whole playing it three times daily.
6596360	6600720	That's your little three energy pills. And if you want more energy pills,
6600720	6603440	go buy them on the store or whatever. Like this is just,
6603480	6608480	this is literally the iPhone pricing model on a launch
6608480	6611720	title for the game. Now in the Nintendo Wii U shop. Very interesting.
6611720	6615920	I'm a little cautious with Namco doing it because remember Ridge Racer on the
6615920	6618800	Vita and how wonderful that was, you know?
6618840	6621360	Well, you kind of hope that maybe they learned something from that whole
6621360	6621520	experience.
6621520	6625120	I certainly hope so because God, that was,
6625520	6630040	that was a fucking mess. Um, but Tang Tang Tank's pretty awesome.
6630040	6630920	But yeah, looking at,
6630920	6633600	I can see why the reviews haven't been that good on it because it seemed like
6633600	6637120	the game was very limited as what they, what they're offering.
6637360	6640720	Cause I mean in an arcade game it would be, it makes sense that, okay,
6640880	6644960	you get like maybe an hour of entertainment out of it if you're really playing a
6644960	6648200	lot of money into it. But you know, this is a console game,
6648280	6650080	so you've got to have a lot more to it.
6650120	6654600	Otherwise you're going to get really bored. Um, so I don't know.
6654600	6658800	It's, which reminds me, I need to really go back and play a, that was it,
6658840	6662720	uh, say a gun game. Uh,
6663720	6665880	what was that called? I don't remember now.
6666440	6667560	Say good gun game. Yeah.
6667560	6671240	There is a Sega gun game that I was really raving about a while back. It's an old,
6671280	6674560	uh, it's not, not super old. It's not one of the virtual games. It's uh,
6675960	6680040	God, I can't fucking remember now. It's just a really wacky game. Um,
6680800	6684000	all right, well maybe somebody in chat will read your mind. Um,
6684040	6688160	but I think this makes a very interesting sort of compliment to the last story
6688160	6691080	you talked about. I mean they may not be putting tank tank tank up on the pirate
6691080	6693760	bay, but essentially they're putting it on a place where they're saying, Hey,
6693760	6697720	download it for free and let's see what happens because I bet you a lot more
6697720	6700040	people now will play tank tank tank go squad.
6700060	6703080	It was the game I was thinking of pretty cool. It's, but see,
6703080	6705800	that game has a lot of replay. I mean it's a very short game,
6705800	6708840	but you unlock weapons and the weapons increase the difficulty.
6708840	6713120	And so it was fun. Let's go back to my point though, is that, you know,
6713160	6716160	way more people are going to play this game than probably would have before.
6716160	6720440	Right? Yeah, because now it's free and so are basically checking out and there's
6720440	6723760	going to be maybe a handful of people like, Oh yeah, this is kind of fun.
6724080	6727120	And I probably wouldn't have bought this, but you know what?
6727120	6729440	And even though the three times,
6729440	6732160	I understand why they're limiting the gameplay cause they're giving you quite a
6732160	6736280	bit of the game and that seems kind of lame even though it is a demo and stuff.
6736520	6739880	But I understand why they're doing that. But at the same time, it's,
6740720	6742640	it's kind of cool that they are offering that.
6742640	6745040	So a lot more people can actually check out the game.
6745680	6749880	A fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says these days wait three
6749880	6753360	months to buy a game and you can spend the same amount to get the add ons.
6753440	6757640	They're like $60 worth of costumes and DOA five worth.
6757680	6760920	That's how much they cost. So not worth that.
6761200	6764160	I did that for, um, puzzle bobble on iPhone.
6764920	6765880	It just saying,
6766240	6769760	and also the three times a day is way better than when they limit it to like 30
6769760	6773400	plays done. You know, that type of thing. Rayman legends.
6773440	6776040	Haven't forbid if they did that to the Nino Cooney demo. I mean,
6776080	6777680	Flaco would have worn it out by now.
6778440	6779480	I already have worn it out.
6781800	6784920	All right, so there you go. Tank tank tank going free to play in Japan.
6784920	6787200	Who knows? Keep an eye on the news that that could happen here.
6787400	6790480	Especially if they have success with it in Japan. We'll see. All right,
6790480	6793600	let's travel back to a time when you know what? There was no free to play.
6793600	6798600	You, you paid the 50, 60 bucks for this game and either you liked it or F you.
6801400	6805800	Yay. I'm in chat. Oh, did, did the G line get lifted? Yeah.
6805800	6809000	That's been an hour. We should be able to safely reconnect to chat.
6810840	6814760	All right. Someone tell, no, we can't all five do it. No, I mean,
6818760	6821320	that's all right. I'll just be on my phone. My phone. Fine.
6821560	6826560	The classic name of the week is Jairus.
6830440	6833520	You mean I have a YouTube of it. I know, but I always have to,
6835680	6836760	it's so freaking cool.
6844440	6845280	I love this game.
6851320	6855440	You know, play to cut and you can be minor Rob one. Exactly.
6859800	6864560	So Jairus is a shoot him up game that if you've
6864560	6866040	played, um, Tempest,
6866080	6871040	you may find the game play style very familiar because you go in a circle.
6872640	6877360	It was the last game that Yoshiki Okamoto did for Konami. Um,
6877400	6879800	the first one being time pilot and, um,
6879840	6883520	he was fired after the game was released and he went to doing Capcom where he
6883520	6885080	gave us, Oh,
6885280	6890080	just a couple of little obscure titles like 1942 and street fighter,
6890880	6895560	you know? So, um, this one basically you're moving around in a circle,
6895800	6900800	hence I guess Jairus and shooting things as they come from the background to
6900920	6902340	the foreground. Like I said,
6902340	6906760	I'm again comparing it to Tempest because I think that Tempest was, uh,
6907440	6911400	definitely inspired by that. So, um,
6911960	6914680	and also, like I said, that it actually, um,
6914720	6917920	does play an arrangement of Takata and Fuegan D minor,
6918640	6923440	which I'm sure the Vanessa Mae fans in chat recognize that one from her version
6923440	6927240	of it, if not, you know, actually paying attention to classical music, you know?
6927880	6931120	So, um, it was, uh,
6931520	6934520	actually using stereo sound and, um,
6934600	6937520	in the bonus material that's for the Konami arcade classic,
6937800	6941480	they said that they used it by, um, using different, um, audio circuits.
6941880	6942920	The game was, uh,
6942920	6946520	used a multi-core processor that had two Z80 microprocessors,
6946840	6950680	a 6809 microprocessor and an 8039 microprocessor.
6951240	6956160	For the sound, it used an AY3-8910 PSG sound chip and a DAC.
6956880	6959000	For those who are into the technical side of it.
6960280	6963680	So again, it's a cylinder,
6963680	6966440	you shoot stuff when they come at you, you've got, you know,
6966720	6970040	swirly things that come at you. Um, if, uh,
6970080	6972480	you don't get the enemies in time,
6972880	6974120	the enemies that you have are satellites,
6974120	6976120	asteroids and laser beam generators,
6976160	6980720	and they just show up and some of them disappear if you don't shoot them first.
6981840	6985960	So, uh, for, uh, other things you have with the asteroids,
6985960	6989120	they actually fly out from the center, um, relatively, you know,
6989120	6993440	regularly and you still have to shoot them. Then you actually get, um,
6994360	6994880	a, uh,
6994880	6998480	you have to like make it to different planets as you're going through the
6998480	7003040	different stages. So you'll, um, like at first it says two warps to Neptune's,
7003040	7006520	you have to go through a warp and each warp is your stage. And then, um,
7006600	7007920	after you land on the planet,
7007960	7011920	you get a bonus round where you have to shoot different ships for bonus points,
7011920	7014480	kind of like, um, Galaga or Galaxian.
7015400	7019200	And you basically go through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and finally Earth,
7019640	7022440	where you've got three warps to get to each planet. Stage one,
7022480	7024200	and every 10th stage afterwards,
7024200	7027240	the enemies will not fire on you when you enter the screen.
7027320	7030680	Guess what the video just said? What? One warp to Uranus.
7034720	7037880	So as far as its arcade release, um,
7037960	7041720	it had an upright and cocktail cabinets, cocktail machines are the best I swear.
7042520	7047000	It, um, saved the high scores in RAM. Um,
7047040	7050280	but there was a mod kit that was released on August 22nd, um,
7050320	7054680	2003 that would save the top five scores after the machine was powered off.
7054680	7056480	So you could actually save the score machine.
7057080	7060600	That would be a great name for a video game blog. Three warps to Uranus.
7061960	7064240	I'm sorry. Patent pending.
7066080	7067480	Jairus was, um,
7067520	7068120	if we ever,
7068120	7070640	if we ever go our separate ways and have to make new podcasts,
7070640	7073280	my next podcast can be called three warps to Uranus.
7075480	7077880	Jairus was ported to different early systems.
7077880	7082560	There was a version on Atari, 2650, 200, which I think I've got that one.
7082920	7087600	The, um, Atari eight bit, the Commodore 64 Rob and the clique of vision.
7088200	7092040	Can we hear the awesome Commodore 64 SID chip version of Takata?
7092120	7094280	I guess as long as we can go back to the old one.
7094440	7095280	Yes.
7103000	7106600	Wait. Oh, that wasn't the full thing. Hold on. Look at that. Oh man.
7106600	7109400	The Commodore 64 version of this is so good. Why is the light flickering?
7109400	7110240	Is that concerning?
7121880	7125760	This is the version I play. It's like nonstop. I love this game.
7131560	7135880	Okay. Sorry. Play the remix. Remember that showed up in, um,
7136360	7139080	beat mania. I can do that. I was going to do that during the break. Okay.
7139080	7141760	We'll just do it in break. That means everyone's still listening to the break.
7142480	7143640	Okay. Um,
7143880	7147440	there wasn't a support version that was basically a very faithful arcade
7147440	7151480	reproduction. Um, it actually has some changes,
7151480	7155160	but the really faithful version came up with the economy arcade classics for
7155160	7159320	PlayStation and the economy collector series at arcade advance for Game Boy
7159320	7163400	advance. There are different bootleg versions. There's one called Venus.
7164400	7169400	Um, there is a one called Enu that was done by Italian hackers,
7169480	7173360	which I guess it had more scooters, more Vespas,
7173360	7174560	and people going chow.
7180640	7184280	They are working on trying to, uh, restore versions on main.
7185080	7187360	So, um, there's actually,
7188160	7192400	and this is what pisses me off about how awesome everything came out on the
7192400	7194880	Famicom desk system. Uh,
7194960	7199960	Jairus was one of the games that was a Famicom desk and it had a neat looking
7201080	7205640	logo, had the Konami logo over the top and it had spaceship and earth and
7205640	7206480	everything.
7206600	7211280	And then ultra games brought out a version that was kind of, but,
7212560	7213400	um,
7214960	7217520	I think it was, but I thought it was pretty good for an NPS.
7217760	7219680	I'm talking about logo Rob. Oh,
7220520	7224440	but what happened though with it is it updated the graphics. Um,
7224800	7229280	the music in the arcade version was from the arcade version was slightly
7229280	7231880	remixed. There were additional tracks. Um,
7231880	7234320	you start off with three warp synapse instead of two warps.
7234320	7237440	You get a super phaser attack instead of with the normal gun. Sorry.
7237800	7240840	You have extra enemies, boss fights, bonus stages,
7241240	7245600	an ending to the game and in the nest version it says something about the
7245600	7248960	universe being at peace. Um, in the Famicom desk system,
7248960	7252560	you get a full ending sequence. How's that? Um,
7252640	7257400	you've got 39 looping stages instead of the 24 and um,
7257640	7260560	on the nest version you actually play through the entire solar system,
7260800	7265000	including the sun and Pluto. The Konami code will work for extra lives.
7265000	7269200	However you have to enter it in reverse. So a, b, a, b, right, left, right, left,
7269200	7273240	down, down, up, up instead of the, you know what happens? A bit of trivia.
7273280	7277560	If you do the regular Konami code in Proteus, it kills you. Yeah,
7277800	7280680	I think it does. If you do it in reverse, then you do it gyro style.
7280680	7284240	I think it does that in, um, um, Gradius four, I think.
7284880	7287400	Yeah. Um,
7287440	7292120	that version of the game is also included in the Majesco, um, TV game, Konami,
7292160	7296520	uh, collector series, not the, um, Game Boy advanced ones.
7296760	7301080	So as far as other modern versions come out, like I said, there were, um,
7301120	7303920	the Game Boy advanced version, the PlayStation one. Um,
7303920	7306320	you can get it on, um, Xbox live arcade.
7306440	7309520	It's a tiger, tiger con chat. It says they should remake gyrus,
7309520	7313120	like same gameplay style, but HD graphics. I'm like, it's on Xbox.
7315000	7315840	You might've missed it.
7316160	7319480	So is for anyone who's interested in other games that I've covered,
7319560	7324840	our type is available that way. And it's really fun. Um, also,
7325480	7326120	um,
7326120	7331120	there's a clone of the game that exists as a mini game in Grand Theft Auto,
7331160	7335480	San Andreas. And like we've mentioned earlier, dance dance revolution,
7335480	7338320	ultra mix two, there is a gyrus, a remix,
7338880	7341480	and it's also available on in,
7341680	7346680	in game room for Xbox 360 and windows based PCs. So there you go.
7348800	7352640	Gyrus, there it is folks by the person who gave us street fighter.
7353000	7356080	I do have a, like a sort Konami side story based on that.
7357920	7359440	Oh, it was just, um, we,
7359440	7363000	we have our little weekly meetings and they talk about upcoming games that we're
7363000	7367320	going to come into the test and one of them was time pirate and we're like time
7367320	7372520	pirate. What's that? We never heard of that game before. And, uh,
7372600	7376280	so then the next week the correction came in like, Oh, it was time pilot.
7376280	7378160	But of course we get these notes from Japan.
7379040	7383040	The moment you said that I was like, time pilot guy,
7383080	7386280	you had a room full of gamers. All of us were like, time pirate. Oh,
7386320	7390880	that sounds cool. Yeah. But it's the same. Yeah. It's the same guy.
7390880	7392480	That's why as soon as you mentioned that I was like, Oh,
7392480	7395920	that totally reminds me of that story where we all were stupid for,
7396000	7398000	I always keep forgetting that it's the same,
7398040	7402200	the same person did the 1942 and Street Fighter. So, I mean,
7402200	7406280	that's sort of the big tie in, you know, as a whole series of, you know,
7406280	7407480	classic games right there.
7407960	7412600	I like finding the awesome people that installed so much of my childhood. Yeah.
7412600	7413440	That is pretty cool.
7414320	7419320	I spent a lot of time on a gyrus when I was much younger and not paying for
7419480	7424040	school. Paid with my sanity maybe.
7425600	7429840	All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Gyrus, uh,
7429840	7433640	don't go anywhere guys. We've got more of orange launch radio to come. Uh,
7433640	7435200	part B is going to be a little different this week.
7435200	7437400	We're going to do rapid fire news and then we're going to, uh,
7437440	7439680	not do any more news after that. We're going to do some discussions.
7439680	7442560	We're going to do top game of the week, disappointing game. I'm sorry.
7442600	7447040	Top game of the week. Top game of 2012, disappointing game of 2012.
7447080	7451040	Fugu question of the week, mailbag, lots of stuff coming up after the break and,
7451160	7454280	and no 3d cock. Well,
7454280	7457040	we don't want to traumatize any of the younger listeners even though this is not
7457040	7460160	a show for kids. Turn off the radio. If you're a five year old, you're listening.
7460240	7462400	Um, also tonight,
7462520	7467520	listless last listless of the year with our 2013 predictions in gaming.
7468960	7470000	Oh boy.
7470520	7474720	We'll be right back after this with more of orange lounge radio.
7480840	7485560	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live with our last show of the
7485560	7490560	year, episode 487 for this December the 30th of 2012 and we're going to get into
7492920	7496800	some of our favorite games of the year and things we weren't so thrilled with
7496800	7499880	this year as is customary to do on a year end special.
7499920	7504160	It's our totally cliche year end special coming up a little later,
7504160	7506800	but first we're going to travel around and get some rapid fire news.
7507120	7509840	The last news of the year that we're going to talk about. Loki.
7510440	7511080	All right,
7511080	7515840	so let's talk a little bit about tomb Raider and like any other game that's
7515840	7518960	coming out, they have to shoehorn multiplayer in there.
7518960	7520400	So that's what they did.
7520800	7524920	They confirm that it will have multiplayer and cool.
7526080	7527560	I'm trying to remain optimistic about it.
7527560	7529760	Multiplayer worked out very well for mass effect three.
7529760	7534520	I saw assassin creed threes multiplayer, uh, over the Christmas holiday. Um,
7534600	7537520	when we were watching somebody else play it, it looked interesting. I was like,
7537520	7541800	oh, that looks kind of fun to play. So multiplayer is not all bad. Yeah.
7542440	7547000	Um, of course there is the humble indie bundle seven that was out.
7547000	7549640	Now of course, like they do with most of the humble indie bundles,
7549840	7553000	they add stuff to it. So now if you pay over the average,
7553200	7557200	you get dungeon defenders, um, plus the DLC legends of grim rock,
7557360	7562080	the basement collection, offspring fling and cave story plus,
7562840	7566560	which is not bad. And yeah, I had to pick it up. Cave story is awesome. Yeah.
7566560	7569280	So yeah, but it was also in a prior humble bundle, but that's all right.
7569280	7572840	That's all right. It's this is a case. Oh yeah. I don't know.
7572880	7576920	Keeps her plus it was it. Yeah. Yes it was. Which one was it then?
7577040	7580840	They had that two years ago I think. Yes it was. It wasn't six.
7580840	7583800	It was four or five had it. Really? Yep. Really?
7584640	7586280	Cause I've bought all of them since like,
7587920	7589760	probably you better check your steam library again.
7589760	7592000	You probably have cave story you just forgot.
7593480	7597560	Problem of steam sales is I forgot I own this seriously.
7597600	7601800	I just bought another copy. No, I don't have it. So
7602920	7605840	I know that mine also gives me like a little indicator to say if I've already
7605840	7609040	bought a game. If I can get like a separate code, I'll just give you mine. Oh no.
7609040	7610520	You bought the humble bundle, right? Yeah.
7611800	7613760	Thankfully they're all separate so I can get rid of this.
7613760	7616640	Like there was one I bought. Oh I got yet another copy.
7616640	7619320	I swear to God I'm like handling the bundle for,
7619360	7623840	I'm swimming in copies of Metro 2033. It's like I have like four of them.
7623840	7627920	It's ridiculous. Um, but anyways, uh, so yeah,
7627960	7631640	humble bundle. It's awesome. She definitely pick it up and you know,
7631640	7633440	they've got the indie game, the movie in there,
7633440	7636960	shank and all that fun stuff and case or plus if you haven't played it,
7637000	7639200	like I haven't played it yet. Um,
7640800	7643320	there's going to be a lot of indie game playing in 2013.
7644320	7647320	That one also came with super me, boy, shank and bitcher runner.
7648160	7652840	Quiet, be quiet. Really? Cause I swear I got that one. Maybe I did.
7653320	7657360	Oh, I'll look it up while I'm doing so. Anyways, um, and the last but not least,
7657360	7660720	the first piece of DLC is going to be coming out to call of duty.
7660720	7664360	Black ops is came from a leaked sign from, I'm,
7664360	7667160	what can I assume probably like a game stop or something like that.
7667160	7669760	It's called call of duty black ops two revolution.
7669960	7674600	It's gonna include five maps, one of which is a zombie maps. They have hydro.
7675120	7679280	Um, looks like a dam downhill, which is a ski resort.
7681400	7684760	Uh, grind, which I can't really see in this picture at all.
7684840	7688080	They had a better, better picture when those on here. Um,
7689800	7693400	let's see. Oh, here we go. Okay. So, um,
7694720	7698040	grind, which appears to be like a, um,
7698760	7702400	a skate park or something, which is kind of cool. A mirage,
7702420	7705280	which looks like a maybe like an Asian environment.
7705280	7708640	They got a lot of pagodas in the background and die rise,
7708660	7710640	which is a zombie map on a high rise.
7710800	7714200	Plus they also give you this bonus peacekeeper, a sub machine gun,
7714400	7717800	apparently coming out on the 29th of January.
7718160	7722400	And it's supposed to be exclusive, I think for the Xbox three 60 for awhile,
7722440	7726000	which makes sense. They've been doing that in the last few call of duty games.
7727000	7728240	Um, I'm kind of excited about it.
7728240	7730280	I'm looking forward to some new maps cause we're kinda,
7731000	7732800	we played out the ones on a black ops.
7732840	7736120	Although I'm also looking forward to the rest of my coworkers fucking getting
7736140	7739400	that game so I can play with more than just one other person cause it's kind of
7739400	7743760	annoying. We're all in modern warfare three and yeah,
7743760	7748000	I had to kick their ass on Friday and so I won the year. Um,
7748080	7748920	so yeah, that's it.
7750080	7752520	All right, well I have a few news stories for you too.
7752520	7757040	And uh, one of them is another retro collection coming to iOS and uh, you know,
7757040	7760480	iPads and iPhones and all that good stuff. And uh, very interesting.
7760480	7764400	It's an info com collection. Uh, you may not remember that name,
7764400	7767960	but they did all the classic text adventure games back in the day.
7767960	7771240	Like Zork, Zork two, Zork three. Uh,
7771280	7774320	I believe hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy was one of their games too.
7774320	7777720	It's not in this, it's not in this bundle though. I thought it was on there.
7777880	7781000	Yeah. And Chanter's in there. Infidel. I remember that one. Uh,
7781080	7783320	planet fall witness. Yep. Wish bringer.
7783600	7788320	So anyhow we're spouting off all these names of games that are in the info com
7788360	7792640	bundle, uh, 27 classic adventure games, but it is $10.
7792960	7796200	Like a lot of these collections, you can get the core app for free.
7796200	7799440	The free one will come with Zork one. So you get that for free.
7799600	7802840	You can be eaten by a grew to your heart's content. Uh,
7802880	7806800	after that you can get five packs of games for three bucks a piece or you just
7806800	7809840	get everything for 10 bucks. You can also,
7809880	7812840	for I think a dollar by these things called Invisi clues.
7813040	7814720	They're the hint booklets for the games.
7814920	7816920	I have not checked out this collection myself,
7816920	7820120	but I'm told that they have like compasses and some additional features that you
7820120	7825120	didn't have back when it was just text on a Apple two E or a Commodore system,
7825120	7828400	you know, when they didn't have anything besides that. But you know,
7829120	7832600	it's fun for like five minutes and then you realize, boy, games got a lot,
7832640	7834480	you know, better. All right. Uh,
7835120	7836080	Nintendo powers.
7836080	7841080	Last issue ranked the top 285 Nintendo games of all time.
7841840	7844880	285 and you might ask why such a weird number? Well,
7844880	7848240	that's because there were 285 issues made of Nintendo power.
7848560	7853560	So that goes all the way from 285 superstar Wars on the super Nintendo.
7854280	7857760	Not a bad choice, although maybe should be a little higher all the way to number
7857760	7858880	one. What is,
7858880	7862600	what does Nintendo power believe was the best Nintendo game ever made?
7862720	7866840	Thoughts don't look regular Nintendo or super Nintendo, any Nintendo platform,
7866840	7868320	but it had to be on a Nintendo platform.
7868360	7872480	Best game ever made on a Nintendo platform. Super Mario Brothers. Uh,
7872600	7876480	that was number, the original Mario brothers was number 16.
7877200	7881640	Linked to the past. Linked to the past was number two. Super Mario world.
7882200	7884800	If that was number two, then I'm going to say Ocarina was number one.
7884800	7887960	Oh, Ocarina time was number one. The number one ever rated game.
7888960	7894040	Uh, the, if it's so funny, if you look at the top 10, okay.
7894040	7897200	Top 10, 10 resident evil four on the game cube,
7897880	7901600	nine Zelda Wind Waker, eight super Metroid.
7902000	7906480	It should have been one, seven Mario, three, six mega man,
7906480	7910520	two, five Mario world, four final fantasy,
7910520	7914240	three or six, three super Mario galaxy,
7914480	7918680	two Zelda linked to the past, one Zelda Ocarina of time,
7918720	7923120	Zelda Rina of time, Zelda Rina, where's Mario? Her name is Zelda Rina.
7923160	7927200	Eleven is skyward sword. 12 is the original legend of Zelda.
7927440	7930000	If you look at the top 16,
7930440	7934920	they are all Mario and Zelda games with the exception of eight super
7934920	7937960	Metroid, six mega man, two, four, five, Nancy three.
7937960	7942240	And get this at number 13, this surprised me. Elite beat agents.
7942840	7946360	Where's secret of mana? Secret of mana. Good question.
7949120	7952120	Secret of 88. Fuck them.
7954120	7955800	Yeah. I was going to say, what about earth? All right.
7955800	7958840	This is the last one I'm looking at. Oh, I didn't really V, V, V, V, V, V.
7958920	7962280	Was on the list at number 99. That's pretty good. Uh, all right.
7962560	7964600	I'm looking up earthbound. Uh, let's see.
7965600	7970120	Oh, earth, earthworm Jim at number 200.
7970120	7974080	Let's see earthbound one 56. Secret of mana. Beat it out.
7974120	7977160	Between maniac mansion and final fantasy five advance.
7977200	7979760	This I'll just games released in the U S right. Well, look,
7979800	7983160	let's just say there's a reason that they pulled the plug on that magazine and
7983160	7987960	that list will demonstrate it. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Kidding. God,
7988000	7992280	stop getting angry. All right. Cut a bitch. All right. Uh,
7992280	7996040	one other thing for you guys, did you know that not only is the Wii U region
7996040	7998760	locked, but the game pads are region locked as well.
7999960	8004120	Here's the thing. If you actually try to bring like a, uh,
8004240	8007880	another regions, we, you, uh, pad and hook it up or whatever,
8008080	8010600	when it tries to do the console updates,
8010720	8014880	it'll actually tell you the update cannot be completed with an overseas Wii U
8014880	8018280	game pad. I don't know why the fuck anyone would ever need this.
8018280	8021720	Like why would you be using some other regions game pad for when they
8021720	8024080	inevitably do fun colors in Japan that we don't have?
8024880	8028040	But then you'll have your own when you buy the unit, you'll have your own.
8028120	8032560	How many spice colored game cube pads do I have?
8032560	8034520	I think this is a little ridiculous to get angry over.
8034520	8037600	Let's get angry over the fact that the Wii U itself is not region locked.
8037600	8041000	That's where we should be focused on. It is region locked. I know. Right.
8041040	8044440	That's what we should be focused on. It is not. Huh? You said it's not bad.
8044440	8047960	It is regional. Well, let's be mad. Let's just be mad. Let's just be mad at Rob.
8048960	8053880	Anyhow. Uh, yeah. I mean, if, if whatever, okay.
8053960	8056480	And then the people are saying, well,
8056480	8060720	what if someday the games do support two game pads and you have a friend from
8060720	8061520	Europe over
8064040	8068200	fucking get over it. God, then you just fucking get over it. That's what you do.
8068400	8069800	You suck it up and you get over it.
8072040	8075360	Then you don't play that game. Yeah, exactly. You write an angry, you,
8075360	8078000	you know what? You write another angry article on the internet.
8078040	8081680	That's what you do. You go and post it to your three ones.
8084800	8089120	Dark Sakura. What do you have for us? Last stories of the year. Okay. Well,
8089160	8094160	Super Mario brothers three is going to be on the 3DS virtual console in Japan.
8095600	8098800	It's coming out in the new year and uh,
8098840	8101640	we don't really know when it's going to come out over here, but it's 500 yen.
8102320	8103960	Yay. What?
8105360	8109200	I heard an intake of breath as if you were going to add something to my comment
8109200	8111120	before I move on to the story about dirt bikes.
8111120	8115320	I just wanted to mention something to Rob and the reason why that, you know,
8115320	8117840	we should probably discount this list. The guardian legend is not on it.
8118040	8122280	What? This is why your magazine went bankrupt. I'm sorry.
8122680	8125800	Burn the infidels. Hashtag, hashtag. Sorry. Not sorry.
8125840	8128800	The guardian legends not on it. Neither is excite trucks. So you know what?
8128800	8131560	Fuck that. The best racing game and I think launch.
8132280	8136640	Two 86, two 87. Go, go figure. We sports resort.
8136840	8138160	Sharp stick eyeball.
8140920	8144520	So guess what's coming to battlefield three since I just mentioned a second ago,
8144920	8149880	dirt bikes, but no Camaro's. They are going to be adding offered dirt, uh,
8150320	8155320	dirt bikes, mechanized and mechanized horses to battlefield three for the fifth
8155920	8160920	mini expansion and game and new maps and capture the flag will be out.
8161600	8166520	Then there will be lightweight double a vehicles and new trooper drops that will
8166520	8170600	poop troops all over. And last but not least,
8171680	8176440	there's a trailer for a game that people are losing their shit about lightning
8176440	8177280	returns.
8179120	8182160	That's what Rob sounds like on the toilet when he loses his shit.
8183880	8187360	You're disgusting. You were the one who lost your shit.
8188360	8193040	So final fantasy 13, lightning returns. Um,
8193080	8197760	basically it looks kind of like assassin's creed kind of a style play with, um,
8198440	8201600	final fantasy people in it. Okay, I'm done.
8202880	8207480	All right. And that's what I said when I saw, you know, lightning returns.
8207480	8210680	I'm like, I don't even care. I'll buy it. I'm not even gonna try and lie.
8210680	8214880	Of course. Rob's our consumer horn. I have the other two. All right.
8215160	8217600	Uh, that's it for news. Uh,
8217640	8220240	but we do have some other things we want to talk about, uh,
8220280	8221960	before the show is over,
8221960	8226920	we want to get to 2012 in review and this is where I would use your usually play
8226920	8229440	like a bumper or something. I don't really have any bumper or music.
8229440	8232400	So actually when in doubt, just play dancer.
8234800	8237320	For some reason, you know, it was probably in my head. It would have been fun.
8238560	8241600	The level music from super Mario 64.
8242600	8246200	All right, whatever. Top game of 2012.
8246240	8249040	It's time to figure out what our top games of the year are. Now.
8249040	8249880	Here's the thing.
8250160	8255000	The question that we are really asking is what is your
8255000	8258760	top game of 2012? Because we don't want to get into that hole. You're wrong.
8258760	8260440	You pick the wrong game in it. Nope.
8260520	8265360	There's no right or wrong answer to what your or my top game of 2012
8265360	8270080	is. Can't be wrong. They're just stupid. Exactly. Exactly. Uh, so we'll, um,
8270560	8273320	uh, get to this in the frugal question of the week in a minute as well,
8273440	8277880	but we want to talk about what was your top game of 2012 and why
8278600	8280760	we're going to start with the person who, uh,
8280800	8282720	is going to be the most completely obvious with this.
8282720	8286360	Let's start with dark Sakura Mass Effect three. Duh. And why?
8287280	8288120	Garris.
8290360	8292280	Of course. And is there anything else you really, I mean,
8292280	8295920	you just started getting this year apart from that. Well,
8295960	8299120	I started playing Mass Effect three, what two months after it came out,
8299520	8302080	after I'd beaten the other two. Um, the,
8302280	8305360	there's a lot going on it that I like apart from just the stories and the
8305360	8309000	character development and the fact that you basically are building your head
8309000	8311480	cannon can be real in the game.
8311720	8315160	But the other thing that I like is modding the hell out of my shepherd and
8315160	8318440	tweaking the game and figuring out how I can push boundaries in it.
8318440	8322560	And I think I finally figured out how to get all the high res, um,
8322560	8324080	textures to work in Mass Effect three.
8324360	8328960	So that's going to be for my seventh playthrough. And it's, it's really like,
8328960	8331080	I made an albino shepherd. I made a blue shepherd.
8331880	8333760	It's the modding is so much fun for me.
8333960	8337920	I will spend three hours working on getting my character to look right before I
8337920	8342840	even do a mission. So it's, it's like having a girl,
8342840	8346800	shut up. It's like having the Sims and then actually having a good game.
8348240	8351920	So fair enough. And, and Garris,
8352600	8355080	Shakerion, Shakerion. It's Shakerion Sunday.
8356080	8360520	I posted a picture on mass effecting.tumblr.com.
8360560	8364680	When's, when's, when's, is Shenko Saturday or what's, I guess so.
8364920	8369600	Shenko's every other day. No. Um, but, but, but it said Shakerion,
8369640	8372240	deal with it. All right. Uh, let's,
8372240	8375600	let's do some of the ones that are going to be a little less obvious. Um,
8375640	8378480	let's go to our guest Flaco Jones and then we're going to do Alan as well.
8378480	8382720	Flaco Jones. Uh, for best game. Yeah. Your favorite. What's your,
8382800	8386520	your personal top game of 2012? I kinda, you know,
8386520	8389200	I had to make a decision cause I played two really great games this week,
8389200	8393280	but I'm going to stick with the walking dead just because I just love the story
8393280	8397960	and I love how everything you do in the game comes back and, and it made,
8398080	8401720	it all mattered. So it was a great game and it, you know,
8401720	8403480	not terribly long and a pretty good deal.
8403480	8405180	Like I know you guys are saying you got for 10 bucks.
8405180	8409280	I got it for 20 and I still feel like that was a great deal because it's about
8409840	8414160	two to three hours a chapter and you got five chapters. So that can 10,
8414160	8417960	15 hours for 20 bucks. I think it's pretty good. 10 bucks. Even better.
8418920	8423640	Fair enough. Uh, Alan is back with us in studio.
8424320	8428360	How are you doing? Good. So what would be your pick for game of the year? Well,
8428360	8432240	I almost had to recuse myself from this entire segment because I went through
8432240	8436480	the Wikipedia list of all the games that came out in 20. It came out in 2012.
8436680	8438880	I've played three of them all year.
8439800	8442820	So doesn't mean that Mass Effect was the only thing I played,
8442820	8447360	but all the games that I put hours on this year were from last year, 2010, 2009.
8447560	8451720	So I had three things to choose from. Black Mesa source.
8452680	8456400	It's my best because it came out finally after eight years.
8456400	8457880	So it proved all the haters wrong.
8458560	8463560	Half Life got some love and it's just a huge testament of what a fan communities
8463960	8467520	are capable of. It was flawlessly professionally done.
8467840	8471600	And when I say the mod community, I mean Skyrim, uh,
8471760	8474320	any community that has, uh,
8474360	8478000	or any game that has a community that people that will put out content like
8478000	8482080	this. Black Mesa is one of the pinnacle achievements of everything.
8482080	8486080	Minecraft, any game with a big enough fandom that lets you add stuff to it.
8486480	8488400	So, um, yeah, it plays awesome. Um,
8488400	8492920	Half Life hasn't had a game come out for it since oh,
8492920	8497920	seven with Half Life two episode two more time has passed between Half Life
8498480	8502280	two and now than the original Half Life one got at SQL Half Life two. So yeah,
8502320	8505240	it's my favorite franchise and they got some love. So that's my pick.
8506840	8509680	Good answer. That's um, not what I was expecting you to pick,
8509680	8511800	but now that you kind of said it, I'm like, oh yeah, that makes sense.
8512000	8512840	There's a lot of sense.
8513120	8515640	Three games to pick from and I had to do,
8515640	8517520	I have to do the worst of 2012 from that too.
8517800	8520840	All right, we can, we'll, we'll manage somehow. We'll manage. All right. Uh,
8520840	8523240	remember there's no right or wrong answer. All right. Um,
8523560	8527160	you've watched me play a ton of games and surely you can form an opinion out of
8527160	8528000	that.
8528680	8530200	Eh, it doesn't count if I don't play it.
8531080	8535560	Use your own criteria. The rest of the internet does. All right. Uh, Loki,
8535880	8538720	what is your top game of 2012?
8539280	8543000	Uh, cause also I didn't play that many games. Um,
8543960	8548640	during 2012 that came out in 2012, you know, it was like a handful of games.
8548960	8553160	I'd have to say probably Borderlands two and then just because it's, you know,
8553160	8557360	it's everything you liked from Borderlands one plus better writing, more guns.
8557440	8561200	And it's just, it's fun. It's like everything you loved before,
8561640	8566000	amped up to 11. It's, it's great. It was a great game. Great, you know,
8566040	8569680	shooting lots of, I love the writing in it. It's, I don't know,
8569720	8572720	I'm really enjoying him and enjoying the fact that I'm going back and playing it
8572720	8576520	some more because I kind of stopped playing it for a while. One, you know,
8576640	8578280	I got busy with Minecraft and everything.
8581080	8584160	Um, that leaves me, huh? Um,
8584200	8587280	I didn't really want to be predictable this year. Um,
8587320	8592320	but I reserved the right to change this because I still have a one or two games
8592360	8593680	I need to finish playing.
8593920	8596200	So I reserved the right to come back on a future episode and say,
8596200	8597200	I changed my mind,
8597440	8600480	but I think it's going to take a lot to sway me from choosing mass effect three
8600480	8601360	as my game of the year.
8601400	8605640	And a lot of that has to do with the fact that I got into the series this year.
8605640	8608760	So I kind of feel like I explored the whole trilogy this year.
8608760	8612760	So admittedly a little bit of that spilling over into mass effect three. Um,
8612800	8615600	but it's not really just what Jamie mentioned because what's funny about what
8615600	8620160	she's talking about is that's not what interests me at all in the game. Uh,
8620200	8622880	and I think that's a testament to the game itself.
8622920	8627080	I think the staying power of mass effect three is the multiplayer.
8627360	8630720	And I'm going to admit when I first reviewed the game here on OLR, I said,
8630720	8633600	I won't give it my game of the year because some of the things in multiplayer
8633600	8635000	tick me off. However,
8635480	8639080	I think they've come a long way in correcting some of that,
8639080	8643640	meaning that they have supported the multiplayer very well
8643640	8648400	since the day it came out and with many free maps and free
8648400	8650600	expansions and so forth, uh,
8650640	8654640	the expansions to the multiplayer have done a phenomenal job at keeping it
8654640	8655480	interesting.
8655520	8659920	And it's one of the few online communities where I actually really enjoy playing
8659920	8664320	the game online. It's an Xbox experience I've really enjoyed. Uh,
8664400	8667840	and you know, uh, had some great time playing with friends, the game as well.
8667840	8671240	There really isn't a game I've had a better value on this year with the
8671240	8673640	exception of maybe World of Warcraft,
8673640	8677840	Mr. Pandaria for the record. I really like multiplayer as well. And you know,
8677840	8681120	I thought I would hate it and I ended up really liking it.
8681520	8686200	I also like finding regular maps in the game that are actually the multiplayer
8686200	8690520	maps later on. So all that ending bullshit aside, it's,
8690640	8695480	it's not enough to really tarnish what I still feel was an amazing video game.
8695720	8700280	However, uh, there was a lot of great shit this year and you know,
8700360	8702040	journey really,
8702200	8705160	I was really almost wanting to name that just so that we could all have a
8705160	8708120	different one. But then I go back and I go, but I,
8708280	8711520	all the time I spent on Mass Effect three, I can't, I can't. Walking Dead,
8711520	8715120	however, I might take the crown.
8715160	8716680	If anything's going to snatch the crown,
8716720	8719400	wait till I finish Walking Dead episode five. Cause that might snatch it.
8719440	8724080	So we'll see. Cause you know, when, when the writing is good,
8724080	8725080	it's like really, really good.
8725080	8728320	And like Walking Dead has a lot of what I love about Mass Effect just in a
8728320	8729840	totally different type of universe.
8730000	8733840	But the whole like decision making that kind of comes back later on, it's just,
8734200	8737680	yeah, there's a lot of that there too. So I reserve the right to change my answer.
8738280	8741640	It's just the internet. It's not that serious.
8741960	8745240	Speaking of not that serious, let's go to the flip side.
8745600	8749200	What was your most disappointing game of 2012?
8749480	8752920	Maybe you could say the worst game, but I would say more like,
8752920	8756360	what was just such a huge disappointment that you're just really sad.
8756360	8760080	What was your most disappointing game of 2012? Um,
8760120	8762360	I guess we'll go in the same order. So Dark Soccer, I'll start with you again.
8762880	8765640	Um, Street Fighter X Tekken. Ooh.
8766120	8768280	It was piss in a bucket.
8769480	8774120	What about it? Just was it, it didn't play well, the whole Mega Man thing.
8774520	8778120	It just felt like a giant insult to the people who were fans of the series.
8778120	8780800	I can't help but think of the DLC being on disc.
8780840	8781960	That's what I'm always going to think of.
8782480	8787240	It's just a combination of a less than stellar
8787240	8790680	game combined with really poor business decision.
8790680	8795400	My, the fiscally responsible part of my brain just goes, no, can't do it.
8795400	8799960	And keep in mind, I didn't buy it. I borrowed it and I gave it back.
8800880	8805600	So it was pretty bad. Uh, who went next? I think Flaco.
8806080	8809280	What would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012? Well,
8809280	8812120	I didn't play it, so I guess that's why you can say it's not the worst game.
8812120	8815880	But I was very disappointed that I heard so many bad things about the Silent
8815880	8819920	Hill HD remake. That was pretty bad. Yeah. See,
8819920	8823720	I've never heard anything good about it. And it's just,
8823760	8826600	I was very disappointed cause I was very, I was very much looking forward to it.
8826600	8829240	I was going to buy it right away. But you know,
8829440	8831760	I guess luckily target didn't have it when it came out.
8831960	8833960	And then I heard more and more about it and I was like, you know what,
8834000	8836480	I'm not going to buy it. It sounds like it's a waste of money.
8836880	8840840	There's also that crap with them not doing the upgrade. The, yeah,
8841280	8844800	for the, that was for two right in the two and three collection. They didn't,
8844840	8847160	yeah, they didn't upgrade the graphics like we have,
8847440	8850680	or they didn't do the fog or something and wires are going off into the distance
8850680	8854280	and you can tell them having done a patch for other versions,
8854300	8857800	but not the Xbox one I think. Oh, I don't know about that. I just know,
8857840	8858640	see that's this thing.
8858640	8863080	There's so many bad so much bad news about that game and so many bugs and to
8863080	8867080	release a game with that many bugs, it's just like, it's just too much.
8867080	8871160	They needed their best tester back. That's the problem.
8871160	8874080	You laughed and everything went to hell. How did this get through?
8874080	8877720	I just feel like this guy back, I almost wonder if they took the viewpoint of,
8878000	8880800	you know, we already tested this game. It's fine.
8880800	8883720	We're just going to up residence to get out. It was a total disaster.
8883720	8888200	It sounded like, I don't know anybody who bought it and liked it. Um,
8888240	8890040	who'd be next? Oh, Alan. Alan's next. Alan,
8890040	8893000	what would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012?
8894440	8898160	Mass Effect Infiltrator for iOS and Android.
8898880	8899880	Yeah, that was kind of.
8900120	8905120	Cause I got my first smartphone ever finally in September and then I figured
8905140	8906160	out that the data pad,
8906160	8910240	which is like the sort of your characters in your party email you and it's
8910240	8913200	really neat. You can, um, you know, update your galactic readiness,
8913200	8915640	which is a mechanic and Mass Effect three through this app.
8915660	8916880	It's not available for the Android.
8917680	8922200	So only iPhone users get to do the little cute email character mini game.
8922480	8927440	So I was like, all right, I'll get the other Mass Effect, um, mobile game.
8927840	8931680	Infiltrator and you play a Cerberus dude and there's also ways that it ties into
8931680	8935560	the, your three main campaign. It's awful.
8935960	8940960	It's an amazing testament to how good graphics can be on smartphones nowadays,
8941200	8946200	but you play with your thumbs and it's really awful and it's not fun at all.
8947480	8950560	And it was like eight bucks that I wish I had back because I could buy lunch
8950560	8951400	with that.
8954120	8955840	It's not that good on iOS either.
8955880	8960760	Was it really eight bucks on, on sale for eight bucks?
8960760	8964600	I want to say it was 12 originally and I've heard it's no better on the iPad.
8964680	8966480	And I think, didn't you want to install it off your iPad?
8967040	8970720	Yeah, I did. It takes up a gig and it was just a wasted gig. No tan,
8970760	8973240	no tactile control or tangible controls makes it a bitch.
8973960	8977200	What's the IK though? I don't know. Cause I don't have one.
8977840	8980440	I thought that it worked with the IK, but I could be right. It might,
8980560	8983880	I don't know. Yeah, but that's all. Um,
8984080	8986840	I'm trying to remember what the other game was that came out this year that I
8986840	8991080	played Mass Effect Mass Effect three. Yeah. All right. Fair enough.
8991480	8993360	Uh, Loki, then I guess we go to you.
8993360	8996080	What was your most disappointing game that came out this year?
8996200	9001040	Lollipop chainsaw. Oh, it was terrible. Uh huh. It just,
9001120	9005720	it wasn't a fun game to play and it wasn't,
9005760	9008200	I mean it's just kind of like, Oh, it's Suda 51.
9008200	9010920	It's going to be so really crazy and edgy and stuff.
9010920	9014120	And they tried that with Shadows of the Damned and it was just not very good game.
9014440	9018360	Really? I liked Shadows of the Damned. Eh, it was all right,
9018360	9021320	but I liked what I saw of it. It's just, it wasn't,
9022000	9025560	it wasn't to the level of what I wanted. So I don't know.
9028040	9030320	Uh, I'll drop a whopper on this segment.
9030320	9033240	I'm going to say the most disappointing game of the year was Diablo three.
9034200	9035640	You know what? Yeah.
9036400	9039920	And I don't really know how to put it into words.
9039920	9043800	It's not that I necessarily like hate, I mean, here's the thing. It's,
9043840	9048080	this is very much not Diablo three was not the worst game of the year.
9048080	9050280	I would say the worst game of the year would be something like,
9050280	9052120	I was going to say Sonic four episode one,
9052120	9054360	but it only came out on the windows platform this year.
9054360	9056800	But that would still probably be the worst game of the year.
9056800	9059920	I would probably go with HD collection just based on what I've seen and so
9059920	9061600	forth. But I would say honestly,
9061600	9064160	Diablo three was the most disappointing game of the year.
9064160	9068360	Just some of the craptacular decisions Blizzard made towards with the whole
9068360	9070280	real money auction house was,
9070280	9075280	was just such a bad grab and the PVP getting removed out of it at the end.
9075480	9077600	It just, it just wasn't a lot of fun to play.
9077640	9082400	Like somehow the fun got sucked out over the 10 years between Diablo two and
9082400	9083080	Diablo three.
9083080	9086320	And I think a lot of that was Blizzard really not listening to their fan
9086320	9086800	community.
9086800	9089600	So I think they're really going to have to go back and answer to that a bit.
9090920	9092680	So when you got torchlight two,
9092680	9095880	didn't you think that the pickup and go within the first 20 minutes of torchlight
9095880	9097480	two was way more fun than Diablo three,
9097520	9099240	but Diablo three was how many years in the making?
9100080	9104520	I enjoyed torchlight two in the one hour I played it more than I did Diablo
9104520	9108160	three. And that says enough right there. I think you're absolutely right.
9108240	9111360	Torchlight two is a better game than Diablo three in my opinion.
9111760	9115400	So that's that. Uh,
9115480	9120200	looking at some of the comments in chat room at, uh, live.vognetwork.com.
9120200	9123760	Fantas says, no way. Diablo three should win game of the year. Sorry.
9123800	9124920	That's my personal answer.
9124920	9128360	I think it went poop of the year act. Acidic vampire says,
9128360	9132280	disappointing doesn't mean bad. I think that's a very important point. And yes,
9132280	9134960	I agree with you on that. Uh, tiger class says, Oh yeah,
9134960	9139400	Blizzard canceled the Diablo three PVP mode. Um, they, they didn't cancel.
9139440	9141640	Well, fifth dream fills it in there. They didn't cancel it.
9141640	9143560	They just postponed it there. They basically,
9144400	9146240	they realized it was, I mean,
9146320	9150480	that said to me that they weren't as far along with it as they let on.
9150680	9152960	And that now that they're actually building it, they're like, shit,
9152960	9154360	this doesn't really work out very well.
9154360	9157560	Or it's like it's throwing everything off balance. Like I, I,
9157720	9160120	I think they're pulling it out of their ass as they go.
9160280	9163280	And for a game that was 10 years in development, that's very alarming.
9163320	9165960	And at this point, is it going to come in an expansion? Probably.
9166760	9169800	That sounds ridiculous. I mean, they, they can't do that though.
9169800	9171520	They have to kind of patch it in because at this point,
9171520	9173320	wasn't that promised when they sold the game?
9174800	9175800	I didn't pay for it.
9177560	9181640	I never got my, I never got my dance studio, but I think there's a big,
9181760	9186360	there's a big difference between a Warcraft dance studio and PVP,
9186520	9190440	which has its very passionate fans, you know, even in, wow,
9190520	9193280	we don't talk a lot about PVP on a courthouse cause not a lot of it play it,
9193280	9196280	but there is definitely like, like one thing I learned this,
9196280	9198000	what we haven't talked about a lot about it during the show,
9198000	9199560	but we have been depth.
9199920	9203280	We've been dipping our big toe in the water when it comes to game streaming,
9203280	9205200	we're finally getting up with the current times.
9205400	9208680	We've kind of relaunched our Twitch TV channel and we did a couple of games
9208680	9213000	streams this week. We had mass effect three last week when there was no show. Uh,
9213000	9216040	we did some multiplayer to show that off and Shane and I were doing some
9216040	9219240	Warcraft this week while I was looking at some of the other Twitch channels and
9219240	9221520	kind of what people are streaming on their world of Warcraft.
9221640	9226520	Lots of PVPers lots of that is arena rated battlegrounds.
9226640	9229000	I mean, if you're wondering like who's doing rated battlegrounds,
9229000	9230200	just load up Twitch.
9230200	9233000	And I imagine any of the competing websites like you stream and so forth,
9233120	9235480	same story. There's a lot of that scene going on there.
9235480	9240080	So it definitely has their passionate fans. So, all right.
9240840	9244160	Uh, there we go. So let's get to the frugal question of the week.
9244240	9246360	Cause that was everybody, right? I didn't miss anybody. Just making sure.
9247400	9252000	We asked a very similar question in our frugal question of the week. Uh,
9252040	9255720	every week we ask our Facebook and our Google plus communities smash it
9255720	9260120	together. You get frugal a question and we asked them one of the same questions.
9260120	9264000	We just asked you guys. Holy fucking shit.
9264000	9268600	We got 25 responses on Facebook. Yep. I can't read all of these.
9268600	9271000	There were about eight after the first minute you posted it.
9271680	9274960	Yeah, I know. And I looked before the show, there was eight and I'm like, okay,
9274960	9278160	eight. I can manage that. Now there are 25. I,
9278640	9282000	I am overwhelmed by you guys being so awesome and replying,
9282000	9284200	but there's no way I can read all those answers. Oh my God.
9284240	9288280	There's five on Google plus two. There's five people on Google plus Rob.
9288280	9291880	If I have to read 10 emails, you have to read 48 little short responses.
9291880	9296120	All right. There's five Google employees that listen to the show. All right.
9296120	9299560	I'm going to, I'm going to really run through these. I apologize in advance.
9299760	9302840	I'm going to really trim your answers to get everybody's answers out there. Okay.
9303520	9304360	Um,
9305200	9308960	act depth says dust and Alicia and tail is the game of the year.
9309240	9310680	Dust combines RPG,
9310680	9314960	Metroidvania and beat them up style game play to make a real fun game to play.
9315200	9318680	And can you imagine this game was made by only one person?
9318880	9322640	That's quite the feat. I didn't know. I was not as huge into,
9322960	9325920	into dust and Alicia. No, nevermind.
9325960	9330600	I'm getting that game confused with from dust. Very different. Sorry. Sorry.
9331200	9335240	Yes. That is an awesome game that it was supposed to be an X-Box live indie.
9335280	9336480	I have not played that yet.
9336600	9339840	And it actually was so good that it became an X-Box live arcade game.
9340000	9344040	Okay. All right. So I will, I will make it a point to check that out later.
9344040	9345760	I thought when I first read it, I was like, Oh,
9345760	9348360	he's talking about that from dust game that I played once. And I was like, nah,
9348360	9350080	I'm not, I'm not into this. You know,
9350080	9351840	it's kind of trying to be populous or whatever.
9354880	9359720	Uh, Rob says my 2012 pick is the iPad version of pinball arcade.
9359720	9362480	It has the most tables and they're all from actual tables.
9362480	9366400	The iPad is the right size for the portrait orientation. Good, good,
9366480	9371320	very good pick. Uh, Nick M replied. He gave two answers,
9371320	9372160	big budget,
9372280	9377000	halo four citing three 43 is ability to pick up the franchise from bungee and
9377000	9378440	made the most polished halo today.
9378640	9382760	I got to say halo four was pretty rock fucking solid compared to some of the
9382760	9386600	previous halo efforts. I really agree with what Nick's saying there. Uh,
9386640	9390920	smaller studio walking dead, citing the emotional connection, uh,
9390960	9394200	red entertainment says three very good games. I've played this year,
9394200	9397400	mass effect three dragon age origins, assassin's creed three.
9397400	9400600	Remember it's this year. What, what you you've played. Uh,
9400600	9402680	when I think of a game that I've played throughout the year,
9402800	9406360	got a lot of enjoyment out of and shared with multiple people ticket to ride on
9406360	9410320	the iPad. You know the old, the board game, the trains. All right.
9411680	9415440	Uh, Justin M replied and said, dope upon kingdom for the wheat.
9415480	9416760	It was released a while ago,
9416760	9420640	but me and my partner started playing it obsessively this year. Uh, good,
9420680	9423880	not so clean because we make it dirty. Monopoly esque fun.
9424320	9428360	Now I'm kind of curious. What's a good, not so clean. Cause we make it dirty.
9428360	9432600	What's a like insensitive jokes or what's that all about there? All right.
9434400	9438200	Uh, let's see, let's get to some of the answers from Facebook. You ready?
9438200	9441440	Here we go. Degenerate Johnny. I'm positive.
9441440	9445200	I'm not alone when I say mass effect three. Why Garris?
9445920	9448680	Just that big curiosity. Are you degenerate Johnny? Like,
9451080	9454920	all right. Uh, DJ Rama S said, final fantasy theater rhythm.
9455040	9456720	It was a unique music rhythm game.
9457720	9460560	Rob himself said assassin's creed three.
9460800	9463760	They did a good job in reinventing a system that's not broken,
9463760	9466680	but feels fresh and new with the reasons you liked past games.
9466920	9469480	That's very interesting because a lot of people are giving assassin's creed
9469480	9473440	three shit. Um, I haven't played enough of it to say, see, see it either way.
9473440	9477120	But then again, Rob, here I am saying mass effect.
9477120	9480040	Three's my game of the year and there's a lot of people to give that series some
9480040	9484200	shit. So you know what? I am, I am sympathizing with you.
9485840	9490240	Uh, Eric S replied Tricoro. Do you guys even know what Tricoro is?
9490920	9494560	I've heard of it. Nope. I've heard of it. Do you know what it is?
9495000	9498960	No, it's 2DX BeatMania 2DX. I think number 20.
9500120	9503320	I just, that's why I knew what it was. Cause I was like,
9503560	9504680	it's one of the Bimani games.
9504880	9508160	Eric S says Tricoro because it's beat mania. Uh,
9508160	9512200	Cram said mass effect three. I think the flaws were exaggerated.
9512400	9514720	By the way, mass effect podcast.
9516760	9518920	Don't give me that look. We're working on it.
9520640	9525360	Look forward to more exciting things in 2013 from OLR studios. All right. Uh,
9525360	9528120	Haseo Sumuragawa says Borderlands 2.
9528280	9531120	Handsome Jack is the most lovable bad guy ever.
9531280	9534640	Can't help to giggle when his echoes pop up. That or Arkham city.
9534640	9535840	Cause Catwoman is a bad-ass.
9535880	9538640	Actually in the border, even though I didn't play Borderlands 2,
9538680	9543040	that would be Dan's game of the year to say, I have to say Mad Moxie's awesome.
9544520	9548600	Uh, Name and Lights says on console, Forza Horizon on PC,
9548600	9550760	Missipandaria. Uh,
9550760	9555720	Gamer Girl said a mud called Oasis taking it back to
9555720	9560280	the muds. That's awesome. You know what a mud is? Flocka, you got to confuse me.
9560520	9562920	It's you log into the terminal,
9562960	9565440	like speaking of text adventures like Zork and all that shit.
9566280	9569080	Imagine if you were playing a text adventure MMO.
9569840	9572120	That's kind of what a mud is. You go into like a terminal.
9572640	9573960	I don't think I've heard of that before. Yeah.
9573960	9576880	It's like they used to be much bigger like 10 years ago, but there's still,
9576880	9579600	there's still a scene for it. That's the ready player one.
9580200	9583720	Oh, okay. All right. Uh,
9583720	9586200	Gamer Girl says I love this game because my first time playing,
9586200	9588600	been playing since it came online a few days ago. Love it.
9589680	9594160	Dark Tetsuya says I'm going to change it up and say DDR2 for the Wii because of a
9594200	9598800	great song list. Flaming Toilet. God,
9598800	9603320	I love that username says Journey. Thanks to the communication limits,
9603320	9607480	there's finally a multiplayer game that doesn't make me hate people. True story.
9607480	9609600	I was talking to, um, if you listen to Horde House,
9609600	9611840	you've probably heard of Sunshine. He does,
9612120	9617120	he does the podcast with Spike Game Boy and he was talking to me,
9617440	9618680	he'll probably talk about this on his show.
9618880	9620520	He was talking about his play through on Journey.
9620520	9623600	He finally played it through the first time and he said he had a companion that
9623640	9626000	he had through most of the game too. And at the very end,
9626320	9629560	the companion drew a heart in the snow. Oh,
9630200	9633880	Oh, and it's like if you have all the fields at that same moment as well,
9633880	9635200	it's just like, I'm going to like,
9635200	9639720	that's like Les Mis level crying right there at the end. All right. Yeah.
9639720	9643480	I was always like really chatty in my thing. I would just be constantly like,
9643640	9645880	I would just be mashing and like, we got to go fast here.
9645880	9650280	So I'm just going to be like, follow me. I know where to go.
9650280	9652000	Watch out for the big stone dragon things.
9654600	9657640	Uh, dark Tetsuya in chat says, wait, OLR studios.
9657640	9659800	I thought you guys were a vog now. No, we are vog.
9659800	9664800	We're vog is the network that many of the OLR studios shows play on,
9665160	9666920	such as orange, Andreo and Horde house.
9666920	9669320	But if you look at the way movies are made,
9669440	9672240	sometimes the movie maker is not the same as the distributor.
9672760	9675480	Go research it on Wikipedia. All right. Meanwhile,
9675480	9680400	Veronica S replies and says Pokemon white version two because it's addictive.
9680840	9683160	Another Pokemon addict. That's all right though.
9683160	9686760	I know a lot of lot of pokey addicts. Ronnie B replied and said,
9686760	9691000	far cry three. It motivated me to enjoy gaming again.
9691000	9694000	That's a pretty big endorsement there. The environment is alive.
9694000	9698320	The AI acts responsibly, engaging and overall a great game.
9698680	9701160	It's on Steam sale right now. Uh,
9701160	9705200	Ferdinand F replied and said lone survivor. I haven't heard of that one,
9705200	9709600	but he says it scratched the silent Hill itch. I didn't realize I still had.
9710600	9714800	I will have to kind of earmark that we like survival horror. So, uh,
9714840	9718120	Burr replied and said, going by the number of hours poured into it.
9718120	9721920	Borderlands two, same great gameplay refined into perfection.
9721920	9724920	And some of the most memorable and funniest lines of the year, hands down,
9724960	9729040	honorable mention to assassins, Craig, assassins, Craig, Creed, not Craig,
9729280	9731800	assassins, Creed three, uh,
9731840	9735480	taking one of my favorite periods in history and adding new gameplay elements to
9735480	9737840	great effect. Osofer replied and said,
9737840	9741640	mass effect three keeps coming back long after it's been released only to play
9741640	9745840	through it again and explore new paths in the story or another ending to enjoy.
9746480	9750920	Uh, multiplayer endorsing that as well. Uh, more answers.
9751120	9755520	Raginator says Diablo two. I know it's a 12 year old title,
9755520	9756880	but he just got it this year.
9757160	9761680	Console wise is two way tie between magic 2013 and super stardust HD.
9761840	9763400	Those are two games on PlayStation three.
9763400	9768000	I love the most and put the most time into a acidic vampire said mass effect
9768000	9768400	three,
9768400	9771600	a fantastic finale to a trilogy with the best characters ever written for a
9771600	9774360	video game series. It's a pretty big endorsement. Uh,
9774400	9778360	Luliana says mass effect three. It's just that awesome.
9778640	9781480	Even if I'd played more while our hours spent, uh,
9781520	9784320	I really wish we got to do more with Rex, but still Emmy three,
9785160	9788400	Dave Falcon said it's Duke Nukem forever. What,
9789240	9790760	what are no wrong answer.
9790760	9795520	There's no wrong answer because I spent a good portion of 2012 playing it and
9795520	9800480	deus X human revolution because my fiance got me hooked on it. Oh, okay.
9801000	9805320	I see you played it cause the fiance, you had to for the fiance. That's all right.
9806160	9809040	P S happy new year. My gaming friends. Well, happy new year to you as well.
9810120	9812120	Gino L said the walking dead.
9812320	9816280	It handled some pretty taboo concepts gracefully and changed the way I think
9816280	9820040	about games. Change the way I think about games.
9820040	9825040	That's pretty heavy right there. That's now I'm like super interested.
9826080	9829600	Uh, Shane, uh, from hoard house replied and said mass effect three.
9829720	9831960	What a fucking shock. Hey,
9832320	9836640	most personally impactful game series I've ever played runners up persona for
9836640	9840760	golden and DJ max technica tune. Uh, SSJ 100. Matt said,
9840800	9844600	I'm going to say NHL 13 while this is no surprise for me,
9844600	9848720	given I buy NHL games every year without fail this year is special with the
9848720	9852960	current labor dispute and the possibility of there not being any hockey this
9852960	9856880	year. NHL hockey. I have to look elsewhere for my hockey fix. Well,
9856880	9859920	I do play and pick up hockey games in real life and go to minor league and
9859920	9862640	college hockey. NHL 13 is the only way,
9862880	9866280	only way to pay and watch my favorite players and teams play.
9866280	9870000	That's a depressing answer. It is sad that that's like the only way to get
9870000	9872760	hockey if you're in the NHL. Like I totally get it.
9872760	9875320	And like I think that's like an awesome answer in many ways,
9875320	9877000	especially if you're a hockey fan, but it's just like,
9877720	9880080	it really puts it into perspective. Like they, they,
9880160	9881840	they need to fucking figure it out.
9882120	9885160	We have gone over the fiscal cliff and hockey is what has happened here.
9885160	9887920	And this just happened like six years ago. They canceled their season. Yeah.
9887920	9890320	I think it was that long ago. Shame, shame baseball.
9890320	9893760	Never recovered from that shit. Well, I know they have now they have now,
9893760	9896960	but they took forever. But when the next bargaining agreement came by,
9897000	9900280	they signed it and they got it done right away. They didn't drag this out.
9900280	9903000	And the hockey is doing this now for the second time in less than 10 years.
9903040	9906800	Wow. A code man replied and said the walking dead.
9907080	9910360	I've never felt so emotionally attached to a game in a long while.
9910360	9914840	And this one definitely hooks you last but not least. Alpha Kananagram,
9916120	9921120	Hatsune Miku project diva F even though the scratch feature is meh.
9922000	9926520	Good. No wrong answers. I know, but I'm as in, I'm not surprised. Oh, okay.
9926720	9930280	Good music rhythm game with neat bonuses. There you go.
9930320	9935120	I liked the variety of answers there. That was great. Um, it wasn't all,
9935120	9937920	I mean, of course there was some mass effects, walking dead journeys,
9938120	9939280	the things you're going to expect to see.
9939280	9942760	But I really liked hearing about some of those other ones too. Uh, really,
9942880	9944520	really neat. So thank you guys for answering.
9944520	9947360	And I went ahead and read just about every year,
9947360	9950000	every answer that actually had a game in it. I read those answers.
9950320	9953520	So there you go. Thank you, Facebook. Thank you, Google.
9953520	9955720	Thank you to everybody who's participated. Uh,
9955800	9959840	was that a new segment for this year or did we debut that last year this year?
9960160	9963920	So thank you for, um, catching onto our new segment this year. We appreciate it.
9964920	9969600	All right. Uh, that means it's time to go to the mail bag. Oh yes.
9969600	9973120	Revenge will be mine. Here we go to the mail bag mail bag at orange
9973120	9978480	lounge, radio.com. You guys sent a lot of fucking email this week.
9978520	9980480	Yeah, but some of them aren't very big. Okay.
9980480	9984080	So dark soccer is going to read your emails. Uh, but if she skipped some,
9984120	9985400	don't be hurt because seriously,
9985400	9987880	there were like 10 emails in there where I look, don't be butthurt.
9987880	9991320	All it does is make you stink. All right. Dark soccer. Read some emails.
9992040	9996160	This comes from Grimsley because it's a person I haven't seen before.
9996160	9999400	I'm reading it because I'm nice. Hey guys, love the show.
9999400	10001920	I was wondering what the name of the background song used in one of your
10001920	10005520	segments. It starts out like Bela Lugosi's dead. If that helps.
10006000	10009680	Hope to hear from you soon. Happy holidays. What do we have?
10009680	10011160	That sounds like Bela Lugosi's dead.
10011160	10016000	Honestly, cause I could only think of the chorus of
10016000	10016840	Bela Lugosi's dead.
10017240	10021920	So I went and YouTubed it and the beginning sounds an awful lot like this.
10023560	10024600	Oh yeah, that's true.
10025720	10030240	It's the boogal song. La Bossa Nova de Fabienne from Beatmania.
10031360	10034440	It was in the hip hop mix in the U S I think it's from, um,
10035240	10038040	some of the Japanese mixes too. Anyway,
10038040	10041760	what I did for this listener and for anybody who's asking questions like what
10041760	10043920	song are you using on orange lounge radio?
10044160	10048080	I made a post in the vog network forums at vognetwork.com.
10048120	10052040	Click on forums, click on orange lounge radio and there's a topic. Yeah. Well,
10052080	10054040	you know, we get more people over there. There's a topic.
10054040	10055600	What music do you use on orange lounge radio?
10055600	10059440	And I gave you all the songs and links to the YouTubes so you can, you know,
10059480	10060000	do it.
10060000	10062480	How about for our listeners who, uh,
10063960	10068280	aren't as in tune with the goth music scene, play a little Bela Lugosi's dead.
10068280	10071400	I was just about to do that except you were like two steps ahead of me.
10071440	10074120	Was that the entire email? Yeah, pretty much.
10074760	10078120	I wouldn't mind reading the rest of the emails to Bela Lugosi's dead. Hey,
10078120	10083240	and if anyone ever watched, um, you know, early two thousands SNL goth talk.
10085240	10090240	Hi Asriel, the prince of dark and sorrow and he works with me at the sit up.
10092480	10096160	All right, here's, here's the nine minute mix of Bauhaus,
10096160	10100840	Bela Lugosi's dead. See that.
10101000	10103880	So I thought it has to be the fugal song.
10106080	10111040	Uh, Bauhaus named after my favorite art school that got shut down by the Nazis
10112040	10112880	but reopened.
10113400	10115640	But then like all the way towards the end of the song is when it gets into the
10115640	10116480	more familiar part.
10119280	10120120	But honestly,
10120200	10123480	we would not have certain styles of furniture today if not for the Bauhaus
10123480	10124320	movement. Just saying,
10125800	10130560	don't ever ask an art student to go off on stuff like that. Anyway, um,
10130600	10133960	this one comes from spazzinator. Hi gang.
10133960	10136120	It's your raging neighborhood spazzinator.
10136800	10140400	The strange thing happened that interrupted my plans to get a cat this weekend
10140400	10142040	and let's take a minute. Just sit right there.
10142480	10146560	I'll tell you how I became the catless raginator in Buffalo. Oh,
10146560	10149040	he's doing it as a, as a
10150800	10153680	fresh prince. Yeah, but I'm not going to wrap it.
10157360	10160240	You're moving with your auntie and uncle Garris on the Normandy.
10161160	10164760	It's a parody. I get it. Yeah. I'm not reading it. Sorry. Can I wrap it?
10165040	10165880	I just closed it.
10168960	10172360	All right. I rage nator, I will do your email justice.
10172360	10175640	Give me a moment to set it up. Okay. I'm going to go ahead to the next one.
10175960	10180240	This is from nasty canasta and I'm sorry I don't speak any Spanish other than
10180240	10184120	Fuego. Um, so I'm going to try to pronounce this right.
10184120	10186800	Is Ola y buenos burritos.
10187800	10189920	Ola y buenos burritos.
10190560	10192920	I would like to bring your attention to your attention.
10192920	10195920	A game announcement that flew under the radar, the binding of Isaac remake.
10196240	10201040	Only touch on major points announced so far produced and developed by Nicholas
10201400	10205320	releasing at the end of 2013. Currently confirmed for PC, PS3 and Vita.
10205320	10209160	Nicholas is in talks with Nintendo and Microsoft have come and to have the game
10209160	10210640	on Wii U, 3DS and 360.
10210640	10213120	The remake will support a new pixelated look similar to that of the GBA.
10214120	10217800	All content will from the base Isaac game and the wrath of the lamb expansion
10217800	10221400	will be included plus another batch of new content about as big as wrath of the
10221400	10225760	lamb is in the remake. Local co-op confirmed no online co-op is that would
10225760	10226760	extend development time.
10227080	10230160	Danny Baranowski returns to compose new and remixed tracks, new player,
10230760	10231840	playable character, new ending,
10231840	10235680	and new final level that seems likely to appear after the game's shale level.
10236040	10239280	Anyone interested in finding out more in depth remake details can go to Edward
10239320	10244320	McMillan's Tumblr at EDMUNDM.com and the binding of Isaac's subreddit on Reddit.
10246240	10249040	I have also attached a mock up screenshots made by Edmund himself.
10249040	10252160	Happy burritos nasty canasta. And um, yeah,
10252160	10255080	I can't really link these to everybody, but thank you for the reminder though.
10255080	10258480	Because I remember reporting on this before cause we were kind of joking like
10258480	10261960	LOL remake of a game that's not that old, but uh, yeah, I was interested in it.
10261960	10265200	So by the way, uh, Ragenator's email,
10265600	10267120	the problem is at the end of it,
10267120	10269680	he turns it into a Rick roll thing and uh,
10269720	10272160	I'm still a little upset about the time he tried to Rick roll the show.
10272160	10273600	So we are sending rage.
10273640	10276880	I will not be doing that email justice and we will be sending that email to the
10276880	10279600	round files. So here you go, Ragenator. Here goes your email.
10284880	10286720	The vog network.com.
10287680	10291040	Okay. This is from raw steel UT. Hey guys,
10291120	10294040	now that we're all done with Christmas and getting our new year's resolutions
10294040	10294880	ready and shit,
10295120	10298360	what are you guys looking forward to in the next year in gaming?
10298720	10302200	Any cool games? Maybe some cool, but ultimately useless gimmick thoughts. Ahoy.
10302800	10304200	Um, I'm playing more mass effect.
10304640	10308840	Hold that thought because we have a list list coming up that is tackling this
10308840	10311120	exact topic. You read our minds.
10313080	10314880	Holy shit. Off topic.
10314920	10317480	One of my friends has a copy of the live action Rurouni Kenshin movie.
10317880	10322480	Gonna watch it. Okay. Next up. I told you I was reading them all.
10323480	10325640	Do your orange Jones radio. First off,
10325640	10329800	I would like to apologize for any grammar mistakes I may make as I have been
10329800	10332960	very tired. I love the whole covering my ass in the beginning thing.
10333480	10336200	If you cover your ass in the beginning, that's fine. All right.
10336400	10339680	I wanted to send a personal thank you to all of you for helping me with an issue
10339680	10344000	I've had problems with dealing with for a long time now. A while back I asked,
10344040	10347160	what was the best way to come out to friends and family regarding sexual
10347160	10349920	orientation? You all gave me great help with it.
10349960	10353080	The one thing I learned from OLR is to be yourself. Tonight.
10353080	10356440	I finally told my youngest sister that I have been bisexual for a good while.
10356440	10357240	Now, 10 years,
10357800	10361040	she asked if I had a girlfriend and I said that I had,
10361080	10363280	but things didn't go well. She said, well, you know,
10363280	10367280	you could have told me and I wouldn't have cared one way or another because
10367280	10368800	you're my sister. I said, well,
10368800	10372760	I was afraid because of our beliefs about quote that sort of thing. She's,
10373640	10376640	she said, are you crazy? You're my sister and I care about you and love you.
10376920	10379200	So I just wanted to let you guys know that thanks to you all,
10379200	10382720	I finally got the courage to come out because of you all just to tell my sister
10382720	10385040	how I felt. Thanks again. Sincerely, gamer girl.
10388160	10391920	I think in many ways like, and I think we get asked this question a lot,
10391920	10396400	like you've been doing this show for how long you've been doing this show for 10
10396400	10397360	and a half years.
10397680	10401640	What motivates you to spend every Sunday to give up your entire Sunday night and
10401640	10404680	you don't go out to the clubs anymore and you go stay inside and you do this
10404680	10407280	internet radio show, like what do you get from that? Why do you do that?
10407920	10409560	And like in many ways,
10409560	10413360	that email that she just read like just justifies everything. Yeah.
10413880	10415360	So thank you.
10416600	10420960	Totally. And major congrats to you too.
10421040	10424240	And absolutely. I'm making it about us,
10424280	10428400	but congratulations to you and I know that you and I have talked about other
10428400	10433000	things too, so just keep your chin up. Not you and me, Rob,
10433000	10435400	but me and her. I got it. Hey guys,
10435440	10437360	Sterling here. A couple of weeks ago,
10437360	10441480	you guys were talking about Konami's VRC6 sound chip for the Famicom,
10442000	10444040	but did you know there was a step above that?
10444040	10448880	The VRC7 to the NES sound capability to a whole new level placing literally
10448880	10451640	on par with the Genesis slash mega drive. However,
10451640	10456400	only one game uses amazing chip being the Japanese exclusive RPG, uh,
10456440	10460440	LaGrange point. There's okay. He linked to YouTube on it for how it sounds.
10460960	10463880	Rob, if you would actually pull that up for me, I would greatly appreciate it.
10464120	10466200	I will. Sorry. I was yelling at Ramen check as Ramen said,
10466200	10468840	who the fuck goes clubbing on Sunday nights? We used to go,
10468840	10471480	it's not around anymore, so we wouldn't, but the, the, the,
10471680	10475400	and don't make fun of us, but we had the goth club, the rage, the,
10475480	10478760	it was the rage and they changed their name. What was it called? Asylum. No,
10478800	10482320	remember we went to the rage for my bachelorette party. Yeah, I know.
10482760	10485920	But that was like, and after all the vodka shots,
10486040	10489040	the jello shots and watching Barbarella. I've been asked,
10489040	10491240	when was the last time you went to asylum? And I'm like, I don't know.
10491240	10495640	When did I start OLR? So anyway, I'm sorry.
10496160	10500000	Uh, which one am I pulling up? Oh, this one. Yeah. From, um, Sherlock. Okay.
10500040	10504040	Got it. Okay. Yes. I want to do a play this. Okay.
10504040	10506520	So let's listen to a little bit of it. I'm going to fast forward a little bit
10506520	10511520	here. That's a Nintendo game.
10512360	10516520	That sounds very unlike most Nintendo games you're used to hearing.
10517880	10519920	I probably picked like a really boring part, but
10521880	10523760	it looks like fantasy star. Sounds pretty.
10530240	10533160	I also wanted to tell you about a mainstream game I've been playing from a
10533160	10536320	series, which I never thought would be playable for blind people.
10536600	10538240	That being resident evil six.
10538480	10541120	This game is what I like to call accidentally accessible,
10541120	10544760	meaning that some of its features tend to help blind people without meaning to
10544960	10547320	chief among these is the PDA system,
10547520	10548840	which points you in the right direction.
10548840	10552280	You need to go as long as you have the button for it held down while you walk.
10553120	10557200	I'm already most of the way through chapter two of Leon's campaign and I'm
10557200	10559640	through the trickiest section as far as accessibility goes.
10559880	10563000	That being the bell puzzle. Anyway, enough of my rambling.
10563040	10566560	I hope you guys are having an awesome holiday season and keep up the awesome
10566560	10568440	job as always. RIP Shermy,
10568600	10571880	Sherlock, my baby.
10573800	10576080	Yes. That has been the sad part of my year.
10576560	10579000	You guys have made the holidays even more awesome.
10583600	10586640	Sorry. I was thinking about my kitty. Looking forward, not back.
10587120	10591720	I know it's tough. Um, this comes from, um, Robert M.
10592040	10597040	First here's hoping, uh, is that a Chiron beta cheer on beta prime was on your
10597600	10599880	holiday rotation. Secondly,
10599880	10602280	if any of you have any experience with doing this,
10602440	10606600	does anyone there or in chat know how well an Xbox 360 controller works on Mac
10606640	10610720	OS still a leopard or later? Finally, does Minecraft support said controller?
10611360	10613480	I wouldn't know about the Mac side of it,
10613480	10617320	but I can use the controller in Minecraft at all in Minecraft.
10617360	10619280	I use the controller all the time in Minecraft. Oh yeah.
10619320	10623680	I use keyboard when I play. Yeah, I believe that. I, in fact,
10623680	10626080	if you play on our server, uh,
10626120	10629400	or you just have access to the VOG network forums, uh, for PC,
10629400	10633560	at least I have an expatter profile that you can use for the Xbox 360 controller
10633560	10638160	that works perfectly and it works almost almost identical as the 360 version,
10638160	10642120	but not quite. I'm fairly certain there are drivers available for Mac OS.
10643080	10645920	And I know, uh, probably doesn't help this email or,
10645920	10649400	but the PlayStation three controller actually works with Mac OS.
10650120	10653560	Okay. And now I was told to stop reading this on the air immediately.
10653560	10656120	This part of the email, no, I'm not going to go any further. Um,
10656160	10658440	it actually is for me and I'm forwarding it to my personal email.
10658680	10662120	So you'll hear from me there. Sounds kinky.
10664760	10668160	Shut up, Rob. It was actually really nice. All right.
10669200	10672440	I was just sort of trying. How does he know what you're wearing today? I'm just,
10672440	10673480	I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right.
10673800	10675800	When do I ever wear something that isn't black?
10677560	10679200	So you're saying they're black.
10681200	10682040	Yes.
10684800	10686080	Next email.
10689040	10693120	I love tooling you guys. Seriously. All right. Two emails left.
10693520	10695720	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
10695920	10699480	Now that it's cold on the East coast, I need another form of exercise. Well,
10699520	10703600	I, we can't help you with that. Um, so I set up TDR in my unheated workshop.
10704040	10707200	I was totally getting back into it and I noticed that my score sucked.
10707960	10711240	I've played a few times since then and the left arrow works about 25% of the
10711240	10716280	time. So Loki, do I buy, build or hang myself from frustration.
10716640	10720760	I've researched a lot online and it's hard to find a good pad since they're not
10720760	10721600	made anymore.
10721760	10726280	Even the metal pads you can find on eBay and Amazon get so-so reviews and should
10726280	10730120	I stockpile new pads since dance games are dead? What would you recommend?
10730120	10732160	Keep in mind that I'm budget conscious.
10732400	10735320	Good day citizens from your loyal turtle in Philly. Serious turtle.
10735720	10738480	Well, depends on how much you're going to actually play. Cause um, you know,
10738480	10743440	I remember I've looked into great detail for as pads go,
10743480	10745400	but um, yeah, you're right. A lot of them,
10746160	10747240	they're pretty terrible,
10747280	10750880	but there are mods you can do on some of them to make them not so bad.
10750880	10754760	Like some of the, uh, I'm trying to think what, what pads there,
10755040	10759560	but most of them even on the eBay and stuff are really overpriced for what they
10759560	10763400	are. So, um, your best bet is just, uh,
10764160	10767520	I mean you can make something. I've made a few different types of pads.
10767520	10768680	The last one I did was the
10768680	10769520	um,
10770600	10774680	Riptide pad I think. And that one cost me,
10774680	10777480	I think $300 for two.
10777880	10782840	So that's not too bad. And um, if you only need one, it's even cheaper.
10784120	10786640	Um, and it wasn't too bad. It just, it didn't ground it right.
10786660	10789040	But now we're just going to remake the whole thing anyways. Cause I have,
10789280	10793080	you know, some sheet metal sitting in my garage will shed. Um,
10794520	10797760	I don't know. I, I'd go with the home built pad if you, if you can do that.
10797800	10801080	Otherwise, um, you know, the metal pads are all right,
10801080	10802920	but just make sure if you do get one, make,
10803040	10808040	it's like a really thick pad cause I bought some metal pads are about an inch
10808720	10813720	thick and they bent like it was really bad.
10814000	10817440	So just read reviews and you know,
10817440	10820040	ask on like some of the music game form,
10820040	10824560	especially people are using pads a lot. And I'd say as far as being, um, you know,
10825560	10829280	music games aren't done. I mean, music console games are kind of dying,
10829280	10832240	but if you want, you know, to do the PC, you know,
10832920	10834520	simulator scene and that kind of stuff,
10834880	10838280	you're going to have a lot more options available to you and that's probably not
10838280	10840680	going to go away anytime soon. So that'd be the way to go.
10842800	10843640	Alrighty.
10843840	10848560	All right. And the last email then if we're ready. Hey, OLR crew,
10848560	10853200	AZHP here with an option or two on the news stories last week about online
10853240	10856280	services for games like Neverwinter Nights being shut down.
10856280	10858640	Whereas Star Wars Battlefront for PS2 is still running.
10858960	10862560	My quote friend who worked at GameSpy told me that when developers stopped
10862560	10864680	paying their fees for their services to stay up,
10865000	10869200	GameSpy would just not shut them down. Um,
10869240	10871920	because getting a massive uprising of players getting butthurt that their
10871920	10875080	online games were getting shut down was more trouble to deal with than just
10875080	10878560	leaving the service up. My guess is that Gloo Mobile,
10878600	10882160	the company that bought GameSpy from IGN is realizing they've made a poor
10882160	10883240	investment on GameSpy.
10883240	10887560	They paid about 45 million in stock for GameSpy and the employees are jumping
10887560	10889920	ship because they don't like the new direction Gloo is taking them,
10890240	10893980	found out about this practice and is trying to write some developers out for
10893980	10897560	games they've stopped paying for. And those developers are, surprise,
10897760	10901200	not willing to pay for 10 year old games and are just letting them get shut
10901200	10905240	down. Just my little insight into the world of video game business,
10905280	10906800	you're truly AZHP.
10907600	10909160	I don't think it was that they were giving up on them.
10909160	10912400	It's just that they're raising the rates so much that it's just not cost,
10912520	10913880	you know, effective for them. I mean,
10915080	10916560	I think that's really what it comes down to.
10916920	10920920	I found that part fascinating that they'd rather keep them running than have to
10920920	10924400	deal with the internet rage. That says a lot right there.
10926800	10927640	That was it.
10929240	10930080	I'm eating.
10933520	10934760	No help. We have dead air.
10935440	10936160	Okay, Rob,
10936160	10940360	jeez, you have to shove your face with stuff and have me fill in the time.
10940600	10943920	Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris.
10944240	10946640	I will keep saying Garris until Rob finishes chewing.
10948440	10950800	How about FUs? Okay.
10961400	10962960	My FU goes to AAA
10963960	10967960	um, because of, um, claim issues from my car accident.
10968480	10970360	I may not be in a bad spot,
10970400	10974160	but somebody else who was involved in the accident, um, was
10976600	10980400	for things that were proven on record to have been caused by the accident.
10980400	10983920	So I'm going to take it up with them and they may be losing a customer.
10986080	10986920	Loki.
10987160	10988000	Um,
10988000	10992640	I guess FU to the fact that there's no one on Final Fantasy 11.
10993120	10994160	It's kind of lonely. I mean,
10994160	10998240	I like the fact that now I can actually camp the notorious monsters if I want to
10998240	11000280	and be able to attack them.
11000440	11001760	Leaping Lizzie's all yours.
11001800	11004160	No, seriously. Like I ran across them away.
11004200	11007320	Here's a notorious monster and we'll fight it. And I did and I killed it.
11007320	11010600	And I didn't actually get the drop, but, um, I was like, yeah,
11010600	11011440	that's kind of cool.
11012360	11016480	Yeah, I noticed quite a few. Um, so it's neat. Um,
11016880	11018800	and then of course, you know, uh, FU,
11018800	11022320	the fact that I've got some big projects I want to work on and
11022880	11027200	I've been just like brain fried lately and I just haven't been able to
11027200	11030040	concentrate on them. But some major stuff hopefully,
11030560	11033440	hopefully I'll actually work on this year. I really need to focus on it.
11036000	11036440	All right.
11036440	11036680	Uh,
11036680	11039680	my FU of the week goes to my cohost for not knowing how to fill dead air when
11039680	11040800	I'm eating. Uh,
11040800	11044560	We didn't know you were getting food. Jeez, Rob. This is Rob.
11048160	11051680	And FU to Dark Sakura for furthering berating me during my FU segment.
11052480	11055960	Uh, and just FU to the fact that vacation is blown by.
11055960	11060960	I have to go back to work on Wednesday. I know I have to go to work tomorrow.
11061400	11065600	No, it sucks to be here. Why if I have a whole week off? Oh my gosh. But you know,
11065600	11069720	no, in all seriousness, it's been a great mental break. So I'm like, I'm,
11070000	11072280	I'm actually at this point where I'm like, I'm re I'm,
11072560	11075640	I'm looking forward to going back to work and taking care of all these projects
11075640	11080000	I've got going on. That'll change a day later. FU to myself for me. No,
11080000	11082280	I do like my job though. I feel it's, you know,
11082600	11084720	who doesn't like a break from their day job though,
11084720	11087520	to go do whatever they want for a while. It's, it's a good mental rest,
11087520	11090960	but I'm ready for 2013 to be a kick ass year.
11091520	11095040	By the way, can I throw in a happy birthday to a celebrity? No. Yes.
11095840	11100600	Michelle Nichols turned 80 today. She is a flawless goddess. She, she is,
11100680	11103920	she is pretty damn flawless. I have to, she's one of,
11103920	11105200	she's actually one of my,
11105480	11109040	I would say the only flaw I could think of possibly for her was that she
11109040	11111840	participated in season two of euros, but otherwise,
11113040	11116240	otherwise she did a fan dance at 50.
11117400	11120880	Yeah. All right. Uh, yeah.
11120880	11124600	If you go vitamin water for making me pee like three times in two hours,
11124600	11125960	I'm not a pregnant woman. I swear
11128920	11133120	you're just getting old like the rest of us. It's vitamin water's fault about me.
11133120	11136640	Your half birthday just recently passed too. Cause mine day I'm like, Oh,
11136680	11141600	I'm almost 35. Yay. All right. Fun to be old. Yeah. All right.
11142960	11147760	Let us get to one more segment before we get
11147760	11150520	to the other classic game of the week.
11150520	11152880	I'll explain in a minute and our Twitter topics and so forth.
11153120	11156480	It is a segment we like to call listless.
11156480	11157320	Okay.
11164840	11167160	All right. The way listless works,
11167160	11169400	we are going to put together the ultimate list.
11169400	11173160	This is a very scientific process. Y'all the ultimate list.
11173560	11175080	We're not going to have the theme music all night tonight.
11175200	11180200	The ultimate list to discuss the top three of a topic and that topic tonight is
11181880	11185840	your 2013 predictions. Ooh. Okay.
11186160	11188040	So here's the way listless works.
11188040	11190640	We're going to go around the room and the folks participating tonight are myself,
11190640	11194560	Dark Sakura, Loki, Flacco, and Allen. We have a five man listless tonight.
11195560	11198400	You have a four man and one woman listless.
11198400	11203240	We have a five person. There's a woman man. So there you go.
11203480	11207760	You know what? My man, my boobs dominate. All right, fine, fine.
11209640	11213720	We have four men in a nag. Bitch, please. I will cut you.
11214720	11217640	All right. Doing tonight's listless. Ah, you know, I love you. All right.
11217640	11218520	We're doing tonight's listless.
11218520	11220680	We're each going to go around and put three items on the list.
11220680	11222440	Then we will go around and it's a really tough thing.
11222440	11224360	We're going to take one answer off the list,
11224360	11228040	but there's a twist in tonight's listless. This is,
11228120	11232280	this is a listless twist for 2013. So.
11232280	11233160	Twistless?
11233160	11237480	It's twistless. Here's the deal, because there's so many people tonight.
11238360	11242520	If somebody gets two of their answers taken from the list,
11242600	11247080	their third answer automatically becomes immune and cannot be taken from the
11247080	11250880	list. That's the twist. Immunity idol for an answer.
11250880	11253000	So if you get two of your answers taken off the list,
11253200	11255080	your other one cannot be eliminated.
11255080	11260040	May I suggest that we play the, uh, the whole tribunal song,
11260040	11262760	you know, while we're doing the eliminations,
11262760	11264480	that might be kind of funny there.
11266360	11271320	I'll see what we can do. All right. Um, so, uh, all right.
11271400	11276080	So that's the twist this, this, uh, this year with listless 2.0. So anyway, uh,
11276120	11278600	in all seriousness, let's go around and start forming the list.
11278600	11282560	The chatters will then vote and they will get to put together the ultimate list
11282560	11285200	by the way, and I will throw this out there.
11285440	11289720	There actually is another upgrade coming to listless in 2013. Uh,
11289740	11291520	not just the upgrade I previously mentioned,
11291520	11294640	but we are going to have a way that podcast listeners can participate in this
11294640	11297320	segment next year. So stay tuned.
11297320	11300920	We are going to do one segment where the podcasters get to participate as well.
11301320	11305320	Uh, in 2013. So expect this segment to come back. All right. Anyhow,
11305480	11308800	it is your predictions in gaming for 2013.
11308800	11312240	This can be as serious or as silly as you want. Chatters,
11312360	11315440	we may look to you for some answers as some good ones get duplicated.
11315560	11319680	So serious or silly as you want your 2013 predictions.
11319920	11322040	We might,
11322080	11325200	I predict that I will get through a sentence without coughing or something.
11325440	11328040	All right, let's, uh, let's go around dark Sakura.
11328200	11331520	What is your number three answer for your 2013 prediction?
11332000	11335440	Reggie Fils-Aime will actually reveal that he's Donkey Kong. Just shaved.
11342680	11344520	And why do you believe this will happen?
11344520	11348400	Look at the man's face. He's got gorilla face.
11349520	11353240	And like not Damon Auburn, Jamie Hewlett gorillas. I mean, he,
11353400	11354480	he looks like a monkey.
11354800	11359360	All right. Wow. I don't know. I don't know. That's, uh,
11359880	11363400	I don't know. I don't know. That one might get eliminated right off. We'll see.
11363640	11367080	All right. Let's see though. Uh, moving around the list. Loki,
11367080	11369840	what is your number three answer for 2013 prediction?
11370040	11371600	Final Fantasy 11 will go free to play.
11376440	11379120	And why do you feel that's destined to happen this year?
11379160	11384040	Because there's very few servers right now and they're
11384280	11387240	hardly anyone on them. And honestly, if they went free to play,
11387240	11388760	I think they would get a lot more revenue.
11390480	11392480	All right. And I understand the, you know,
11392480	11395320	they have Final Fantasy 14 over there and they want kind of people to go to
11395320	11398560	that, but why wouldn't you want to keep your old service available? I guess it,
11398560	11402200	maybe, maybe not the cut into your new one. I don't know. As hard as that.
11403560	11408080	All right. Uh, Flaco Jones, what is your number three answer?
11408560	11409080	Uh,
11409080	11412360	PlayStation and Vita versions of first party Sony games are actually going to be
11412360	11415840	made by the same developers. Oh,
11415840	11418760	instead of like the whole like license thing, like, well,
11418760	11421840	just like the whole, like, uh, uh, yeah, like uncharted,
11421840	11424840	naughty dog doesn't do the Vita version or a little big planet.
11424840	11426640	Meaty medical doesn't do the Vita version.
11426640	11429880	Just stop pawning it off on one of your other developers.
11431880	11435480	That makes a lot of sense. Actually. I am like totally okay with that. All right.
11436480	11440240	Um, moving on. Uh, let's go to Alan,
11440240	11443840	if we can with his number three answer. Where did he go? He's over there.
11444800	11445640	Hello.
11447120	11451680	The devil may cry reboot will flop and bury the franchise for good.
11452120	11455680	The only good thing it will bring is really hot fan art of new Dante and Chris
11455680	11460560	Redfield. So there you go. The number three answer from Allen,
11460560	11465040	devil may cry reboot flops and the only good thing it brings is a fanfic.
11465880	11469640	All right. Uh, my number three answer, what did I do my list here? Oh,
11469680	11474560	my number three answer is that there will be a Vita price drop before the
11474560	11477640	one year anniversary, which is in a couple of months. And I honestly,
11478280	11480120	I don't think they have any choice at this point.
11480360	11484640	And I would almost go so far as to say the three G one gets eliminated totally.
11484640	11486720	Cause why? But, uh,
11487080	11489200	I'm just going to say a price drop for the Vita.
11489200	11492600	And I don't think that's just wishful thinking because you're not getting a Vita
11492600	11497000	till the price drop. Right? I mean, I already missed the, the, the, the posts,
11497080	11501600	the black Friday deal, which is 180. So unless it's lower than 180, yeah,
11501600	11505720	I'm not buying it. It won't just be the three DS that gets that.
11506240	11510280	All right, let's go to dark Sakura with her number two answer.
11510600	11514280	Mass effect fans will get all butthurt because, um,
11514280	11518200	the rumor about the DLC, uh, proving indoctrination theory is true.
11521240	11524960	So, um, DLC indoctrination is true. Yeah.
11525640	11528080	And of course, you know, all the fans will get butthurt.
11528280	11532120	I'll probably be a bit butthurt for those that are not in tapped into the fandom
11532120	11536880	briefly described what the indoctrination theory is without spoiling the ending.
11537000	11540400	Uh, not much basically. Okay.
11540440	11543520	There's this thing where there's like a kind of mind control in the game for
11543520	11545240	people who've been around Reaper technology a lot.
11545240	11547640	And the Reapers are the big bad guys. And, um,
11547640	11550920	basically they can kind of make you do whatever they want you to and think
11550920	11554040	whatever they want you to think. So maybe the whole ending was hallucinated.
11555960	11559760	Fair enough. All right. Uh,
11559800	11562600	let's move on to Loki. Your number two answer.
11564200	11568120	Bandit two will flop and the only good thing you'll get from it is fanfic.
11570720	11573240	Well, didn't I just hear that?
11577200	11581320	And because of the Wii U and you think you had trouble with niche games on the
11581320	11584600	Wii, you haven't seen anything yet. All right. So, uh,
11584640	11587920	Flaco Jones, what is your number two answer?
11588280	11591320	The next generation Xbox, the lube, uh,
11591360	11595320	will be a hundred dollars if you sign up for a two year cell phone style
11595320	11599720	commitment and pay a higher tier of Xbox lives, say like 15 bucks a month.
11600840	11602480	That answer.
11602560	11607320	I hate that answer because it is so probably true. Like, Oh my God,
11607320	11611840	I, Oh, I hate you for saying that because like I could see that happening X.
11611880	11614320	So you're basically saying Xbox lube goes the way the iPhone.
11614320	11619040	It's just 99 99 with a two year commitment to Xbox live. Yeah.
11619040	11623480	But then even X, yeah, platinum. Exactly what I was thinking. Oh, you Dick.
11623520	11627960	All right. Alan, your number two answer.
11629640	11633680	Watchdogs and Bioshock infinite will destroy everyone else's asshole as far as
11633680	11634880	gaming the year lists.
11636480	11638920	The only beat the two games that everyone loses their mind over.
11640480	11642760	What about, what about bungees destiny?
11642760	11644080	That was the other one I was thinking of.
11644080	11647760	That's supposed to be a real like asshole blower. I guess if I'm used to use,
11648080	11651280	that's not coming up this year. Salacious pop turn or 2013.
11651280	11653960	You don't think so? No. All right. It's not even close.
11654000	11657200	You think it's either pushing it back. They're pushing it back to the next,
11657240	11662120	next 2014. All right. Uh, going to who's left me.
11662120	11666680	My number two answer, my number two answer for 2013 prediction is, uh,
11666720	11670120	final fantasy 14 reborn. Not bad.
11672840	11677680	You know what? That one's not fair. Why? I can't say why.
11678520	11681440	Well, it's a, it's a prediction. Final Fantasy 14 reborn.
11681560	11684880	Turns out to not be that bad. And it's the first time they've ever, uh,
11684960	11689760	reversed course on an MMO and it works. We'll see. All right.
11690200	11694320	Uh, so, so far we have Reggie reveals he's actually donkey Kong.
11694520	11698840	Final fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita ports made by the same developers.
11699000	11701080	Devil may cry. Reboot flops.
11701240	11705360	Vita price drop before the one year anniversary indoctrination DLC ending,
11705360	11709400	but hurts mass effect fans. Bayonetta two will flop, but yay fanfic.
11709760	11712480	The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with a commitment.
11712800	11716160	Watchdogs and bio shocks blows up game of the year lists and other things.
11716360	11720200	Final fantasy 14 reborn. Not bad gift. All right,
11720220	11724520	so now we get down to the number one answers.
11724560	11728200	Dark sahara compile will rise from the ashes,
11728200	11732320	not as compile heart and bring us a new guard at game.
11733640	11736980	As in guard at guy den was the guardian legend.
11737440	11741520	One of these years, I'd like you to be right. All right. Uh, Loki,
11741520	11743800	your number one answer that we is going to flop.
11745280	11747080	And the reason I say that is because they haven't,
11747120	11750140	they're not going to have any good games coming out and I'm not talking about
11750140	11753720	Pikmin. Yeah. Some people like Pikmin, but Pikmin does not fucking sell systems.
11754240	11758520	Okay. I'm talking about like Mario, Zelda, not until fourth quarter,
11758720	11763320	2013 and so basically you're going to have a big nine month dead period,
11764160	11768440	at least more than nine months where it's just going to dip down to nothing
11768440	11772120	because it's not selling like hotcakes now they're on. I mean,
11772840	11776440	don't get me wrong. They've got lots of systems out there right now. Um,
11776480	11779400	or at least there's, you know, we don't know how many systems they have out there,
11779400	11780760	but they're not,
11781400	11785580	they're not selling out and that's not good to not be selling out right now.
11785640	11787760	And then granted, I know their supplies a little better,
11788000	11792020	but it's not that much better. You just popped in my head. Hmm. Flippity,
11792020	11796600	floppy. We use on its way. Flocko Jones,
11796620	11801280	your number one prediction for 2013 a skyward sword will be ported to the Wii U
11801280	11805080	replacing the innovative motion control with innovative touch control.
11806680	11808240	When you're talking about motion control,
11808280	11810880	they're just going to do motion control with the game pad.
11810880	11813720	It'll be the exact fucking thing again.
11814400	11818280	Skyward have to use the screen skyward sword to the Wii U with touch control.
11818280	11822680	It's new control skyward sword. Yes. All right. Fair enough. Alan,
11822840	11824760	your number one answer.
11825520	11830140	BioWare will continue to support mass effect free multiplayer with DLC and
11830140	11833680	weekend events through at least June.
11835560	11836720	I would like that to be true.
11838520	11840640	All right. From a true fan boy,
11841240	11844320	I was still getting my regular updates through June. All right.
11845680	11847720	All right. And my number one answer,
11848360	11851760	the last one for the list before we do the elimination rounds,
11853120	11857200	no PlayStation four this year.
11857680	11861040	I think everybody's expecting it to happen. I don't think it will.
11861240	11864320	That's a very serious reply. I think the new X-Box will happen.
11864360	11868320	I don't think Sony Sony needs to recover on the Vita right now.
11868400	11871000	I don't think they're under any pressure to get the PlayStation four out.
11872080	11874640	Try to learn from the Wii U and the X-Box launches.
11874680	11878480	I think it's the smart thing to wait if you're Sony, but we'll see.
11878560	11882160	I say no PlayStation four in 2013. All right.
11882160	11886040	So there it is 15 things on the damn list right now.
11886400	11891040	Reggie is donkey Kong. Final Fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita ports made by the
11891080	11894800	same developers as PS three devil may cry. Reboot flops.
11894880	11898800	Beat a price drop before the one year anniversary DLC indoctrination ending,
11898800	11902360	but hurts mass effect fans Bayonetta two flops, but fanfic.
11902600	11906240	The X-Box lube is a hundred dollars with the commitment watchdogs and bio shot
11906240	11909460	game of the year list final fantasy reborn. Not bad.
11909460	11913120	JPG compile will rise from the ashes with a new guard at game.
11913360	11918280	Wii U will flop skyward sword goes to Wii U with touch control mass effect
11918280	11922240	multiplayer through June and no PlayStation four.
11922440	11926640	Now we get to the very tough part of the round.
11932320	11935960	All right. That's actually not the music I would have used.
11936840	11939440	Some of these YouTube's are labeled very strangely.
11939600	11943760	Let's do this theme song here. Let's try this for the vote off.
11945360	11946200	Much better.
11948960	11951000	All right, so here we are at tribal council.
11952880	11957240	Will you tell me about how Russell wronged you and how you're going to vote his
11957240	11960160	ass out tonight? All right, for real. Here we go.
11960160	11963160	Going around and eliminating items that are not worthy of the list.
11963160	11966320	Remember if two of a person's items get eliminated,
11966320	11969160	the third answer becomes immune. So dark soccer,
11969160	11970680	which of these is not worthy of the list?
11972000	11975720	Um, sorry, Alan.
11975720	11980000	I'm going to take out the devil may cry reboot because there is such a huge fan
11980000	11982640	base that it will make its money back just from fan base alone.
11983400	11985440	But the fanfic, dark soccer, the fanfic.
11985480	11988400	Yeah, the fanfic will happen regardless.
11989160	11993120	People will still buy the game. I bought orphan Rob.
11993160	11995840	It doesn't take a miss Clio to predict. I bought orphan. All right.
11995880	11999360	Hey, you played a demo yet? Fair enough. Huh? Uh, I've seen it.
11999360	12003840	I haven't played it myself. Dante's pretty hot. Don't get me wrong. All right.
12003920	12008640	Uh, who is next? Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list? Um,
12008760	12010800	I'm going to have to say,
12013960	12016840	uh, compile it. It's just, it's not, it's not going to happen.
12016840	12020600	We've got to be real here. All right. Compile rising from the ashes.
12020640	12023960	It just ain't happening. It's a wonderful pipe dream, but it's just,
12023960	12027040	it's not going to happen. All right. Fair enough. Uh,
12027080	12031600	then we will go to a Flaco. Which of these is not worthy of the list?
12031840	12034680	I can't decide cause they're all going to happen. Um,
12035400	12039920	I guess I'll just have to give dark soccer immunity and say indoctrination.
12040200	12041920	You're going to take indoctrination off the list.
12042200	12046520	You're going to give Reggie is actually a shaved donkey Kong immunity because I'm
12046520	12047360	a little,
12047480	12050760	there's something about that answer that worries me a little bit.
12051160	12054520	I don't want to go there. Other people agree with me, but uh,
12055680	12059360	I think he looks like a gorilla. I know.
12059440	12062240	I really want to just get that answer off the list.
12062240	12065680	I don't want to give an immunity. So Flaco, I'm going to really change my answer.
12065680	12069480	Thank you. So you're changing your answer. Reggie. All right. That's a good,
12070600	12074280	that's a good mass effect. All right. So that gets immunity.
12074280	12077680	So mass effect gets immunity. There we go. I should have added that, you know,
12077680	12081560	what was it? Um, who was it that they always have during those? Uh,
12082520	12084120	Oh, it's a water.
12084200	12086600	It was going to be holding like a human head the next, uh,
12086640	12089240	Nintendo conference thing that they do because he's always holding,
12089240	12091280	something weird, like a banana or some weird shit.
12093960	12098200	Universe of difference between a banana and a head, maybe a shrunken head. Yeah,
12098200	12101840	but it's weird though. He's just like putting it out into the crowd. Think of it.
12101880	12105120	Think of it this way. Flaco, uh,
12105160	12109160	mass effect fans getting butt hurt by something. That's a given that will
12109160	12112360	happen. So, you know, I don't, I don't know if you should eliminate it. All right.
12112800	12115840	Anyhow, let's go. It has immunity. Yeah, it has immunity. All right. Uh,
12115880	12118400	let's go to Alan. Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
12120240	12123560	So generally whenever I eliminate something, the chat room hates me.
12123560	12127720	So I'm really going to try and keep the more controversial ones up and get rid of
12127720	12128800	the more normal ones.
12129800	12134800	I'm going to take off final fantasy 14 reborn isn't bad.
12137160	12139960	Maybe perhaps have some bias. I don't know.
12143280	12146360	You think it will be bad. All right. That's fair. That's fair. All right. Uh,
12146400	12149280	what? I was gonna say some bias of the person who said that statement.
12150760	12153160	All right. Uh, then that leaves me.
12153160	12156040	So which of Alan's answers should I get rid of? No. Uh, all right.
12156040	12159040	So my turn to figure out which of these is not worthy of list. Um,
12160840	12165320	um, oh, did you not get rid of them? I did. You did. Okay. Uh,
12165320	12166760	I'm going to get rid of, um,
12170320	12174840	I don't know. Uh, it's all going to happen. They're all going to happen.
12174840	12176960	They really are. Um, okay.
12176960	12180000	I'm going to get rid of Vita ports are made by the same developers.
12180000	12183760	Cause that's not going to happen. That's never going to happen. That's true.
12184120	12185800	It would happen if they actually wanted to save the Vita.
12187280	12190120	Yeah. They really wanted to save the Vita maybe, but no,
12190200	12191280	that's not what's going to happen. All right.
12191440	12193680	So here's the ones you can actually vote on.
12193680	12198680	We have final fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita price drop before the one year
12198800	12203320	anniversary DLC indoctrination ending, but hurts mass effect fans.
12203360	12206560	I kind of butchered the grammar there. Sorry. Bayonetta two will flop,
12206600	12210280	but fanfic. The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with commitment.
12210480	12213420	Watchdogs and bio shear trample game of the year list.
12213560	12218320	We you will flop skyward sword goes to Wii U with touch control mass effect
12218320	12221560	multiplayer through June, which I, that's the one I really should got rid of.
12221560	12225520	Oh well. And uh, no PlayStation four. So there it is.
12225680	12228100	You guys can place your vote now.
12228100	12232340	Send you private message to Rob Roberts in the chat room with your number one
12232340	12236420	and your number two answers for which of those you think will be the case.
12236740	12239900	And we will tally up the results and get to that at the end of the show.
12241100	12243820	All right. Thanks for playing guys.
12247220	12250820	Here's your immunity idol for playing. All right. For life.
12250860	12253380	It's your immunity idol for life, for life.
12253620	12256300	She's the only one that got an immunity. Yeah.
12256300	12259940	She's the only one that got an immunity this time. I think,
12259940	12264940	I think I should have a queen hat or chocolate.
12266540	12269100	Okay. Alan, sit on Jamie's head. All right.
12274460	12277700	All right. Uh, what does that leave for the segments here? Oh, we've got,
12277700	12278620	we got to do this.
12278620	12283620	We have to do a very anticipated moment here in 2012 because remember when the
12284780	12288660	power went out during the last show that Flaco Jones was on,
12288980	12291420	his segment got cut and he never got to do it.
12291420	12293940	And literally he was in the middle of segment talking about it like this.
12293940	12299780	And then he's like sad because the dark.
12300020	12303680	All right, so we are going to allow Flaco Jones tonight. Yes,
12303680	12305580	we're going to do two of these segments this week.
12305740	12309380	We're going to allow him to do his makeup classic game of the week tonight.
12309380	12314380	So making up for the show that was lost in May Flaco Jones,
12314820	12317100	what is your classic game of the week?
12317100	12322100	My classic game of last May is Chrono Cross.
12322900	12326660	Yay. Good pick. Really good opening theme.
12327300	12331060	Amazing. I have to find actually a Chrono Cross video.
12332060	12335620	One song in there that I really liked. The girls do something in the stars.
12337340	12340020	Yeah. Yeah. That's. And it was an S word. And I was like, stole? Yeah.
12340500	12343500	Is that the ending title theme? I don't remember.
12344500	12347260	I just know that it's a piece I really liked from that game.
12347340	12349540	My wife got me the soundtrack last Christmas.
12352820	12355980	Well, here you go. So you can all enjoy.
12357820	12360700	Yay. Which was the best part of the game. Oh, come on.
12361900	12365660	One of the best parts of the many best parts of the game. If that makes sense.
12365980	12370140	All right. May by square in 1999 for Japan, 2000 for North America.
12370260	12372700	It's technically the third game in the Chrono series,
12372700	12377100	followed by Chrono Trigger 95 and the Japanese only text based game,
12377100	12379580	Radical Dreamers 1996.
12379580	12382020	It's set 20 years after the events in Chrono Trigger.
12382700	12386580	The game focuses on Surge, this kid who stumbles into an alternate dimension
12386580	12389860	where he died 10 years earlier and created a schism in the timeline
12389860	12392580	that was saved by your party in Chrono Trigger.
12393340	12396700	He teams up with a mysterious thief named Kid on a mission to stop
12396740	12399460	a demi human named Links who is trying to use
12399700	12402980	Surge's displacement in time for his own evil purposes.
12403420	12406060	So as you play through the game, like one of the coolest parts
12406060	12408780	is you get to have a lot of people in your party.
12408780	12410700	Now, it's only like the typical three person party,
12410860	12413900	but you can recruit up to 45 people and swap them in and out
12414460	12416060	pretty much however you please.
12416060	12418980	And they all have different, you know, base powers and things like that.
12420140	12423020	But the only way to obtain all 45 of those characters is to play
12423380	12425540	through the game three times.
12425540	12428540	And I beat this game five times, so I've gotten all the characters.
12430820	12434020	A lot of them have their own unique little dialog quirks to do this.
12434020	12437180	They coded a script generator to change the standard dialog
12437180	12439340	for all these special characters so they wouldn't have to rewrite
12439580	12441940	and translate for all the different ones.
12441940	12445620	Another way that the Chrono Cross makes having so many playable characters work
12445820	12449340	is that it's a grind free RPG so you don't have to go grind all your characters.
12449780	12452140	Every recruit levels up after killing a boss
12452380	12454820	or fighting other key battles where you're rewarded with a star.
12454820	12457580	So every time you get a star, your whole party bumps up a level.
12457580	12459820	And that's kind of that's just another thing I love about the game.
12459820	12462780	I love that it's not your typical grindy JRPG.
12462780	12466340	You play through the game, boss to boss, and your party will always level.
12466340	12468780	You don't sit there and grind little rabbits in the field.
12469940	12472060	See, they also built the battle system from the ground up.
12472060	12476300	It doesn't use magic points because as you attack, you use stamina points.
12476540	12477700	And with each successful attack,
12477700	12481340	you gain access to higher tiered elements on your elemental grid.
12481900	12484660	Each element is tied to a color that affects the field of battle.
12484820	12488340	And those are tied to like basic elements, you know, like fire and water,
12488900	12492860	nature, earth and something else.
12494140	12497660	Let's see, based on how you manipulate the field, you can do more damage.
12497980	12502460	And that's kind of received some flack for the game
12502460	12506780	because it is easy in that sense, along with the whole grind free aspect of it.
12507300	12509500	The combat system is pretty easy to figure out.
12509500	12512540	And once you do and you can just manipulate the field,
12512540	12514940	you can own stuff like super fast in this game.
12515820	12520260	Let's see, it received extremely well by critics.
12520860	12525500	It had a perfect 10 on GameSpot, 36 out of 40 on Famitsu and 97 on IGN.
12526940	12528940	The game shipped over a million and a half copies
12528940	12530940	and was rereleased as a greatest hits version.
12531300	12534180	It does have plenty of detractors, with the most common complaint
12534180	12536580	being it isn't Chrono Trigger 2.
12536580	12539620	The game's creators never intended it to be a true sequel to Chrono Trigger
12539860	12544300	as they wanted to build a new game from the ground up for this new platform.
12544300	12547740	You know, the PlayStation one that were not new at that point,
12547740	12549780	but new compared to Chrono Trigger.
12549780	12551980	They wanted they didn't want to just have another game
12551980	12554940	that looked like Chrono Trigger playing on the the PlayStation.
12556020	12559380	Well, plus, there was such a difference between Final Fantasy six and seven.
12559380	12561620	You know, Chrono made a very similar kind of jump.
12561860	12565220	And you know, in the game, I think also pissed off a lot of fans
12565220	12569620	because as you play the game, you realize some characters from Chrono Trigger died.
12569940	12572620	So you're like, oh, so that means there probably can never be a true
12572620	12575100	Chrono Trigger 2 because this person's dead.
12575100	12576140	But, you know, it's time travel.
12576140	12579300	So you never know. Chrono Trigger could come back maybe someday.
12579300	12580300	They could do whatever they want.
12580300	12581380	They could do whatever they want.
12581380	12583860	It's time travel and it's magic and who cares?
12584460	12587220	It's still a great game. Let's see.
12587220	12591260	Oh, yeah. OK. And then this is what I was going to end on was the music is the best.
12591820	12593220	Nobody can really complain about that.
12593220	12594420	It's my favorite part of the game.
12594420	12596340	And I got the soundtrack.
12596340	12598580	Like I said, the highlights are time scar.
12598740	12600340	And I love magical dreamers.
12600340	12601660	I love the end credits song.
12601940	12605780	And yeah, just the kind of game you can just sit and listen to the music to.
12605780	12609260	If you you can just leave it on that menu screen and just let it go.
12609540	12611180	And that's just time scar over and over and over.
12611180	12612700	Attract mode. Yeah.
12612700	12616140	On Chrono Trigger, I used to let it sit in zeal
12616620	12619300	and just play that music over and over again.
12619580	12621220	And Charlotte's music.
12621220	12622860	Yeah. Oh, Charlotte seems my favorite.
12622860	12624460	Yeah. I love that.
12624460	12626460	They kept just that awesome.
12626460	12630180	This musical style was it kept the same style, at least.
12630420	12632500	And she plays a big role in Chrono Cross.
12633300	12635220	You know, I never got that far into it.
12635220	12636980	Oh, you know what, though?
12636980	12641700	But I've got another it's another critique of the game that it's almost like they
12641700	12645420	didn't they could have changed one little thing about a certain character in Chrono
12645420	12647100	Cross, and I think it would have made a huge difference
12647820	12650340	to maybe fans of Chrono Trigger and Charlotte.
12651220	12652580	But I guess you got to play it.
12652580	12655940	I'm not going to spoil it, even though this game is like 12 years old or whatever.
12656580	12657740	All right. Well, there it is.
12657740	12661300	Your classic game of the May classic game in the May Chrono Cross.
12661300	12662020	Thank you for that.
12662020	12664220	I'm glad you finally got to give give the game.
12664220	12666340	It's due here. I love this game.
12666340	12669620	I know we all love the game.
12669620	12670820	We're going to open up the Skype line.
12670820	12673780	We don't have a whole lot of time for calls tonight because we're running very long.
12673780	12675380	It's damn near a four hour show tonight.
12675380	12678180	So one eight seven seven game O.L.R.
12678180	12680020	or is your name on Skype is Orange Laundry.
12680020	12682020	All one word. If you want to give us a call
12682020	12685340	and we will take some of your calls, we will do the listless results here shortly.
12685340	12687540	I just want to give it one more minute for votes
12687820	12689820	because we have a massive tie going on right now.
12689820	12691460	So I just want to see if that tie will get broken.
12691460	12693700	But it doesn't look likely at this point.
12693700	12694500	So we'll see.
12694500	12698300	I'm also going to do tweets real quick here at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R..
12698780	12700300	But I need my iPad for that.
12700300	12702100	So, Loki, do you have any last minute story?
12702100	12703780	Probably not, huh? No, I do.
12703780	12705700	Oh, OK. I have one.
12705700	12708860	Oh, Rob, see, this is kind of this is kind of sad, actually.
12709140	12710500	You may remember the last few years.
12710500	12713140	We haven't had a new NBA game, NBA elite.
12713140	12719020	Well, NBA, NBA, NBA game like NBA live or NBA elite or whatever you can call it.
12719660	12724020	So NBA Live 10, the last NBA game released by EA
12724620	12728460	is going to have its online support shut down January 11th.
12729220	12733220	So if you're still playing NBA live, you're done.
12733220	12736300	But go act really angry on the Internet, because apparently that works.
12736300	12737700	It worked with GameSpy.
12737700	12740140	You never know. All right. We have a call on the line. Let's get to it.
12740140	12743020	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hello, it's Shane.
12743020	12745220	Hey, Shane, how you doing? I'm good.
12745540	12748420	Did you like the Konami stories that Jim was telling us earlier?
12748420	12752380	There are so many other ones that are really funny that he missed.
12752380	12755620	Like the fact there was the one guy
12755620	12758700	when we were doing karaoke revolution that couldn't sing at all.
12759060	12761980	And nobody could be in the same room with him while he tested
12761980	12763700	because we would all laugh too hard.
12763700	12766860	So we'd have to go other places like me and one of the guys had to go
12766860	12769780	in the storage closet because we wanted to laugh so hard at it.
12771140	12772260	I forgot about that.
12772260	12774580	There was a guy that was so bad at karaoke revolution.
12774580	12777860	It sent you back in the closet. Yes. All right. Amazing.
12777860	12780380	All right. What did you really call in to talk about tonight?
12780380	12784100	One, you did not pick the right number one for your list list
12784100	12787740	as I gave you a better number one that is probably more likely to happen
12787740	12791020	than anything on the list list. What would what would that answer be?
12791940	12795540	Verbatim, I put your number one will be Shane will find a game
12795540	12799020	he loves and gets Rob and Jamie to fall madly in love with it as well.
12800900	12803540	Only if it's more mass effect.
12803540	12807380	That's what you say now until I find something he's trying with persona
12807380	12808940	and I'm like, no, no, not yet.
12808940	12812900	I will not try yet until I beat it, but it will happen. Whatever.
12813460	12814420	It's really, really good.
12814420	12815780	Not worked with Skylanders.
12815780	12816540	I'm not doing that.
12816540	12819620	I'm not going to try to get you into Skylanders.
12819620	12820740	I promise. All right.
12820740	12823780	I don't want to be into Skylanders. All right.
12824620	12827580	You know what I was really going to say is and something
12827620	12829420	I think we talked about before
12829420	12833060	is that when I was doing my own, like, what games did I love this year?
12833300	12836100	My top five, four of them were Vita games,
12836380	12838820	which seemed a little ridiculous to me.
12838820	12841100	So just because the system kind of sucks
12841460	12844100	doesn't mean that the games are awful, too.
12844620	12847620	Let me guess that must be luminous persona.
12847940	12849780	Mm hmm. Gravity Rush.
12849780	12851780	Nope. What else? I didn't beat the game yet.
12851780	12853900	So sound shapes.
12853900	12855780	Oh, yes. Sound shapes really good.
12855780	12859580	And what? Um, and D.J. Maxx. Oh, OK.
12860460	12861420	Yeah, I guess that's true.
12861420	12863380	Those are all still really great games.
12863380	12866540	Yeah. And PlayStation Plus makes it easier because I got four games
12866540	12869540	from PlayStation Plus now on there, too, that I can play and love.
12869620	12872100	This is the part of the year where all the websites
12872100	12873900	are doing their best and worst to 2012.
12873900	12876500	And like Yahoo, I don't know why I read Yahoo, but I do.
12876820	12879540	They have their worst of 2012 in tech.
12879540	12881340	And the Vita inevitably made the list.
12881340	12883980	And there's a lot of websites where the Vita made the worst in tech list.
12883980	12886580	But yet, yet we have the golden rule of gaming.
12886580	12888380	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
12888380	12891100	If the games are so good on the Vita, why is the Vita flopping?
12892420	12893820	The price sucks.
12893820	12900060	And as you know, Flacco Jones says the the first party games
12900060	12903580	that should be made by their actual devs are not.
12903580	12906060	And so they're not as good with the exceptional big planet.
12906060	12907900	I think that game is fun on Vita.
12907900	12909060	I really like it on Vita.
12909060	12910380	Yeah, a little bit of Vita.
12910380	12913500	But God, I'm tired from that, isn't it?
12913900	12915900	They were still involved in some capacity.
12915900	12917460	And I think that was important.
12917460	12921260	Uncharted feels like a bad cell phone knockoff of Uncharted.
12921380	12922500	Yeah, it's terrible.
12922500	12926140	Yeah, that was a big that was almost on my disappointing list,
12926140	12928460	but I didn't really play enough of it to really say that.
12928460	12930660	You don't need to just play like five minutes
12930660	12935220	and then try to do one of the stupid rubbings or aiming in that game
12935500	12937060	or climbing with the touch screen.
12937060	12938060	That's terrible, too.
12938060	12939500	We were talking about this earlier.
12939500	12942780	What would you say was your most disappointing of 2012?
12943980	12945740	My game's Guild Wars, too.
12945740	12948340	I just it was not as good as I was expecting
12948340	12951300	with all the time and effort they put into it.
12952540	12954860	I would even throw in Mr. Pandaria.
12955300	12958980	I have way too many issues with this game, this expansion.
12960100	12963380	I will also say, oh, God, what else did I tell you?
12963420	12965460	I told you uncharted because I thought that was really bad.
12965460	12967380	Both uncharted, uncharted three.
12967380	12969140	Or was that last year?
12969140	12970380	I don't know. It wasn't good either.
12970380	12971740	Uncharted three was last year.
12971740	12975620	OK, well, it's terribleness bled over into this year, too.
12976940	12979820	And you know what?
12979820	12983020	And this is going to be terrible coming from me,
12983020	12987300	but I'm slightly disappointed with the latest Pokemon game
12987300	12988540	because it didn't hold my interest.
12988540	12990740	I haven't even beaten it yet.
12990740	12992180	Wow. Pokemon.
12992180	12994580	I kind of can't believe that you would say that.
12994580	12999340	I know I only have five badges and there are like too many other games
12999380	13004020	I'd rather play than Pokemon right now, which is very depressing to me.
13004260	13006980	Somebody put Pokemon White 2 as their game of the year.
13008020	13010500	Well, that's their wrong opinion.
13010500	13013980	That's cool. How did I know you were going to say something like that?
13014340	13015620	All right. Because I'm a jerk.
13015620	13017380	Well, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
13018100	13021980	Um, no, I don't think so.
13021980	13023020	I was trying to think of another funny
13023020	13026140	Konami story before I got off the Skype.
13026140	13030980	But I oh, one of the times where we went drinking at lunch,
13031620	13034380	somebody in the room I sat in,
13035500	13036780	they drank too much.
13036780	13038940	So they got sent home early.
13038940	13042300	And then as a sign of solidarity, I left early, too.
13043460	13045460	As a sign of solidarity.
13045460	13049300	It also was on a Friday, so it wasn't that bad of an idea.
13049820	13051860	All right. All right.
13051860	13053420	That's it. I'm going to let you go.
13053420	13056340	You can tell more stories when you come to California and guest on the show again.
13056860	13059420	OK. All right. Bye bye.
13059420	13060580	We can probably fit in one more call.
13060580	13063980	One eight seven seven game or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
13063980	13065260	Were you doing with last minute stories?
13065260	13067340	Loki, are you good?
13067340	13069140	I'm good. All right.
13069140	13071860	Reading some of the tweets at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.
13072500	13073140	SGA 100.
13073140	13075060	Matt tweeted us saying I won't be listening tonight
13075060	13077180	because I will be seeing The Hobbit for my birthday.
13077300	13078220	Happy birthday, by the way.
13078220	13080380	Well, and I'm kidding.
13080380	13081380	But I will be birthday.
13081420	13083500	I hope you like 10 minutes of dwarves singing.
13083500	13084740	No, I'm just kidding. I haven't seen it yet.
13084740	13085860	I'm not going to hate.
13085860	13087900	But I would like to wish you all a happy new year.
13087900	13089620	Well, happy new year to you, too.
13089620	13092340	And happy birthday. Let's see.
13093860	13097820	Act Def tweeted us wanting us to know that Austin Wintory of the Journey
13097820	13102580	soundtrack fame released all his music on Bandcamp for Pay What You Want.
13103020	13105500	Austin Wintory dot Bandcamp dot com.
13105500	13109740	That's pretty awesome and great soundtrack for Journey, by the way.
13110140	13112980	Oh, also, I did want to say there is another game that is up
13112980	13117580	on the top of my list is Street Fighter across Mega Man.
13118180	13119580	Oh, yeah, the the fan one.
13119580	13121220	But the music. Mm hmm.
13121220	13124020	You can also get the soundtrack as a pay what you want. Nice.
13124020	13125820	And I have the whole thing
13125820	13128660	burned it off for my husband and put it in his stocking. Very cool.
13128700	13130900	All right. Well, let's go to the phones.
13130900	13132940	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
13132940	13134140	It's the one and only Rama.
13134140	13136700	Hey, Rama. Rama, I was thinking of you.
13137380	13139180	Oh, I was thinking of you, too.
13139180	13142060	Because we need to, like, get online and watch Dirty Pair.
13144220	13147020	That, too. Do you know how much frickin' anime I have sitting on my shelf
13147020	13148860	I've bought over the years and get to watch?
13151060	13153420	I just finished the first season of Sailor Moon.
13153420	13154780	What does that tell you?
13154780	13158420	Really? I've watched like the whole run of it three times now.
13159580	13162700	In Japanese. Just imagine how many people are going to be watching it
13162700	13164820	right before the premiere of new series.
13164820	13167500	I need to be on anime jam session, dude.
13167500	13168780	It's going to happen.
13168780	13172460	Episode 100 is coming soon, and we got some shit in store, you know?
13172540	13175500	Nice. Mm hmm. Very cool.
13175500	13177580	Well, what to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
13178300	13181660	Oh, the whole Shame Stop debacle.
13181660	13183660	Oh, you talk about the porn thing?
13184940	13188700	I'm sorry. I have to laugh when Shame Stop says they have
13189020	13192980	standards and practices on their refurbished machine consoles.
13193180	13195940	I'm sorry. How can you call it refurbished
13195980	13199660	when I walk in and sell it and 10 minutes later,
13199700	13201940	someone comes in and buys what I just sold you.
13201940	13204540	That's not refurbished.
13204540	13208100	Standards and practices is the firing department, let's be real.
13209580	13210620	Standards and practices.
13210620	13212100	Q and reset the whole nine yards.
13212100	13214140	I mean, they don't really care.
13214140	13217460	I mean, I sold them ideas fat with a broken L button.
13217460	13219380	They didn't give it to him.
13220940	13223340	I should have sold them my broken iPhone,
13223340	13226540	but I ended up giving that to my dad because he'll try to fix it knowing him.
13227420	13229340	All they're going to do is turn it on.
13229340	13231860	See the power's up. That's it. Done.
13233300	13235580	Wow. Easy enough.
13236500	13238980	Exactly. And this is why I do not.
13239220	13241580	I try not to shop there unless I truly had to.
13241860	13245140	Last time I went there, I bought NCIS for my 3DS.
13245260	13247420	Come to find out if I waited an extra day,
13247420	13249660	I could have gotten it from Nintendo World for the same price.
13250660	13253740	Yikes. What's been your favorite in gaming this year?
13254500	13257540	Well, like I said, it was Final Fantasy Theater rhythm,
13257700	13260660	but it was a toss up between that and Mario Kart 7,
13260660	13262780	because, you know, I love my Mario Kart.
13262780	13264580	Mario Kart's good times.
13264580	13267100	Yes, especially when we were playing during the breaks.
13267300	13269060	You have to bring that back.
13269060	13270780	Especially on it.
13270780	13272340	I almost said it on a jam session.
13272340	13274540	You probably play it on there, too, but to automate conventions.
13274740	13278900	I'm sure there's lots of breakouts of various DS titles and so forth.
13279460	13283220	Yeah, I mostly see it Mario Kart or Tetris.
13283620	13285700	Right now, the big thing is Pokemon.
13285700	13287460	That's what everyone is doing.
13287460	13288740	So very cool.
13289740	13291300	What about disappointing games this year?
13291300	13293140	Is there anything you want to call out as disappointing?
13293940	13297940	Oh, well, I didn't play a lot of games this year,
13297940	13301220	but I don't think there was anything disappointing.
13301220	13306140	But if I have to, I have to join the bandwagon and say Assassin's Creed 3.
13307420	13307940	Why that?
13307940	13310540	Because there were some people that said Assassin's Creed 3 was the best.
13310820	13312620	So why do you put it as most disappointing?
13313420	13318260	From my understanding, not just ending, but the gameplay mechanics.
13318260	13319660	Some people say it was really horrible.
13320540	13321100	Gotcha.
13322500	13324940	All right, well, we're going to let you go.
13324940	13327180	But good luck with your show in 2013.
13327180	13328300	Good luck with Anime Jam Session.
13328300	13329620	I look forward to episode 100.
13329620	13334700	And when you guys inevitably go live at some point, right?
13335460	13339260	That's, well, I might as well say, well, that's part of what we're working on for 100
13339260	13343420	because of all the extra equipment I've been buying over the last couple of weeks to get things going.
13343660	13344300	Nice.
13344300	13346300	So it sounds like we'll be chatting in the coming weeks.
13346820	13348060	Oh, you got that right.
13348060	13348780	All righty.
13348940	13349260	All right.
13349260	13349820	Take care, buddy.
13349820	13351380	Have a good, have a safe new year.
13351980	13352540	You too.
13352540	13353820	And stay fabulous.
13353820	13354700	And don't get too drunk.
13354700	13355260	I will.
13355260	13355980	Stay black.
13356980	13357740	You got that right.
13357740	13358100	All right.
13358740	13359260	Bye, buddy.
13359660	13360260	Bye.
13360660	13361300	All right.
13361300	13361820	All right.
13391300	13395220	An interview with the producer Brad Foxhoven, former producer in IGN.
13395700	13398740	Nintendo surprisingly gave its blessing to the project.
13399140	13402940	But, you know, because obviously they didn't like Super Mario Brothers at first.
13402940	13404580	But they thought with John Woo it would be better.
13404900	13407620	But I guess they couldn't do it.
13407620	13412140	And a lot of it had to do with Samus' backstory that they wanted to explore, making a movie about her.
13412140	13417860	But Nintendo, I guess, wanted to be the ones to answer those questions, not have it answered in a movie.
13418540	13419660	Let's go to one more call.
13419660	13421420	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
13421420	13422060	Who's this?
13422580	13423220	Hey, what's up?
13423220	13423940	It's Tiger Claw.
13423940	13425100	Hey, Tiger Claw.
13425100	13426500	And it's video.
13426500	13431020	Just like, remember I said, I remember I said a couple of weeks ago that I wanted to get more video calls.
13431180	13434140	And we even have the cam, which we need to get on the show.
13434140	13435460	But maybe in 2013.
13435460	13437580	Well, how you do, Tiger Claw?
13438140	13439580	Oh, I'm doing fine.
13440060	13447580	Earlier in the show, you guys mentioned about the VOG Network Leaderboard and stuff and how I'm still in the top on there.
13447620	13448380	That's right.
13448780	13452140	He's number one for the year, if you look at like overall score, I believe.
13452140	13452980	Is he really?
13452980	13454260	I think so.
13454260	13457060	I worry on Bobby Black Wolf telling me all that stuff.
13457060	13459620	But no, I wanted you to call in and talk some shit.
13459620	13460460	And here you are.
13460460	13461380	This is great.
13461540	13464020	So are you here to trash talk Flaco Jones a little bit?
13464820	13469180	I just want to know is how has he managed to get first place?
13469180	13472780	Because I don't know where he's getting all those extra points.
13472940	13477580	He's doing it because he gets a lot of people somehow to reply to his comments.
13478380	13479820	I do a lot of comments.
13479820	13481020	He does so many comments.
13481020	13482860	He gets people to like him and reply to him.
13482860	13484020	And I think that's how he's doing it.
13484140	13484980	That's how I do it.
13485980	13496300	But he may have to change up his strategy in 2013 because there is going to be some not so much changes, but just, you know, we've been promising we're going to change up the game a little bit.
13496460	13500100	And so the game will be evolving in 2013.
13500300	13502500	So the game has changed.
13502500	13503060	That's right.
13503060	13504340	The game has changed.
13505340	13507340	It sure it definitely did.
13508900	13521460	But anyways, for anyone out there that wants to try to get their hands at the leaderboard, all you have to do is one simple thing is to basically go to the website every single day.
13521660	13522300	That is all.
13523180	13525140	Check in all the check in all the shows.
13525900	13536620	Check in all the shows every day, because there will be a day where you'll get a you'll get a loot for actually visiting the site every day.
13537220	13540700	Don't go giving away all the game secret and all that stuff.
13540980	13543460	And it's a good thing you're revamping the game.
13543980	13544500	It's a good thing.
13544500	13545860	The game's shifting a little bit.
13545980	13547780	We've already said all the strategies tonight.
13548500	13548700	Yeah.
13548700	13551500	And also, please like people's comments.
13551500	13565660	And here's another thing is if someone writes a comment saying that it was a good show, whatever you should like it, there's something positive about your show.
13566300	13570860	I think it deserves a like, I think.
13570860	13575540	I think any replies with lots of good substance are worthy of a like comment.
13575540	13576780	I like and reply.
13576780	13577820	Tyler Claus last.
13577820	13578820	That was a really good show.
13579420	13583900	I like this call that won't get you anything, but it might in 2013.
13583900	13584740	So stay tuned.
13585500	13586740	New ways to play.
13588020	13595180	And hopefully in the future, which I know you guys are planning, maybe you'll get loot for posting in forums or something like that.
13595180	13596780	I could you never know.
13596780	13600180	We don't want to encourage post touring, but we do want to encourage participation.
13600180	13601860	So there's a you never know.
13601860	13602980	You never know what might happen with that.
13603140	13609980	But since you kind of brought up the whole vog thing and all that I did at some point since it is the last live show of the year and so forth.
13610260	13616180	There were a lot of changes this year, obviously, that, you know, they could have gone many different ways.
13616180	13623380	And you guys really kind of embraced this whole vog idea, which in many ways was fucking insane to be doing.
13623460	13625340	But so many of you guys have just embraced it.
13625340	13629740	And like you and Flaco both just kind of, you know, running with the game.
13629740	13635700	And not just you guys, you know, like Act Deaf, Immortal King, all those guys you see, they're just hopping the leaderboards and everybody has been participating.
13636220	13638340	It's just been so fun.
13638340	13641180	And we can't wait to just kind of like continue on that for 2013.
13641180	13647380	And I really want to thank everybody that's kind of jumped on board with vog in the hosting community as well.
13647580	13653340	Brad from Pod Culture, John from Critical Myth, Brian from British Invaders, Travis and Jess from Understation Live.
13654340	13659780	Rama from Anime Jam Session, Syl from Girls Gone Wow, myself twice.
13659780	13664380	But I really want to thank just everybody who's really jumped on board with all the other shows.
13664380	13666700	And we're hoping to expand the lineup even more in 2013.
13666700	13668540	And just everybody has been really excited about this.
13668540	13669540	We want to do more video.
13669900	13671620	There's so much more we want to do.
13671620	13675740	And we're just hoping we can get the resources to do it.
13675740	13680460	Speaking of the live video stuff, you've been recently broadcasting some live gameplay.
13680900	13681420	That's the thing.
13681420	13682460	It's a new thing we want to do.
13682500	13684580	It's a great way to promote and so forth.
13684580	13684820	Yeah.
13685380	13688620	And if I remember, Rob, didn't you get XCOM?
13688620	13690540	I don't know if you got it for PC or something.
13691020	13693660	I did play it on PlayStation 3.
13693660	13695940	I played it the week we didn't have a show.
13696740	13701580	I didn't play really a lot of it because I kind of decided it was something I wasn't like super into.
13701580	13703740	I'm just I'm so bad at tactical games.
13704180	13704780	I don't know.
13704780	13707660	I just also just kind of made me want the old ones again.
13707660	13709380	I was like, I don't want all this newfangled stuff.
13709380	13710700	Just give me the old XCOM game.
13711020	13719940	Next time you play it, you should name all the soldiers after people, you know, and then at some point when they die, you start feeling bad about it.
13720100	13720780	Dark soccer.
13720780	13722700	I just got shot in the face by an alien.
13722700	13723420	What am I going to do?
13723420	13723900	What am I going to do?
13723900	13724860	Die of dysentery.
13726420	13729220	It is kind of the new version of somebody dying of dysentery.
13729340	13730380	I'm getting a look.
13730380	13732020	This is this is why it's too bad.
13732020	13733420	We don't have the video yet, but soon.
13733780	13735140	Hey, two words.
13735140	13735500	What?
13735540	13736500	Bite me.
13736540	13736940	All right.
13737500	13740380	Tigerclaw, I should probably let you go so we can wrap up everything.
13740380	13743340	But I do want to thank you for your support with VoG and everything this year.
13743340	13745700	And do you have anything else you want to get out before we wrap up the show?
13746260	13749140	Well, I would like to wish you all a happy new year.
13749300	13749940	Same to you.
13749940	13755300	And just hoping for bigger and better things for VoG network in 2013.
13755540	13756540	It's already awesome.
13756900	13757740	No, yes, of course.
13757740	13759700	Bigger, bigger and better is always good.
13759700	13760460	Yes, we are.
13760460	13762260	We were striving for more in 2013.
13763380	13764340	All right, guys.
13764340	13766580	So I guess I'll see you later.
13766620	13767220	All right.
13767220	13768060	Take care, buddy.
13768060	13769580	Have a good have a safe new year.
13770180	13770540	All right.
13770540	13771100	You too.
13771140	13771460	All right.
13771460	13771900	Bye bye.
13772540	13772860	Bye.
13773820	13776300	That's a great way to close out the show, I think tonight.
13776300	13777780	Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

13795100	13795540	All right.
13795740	13798860	Before we wrap up the show, we have to reveal who won this list.
13799580	13805580	All right, here it is.
13805580	13809420	The top four as voted on you, the listeners.
13809620	13812940	This is a crazy situation, but we have a top four tonight because

13824660	13826740	Lots of fans of free stuff.
13827580	13831420	Uh, a Vita price drop before the one year anniversary.
13832300	13833740	Again, fans of cheap things.
13833780	13834060	All right.
13834060	13834420	What happened?
13834540	13837140	And, uh, I don't know what this says about cheap, but also
13837140	13838540	tying for second place tonight.

13844940	13845580	So there it is.
13845580	13850820	They're all money related things, but the number one answer for 2013
13850820	13855020	predictions as voted by you, the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.
13855700	13857180	No PlayStation four.
13857860	13858700	There it is.
13860300	13861060	It is done.
13861060	13862700	Sign it, seal it, deliver it.
13862700	13865300	Tell Sony, wait and make it better.
13866220	13867180	Don't rush it.
13867260	13868100	Don't pull a Vita.
13868100	13868980	Don't pull a Vita.
13870460	13871020	All right.
13871500	13875500	Games, games, game developers, developers, developers.
13875500	13875900	Wait a minute.
13875900	13876300	Wrong show.
13876300	13876660	Sorry.
13877100	13877540	All right.
13877900	13880580	That is really going to wrap it up for us tonight.
13880660	13883620	Um, but not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
13883940	13886460	Uh, I want to thank Alan for being on the show tonight.
13886460	13887380	He's in the other room.
13887380	13891060	If he runs in here by chance, I'll let him say something, but Flaco, I'm
13891060	13894180	so happy you made it through a full show and not just that, but probably
13894980	13896660	might be our longest show of the year.
13896660	13897340	I know, right?
13897340	13899460	Well, we had to make up for not being here last week, but thank you.
13899460	13901940	I know you have to stay up late and you've got kids and you had
13901940	13902860	drove an hour to get here.
13902860	13904380	So at least I don't have to work tomorrow.
13904460	13904900	There you go.
13904900	13906900	So seriously, thank you for being here.
13907260	13909460	Um, and, uh, come back again when you can.
13910260	13911140	I'll try.
13911140	13911580	I'll try.
13911580	13912340	I love being here.
13912420	13914380	And thanks for being so enthusiastic about the network.
13914380	13915700	Like for real, like it means a lot.
13915740	13917940	Like you, you, I think I live on the website.
13918740	13920140	That's what we want people to do.
13920140	13921580	So you got to get great talking to everybody.
13921580	13925300	I need little Flaco's Flaco clones.
13925340	13926820	Actually, we have some other people to do too.
13926820	13928100	Obviously we just talked to tiger claw.
13928100	13929500	He's, he's pretty good about that too.
13929500	13933140	So, um, anyway, in all seriousness, have a great new year.
13933180	13934940	Do you have any final thoughts or listeners tonight?
13935660	13938980	Uh, watch community when it comes back.
13938980	13939980	It's my favorite show.
13940380	13941900	Your shirt is great, by the way.
13941940	13943100	The eight bit style.
13943100	13945740	I know that it's, it's from their web.
13945780	13949020	That's from the, the NBC website because it's a, it's an episode of
13949020	13950780	community, they're all in an eight bit game.
13951020	13953540	They need the journey to the center of Hawthorne, but they need
13953540	13955300	to just shop Chevy chase out.
13955340	13957940	Well, he already left the show, so that's the best thing.
13957940	13958620	Watch this season.
13958620	13960820	Cause you realize at the end, he's going to leave the show.
13961540	13962940	The worst part of the show is going to be gone.
13962940	13963180	Of course.
13963180	13965620	It's probably going to cancel too, but all right.
13965940	13967620	It's the last season's running by the way.
13968540	13970900	Oh, it wasn't planned last season.
13970900	13974980	No, it was this, the office and parks and rec, I think are the last season.
13975140	13975860	No, not yet.
13975860	13979380	So I've been official, it's over, but it's not official.
13980420	13980700	Yeah.
13980700	13983140	30 rock is the one that's on his last season, but yeah, they're, they're
13983140	13985980	running, they're going to run their Christmas show in like March or
13985980	13986260	something.
13986260	13988260	It's, it's going to be bad, but I still love it.
13988780	13993540	Uh, why is the civic vampire saying yay, community Annie's boobs, Annie's
13993540	13995580	boobs, hashtag, hashtag Annie's boobs.
13995580	13998220	I thought he was talking about your wife and I was going to be a little
13998220	13999740	defensive for you because you left chat.
13999740	14002780	Annie's boobs is the name of a monkey on community.
14002780	14004140	Don't talk about his wife's boobs like that.
14004140	14004500	All right.
14005140	14006460	Anyhow, got to watch the show.
14006460	14007140	Got to watch the show.
14007140	14008180	Boobs are monkeys.
14008180	14008540	What?
14009540	14011820	You guys are all lost because you need to watch this.
14011860	14012860	No, I don't watch lost.
14014380	14017100	If Reggie looks like a monkey, then he looks like boobs.
14018860	14019780	We're bringing that back.
14021060	14021660	Loki.
14021700	14023100	Your final thought tonight?
14023340	14026260	Uh, my final thought is I'm going to be busy in 2013.
14027260	14028220	Busy bebs.
14028700	14029380	Dark soccer.
14029380	14030260	Your final thought tonight?
14032620	14033220	Monkeys.
14034020	14037900	My final thought tonight is, um, you know, as I always say, help us
14037900	14040740	spread the word about our show, about VOG.
14041020	14042220	Word of mouth is all we got.
14042220	14044180	So tell a friend about what you heard here.
14044300	14047340	Thank you to everybody who has helped make this year a success.
14047340	14049700	Thank you to everybody who supported us through big changes.
14049900	14053220	Thank you to everybody who's continued to support us, uh, supported other
14053220	14057180	projects, supported other indie shows, even if it's like not even a VOG show.
14057180	14059900	If it's just like an indie show, thank you for supporting podcasting.
14060100	14062140	Cause some people try to say podcasting is dead.
14062140	14064620	And to that, I say, hell no.
14065300	14068740	As long as there is a microphone and a computer, nobody told me that.
14068820	14070100	I know I didn't get the memo.
14070620	14073500	So, uh, we'll be back to do it all again next year.
14074380	14076220	Episode 500 next year, you guys.
14076300	14081660	And maybe this by slim margins, although it's too likely, but
14082020	14084740	maybe win the podcast awards.
14084900	14085460	Oh yeah.
14085460	14089860	That's coming up soon too, but we didn't buy a ticket to the ceremony.
14089860	14090980	So I'm probably not going to win.
14092100	14092500	All right.
14092500	14093620	It's good to be nominated.
14093660	14093740	Yeah.
14093740	14095540	It's it's, it's great to be nominated.
14095620	14096580	It feels really good.
14096940	14098140	I'm in it to win it.
14098740	14103140	So buying a ticket gets you like how many more podcast award points to get there?
14103180	14105380	I'm not going to shade the whole thing.
14105380	14106820	It isn't, you know, it is what it is.
14106820	14107140	All right.
14107780	14111980	I, as long as an indie podcast wins, I will be happy and I'm
14111980	14112980	pretty sure one is going to win.
14113300	14113580	All right.
14113580	14114180	I'm in it to win it.
14114380	14114700	All right.
14114700	14115140	That's it.
14115140	14115540	We're done.
14115540	14115900	We're out.
14115900	14116260	Good night.
