14090	18296	Tonight, December 30th, 2012, one console ends production.
18657	21300	Could adult movies really soon be on the Wii U?
21621	23564	And we look back at the best and worst of 2012.
31690	32310	DarkSakura.com
61604	63345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
84136	85037	I need to play more video games.
85057	85557	I've been slacking.
104912	105793	Kirby's Avalanche
123806	125969	No, Puyo Puyo.
126469	128472	Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
128672	128932	Hi.
129333	129994	How are you, Loki?
130274	131255	I'm doing all right.
131375	131636	Yeah?
132517	132697	Yeah.
132837	133438	What's new with you?
134780	135300	Not much.
135500	138384	I mean, just watching a video of Grand Theft Auto.
138684	140026	Just thinking about it.
140386	142007	Even when you're not playing it, you're thinking about it.
142207	142567	It's cool.
142968	144068	Yeah, I am.
144548	147870	I noticed that you brought pizza with you to the show tonight.
148030	150632	The last OLR of 2012, by the way.
150792	153473	Actually, the last live VOG Network show of 2012.
153633	160357	Not the last VOG show of 2012, because we do have taped programming tomorrow, but the last live show of 2012 tonight.
160857	163219	So you brought pizza, and you said it's Pepperoni 4.0?
163679	166280	They call it Roundtable's Pepperoni 4.0.
167181	168682	It's not very good, but...
169542	172144	because they're like, oh, hey, we're going to put a bunch of pepperoni on there.
172485	175607	Yeah, I thought it'd be a lot of pepperoni, but it's just like that.
176048	178350	Really, the thing that ruins is their primo pepperoni.
178390	182233	It's the one that's like, it looks like salami and it kind of tastes like salami.
182273	182974	Maybe it is salami.
182994	188939	It's not salami, but it tastes sort of, it's either saltier and spicier.
189460	190501	It just kind of tastes off.
190701	193103	The rest of them taste pretty good, but they have like these.
194244	194564	I don't know.
194684	196826	It's almost like the full currency of pepperonis.
197066	200129	They have the salami-shaped pepperonis.
200169	202190	They have the smaller, regular-sized pepperonis.
202230	206253	They have the pepperonis you would find at Papa Murphy's or whatever.
208355	211117	Honestly, Loki, I look at that and I go, I want a veggie.
212475	212655	Pepp4roni
242316	243737	All right.
244458	250664	Well, we do have another guest with us tonight live in studio, a makeup visit, if you will.
250824	256369	Say hello, everybody, to the VOG leaderboard, undoubtable winner for the whole damn year.
256509	256809	I don't know.
256849	257770	The month's not over yet.
257810	260713	A lot can happen in a couple days, but for the whole year, I'm sure.
260733	262675	Say hello, everybody, to Flaco Jones.
263322	264102	Hi everybody.
264262	265503	Hi Flocko, how are you?
265683	266424	I'm doing great.
266544	266884	Yeah?
267164	268625	I think Tigerclaw has more points.
268865	273307	If you just take points for the whole year, I'm pretty sure he's got the most points.
273387	274808	Oh, then maybe.
274868	277309	But a number of times on the leaderboard, then yes, that's me.
277449	279550	Bobby has to figure all that shit out in the next couple days.
279590	280531	I don't envy him for that.
280591	285893	But nevertheless, a great showing on the VOG Network leaderboards this year.
286013	287274	So thanks for playing.
287654	288075	Thank you.
289376	290056	I'm the winner.
291458	294200	Yes, you get to come on the show tonight and just gloat.
294220	294981	That's my prize.
295221	296282	A winner is you.
297444	298224	Congratulations.
298244	303229	Well, maybe we'll get, like, Tigerclaw to call in or somebody else to call in at the end of the show and do a little gloating.
303510	307634	I want to hear from Immortal King, too, because he's been neck and neck with you the past couple months.
307674	307994	Yeah, yeah.
308074	310216	He had a 20-point head start right at the beginning.
310737	311077	Well, he's...
311317	312118	That'd be a great trophy.
326761	327802	Well, welcome back to the show.
328622	330183	For those that don't know, here's the deal.
330243	332745	Flaco Jones joined us for a show earlier this year.
332785	334126	I want to say it was around June, right?
334426	334846	It was in May.
335026	335426	It was in May?
335666	335907	Yeah.
335947	336287	Close enough.
336307	336827	That was a month off.
337067	344052	So you were here for a show back in May, and we were doing the show, and we got to the classic game of the week, which is always right at the end of part A, right?
344532	346013	And that's right when the power went out!
346613	348396	Right in the middle of me talking.
360250	361091	Flocko's back!
361591	362571	Yay, I'm back.
362591	364493	Well, the problem was I moved in June.
364533	366494	I moved away from Sacramento.
366514	368035	So I live like an hour away now.
368415	369776	So that was what made it so hard to get back.
369796	370116	That's right.
370156	372117	You drove an hour all the way just to be here tonight.
372137	375579	Well, I had really good traffic, so I actually drove like 45 minutes.
375679	376640	Maybe you sped a little bit.
376680	377801	A little bit, but nobody got me.
378101	378361	All right.
378701	382467	So, I want to talk to you a little bit about you and the types of games you play and all that stuff.
383869	385111	What kind of video games are you into?
385171	386053	What kind of gamer are you?
386293	388717	Console gamer, PC gamer, MMO player?
389318	390319	I'm a console gamer.
390360	393605	I mean, I do play some stuff on PC and I do like WoW a lot.
394045	420462	but I still consider myself mainly a console gamers those are the games I prefer and I tend to like games that have a really good story and gameplay still got to be good but if the story is good enough if it's really really good I can kind of sometimes forego some gameplay elements and I just go for story games because I went to film school to be a screenwriter and so I'm all sucked up in the story and I love games like Bioshock and I love RPGs they always are really good really deep story so
420922	431672	So you must be really into Walking Dead these days, because that's a game that's got to... I finally... We'll get into gaming weeks later, but I finally got exposed to Walking Dead this past week, and a very well-written game.
431993	432433	Yeah, yeah.
432533	433754	I was waiting on that.
433794	435476	I bought that one just a couple weeks ago.
435496	437438	I was waiting until it all had come out, and I heard...
437998	438819	They did a good job.
438839	443683	I want to make sure they did a good job before I bought it because that started coming out, I think, in April or something.
444163	449088	And I wasn't willing to just buy that now and then hope that the rest would come out and still be good or anything like that.
449128	454032	So I waited until the whole thing came out and I bought the season pass, even though the season's over.
454092	456754	But they still gave the $5 off one of the games.
456974	459737	Well, there was a great sale on Xbox this week where all the...
459977	460377	Thanks for watching!
478045	478646	That's all right.
478706	480908	Telltale's done a lot of great stuff the past couple years.
480968	484131	I mean, their only game that was kind of and was Jurassic Park.
484531	490076	But a lot of the, I mean, even then, I mean, I haven't played it, so I'm really going off of what I hear on the internet.
490096	494000	But even then, Jurassic Park has its people that are like, it's not as bad as you guys make it out to be.
494180	494660	Thanks, Rob.
494700	496161	Now that song is stuck in my head again.
496222	496342	What?
496382	498383	Jurassic Park is frightening.
498423	498744	Yeah.
499044	499985	Or the actual theme song.
500393	501434	Jurassic Park.
501554	502414	The Weird Al one.
502434	503715	Alright, whatever.
504516	505476	Let's see, what else?
505796	507758	You used to work in the video game industry, right?
507958	510299	Yeah, I was a video game tester for Konami.
510319	511160	You were the tester.
511360	512141	I was the tester.
513539	514440	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
538500	540162	I did that and I was like, that was really fun.
540202	549973	So I started looking up video game testing job opportunities and I found Konami and I went and interviewed and I thought I did a horrible interview and I went home and they called me back and said, you got the job.
551374	553577	Well, seeing how Konami's been doing the past couple of years.
553717	554878	No, but this was just a while ago.
554898	557241	This is when Konami was doing a lot of really quality stuff, right?
557631	562096	Well, they were still, I mean, they still had Metal Gear stuff, but the stuff, you know.
562656	567522	You were there during the period of a lot of, and this is all common knowledge at this point, I don't think there's any secrets anymore.
567622	569784	You were in the office that has since closed, right?
569924	571166	Yes, Redwood Shores, I believe.
571206	572927	But you were out of there before that happened, right?
573328	576051	Just before they moved to LA, but everyone knew they were leaving.
576451	576952	X-Box, DDR, Ultramix
594009	620677	and Frogger was the first game I worked on it was like the Frogger DS game and there was like a Frogger you know what screw you screw you for all of that you should have told him this sucks don't put it on just let it die let it die you know I prefer to work on those games other than what they started cranking out while I was there which were really crappy licensed games where they would get licensed off of Saturday morning cartoons and do that and I was like the head man for some reason
621557	625300	Because I took it with such, oh gosh, such enthusiasm.
625440	627001	I became the Winx Club guy.
628101	631643	It was a very small game, so they only needed like one or two people to work on it at a time.
631743	634165	So I was the expert in all things Winx.
634205	637367	And I took it and I was like, I'm going to roll with this.
637447	642770	I watched the first season of the show and I was writing up bugs about continuity problems.
642790	647033	It's like, oh no, she wouldn't say that before she went on her first date with Skye because...
648994	649354	DarkSakura.com
671966	676949	I have kids now and I was watching Nickelodeon the other day and the Winx Club is on Nickelodeon now and it's all computer animated.
677029	677849	It looks weird.
678610	679710	And the voices are all different.
679730	681831	There was a British chick on that show and now she's not British.
681991	684533	She's just another purple haired girl.
684693	686174	And now they have another Winx game.
687434	688675	Is it another Konami Winx game?
688695	689495	No, it's not Konami anymore.
689515	690136	It's D3.
690696	692017	Oh, Konami lost the license.
692057	692537	Sorry, guys.
692717	703362	Ironically though, the guy that was my Konami rep at the time, who was selling the Winx game, is now working for D3, selling the Winx game.
703823	704483	So it's hilarious.
704803	708085	Oh god, that's even worse than Flaco.
708465	712707	Flaco just kind of got assigned to it, yet this guy has been following it, right?
713087	716829	Well, for him, he said it was alright, because we've sold these in the past.
716869	720271	He's all, I know about this franchise, because I had to sell it before, so...
721131	750340	I'm selling it again Konami made a lot of Winx games I assume they were selling that's kind of like one of the guys I worked under over there he was like you know it's kind of a that's that's where the industry or at least where Konami was going was like why put a bunch of money into a new IP that might not sell if you can just buy a license and the parents are going to walk in dig well Toys R Us and buy that game for their kid because like oh my kid watches that show I'll just buy it and they don't even care about the game that's a lot of what kind of goes on in the industry heck yeah I mean it's
750860	757521	For better or for worse, I mean, The Walking Dead, again, terrific game that happens to be based on a license.
757901	759022	It worked in that scenario.
759122	761922	Although, I want to say, isn't there like a first-person shooter game as well?
762202	762682	There's one.
762862	763802	Activision's put one out.
763822	766243	But let me say, the bar's not very high for that one.
766783	768323	And I'm worried that people are going to get confused.
768343	771344	The Walking Dead game from Telltale is based on the comic.
771824	775445	The first-person shooter is going to be based on the show, which is based on the comic.
775485	777445	So it kind of dilutes itself a little bit.
777705	778867	So let me ask you something, Jim.
779107	780850	Do songs like this give you PTSD?
781351	782332	Oh my gosh.
788223	790483	That was... I feel worse... They still have the song, too.
791444	791924	Of course.
792084	803126	Well, you know, I didn't hear... I didn't catch the beginning when I watched Nickelodeon, but I feel worse for the people that worked at E3 and had to work right next to the Winx booth because that song played on a loop all the time.
803166	808367	At least when I did E3, I had to do... I got to showcase Pro Evolution, whatever it's called, soccer.
808407	809807	You got to do a manly soccer game.
809867	815909	It was winning 11-11 at the time, but I think they were dropping the winning 11 title because it sounded really stupid with 11 behind it.
816389	816969	But yeah, it's...
818330	825079	that song played on a loop like crazy Shane's in chat saying Jim, remember when we worked on the PS2 PC1 that wasn't so bad to play
825549	826409	No, I have that game.
826889	829990	Are you going to show your kids someday?
830410	830810	I will.
831691	838413	I have a little emulator on my phone, and I have the Game Boy version on that, and I've showed my kids that version.
840053	841473	Even my son doesn't mind it.
841513	842414	He likes it.
842494	849556	If you press and hold the X button, Bloom charges up her flame attack, and it shoots out, and it's a pretty animation, so my son likes that.
850256	851556	But yeah, I have the PC version.
851616	854737	I think I tried to show it to a bunch of friends, and they were like, this is horrible.
855818	873570	out of all the games we played that was the best one out of all the Winx games it was the most like a game and then later on they just started making mini game collections that were horrible yeah really bad but the first couple games they actually tried to make real games and then like oh we don't need to do that let's save even more money just make mini games
875529	881454	Alright, I guess some of our live listeners... You carry a curse with you, apparently, Flocko, because, you know, you shut off the power that one time.
881874	884557	Apparently, some of our live listeners are getting dropped right now.
884637	886398	I don't know what's up, but... And that hasn't happened for a while, has it?
886418	888260	It hasn't happened ever since we got the new router, I don't know.
888280	889941	So, turn off your porn torrents, everybody.
889961	890342	I'm cursed.
890802	892143	It's because I brought two mobile devices.
892303	898148	Well, also, I want to point out, I'm showing that the feed is still going, and we haven't had... Usually, if we have a big drop, I see it.
898248	901031	It goes disconnect, da-da-da-da-da, and like... But we're...
901371	902852	We're okay for right now, so we'll see.
903472	903752	All right.
906013	906393	Anyhow.
907414	908214	Oh, now there it goes.
908694	909575	There's the reconnect.
910615	911195	Good times.
911255	911856	Live radio.
912656	913196	What can you do?
913977	916218	We are going to press forward best we can.
916678	918298	No one ever gets to hear me tell my story.
919339	920619	But no, you'll have it on the podcast.
920659	921200	No, that's good.
921320	922360	Damn you, Konami.
922380	924481	I think they're the ones shutting me down.
924521	925422	Oh, he's talking about the wigs.
925442	925822	Turn it off.
925842	926322	Turn it off.
926342	927983	Do you think they're DDoSing us right now?
928023	928363	Yes.
931246	932847	Alright, let me tell the chatters to calm down.
933488	933868	Alright.
934328	936690	Untwist your panties, everybody.
938191	938971	The world is fine.
939792	940052	Alright.
940733	943775	Anyhow, barring a power outage, which you never know might happen.
943855	946997	Alright, so you did the testing stuff for a while.
947037	950459	You did the Winx, you did Frogger, you didn't do DDR, but okay, you did some of this cool stuff.
950479	951200	A little Metal Gear.
951480	953661	But you don't do game industry stuff anymore, right?
953942	958605	No, no, I got out of that when I graduated film school and...
959225	959765	Thanks for watching!
976650	978671	Try not to get killed and make movies.
979131	983873	And in this whole very interesting, it's a small world type of thing, you married Extover's sister.
984093	984313	Yes.
984333	984834	From Horde House.
985114	986354	Extover from Horde House.
986434	987555	So he's my brother-in-law.
987575	991777	The guy who comes on here and talks about all sorts of nasty stuff.
991837	992497	That's awesome, though.
992517	993437	Bleached assholes.
993497	994518	Yes, there we go.
994558	995178	I was going to say that.
995218	999780	Who doesn't do any of that in real life around, especially family and stuff?
999960	1000180	Oh, no.
1000220	1000661	Yeah, yeah.
1000701	1000921	Never.
1001261	1001581	Never.
1001621	1002822	That's why he gets it out.
1002922	1003342	Yeah.
1003982	1007447	He has Tourette's, but it only takes place when he's doing a podcast.
1008028	1009870	Well, that's not true.
1009951	1011573	Usually when he's hanging out with friends, too.
1011773	1013355	Or when he's at a theme park on a roller coaster.
1015213	1018936	So the game testing stuff for you was just kind of like a bridge from one thing to another, right?
1018996	1020176	It was a college job, really.
1021017	1026300	I was not the kind of guy who could go to school and not work because I had to pay for my rent and everything.
1026320	1030123	I didn't have a ton of financial aid, so I had to have a full-time job.
1030223	1034686	So it was crazy because I lived in... Well, it's kind of confusing to say this to people who don't know, but I lived...
1035166	1039210	in Concord, and I worked in Redwood City, and I went to school in San Francisco.
1039490	1047638	So on Thursdays, especially, I do this like Triangle of Doom where I took Bart to Caltrain and went all the way down to Redwood City.
1048118	1051281	It was like hours on commuting just to go back and forth.
1051301	1054784	I'd leave the house at like 6 in the morning and get home at 5.
1055965	1056646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1072236	1072536	All right.
1072937	1074037	Well, people do what they gotta do.
1075879	1076459	Let me ask this.
1078641	1083544	What kind of, like, are there any, like, really funny stories about, like, what might have happened, like, going into your favorite game?
1083684	1088648	Like, crazy testing behind-the-scenes story, like, you know, not safe for work type things?
1089708	1092651	Gosh, I don't want to, like, throw anybody under the bus.
1094011	1094732	Don't say their name.
1095893	1101297	Some people, you know, if... Unless it was Shane, then by all means, say his name.
1102137	1105519	We would, we would, it was, it was a nice relaxed like workplace.
1105579	1109160	It wasn't, I heard Sony was like a, was like a sweatshop, but I don't know.
1109180	1119145	I didn't really work there, but I heard it was like a sweatshop and it wasn't fun, but we would go out on lunch and we get some drinks and we come back and it's like, oh, it's post lunch nap time.
1119185	1125087	And look at all these DDR pads make wonderful blankets and you know, just stuff like that.
1125147	1127128	But you know, I'm drinking with my boss.
1127188	1127208	I
1129199	1133643	So if they're drinking, then, like, well, it's not bad if I drink on the job, kind of, or at lunch break.
1134263	1135484	So, yeah, we would come back.
1136105	1137786	But we always got our work done.
1137866	1138747	That's all that mattered, right?
1139127	1141168	And some jobs allow you to drink, technically, on the job.
1141188	1143730	Like, especially if you are the type of person that entertains clients.
1144231	1144491	Yeah.
1144691	1147093	Well, I assume it wasn't, like, a... A prostitute?
1147954	1151316	I just assumed, because my superiors did it, that it wasn't against Konami's rules.
1151456	1153658	So I was going to be blissful.
1153678	1155299	You know, technically, we're all temps anyway, so...
1156877	1157617	Were there any girls?
1158298	1159038	There were a couple girls.
1159198	1159338	Yeah?
1159358	1159439	Yeah.
1159639	1160019	That's good.
1160239	1164682	Some of them I still know, like Facebook friends with and Twitter friends and whatnot.
1165262	1166763	Was it kind of a fraternity environment?
1166823	1168304	That's what I hear about some testing things.
1168344	1172986	I mean, even though there were girls too, they're just some of the bros too, right?
1173306	1174427	Yeah, I guess a little bit.
1174987	1176909	I don't think it was too crazy there.
1176949	1177249	I don't know.
1177269	1184553	Maybe I hung out with the wrong crowd, but I had friends who were girls, friends who were gay, and it didn't seem like it was too much of a frat house thing.
1184713	1190799	Well, I don't mean necessarily like... I didn't know if it was like that company you talked about a couple weeks ago where they had strippers at their holiday party.
1190859	1191680	It wasn't like that.
1191700	1194322	That's a holiday party.
1194402	1195143	That's for the best.
1196885	1197345	I mean, I don't know.
1197365	1206274	I mean, it was definitely like a fun place to work, but it wasn't a total... I mean, yeah, it was a lot of guys there, but it wasn't like that Adam Sandler Mama's Boy movie.
1206314	1207495	We weren't all like that.
1208536	1211999	I just want to say you told me a story one time and I don't remember if it was on the show or not on the show.
1212039	1215021	Maybe this was even you about some guy who came to work with no pants on or something.
1215261	1216182	Oh, that was not me.
1216462	1217142	So I don't know.
1217743	1222486	We did have a guy who come to work and I had a friend who worked there and he noticed this and he had to tell me.
1222506	1223707	He's like, we had a guy who came to work.
1224048	1226930	He wore like just a white undershirt basically for a shirt.
1227710	1229572	And my friend would tap me on the shoulder.
1229592	1234876	He's like, I hate it when he wears that shirt because all I can stare at are his big, dark Asian nipples.
1234896	1235696	Yeah.
1237984	1243406	I wish you would put a darker shirt on because I hate staring at his big dark Asian nipples.
1247007	1250288	So yeah, but I don't know about anyone who came to work without any pants on.
1250328	1253889	See, once again, I was probably not hanging out with the right crowd.
1254109	1259211	Shane is yelling out in chat who it was, but since I don't want to, I got to be careful.
1259231	1260572	Are you in the chat room?
1261272	1262572	Okay, yeah, I am now.
1262832	1263533	I guess I wasn't.
1264313	1264553	Okay.
1264573	1264673	Okay.
1264853	1269057	TigerClaw asks, during your time as a tester, did the company make you do some testing that was out of the ordinary?
1282348	1283529	I'm not sure how to take that question.
1283569	1285009	What would be considered... You know what?
1285329	1297534	One thing that they asked me to do that was kind of cool actually was I got to take a dev kit home because we had to test Metal Gear online and they wanted to test it with people's different service providers and stuff like that.
1297574	1298674	And so it was a big deal.
1298694	1299614	I had to sign up for paperwork.
1299775	1300775	Maybe I shouldn't talk about it, but whatever.
1301495	1319021	I'd sign a bunch of paperwork and take the system home and actually got to test Metal Gear 3 online from home and that was really fun and like no one's supposed to be there of course my roommate was right there he's like oh this is awesome like be quiet yeah exactly we get on a conference call and we would all talk and then we were playing with the Japanese uh
1319441	1322824	Playtesters 2 and they were like just murdering us because they'd already gotten to test the game.
1322864	1324885	We were just testing online functionality really.
1325245	1326486	They'd already tested it over in Japan.
1327067	1329629	We didn't get the AAA titles in Redwood City usually.
1329669	1331790	It was those like Metal Gear stuff that was done in Japan.
1331870	1332811	That's not so secretive.
1332871	1334192	That's not that bad.
1334252	1338595	At the time, you know, people want to know everything about a game like that and yeah, you gotta be careful.
1338755	1342938	But I don't remember ever being like told to test something like in some weird way.
1342958	1343238	I don't know.
1343258	1344479	But yeah, it was just taking it home.
1344519	1348162	That was kind of cool but I didn't expect to ever be able to do testing at home.
1348462	1371413	uh Ragenator says paternity testing would be testing us out of the ordinary he's not on the Mori show Ragenator yeah I didn't have to do any of that like I'm trying to think because the only the one story that always sticks out with me is just because the game was so terrible was that 25 to life and how like you know bad that game was or whatever and you were telling oh my gosh that's right crime life I think it was crime life I'm sorry yeah that was a game I didn't test it
1371573	1380599	But in the downtime, when I didn't get laid off, the next time there was downtime, they kind of have you just test games that are already out and really buggy or they just have old builds of.
1380959	1383341	And so to keep our skills, you know, kind of tight.
1384922	1388644	So Crime Life was a game where it was a Grand Theft Auto ripoff, I guess.
1388945	1392667	But you could throw like every box into this one room and then trigger a cutscene.
1392727	1396310	And the guys are like, they get stuck trying to walk through like a million boxes.
1396330	1398971	And that game was so bad.
1399292	1400172	Like, I don't think it was ever released.
1400192	1401353	I think it was just released in Europe.
1402174	1403515	No, it came out on an Xbox.
1403535	1405616	It came out on an Xbox, but yeah, it was very delayed.
1405637	1406677	I don't know anything about that game.
1406737	1407938	I just know it was terrible.
1408139	1413863	You know, despite all these extreme stories we're telling and so forth, you seem very positive and happy about the whole experience.
1413884	1417386	Would you say that you had a good experience doing that whole thing?
1417647	1419969	Yeah, that was one of my favorite jobs I've ever had.
1420329	1425393	My favorite, I guess, odd job that I've ever had that I had to go through to get myself through college.
1425433	1427275	I worked there for like two years.
1427495	1430016	However, my friend pays his bills by being a video game strategy guide writer.
1453792	1454753	Hey, whatever does it.
1454773	1455753	They wrote the one for Mass Effect 3.
1455813	1457254	He says he can't play that game anymore.
1458795	1461016	So... You gotta do what you gotta do.
1461056	1464277	There's a lot of playing the same game, but it's just how you deal with that.
1464737	1465858	And if you just have fun with it.
1465898	1467599	Like I said, I had fun with the Winx.
1467659	1470540	I was put on this game that... Yeah, you had a positive attitude about it.
1470560	1473182	You're like, I get to be lead tester, even if it's the Winx.
1473322	1473822	I don't care.
1473922	1477624	Yeah, if you don't have a positive attitude, then yeah, that job could be horrible because you could just be like...
1478164	1492575	Oh, I'm playing Frogger, and this is something I had to do in Frogger that was kind of annoying, and maybe this goes back to that question Tigerclaw had, was they're like, we have all this time to test still, now jump on every tile in the game.
1492675	1496138	So every square, every tiny little piece that you could jump on,
1496738	1497738	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1524631	1525652	You can achieve anything.
1525772	1526272	That's right.
1526513	1527233	Believe in your dreams.
1527934	1529055	The more you know.
1530035	1530336	All right.
1530596	1534539	Well, thank you, Flacco, for giving us a little bit of the 10-year-old behind-the-scenes dirt.
1534559	1535200	We appreciate it.
1536260	1537842	So now you're doing other stuff.
1537862	1539403	You're doing stuff that's a little more with the film.
1539903	1540364	Yeah, yeah.
1540444	1545248	Education and video, telecourses, ITV classes, things like that.
1545308	1545408	It's...
1545848	1546368	It's pretty fun.
1546448	1550030	And I know your wife is a teacher, too, so you're like a whole little teaching family.
1550050	1554152	We all work in education, and her oldest brother does as well.
1554212	1554872	He's a teacher.
1555012	1556133	Her parents were teachers.
1556153	1558314	It's a very education-based family.
1558334	1560235	So when I got to work at a school, I'm like, oh, this is cool.
1560515	1561095	Yeah.
1561155	1562916	I get to hear all their war stories, and now I have some of my own.
1562936	1566178	Though I'm not a teacher, but still, I interact with faculty and students and stuff.
1566618	1566978	Pretty cool.
1567138	1567579	Very cool.
1567599	1567959	Very cool.
1568319	1568559	All right.
1568599	1572741	Well, you know, stay a while and comment on the news with us.
1572841	1576603	And when we get into the second half of the show tonight, we're going to talk a lot about the best and worst of the year.
1576964	1579565	So you'll definitely be talking along with us there.
1580145	1586949	And at the end of the show tonight, we're going to let you finally make up the segment that was forever lost with your classic game of the week.
1586969	1588249	Because Jamie wasn't here that week.
1588550	1590010	So we let you do the classic game of the week.
1590030	1592772	So she has her own game this week, but we're going to let you do your make up.
1593112	1594613	Teaching is cool if you have the patience
1619911	1622214	Did you ever find a bug in a game you tested that was never fixed upon release?
1633903	1640386	I actually have an answer for this, and it was a Winx game, and this is like... Hurry up and go download it, Tiger Claw.
1640406	1646229	Yeah, Game Boy Advance game, and it was towards the end of the game, and it was a really horrible bug, and it was very hard to reproduce.
1646309	1650251	It took me... I had to try to reproduce it like a hundred times, and I got it like...
1651411	1652152	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1677109	1691919	and they thought they'd fixed it but then customer service got a call about it after the game had been released and this little girl was trying to play the game and it happened to her and she was stuck and I was like the customer service person came and asked is there any way out of this and I was like
1692559	1693019	There isn't.
1693059	1695321	That is a game-killing bug.
1695361	1696841	Sucks to be you, little girl.
1697101	1698982	But it must have been an insane chance.
1699002	1702724	Because it's very rare they have you test something like a hundred times.
1702744	1705225	But it was such a big bug that I tried to do it.
1705285	1709347	And if I couldn't get it to happen one out of a hundred, then they're like, okay, then we'll release it.
1709367	1711108	And I felt so bad because some poor little girl.
1711128	1716110	You tried, but because you didn't try hard enough, some little girl's Winx dreams were shattered.
1716270	1717811	I did try 500 times.
1717851	1721213	She threw that Game Boy Advance at the TV, at the dog.
1723294	1732320	Yeah, if you restarted from that save point, you would still be bugged and you couldn't complete the game because a door wouldn't open for you because you could just walk right through it and then it wouldn't trigger the rest of the level.
1732340	1733660	It's not the first game to have something like that.
1733700	1735081	Zelda or some shit had that too.
1735101	1737123	Remember how they had to put out that fix on the Wii?
1737443	1737943	I heard about that.
1737963	1739024	The Zelda patch channel.
1739204	1739724	Bubble Bobble.
1740505	1742786	Yeah, no boss on level 30 in Bubble Bobble.
1743647	1744727	There's worse things that have happened.
1744747	1745908	Or the Cardfighters ones.
1747589	1747849	All right.
1748749	1750630	We're going to get into the news and all that good stuff.
1750670	1753031	We just wanted to say there was no show last week.
1753291	1753851	Sorry about it.
1753951	1755031	But, you know, it was the holidays.
1755051	1757452	I think a lot of your favorite podcasts didn't end up doing a show.
1757492	1758752	We had a lot of stuff going on.
1760373	1763414	Also, we hope you guys had a safe holiday.
1763994	1770055	And also, Happy New Year and all that good stuff because we won't be doing another show until it is 2013.
1770676	1771956	So we want to wish you all a Happy New Year.
1772436	1773397	and a safe new year.
1773737	1779280	Remember guys, if you're going to drink and drive, plan in advance what is going to be your way to get home safely.
1779380	1780421	Do not drink and drive.
1780521	1784924	Get somebody sober, get a hotel, get a taxi, whatever you got to do.
1785504	1788466	All right, let's get into how our gaming weeks were.
1788766	1791707	I know I had a very busy gaming week, but let's start with DarkSakura.
1791728	1792408	How was your gaming week?
1792916	1794738	I played Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
1795818	1796599	Kicking it old school.
1796959	1803525	Yeah, and then I realized, wait, why the crap am I trying to play this with a keyboard when I could just hook up the Nomad and play it on the Genesis?
1805186	1816315	So, anyway, that was one thing that I tried to play, and I did play some more of that stupid fairy solitaire game because it's stupid and addicting and stupid.
1816595	1817276	Did I say stupid?
1817316	1818277	Because it's really stupid.
1819277	1823679	Um, and, uh, oh yeah, I did play some Mass Effect.
1823699	1825120	Actually, I played a lot of Mass Effect.
1826040	1831143	And I played, um, WoW, like for about 15 minutes.
1832343	1834204	And, um, I bought some games.
1834264	1836105	I got Limbo and I got Closure.
1836165	1838767	I think I got Closure, though, before last week.
1839947	1856120	which is a neat game that uses light to create your platforms or whatever the light shines on is what actually exists if there's no light on it it doesn't exist so if you step back outside your spotlight you'll fall through the ground and you can either fall into another level or you can fall to your death
1857181	1857862	Yeah, that's part of it.
1858323	1863009	I bought Assassin's Creed 2, which is the only game in that series that I ever really, you know, care about.
1863650	1866213	Because it's set in Renaissance Italy.
1866874	1869958	And just, I don't know, I kind of want to gank a Dometici.
1870399	1871200	You know, wouldn't that be fun?
1873271	1874372	Do you know who the Domenichis were?
1875372	1875952	You shook your head.
1877353	1881716	The Domenichis hired Michelangelo to design defenses for their house.
1882436	1884117	Not Michelangelo, Leonardo.
1885258	1885738	One of those two.
1886238	1890180	And I remember one of them used to mumble to himself in one of the Domenichis' diaries.
1890621	1894783	And a bunch of them were popes, and they also were persecuted during the Bonfire of the Vanities.
1896537	1899758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1911623	1939911	I finally bothered working on Flycam so now I've been going around getting compromising screen captures of my characters shooting things and lasers and stuff and I finally figured out now how to get Flycam to work in the cinematics so that's going to be even better lots of fun screens and sort of speaking of video games MassAffecting.tumblr.com picking up some steam there you go speaking of steam more stuff needs to go on sale the end
1942585	1943746	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1946507	1947848	I bought a lot of things.
1948469	1950610	Ironically, though, nothing from Steam.
1951030	1954513	I mean, it is on Steam, but it's not from Steam, so that's a weird thing.
1954913	1959095	It's like, because Steam had a bunch of stuff on sale, but you know who else had stuff on sale?
1959376	1959896	Amazon.
1960356	1964339	Amazon had a ton of shit on sale, and they had a ton of bundles on sale for...
1964659	1966841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1988940	1995265	and then I bought something else because I've been talking about it for a long time now.
1995285	1999428	I'm just like, you know, for that price, I can't pass that up.
2000108	2009355	So I bought and actually played a good 13 hours of Final Fantasy XI and it's definitely different from when I was playing it before.
2009535	2014879	I didn't know what the fuck was going on and seriously, it's a ghost town there.
2015519	2036304	and here's the funniest part I actually tweeted about this because I was trying to get a few other people to buy it it was down to five bucks for everything like the game and all of the expansions five dollars well they're ramping up they just announced the release of the next expansions like the end of March or something so they're probably just trying to get a lot of people that will want to buy the expansion full price
2036844	2038185	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2058616	2061618	Not even necessarily just from the book burning and stuff.
2061658	2067441	I didn't really do that that much because there's no one... You know how you were saying go do the book burning with parties and stuff?
2067502	2068142	There's no one there.
2068282	2069103	There's no one there.
2069163	2069843	They're all gone.
2070003	2070804	In Gusken Mines?
2071004	2071664	In Gusken Mines.
2071804	2072645	There's no one there.
2072765	2075186	They're all like level 99 and stuff.
2076447	2078788	So there's no one to book burn with.
2079569	2085512	So I kind of did it a little bit through one of the tombs or whatever right next to Ranford.
2085552	2085673	But...
2087473	2090234	A little delayed reaction from DarkTetsuya in our chatroom.
2090254	2090714	Wait, what?
2090814	2092434	Loki went back to Final Fantasy XI?
2092815	2093015	Yep.
2093295	2098916	I don't know if it's going to... I mean, I don't know if I'm actually going to pay for it, but I'm playing for the 30 days at the very least because, you know, I got it for $10.
2100057	2101097	And so I'm going to check it out.
2101357	2107779	And it's just... I kind of wanted to have it because I do think it's going to go free-to-play and I just want to be ready for when that happens.
2108099	2110320	FifthDream in chat got it on your recommendation.
2110500	2110720	Yeah.
2110740	2111400	So you weren't alone.
2111560	2112280	Yeah, so good.
2112660	2114361	But seriously, there's like no one around.
2114501	2114961	I mean, there's...
2116482	2136504	I was doing just checks of different places like the dunes there's like 19 people there maybe nobody levels there anymore no one that's that's just not just there there's no one place where people are like I was like okay guys guys in mines okay there's probably people there nope there's like 10 people there huh or like you know there's just it's just a ghost town
2136764	2149449	What I usually do, I go in, or that time, that month or two that I was on it, you zone in the Gusken Mines, see if there's anybody fighting right at the very start, like once you run past the initial cave, and just do a say.
2149609	2152531	Please invite to, they don't call it raid, what do they call it?
2152611	2153351	Alliance or something.
2153571	2154912	Please invite to alliance or whatever.
2154972	2155972	Party, can I have it?
2156112	2157213	You know, the whole auto-translate thing.
2157573	2158973	And they'll just invite you right into the party.
2158993	2159974	That's how it goes.
2160014	2162655	So even if there's only 10 people in there, if they're all doing the leveling thing...
2163055	2190392	I'm also not high enough level to do that because I'm only level 17 right now 17 is a great level for that trust me, people start doing it at 12 I don't know, it's just all new to me so right now I'm just soloing and I'm just going to probably try to get up to 20 so I can get my subclass thing going and do all that stuff and by that time it'll be the end of January and then they'll quit because I don't want to pay 13 bucks a month for it but um
2191115	2193616	It's interesting, and like I said, it's very different.
2193796	2195577	I don't know what's going on anymore.
2195597	2199759	Playing it on the computer now versus what you had five years ago, I'm sure, is a big shock, too.
2199799	2204581	Well, yeah, I can max out everything, and I play on a controller, so I do that.
2204862	2213005	I mean, I have my macros still, but since I'm playing it on my laptop, I just use my macros on my keyboard, and I play everything else on my Xbox 360 controller.
2213566	2216287	I used to have all of my macros done through my top two triggers.
2216852	2230777	Yeah, it's just, I could do that too, but I just don't want to, I mean, I just, it's a lot easier for me just to, you know, take my hand off the controller and do, you know, control one, control two, or whatever, so I've just been doing that, and, um, I don't know, uh,
2232495	2235776	I've noticed some new things floating around.
2235916	2236816	There's all these pixies.
2236876	2239357	I don't know where the hell those are, but I pick fights with them and kill them.
2239537	2242137	Although it's weird, though, because I was resting one time and one of them healed me.
2242477	2245318	Yeah, they come by and they heal you and they randomly raise you, like if you're dead.
2246878	2249539	Oh, well, I've been just pissing them off and trying to kill them.
2251219	2251899	Way to go.
2252119	2252520	Fuck you!
2252780	2253900	I'm going to kill you!
2254760	2256581	I agree with Acidic Vampire.
2256621	2257901	It's boring and it's a chore.
2258221	2259481	I was just going to read his comment.
2259521	2263883	Acidic Vampire says, I went back to Final Fantasy XI a few months ago but stopped.
2264243	2266483	It did get boring and it was more of a chore than entertaining.
2266583	2269324	Yeah, that's what I'm kind of thinking too because there's not anyone on there.
2269344	2274545	But like I said, just want to get the software and get it downloaded and check it out just for a little bit just because I was curious.
2274986	2277786	$10, I mean that's less than a month of actually paying for it.
2277966	2279907	$5 if you got lucky, that's even better.
2280467	2282068	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2298689	2298989	I don't know.
2299630	2300190	It's all right.
2300250	2304414	It's just I wish there was someone to play with, and there's really no one around.
2304574	2306736	I mean, it's just empty.
2306937	2310019	I'd love to come play, but if I hadn't burned myself out on it a couple months ago.
2310039	2310520	No, seriously.
2310860	2313042	It's just very, very empty.
2313082	2316125	And I know you can get AI characters or whatever to help you out.
2316145	2317386	I'm not really sure how that works.
2317626	2318367	I don't either.
2318407	2318707	I think...
2319628	2322530	Something like I said, I don't really know what's going on in the game at all.
2322650	2325352	And I was like trying to remember what I'm supposed to be doing as far.
2325392	2338301	I mean, I know we're the kind of level and stuff before, but I was trying to remember like what I'm supposed to be doing as far as like, you know, the I know there's some, you know, Sendoria quests and stuff that you can do and just I don't know it.
2339482	2340522	I'm enjoying it somewhat.
2340642	2348628	It's just kind of good to just play it and let my mind just kind of go because there's really no... But there's literally no one around.
2348708	2351971	I was just running around and I run across a couple people and that's it.
2352231	2359076	And even buying stuff from the auction houses, stuff you need is just not there because there's no one there.
2359796	2361978	Out of curiosity, is this getting you jazzed for Final Fantasy XIV?
2362651	2362811	Nope.
2364452	2365232	Just thought I'd try.
2365252	2366993	I mean, I saw a video of it.
2367013	2367613	It looks nice.
2369093	2375196	No, I'd rather honestly, when Final Fantasy XIV comes out, I'd rather wait for this to go free play and play this instead.
2375876	2379237	Because this seems like it'd be more interesting.
2379277	2383139	I mean, XIV looks alright, but I'm sure it's not going to run that great on my laptop.
2383159	2392042	I mean, it'll run alright on my laptop, but it's just not going to be as smooth and I don't know how many people are going to be playing it
2394266	2394966	It looks nice, though.
2395107	2398369	I mean, it's just... I like Eleven.
2398469	2398849	I don't know.
2399009	2401330	It's Eleven that I dedicate a lot of time to.
2401711	2403232	Okay, so anyways, enough with Eleven.
2403312	2404272	Yes, enough with Eleven.
2404312	2405133	Other things I've been playing.
2405153	2406413	I actually played Borderlands 2.
2406554	2407234	I went back to that.
2407274	2409896	So I've been playing co-op with my co-worker.
2410416	2411677	So we've been playing through that.
2411697	2413218	And it's actually pretty awesome.
2413278	2415079	So we got a little bit through the storyline.
2415099	2418881	We finally met up with... Oh, who the fuck is it?
2419742	2420842	The little girl that's crazy.
2420862	2421803	I don't remember her name.
2422243	2422563	Anyways...
2426317	2427939	Tiny Tina Tiny Tina Tiny Tina
2447899	2458839	and so she and then she's like okay signal me when you want me to fire these or whatever and she's like I got tired of waiting so I fired it anyways and it blows up the train track and then she's just like
2461056	2463317	The humor and the dialogue in the game is just awesome.
2463377	2465978	So that's pretty cool.
2466339	2467899	And we're just playing through that a little bit.
2468420	2469940	And what else did I play this week?
2470681	2472902	Modern Warfare 3, a little bit more of that still.
2473662	2479406	I got this device called a MOGA, which is from a company called PowerA.
2479426	2483568	They were actually giving them away for one day as part of the Secret Santa promotion thing.
2484108	2490010	And so, basically, what a MOGA is, it's this Bluetooth controller for an Android phone.
2490030	2498054	And what's kind of cool about it, though, is it has this little, like, slot that... Or this little clasp that you can kind of adjust to fit your phone.
2498554	2501295	And you play, like, a handheld gaming pad.
2501355	2502936	And it looks kind of similar to, like, a...
2504156	2511363	Xbox 360 controller crossed with a classic controller because they've got the analog placements of the Xbox 360.
2511443	2519311	There's no D-pad, although the left analog kind of has this diamond thing on it where it kind of does it eight way.
2520211	2525396	It has it where you can kind of do it almost like eight direction on it to make it a little bit easier.
2525516	2529220	And then, of course, you know, the X, Y, A, B buttons and two shoulder buttons are
2529820	2532443	And what's kind of cool is it came with some games with it.
2532643	2544753	It came with Modern Combat 4, which I haven't been able to download yet because my phone... The way they have it partitioned, I've got like 16 gigs on it, but 2 gigs of it is dedicated to apps.
2545514	2549277	And there's no easy way to download something to that open...
2550578	2551779	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2575552	2577293	Well, this would probably help.
2577713	2582777	I mean, and this thing normally, I mean, if I didn't get it for free, it would have cost me 50 bucks.
2583177	2584178	But I think it's worth it.
2584378	2588640	And if you have a tablet or whatever, it will work wirelessly with your tablet because it's Bluetooth.
2588861	2589501	There you go.
2589541	2590282	Which is kind of awesome.
2590302	2593404	So, you know, if you're looking for a controller, that might not be a bad one to pick up.
2594264	2596345	And it's pretty small, too.
2596405	2597406	It fits in your pocket.
2597746	2598367	So I had that.
2598927	2601629	And what else did I play this week?
2601949	2602249	I don't know.
2602329	2602990	I have a lot of games.
2603030	2605111	Like I said, I bought stuff on Steam sales and stuff.
2605451	2610735	I'm hopefully going to give away for some games that I already have or games I just don't want to play.
2611575	2615398	And so we'll figure out a way to do that soon.
2616218	2616819	And yeah.
2617179	2617539	Sounds good.
2617680	2617840	Yeah.
2618500	2618741	All right.
2618961	2626989	Well, I want to move on with our gaming weeks, but I want to say hello to somebody else who's joining us in studio who's kind of been walking in and out, which he's allowed to do because it's his place too.
2627049	2628150	Everybody say hello to Alan.
2628350	2628670	Hello.
2628690	2629491	How you doing, Alan?
2629711	2629952	Good.
2630192	2634216	I'm sorry I was sick last week and closed down the OLR studio with my Ebola.
2634956	2636258	But you're feeling much better now, right?
2636298	2636498	Yes.
2636578	2637799	I had a head cold for six days.
2637839	2638500	I don't recommend it.
2640384	2644766	How did you finally cure yourself of the Ebola super yucky barf?
2645667	2648888	You just wait six days until your immune system gets rid of it.
2649008	2650469	There's really nothing I can do.
2651449	2654411	I bought this spray for my nose that felt like acid.
2655131	2655711	That wasn't fun.
2655771	2656171	It worked.
2656411	2658532	I could breathe afterwards because I think it burned out my skull.
2659153	2661434	Do you blame Obamacare for making you sick?
2662054	2662994	I'm just kidding, don't answer that.
2663195	2665636	I blame coworkers.
2666636	2667497	Alright, fair enough.
2668897	2671779	Alright, let's talk about your gaming week.
2671839	2674680	So you were sick, so that's a great chance for you to play lots of games.
2675240	2676621	Nothing like being sick on Christmas.
2676681	2677161	What did you play?
2677501	2677862	I was...
2679503	2698526	I only played three games really the last couple weeks wow this is more a discussion for Horde House but I have no problems at all with this expansion Pandaria but the magic has been gone for me since like this summer so I haven't been playing it nearly as much as I should but I got played some wow I played some Mass Effect 2 and I played some Walking Dead
2699557	2705641	So, Mass Effect 2, okay, we've heard a lot about Mass Effect on the show, but you do like this mod thing, right, with high-res textures?
2705801	2708203	Well, I'm on my third character.
2709004	2716249	She is my female paragon, which is kind of like a good guy, because my first woman that I played was a renegade, which is more kind of an asshole.
2717029	2745522	so it's my third career and yeah I have all these high res textures for Mass Effect 2 that the community has made and they look awesome but the only problem is is that when you load them up it takes it literally I have to start it up and walk away and it takes the game 15 minutes to load so I if I want to play Mass Effect 2 I gotta give at least an hour to 90 minutes time because if I'm gonna let the game load for 20 minutes I can't just do a mission and sign off it's a waste of time you have way too much patience
2746400	2749166	Well, I can alt-tab and look at Chrome or mess with my phone.
2749266	2749947	Tumblr, Tumblr.
2750168	2750408	Yeah.
2751691	2752713	Let's talk about Walking Dead.
2752893	2756421	That's a game we haven't talked a lot about on this show, but you checked it out this week.
2756441	2756822	What did you think?
2757390	2759292	I don't want to steal your thunder, but it was nice.
2759692	2762915	I was spoiled because I am on Tumblr a lot.
2762995	2773404	When episode 5 came out within a day, all of the animated GIFs and YouTube clips and just discussions were going on my dash about what happens in the ending of chapter 5.
2773985	2777308	So I was like, oh, that ending looks...
2778608	2806096	I'm not gonna say anything about it but I was like I guess I should say that now that I know how it ends and how everyone is losing their shit over how it ends in a good way so I just and then also I saw you playing it and the fact it was 10 bucks on XBLA right and it was 12 bucks for the season pass on Steam and like Steam of course is having its we hate you and we want you to be poor sale so that's a good name for it so despite the fact that you know you had the ending already ruined for you of episode 5 how did you enjoy playing through episode 1
2807034	2807695	It was good.
2808055	2819505	I'm trying to juggle between being a perfectionist and wanting to play it with a fact open just so I can see all the different ways I can control the story in later chapters, which I know is cheating, but I don't have that kind of time.
2819545	2819945	I don't care.
2821346	2829593	And also just wanting to be a contrarian because I wanted to do stuff that was opposite of what you were doing so that I can say, oh, well, if you do this, then this is what happens instead.
2830034	2832516	Because you have an iPhone and I have an Android because I'm different like that.
2833016	2858398	so yeah I was like I wanted I'm trying to juggle between having things be as good as possible for my character but also wanting to do like backwards ass backwards stuff doesn't that sound like somebody you want to date guys somebody that does intentionally the opposite of everything that you do just in video games and he has an Android and I have an iPhone yeah clearly he's smarter than you hey fuck off all right
2859628	2874619	so anyway, sorry, didn't mean to steal your thunder if I'm gonna mimic everything you do when you play, I should just sit behind you and watch you play myself, I'm gonna have different people live than you do, and I'm gonna do, yeah alright, that's fair but you do recommend it?
2875059	2875199	yeah
2876229	2877590	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
2878350	2879031	Tiny Tower.
2880311	2880711	Sucks.
2880791	2881192	No, I'm kidding.
2881572	2881852	All right.
2882812	2883253	We'll move on.
2883273	2886454	So you're going to come back for Part B and talk about Game of the Year and all that with us, right?
2886775	2886955	Yes.
2887295	2887495	Okay.
2887635	2888115	We'll see you then.
2889116	2890737	For now, Flaco, how was your gaming week?
2891677	2899222	I had a very busy gaming week because I have the week off of work and I'm not playing WoW right now because WoW eats up a lot of time.
2899262	2905646	I love it, but I just wanted to really focus on console stuff this week, so I played more Ni No Kuni demo.
2907067	2912229	I just play it because my son likes to watch it because it's a cartoon and then I like playing it too and so it gives me an excuse.
2913309	2916830	I finished The Walking Dead after Christmas.
2916930	2927353	I took Christmas off of playing it because Extifer was in town and he didn't want to see how it ended so I waited and I waited and as soon as he left I finished playing it.
2928294	2928914	And it was great.
2929054	2930134	It was a great game.
2930534	2935816	And I feel so bad that Alan got spoiled on the ending because I think that really helps not knowing what's going to happen.
2937257	2944769	I think I know what happens, but I'm really trying to keep myself spoiler-free, and I'm just kind of trying to forget I heard that and just taking the game at face value.
2945190	2948234	But I'm still really enjoying Episode 1 so far, personally.
2948415	2950297	I thought I knew what happened, and luckily I was wrong.
2950658	2951279	Oh, okay, cool.
2951620	2951880	So, yeah.
2951980	2953041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2969102	2973144	Would this be something that would be alright for someone that doesn't follow the series?
2973164	2974384	Because I honestly have never watched an episode.
2974424	2975685	It has nothing to do with the TV show.
2975725	2977185	No, you don't have to read the comic book either.
2977305	2977785	It doesn't matter.
2977805	2978586	Alright, cool.
2978626	2980026	As long as you know the basic concept.
2980046	2982247	I mean, they pretty much explain everything for you anyway.
2982527	2987769	Because it takes place, I guess, at the start of the whole thing anyway.
2987829	2991531	And you're in someone else's shoes, so everything's getting explained to you as if you were brand new.
2991971	2992391	Okay, cool.
2992451	2994672	So you get the rules of the series and the comic.
2995672	2997213	It's really easy to jump into.
2997293	2997433	Yeah.
2997953	2999755	I don't read the comics, I just watch the show.
3000556	3003419	I don't even watch the show, and I was able to get into it.
3004019	3008584	I mean, it has an ambiguous opening, but a lot of TV shows and movies do.
3009044	3010886	The show, and I believe the comic, opens the same way.
3010906	3017493	I don't think, because like I said, I didn't read the comic, but I don't think anyone knows how the whole thing started.
3017913	3020536	Everybody gets kind of thrown into it, so they start it the same way.
3021356	3039445	Now obviously trying to be very careful not to spoil anything because we have like Actdeft in chat is like no spoilers please no we're not we're not going to spoil we're not assholes don't worry but I have heard a lot of people say like through the Twitters and so forth that The Walking Dead has one of the best endings in a video game ever.
3040185	3040846	Would you sign up?
3040946	3041526	Would you sign up?
3041926	3043907	I don't know about ever, but it was really good.
3044048	3054635	I mean, because you're so emotionally invested in the whole game, then when you get to the end, it just feels like all the other choices you made are all important.
3055115	3056957	And that's a really cool thing.
3056977	3062721	I find that fascinating in the wake of everything everybody complained about with Mass Effect 3 this year.
3062821	3065923	Because Mass Effect 3 was kind of the opposite of that, where everybody bitched about the ending.
3065943	3066143	Yeah.
3066563	3069406	Unless the first time you played through the ending was with the extended cut.
3069486	3071268	Well, okay, but I didn't have that.
3071548	3079416	And before that was in there and so forth, as much as I loved Mass Effect 3, the ending... And I still defend the ending to an extent.
3079456	3082098	I think people blow it way out of proportion.
3082899	3083720	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3108337	3113099	I mean, it's hard to say because this was probably all in development long before Mass Effect 3 came out.
3113399	3119681	But maybe Telltale kind of saw the reaction to Mass Effect 3's ending and made sure, we're not going to do that.
3120301	3121341	Yeah, and it's in the details.
3121421	3125142	Because the actual ending you get, everybody gets the same ending.
3125182	3126783	There's not alternate endings to this game.
3127363	3133145	Everybody gets the same one, but it's in the details leading up to that final screen that everybody sees that's different.
3133425	3136726	And the final, like one of the last kind of confrontations in the game.
3137146	3141748	Very heavy on past choices all the way back to episode 1 and 2 and things like that.
3142088	3142648	Fascinating.
3142668	3143308	It's really cool.
3143848	3145269	I want to just blow through the whole series.
3145289	3147650	You'll get to that part and you'll be like, why did I do that?
3147730	3148950	Or why didn't I do this?
3149890	3150711	It's really cool.
3151911	3161654	They're really just details and it's story stuff, but I think that's what makes it so good because you're so invested in this that when that happens, but the actual literal ending is the same for everybody.
3163355	3165836	Whatever happens at the end is the end.
3167077	3167897	What else for your gaming week?
3168238	3172261	Oh, so for Christmas, my wife got me a PlayStation Move.
3172982	3176144	So I was playing a lot of games with that.
3176164	3178406	I immediately got Portal 2 in motion.
3179687	3180888	And what else did I get?
3181009	3182850	Oh, I got the little big Planet 2 motion pack.
3182870	3186033	We just got booted from chat because there's too many people connected, guys.
3186413	3187995	Oh yeah, I just got booted too.
3188015	3189196	Did you try to join chat, Alan?
3189216	3189296	Yeah.
3189756	3190776	That was a no-no.
3191077	3193117	Okay, so we had five people join chat.
3193317	3195658	So now none of us can be in.
3195738	3197739	Not so fast.
3197899	3198699	Oh, I will.
3199239	3201580	I'll be back in chat as soon as I get my phone up.
3201860	3204381	So we're going to try to get a plan B here in a minute.
3204561	3205722	Alan broke the rule.
3208578	3209799	He's yelling at me from the other room.
3209959	3210899	I didn't know the role.
3210999	3213020	I would have just not been in chat.
3213040	3213920	I didn't have to be in chat.
3213960	3214300	All right.
3214840	3217581	So we're going to try to get back in chat as soon as we can, guys.
3217661	3219742	It's going to be a little bit, though, so just bear with us.
3220602	3222063	But anyhow, let's just move forward.
3222123	3223803	So what else for your gaming week, Flaco?
3223823	3224083	Okay.
3224143	3224924	So, yeah.
3224984	3231986	So my wife gave me the PlayStation Move because I'm always bugging her oldest brother and her sister-in-law to borrow theirs.
3232406	3233467	But they're kids.
3233487	3234247	They play Just Dance.
3234267	3234507	I'm like...
3234767	3235988	But I want to use it because I want to play it.
3236028	3237549	I played Heavy Rain when I borrowed theirs.
3237589	3240790	And then I heard the Portal 2 in Motion Pack came out.
3240810	3242071	I'm like, I want that so bad.
3242131	3243652	So my wife just got me one.
3243672	3244372	So now I can play it.
3244432	3246513	I downloaded the Portal 2 in Motion.
3246573	3247454	That was really cool.
3248274	3249715	I only played like a couple levels.
3249755	3252396	I played the tutorial and some of the levels after that.
3252957	3253657	It was really fun.
3254518	3256379	LittleBigPlanet with Move is awesome.
3257379	3259340	The Move levels specifically are really good.
3260081	3261321	And I played some...
3262802	3263783	Gosh, what is it called?
3263943	3264503	Sly Cooper.
3264823	3266404	Those had just lame move minigames.
3267105	3268666	But yeah, I'm excited.
3268866	3269426	It works pretty well.
3269486	3276010	And I played the Epic Mickey 2 demo, which I didn't like because... Well, first I played it before I got a motion controller.
3276551	3279212	And I thought they were going to fix it where you didn't have to have motion control.
3279292	3283935	And they did, but you have to use the right analog stick to kind of aim where you paint stuff.
3284115	3285976	And so I hated that.
3286056	3287938	So when I got the move, I'm like, let me try it again with that.
3287958	3290619	And it was better with the move, but I still don't like the game.
3291520	3291700	And...
3292000	3292981	What else was in my gaming week?
3293101	3299544	Oh, and then I bought Journey, because I finished Walking Dead, and I'm like, I want to play one more Game of the Year candidate, and I want something short.
3299924	3303286	And I played the Journey demo when it came out.
3303706	3304906	Remember, don't stop believing.
3305347	3305567	Yes.
3306827	3311930	And I actually wasn't that impressed by the demo, but everyone kept saying, well, it's better when you get further into the game or whatever, so...
3312330	3312891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3331849	3340812	Parts of that remind me of Chrono Trigger when you're walking up the mountain and the wind blows and you have to hide behind the trees so you don't get blown off the mountain.
3341152	3342572	There's stuff in Journey that's like that.
3342592	3343793	I'm like, oh, that's so cool.
3344773	3348754	It doesn't blow you entirely off the mountain, but there's some really cool stuff in Journey.
3348794	3350135	It was reminding me of other games.
3350695	3355997	There's kind of a platforming level that's my favorite level in Journey where you just have to climb this tower and I love it.
3357634	3373785	and it was it was a lot better like I played a couple levels by myself because I think it's supposed to be online and there's people like there but I think whoever I was with was way ahead of me and it was really lame like I can't keep up with this guy uh but the second time I kind of started again at that because once you beat it you can start anywhere in the game
3374145	3384073	So I started at that level again, which is pretty close to the end, and I played it through the end again, and I had a partner the whole time, and I even got a trophy for playing the majority of the game with one person the whole time.
3384173	3384693	Oh, wow, nice.
3384753	3388817	Yeah, so it was me and this other person, and I think we were both kind of the same skill level.
3388877	3391599	Maybe it was their first time, I don't know, but it was kind of cool.
3391779	3392259	That's awesome.
3392419	3392620	Yeah.
3393580	3395761	I just want to just a quick note for the live listeners.
3395881	3400003	I did manage to get back into chat on my mobile because what I did is I did over 4G.
3400043	3401084	So I have a different IP now.
3401144	3402604	So I am in on mobile.
3402624	3404645	So I will be able to read chat comments.
3404665	3407367	Some people are still talking about Walking Dead in chat right now.
3407547	3408767	And let's see.
3408967	3412229	Phantasm chat says journey and a point and click adventure game of the years.
3413032	3417795	That's if you believe everything you read on the internet and seeing the TV shows and stuff.
3417835	3421397	Yeah, it seems like those are the two that are kind of taking a lot of their awards.
3421837	3422977	They were both awesome.
3423318	3424538	Yeah, Journey's great.
3425039	3426179	Yeah, I love Journey.
3426199	3429621	And like I said, I was a little skeptical because I played the demo and I wasn't super impressed.
3429641	3430101	I'm like, really?
3430121	3431142	I'm going to play this for, you know...
3431762	3444512	3 hours and love it, well I loved it it's a short little 3 hour game and I loved it so you can't always base your impressions of a game off the demo no, you can't, hopefully Bobby heard that I had to work that in there, come on anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
3444832	3450877	I think that's basically oh you know what, on my anniversary my wife got her hair done and while she was doing that I played Link to the Past on my phone and
3451357	3461587	I'm the last, I've played it before, but I haven't played it in a long time, and I'm in Ganon's final dungeon, so I'm excited to finish that again for the first time in a long time.
3461867	3462988	Okay, I have to ask this.
3463108	3472097	Do you get as pissed off as I do when you're fighting the worm thing, and it knocks you off the platform 57 million times in a row?
3472257	3473578	Yes, I hate that.
3473658	3475600	I hate any time, anything that knocks you off a platform.
3475994	3478895	The first time I ever played that guy, it took me two hours.
3479375	3479935	Oh my gosh.
3480255	3482916	Because I kept getting interrupted by my brothers, and every time, fall.
3483656	3491338	Luckily, I just had the knowledge of doing it before, so this time I was like, okay, I remember... It doesn't take that long anymore, but the first time... Yeah, yeah, yeah, the first time it was terrible.
3491378	3498500	So this time I was like, oh yeah, I can beat this guy down, because I know exactly what to do, and I know what spells or abilities to use for each boss, so it's kind of cool.
3499520	3500661	But that was it for my gaming week.
3500681	3502081	A little old school gaming thrown in there.
3502915	3504776	Alright, let me talk about my gaming week.
3504836	3506856	Some of the games we've already discussed a little bit.
3506956	3510697	I did finally get a chance to check out Walking Dead episode 1 at least.
3511357	3514958	Let me just say this, it was good enough where I downloaded episodes 2 through 5 right after.
3515078	3515879	I thought it was great.
3515979	3517039	I don't even watch the show.
3517159	3518359	I don't watch a lot of TV shows.
3518939	3524961	And, you know, again, I find there's a lot of people that are like, oh, I don't want to play the games because I don't want to spoil myself for the show.
3525021	3530423	So just to be clear, games based off comics, show based off books, right?
3530463	3531003	Or something else.
3531203	3531403	So...
3532603	3534744	Yeah, it's based off the comic book universe.
3534764	3537105	So it doesn't even spoil the comics because it's a completely different thing.
3537245	3539026	Yeah, so they go different directions.
3539266	3542107	And the characters, most of them are different and so forth.
3542167	3543968	So yeah, you got all that going on.
3544028	3546369	So just don't let that ruin it for you.
3547829	3549030	Some other games I played this week.
3549590	3551451	I played a couple of racing games, actually.
3551851	3554192	The game rental service sent me a couple of racing games.
3554252	3556333	And I checked out Need for Speed Most Wanted.
3556793	3557433	Dan's playing that.
3557634	3558354	Yeah, what do you think?
3558714	3560275	Well, he's using his driving rig.
3561195	3561976	The one he set up for GT5.
3561996	3564237	That's going to make any racing game better.
3565217	3566898	He's been pretty into it.
3566938	3567379	He likes it.
3567679	3573222	Yeah, it's interesting because this is a Criterion game, and the last big thing I know they did in the racing world was Burnout Paradise.
3573762	3575943	So it's like, somebody got burnout in my Need for Speed.
3576263	3583067	Now, you don't have the epic crashes and all that, but it is like the whole cop chase is back in there and so forth, but it's more like open world.
3584248	3585029	I like it.
3585390	3586291	It's fun.
3586431	3592380	I like the open world element of it and the places you can go and do the races and so forth.
3592760	3596265	But I gotta say, I played another racing game this week that's a little better.
3596426	3599891	So it's been taking my attention away from Need for Speed Most Wanted, and that is...
3600231	3600712	Sugar Rush.
3601152	3601893	No, I wish.
3602613	3603474	No, Forza Horizon.
3603894	3606336	I've been playing quite a bit of, and it's great.
3606937	3611461	At first, I thought I was going to hate it, because I started playing it, and I'm like, what the hell is this?
3611521	3619588	Like, Coachella Festival in the middle of Colorado, rich, spoiled white kids racing daddy's car and wrecking it.
3619608	3620208	Like, what the hell?
3620269	3621990	Hipster bands all over the place.
3622430	3623151	What the hell is this?
3623231	3623932	But actually...
3624592	3627474	It's... The way they put it together is pretty good.
3628114	3631356	I don't like that you can't customize the protagonist at all, but whatever.
3632416	3633597	That's really a minor bitch.
3633657	3634477	It's not really about that.
3634537	3636678	It's about the racing, and the racing element is really good.
3637699	3641601	I like the fact that they have it set up with a very flexible difficulty.
3642041	3645463	You can play this in, like, racing game for dummy mode, and it's great.
3645843	3649425	Having all the computer easy... You can have the thing, like, do the braking for you.
3650126	3651726	And there's guidelines and all this stuff.
3652187	3652267	Or...
3653007	3653828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3679029	3693653	and as much as I joke about the hipster soundtrack it actually is a pretty good soundtrack so I give props for that as well although my one minor minor bitch is that I hate that the game will not remember what radio station I've been listening to I don't want to switch to the other one but anyway that's a really minor bitch
3694473	3695695	Online support, pretty good.
3696015	3706164	Did some races with Actdeft and Bobby the other night, and we're all in the little VOG club on Forza Horizon, which, by the way, if you have the game, request membership to the VOG club, V-O-G, very easy to find.
3706584	3709166	And I'm an officer now, so I can promote people or whatever.
3709206	3712850	So if you want to join in and race with us, it's a good time.
3712930	3714411	I've been meaning to use my racing.
3714571	3719736	I have a Microsoft racing wheel with the pedals and everything, and I have not used it for anything.
3720056	3721137	I got it like a long time ago.
3721297	3722358	All I've done is paint it.
3737939	3739621	I need screen prints of that to put in my portfolio
3755419	3756260	as the use of the logo.
3757341	3757801	No, it's fine.
3757841	3758122	It's fine.
3758342	3759103	Talk to Bobby about it.
3759123	3759843	I don't know how to do that.
3760224	3761084	So there you go.
3761765	3766249	And Actdeft wants to clarify in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
3766569	3770953	Bobby and I, Actdeft, are leaders of the VOG Club in Forza, so you can ask any of us.
3771054	3771254	So yeah.
3771494	3775598	Well, I think you just ask for membership and whatever officer happens to see it will approve it.
3775798	3776859	So that's all.
3778681	3779601	But yeah, I...
3780462	3802789	even though the whole thing is like Colorado they're able to do some very varied environments like there's a little city there's some really beautiful like there's a cliffside race that was just like where you're going through tunnels and stuff that I was just like oh man this is beautiful look at so um and yeah I had a great time with online mode and I love the scaling difficulty it's it's a great racing game it's one of my favorite racing games I played in a very long time
3803589	3807190	This is probably the first game I've got from the rental service where I'm like, yeah, I want to keep this one.
3807310	3807971	I'm going to buy it.
3808611	3809491	I'm going to keep it.
3810151	3812872	So, yes, highly recommend Forza Horizon if you're into racing games.
3813252	3814853	Not like the other Forza games at all.
3815393	3816413	That's very important to say.
3816693	3818074	It's arcade more style.
3818614	3819935	And I say that's great.
3820235	3821255	I don't know if this is true.
3821655	3827237	I heard a lot of the people that used to be with Bazaar that made the old Forza games.
3827697	3827937	Right?
3828338	3835162	And then they made Blur was the game that shut down that office, unfortunately, which was a tragedy.
3835202	3838244	But anyway, I hear a lot of them were involved with this anyway.
3838945	3841426	But I don't know if that's true or not, but I believe it.
3841726	3842687	I would absolutely believe it.
3843387	3846550	So, yeah, it's great.
3847250	3847670	I'm loving it.
3847930	3848111	So...
3849532	3863050	Now that I've said a lot of good things about it, I do need to express one of my kind of complaints that's a big exclamation point, and it's not so much about the game itself, but it's more about the model, and...
3864111	3865272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3888627	3889448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3904987	3917473	Forza has a couple features in it that I think are a little bit shady for real money and some of that is that you can buy car credits that you can use to basically replace the in-game currency to buy the cars instantaneously.
3918454	3921775	You can buy a cheat map or whatever that shows you all the discount.
3923796	3929619	One little perk in the game is that as you break certain billboards you increase the level of your discount you get at the upgrade shop.
3929879	3931280	Well you can buy a map
3931860	3935542	for real money that shows you where all 100 of those discount billboards are.
3935642	3936903	So it kind of makes the game easier.
3937223	3941005	Or you can just go on GameFAQs or something like that and just do the same thing for free.
3941085	3943926	It's all those in-game cheats you can buy and so forth and what have you.
3944126	3946968	I understand the having different cars as DLC.
3947088	3949749	I understand the having the Horizon Rally as DLC.
3950109	3954572	But some of this other stuff, it's not that it ruins the game because you don't have to do it.
3955252	3960775	I just think it's a little bit tacky, especially when it's press right trigger to get it.
3962789	3964291	and then pops up the menu.
3964351	3972618	It's just like, quit shoving that shit in my face because it's really tacky to ask me to pay $60 for a game or whatever and then do this stuff on top of it.
3973018	3977382	Now again, I'm just saying, I did enjoy the game overall and I didn't pay $60 for it.
3977422	3977922	I rented it.
3977962	3983127	So maybe in some ways I did get it for free and I deserve to have all this shoved in my face.
3983427	3985989	But if I do decide to take the plunge and spend the $40, $50, $60 to get it,
3987650	3990351	I just wish the game would stop trying to nickel and dime me after that.
3990471	3994311	It's like, as a developer, I really think you need to choose which road are you going to go down?
3994692	3996932	Are you going to charge $60 for a fully featured game?
3997192	4001633	Are you going to charge $0.99 for a half-assed feature game and try to sell me the $50 worth of features?
4001993	4003133	That's my big question about it.
4003793	4005134	So, just saying.
4005594	4007934	That's my one little bitch about the thing.
4008914	4012475	Actdeft in chat says, Rob, it's people from Bazaar and Codemasters.
4013075	4014316	That makes a lot of sense, actually.
4014996	4015456	So there you go.
4016596	4023338	Alright, by the way, Jamie, I did also get in the car shop, the decal shop, somebody made a car made with N7 sticker on it.
4023618	4024459	It looks like the Normandy.
4024819	4025319	It's adorable.
4025959	4026799	Okay, I have to play this now.
4028060	4028720	Thought you might say that.
4029940	4031941	Alright, that's it for my gaming week.
4032321	4033002	I'll leave it at that.
4033522	4037323	I felt like I played a lot of games in my downtime and was able to play some well.
4039505	4044129	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
4044469	4046091	Use the passphrase, group.
4046631	4049294	So now that we're like an hour into the show, maybe we should get into some news.
4049714	4050835	Let me throw out some housekeeping.
4051015	4051676	Fuck the news.
4052056	4054578	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to visit us on Twitter.
4054958	4059602	Also, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to add us on Facebook as well.
4059662	4061484	We are also on Google Plus at...
4062645	4064868	Google Plus, search Orange Lounge Radio.
4064888	4068073	There's also a little mini URL that Tiger Claude made some time back.
4068113	4072419	It's like gplus.to slash Orange Lounge Radio or something like that.
4072439	4072739	I don't know.
4073360	4075643	Anyway, let's get into some actual news.
4076023	4076945	Loki, why don't you start us off?
4077293	4088156	So there was a lot of drama with the game War Z. It was released on Steam and it wasn't very good because it wasn't finished yet.
4088597	4097459	And there was a bunch of stuff that they had in the product description talking about the features of the game and not a lot of that was true.
4098080	4105382	And then it got to the point where it was so bad that Valve actually kicked it off Steam until the publisher...
4105942	4109464	or I should say the developer fixes all the problems and issues with it.
4110884	4128452	So to kind of go along with that, now they're having the actual name of the game being suspended and the trademark is kind of gone because of the movie World War Z which is going to be coming out in 2013 with the zombie typhoon.
4130112	4131173	Really weird trailer for that.
4131693	4152279	but yeah so there of course you know the War Z is a little too close to the World War Z and unfortunately the War Z filed their trademark request a little after World War Z and so because of that it's most likely going to go to you know Paramount so now it's going to be called something else
4155257	4159761	I thought when I heard about that game that I was like, wasn't there that movie as well?
4159901	4162003	There's been a book out for years.
4162143	4165265	I kind of did think there was a link between them.
4165385	4171510	So I have to admit, oops, I might not be helping the game's case here, but I kind of did think they were related at first.
4171871	4174713	Before I read up a little more on the game, I finally did figure it out.
4174833	4178236	Yeah, and unfortunately the game in me looks kind of like a ripoff of The Daisy.
4179618	4189247	If I remember correctly, I think this is actually, it's another game that has a similar title, like War Something, and it's kind of like a zombie mode of that, or a zombie mod of that.
4189887	4190047	But...
4191348	4192409	Yeah, it kind of sucks.
4192509	4195332	Another MMO trying to compete in that same franchise.
4195352	4200396	Is this the same game that has all that fuckery behind it where the Steam thing was misleading and all that?
4200416	4201637	Yes, yes, that was it.
4202278	4210125	Where the guy called his own fans that were abusing the game or whatever a dirty word and all this stuff.
4210605	4214008	You know, claiming there's multiple maps, there's only one.
4214068	4218432	Claiming that the maps are like 1,500 kilometers or whatever and it's not even close.
4218732	4240355	I'm gonna holla back to a 2011 reference but it's like if that ocean marketing guy were running a game company like that's just what I have pictured in my mind of like this when I read about this guy and his antics with the game as I'm like oh my god it's like that ocean marketing crap all over yeah it's just it's not not boating well and unfortunately I don't think the game will be able to recover from it because by the time that
4241656	4243818	All this stuff is fixed and the final version of the game is done.
4244618	4249142	You probably have the standalone DayZ client, so no one really cares.
4250343	4259750	Some people cared because they bought the game, but unfortunately it's pretty terrible because they never said, oh hey, this is like an alpha that we're releasing as a paid game.
4261051	4262192	It's really weird.
4262212	4263193	I don't know.
4264853	4265233	PlayStation 2
4291078	4291518	No more.
4291938	4292438	It's done.
4292759	4293559	At least in Japan.
4293599	4297120	The PlayStation 2 has ceased shipping to Japanese retailers.
4297900	4302122	Once the current stock of PlayStation 2 is off the Japanese shelves, it is gone.
4303442	4304402	It's the PlayStation 2.
4305283	4308164	The console is literally about 13 years old.
4308864	4311925	It's probably one of the longest lasting consoles out of any of them.
4312385	4313165	It's had a good life.
4313605	4315246	But there's a lot of people this week that are like,
4316849	4317850	No more PS2.
4318710	4320431	But, I mean, come on, guys.
4320451	4322112	There's plenty of them out there.
4322152	4322893	Dreamcast.
4323153	4327876	I think the only reason this is actually sad is because not all the PlayStation 3s are backwards compatible.
4328256	4331698	So what if my PlayStation 2 breaks and I need to get a new PlayStation 2?
4331738	4332539	Thrift store.
4333099	4334440	I guess that's what you're going to have to do, right?
4334580	4334940	I don't know.
4335120	4335400	eBay.
4336001	4337522	And they don't say anything about the U.S.
4337802	4340504	either, but I don't think these are exactly easy to find in the U.S.
4340564	4340964	as it is.
4341124	4342945	Wings of a Goddess I don't know if that came out over here
4370996	4372517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4396385	4399026	Because I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.
4399086	4403867	I was actually surprised they were still making PS2 games for a while after the PS3 came out.
4404227	4405948	I mean, yeah, I expected maybe a year.
4406688	4408189	But how long has the PS3 been out now?
4408229	4408809	What, two years?
4408949	4409349	Three years?
4409469	4410049	Something like that?
4410869	4412290	It's been more than that.
4412330	4412850	More than that, yeah.
4412870	4413850	Five years now, I think.
4414351	4415811	I'm so completely not surprised.
4415871	4419612	It's time for... I bet they're prepping for a next-gen system.
4419632	4420612	Of course.
4420632	4425254	And phasing out the... It's almost exactly how it happened with the first PlayStation.
4425354	4425674	Well, it...
4426013	4428795	Yeah, it's just there's no game sync coming out in PS2 anymore.
4429055	4430135	It doesn't matter.
4430796	4433097	The people who are gonna have one, have one.
4433377	4433577	Right.
4434378	4436339	I have a first model Japanese PlayStation 2.
4437239	4437940	Works just fine.
4438420	4439961	Don't need a new one.
4440001	4448325	Going to our chatters who are clarifying some of the Final Fantasy XI issues, Shane Alinko says, they already said no more Final Fantasy XI PlayStation 2 expansions in the US.
4448745	4454408	Ragenator says Wings of the Goddess did come out here, but there won't be any more here in the US, which makes sense.
4456277	4456758	Who cares?
4456818	4458538	It's just Final Fantasy XI anyway, goddamn.
4458558	4460119	There's a lot of newer games you could be playing.
4460479	4465842	I don't even know, well, and the other thing too is I don't even know if that, couldn't they do it digitally?
4466142	4476607	I mean, I know they don't really have anything in sort of in place for PlayStation 2, but I mean, if you think about it, you could probably just download, because I know they have those three kind of micro expansions.
4476807	4480949	Those never really came out as a disc version, but they could do something like that.
4481309	4482650	Yeah, you can download it to the hard drive.
4482690	4483010	I don't know.
4483150	4485731	Damn, there's so many job classes I was not aware of.
4485812	4488693	I was like, well, dude, what's all this?
4488773	4489954	This is a scholar.
4490074	4490474	I don't know.
4490494	4492475	I'm a smart guy.
4492495	4495177	That's really going to fight off a goblin.
4495197	4496777	They're black mages and white mages.
4496797	4507303	They're like gray mages, but their thing is that they're a great sub job because you can do the... I forget what the skills call, but it's basically you enhance your black magic and weaken your white magic or vice versa.
4507523	4509284	They're like a yin-yang mage type of thing.
4509844	4510065	Yeah.
4511005	4511245	Cool.
4511466	4512046	And now you know.
4512707	4513328	And now I know.
4513428	4518594	And dancers are great for soloing.
4519195	4526344	Let's get to level 20 first because shit, I gotta go do all that stuff solo now because I'm not gonna be able to... I think I'm gonna go back to play Ragnarok online now.
4526504	4528006	Because retro's fun?
4528567	4532392	Hey, that's why I picked the Ragnarok server, so it'd be easy for me to remember which one it was.
4532412	4534234	It's like, yeah, Ragnarok, okay, cool.
4534555	4541223	Yeah, because Bismarck's gone, so I don't even know where the hell my character would be anyways, even if I redid my old barred Black Mage.
4541243	4542164	They merged a bunch of servers.
4543947	4545809	Flaco, you have fond memories of the PlayStation 2?
4546710	4561814	Yeah, and actually, my wife and I were thinking about buying a Slim a couple years ago, so we went to Fry's, and I had one, but, I mean, I have one, but it's kind of flaky, it doesn't have a great video connection, it doesn't play, sometimes it cuts out in the middle of playing a game, so it's dying.
4562574	4569316	And she wanted to play Kingdom Hearts 2, and so I was like, well, we're at Fry's, let's just see, what is it, like 20 bucks?
4569676	4572297	It's still $100, two years ago at least.
4572637	4572997	Oh, wow.
4573257	4575658	I'm not paying $100 for a PlayStation 2.
4575758	4577599	Or someone at the thrift store for $50.
4578320	4583683	It's honestly because these older devices, they don't price protect them, so they're not going to drop the price because they're losing money.
4583903	4589426	Because when they bought them, there was no margin in it anyway, so they're not going to eat $50 on a console.
4589546	4592628	They're just going to let it sit there until someone's dumb enough to buy it for that.
4592908	4594149	I mean, that's why you've got to go secondhand.
4594440	4595821	Yeah, I mean, I had a used one.
4595861	4596641	That was my whole point.
4597681	4599462	So we just hooked up the old one, and it worked.
4599522	4602364	My wife beat Kingdom Hearts 2 again, and all was good.
4602944	4607046	Well, I'm looking at Amazon, and they're a little scarce to find.
4607086	4610927	I mean, they're all from the second-hand sellers, and $149 new or $130 new, but $50 used, or $43.99 used.
4610967	4612128	Yeah, well, mine held up, so that was good.
4612148	4613108	But yeah, I had no idea it would be $100.
4613148	4613669	I was thinking maybe...
4623453	4623833	DarkSakura
4651331	4654794	Well, as I was saying earlier, there are Steam sales.
4654955	4655675	Yay!
4656696	4658518	And I mean, there's a crapload of sales.
4659959	4663102	There's daily sales, flash sales, prolonged discounts.
4663583	4665885	You can basically see a game go on sale every 12 hours.
4667817	4696450	I'm not really joking at all they're doing like bundle sales like 75% off whole game series and stuff and you can get Steam alerts and now it's like in fact I just had the Steam site open just a moment ago but they had hold on say something Rob I wanted to check in with everybody on their Steam casualties what have you given into on this sale so far I picked up Limbo
4697871	4723008	and Closure and I picked up what the crap game was that oh Assassin's Creed 2 like I was saying Skyrim isn't on a good enough sale yet for me to justify it the Bioshock franchise is on sale for 10 bucks check Skyrim again it was the daily today or yesterday and that's as low as it's gonna get the Bioshock franchise yeah I'm not gonna pay 30 bucks Bioshock franchise go Amazon it's five bucks there hmm
4724033	4724894	I'd still play it through.
4724954	4727575	Yeah, I hear Far Cry 3 you can get a better deal on some other websites too.
4727595	4729356	Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition is $2.49.
4729676	4734258	And seriously, if you haven't played that by now, then what rock have you been under?
4735019	4736279	Mass Effect 2 right now is $5.
4738781	4742022	I bought Gianna Sister's Twisted Dreams because I wanted it anyway.
4742062	4742883	The Valve Collection is $50.
4744404	4746245	That surprisingly is the only game I bought.
4746425	4748046	Except, I will say, Alan...
4748846	4754809	Trying to get the achievement for getting the gift meta thing or doing all the little meta achievements for the holiday sale.
4755069	4758351	He gave me a gift of a little $1.50.
4758431	4760152	I didn't know they had achievements for a sale.
4760592	4760833	They do.
4761653	4762694	Anything to get you to buy.
4763714	4765635	This is another game I'm actually kind of interested in.
4765695	4767196	It's another $2.50 game.
4767556	4769137	It's called The Tiny Bang Story.
4769737	4770518	One of the indie games.
4772319	4775542	It's got some neat puzzle elements in it too.
4777844	4783188	But back on the Critical Mass Postal Beat Hazard.
4785049	4790834	Let's see, I'm just trying to get... The entire Indie Super Mega Pack 30 games is $70.
4791635	4791955	Not bad.
4791995	4794937	Which for all of that, yeah.
4795098	4799061	I will probably inevitably get Dark Souls again when it goes on Super Sale.
4799778	4801098	The Far Cry franchise is $50.
4801819	4802219	Not bad.
4802339	4803059	Mark of the Ninja, $8.
4804479	4805939	The Witcher 2, $8.
4806940	4808720	Flacco, have you given in to any of the sales yet?
4810080	4812541	I have not, but I already have a lot of those games.
4812601	4814622	I have Limbo, and I love Bioshock.
4814662	4818803	I have those, and I got the Humble Bundle thing.
4818883	4826724	So I was like, I don't need more games that I'm not going to play because I still need to hook a computer up to my TV in the front room because I haven't had that since I moved.
4826985	4827645	Hey, and Civ V, $8. $8.
4829662	4830963	Get that, because Civ 5 is great.
4831423	4834105	I don't really like the Civ games, but other people can play them.
4835046	4835987	You know this about me.
4836867	4839789	Here's something if you want to get Civ 5 and some other games.
4840130	4841211	They have on Amazon.
4841231	4847195	See, because I've been doing Amazon because everything's Steam codes, and you can just redeem it over on Steam, and they're a little bit cheaper.
4848196	4849296	Shop around for the best bargain.
4849416	4867648	The 2K Mega Pack, which is I think seven or nine games, includes Bioshock 2, Bioshock, Borderlands Game of the Year Edition, Civ City, Rome, Duke Nukem Forever Complete Pack, Mafia 2, Civ 5, Game of the Year Edition, Civ 4, the Complete Edition, and the Stronghold Collection for $30.
4868857	4871582	I don't think I would even accept money to take Duke Nukem forever.
4872764	4877032	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Loki, check your profile and see the badges.
4877353	4881060	That's for the holiday sale meta achievements and all that crap is.
4882336	4882876	or don't.
4883036	4886098	Don't get suckered into that stuff.
4886918	4895541	I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the little mini games this year where it's like the little achievements within the games that were tied to the holiday.
4895721	4898422	They haven't done things like that since last year and I like that stuff.
4898442	4903084	Remember last year they had the whole get the pieces of coal and then you could trade up the coal and get the games.
4903484	4907346	That was so much better but I guess beggars can't be choosers.
4907446	4909247	It's awesome they're doing what they are as it is.
4910928	4911628	Disney Infinity
4925484	4927406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4955947	4959631	Um, yeah, it's very interesting.
4959651	4961292	I wish we had more information about it.
4961852	4969939	As if, like, you know, we had some sort of document or something that, oh, what the hell is this that's in my lap here from, like, weeks ago that's under a pile of cords and stuff?
4970299	4972161	It's a document about Disney Infinity.
4972221	4973402	That's so weird.
4974263	4975223	So weird.
4977705	4978466	Let's see here.
4978486	4979367	Mm-hmm.
4980655	4984757	Introducing a new game platform that takes you to infinite game possibilities and beyond.
4984797	4994320	Imagine bringing together your favorite Disney and Disney Pixar heroes' stories and locations as toys to create your own unique customized environments, adventures, and stories just the way you want them.
4994721	4996161	Now you can with Disney Infinity.
4996261	4997882	The possibilities are infinite.
4999195	5005858	But it sounds like the game itself may not be like, you know, we know it's inspired by Skylanders, the whole like real life figures and this whole thing.
5006118	5011200	But it's not that the game itself may not necessarily be Skylanders because Skylanders is apparently very Diablo.
5011460	5020484	Yeah, I think it is going to be kind of more like the toy box mode because they're talking about, OK, so some of the stuff that they're going to be tying in with is mainly going to be a lot of movie tie ins and stuff.
5020524	5023646	So, for example, since this game is supposed to be coming out around June.
5024807	5032096	You're going to have Monsters University, Pixar's Cars, The Lone Ranger, Incredibles,
5039845	5048068	Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gadgets, Buildings, Vehicles, Environments, etc.
5051610	5056832	Basically, the way they have it work is each character has a character, coins, and a playset pieces.
5057312	5060233	They get put down on this reader.
5060293	5063054	When you put them on the reader, it unlocks game content.
5063519	5064901	But they are actual figures.
5065081	5066742	They're actual figures.
5066762	5073149	The actual reader is actually kind of the same shape as the Infinity logo or the N that they have in the Infinity logo.
5073189	5075872	It's like this weird like hexagon.
5076413	5080156	It's this weird like uneven hexagon thing that they've got there.
5080176	5081258	At least that's in the little...
5084063	5100037	and yeah it's uh apparently yeah it says open world innovative game design AAA quality game uh complete line of interactive game pieces supporting all platforms supports all TWDC events um
5102799	5105641	So yeah, looks like it'll be interesting.
5105761	5108523	I mean, more interesting than Skylanders, that's for sure.
5109223	5109503	Whatever.
5109664	5111725	Because it's Disney and all the Disney works.
5111985	5114667	You know people are going to fucking eat this shit up.
5114727	5115487	And it's because...
5116943	5118966	I mean, look at just the crap that people collect.
5119006	5120468	I'm a little worried about Flacco.
5120508	5125615	Not only is he a Disney addict like the rest of us, but he has kids, and he can justify, oh, it's for the kids.
5125935	5126496	I know.
5126676	5132124	If my kids want Skylanders, I'll be like, no, but if you want something similar, you can get a Disney video.
5132164	5132965	I'll be fine with that.
5133626	5134447	So, yeah, I mean...
5136799	5137540	It'll be interesting.
5137620	5137940	But yeah.
5138220	5143543	Will you find an excuse to go to Disneyland just because they have a limited edition character that you can only get in the parks?
5143563	5143824	Probably.
5143844	5145465	Because you know that shit's going to happen.
5145545	5146245	I'll go anyway.
5146285	5147306	I don't care.
5147386	5153410	Well, anyways, you'll be hearing it from the rest of the game blogs in January because there's some sort of embargo or some bullshit.
5153430	5154210	But you know what?
5154250	5155771	No fucking embargoes on this train.
5159523	5160763	No one shares information with us.
5161444	5161864	All right.
5162004	5162444	Fair enough.
5162844	5164125	It's just Disney Infinity.
5164585	5166245	It's not Fort Knox.
5166505	5167746	We all know what's coming.
5168446	5168846	There it is.
5169326	5169586	All right.
5170046	5174608	Anyhow, let's go from Disney to talking about pornography, shall we?
5176048	5176508	Yay.
5176808	5177869	Well, that's an easy segue.
5177909	5181970	I'm suddenly reminded of this gif I saw of the Wicked Queen from Snow White.
5182070	5185331	She's holding this open box and she has this scowl on her face.
5185651	5187652	And the little caption says, who put a dick in this box?
5189048	5190049	That was awesome.
5190069	5190649	Yeah, that's great.
5190909	5192490	Anyway, let's talk about porn.
5193310	5197832	Porn found on a 3DS and was traded into GameStop.
5199333	5199793	Oh, boy.
5199913	5200154	Yes.
5200714	5201074	Let's see.
5201174	5204756	This is actually a report from the Daily Mail that got this.
5204876	5213600	I guess a refurbished Nintendo 3DS had nine pornographic images on it and was yet traded into GameStop.
5213860	5214741	Oh, wait.
5215261	5216782	Does this link to a local news story?
5217302	5221485	I gotta do this because it looks like it's Channel 9 News here in the States.
5221585	5222506	Oh, I gotta find this.
5223486	5223927	Yes!
5225147	5227489	We get to hear sensationalist local news.
5227609	5229630	I love sensationalist local news.
5229670	5233173	Let's hear sensationalist local news tell the story.
5233993	5237916	Who can take a small problem and just blow it way out of proportion?
5238536	5239097	Local news.
5239157	5242419	We need a bumper for local news that just distorts everything.
5242479	5242999	Alright, here we go.
5243079	5245581	Local news on Porn in 3S.
5247242	5248586	I don't want to hear... Zip ties!
5249509	5250652	I love zip ties!
5250692	5251594	Sell me more!
5251695	5253259	You're blowing zip ties out of a Porsche.
5254284	5257046	Dude, do they have like a shop that's dedicated to zip ties?
5257086	5258526	Because that's fucking awesome.
5259047	5259687	I want to know more now.
5259707	5260507	It's your zip ties.
5260527	5261468	Your long zip ties.
5261488	5262408	Your small zip ties.
5262549	5263529	Your colored zip ties.
5263549	5263989	You know what?
5264009	5264530	What the hell?
5264610	5266091	It's apparently... Spatula City.
5266311	5272014	It's a store called A to Z. And it has everything from... They sell spatulas.
5272054	5273254	Who needs that place to zip ties?
5273715	5277377	People who like work with a lot of cords and people who want to murder people?
5277537	5278017	I don't know.
5278077	5279158	All right, local news time.
5279218	5279458	Shut up.
5281229	5285430	New tonight, a father from Lakewood had to return one gift that was given his son.
5285510	5287471	He says it traumatized his family.
5288051	5293733	The five-year-old boy found pornographic pictures on the refurbished game device he got for Christmas.
5293753	5298374	9 News reporter Megan Fitzgerald joins us from the GameStop where the item was purchased.
5298394	5300375	Megan, the company says it's trying to make it right.
5301275	5305997	Adele, that's what they're saying, but the dad just doesn't... Wait, the reporter, the lady's name is Adele?
5307819	5310582	Did I hear that correctly?
5310642	5312023	Is the news lady's name Adele?
5313765	5315227	You know people are named Adele, by the way.
5316109	5319672	Let's go outside the GameStop and watch the sky fall.
5319932	5323935	See how that's possible since you can't just erase these images from his son's brain.
5324395	5332441	But the store behind me gave the family a brand new upgraded Nintendo 3DS.
5332461	5334062	They also threw in some games in there.
5334102	5337424	But the dad says there's really no way to make this right.
5337484	5340767	He just wants to let other families know so it doesn't happen to their kids.
5344154	5349540	That's the name of the electric buzzsaw, by the way, trying to get into the kid's brain.
5349580	5352784	No kidding, it's a toy tank.
5353144	5355126	It's really exhilarating.
5355387	5358170	Or it is really exhilarating.
5358270	5364396	Especially when you're five, and especially when you've been waiting all year round for that special toy.
5365237	5366617	I got a 3DS.
5366738	5368598	Yeah, you got a 3DS, that's right.
5368918	5371179	And these are the pictures that we took this morning.
5371299	5371919	There's Brayden.
5372139	5375120	But Wednesday morning, that excitement turned to horror.
5375520	5382402	He handed a 3DS to Brighton, and Brighton said, Dad, I don't think he should be looking at these pictures.
5382442	5383062	Wait, stop.
5383663	5384923	I don't think we should be looking at these pictures.
5385197	5386379	It's just a DS.
5387180	5388481	It's not a 3DS.
5388541	5390123	It's just exactly like a DS.
5390143	5390964	You are 5.
5391024	5396351	You shouldn't be looking at those pictures because don't you read the warning that you're not supposed to play it when you're under 7 or you're going to go cross-eyed?
5396371	5396771	That's true.
5397212	5397752	Did you hear about that?
5397772	5401817	And I said, Dad, this DS has porn on it.
5402578	5405839	and I handed him the DS and he just got up and walked out.
5405879	5407160	Are they all crying?
5407500	5408541	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
5408561	5410501	First world problems, first world problems.
5410521	5411762	Dad is wiping away tears.
5411882	5412342	Hold on.
5412422	5413523	And the kid is crying.
5413543	5414903	How does a kid know what porn is?
5415443	5417164	How does a five-year-old know what porn is?
5417204	5419725	That's the first thing he said was, this has porn on it?
5419745	5420726	Julian doesn't know what porn is.
5420746	5424687	Because I would think that a five-year-old isn't probably going to know what that stuff is.
5424707	5425908	Oh, those people are being silly.
5425928	5427648	I'm going to ask an expert, a.k.a.
5427728	5428129	a mom.
5428809	5430670	Does your son know what porn is?
5433232	5442303	This whole thing really... Allegedly, in my opinion, this thing seems like it's being set up for a lawsuit.
5443564	5444666	Look good on camera, guys.
5444686	5445627	Make sure you're crying.
5446047	5448050	And they told the kid what to say.
5448130	5449872	There's porn on the DS, daddy.
5451892	5452592	I'm asking Becky.
5453533	5456275	Even Fifth Dream in chat, why does a five-year-old know what porn means?
5456615	5457335	To the phone.
5457876	5458756	Oh, I lost it.
5459236	5461838	I just called everybody.
5465060	5465400	Really?
5466361	5471304	It was hard for Mark Giles' two young sons to see pornographic images on their toy.
5472031	5479255	Now look, I get if somebody is like super religious or whatever and is offended by the side of porn and so forth.
5480095	5489240	And the fact that like a kid saw it because, you know, as much as we're laughing to have a good time with it, it is fucked up that a kid, you know, that didn't want to be subjected to it got subjected to it.
5489280	5490541	But I'm sorry.
5490741	5492122	This is way over the top for me.
5492282	5492802	But you know what?
5492822	5493563	This is not angry.
5493583	5494643	You know what's even worse about it?
5494663	5497745	I hate the spoiled part of the story here that we're probably going to get to here.
5498325	5499706	I think he said it was from Santa Claus.
5501167	5501347	Hmm.
5505092	5506453	That was a gift from Santa Claus.
5508053	5508813	There was another one.
5508833	5510794	I can't be mature about it.
5510874	5512735	I can't be mature about that.
5513055	5522078	There was another one that I saw, too, that wasn't necessarily this, but it was one of those where you buy stuff from Walmart as a returned item, and in the box, instead of a 3DS, it was rocks.
5523240	5523741	That's great.
5524481	5529026	Okay, so I asked Becky, for the sake of the show, does Julian know what porn is?
5529486	5531128	And I did, at the end.
5532189	5533350	And she says, no!
5533590	5537634	In big, bold letters, with four exclamation points, and then LOL.
5538595	5540958	But it was even harder for him.
5541719	5545502	And then I said, you know, what was going on, and she said, weird!
5546683	5549826	So that's coming from a mom with a five-year-old, just saying.
5550287	5556032	All right, let me let the sensationalist local news, courtesy of Nine News, finish up here.
5556833	5559536	Who tried so hard to make Christmas special.
5559976	5569766	About nine images of sexual activity on his toy that he got from Santa, that Santa got from GameStop.
5570270	5571971	So GameStop tried to make it right.
5572172	5578417	They told Giles the images were from a previous owner and they weren't caught before the refurbished device was sold.
5579017	5580018	But you can't unsee this.
5580058	5581019	He's five years old.
5581680	5584903	Now maybe when he's 18 or 20, maybe he won't know anything about it.
5584963	5586524	The kids are hugging right now.
5586684	5588385	They're showing a picture of the kids hugging.
5588405	5589747	The little boy has no freaking clue what's going on.
5589767	5593270	They're comforting each other about this horrific imagery.
5594010	5595712	He's not going to forget about it tomorrow.
5597321	5601262	And the company wouldn't go on camera, but the corporate office sent us the following statement.
5601322	5605482	It says, GameStop is currently researching the situation.
5605802	5613324	We have a rigorous quality control process in place to ensure that existing content is removed from all devices before they are resold.
5613724	5618125	Out of millions of transactions each year, ones like this happen very rarely.
5618545	5622005	Our number one priority is to make this right for our customers.
5622185	5625786	Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says, ROFL, Santa shops at the Evil G.
5628385	5636928	and an employee at the GameStop behind us told Giles that they're going to do their own investigation to try and find out how this happened, Adele, so that they can make sure it doesn't happen again.
5636948	5637148	Really?
5637348	5637588	Really?
5637608	5640809	I'm kind of curious, Megan, is this type of a bulk eraser?
5640829	5644310	It would seem like that you would erase everything on every unit.
5645450	5646470	You would think so, Adele.
5646511	5654673	In fact, the father was saying that there's a SIM card that easily could have just been removed that would have erased all of these images, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
5655157	5658198	Of course, we weren't going to show those images because they were very graphic.
5658318	5664560	But again, the company is saying that they try and catch things like this, but this one obviously slipped through the cracks.
5664820	5665380	Obviously.
5665560	5665880	All right.
5665940	5666600	Megan Fitzgerald.
5666620	5667001	Thanks, Megan.
5667021	5668601	Slipped through the cracks.
5668641	5668901	Really?
5669061	5669261	Really?
5669301	5673463	They're going to launch an investigation to like, oh, some dickhead forgot to erase this.
5673483	5677824	Yeah, but the thing is with the way that GameStop functions, probably half that store is fired.
5679084	5679585	No, seriously.
5679605	5680585	No, you're right, probably.
5680706	5684908	Because they make up shit to fire their employees over.
5684988	5686289	I'm not lying.
5686830	5692053	I don't think that the store would get fired because any system that they take back for refurbishment gets sent away.
5692093	5694335	No, this is GameStop.
5694355	5696336	There's a reason why they're called Evil G, Loki.
5696756	5699458	They fire people for the tiniest of little reasons.
5699598	5700959	I know people personally.
5702080	5703241	Why do you think my husband quit?
5704258	5710702	Actdeft in our chatroom says, they could have had the porn, but they're rolling in the deep.
5710842	5711422	All right, forget it.
5711822	5714244	Look, it is a crappy situation.
5714424	5717566	I think that is way over the top, the way everybody's reacting.
5717626	5721068	It's like, okay, you know, it's obvious what happened.
5721488	5722228	It is wrong.
5722388	5726171	GameStop should say, hey, whoops, we didn't erase this one, you know.
5726531	5728272	But at the same time, I kind of wonder, like,
5729460	5736924	How did... Did the parents not think to look first before handing the system to their five-year-old?
5736964	5740146	I mean, he says, I went to go take the picture and I handed it to the five-year-old.
5740406	5744609	How did... I'm trying to think, like, in having used the DS, how did he not see the pictures first then?
5744629	5745969	That's what I don't get.
5746029	5747030	You're the parent in the room.
5748497	5751440	My kid would not know what porn is when he's five.
5751601	5754023	And I don't think you even know what he was looking at.
5754063	5755044	Daddy, what's that?
5755104	5755765	Why are they naked?
5755785	5756226	Yeah, exactly.
5756286	5757046	I think that's what happened.
5757147	5758288	That's what I think might have happened.
5758348	5761091	And then he decided, oh, I'm going to get a case going.
5761111	5763613	So this is what you say to the reporter's kids.
5764074	5766016	Because I feel like the kid's not going to know what he saw.
5766076	5766737	In your opinion.
5766777	5767277	In my opinion.
5767297	5767618	In my opinion.
5768799	5769739	This is what I think.
5770079	5775743	I honestly think that it's parents thinking other people are doing their due diligence for them, honestly.
5776643	5778664	They say, oh, it's coming in.
5778824	5781266	We believe that, you know, we're not going to check.
5781286	5782406	We wouldn't think about this.
5783007	5788390	You know, if it was something that they were truly worried about, then they would have gone through it to begin with.
5788630	5795252	Let's be honest, as a 3DS cameraman, he's lucky to even know what's going on there because that camera is such a piece of shit.
5795812	5797953	He'll be like, what is that?
5798173	5799693	I don't even know what's going on.
5800653	5802934	Those two blobs are really close to each other.
5803034	5804314	I mean, it's just, who knows?
5804654	5810336	I just remember hearing from my little brothers, Mommy and Daddy are wrestling again.
5813442	5820305	Or even better, if they did shoot it very well, it's like, oh my god, my eyes are literally being raped by the penis coming out at me.
5820345	5822366	Dick in 3D.
5822426	5827048	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, GameStop needs to double check their stuff.
5827468	5835171	I don't think any of us are doubting that, but you know, and I'm not exactly giving them a break, but it's like, I see how this happened.
5835471	5838653	Christmas rush, someone got lazy, it slipped through.
5838973	5841234	Doesn't make it right, but that's what happened, clearly.
5841434	5846015	or sometimes if you use a mass formatter for a card.
5846556	5851077	I've seen it happen where even for camera and phone sims, they won't do.
5852677	5855818	What about the guy that returned that in the first place?
5856098	5861220	Honestly, if it was me returning something, I wouldn't be like, hey, I'm going to put all my porn on there and leave it on there.
5861320	5866902	It's just like when I sold my 3DS on eBay, I erased all the porn that I had on there.
5867902	5874827	Not anything that I actually photographed, but you can download stuff that actually goes on your card that has picture sets and stuff like that.
5874887	5879731	People shot with professional 3D cameras that aren't shit like the 3DS cameras.
5879851	5882473	I think this is a good point that ShadowNextGen says in our chat room.
5882853	5885375	Walmart does a worse job than GameStop.
5888581	5892506	Actdeft closing up the story saying that kid should feel privileged he had 3D porn
5905550	5907431	I do all the time.
5907852	5909132	He's observing the future.
5909492	5912474	Speaking of Nintendo porn, a good segue for me to mention this.
5912714	5915696	A porn app coming to the Wii U, SugarDVD.
5916116	5921239	They offer unlimited adult TV streaming on the PlayStation 3, iPad, Xbox 360, and so forth.
5921539	5928523	They've announced that they're bringing their app to the Wii U. Unlimited streaming porn straight to the game console, $7.95 a month.
5928563	5930485	And you're probably thinking, wait a minute, how do they do this?
5930605	5933006	I don't know this porn app on the PS3 and so forth.
5933624	5935786	It's launched through the web browser.
5937507	5939609	So in other words, that's not much of an app.
5939809	5944113	It's a website that you pay for to just get it formatted.
5944153	5945074	It's like OLRPSP.com.
5945094	5946415	But it's cool to call things an app.
5946795	5951359	To be fair, it's probably looking at the user agent and stuff like that and formatting to their site.
5951379	5953881	Because I actually have the SugarDVD app on.
5954542	5955442	Of course you do.
5955503	5956163	No, no, no, no.
5956183	5956523	Hold on.
5956563	5956864	Hold on.
5957404	5972241	Let me be clear, let me be clear, I don't pay for porn, okay, so, okay, so, I had the app on, it came, you know, it's part of the repository for the boxy, and so they have it, you know, and of course I downloaded all the porn apps and seen, you know, I was like, ah, got
5972341	5974203	Pay for this, fuck that, delete.
5974623	5976565	But, you know, they had it.
5976645	5984391	And so, yeah, a lot of this thing with the boxy, the way the boxy works is it's just, you know, websites formatted for those devices.
5984932	5987094	So, yeah, I mean, I could see that they would do that.
5987854	5991057	And, of course, Nintendo would be like, oh, we don't officially do this.
5991417	5995781	By the way, the Internet Explorer browser on the 360 sucks for viewing porn.
5996502	5996942	Just saying.
5998559	6000680	We have to work on New Year's Eve?
6000700	6001101	That sucks.
6019011	6020473	Yeah, but my boss won't be there.
6020713	6021213	Oh, that's money.
6021614	6022074	Yeah, money.
6022174	6022875	That's the thing.
6022955	6023135	Money.
6024096	6029122	So anyway, we've been talking and talking about this and I knew it was going to happen and I'm so happy.
6029322	6031084	Steam for Linux Beta is out.
6031404	6031824	Yes.
6032605	6034988	And I happen to be running Linux.
6035508	6036629	I'm going to test it out.
6037570	6044592	Um, basically all you have to do is, um, if you don't already have a Steam account, you can install and register and you're in.
6045233	6046293	So anyone can be there.
6046313	6048534	There's 39 games on there right now.
6049394	6053655	Um, Killing Floor, um, The Book of Unwritten Tales, and Amnesia are there.
6055516	6062739	And I'm actually trying to see if I can get into the site there to see what else is on.
6063400	6066441	But I mean, still, you know, it's a start.
6066541	6067902	I think that's actually really cool.
6068942	6070583	And I like Linux.
6071623	6076025	I may not have to keep using a PC anymore.
6078046	6080067	So yeah, if you're interested in it, just play.
6080563	6082785	And you know what's great is that Steam big picture thing.
6082825	6084366	It really does kind of just make it look like an Xbox.
6084386	6085166	You know what else is great?
6085907	6086347	3D dick.
6089389	6093112	How could you talk about that, DarkSakura?
6093132	6094533	I'm traumatized.
6094593	6095053	Rob.
6095353	6096134	I'm gonna sue you.
6096234	6096734	Boobs!
6100484	6101885	I could say the C-bomb.
6103086	6107249	Did you notice also when he said when they found out, I called everybody I could think of.
6107949	6114554	Yeah, the news, your lawyer, GameStop.
6115494	6119277	But I did make sure to transfer the pictures before we gave it back.
6119637	6119937	Stop.
6120037	6120357	All right.
6121658	6126161	Let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a GameStop near you.
6130586	6131347	Boobies 3D.
6131647	6132568	Not a damn thing.
6133789	6134430	Nothing in the U.S.
6134450	6134750	this week?
6134950	6135651	Nothing in the U.S.
6136592	6138914	Nothing for people to spend their gift certificates on, huh?
6138975	6141137	Steam sale.
6141177	6142258	Steam!
6142298	6143479	The savior of gamers.
6143499	6144620	That's all you get this week.
6144680	6145221	Nothing new.
6145241	6147843	It's just all Steam stuff until the 8th.
6150554	6152516	Going to Japan and checking out the releases there.
6153016	6155018	Xbox 360, nothing.
6155658	6157880	PlayStation 3, nothing.
6158561	6160022	PlayStation Vita, nothing.
6160042	6163465	The games don't start really coming in again until January 17th, it looks like, actually.
6164506	6166667	Looking at the Wii U, nothing.
6167008	6169189	God, it doesn't look like there's hardly anything coming out on Wii U ever.
6169209	6170150	Yeah, exactly.
6171891	6175973	Yeah, it looks like it is totally dry in Japan as well, so enjoy the games you have right now.
6177073	6181935	I do notice, though, there is on PlayStation 2, Neopets, The Darkest Fairy.
6181955	6184176	Oh, that's a Europe game.
6184856	6187317	It's a Europe game that snuck my way into the Japanese releases.
6188158	6189958	All right, how about Europe, DarkSakura?
6189978	6191039	Nothing until the 11th.
6192139	6193600	But one of them's a Wii U game, Rob.
6193920	6194240	What's that?
6195097	6195658	Ninja Gaiden 3?
6196420	6196720	Okay.
6197101	6197742	Ninja Gaiden 3.
6197982	6199165	Why did I even say it wrong?
6199185	6199686	I don't know.
6200006	6200407	I don't know.
6200447	6201469	I was thinking of porn.
6204014	6204675	3D Cop.
6204918	6210260	We were at Target just a couple days before Christmas and they had like 12 Wii U's there.
6210760	6211820	That's just the one up in Yuba City.
6211840	6213681	They have a tower of them at Fry's.
6213921	6214161	Yeah.
6214641	6215302	They're everywhere.
6215482	6216622	And yeah, they don't ship any to us.
6216802	6219263	It's everywhere.
6219283	6220964	$1,200 on back order with Nintendo.
6221404	6221824	They ship us 12.
6221864	6222144	Fuck them.
6222204	6223084	You know what would have sold them?
6227952	6228593	Tokyo Jungle.
6230714	6231575	I still need to play that.
6232696	6235578	Loki and myself have some stories, and we're going to go to the Classic Game of the Week.
6235718	6235938	Loki?
6235958	6238460	Let's see here.
6239221	6240402	This is kind of interesting.
6241222	6246546	There was that documentary about Minecraft called The Story of Mojang, and it is a two-player production.
6247407	6252251	They decided to go ahead and beat the rush and upload it to the Pirate Bay themselves.
6252671	6255093	So they uploaded it to the Pirate Bay.
6256194	6257375	People can download it for free.
6257395	6264501	They kind of said, hey, listen, we wanted to come here first because we knew the movie would eventually end up here.
6265142	6268304	And the best thing to do seems to be opening a dialogue.
6268344	6272368	Torns and piracy are a way of life and it probably won't be going away anytime soon.
6273188	6274589	You know, I did play Minecraft.
6303396	6304177	Fantastic.
6304397	6306940	You know, ironically enough, I did not play Minecraft this week.
6307081	6307401	Really?
6307902	6321558	Well, actually, I think I went in for a little bit because last week I was fixing the servers because I had screwed up the permissions by not installing the permissions client, so I kept changing the config file and was wondering, why the fuck is nothing changing?
6322384	6324366	Oh, I forgot to reinstall it.
6324947	6325648	That's funny.
6326108	6330994	So I was trying to do that install Flans mod, but Flans mod may not be coming.
6331074	6336940	I really wanted it to happen because that's planes, cars, and guns.
6337321	6341045	So I can shoot one of those scary gray guys with the bow and arrow in the face?
6342510	6344011	Yeah, you could do that now.
6344331	6345711	But I'm talking about actual guns like AK-47s.
6345731	6346972	I'm just hitting it with a pickaxe.
6349853	6356916	My little girl, because I found a skin for her, is making herself a prairie dog town to live in.
6357136	6360717	I'm surprised you didn't find like a shepherd model for your Minecraft character.
6361058	6361658	I'm going to make one.
6361898	6362578	I'm Zongief.
6363759	6366760	Mine's just like some whatever girl one is, but I'm making a shepherd for mine.
6367304	6376329	I did manage to update, well, I have, I'm doing the VOG-Minecraft.com actually has, it has a WordPress thing installed on it.
6376349	6377890	I haven't bothered to update it yet.
6377970	6379471	I haven't, like, started in so many projects.
6379491	6384454	I have another project that may be 2013 that I'm not really going to talk about right now, but hopefully it'll be interesting.
6384514	6389877	But the website is another thing I want to update, so eventually I'll get around to that, but, yeah.
6391164	6394806	Let me go back to the story about leaking your own damn film onto the Pirate Bay.
6394846	6396007	Let me ask our film guy.
6397908	6400169	Obviously, piracy is a bit of a problem in Hollywood, right?
6400389	6401509	Yes.
6401549	6404150	Especially when you talk about other countries, if I'm not mistaken.
6404271	6405631	Yeah, it's much bigger over there.
6405811	6408813	You can go to another country and just get any movie you want, really.
6408953	6411274	You can probably go to the theater and see a movie that was pirated.
6411634	6412014	Probably.
6412034	6414976	What do you think about uploading your own movie to the Pirate Bay?
6416076	6420521	I don't think it's a bad idea for a movie like this because what other exposure are they going to get?
6420661	6424145	Maybe a lot of documentaries sign Netflix deals and I don't know how that works.
6424225	6426327	I don't know how the money transaction works.
6426367	6433995	But if these guys put it up on the Pirate Bay and they put, like Loki said, a message on there saying, hey, please give us money, people might donate to that.
6434155	6434755	The Guilt Thing
6455206	6460047	He uploaded it to the Pirate Bay and basically said, okay, we're going to do this.
6460107	6461628	You pay me what you want for it.
6461748	6468050	I think it's worth $5, but you tell me what you think it's worth and you pay me that or nothing.
6470070	6473932	From what I remember, I think he made actually quite a bit of money from that.
6473992	6475132	It turned out very well.
6475832	6477053	And I think that's kind of the way.
6477093	6481414	It seems like a lot of these pay-what-you-want things like the Humble Bundles and stuff do really well.
6481774	6485255	And they get probably a lot more money than they would have if they tried to sell everything individually.
6486216	6489417	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, It's not guilt.
6489557	6490757	It's supporting something you like.
6491838	6492258	Fair enough.
6492838	6496219	And I haven't watched it yet, but the trailer looked really good for it.
6496239	6497820	I mean, it looked like a pretty awesome documentary.
6498500	6501701	I still need to watch the indie game movie from the Humble Bundle that I have.
6501721	6503162	I wanted to watch that anyway.
6503902	6504062	So...
6505562	6505903	All right.
6505983	6509984	Well, let me get one more story here for you guys, and we'll get to the classic game of the week.
6510384	6514626	But you know the Wii U game Tank, Tank, Tank, which actually is based on an arcade game?
6515926	6519747	Which is funny that you're so excited about it because the game's been getting shit reviews left and right.
6519787	6520708	Like, people do not like it.
6520748	6522208	I don't care about the Wii U one.
6522228	6523869	I care about the arcade one, which is awesome.
6525185	6525645	TankTankTank is now...
6553544	6555084	Free to play, in a way.
6555184	6556505	It's kind of a different type of model.
6556865	6560805	You download the upgradeable demo in the Japanese Nintendo eShop.
6561325	6570947	So what you can do if you're in Japan, you download this demo, you get the basic action game for free, it has multiplayer, you can do the city map, free for all, team battle, giant monster.
6571327	6574988	But if you download the free version, you can only play it three times a day.
6575428	6579529	That restriction is removed if you purchase any download content for the game.
6580089	6585814	If you want to get more parts of this upgradeable demo, you have to get these offered download contents in the game.
6586975	6591800	This is very iPhone, the way this is working out here.
6593061	6598526	All it is, the whole playing it three times daily, that's your little three energy pills.
6599086	6602850	And if you want more energy pills, go buy them on the store or whatever.
6602890	6606012	This is literally the iPhone pricing model.
6607080	6611003	on a launch title for the game now in the Nintendo Wii U shop.
6611023	6611663	Very interesting.
6611683	6618207	I'm a little cautious with Namco doing it because remember Ridge Racer on the Vita and how wonderful that was?
6618868	6621570	Well, you kind of hope that maybe they learned something from that whole experience?
6621670	6626613	I certainly hope so because, God, that was a fucking mess.
6628434	6654726	and Tank Tank Tank's pretty awesome but yeah looking at I can see why the reviews haven't been that good on it because it seemed like the game was very limited as what they what they're offering because I mean in an arcade game it would be it makes sense that okay you get like maybe an hour of entertainment out of it if you're really playing a lot of money into it but you know this is a console game so you gotta have a lot more to it otherwise you're gonna get really bored um so I don't know it's
6655984	6661130	Which reminds me, I need to really go back and play that Sega gun game.
6663573	6664353	What was that called?
6665315	6665835	I don't ever know.
6666536	6667357	Sega gun game?
6667437	6670480	Yeah, there was a Sega gun game that I was really raving about a while back.
6670621	6672863	It's an old... It's not Super World.
6672883	6673804	It's not one of the virtual games.
6673824	6673904	It's...
6676135	6677175	I can't fucking remember now.
6677255	6678756	It's just a really wacky game.
6679676	6683297	Alright, well, maybe somebody in chat will read your mind.
6684117	6688738	But I think this makes a very interesting sort of compliment to the last story you talked about.
6688778	6696319	I mean, they may not be putting Tank Tank Tank up on the Pirate Bay, but essentially they're putting it on a place where they're saying, hey, download it for free and let's see what happens.
6696379	6699400	Because I bet you a lot more people now will play Tank Tank Tank.
6699520	6700261	Ghost Squad Ghost Squad
6717682	6717902	Yeah.
6718062	6718962	Because now it's free.
6719042	6720043	And so everybody's going to be checking out.
6720063	6723624	And there's going to be maybe a handful of people like, oh, yeah, this is kind of fun.
6724124	6725224	And I probably wouldn't have bought this.
6726264	6727384	But you know what?
6727665	6732746	Even though the three times... I understand why they're limiting the gameplay because they're giving you quite a bit of the game.
6733226	6736187	And that seems kind of lame even though it is a demo and stuff.
6736587	6738027	But I understand why they're doing that.
6738067	6744949	But at the same time, it's kind of cool that they're offering that so a lot more people can actually check out the game.
6744969	6745249	Yeah.
6745949	6753219	Fifth Dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says these days wait three months to buy a game and you can spend the same amount to get the add-ons.
6753519	6756503	They're like $60 worth of costumes in DOA 5.
6757024	6757464	Worth.
6757785	6759046	That's how much they cost.
6759267	6760829	So not worth that.
6761269	6764131	I did that for Puzzle Bobble on iPhone.
6765352	6765792	Just saying.
6766332	6770895	And also the three times a day is way better than when they limit it to like 30 plays done.
6771075	6772116	You know, that type of thing.
6772356	6773257	Rayman Legends.
6773497	6775638	Heaven forbid if they did that to the Ni No Kuni demo.
6775678	6777600	I mean, Flacco would have worn it out by now.
6778060	6779441	I think I already have worn it out.
6781900	6782581	Alright, so there you go.
6782621	6783361	Tank, tank, tank.
6783561	6784883	Going free to play in Japan.
6784943	6785303	Who knows?
6785343	6786003	Keep an eye on the news.
6786284	6787124	That could happen here.
6787445	6789066	Especially if they have success with it in Japan.
6789086	6789426	We'll see.
6790187	6792369	Alright, let's travel back to a time when, you know what?
6792389	6794170	There was no free to play.
6794711	6798874	You paid the 50, 60 bucks for this game and either you liked it or F you.
6799374	6800936	It's the classic game of the week.
6801456	6802377	Yay, I'm in chat.
6803755	6805376	Oh, did the G-line get lifted?
6805516	6805636	Yeah.
6805656	6806476	Oh yeah, it's been an hour.
6807076	6809017	We should be able to safely reconnect to chat.
6809037	6809597	There you go.
6809637	6810477	Hooray.
6810917	6811217	Alright.
6811257	6812158	Someone tell Alan.
6812918	6814158	No, we can't all five do it.
6814318	6815399	No, I mean tell Matt to.
6815579	6816499	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6816519	6817039	So.
6817079	6818399	Should I not get that going?
6818780	6820020	That's alright, I'll just be on my phone.
6820040	6821360	My phone's fine.
6821580	6826602	The classic name of the week is Gyruss.
6827982	6828903	Gyruss.
6830503	6831944	You mean, I have a YouTube of it.
6832024	6833304	I know, but I always have to
6835754	6836715	It's so freaking cool.
6836735	6839617	Let's have to listen to a little bit of it.
6839657	6840498	It's freaking awesome.
6840538	6840958	I love this game.
6840978	6843800	How many video games do you know play Takata and you can beat Minor Robin?
6843860	6844000	One.
6844060	6844261	Exactly!
6859981	6870912	So, Gyruss is a shoot-em-up game that if you've played Tempest, you may find the gameplay style very familiar because you go in a circle.
6872791	6878578	It was the last game that Yoshiki Okamoto did for Konami, the first one being Time Pilot.
6879378	6889009	And he was fired after the game was released, and he went to join Capcom, where he gave us, oh, just a couple of little obscure titles like 1942 and Street Fighter.
6892151	6901554	So this one, basically, you're moving around in a circle, hence, I guess, gyrus, and shooting things as they come from the background to the foreground.
6901914	6908877	Like I said, I'm again comparing it to Tempest, because I think that Tempest was definitely inspired by that.
6910597	6927212	So, um, and also like I said, that it actually does play an arrangement of Takata and Fugue in D minor, which I'm sure the Vanessa May fans in chat recognize that one from her version of it, if not, you know, actually paying attention to classical music, you know?
6928033	6941375	So, um, it was, uh, actually using stereo sound, and, um, in the bonus material that's for the Konami Arcade Classic, they said that they used it by, um, using different, um, audio circuits.
6941955	6950637	The game was, uh, used a multi-core processor that had two Z80 microprocessors, a 60 to 9 microprocessor, and an 8039 microprocessor.
6951337	6956018	For the sound, it used an AY38910 PSG sound chip and a DAC.
6956946	6959067	for those who are into the technical side of it.
6960427	6972470	So, again, it's a cylinder, you shoot stuff when they come at you, you've got, you know, swirly things that come at you if you don't get the enemies in time.
6972950	6980612	The enemies that you have are satellites, asteroids, and laser beam generators, and they just show up and some of them disappear if you don't shoot them first.
6982032	6991482	So, for other things you have with the asteroids, they actually fly out from the center relatively regularly, and you still have to shoot them.
6991582	6999210	Then you actually get a, you have to make it to different planets as you're going through the different stages.
6999810	7005016	So you'll, like at first it says two warps to Neptune, so you have to go through a warp, and each warp is your stage.
7005716	7009077	And then after you land on the planet, you get a bonus round.
7009538	7011918	Where you have to shoot different ships for bonus points.
7012018	7014499	Kind of like Galaga or Galaxian.
7015720	7019181	And you basically go through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and finally Earth.
7019701	7021462	Where you've got three warps to get to each planet.
7021982	7027244	Stage one and every tenth stage afterwards, the enemies will not fire on you when you enter the screen.
7027364	7028604	Guess what the video just said?
7028784	7029025	What?
7029365	7030525	One warp to Uranus.
7031345	7031765	Whatever.
7034907	7040229	So as far as its arcade release, it had an upright and cocktail cabinets.
7040309	7041710	Cocktail machines are the best, I swear.
7042650	7056657	It saved the high scores in RAM, but there was a mod kit that was released on August 22nd, 2003, that would save the top five scores after the machine was powered off, so you could actually save the score on the machine.
7057097	7059298	That would be a great name for a video game blog.
7059398	7060798	Three warps to Uranus.
7062019	7062719	I'm sorry.
7063440	7064160	Patent pending.
7066175	7073110	Jairus was... If we ever go our separate ways and have to make new podcasts, my next podcast is going to be called Three Warps to Your Anus.
7075632	7077834	Jairus was ported to different early systems.
7077854	7087581	There was a version on Atari 2600, 5200, which I think I've got that one, the Atari 8-bit, the Commodore 64, Rob, and the ColecoVision.
7088261	7091984	Can we hear the awesome Commodore 64 SID chip version of Takata?
7092164	7094225	I guess as long as we can go back to the old one.
7094566	7095947	Yes, we can go back to the old one.
7095967	7096547	We can do the remix.
7096567	7098168	Wait, oh, that wasn't the full thing.
7098188	7098769	Hold on, look at that.
7106045	7108329	Oh man, the Commodore 64 version of this is so good.
7108369	7109371	Why is the light flickering?
7109431	7110793	Is that concerning any of y'all?
7110873	7112435	It's just that the light bulb's going out.
7121930	7124211	This is the version I play, like non-stop.
7125172	7125872	I love this game.
7129153	7132014	Okay, sorry.
7132955	7133575	Play the remix.
7134475	7136896	Remember that showed up in Beatmania?
7137056	7137557	I can do that.
7137597	7138677	I was going to do that during the break.
7138917	7139978	Okay, we'll just do it in the break.
7140359	7142200	That means everyone has to stay listening through the break.
7142581	7148227	Okay, there was a NES port version that was basically a very faithful arcade reproduction.
7150209	7159798	It actually had some changes, but the really faithful version came out was the Konami Arcade Classics for PlayStation and the Konami Collector Series Arcade Advance for Game Boy Advance.
7160559	7162060	There are different bootleg versions.
7162080	7163220	There's one called Venus.
7165181	7174324	There is one called Inu that was done by Italian hackers, which I guess it had more scooters, more Vespas, and people going chow.
7176630	7179512	Eddie is our reference.
7180792	7184214	They are working on trying to restore versions on MAME.
7185235	7193479	So there's actually... And this is what pisses me off about how awesome everything came out on the Famicom Disk system.
7195040	7198922	Gyruss was one of the games that was a Famicom Disk.
7199562	7201343	And it had a neat looking logo.
7201363	7203224	It had the Konami logo over the top and...
7203844	7206187	It had Spaceship and Earth and everything.
7206968	7211153	And then Ultra Games brought out a version that was kind of butt.
7211173	7215799	I didn't think it was butt.
7215859	7217701	I thought it was pretty good for an NES.
7217841	7219082	I'm talking about Logo Rob.
7219503	7219964	Oh, yeah.
7220824	7223765	What happened though with it is it updated the graphics.
7224885	7229726	The music from the arcade version was slightly remixed.
7230007	7231007	There were additional tracks.
7231887	7234288	You start off with three warps to Neptune instead of two warps.
7234308	7237369	You get a super phaser attack with the normal gun.
7237809	7242590	You have extra enemies, boss fights, bonus stages, an ending to the game.
7243210	7246672	and in the NES version it says something about the universe being at peace.
7247813	7250134	In the Famicom Disk System you get a full ending sequence.
7250314	7250774	How's that?
7252656	7262001	You've got 39 looping stages instead of the 24 and on the NES version you actually play through the entire solar system including the Sun and Pluto.
7262781	7266323	The Konami code will work for Extra Lives however you have to enter it in reverse.
7266944	7271006	So A, B, A, B, right, left, right, left, down, down, up, up instead of the
7271761	7273203	You know what happens to the trivia?
7273323	7276967	If you do the regular Konami code in Parodius, it kills you.
7277367	7278469	Yeah, I was gonna say, I think it does that in Gyro.
7278509	7280651	If you do it reverse, then you do it Gyro style.
7280671	7284235	I think it does that in, um, um, Gradius IV, I think.
7284255	7285116	Yeah.
7287518	7293222	That version of the game is also included in the Majesco TV game Konami Collector Series.
7294342	7296344	Not the Game Boy Advance ones.
7297685	7303209	As far as other modern versions come out, like I said, there were the Game Boy Advance version, the PlayStation one.
7303949	7306251	You can get it on Xbox Live Arcade.
7306511	7308012	It's a TigerCon chat.
7308052	7311375	It says they should remake Gyruss, like same gameplay style but HD graphics.
7311395	7314397	I'm like, it's on Xbox Live Arcade.
7315057	7315838	You might have missed it.
7316338	7322979	So is, for anyone who's interested in other games that I've covered, R-Type is available that way, and it's really fun.
7324219	7331721	Also, there's a clone of the game that exists as a minigame in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
7332821	7344663	And like we mentioned earlier, Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2, there is a Gyrus remix, and it's also available in Game Room for Xbox 360 and Windows-based PCs.
7345883	7346684	So, there you go.
7348845	7349186	Jairus.
7349466	7350146	There it is, folks.
7350166	7352588	By the person who gave us Street Fighter.
7353029	7356051	I do have like a short Konami side story based on that.
7356071	7356691	Uh-oh.
7356712	7357232	Please, go ahead.
7357792	7365899	Oh, it was just, we have our little weekly meetings and they talk about upcoming games that we're going to come in to test and one of them was Time Pirate.
7366579	7367680	Time Pirate Time Pirate
7388970	7390851	But it's the same guy.
7390911	7395853	As soon as you mentioned that, I was like, oh, that totally reminds me of that story where we all were stupid for a week.
7396033	7400915	I always keep forgetting that it's the same person did 1942 in Street Fighter.
7401495	7403996	So, I mean, that's sort of the big tie-in.
7404916	7407337	A whole series of classic games right there.
7407357	7411899	I like finding the awesome people that installed so much of my childhood.
7412439	7413180	Yeah, that is pretty cool.
7414400	7416321	I spent a lot of time on a gyrus when I was...
7417518	7419745	Much younger and not paying for school.
7422374	7423899	Paid with my sanity, maybe.
7425652	7451729	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Gyruss Don't go anywhere guys, we've got more of Orange Launch Radio to come Part B is going to be a little different this week, we're going to do rapid fire news And then we're going to not do any more news after that, we're going to do some discussions We're going to do top game of the week, disappointing game, I'm sorry, top game of the week Top game of 2012, disappointing game of 2012, Fugo question of the week, mailbag, lots of stuff coming up after the break And, no 3D cock

7489824	7499847	And we're going to get into some of our favorite games of the year and things we weren't so thrilled with this year, as is customary to do on a year-end special.
7499927	7504088	It's our totally cliche year-end special coming up a little later.
7504128	7509289	But first, we're going to travel around and get some rapid-fire news, the last news of the year that we're going to talk about.
7509429	7509689	Loki.
7510495	7511496	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7526052	7527472	I'm trying to remain optimistic about it.
7527532	7529673	Multiplayer worked out very well for Mass Effect 3.
7529773	7536035	I saw Assassin's Creed 3's multiplayer over the Christmas holiday when we were watching somebody else play it.
7536075	7536936	It looked interesting.
7537036	7538796	I was like, that looks kind of fun to play.
7539837	7541077	Multiplayer is not all bad.
7541497	7542818	Yeah.
7543439	7546902	Of course, there's the Humble Indie Bundle 7 that was out.
7547002	7550906	Now, of course, like they do with most of the Humble Indie Bundles, they add stuff to it.
7551046	7563577	So now, if you pay over the average, you get Dungeon Defenders, plus the DLC Legends of Grimrock, the Basement Collection, Offspring Fling, and Cave Story Plus, which is not bad.
7563838	7564759	And yeah, I had to pick it up.
7564959	7566040	Cave Story is awesome.
7566420	7568823	Yeah, but it was also in a prior Humble Bundle.
7568923	7570845	That's alright, that's alright.
7570905	7573527	This is Cave Story Plus.
7573567	7574348	It was Cave Story Plus.
7574849	7575129	Was it?
7575609	7576010	Yes, it was.
7576090	7577631	Which one was it then that had that?
7578032	7578953	Two years ago, I think.
7579193	7579713	Yes, it was.
7580134	7582096	It wasn't six, it was four or five had it.
7582396	7582656	Really?
7582997	7583137	Yep.
7584687	7589712	because I've bought all of them since like... You better check your Steam library again.
7589752	7590913	You probably have Cave Story.
7591333	7591954	You just forgot.
7593435	7594816	Problem of Steam sales.
7595517	7596738	I forgot I own the Steam.
7596758	7597419	Seriously.
7597639	7598800	I just bought another copy.
7600091	7600612	Humble Bundle 4
7619389	7622030	I'm swimming in copies of Metro 2033.
7622110	7623811	It's like I have like four of them.
7623891	7624551	It's ridiculous.
7625792	7626232	But anyways.
7627533	7628793	So yeah, Humble Bundle.
7628813	7629513	It's awesome.
7629694	7630854	You should definitely pick it up.
7631674	7634776	They've got the indie game, the movie in there, Shank and all that fun stuff.
7634976	7636917	And Cave Third Plus if you haven't played it.
7637037	7638197	Like I haven't played it yet.
7640878	7642679	There's going to be a lot of indie game playing in 2013.
7642719	7644020	I won't tell you that much.
7644620	7647863	That one also came with Super Meat Boy Shank and Bitcher Brunner.
7648063	7648883	Be quiet, be quiet.
7663855	7667076	from, what can I assume, probably like a GameStop or something like that.
7667116	7669656	It's called Call of Duty Black Ops 2 Revolution.
7669676	7673297	It's going to include five maps, one of which is a zombie map.
7673597	7684520	They have Hydro, looks like a dam, Downhill, which is a ski resort, Grind, which I can't really see in this picture at all.
7684940	7687961	They had a better picture when it was on here.
7689861	7690181	Let's see.
7690301	7690741	Oh, here we go.
7691582	7692322	Okay, so...
7694881	7701168	Grind, which appears to be like a skate park or something, which is kind of cool.
7701788	7705212	Mirage, which looks like maybe like an Asian environment.
7705232	7706813	They got a lot of pagodas in the background.
7707054	7710557	And Die Rise, which is a zombie map on a high rise.
7710797	7714081	Plus they also give you this bonus Peacekeeper submachine gun.
7714361	7741167	apparently coming out on the 29th of January and it's supposed to be exclusive I think for the Xbox 360 for a while which makes sense they've been doing that in the last few Call of Duty games I'm kind of excited about it I'm looking forward to some new maps because we're kind of we played out the ones on Black Ops although I'm also looking forward to the rest of my co-workers fucking getting that game so I can play with more than just one other person because it's kind of annoying we're all on Modern Warfare 3 and
7743564	7746349	Yeah, I had to kick their ass on Friday, so I won the year.
7748133	7748754	So yeah, that's it.
7750220	7762443	Alright, well I have a few new stories for you too, and one of them is another retro collection coming to iOS and iPads and iPhones and all that good stuff, and very interesting, it's an Infocom collection.
7763203	7774306	You may not remember that name, but they did all the classic text adventure games back in the day, like Zork, Zork 2, Zork 3, I believe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was one of their games too.
7774386	7777347	It's not in this bundle though, I thought it was.
7777947	7802038	Yeah, Enchanters in there, Infidel, I remember that one, Planetfall, Witness, Wishbringer So anyhow, we're spouting off all these names of games that are in the Infocom bundle 27 classic adventure games, but it is $10 Like a lot of these collections, you can get the Core app for free The free one will come with Zork 1, so you get that for free You can be eaten by a Gru to your heart's content
7803018	7808542	After that, you can get five packs of games for three bucks a piece, or you just get everything for ten bucks.
7808882	7812664	You can also, for I think a dollar, buy these things called Invisi Clues.
7813044	7814565	They're the hint booklets for the games.
7815146	7827393	I have not checked out this collection myself, but I'm told that they have like compasses and some additional features that you didn't have back when it was just text on an Apple IIe or a Commodore system, you know, when they didn't have anything besides that, but...
7829213	7833035	It's fun for like five minutes, and then you realize, boy, games got a lot better.
7835195	7841457	Nintendo Power's last issue ranked the top 285 Nintendo games of all time.
7842397	7844698	285, and you might ask, why such a weird number?
7844778	7848159	Well, that's because there were 285 issues made of Nintendo Power.
7848659	7852340	So that goes all the way from 285 Super Star Wars on the Super Nintendo,
7855922	7858163	All the way to number one.
7858604	7862506	What does Nintendo Power believe was the best Nintendo game ever made?
7862846	7863146	Thoughts?
7863186	7863587	Don't look.
7863687	7865428	Regular Nintendo or Super Nintendo?
7865548	7868310	Any Nintendo platform, but it had to be on a Nintendo platform.
7868430	7870731	Best game ever made on a Nintendo platform.
7870771	7871531	Super Mario Brothers.
7872572	7876414	That was number... The original Mario Brothers was number 16.
7877295	7877915	Link to the Past.
7878316	7880357	Link to the Past was number two.
7880797	7881658	Super Mario World.
7881858	7883899	If that was number two, then I'm going to say Ocarina of Time.
7884247	7886269	Oh, I was gonna say that.
7886610	7887991	The number one overrated game.
7888011	7891635	There should have been one.
7903706	7923723	7, Mario 3 6, Mega Man 2 5, Mario World 4, Final Fantasy 3 or 6 3, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Zelda A Link to the Past 1, Zelda Ocarina of Time Zelda Arena of Time Where's Mario Kart?
7923743	7928728	11 is Skyward Sword 12 is the original Legend of Zelda If you look at the top 16
7930569	7942059	They are all Mario and Zelda games, with the exception of 8 Super Metroid, 6 Mega Man 2, 4 Final Fantasy 3, and get this, at number 13, this surprised me, Elite Beat Agents.
7942820	7943680	Where's Secret of Mana?
7944501	7945382	Secret of Mana?
7945422	7946263	Good question.
7946283	7946963	Earthbound.
7949285	7949645	Secret of 88.
7949705	7950566	Fuck them.
7951547	7952007	Fuck them.
7953624	7955225	Earthbound Earthworm Jim Earthbound 156
7972668	7974009	Secret of Mana beat it out.
7974229	7977932	Between Maniac Mansion and Final Fantasy V Advance.
7978273	7979474	Games released in the US, right?
7979834	7984197	Let's just say there's a reason that they pulled the plug on that magazine and that list will demonstrate it.
7984478	7987920	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
7988021	7988721	Stop getting angry.
7988761	7991583	I will cut a bitch.
7992424	7993405	One other thing for you guys.
7993465	7998729	Did you know that not only is the Wii U region locked, but the gamepads are region locked as well?
7998989	7999590	LOL what?
8000143	8000824	Here's the thing.
8001304	8015533	If you actually try to bring another region's Wii U pad and hook it up or whatever, when it tries to do the console updates, it'll actually tell you the update cannot be completed with an overseas Wii U game pad.
8016174	8018255	I don't know why the fuck anyone would ever need this.
8018635	8020757	Why would you be using some other region's game pad?
8020937	8023999	For when they inevitably do fun colors in Japan that we don't have.
8024679	8029623	But then you'll have your own... When you buy the unit, you'll have your own... How many spice-colored...
8031044	8032525	GameCube pads do I have?
8032585	8034507	I think this is a little ridiculous to get angry over.
8034567	8037570	Let's get angry over the fact that the Wii U itself is not region locked.
8037650	8039051	That's where we should be focused on.
8039372	8040273	It is region locked.
8040433	8040973	I know, right?
8041073	8041894	That's what we should be focused on.
8041914	8042355	You said it's not.
8043255	8043436	Huh?
8043616	8044116	You said it's not.
8044136	8044437	Oh, my bad.
8044517	8045037	It is regional.
8045057	8045618	Well, let's be mad.
8045658	8046418	Let's just be mad.
8046919	8047920	Let's just be mad at Rob.
8048180	8049101	Rob Grr.
8049441	8049541	No.
8050602	8061370	Anyhow, yeah, I mean, if whatever, okay, and then people are saying, well, what if someday the games do support two gamepads and you have a friend from Europe over?
8064192	8065393	Fucking get over it.
8065493	8067414	God, then you just fucking get over it.
8067474	8068035	That's what you do.
8068395	8069716	You suck it up and you get over it.
8072017	8072858	Then you don't play that game.
8074389	8086014	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8086054	8086915	Last stories of the year.
8088195	8090317	Okay, well, Super Mario Bros.
8090677	8094939	3 is going to be on the 3DS Virtual Console in Japan.
8095759	8101182	It's coming out in the new year, and we don't really know when it's going to come out over here, but it's 500 yen.
8101202	8101282	Yay.
8101322	8101482	Yay.
8103700	8103900	What?
8120305	8121747	This is why your magazine went bankrupt.
8121787	8122207	I'm sorry.
8122748	8123649	Burn the infidels.
8123929	8125832	Hashtag sorry not sorry.
8125892	8127293	The Guardian legend's not on it.
8127393	8128835	Neither is Excite Truck, so you know what?
8128855	8129236	Fuck that.
8129336	8132780	The best racing game and I think launch title of the week.
8132820	8134301	Sharpstick Eyeball.
8134321	8134301	286, 287.
8134362	8134862	Go figure.
8135303	8136584	The Wii Sports Resort?
8137105	8138086	Sharpstick Eyeball.
8141144	8144426	So, guess what's coming to Battlefield 3 since I just mentioned a second ago?
8144967	8145487	Dirt bikes.
8146127	8147028	But no Camaros.
8147648	8157655	They are going to be adding offered dirt bikes and mechanized horses to Battlefield 3 for the fifth mini-expansion endgame.
8158335	8161137	And new maps and capture the flag will be out.
8161717	8167521	Then there will be lightweight AA vehicles and new trooper drops that will poop troops all over.
8169062	8170423	And last but not least...
8171761	8175263	There's a trailer for a game that people are losing their shit about.
8176023	8182106	Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII That's what Rob sounds like on the toilet when he loses his shit.
8183887	8184868	You're disgusting.
8186008	8187289	You were the one who lost your shit.
8188790	8199735	So, Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns Basically, it looks kind of like Assassin's Creed style play with Final Fantasy people in it.
8200908	8201548	Okay, I'm done.
8203109	8203629	Alright.
8203649	8207491	And that's what I said when I saw, you know, Lightning Returns.
8207551	8208772	I'm like, I don't even care.
8208832	8209292	I'll buy it.
8209572	8210693	I'm not even going to try and lie.
8210753	8211473	Of course I'm going to buy it.
8211493	8212334	Rob's our consumer whore.
8212374	8213034	I have the other two.
8213114	8214135	Heart, heart, heart, heart.
8214535	8214835	Alright.
8215715	8216576	That's it for news.
8217736	8221940	But we do have some other things we want to talk about before the show is over.
8222020	8224902	We want to get to 2012 in review.
8225042	8227984	And this is where I would usually play like a bumper or something.
8228024	8229426	I don't really have any bumper or music.
8229506	8232288	So when in doubt, just play Dancer.
8235044	8236146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8250302	8255626	The question that we are really asking is, what is your top game of 2012?
8256246	8259748	Because we don't want to get into that whole, you're wrong, you picked the wrong game.
8260148	8265552	Nope, there's no right or wrong answer to what your, or my, top game of 2012 is.
8265572	8267453	Opinions can't be wrong, they're just stupid.
8267653	8268574	Exactly.
8269214	8273177	So we'll get to this in the Fugle Question of the Week in a minute as well.
8273477	8276139	But we want to talk about what was your top game of 2012 and why.
8276159	8276239	Okay.
8278649	8278749	Garis
8290393	8291354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8315013	8318637	and tweaking the game and figuring out how I can push boundaries in it.
8319478	8324022	I think I finally figured out how to get all the high-res textures to work in Mass Effect 3.
8324503	8326365	So that's going to be for my seventh playthrough.
8328867	8330049	I made an albino shepherd.
8330109	8331030	I made a blue shepherd.
8332214	8333734	The modding is so much fun for me.
8334114	8338855	I will spend three hours working on getting my character to look right before I even do a mission.
8339876	8342856	You're such a girl.
8342976	8343376	Shut up.
8343456	8346717	It's like having The Sims and then actually having a good game.
8349598	8350018	Fair enough.
8350198	8350338	And?
8350898	8351038	And?
8351538	8351878	Garrus.
8352698	8353239	Shakerian.
8353919	8355019	It's Shakerian Sunday.
8357719	8362964	I posted a picture on MassAffecting.tumblr.com When is Shenko's Saturday?
8363224	8364605	I guess so.
8365005	8365946	Shenko's every other day.
8366367	8370090	No, but it said Shakarian, deal with it.
8370720	8375081	Alright, let's do some of the ones that are going to be a little less obvious.
8375722	8378442	Let's go to our guest, Flacco Jones, and then we're going to do Alan as well.
8378542	8379123	Flacco Jones.
8380063	8380883	For best game?
8381643	8382404	Yeah, your favorite.
8382444	8384244	What's your personal top game of 2012?
8385044	8396448	I kind of, you know, I had to make a decision because I played two really great games this week, but I'm going to stick with The Walking Dead just because I just love the story and I love how everything you do in the game comes back and...
8397348	8424870	and it all mattered so it was a great game and you know not terribly long and a pretty good deal like I know you guys are saying you got it for 10 bucks I got it for 20 and I still felt like that was a great deal because it's about 2-3 hours a chapter and you got 5 chapters so 10-15 hours for 20 bucks I think that's pretty good 10 bucks even better fair enough Alan is back with us in studio how are you doing?
8425650	8425850	Good.
8426230	8427851	So what would be your pick for Game of the Year?
8428171	8435472	Well, I almost had to recuse myself from this entire segment because I went through the Wikipedia list of all the games that came out in 2012.
8436813	8438813	I've played three of them all year.
8439953	8446195	So it doesn't mean that Mass Effect was the only thing I played, but all the games that I put hours on this year were from last year, 2010, 2009.
8447615	8449895	So I had three things to choose from.
8450436	8451436	Black Mesa Source.
8452676	8480515	it's my best because it came out finally after eight years so it proved all the haters wrong Half-Life got some love and it's just a huge testament of what fan communities are capable of it was flawlessly professionally done and when I say the mod community I mean Skyrim any community that has or any game that has a community that of people that will put out content like this Black Mesa is one of the pinnacle achievements of
8481676	8505113	everything Minecraft any game with a big enough fandom that lets you add stuff to it so yeah it plays awesome Half-Life hasn't had a game come out for it since 07 with Half-Life 2 episode 2 more time has passed between Half-Life 2 and now than the original Half-Life 1 got its sequel Half-Life 2 so yeah it's my favorite franchise and it got some love so that's my pick
8506840	8510642	You've watched me play a ton of games, and surely you can form an opinion out of that.
8510662	8512122	It doesn't count if I don't play it.
8531242	8532204	Use your own criteria.
8532564	8533545	The rest of the internet does.
8535087	8538331	Loki, what is your top game of 2012?
8540133	8545940	Also, I didn't play that many games during 2012 that came out in 2012.
8546080	8548483	It was like a handful of games.
8548983	8578185	I'd have to say probably Borderlands 2 just because it's everything you like from Borderlands 1 plus better writing, more guns and it's just it's fun, it's like everything you loved before amped up to 11 it's great, it's a great game great shooting, lots of I love the writing in it I don't know, I'm really enjoying it I'm enjoying the fact that I'm going back and playing it some more because I kind of stopped playing it for a while when I got busy with Minecraft and everything
8581882	8583964	That leaves me, huh?
8584324	8593532	I didn't really want to be predictable this year, but I reserve the right to change this because I still have one or two games I need to finish playing.
8593932	8597035	So I reserve the right to come back on a future episode and say I changed my mind.
8597455	8626930	but I think it's going to take a lot to sway me from choosing Mass Effect 3 as my game of the year and a lot of that has to do with the fact that I got into the series this year so I kind of feel like I explored the whole trilogy this year so admittedly a little bit of that spilling over into Mass Effect 3 but it's not really just what Jamie mentioned because what's funny about what she's talking about is that's not what interests me at all in the game and I think that's a testament to the game itself I think the staying power of Mass Effect 3 is the multiplayer
8627390	8634193	and I'm going to admit, when I first reviewed the game here on OLR, I said I won't give it my game of the year because some of the things in multiplayer ticked me off.
8634293	8641496	However, I think they've come a long way in correcting some of that, meaning that they have supported the multiplayer
8642728	8644129	Thanks for watching!
8664262	8674328	and you know had some great time playing with friends the game as well there really isn't a game I've had a better value on this year with the exception of maybe World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria
8674898	8675418	for the record.
8675859	8677240	I really like multiplayer as well.
8677380	8678721	And you know, I thought I would hate it.
8679922	8681103	And I ended up really liking it.
8681623	8687207	I also like finding regular maps in the game that are actually the multiplayer maps later on.
8687667	8695393	So all that ending bullshit aside, it's not enough to really tarnish what I still feel was an amazing video game.
8695793	8696354	However...
8697294	8713203	uh there was a lot of great shit this year and you know Journey really I was really almost wanting to name that just so that we could all have a different one but then I go back and I go but I all the time I spent on Mass Effect 3 I can't I can't Walking Dead however I
8714272	8715053	might take the crown.
8715153	8719295	If anything's going to snatch the crown, wait till I finish Walking Dead Episode 5 because I might snatch it.
8719455	8719896	So we'll see.
8720676	8724999	Because, you know, when the writing is good, it's like really, really good.
8725039	8729662	And like Walking Dead has a lot of what I love about Mass Effect, just in a totally different type of universe.
8730022	8735886	But the whole like decision making that kind of comes back later on, it's just, yeah, there's a lot of that there too.
8735986	8737567	So I reserve the right to change my answer.
8738307	8739148	It's just the internet.
8740469	8743911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8769611	8770131	What about it?
8770732	8774034	It didn't play well, the whole Mega Man thing.
8774654	8778096	It just felt like a giant insult to the people who were fans of the series.
8778216	8780797	I can't help but think of the DLC being on disc.
8780877	8782258	That's what I'm always going to think of.
8782598	8790683	It's just a combination of a less than stellar game combined with really poor business decision.
8791623	8795426	The fiscally responsible part of my brain just goes, no, can't do it.
8795466	8796666	And keep in mind, I didn't buy it.
8796746	8797327	I borrowed it.
8798207	8799848	and I gave it back.
8801049	8802971	So it was pretty bad.
8804452	8804992	Who went next?
8805032	8805653	I think Flacco.
8805693	8808154	Flacco, what would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012?
8808255	8810416	Well, I didn't play it.
8810496	8812097	So I guess that's why you can say it's not the worst game.
8812117	8818182	But I was very disappointed that I heard so many bad things about the Silent Hill HD remake.
8818302	8819042	That was pretty bad.
8819403	8819703	Yeah.
8819803	8821524	See, I've never heard anything good about it.
8822965	8839196	and it's just I was very disappointed because I was very I was very much looking forward to it I was gonna buy it right away but you know I guess luckily Target didn't have it when it came out and then I heard more and more about it and I was like you know I'm not gonna buy it it sounds like it's a waste of money there's also that crap with them not doing the upgrade
8840637	8842739	Yeah, that was for 2, right?
8843359	8844240	In the 2 and 3 collection?
8844380	8846561	They didn't upgrade the graphics?
8847482	8848803	Or they didn't do the fog or something?
8848823	8850624	And the wires are going off into the distance?
8850704	8855588	It was something about them having done a patch for other versions, but not the Xbox one, I think?
8856168	8857129	Oh, I don't know about that.
8857509	8858610	See, that's the thing.
8858630	8861111	There's so much bad news about that game.
8861492	8862452	And so many bugs.
8862913	8864574	And to release a game with that many bugs...
8865174	8867076	It's just too much.
8867096	8870198	They needed their best tester back, Jim.
8870238	8871159	That's the problem.
8871219	8872880	You left and everything went to hell.
8873360	8874081	How did this get through?
8874221	8875442	Get the waiting guy back.
8875942	8880165	I almost wonder if they took the viewpoint of, you know, we already tested this game.
8880225	8880726	It's fine.
8880746	8882147	We're just going to up-res it and stick it out.
8882587	8884168	It was a total disaster, it sounded like.
8884208	8885750	I don't know anybody who bought it and liked it.
8888332	8889072	Oh, Alan.
8889152	8889693	Alan's next.
8889833	8892314	Alan, what would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012?
8894548	8898030	Mass Effect Infiltrator for iOS and Android.
8898050	8915581	Yeah, that was kind of... Because I got my first smartphone ever finally in September and then I figured out that the data pad, which is like the sort of your characters in your party email you and it's really neat and you can update your galactic readiness, which is a mechanic in Mass Effect 3, through this app.
8915641	8916802	It's not available for the Android.
8917762	8922129	So only iPhone users get to do the little cute email character minigame.
8922589	8928518	So I was like, all right, I'll get the other Mass Effect mobile game, Infiltrator.
8928638	8933805	You play as Cerberus, dude, and there's also ways that it ties into your three main campaign.
8934446	8950911	it's awful it's an amazing testament to how good graphics can be on smartphones nowadays but you play with your thumbs and it's really awful and it's not fun at all and it was like eight bucks that I wish I had back because I could buy lunch with that
8954040	8955821	It's not that good on iOS either.
8955941	8956541	Was it really $8?
8956661	8960762	I think I got it on sale for $8.
8960802	8962603	I want to say it was $12 originally.
8963043	8965084	I've heard it's no better on the iPad.
8965124	8966504	Didn't you uninstall it off your iPad?
8967144	8967745	Yeah, I did.
8967865	8969725	It takes up a gig and it was just a wasted gig.
8970325	8973266	No tangible controls makes it a bitch.
8973507	8974827	Does it work with the iCade though?
8976167	8977128	I don't know because I don't have one.
8977928	8979849	I thought that it worked with the iCade but I could be wrong.
8980109	8980409	It might.
8980609	8980869	I don't know.
8982133	8982793	Yeah, but that's all.
8983594	8987195	I'm trying to remember what the other game was that came out this year that I played.
8987275	8987715	Mass Effect 3?
8987795	8988755	Oh, Mass Effect 3, yeah.
8990356	8990996	Alright, fair enough.
8992277	8993357	Loki, then I guess we go to you.
8993397	8995918	What was your most disappointing game that came out this year?
8996300	8998681	Lollipop Chainsaw.
8998901	8999522	It was terrible.
9000502	9003464	It just wasn't a fun game to play.
9005205	9007746	It was just kind of like, oh, it's Suda51.
9007806	9010968	It's going to be so really crazy and edgy and stuff.
9010988	9013449	They tried that with Shadows of the Damned and it was just not very good.
9013469	9014070	That was a good game.
9014510	9014770	Really?
9015330	9016991	I liked Shadows of the Damned.
9017732	9018292	It was alright.
9018532	9019272	I liked what I saw of it.
9020253	9023895	It just wasn't to the level of what I wanted.
9024355	9025516	I don't know.
9028518	9030279	I'll drop a whopper on this segment.
9030319	9032780	I'm going to say the most disappointing game of the year was Diablo 3.
9034281	9034901	You know what?
9035282	9035542	Yeah.
9036662	9039884	And I don't really know how to put it into words.
9039944	9042706	It's not that I necessarily hate... I mean, here's the thing.
9043927	9048069	This is very much not... Diablo 3 was not the worst game of the year.
9048149	9054513	I would say the worst game of the year would be something like... I was going to say Sonic 4 Episode 1, but it only came out on the Windows platform this year, but...
9054893	9055593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9078559	9089562	Somehow the fun got sucked out over the 10 years between Diablo 2 and Diablo 3, and I think a lot of that was Blizzard really not listening to their fan community, so I think they're really going to have to go back and answer to that a bit.
9091083	9099205	So when you got Torchlight 2, didn't you think that the pick-up-and-go within the first 20 minutes of Torchlight 2 was way more fun than Diablo 3, but Diablo 3 was how many years in the making?
9100391	9126219	I enjoyed Torchlight 2 in the one hour I played it more than I did Diablo 3 and that says enough right there I think you're absolutely right Torchlight 2 is a better game than Diablo 3 in my opinion so that's that looking at some of the comments in chat room at live.vognetwork.com Fantaz says no way Diablo 3 should win game of the year sorry that's my personal answer I think it wins poop of the year
9126670	9130132	Act... Acidic Vampire says, disappointing doesn't mean bad.
9130192	9133193	I think that's a very important point, and yes, I agree with you on that.
9134013	9137515	TigerClaw says, oh yeah, Blizzard cancelled the Diablo 3 PvP mode.
9138756	9140837	They didn't cancel... well, Fifth Dream fills it in there.
9140957	9142537	They didn't cancel it, they just postponed it.
9142858	9147340	They basically... they realized it was... I mean, that said to me...
9148200	9149681	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9174056	9174957	This is a free expansion.
9174977	9177918	I didn't pay for it.
9178598	9190284	I never got my dance studio, but I think there's a big difference between a Warcraft dance studio and PvP, which has its very passionate fans, even in WoW.
9190524	9199089	We don't talk a lot about PvP on Horde House because not a lot of it play it, but there is definitely... One thing I learned this week, we haven't talked a lot about it during the show, but we have been...
9199969	9200690	Thanks for watching!
9223252	9224073	Lots of that.
9224353	9226414	Arena, Rated Battlegrounds.
9226894	9228955	If you're wondering, who's doing Rated Battlegrounds?
9229035	9230156	Just load up Twitch.
9230236	9233797	And I imagine any of the competing websites like Ustream and so forth, same story.
9233837	9235478	There's a lot of that scene going on there.
9235518	9237479	So it definitely has their passionate fans.
9239740	9241281	Alright, there we go.
9241942	9245103	So let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week, because that was everybody, right?
9245143	9245784	I didn't miss anybody?
9245904	9246364	Just making sure.
9247505	9251087	We asked a very similar question in our Fugle Question of the Week.
9252108	9261714	Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, smash it together, you get Fugle, a question, and we ask them one of the same questions we just asked you guys.
9262754	9263994	Holy fucking shit.
9264014	9266555	We got 25 responses on Facebook.
9266715	9266995	Yep.
9267215	9268735	I can't read all of these, you guys.
9268755	9270956	There were about eight after the first minute you posted it.
9271276	9272156	Yeah, I know.
9272236	9273357	And I looked before the show.
9273517	9274217	There was eight.
9274297	9275197	And I'm like, okay, eight.
9275257	9275857	I can manage that.
9275917	9277177	Now there are 25.
9277998	9281979	I am overwhelmed by you guys being so awesome and replying.
9281999	9283559	But there's no way I can read all those answers.
9283619	9284139	Oh, my God.
9284159	9285739	There's five on Google Plus, too.
9286100	9287780	There's five people on Google Plus.
9287920	9291701	Rob, if I have to read 10 emails, you have to read 48 little short responses.
9291741	9292081	All right.
9292321	9294401	There's five Google employees that listen to the show?
9295802	9297822	Alright, I'm gonna really run through these.
9297962	9299402	I apologize in advance.
9299742	9302703	I'm gonna really trim your answers to get everybody's answers out there, okay?
9305243	9308884	Actdeft says Dust and Elysian Tale is the game of the year.
9309204	9314865	Dust combines RPG, Metroidvania, and beat-em-up style gameplay to make a real fun game to play.
9315205	9318586	And can you imagine this game was made by only one person?
9318886	9319726	That's quite the feat.
9320166	9324130	I was not as huge into Dust and Elysian.
9324430	9324690	No.
9325471	9325832	Never mind.
9325932	9327994	I'm getting that game confused with From Dust.
9328594	9329255	Very different game.
9329295	9329655	Sorry.
9330076	9330456	Sorry.
9331237	9331477	Yes.
9331817	9335260	Dust was an awesome game that it was supposed to be an Xbox Live Indie game.
9335280	9336402	I have not played that yet.
9336722	9339765	And it actually was so good that it became an Xbox Live Arcade game.
9339865	9340325	Oh, okay.
9341627	9344032	Alright, so I will make it a point to check that out later.
9344112	9349324	I thought, when I first read it, I was like, oh, he's talking about that From Dust game that I played once, and I was like, nah, I'm not as into this.
9349905	9351749	You know, it's kind of trying to be populist or whatever.
9355017	9359679	RobbaBubbaBubbaBubba says, My 2012 pick is the iPad version of Pinball Arcade.
9359719	9362420	It has the most tables and they're all from actual tables.
9362500	9365140	The iPad is the right size for the portrait orientation.
9365260	9366441	Good, good tip.
9366521	9367581	Very good pick.
9369202	9371222	Nick M replied, he gave two answers.
9371362	9378405	Big Budget, Halo 4, citing 343's ability to pick up the franchise from Bungie and made the most polished Halo to date.
9378705	9379205	I gotta say...
9379665	9383767	Halo 4 was pretty rock-fucking-solid compared to some of the previous Halo efforts.
9384187	9385868	I really agree with what Nick's saying there.
9386708	9389909	Smaller Studio, Walking Dead, citing the emotional connection.
9391030	9394171	Redertainment says, Three very good games I've played this year.
9394251	9397372	Mass Effect 3, Dragon Age Origins, Assassin's Creed 3.
9397452	9399993	Remember, it's this year, which you've played.
9400673	9406856	When I think of a game that I've played throughout the year, got a lot of enjoyment out of, and shared with multiple people, Ticket to Ride on the iPad.
9408208	9409789	You know the old, the board game, the trains?
9410070	9411591	All right.
9411771	9415294	Justin M replied and said, Dokepon Kingdom for the Wii.
9415574	9419237	It was released a while ago, but me and my partner started playing it obsessively this year.
9420258	9423801	Good, not so clean because we make it dirty, Monopoly-esque fun.
9424401	9425522	Now I'm kind of curious.
9425542	9425803	What's it?
9426243	9428345	Good, not so clean because we make it dirty.
9428405	9431567	What's, like, insensitive jokes, or what's that all about there?
9432248	9432528	All right.
9435310	9435670	Let's see.
9435770	9437830	Let's get to some of the answers from Facebook.
9437850	9438191	You ready?
9438211	9438631	Here we go.
9439331	9440271	Degenerate Johnny.
9440791	9443172	I'm positive I'm not alone when I say Mass Effect 3.
9443672	9444053	Why?
9444573	9445013	Garrus.
9445973	9448434	Just out of curiosity, are you Degenerate Johnny?
9448534	9448994	No.
9449054	9449194	No?
9449214	9452315	All right.
9452355	9454776	DJ Ranma S said Final Fantasy Theatrhythm.
9455056	9456597	It was a unique music rhythm game.
9457731	9484081	Rob himself said Assassin's Creed 3 they did a good job in reinventing a system that's not broken but feels fresh and new with the reasons you liked past games that's very interesting because a lot of people are giving Assassin's Creed 3 shit I haven't played enough of it to see it either way but then again Rob here I am saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the year and there's a lot of people that give that series some shit so you know what I am sympathizing with you
9485869	9487871	Eric S replied, Tricoro.
9488491	9490032	Do you guys even know what Tricoro is?
9491013	9491713	I've heard of it.
9492794	9492974	Nope.
9493235	9493675	I've heard of it.
9493775	9494375	Do you know what it is?
9494996	9495156	No.
9495956	9497478	It's 2DX, Beatmania 2DX.
9497498	9497898	Yeah.
9497938	9498378	I think number 20.
9498418	9501120	That's why I don't know.
9501160	9504563	That's why I knew what it was because it's one of the Bimani games.
9504943	9507044	Eric S says, Tricoro, because it's Beatmania.
9508185	9510127	Cram said, Mass Effect 3.
9510407	9512068	I think the flaws were exaggerated.
9512448	9514490	By the way, Mass Effect podcast...
9516798	9518723	Don't give me that look, we're working on it.
9520649	9524232	Look forward to more exciting things in 2013 from OLR Studios.
9524332	9524592	All right.
9525313	9527635	Haseo Sumuragawa says Borderlands 2.
9528315	9530918	Handsome Jack is the most lovable bad guy ever.
9531258	9533460	Can't help to giggle when his echoes pop up.
9533560	9535722	That or Arkham City because Catwoman is a badass.
9535982	9540886	Actually, even though I didn't play Borderlands 2, that would be Dan's game of the year to say.
9541586	9543028	I have to say Mad Moxie is awesome.
9544629	9549393	Naaman Lights says on console Forza Horizon on PC Mists of Pandaria.
9550820	9554041	Gamer Girl said a mud called Oasis.
9554561	9556382	Taking it back to the muds.
9556462	9557222	That's awesome.
9557242	9557923	You know what a mud is?
9559343	9560123	That's familiar.
9561584	9563144	You log into the terminal.
9563204	9565425	Speaking of text adventures like Zork and all that shit.
9565445	9566205	Gemstone.
9566365	9568986	Imagine if you were playing a text adventure MMO.
9569907	9570927	That's kind of what a mud is.
9571147	9572588	You go into a terminal.
9572648	9574068	I don't think I've heard of that before.
9574508	9576829	They used to be much bigger like 10 years ago.
9577429	9578169	Oasis won.
9578189	9579530	That's the Ready Player One.
9581371	9582051	Oh, okay.
9582572	9582932	Alright.
9583773	9586175	GamerGirl says, I love this game because it's my first time playing.
9586215	9588137	Been playing since it came online a few days ago.
9588297	9588557	Love it.
9589738	9595283	DarkTetsuya says, I'm going to change it up and say DDR2 for the Wii because of a great song list.
9596826	9606292	Flaming Toilet God, I love that username says Journey Thanks to the communication limits there's finally a multiplayer game that doesn't make me hate people.
9606793	9614918	True story I was talking to, if you listen to Horde House you've probably heard of Sunshine He does the podcast with Spike, Game Boy
9616259	9637176	and he was talking to me, he'll probably talk about this on his show he was talking about his playthrough on Journey he finally played it for the first time and he said he had a companion that he had through most of the game too and at the very end the companion drew a heart in the snow aww as you have all the feels of that same moment as well that's like Les Mis level crying right there
9638016	9638496	at the end.
9639177	9639457	All right.
9639477	9642238	Yeah, I was always like really chatty in my thing.
9642258	9645819	I would just be constantly like, I would just be mashing and like, we got to go fast here.
9645859	9648901	So I'm just going to be like, follow me.
9649201	9650201	I know which way to go.
9650261	9651782	Watch out for the big stone dragon things.
9655101	9657623	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, wait, OLR Studios?
9657663	9658884	I thought you guys were VOG now.
9659004	9659784	No, we are VOG.
9660344	9666849	VOG is the network that many of the OLR Studios shows play on, such as Orange Andreo and Horde House.
9666969	9672132	But if you look at the way movies are made, sometimes the movie maker is not the same as the distributor.
9672792	9673813	Go research it on Wikipedia.
9674173	9674453	All right.
9675014	9680257	Meanwhile, Veronica S replies and says, Pokemon White version 2 because it's addictive.
9681058	9682279	Another Pokemon addict.
9682479	9683139	That's all right, though.
9683179	9684800	I know a lot of Poke addicts.
9685421	9687522	Ronnie B replied and said, Far Cry 3.
9688483	9690965	It motivated me to enjoy gaming again.
9690985	9692286	That's a pretty big endorsement there.
9692606	9693927	The environment is alive.
9694007	9698230	The AI acts responsibly, engaging, and overall a great game.
9698750	9699851	It's on Steam sale right now.
9701245	9713256	Ferdinand F replied and said Lone Survivor I haven't heard of that one but he says it scratched the Silent Hill itch I didn't realize I still had I will have to kind of earmark that we like survival horror so
9714805	9726689	Burr replied and said going by the number of hours poured into it Borderlands 2 same great gameplay refined into perfection and some of the most memorable and funniest lines of the year hands down honorable mention to Assassin's Creed Creed not
9736773	9764899	Ossifer replied and said Mass Effect 3 keeps coming back long after it's been released only to play through it again and explore new paths in the story or another ending to enjoy multiplayer endorsing that as well more answers Ragenator says Diablo 2 I know it's a 12 year old title but I just got it this year console wise it's a two way tie between Magic 2013 and Super Stardust HD those are two games on Playstation 3 I love the most and put the most time into
9766319	9772362	Acidic Vampire said, Mass Effect 3, a fantastic finale to a trilogy with the best characters ever written for a video game series.
9772582	9773522	That's a pretty big endorsement.
9774383	9778184	Luliana says, Mass Effect 3, it's just that awesome.
9778665	9784187	Even if I'd played more WoW hours spent, I really wish we got to do more with Rex, but still, ME3.
9785227	9787929	Dave Falcon said, it's Duke Nukem Forever.
9788089	9788389	What? !
9789974	9790714	There are no wrong answers.
9790734	9791695	There's no wrong answer.
9792235	9799199	Because I spent a good portion of 2012 playing it and Deus Ex Human Revolution because my fiance got me hooked on it.
9799739	9800339	Oh, okay.
9801060	9801420	I see.
9802440	9804762	You played it because you had to for the fiance.
9804782	9805242	That's all right.
9806162	9806482	P.S.
9806542	9807823	Happy New Year, my gaming friends.
9807843	9808944	Well, Happy New Year to you as well.
9810164	9811965	Gino L. said The Walking Dead.
9812345	9816948	It handled some pretty taboo concepts gracefully and changed the way I think about games.
9818191	9819932	Change the way I think about games.
9820012	9821673	That's pretty heavy right there.
9823755	9824936	Now I'm like super interested.
9826196	9829459	Shane from Horde House replied and said Mass Effect 3.
9829839	9831140	What a fucking shock.
9831520	9831820	Hey.
9832421	9834882	Most personally impactful game series I've ever played.
9834982	9835503	Runners up.
9835823	9838365	Persona 4 Golden and DJ Max Technica Toon.
9839565	9856210	SSJ100 Matt said I'm going to say NHL 13 while this is no surprise for me given I buy NHL games every year without fail this year is special with the current labor dispute and the possibility of there not being any hockey this year NHL hockey I have to look elsewhere for my hockey fix
9856690	9860612	Well, I do play and pick up hockey games in real life and go to minor league and college hockey.
9861012	9866255	NHL 13 is the only way to pay and watch my favorite players and teams play.
9866315	9867676	That's a depressing answer.
9867916	9868636	It is sad.
9868917	9871678	That's the only way to get hockey if you're in the NHL.
9871758	9872699	I totally get it.
9872799	9876300	And I think that's an awesome answer in many ways, especially if you're a hockey fan.
9876320	9876861	But it's just like...
9877821	9879322	It really puts it into perspective.
9880243	9881764	They need to fucking figure it out.
9882244	9885166	We have gone over the fiscal cliff in hockey is what has happened here.
9885186	9886727	And this just happened like six years ago.
9886767	9887928	They canceled their season too.
9887988	9888889	I think it was that long ago.
9889109	9889789	Shame, shame.
9889910	9891651	Baseball never recovered from that shit.
9892131	9893112	No, they have now.
9893132	9895073	They have now, but it took forever.
9895213	9899296	But when the next bargaining agreement came by, they signed it and they got it done right away.
9899336	9900417	They didn't drag this out.
9900437	9902958	And hockey's doing this now for the second time in less than 10 years.
9903098	9903339	Wow.
9904299	9925674	Codeman replied and said The Walking Dead I've never felt so emotionally attached to a game in a long while and this one definitely hooks you Last but not least Alpha Cananogram Hatsune Miku Project Diva F Even though the scratch feature is meh No wrong answers I know but I'm not surprised
9925954	9926454	Oh, okay.
9926874	9929315	Good music rhythm game with neat bonuses.
9929775	9930256	There you go.
9930436	9932356	I like the variety of answers there.
9932516	9933217	That was great.
9934197	9941359	It wasn't all... I mean, of course, there was some Mass Effect, Walking Dead, Journeys, the things you're going to expect to see, but I really liked hearing about some of those other ones, too.
9942380	9943440	Really, really neat.
9943500	9948902	So thank you guys for answering, and I went ahead and read just about every answer that actually had a game in it.
9949082	9949942	I read those answers.
9950443	9950963	So there you go.
9951926	9955230	Thank you Facebook, thank you Google, thank you to everybody who's participated.
9955891	9958895	Was that a new segment for this year or did we debut that last year?
9959455	9959796	This year.
9960296	9963320	So thank you for catching on to our new segment this year.
9963360	9963921	We appreciate it.
9965080	9966861	DarkSakura, read some emails.
9992133	9993134	This comes from Grimsley.
9994235	9996857	Because it's a person I haven't seen before, I'm reading it.
9996937	9997697	Because I'm nice.
9998398	9999379	Hey guys, love the show.
9999419	10002361	I was wondering what the name of the background song you used in one of your segments.
10002781	10005403	It starts out like Bela Lugosi's Dead, if that helps.
10006104	10007385	Hope to hear from you soon.
10007425	10008226	Happy holidays.
10009229	10011151	What do we have that sounds like Bela Lugosi's dead?
10011292	10017039	Honestly, because I could only think of the chorus of Bela Lugosi's dead.
10017339	10021684	So I went and YouTubed it and the beginning sounds an awful lot like this.
10023467	10024448	Oh, yeah, that's true.
10025782	10031186	The Google Song, La Bossa Nova de Fabienne from Beatmania.
10031466	10033288	It was in the hip hop mix in the US.
10033348	10037211	I think it's from some of the Japanese mixes too.
10037631	10043816	Anyway, what I did for this listener and for anybody who's asking questions like, what song are you using on Orange Lounge Radio?
10044296	10072482	I made a post in the VOG Network forums at vognetwork.com click on forums, click on Orange Launch Radio and there's a topic we get more people over there there's a topic, what music do you use on Orange Launch Radio and I gave you all the songs and links to the YouTubes so you can do what you want but how about for our listeners who aren't as in tune with the goth music scene, play a little Bela Lugosi's Dead I was just about to do that except you were like two steps ahead of me was that the entire email?
10073171	10074012	Yeah, pretty much.
10074813	10077575	I wouldn't mind reading the rest of the emails to Bela Lugosi's dad.
10077635	10083181	Hey, and if anyone ever watched, you know, early 2000s SNL, goth talk.
10083842	10088586	Ah, Azrael, Prince of Dark and of Sorrow.
10088606	10089848	Prince of Sorrow.
10089868	10092370	And he works with me at the Cinepan.
10092390	10097135	All right, here's the nine-minute mix of Bauhaus, Bela Lugosi's dad.
10101077	10103846	So I thought it has to be the Fugles song.
10105979	10106619	Uh, Bauhaus.
10107100	10110881	Named after my favorite art school that got shut down by the Nazis.
10112102	10112822	But reopened!
10113422	10116424	But then like all the way towards the end of the song is when it gets into the more familiar part.
10119245	10123807	But honestly, we would not have certain styles of furniture today if not for the Bauhaus movement.
10123827	10124247	Just saying.
10125868	10129309	Don't ever ask an art student to go off on stuff like that.
10129509	10131650	Anyway, this one comes from Spazinator.
10131710	10132331	Spazinator.
10133411	10133912	Hi, gang.
10133992	10136033	It's your raging neighborhood's raginator.
10136814	10140357	The strange thing happened that interrupted my plans to get a cat this weekend.
10140557	10141198	Let's take a minute.
10141238	10141938	Just sit right there.
10142499	10144881	I'll tell you how I became the catless raginator.
10145541	10150826	In Buffalo... Oh, he's doing it as a... Fresh Prince.
10150866	10153588	Fresh Prince, yeah, but I'm not going to wrap it.
10157371	10160114	You're moving with your auntie and uncle Garris on the Normandy.
10161297	10161917	It's a parody.
10161978	10162318	I get it.
10162378	10163278	Yeah, I'm not reading it.
10163379	10163659	Sorry.
10164079	10164719	Can I wrap it?
10165120	10167341	I just closed it, but you can do it if you want.
10169063	10169323	All right.
10170303	10172365	Ragenator, I will do your email justice.
10172425	10173546	Give me a moment to set it up.
10174186	10175607	Okay, I'm going to go ahead to the next one.
10176048	10180731	This is from Nasty Canasta, and I'm sorry, I don't speak any Spanish other than fuego.
10182572	10184133	So I'm going to try to pronounce this right.
10184294	10186655	Is hola y buenos burritos?
10187556	10189657	Hola y buenos burritos.
10190678	10195883	I would like to bring to your attention a game announcement that flew under the radar, the Binding of Isaac remake.
10196304	10198226	I'll only touch on major points announced so far.
10199387	10202290	Produced and developed by Nicholas, releasing at the end of 2013.
10203331	10210198	Currently confirmed for PC, PS3, and Vita, Nicholas is in talks with Nintendo and Microsoft to have the game on Wii U, 3DS, and 360.
10210759	10213562	The remake will support a new pixelated look similar to that of the GBA Zelda's.
10214202	10222365	All content from the base Isaac game and the Wrath of the Lamb expansion will be included, plus another batch of new content about as big as Wrath of the Lamb is in the remake.
10223105	10226727	Local co-op confirmed, no online co-op as that would extend development time.
10227247	10235590	Danny Baranowski returns to compose new and remixed tracks, new playable character, new ending, and new final level that seems likely to appear after the game's shale level.
10236070	10245816	Anyone interested in finding out more in-depth remake details can go to Edward McMillan's Tumblr at edmundm.com and the Binding of Isaac subreddit on Reddit.
10246317	10250519	I have also attached some mock-up screenshots made by Edmund himself, Happy Burritos, and Nasty Canasta.
10251400	10253721	And, yeah, I can't really link these to everybody.
10254061	10255102	Thank you for the reminder, though.
10255162	10255662	It was cool.
10255743	10260185	I remember reporting on this before because we were kind of joking, like, LOL remake of a game that's not that old.
10260506	10262207	But, yeah, I was interested in it, so...
10262967	10265088	By the way, Ragenator's email.
10265628	10277693	The problem is, at the end of it, he turns it into a Rickroll thing, and I'm still a little upset about the time he tried to Rickroll the show, so we are sending Ragenator, I will not be doing that email justice, and we will be sending that email to the round file.
10277753	10279574	So here you go, Ragenator, here goes your email.
10287717	10289478	Okay, this is from RawSteelUT.
10290379	10298245	Hey guys, now that we're all done with Christmas and getting our New Year's resolutions ready and shit, what are you guys looking forward to in the next year in gaming?
10298805	10299406	Any cool games?
10299466	10301327	Maybe some cool but ultimately useless gimmick?
10301387	10302048	Thoughts ahoy!
10302068	10304109	I'm playing more Mass Effect.
10304790	10309673	Hold that thought, because we have a list list coming up that is tackling this exact topic.
10309953	10310934	You read our minds.
10313136	10313816	Holy shit.
10314297	10317399	Off topic, one of my friends has a copy of the live-action Rurouni Kenshin movie.
10317950	10318631	Gonna watch it!
10319351	10319591	Okay.
10320972	10322454	Next up, I told you I was reading them all.
10323875	10330480	Dear Orange Jones Radio, first off, I would like to apologize for any grammar mistakes I may make as I have been very tired.
10330680	10332942	I love the whole covering my ass in the beginning thing.
10333582	10336224	If you cover your ass in the beginning, that's fine Alright
10357879	10384943	she asked if I had a girlfriend and I said that I had but things didn't go well she said well you know you could have told me and I wouldn't have cared one way or another because you're my sister I said well I was afraid because of our beliefs about quote that sort of thing she said are you crazy you're my sister and I care about you and love you so I just wanted to let you guys know that thanks to you all I finally got the courage to come out because of you all just to tell my sister how I felt thanks again sincerely gamer girl
10388174	10388274	Yeah.

10418991	10420892	and major congrats to you too.
10421613	10422293	Absolutely.
10422313	10426355	Sorry, I'm making it about us, but congratulations to you.
10426516	10430498	And I know that you and I have talked about other things too, so just keep your chin up.
10432123	10433624	Not you and me, Rob, but me and her.
10433704	10434424	I know, I know.
10434484	10434824	I got it.
10434964	10436004	Hey guys, Sterlach here.
10436524	10441386	A couple weeks ago, you guys were talking about Konami's VRC6 sound chip for the Famicom.
10442106	10444027	But did you know there was a step above that?
10444067	10450769	The VRC7 took the NES's sound capability to a whole new level, placing literally on par with the Genesis slash Mega Drive.
10451249	10458142	However, only one game used this amazing chip, being the Japanese-exclusive RPG Lagrange Point.
10458242	10460246	Okay, he linked to YouTube on it for how it sounds.
10461048	10463813	Rob, if you would actually pull that up for me, I would greatly appreciate it.
10464221	10467744	I will, sorry, I was yelling at Ranma in chat because Ranma said, who the fuck goes clubbing on Sunday nights?
10468104	10474949	We used to go, it's not around anymore, so we wouldn't, but the, don't make fun of us, but the goth club was Sunday nights.
10475210	10475390	The Rage.
10475550	10477211	It was the Rage, and they changed their name.
10477511	10477952	What was it called?
10477992	10478412	Asylum.
10478572	10481815	No, remember, we went to the Rage for my bachelorette party.
10481855	10488240	Yeah, I know, but that was, like, and people were- After all the vodka shots, the jello shots and watching Barbarella.
10488420	10490522	I've been asked, when was the last time you went to Asylum?
10490562	10492163	And I'm like, I don't know, when did I start OLR?
10494966	10496907	So anyway, I'm sorry, which one am I pulling up?
10496967	10497387	Oh, this one?
10497787	10499247	Yeah, from Sterlok.
10499688	10500348	Okay, got it.
10500588	10500848	Okay.
10501508	10503149	Yes, I wanted to play this.
10503729	10505270	Okay, so let's listen to a little bit of it, shall we?
10505290	10506730	I'm going to fast forward a little bit here.
10506770	10508991	Hey, coming up.
10511072	10512192	That's a Nintendo game.
10512412	10516493	That sounds very unlike most Nintendo games you're used to hearing.
10517894	10522916	I probably picked like a really boring part, but... Looks like Phantasy Star.
10523296	10523836	Sounds pretty good.
10529292	10529672	Go ahead.
10553198	10561102	I'm already most of the way through Chapter 2 of Leon's campaign and I'm through the trickiest section as far as accessibility goes, that being the bell puzzle.
10561722	10563022	Anyway, enough of my rambling.
10563102	10567284	I hope you guys are having an awesome holiday season and keep up the awesome job as always.
10567504	10567925	R.I.P.
10568005	10568385	Shermie.
10568745	10569185	Sterlock.
10571246	10571766	My baby.
10574207	10575988	That has been the sad part of my year.
10576668	10578949	You guys have made the holidays even more awesome.
10579890	10580170	Yeah.
10583703	10585264	Sorry, I was thinking about my kitty.
10585624	10586684	Looking forward, not backwards.
10586704	10587444	I know, I know.
10587764	10589464	It's tough.
10589664	10598546	This comes from Robert M. First, just hoping, is that Chiron Beta, Chiron Beta Prime was on your holiday rotation?
10599426	10607027	Secondly, if any of you have any experience with doing this, does anyone there or in chat know how well an Xbox 360 controller works on Mac OS?
10607487	10608368	Still a leopard or later.
10608748	10610628	Finally, does Minecraft support said controller?
10611508	10616271	I wouldn't know about the Mac side of it, but can you use the controller in Minecraft at all?
10616731	10617271	In Minecraft?
10617411	10618992	I use the controller all the time in Minecraft.
10619392	10621413	I use keyboard when I play.
10623274	10634520	In fact, if you play on our server, or you just have access to the VOG Network forums, for PC at least, I have an XPatter profile that you can use for the Xbox 360 controller that works perfectly.
10635060	10638742	It works almost identical to the 360 version, but not quite.
10638993	10642014	I'm fairly certain there are drivers available for Mac OS.
10643095	10649277	And I know it probably doesn't help this emailer, but the PlayStation 3 controller actually works with Mac OS.
10650858	10654499	And now I was told to stop reading this on the air immediately, this part of the email.
10654519	10655540	No, I'm not going to go any further.
10656260	10658421	It actually is for me and I'm forwarding it to my personal email.
10658781	10659922	So you'll hear from me there.
10661342	10662042	Sounds kinky.
10664303	10665324	Shut up, Rob.
10665904	10667245	It was actually really nice.
10667785	10668105	All right.
10670253	10671394	How does he know what you're wearing today?
10672455	10675699	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, alright When do I ever wear something that isn't black?
10677701	10690534	So you're saying they're black Yes Next email I love trolling you guys, seriously
10691587	10693009	Alright, two emails left.
10693550	10694351	Greetings, OLR.
10694391	10695593	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
10695973	10699058	Now that it's cold on the east coast, I need another form of exercise.
10699178	10700400	Well, we can't help you with that.
10701040	10703524	So I set up TDR in my unheated workshop.
10704105	10707149	I was totally getting back into it and I noticed that my score sucked.
10707970	10711513	I've played a few times since then and the left arrow works about 25% of the time.
10712073	10716156	So, Loki, do I buy, build, or hang myself from frustration?
10716716	10721380	I've researched a lot online and it's hard to find a good pad since they're not made anymore.
10721860	10725303	Even the metal pads you can find on eBay and Amazon get so-so reviews.
10725943	10728685	And should I stockpile new pads since dance games are dead?
10729105	10730086	What would you recommend?
10730186	10732008	Keep in mind that I'm budget conscious.
10732448	10735250	Good day, citizens, from your loyal turtle in Philly, SiriusTurtle.
10735768	10744811	Well, it depends on how much you're going to actually play, because I remember I've looked into great detail as far as pads go, but yeah, you're right.
10744831	10754714	A lot of them, they're pretty terrible, but there are mods you can do on some of them to make them not so bad, like some of the... I'm trying to think what pads they are.
10755094	10755975	Thanks for watching!
10770592	10772393	and Riptide Pad, I think.
10773014	10777296	And that one cost me, I think, $300 for two.
10777957	10779458	So that's not too bad.
10779838	10782700	And if you only need one, it's even cheaper.
10784501	10786542	And it wasn't too bad, it's just I didn't ground it right.
10786702	10791845	But now we're just going to remake the whole thing anyways because I have some sheet metal sitting in my garage shed.
10794485	10794805	I don't know.
10795226	10797647	I'd go with the home-built pad if you can do that.
10797848	10806614	Otherwise, the metal pads are alright, but just make sure if you do get one, it's a really thick pad.
10806654	10811158	I bought some metal pads that were about an inch thick and they bent.
10811798	10813560	It was really bad.
10814065	10822131	So just read reviews and ask on some of the music game forums, especially people that are using pads a lot.
10822391	10837102	And I'd say as far as being... Music console games are kind of dying, but if you want to do the PC simulator scene and that kind of stuff, you're going to have a lot more options available to you.
10837443	10840645	And that's probably not going to go away anytime soon, so that'd be the way to go.
10842890	10843232	Alrighty.
10843894	10846123	Alright, and the last email then, if we're ready?
10846465	10846666	Mm-hmm.
10847611	10858578	Hey OLR crew, AZHP here with an option or two on the news stories last week about online services for games like Neverwinter Nights being shut down whereas Star Wars Battlefront for PS2 is still running.
10859039	10876210	My quote friend who worked at GameSpy told me that when developers stopped paying their fees for their services to stay up, GameSpy would just not shut them down because getting a massive uprising of players getting butthurt that their online games were getting shut down was more trouble to deal with than just leaving the service up.
10876850	10883233	My guess is that Glue Mobile, the company that bought GameSpy from IGN, is realizing they've made a poor investment on GameSpy.
10883253	10889857	They paid about $45 million in stock for GameSpy, and the employees are jumping ship because they don't like the new direction Glue is taking them.
10890337	10895860	Found out about this practice and is trying to write some developers out for games they've stopped paying for.
10896080	10901422	And those developers are, surprise, not willing to pay for 10-year-old games and are just letting them get shut down.
10902803	10906724	and just my little insight into the world of video game business, you're truly AZHP.
10907625	10913547	I don't think it was that they were giving up on them, it's just that they were raising their rates so much that it's just not cost effective for them.
10913587	10916468	I mean, I think that's really what it comes down to.
10917208	10922289	I found that part fascinating that they'd rather keep them running than have to deal with the internet rage.
10922870	10924250	That says a lot right there.
10926831	10927211	That was it.
10929312	10929852	I'm eating.
10933604	10934724	No help, we have dead air.
10935525	10940266	Okay, Rob, jeez, you have to shove your face with stuff and have me fill in the time.
10940726	10943847	Garrus, Garrus, Garrus, Garrus, Garrus, Garrus.
10944327	10946788	I will keep saying Garrus until Rob finishes chewing.
10948468	10949348	How about FUs?
10950349	10950709	Okay.
10961623	10967968	FU goes to AAA because of claim issues from my car accident.
10968629	10980718	I may not be in a bad spot, but somebody else who was involved in the accident was for things that were proven on record to have been caused by the accident.
10981699	10983901	Gonna take it up with them and they may be losing a customer.
10986167	10986547	Loki.
10988089	10991932	I guess FU to the fact that there's no one on Final Fantasy XI.
10992412	10993813	It's kind of lonely.
10993934	11000259	I mean, I like the fact that now I can actually camp the Notorious Monsters if I want to and be able to attack them.
11000539	11001840	Leap and Liz, he's all yours.
11001880	11002581	No, seriously.
11002621	11003822	Like, I ran across them.
11003922	11005363	Hey, there's a Notorious Monster.
11005383	11006064	I'm going to fight it.
11006204	11008866	And I did, and I killed it, and I didn't actually get the drop.
11008906	11011128	But I was like, hey, that's kind of cool.
11011168	11012209	They added more of those to it.
11012449	11014010	Yeah, I've noticed quite a few.
11014950	11015890	So, it's neat.
11016971	11028115	And then, of course, you know, the fact that I've got some big projects I want to work on, and I've been just, like, brain-fried lately, and I just haven't been able to concentrate on them.
11028435	11031916	But some major stuff, hopefully, I'll actually work on this year.
11031976	11033456	I really need to focus on it.
11036059	11040026	Alright, my a few of the week goes to my co-host for not knowing how to fill dead air when I'm eating.
11040747	11042330	We didn't know you were getting food.
11042410	11043111	Jeez, Rob.
11044045	11044465	This is Rob.
11044485	11052933	F you to DarkSakura for furthering berating me during my F you segment.
11053153	11055956	And just F you to the fact that vacation is flown by.
11055976	11057537	I have to go back to work on Wednesday.
11057938	11058999	You do.
11059159	11059840	I know.
11059880	11061061	I have to get to work tomorrow.
11061081	11062322	No, it sucks to be you.
11062362	11063483	Wi-Fi's a whole week off.
11064144	11064864	Oh, my gosh.
11065185	11068588	But, you know, no, in all seriousness, it's been a great mental break.
11068808	11069949	So I'm like, I'm done.
11070109	11071110	I'm ready for 2013 to be a kick-ass year.
11071130	11071290	Woohoo!
11091607	11093928	By the way, can I throw in a happy birthday to a celebrity?
11094088	11094308	No.
11094768	11095008	Yes.
11095888	11096949	Michelle Nichols turned 80.
11097329	11097649	Today?
11098349	11099509	She is a flawless goddess.
11100049	11102290	She is pretty damn flawless.
11102430	11105791	I have to... She's actually one of my personal heroes.
11105811	11110752	I would say the only flaw I could think of possibly for her was that she participated in season two of Heroes.
11111012	11115734	But otherwise... Otherwise... She did a fan dance at 50.
11115814	11117394	That's awesome.
11117514	11117774	Yeah.
11117974	11118835	All right.
11118915	11120095	Flaco, you have an FU of the week?
11120739	11124590	Yeah, F you to vitamin water for making me pee like three times in two hours.
11124630	11125874	I'm not a pregnant woman, I swear.
11128965	11130485	You're just getting old like the rest of us.
11130505	11131446	Holy shit.
11131466	11133046	It's Vitamin Water's fault, not me.
11133226	11135947	Your half birthday just recently passed too because mine did.
11136027	11137227	I'm like, oh, I'm almost 35.
11137487	11138387	Yay.
11139007	11139287	All right.
11139367	11140548	Isn't it fun to be old?
11140608	11140908	Yeah.
11141168	11141508	All right.
11143108	11150490	Let us get to one more segment before we get to the other classic game of the week.
11150510	11151330	I'll explain in a minute.
11151610	11152810	And our Twitter topics and so forth.
11153290	11156071	It is a segment we like to call Listless.
11165015	11167116	Alright, the way listless works.
11167216	11169396	We are going to put together the ultimate list.
11169436	11171397	This is a very scientific process, y'all.
11171757	11173057	The ultimate list.
11173518	11175078	We're not going to have the theme music all night tonight.
11175278	11179679	The ultimate list to discuss the top three of a topic.
11180020	11184481	And that topic tonight is your 2013 predictions.
11185141	11185761	Ooh, okay.
11186381	11188042	So, here's the way listless works.
11188062	11192983	We're going to go around the room and the folks participating tonight are myself, DarkSakura, Loki, Flacco, and Alan.
11193023	11194524	We have a five-man listless tonight.
11195666	11198430	You have a four man and one woman listless.
11198450	11200833	We have a five person listless time.
11200853	11203276	There's a woman, so there you go.
11203556	11204037	You know what?
11204057	11205258	There's a woman.
11205519	11206780	My boobs dominate.
11206800	11207762	Alright, fine, fine.
11209724	11211265	We have four men and a nag.
11212366	11213046	Bitch, please.
11213106	11213726	I will cut you.
11213746	11215107	All right.
11215487	11216548	Doing tonight's list.
11216828	11217348	You know I love you.
11217548	11217749	All right.
11217769	11218509	We're doing tonight's list.
11218689	11220770	We're each going to go around, put three items on the list.
11220790	11222511	Then we will go around and it's a really tough thing.
11222551	11224432	We're going to take one answer off the list.
11224532	11227314	But there's a twist in tonight's list list.
11227714	11230736	This is a list list twist for 2013.
11230776	11233177	Twist list?
11233337	11234078	It's twist list.
11234958	11237580	Here's the deal because there's so many people tonight.
11238576	11247480	If somebody gets two of their answers taken from the list, their third answer automatically becomes immune and cannot be taken from the list.
11247961	11248861	Immunity Idol.
11248941	11250862	Immunity Idol for an answer.
11251002	11255164	So if you get two of your answers taken off the list, your other one cannot be eliminated.
11255184	11262808	May I suggest that we play the whole Tribunal song while we're doing the eliminations?
11262828	11264549	That might be kind of funny there.
11264569	11264929	Awesome.
11266488	11267469	I'll see what we can do.
11268330	11274795	Alright, so that's the twist this year with List List 2.0.
11275035	11278578	So anyway, in all seriousness, let's go around and start to form the list.
11278598	11282521	The chatters will then vote and they will get to put together the ultimate list.
11282621	11283342	By the way...
11283962	11303847	and I will throw this out there there actually is another upgrade coming to Listless in 2013 not just the upgrade I previously mentioned but we are going to have a way that podcast listeners can participate in this segment next year so stay tuned we are going to do one segment where the podcasters get to participate as well in 2013 so expect this segment to come back
11304167	11306749	DarkSakura, what is your number three answer for your 2013 prediction?
11332105	11335346	Reggie Fils-Aimé will actually reveal that he's Donkey Kong, just shaved.
11343128	11344509	And why do you believe this will happen?
11344529	11345569	Look at the man's face!
11346829	11348150	He's got gorilla face.
11349574	11352516	and like not Damon Auburn, Jamie Hewlett gorillas.
11352596	11354377	I mean, he looks like a monkey.
11354937	11355377	All right.
11356838	11357199	Wow.
11357279	11357779	I don't know.
11357979	11358439	I don't know.
11358579	11360560	That's I don't know.
11360901	11361261	I don't know.
11361741	11362982	That one might get eliminated right off.
11363002	11363342	We'll see.
11363702	11363942	All right.
11363982	11364603	Let's see, though.
11365583	11366404	Moving around the list.
11366624	11369766	Loki, what is your number three answer for 2013 prediction?
11370086	11371527	Final Fantasy 11 will go free to play.
11376767	11379048	and why do you feel that's destined to happen this year?
11379188	11388730	Because there's very few servers right now and there's hardly anyone on them and honestly if they went free to play I think they would get a lot more revenue.
11390551	11391431	Alright, fair enough.
11391551	11398133	And I understand they have Final Fantasy 14 over there and they want people to go to that but why wouldn't you want to keep your old service available?
11398213	11400513	I guess maybe not the cut into your new one.
11401233	11402154	I don't know, it's hard to say.
11403669	11407993	Alright, Flocko Jones, what is your number three answer?
11409174	11418082	PlayStation Vita versions of first party Sony games are actually going to be made by the same developers Oh, instead of like the whole like license thing?
11418582	11429692	Well, just like the whole like, yeah, like Uncharted, Naughty Dog doesn't do the Vita version Or LittleBigPlanet, Meet My Uncle doesn't do the Vita version Just stop pawning it off on one of your other developers
11431929	11434871	The Devil May Cry reboot will flop and bury the franchise for good.
11434891	11441356	The only good thing it will bring is really hot fan art of new Dante and Chris Redfield.
11458635	11460496	So there you go, the number three answer from Alan.
11460536	11464919	Devil May Cry reboot flops and the only good thing it brings is fanfic.
11465920	11466200	All right.
11467501	11469342	My number three answer, what did I do in my list here?
11469442	11476626	Oh, my number three answer is that there will be a Vita price drop before the one year anniversary, which is in a couple months.
11476686	11480109	And I honestly, I don't think they have any choice at this point.
11480569	11485252	And I would almost go so far as to say the 3G one gets eliminated totally because why?
11485592	11487333	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11510780	11518164	Mass Effect fans will get all butthurt because the rumor about the DLC proving indoctrination theory is true.
11521366	11524288	So DLC indoctrination is true.
11524659	11524899	Yeah.
11525839	11528060	And of course, you know, all the fans will get butt hurt.
11528360	11529580	I'll probably be a bit butt hurt.
11529700	11535121	For those that are not tapped into the fandom, briefly described what the indoctrination theory is.
11535441	11536881	Can you do that without spoiling the ending?
11537841	11538861	Not much.
11539502	11546323	Basically, okay, there's this thing where there's like a kind of mind control in the game for people who've been around Reaper technology a lot and the Reapers are the big bad guys.
11547183	11551944	And basically, they can kind of make you do whatever they want you to and think whatever they want you to think.
11552344	11553984	So maybe the whole ending was hallucinated.
11556701	11557101	Fair enough.
11559023	11562445	Alright, let's move on to Loki, your number two answer.
11564226	11567989	Bandit 2 will flop and the only good thing you'll get from it is fanfic.
11570771	11573133	Well, didn't I just hear that?
11577256	11581558	and because of the Wii U. And you think you had trouble with niche games on the Wii?
11581758	11583078	You haven't seen anything yet.
11583679	11587760	Alright, so Flaco Jones, what is your number to answer?
11588360	11599085	The next generation Xbox, the Lube, will be $100 if you sign up for a two year cell phone style commitment and pay a higher tier of Xbox Live, say like $15 a month.
11600946	11605989	That answer, I hate that answer because it is so probably true.
11606229	11611072	Like, oh my god, I hate you for saying that because I could see that happening.
11611933	11614274	So you're basically saying Xbox Lube goes the way of the iPhone.
11614314	11618537	It's just $99.99 with a two-year commitment to Xbox Live.
11619097	11620618	Platinum tier.
11620658	11622139	Platinum tier, exactly what I was thinking.
11622559	11623360	Oh, you dick.
11623600	11623920	All right.
11626042	11627763	Alan, your number two answer.
11629747	11634619	Watch Dogs and Bioshock Infinite will destroy everyone else's asshole as far as gaming of the year lists.
11636444	11638789	The only two games that everyone loses their mind over.
11640563	11642924	Final Fantasy XIV Reborn Not Bad Final Fantasy XIV Reborn
11672870	11673470	You know what?
11674130	11674971	That one's not fair.
11676051	11676351	Why?
11676811	11677551	I can't say why.
11678652	11680072	Well, it's a prediction.
11680132	11687054	Final Fantasy XIV Reborn turns out to not be that bad and it's the first time they've ever reversed course on an MMO and it works.
11688094	11688494	We'll see.
11689335	11694236	Alright, so so far we have Reggie reveals he's actually Donkey Kong.
11694576	11696257	Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.
11696697	11698697	Vita ports made by the same developers.
11699117	11700858	Devil May Cry reboot flops.
11701298	11725275	Vita price drop before the one year anniversary indoctrination DLC ending but hurts Mass Effect fans Bayonetta 2 will flop but yay fanfic the Xbox Lube is $100 with a commitment Watch Dogs and Bioshocks blows up game of the year lists and other things Final Fantasy 14 Reborn not bad gif alright so now we get down to the number one answers DarkSakura
11726263	11732229	Compile will rise from the ashes, not as Compile Heart, and bring us a new Guardic game.
11733771	11736954	As in, Guardic Gaiden was the Guardian Legend.
11737535	11738877	One of these years, I'd like you to be right.
11739217	11739537	All right.
11741179	11742280	Loki, your number one answer.
11742741	11743722	The Wii is gonna flop.
11745362	11748803	And the reason I say that is because they're not going to have any good games coming out.
11749004	11750544	And I'm not talking about Pikmin.
11750804	11753646	Yeah, some people like Pikmin, but Pikmin does not fucking sell systems.
11754926	11759568	I'm talking about Mario, Zelda, not until fourth quarter 2013.
11759988	11763210	And so basically you're going to have a big nine month dead period.
11764250	11768872	At least more than nine months where it's just going to dip down to nothing because...
11769352	11772013	It's not selling like hotcakes now.
11772893	11773493	Don't get me wrong.
11773513	11775474	They've got lots of systems out there right now.
11777834	11782556	We don't know how many systems they have out there, but they're not selling out.
11783196	11785477	And that's not good to not be selling out right now.
11786217	11789218	Granted, I know their supply is a little bit better, but it's not that much better.
11789878	11790818	You just popped in my head.
11791538	11793399	Flippity-floppity Wii U is on its way.
11795441	11798762	Flaco Jones, your number one prediction for 2013.
11799163	11805005	Skyward Sword will be ported to the Wii U replacing the innovative motion control with innovative touch control.
11806586	11810788	When you're talking about motion control, they're just going to do motion control with the gamepad.
11810828	11813629	It'll be the exact fucking thing again.
11814649	11815930	You have to use the screen.
11816150	11818191	Skyward Sword to the Wii U with touch control.
11818231	11819952	It's new control Skyward Sword.
11820232	11820452	Yes.
11820752	11821552	Alright, fair enough.
11822313	11824554	Alan, your number one answer.
11825643	11854371	Bioware will continue to support Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with DLC and weekend events through at least June I would like that to be true Alright, from a true fanboy I would still get my regular updates through June Alright, and my number one answer the last one for the list before we do the elimination rounds No PlayStation 4
11857750	11859711	I think everybody's expecting it to happen.
11860111	11860912	I don't think it will.
11861252	11862672	That's a very serious reply.
11862872	11864233	I think the new Xbox will happen.
11864393	11868174	I don't think Sony needs to recover on the Vita right now.
11868394	11870835	I don't think they're under any pressure to get the PlayStation 4 out.
11872116	11874497	Try to learn from the Wii U and the Xbox launches.
11874697	11876798	I think it's the smart thing to wait if you're Sony.
11877758	11878298	But we'll see.
11878618	11879939	I say no PlayStation 4 in 2013.
11881565	11882746	Alright, so there it is.
11882766	11885789	15 things on the damn list right now.
11886449	11902203	Reggie as Donkey Kong, Final Fantasy XI goes free to play, Vita ports made by the same developers as PS3, Devil May Cry reboot flops, Vita price drop before the one year anniversary, DLC indoctrination ending butt hurts Mass Effect fans, Bayonetta 2 flops, but fanfic.
11902583	11926494	The Xbox Lube is $100 with a commitment Watch Dogs and Bioshock Game of the Year list Final Fantasy Reborn, not bad, JPG Compile will rise from the ashes with a new Guarded game Wii U will flop Skyward Sword goes to Wii U with touch control Mass Effect multiplayer through June and no PlayStation 4 Now we get to the very tough part of the round
11932296	11935840	Alright, that's actually not the music I would have used.
11936761	11939244	Some of these YouTubes are labeled very strangely.
11939545	11942208	Let's do this theme song here.
11942228	11943590	Let's turn this for the vote off.
11945151	11946033	Ah, much better.
11946053	11946854	That's it.
11949016	11950858	Alright, so here we are at Tribal Council.
11952970	11957953	Will you tell me about how Russell wronged you and how you're going to vote his ass out tonight?
11958013	11958913	Alright, for real.
11959533	11960034	Here we go.
11960234	11963135	Going around and eliminating items that are not worthy of the list.
11963175	11967457	Remember, if two of a person's items get eliminated, the third answer becomes immune.
11967998	11972480	So, DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
11974941	11975661	Sorry, Alan.
11975741	11982585	I'm going to take out the Devil May Cry reboot because there is such a huge fanbase that it will make its money back just from fanbase alone.
11983736	11984797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12001730	12003130	Dante's pretty hot, don't get me wrong.
12003511	12004831	All right, who is next?
12004891	12006752	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
12008952	12014734	I'm going to have to say Compile.
12016174	12016755	It's not going to happen.
12016775	12017535	We've got to be real here.
12018515	12020476	All right, Compile, Rising from the Ashes.
12020636	12021476	It just ain't happening.
12022116	12024937	It's a wonderful pipe dream, but it's just not going to happen.
12025293	12026213	Alright, fair enough.
12027074	12029695	Then we will go to Flacco.
12029735	12031415	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
12031855	12034116	I can't decide because they're all going to happen.
12035476	12039698	I guess I'll just have to give DarkSakura immunity and say Indoctrination.
12040218	12041879	You're going to take Indoctrination off the list?
12042259	12050662	You're going to give Reggie is actually a shaved Donkey Kong immunity because I'm a little... There's something about that answer that worries me a little bit.
12051202	12052242	I don't want to go there.
12052482	12053503	Other people agree with me.
12053643	12053863	But...
12056311	12057552	He looks like a gorilla!
12058994	12062156	I really want to just get that answer off the list.
12062216	12064498	I don't want to give an immunity, so Flaco, I'm going to really tell you.
12064518	12065579	I changed my answer.
12065679	12066179	Thank you.
12066860	12067760	So you're changing your answer too?
12067780	12068181	Reggie!
12068621	12071684	Alright, that's a good one.
12071704	12072764	More Mass Effect!
12073165	12074246	Mass Effect gets immunity.
12074306	12075947	So Mass Effect gets immunity.
12076007	12076427	There we go.
12076467	12078509	I should have added that, you know, what was it?
12079430	12081151	Who is it that they always have during those...
12082652	12084013	Oh, it's Iwata.
12084313	12091239	Iwata's gonna be holding like a human head the next Nintendo conference thing that they do because he's always holding something weird like a banana or some weird shit.
12092239	12096883	Okay, there's a universe of difference between a banana and a head.
12097143	12097964	Maybe a shrunken head.
12098064	12099044	Yeah, but it's weird though.
12099084	12099865	He's just like bananas.
12099885	12100526	Think of it this way, Flaco.
12105281	12108644	Mass Effect fans getting butt hurt by something, that's a given.
12108684	12110425	That will happen.
12110545	12111946	I don't know if you should eliminate it.
12112906	12113807	Anyhow, let's go to Alan.
12113827	12115128	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
12120565	12128574	Generally, whenever I eliminate something, the chatroom hates me, so I'm really going to try and keep the more controversial ones up and get rid of the more normal ones.
12129996	12136403	I'm going to take off Final Fantasy XIV Reborn isn't bad.
12137244	12139426	Maybe, perhaps, of some bias.
12139546	12139887	I don't know.
12143365	12144246	You think it will be bad.
12144526	12145346	Alright, that's fair, that's fair.
12145366	12145606	Alright.
12146287	12146607	Uh, what?
12146627	12149249	I was gonna say, it's some bias of the person who said that statement.
12150729	12151030	Alright.
12151790	12153051	Uh, then that leaves me.
12153171	12154812	So which of Alan's answers should I get rid of?
12154872	12155012	No.
12155352	12158354	Uh, alright, so my turn to figure out which of these is not worthy of the list.
12158734	12162957	Um... Um... Oh, did you not get rid of one, Matt?
12163217	12163477	I did.
12163597	12164117	You did, right?
12164197	12164518	Oh, okay.
12165178	12171081	Uh, I'm gonna get rid of, um... I don't know.
12171622	12171702	Uh...
12172796	12173676	are all going to happen.
12173816	12174757	They're all going to happen.
12174797	12175437	They really are.
12176617	12180999	Okay, I'm going to get rid of Vita ports are made by the same developers because that's not going to happen.
12181519	12182520	Yeah, it's never going to happen.
12182540	12183600	That's never going to happen.
12183680	12184080	That's true.
12184120	12185741	It would happen if they actually wanted to save the Vita.
12185841	12186141	All right.
12186161	12190923	Yeah, if they really wanted to save the Vita, maybe, but no, that's not what's going to happen.
12190963	12191163	All right.
12191483	12193584	So here's the ones you can actually vote on.
12193644	12196505	We have Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.
12196905	12199445	Vita price drop before the one year anniversary.
12199826	12203107	DLC indoctrination ending but hurts Mass Effect fans.
12203387	12204787	I kind of butchered the grammar there, sorry.
12205247	12207108	Bayonetta 2 will flop, but fanfic.
12207648	12236187	The Xbox Lube is $100 with commitment Watch Dogs and Bioshear Trample Game of the Year list Wii U will flop Skyward Sword goes to Wii U with touch control Mass Effect Multiplayer through June which that's the one I really should have got rid of oh well and no PlayStation 4 so there it is you guys can place your vote now send your private message to Rob Roberts in the chat room with your number one and your number two answers for which of those you think will be the case
12236747	12239731	and we will tally up the results and get to that at the end of the show.
12241073	12241354	Alright.
12242495	12243497	Thanks for playing, guys.
12247253	12248794	Here's your immunity idol for playing.
12248994	12249294	Alright.
12250134	12250574	For life.
12250794	12252075	It's your immunity idol for life.
12252535	12253075	For life.
12253375	12255056	Was she the only one that got an immunity idol?
12256076	12257617	Yeah, she's the only one that got an immunity idol.
12257757	12258257	This time.
12260038	12262579	I think I should have a queen hat.
12264459	12265080	Or chocolate.
12266700	12268241	Okay, Alan, sit on Jamie's head.
12268921	12270022	Alright.
12270682	12271602	Alan's too tall.
12274542	12277023	All right, what does that leave for the segments here?
12277183	12278384	Oh, we've got to do this.
12278804	12291390	We have to do a very anticipated moment here in 2012 because remember when the power went out during the last show that Flaco Jones was on, his segment got cut and he never got to do it.
12291450	12296933	And literally he was in the middle of the segment talking about it like this and then he's like sad because the power.
12296953	12297913	What happened?
12297953	12298994	Why is it dark?
12299014	12299654	Why is it dark?
12300094	12303377	All right, so we are going to allow Flaco Jones tonight.
12303437	12305498	Yes, we're going to do two of these segments this week.
12305779	12309341	We're going to allow him to do his makeup classic game of the week tonight.
12309401	12317147	So making up for the show that was lost in May, Flaco Jones, what is your classic game of the week?
12317168	12322712	My classic game of last May is Chrono Cross.
12322972	12324113	Yay.
12324153	12324713	Good pick.
12325714	12326615	Really good opening theme.
12327421	12328301	Amazing music.
12328381	12331223	I have to find, actually, a Chrono Cross video.
12331243	12333523	There was one song in there that I really liked.
12333563	12335664	The girl who stole the stars.
12335684	12337365	The girl who stole the stars.
12337385	12338065	Yeah, yeah.
12338125	12339826	And it was an S word, and I was like, stole?
12339866	12340226	Yeah.
12340566	12341827	Is that the ending title theme?
12342947	12343527	I don't remember.
12343547	12347249	I just know that it's a piece I really like from that game.
12347329	12348529	My wife got me the soundtrack.
12348709	12349530	Last Christmas.
12349650	12350670	It's amazing.
12352851	12355952	Well, here you go, so you can all enjoy Christmas.
12357811	12358412	Yay!
12358953	12361478	Hell, come on.
12362059	12363040	One of the best parts.
12363621	12365544	The many best parts of the game, if that makes sense.
12366327	12370009	Made by Square in 1999 for Japan and 2000 for North America.
12370429	12377954	It's technically the third game in the Chrono series, followed by Chrono Trigger in 1995 and the Japanese-only text-based game Radical Dreamers in 1996.
12378394	12381936	It's set 20 years after the events in Chrono Trigger.
12382736	12387919	The game focuses on Surge, this kid who stumbles into an alternate dimension where he died 10 years earlier.
12388319	12392542	It created a schism in the timeline that was saved by your party in Chrono Trigger.
12393482	12402824	He teams up with a mysterious thief named Kid on a mission to stop a demi-human named Lynx who is trying to use Surge's displacement in time for his own evil purposes.
12403584	12408785	So as you play through the game, one of the coolest parts is you get to have a lot of people in your party.
12408825	12415526	Now, it's only like the typical three-person party, but you can recruit up to 45 people and swap them in and out pretty much however you please.
12416206	12418927	And they all have different, you know, base powers and things like that.
12420247	12425529	But the only way to obtain all 45 of those characters is to play through the game three times.
12425589	12428471	And I beat this game five times, so I've gotten all the characters.
12429911	12433153	A lot of them have their own unique little dialogue quirks.
12433593	12441016	To do this, they coded a script generator to change the standard dialogue for all these special characters so they wouldn't have to rewrite and translate for all the different ones.
12441856	12442156	Outro Music
12470042	12472043	See, they also built the battle system from the ground up.
12472083	12481386	It doesn't use magic points, because as you attack, you use stamina points, and with each successful attack, you gain access to higher-tiered elements on your elemental grid.
12481987	12492791	Each element is tied to a color that affects the field of battle, and those are tied to basic elements like fire and water, nature, earth, and something else.
12494091	12494652	Let's see.
12495472	12506840	Based on how you manipulate the field, you can do more damage, and that's kind of received some flack for the game because it is easy in that sense, along with the whole grind-free aspect of it.
12507400	12514966	The combat system is pretty easy to figure out, and once you do, and you can just manipulate the field, you can own stuff super fast in this game.
12515886	12520170	Let's see, it received extremely well by critics.
12520990	12525474	It had a perfect 10 on GameSpot, 36 out of 40 on Famitsu, and 97 on IGN.
12527015	12530838	The game shipped over a million and a half copies and was re-released as a Greatest Hits version.
12531557	12535561	It does have plenty of detractors, with the most common complaint being it isn't Chrono Trigger 2.
12535641	12549793	The game's creators never intended it to be a true sequel to Chrono Trigger, as they wanted to build a new game from the ground up for this new platform, PlayStation 1, not new at that point, but new compared to Chrono Trigger.
12549813	12554837	They didn't want to just have another game that looked like Chrono Trigger playing on the PlayStation.
12556058	12558940	Well, plus there was such a difference between Final Fantasy 6 and 7.
12559020	12559741	Yeah, exactly.
12559761	12561602	Chrono made a very similar kind of jump.
12562842	12569566	And the game, I think, also pissed off a lot of fans because as you play the game, you realize some characters from Chrono Trigger died.
12569586	12575090	So you're like, oh, so that means there probably can never be a true Chrono Trigger 2 because this person's dead.
12575150	12576771	But, you know, it's time travel, so you never know.
12576871	12579312	Chrono Trigger could come back maybe someday.
12579332	12580333	They could do whatever they want.
12580353	12581373	They could do whatever they want.
12581473	12583815	It's time travel, and it's magic, and who cares?
12584575	12601500	it's still a great game let's see oh yeah okay and then this is what I was going to end on was the music is the best nobody can really complain about that it's my favorite part of the game and I got the soundtrack like I said the highlights are Time Scar and I love Magical Dreamers I love the end credits song
12602260	12620554	and uh yeah just a kind of game you can just sit and listen to the music to if you you can just leave it on that menu screen and just let it go and that's just time scar over and over and over attract mode you know on Chrono Trigger I used to let it sit in um Zeal and just play that music over and over again and Shala's music
12621972	12630149	I love that they kept just that awesome, the musical style was, it kept the same style at least.
12630570	12632434	And she plays a big role in Chrono Cross.
12633393	12635734	You know, I never got that far into it.
12636294	12637194	You know what, though?
12637554	12638234	I've got the game.
12638254	12639395	It's another critique of the game.
12640555	12650738	It's almost like they could have changed one little thing about a certain character in Chrono Cross, and I think it would have made a huge difference to maybe fans of Chrono Trigger and the shawls.
12651278	12652218	But I guess you've got to play it.
12652678	12655859	I'm not going to spoil it, even though this game is like 12 years old or whatever.
12656579	12656999	All right.
12657239	12658960	Well, there it is, your classic game of the May.
12659340	12660040	Classic game of the May.
12660360	12661280	Chrono Cross.
12661360	12662040	Thank you for watching.
12662060	12665141	I'm glad you finally got to give the game its due here on the show.
12665161	12666401	I love this game.
12666581	12666881	I know.
12666921	12669622	We all know that you love the game.
12669662	12671122	We're going to open up the Skype line.
12671202	12673802	We don't have a whole lot of time for calls tonight because we're running very long.
12673842	12675383	It's damn near a four-hour show tonight.
12675463	12681504	So 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Launch Radio, all one word, if you want to give us a call.
12682104	12683384	And we will take some of your calls.
12683504	12685345	We will do the listless results here shortly.
12685405	12686245	I just wanted to give it one.
12686545	12689830	or a minute for votes because we have a massive tie going on right now.
12689890	12692874	So I just wanted to see if that tie would get broken, but it doesn't look likely at this point.
12693795	12694316	So we'll see.
12694617	12700344	I'm also going to do tweets real quick here at twitter.com slash OLR, but I need my iPad for that.
12700385	12702127	So Loki, do you have any last minute story?
12702187	12702988	Probably not, huh?
12703128	12703429	No, I do.
12704821	12705222	I won.
12705802	12706624	Oh, Rob, see?
12706944	12708827	This is kind of sad, actually.
12709207	12719040	You may remember the last few years we haven't had a new NBA game, NBA Elite, well, NBA EA NBA game, like NBA Live or NBA Elite or whatever you want to call it.
12719801	12728405	So NBA Live 10, the last NBA game released by EA, is going to have its online support shut down January 11th.
12729326	12733208	So if you're still playing NBA Live, you're done.
12733328	12736309	But go act really angry on the internet because apparently that works.
12736369	12737290	It worked with GameSpy.
12737770	12738250	You never know.
12738550	12739571	Alright, we have a call on the line.
12739631	12740171	Let's get to it.
12740211	12741272	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
12741312	12741652	Who's this?
12742213	12743033	Hello, it's Shane.
12743133	12744173	Hey, Shane, how you doing?
12744734	12745174	I'm good.
12745674	12748455	Did you like the Konami stories that Jim was telling us earlier?
12748555	12765079	There are so many other ones that are really funny that he missed, like the fact that there was the one guy when we were doing Karaoke Revolution that couldn't sing at all, and nobody could be in the same room with him while he tested because we would all laugh too hard, so we'd have to go other places.
12765799	12769700	Me and one of the guys had to go in the storage closet because we wanted to laugh so hard at it.
12771559	12772360	I forgot about that, yes.
12772380	12775802	There was a guy that was so bad at Karaoke Revolution it sent you back in the closet.
12776643	12776883	Yes.
12776903	12777903	Alright, amazing.
12777923	12779545	Alright, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?
12780785	12789291	One, you did not pick the right number one for your list list as I gave you a better number one that is probably more likely to happen than anything on the list list.
12789651	12790972	And what would that answer be?
12792053	12798938	Verbatim, I put your number one will be Shane will find a game he loves and gets Rob and Jamie to fall madly in love with it as well.
12801081	12802062	Only if it's more Mass Effect.
12803644	12805887	That's what you say now until I find something.
12805907	12807969	He's trying with Persona.
12808109	12808790	No, not yet.
12809030	12811814	I will not try yet until I beat it, but it will happen.
12812514	12812875	Whatever.
12813596	12814437	It's really, really good.
12814457	12815698	It's not worked with Skylanders.
12815878	12816599	I'm not doing that.
12816619	12818321	I'm not going to try to get you into Skylanders.
12819730	12820290	I promise.
12820891	12822812	I don't want to be into Skylanders.
12823372	12823793	All right.
12824313	12824893	But you are.
12824914	12838342	No, what I was really going to say is, and something I think we talked about before, is that when I was doing my own, like, what games did I love this year, my top five, four of them were Vita games, which seemed a little ridiculous to me.
12838983	12843986	So just because the system kind of sucks doesn't mean that the games are awful, too.
12844747	12845247	Let me guess.
12845287	12849310	That must be Luminous, Persona, Gravity Rush?
12849910	12850871	Nope.
12850891	12851792	I didn't beat the game yet.
12852953	12855055	Sound Shapes.
12855156	12858759	And DJ Max.
12860581	12861382	Yeah, I guess that's true.
12861482	12862683	Those are all still really great games.
12863564	12869450	And PlayStation Plus makes it easier because I got four games from PlayStation Plus now on there too that I can play and love.
12869750	12873552	This is the part of the year where all the websites are doing their best and worst of 2012.
12873932	12876453	And like Yahoo, I don't know why I read Yahoo, but I do.
12876913	12879535	They have their worst of 2012 in tech.
12879615	12881135	And the Vita inevitably made the list.
12881375	12883997	And there's a lot of websites where the Vita made the worst in tech list.
12884037	12886618	But yet we have the golden rule of gaming.
12886658	12888439	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
12888479	12891040	If the games are so good on the Vita, why is the Vita flopping?
12892552	12904655	The price sucks, and as, you know, Flaco Jones says, the first-party games that should be made by their actual devs are not, and so they're not as good.
12904935	12906095	With the exception of LittleBigPlanet.
12906115	12907876	I think that game's fun on Vita.
12907976	12908996	I really like it on Vita.
12909136	12912497	Yeah, LittleBigPlanet's good on Vita.
12912517	12913917	But, god, Uncharted.
12913997	12916978	They were still involved in some capacity, and I think that was important.
12917600	12921181	Uncharted feels like a bad cell phone knockoff of Uncharted.
12921562	12923762	It's terrible.
12924523	12928084	That was almost on my disappointing list, but I didn't really play enough of it to really say that.
12928564	12929265	You don't need to.
12929405	12937068	Just play like five minutes and then try to do one of the stupid rubbings or aiming in that game or climbing with the touchscreen.
12937108	12937948	That's terrible too.
12938188	12939449	We were talking about this earlier.
12939469	12942190	What would you say was your most disappointing of 2012?
12943502	12968442	um my game's Guild Wars 2 I just it was not as good as I was expecting with all the time and effort they put into it um I would even throw in Mists of Pandaria I have way too many issues with this game uh this expansion uh I will also say oh god what else did I tell you I told you Uncharted because I thought that was really bad both Uncharted Uncharted 3 or was that last year
12969284	12970365	I don't know, it wasn't good either.
12970405	12971485	Uncharted 3 was last year.
12971906	12977589	Okay, well, it's terribleness bled over into this year too.
12979390	12980130	You know what?
12980170	12988515	This is going to be terrible coming from me, but I'm slightly disappointed with the latest Pokemon game because it didn't hold my interest.
12988715	12989836	I haven't even beaten it yet.
12990928	12991268	Wow.
12991288	12992169	Now Pokemon.
12992329	12994071	I kind of can't believe that you would say that.
12994771	12995111	I know.
12995352	13003978	I only have five badges and there are like too many other games I'd rather play than Pokemon right now, which is very depressing to me.
13004419	13006941	Somebody put Pokemon White 2 as their game of the year.
13008182	13010443	Well, that's their wrong opinion.
13010604	13011004	It's cool.
13012385	13013926	How did I know you were going to say something like that?
13014587	13015568	Because I'm a jerk.
13015648	13017369	Well, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
13018611	13021934	Um, no, I don't think so.
13021954	13026118	I was trying to think of another funny Konami story before I got off the Skype.
13026278	13036646	But I, oh, one of the times where we went drinking at lunch, somebody in the room I sat in, they drank too much.
13036946	13038888	So they got sent home early.
13039088	13042251	And then as a sign of solidarity, I left early too.
13042271	13042511	Yeah.
13043971	13045372	Sign of Solidarity.
13045612	13049275	It also was on a Friday, so it wasn't that bad of an idea.
13050076	13050436	All right.
13050977	13051297	All right.
13052058	13052518	That's it.
13052578	13053399	I'm going to let you go.
13053499	13056361	You can tell more stories when you come to California and guest on the show again.
13057002	13057242	Okay.
13057362	13057622	All right.
13057722	13057982	Bye.
13058062	13058263	Bye.
13059504	13060765	We can probably fit in one more call.
13060785	13064007	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
13064027	13065589	Were you done with last minute stories, Loki?
13066289	13066649	Are you good?
13067450	13067910	I'm good.
13068110	13069111	All right.
13069271	13071792	Reading some of the tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
13072673	13077116	SSJ100Matt tweeted us saying, I won't be listening tonight because I will be seeing The Hobbit for my birthday.
13077436	13078236	Happy birthday, by the way.
13078276	13078797	Whoop-deesh.
13078917	13080618	No, I'm kidding.
13080838	13081318	Happy birthday.
13081498	13083500	I hope you like 10 minutes of dwarves singing.
13083560	13084060	No, I'm just kidding.
13084100	13084720	I haven't seen it yet.
13084760	13085261	I'm not going to hate.
13085981	13087882	But I would like to wish you all a happy new year.
13087922	13090324	Well, happy new year to you, too, and happy birthday.
13091885	13092165	Let's see.
13094026	13102531	Actdeft tweeted us wanting us to know that Austin Wintory of the Journey soundtrack fame released all his music on Bandcamp for Pay What You Want.
13103231	13105492	AustinWintory.Bandcamp.com.
13105512	13106253	That's pretty awesome.
13107253	13109735	And great soundtrack for Journey, by the way.
13110475	13114077	Also, I did want to say there is another game that is up on the top of my list.
13114998	13117519	It's Street Fighter X Mega Man.
13118263	13118663	Dirty Pair
13144318	13144858	That, too.
13144878	13148759	Do you know how much freaking anime I have sitting on my shelf I've bought over the years and yet to watch?
13151260	13153440	I just finished the first season of Sailor Moon.
13153460	13154320	What does that tell you?
13154880	13155200	Really?
13155280	13158361	I've watched, like, the whole run of it three times now.
13159681	13160242	In Japanese.
13161022	13164462	Just imagine how many people are going to be watching it right before the premiere of the new series.
13164943	13166543	I need to be on Anime Jam Session, dude.
13167648	13168529	It's going to happen.
13168930	13172415	Episode 100 is coming soon and we got some shit in store, you know?
13172736	13173317	Nice.
13174999	13175540	Very cool.
13175580	13177563	Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
13178562	13181564	Oh, the whole Shamestop debacle.
13182164	13183625	Oh, you're talking about the porn thing?
13185065	13185726	I'm sorry.
13185886	13192970	I have to laugh when Shamestop says they have standards and practices on their refurbished consoles.
13193350	13193990	I'm sorry.
13194270	13201914	How can you call it refurbished when I walk in and sell it and 10 minutes later someone comes in and buys what I just sold you?
13202054	13203415	That's not refurbished.
13204750	13208053	Standards and Practices is the firing department, let's be real.
13209754	13212136	Standards and Practices, human resource, the whole nine yards.
13212256	13214178	I mean, they don't really care.
13214278	13217521	I mean, I sold them my DS fat with a broken L button.
13217561	13218462	They didn't give a damn.
13221124	13226528	I should have sold them my broken iPhone, but I ended up giving that to my dad because he'll try to fix it, knowing him.
13227589	13231833	All they're going to do is turn it on, see if it powers up, that's it, done.
13233450	13233750	Wow.
13235011	13235511	Easy enough.
13236952	13237572	Exactly.
13237792	13241494	And this is why I try not to shop there unless I truly had to.
13241975	13245116	Last time I went there, I bought NCIS for my 3DS.
13245377	13249619	Come to find out, if I waited an extra day, I could have gotten it from Nintendo World for the same price.
13250800	13251100	Yikes.
13251700	13253701	What's been your favorite in gaming this year?
13254622	13262346	Well, like I said, it was Final Fantasy Theater Rhythm, but it was a toss-up between that and Mario Kart 7, because you know I love my Mario Kart.
13262881	13264002	Mario Kart's good times.
13264702	13267064	Yes, especially when we were playing during the breaks.
13267424	13268946	Rob, you've got to bring that back.
13269206	13272368	Especially at Anime Jam Session.
13272388	13278873	You probably play it on there too, but at Anime Conventions, I'm sure there's lots of breakouts of various DS titles and so forth.
13279588	13283150	Yeah, I mostly see it's Mario Kart or Tetris.
13283711	13285692	Right now, the big thing is Pokemon.
13285712	13287473	That's what everyone is doing.
13288174	13288694	Very cool.
13289875	13291296	What about disappointing games this year?
13291356	13293097	Is there anything you want to call out as disappointing?
13295459	13301463	Well, I didn't play a lot of games this year, but I don't think there was anything disappointing, but...
13302369	13303010	Assassin's Creed 3
13320663	13321043	Gotcha.
13322644	13322984	All right.
13323084	13326806	Well, we're going to let you go, but good luck with your show in 2013.
13327186	13328287	Good luck with Anime Jam Session.
13328307	13334669	I look forward to Episode 100 and when you guys inevitably go live at some point, right?
13336430	13343413	Well, I might as well say that's part of what we're working on for 100 because of all the extra equipment I've been buying over the last couple of weeks to get things going.
13343914	13344294	Nice.
13344374	13346235	So it sounds like we'll be chatting in the coming weeks.
13347120	13348082	Oh, you got that right.
13348262	13348763	All righty.
13349043	13349844	All right, take care, buddy.
13349884	13351367	Have a safe new year.
13352168	13354712	You too, and stay fabulous and don't get too drunk.
13354912	13355273	I will.
13355353	13355893	Stay black.
13357076	13357496	Bye buddy Bye
13381851	13390735	I heard the thing about John Woo directing the movie, but apparently he links us to a report on Kotaku via Twitter that says, yeah, it ain't happening.
13391275	13402580	An interview with the producer Brad Foxhoven, former producer in IGN, Nintendo surprisingly gave its blessing to the project, because obviously they didn't like Super Mario Bros.
13402620	13409663	at first, but they thought with John Woo it would be better, but I guess they couldn't do it, and a lot of it had to do with Samus' backstory.
13410143	13412144	that they wanted to explore making a movie about her.
13412204	13417847	But Nintendo, I guess, wanted to be the ones to answer those questions, not have it answered in a movie.
13418547	13419628	Let's go to one more call.
13419708	13421389	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
13421429	13421889	Who's this?
13422669	13423210	Hey, what's up?
13423270	13423870	It's Tiger Claw.
13424030	13426351	Hey, Tiger Claw, and it's video.
13426591	13430973	Just like, remember I said a couple weeks ago that I wanted to get more video calls?
13431234	13435436	And we even have the cam, which we need to get on the show, but maybe in 2013.
13435496	13437417	Well, how you do, Tiger Claw?
13438317	13439418	Oh, I'm doing fine.
13440159	13447486	Earlier in the show, you guys mentioned about the VOG Network leaderboard and stuff and how I'm still in the top on there.
13447686	13448807	That's right.
13448847	13452150	He's number one for the year if you look at overall score, I believe.
13452270	13452931	Is he really?
13453631	13454192	I think so.
13454412	13457054	I worry on Bobby Blackwolf telling me all that stuff.
13457094	13460438	But no, I wanted you to call in and talk some shit, and here you are.
13460458	13461318	This is great.
13461659	13463961	So are you here to trash talk Flaco Jones a little bit?
13465473	13472540	I just want to know is how has he managed to get first place because I don't know where he's getting all those extra points.
13473040	13477384	He's doing it because he gets a lot of people somehow to reply to his comments.
13477405	13479447	I do a lot of comments.
13480027	13483991	He does so many comments he gets people to like him and reply to him and I think that's how he's doing it.
13484271	13484952	That's how I do it.
13486473	13496278	He may have to change up his strategy in 2013 because there is going to be some, not so much changes, but we've been promising we're going to change up the game a little bit.
13496618	13498959	And so the game will be evolving in 2013.
13499339	13502520	The game has changed.
13502540	13503081	That's right.
13503141	13504321	The game has changed.
13505842	13507543	It sure definitely did.
13509400	13521750	But anyways, for anyone out there that wants to try to get their hands at the leaderboard, all you have to do is one simple thing is to basically go to the website every single day.
13522130	13523351	That is all.
13523671	13524592	Check in all the shows.
13525993	13527454	Check in all the shows.
13527494	13536577	Go to the site every day because there will be a day where you'll get a loot for actually visiting the site every day.
13537297	13538938	Don't go giving away all the games secret.
13539958	13540658	And all that stuff.
13541359	13543820	It's a good thing you're revamping the game.
13543960	13545920	It's a good thing the game's shifting in a little bit.
13545940	13547801	We've already said all the strategies tonight.
13548781	13551402	And also, please like people's comments.
13555564	13561166	If someone writes a comment saying that it was a good show, whatever, you should like it.
13563266	13567828	If there's something positive about your show, I think it deserves a like.
13570003	13570904	New Ways to Play
13588177	13595644	And hopefully in the future, which I know you guys are probably planning, maybe you'll get loot for posting in forums or something like that.
13596144	13596805	You never know.
13596845	13600168	We don't want to encourage post-touring, but we do want to encourage participation.
13601389	13601889	You never know.
13601929	13602950	You never know what might happen with that.
13603231	13614681	But since you kind of brought up the whole VOG thing and all that, I did at some point, since it is the last live show of the year and so forth, there were a lot of changes this year, obviously, that they could have gone...
13615201	13642099	many different ways and you guys really kind of embraced this whole VOG idea which in many ways was fucking insane to be doing but so many of you guys have just embraced it and like you and Flaco both just kind of you know running with the game and not just you guys you know like Actdeft, Immortal King all those guys you see they're just hopping the leaderboards and everybody has been participating it's just been so fun and we can't wait to just kind of like continue on that for 2013 and I really want to thank
13642979	13647301	Everybody that's kind of jumped on board with VOG in the hosting community as well.
13647641	13659667	Brad from PodCulture, John from Critical Myth, Brian from British Invaders, Travis and Jess from Understation Live, Rama from Anime Jam Session, Syl from Girls Gone Wild, myself twice.
13660347	13664388	But I really want to thank just everybody who's really jumped on board with all the other shows.
13664488	13666709	And we're hoping to expand the lineup even more in 2013.
13666749	13668549	And just everybody who's been really excited about this.
13668569	13669510	We want to do more video.
13670010	13671590	There's so much more we want to do.
13672010	13675351	And we're just hoping we can get the resources to do it.
13675371	13680413	Speaking of the live video stuff, you've been recently broadcasting some live gameplay.
13680993	13681453	That's a thing.
13681473	13682493	That's a new thing we want to do.
13682553	13684594	It's a great way to promote and so forth.
13684614	13684774	Yeah.
13685736	13688623	If I remember, Rob, didn't you get XCOM?
13688683	13690567	I don't know if you got it for PC or something.
13691781	13693362	I did play it on PlayStation 3.
13693722	13695803	I played it the week we didn't have a show.
13696883	13701564	I didn't play really a lot of it because I kind of decided it was something I wasn't super into.
13701604	13703705	I'm so bad at tactical games.
13704325	13704725	I don't know.
13705706	13707626	Also, it just kind of made me want the old ones again.
13707666	13709407	I was like, I don't want all this newfangled stuff.
13709427	13710948	Just give me the old XCOM games.
13711168	13714989	Next time you play it, you should name all the soldiers after people you know.
13716770	13720111	And then at some point when they die, you start feeling bad about it.
13720131	13722691	Oh, DarkSakura just got shot in the face by an alien.
13722711	13723331	What am I going to do?
13723351	13723872	What am I going to do?
13723892	13724852	Dying of dysentery.
13726512	13729193	It is kind of the new version of somebody dying of dysentery.
13729453	13730373	I'm getting a look.
13730433	13733353	This is why it's too bad we don't have the video yet, but soon.
13733854	13735054	Hey, two words.
13735234	13735474	What?
13735754	13736414	Bite me.
13736594	13736954	All right.
13737614	13743295	Tigerclaw, I should probably let you go so we can wrap up everything, but I do want to thank you for your support with VOG and everything this year.
13743376	13745616	And do you have anything else you want to get out before we wrap up the show?
13746357	13749040	Well, I would like to wish you all a happy new year.
13749461	13749942	Same to you.
13749962	13754548	And just hoping for bigger and better things for VOG Network in 2013.
13754688	13756711	It's already awesome.
13756811	13757652	No, yes, of course.
13758453	13759695	Bigger and better is always good.
13759735	13761637	Yes, we were striving for more in 2013.
13763604	13766485	Alright, guys, so I guess I'll see you later.
13766765	13767945	Alright, take care, buddy.
13768145	13769505	Have a safe new year.
13770285	13771085	Alright, you too.
13771245	13771865	Alright, bye-bye.
13772666	13772866	Bye.
13773926	13776326	That's a great way to close out the show, I think, tonight.
13776466	13777826	Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.
13777947	13779387	I do see the skyline still lighting up.
13779427	13780687	Please consider sending an email.
13781247	13783087	Give DarkSakura tons of shit to read next week.
13783727	13788748	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com He's killing you and then making you work.
13788948	13792009	Before, I know, first I got an alien to shoot you in the face.
13792109	13792289	Alright.
13792964	13794149	Rob, you're being a ho-bag.
13794329	13795152	I am being a ho-bag.
13795232	13798945	Alright, before we wrap up the show, we have to reveal who won Listless!
13805154	13809317	Here it is, the top four as voted on you, the listeners.
13809677	13815681	This is a crazy situation, but we have a top four tonight because we have a three-way tie for second place.
13816622	13820664	So here it is, the three answers you voted in second place tonight.
13821365	13823706	Final Fantasy XI goes free-to-play.
13825628	13826749	Lots of fans of free stuff.
13828149	13831410	A Vita price drop before the one year anniversary.
13832390	13833711	Again, fans of cheap things.
13834731	13844354	And I don't know what this says about cheap, but also tying for second place tonight, the Xbox Lube is $100 with a commitment and the Platinum Live program.
13845074	13845574	So there it is.
13845614	13847214	They're all money related things.
13847654	13849475	But the number one answer is...
13849795	13854997	for 2013 predictions as voted by you, the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.
13855857	13856797	No PlayStation 4.
13857898	13858538	There it is.
13860418	13861059	It is done.
13861179	13862699	Sign it, seal it, deliver it.
13862759	13865180	Tell Sony, wait and make it better.
13866381	13867162	Don't rush it.
13867322	13868123	Don't pull a Vita.
13868163	13868984	Don't pull a Vita.
13870605	13870966	All right.
13871706	13873148	Games, games, games.
13873188	13875530	Developers, developers, developers.
13875590	13875931	Wait a minute.
13875951	13876411	Wrong show.
13876431	13876672	Sorry.
13877212	13877512	All right.
13878073	13883619	That is really going to wrap it up for us tonight, but not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
13884700	13909477	I want to thank Alan for being on the show tonight he's in the other room if he runs in here by chance I'll let him say something but Flaco I'm so happy you made it through a full show and not just that but probably our two shows might be our longest show of the year I know right well we had to make up for not being here last week but thank you I know you have to stay up late and you've got kids and you had drove an hour to get here so at least I don't have to work tomorrow there you go so seriously thank you for being here and come back again when you can
13910577	13911158	I'll try.
13911258	13911658	I'll try.
13911698	13912339	I love being here.
13912519	13914401	And thanks for being so enthusiastic about the network.
13914461	13914982	Like, for real.
13915002	13915702	Like, it means a lot.
13915882	13917904	I think I live on the website.
13918825	13920146	That's what we want people to do.
13920166	13921848	It's great talking to everybody on there.
13921868	13922709	We need Lil Flacos.
13924210	13925151	Flaco clones.
13925451	13926872	Actually, we have some other people to do, too.
13926912	13928174	Obviously, we just talked to Tiger Claw.
13928194	13929535	He's pretty good about that, too.
13931176	13933158	Anyway, in all seriousness, have a great new year.
13933298	13934940	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
13937524	13938944	Watch Community when it comes back.
13939004	13939884	It's my favorite show.
13940484	13941945	Your shirt is great, by the way.
13941985	13943565	The 8-bit style shirt.
13943585	13944525	Where did you get that?
13944926	13949487	It's from the NBC website because it's an episode of Community.
13949507	13950647	They're all in an 8-bit game.
13950667	13952988	It's a journey to the center of Hawthorne.
13953048	13955228	But they need to just chop Chevy Chase out.
13955328	13957169	Well, he already left the show.
13957189	13957929	That's the best thing.
13957969	13960690	Watch this season because you realize at the end he's going to leave the show.
13961570	13962930	The worst part of the show is going to be gone.
13962950	13964131	Of course, it's probably going to get canceled too.
13964411	13964611	Don't.
13965271	13965571	All right.
13965971	13966712	It's the last season.
13966752	13967572	It's running, by the way.
13969332	13970753	No, it wasn't planned last season.
13971113	13972473	No, it was this.
13972633	13974914	The Office and Parks and Rec, I think, are the last season.
13975214	13975914	No, not yet.
13976015	13976655	It's not official.
13977355	13979356	It's over, but it's not official.
13979376	13980296	It's 30 Rock.
13980556	13982377	Yeah, 30 Rock is the one that's on its last season.
13982397	13986318	But, yeah, they're going to run their Christmas show in, like, March or something.
13986358	13987278	It's going to be bad.
13987578	13988318	But I still love it.
13989839	13992860	Why is a cynic vampire saying, yay, community, Annie's boobs?
13993360	13994020	Annie's boobs.
13994721	13995601	Hashtag Annie's boobs.
13995661	13999804	I thought he was talking about your wife and I was going to be a little defensive for you because you left chat.
13999864	14002745	Annie's boobs is the name of a monkey on community.
14002785	14004166	Don't talk about his wife's boobs like that.
14004266	14004526	All right.
14005287	14005607	Anyhow.
14005787	14006507	Got to watch the show.
14006687	14007208	Got to watch the show.
14007228	14008168	Boobs are monkeys.
14008328	14009449	What?
14009669	14011710	You guys are all lost because you need to watch this.
14012050	14012911	No, I don't watch Lost.
14014592	14017013	If Reggie looks like a monkey, then he looks like boobs.
14019031	14023076	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
14023096	14023978	Monkeys.
14034153	14040697	My final thought tonight is, as I always say, help us spread the word about our show, about VOG.
14041157	14044079	Word of mouth is all we got, so tell a friend about what you heard here.
14044399	14047361	Thank you to everybody who has helped make this year a success.
14047401	14049622	Thank you to everybody who supported us through big changes.
14049983	14058228	Thank you to everybody who's continued to support us, supported other projects, supported other indie shows, even if it's not even a VOG show, if it's just an indie show.
14058288	14059889	Thank you for supporting podcasting.
14060109	14062930	Because some people try to say podcasting is dead, and to that I say...
14064071	14064552	Hell no.
14065413	14067856	As long as there is a microphone and a computer, podcasting will live on.
14067876	14068717	How come nobody told me that?
14068917	14069197	I know.
14069257	14070038	I didn't get the memo.
14070799	14073342	So we'll be back to do it all again next year.
14074503	14076165	Episode 500 next year, you guys.
14076385	14084535	And maybe, by slim margins, although it's not too likely, but maybe you'll win the podcast awards.
14085080	14090981	Oh yeah, that's coming up soon too, but we didn't buy a ticket to the ceremony, so we're probably not going to win.
14091281	14093622	It's good to be nominated.
14094062	14095502	It's great to be nominated.
14095522	14096543	It feels really good.
14097103	14098163	I meant it to win it!
14098843	14103144	So buying a ticket gets you how many more podcast award points to get there?
14103404	14105364	I'm not going to shade the whole thing.
14106285	14106805	It is what it is.
14108366	14112993	As long as an indie podcast wins, I will be happy, and I'm pretty sure one is going to win.
14113534	14114195	I'm in it to win it.
14114455	14115136	All right, that's it.
14115196	14115577	We're done.
14115617	14115937	We're out.
14115977	14116298	Good night.
