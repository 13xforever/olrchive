00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, December 30th, 2012, one console

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,760
ends production.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,660
Could adult movies really soon be on the Wii U?

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:31,820
Can we look back at the best and worst of 2012?

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,900
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,940
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:47,280
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 487 for this December the 30th of 2012.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,480
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,840
video games, video gaming, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, gamer, we haven't

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,780
thought of it yet, with my co-hosts.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,240
Say hello to DarkSakura.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Hi.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,000
How are you DarkSakura?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Caffeinated.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,520
Or Jamie Summers, depending on how people want to call you.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Or awesome.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,560
Or awesome, Miss Awesome, Queen of Awesome.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Yes, that's right.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,440
You excited for New Year's Eve?

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
I guess.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Big plans?

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
No.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,160
Okay, Dan's gonna have the relatives over and my plan is to be playing Mass Effect from

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,440
the New Year rolls in and drinking, which are my two resolutions.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,200
I was just gonna say, you made a Facebook post the other day with your New Year's resolutions.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,320
My New Year's resolutions, actually I had four things.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,080
I think it was to drink more, to play more Mass Effect, to play more WoW, which actually

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,600
I have been slacking, and to do more art.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,020
Usually you don't see people resolve to play more video games, you see people resolve to

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
play less.

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
I need to play more video games.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,020
I've been slacking.

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
You need to play more variety of video games.

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,840
I need to play more games that I've actually bought on Steam.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
There you go.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,840
I just bought Limbo, because it's on sale and it looks really neat.

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Who doesn't love a sale?

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,240
I've been getting really kind of artsy fartsy games and then I went out and bought Dr. Robotnik's

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
Mean Bean Machine.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Why not?

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
So, more on that later.

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,720
You mean Kirby's Avalanche?

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,560
No, puyo puyo.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Hi.

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
How are you, Loki?

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm doing alright.

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Yeah?

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Yeah.

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
What's new with you?

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Not much.

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,720
I mean, just watching a video of Grand Theft Auto.

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,240
Even when you're not playing it, you're thinking about it.

54
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
It's cool.

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
Yeah, I am.

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,520
I noticed that you brought pizza with you to the show tonight.

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,960
The last OLR of 2012, by the way.

58
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,480
Actually the last live VoG network show of 2012.

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,600
Not the last VoG show of 2012, because we do have taped programming tomorrow, but the

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,880
last live show of 2012 tonight.

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,560
So you brought pizza and you said it's Pepperoni 4.0?

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,220
They call it, it's Round Table's Pepperoni 4.0.

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,640
It's not very good, because they're like, oh hey, we're gonna put a bunch of pepperoni

64
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
on there.

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,780
Yeah, I thought it'd be a lot of pepperoni, but it's just like, really the thing that

66
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,420
ruins it is their primo pepperoni.

67
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,420
It's the one that's like, it looks like salami, and it kind of tastes like salami.

68
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Maybe it is salami.

69
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,780
It's not salami, but it tastes sort of, it's either saltier and spicier, and it just kind

70
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
of tastes off.

71
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,380
The rest of them taste pretty good.

72
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,060
But they have like these, I don't know, it's almost like the full currency of pepperonis.

73
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,260
They have the salami shaped pepperonis, they have the smaller, regular sized pepperonis,

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,220
they have the pepperonis you would find at like, was it Papa Murphy's or whatever, or

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,220
uh...

76
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,540
Honestly, Loki, I look at that and I go, I want a veggie.

77
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,380
And then they have tiny pepperonis that are like, the size of, I don't know what.

78
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,860
It's just super tiny.

79
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,740
We're always joined by the fourth guest on our show, the chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

80
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,180
where we do tape live every Sunday night, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

81
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,740
But not tonight, he was off.

82
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,940
He plays in the drum line for the Atlanta Falcons, and they had the late game today.

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,800
So he was off tonight.

84
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,820
But we do have the chatters with us tonight.

85
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,820
Frisbee starts us off tonight on Loki's Pizza, saying it's pep for Roni.

86
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Alright.

87
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,860
Well, we do have another guest with us tonight live in studio, a makeup visit, if you will.

88
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,460
Say hello, everybody, to the VOG leaderboard, undoubtable winner for the whole damn year.

89
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,760
I don't know, the month's not over yet, a lot can happen in a couple days, but for the

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,860
whole year, I'm sure.

91
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,620
Say hello, everybody, to Flaco Jones.

92
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
Hi, everybody.

93
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,620
Hi, Flaco.

94
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,620
How are you?

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,620
I'm doing great.

96
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Yeah?

97
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,620
What's new?

98
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,620
Tiger Claw has more points.

99
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,420
If you just take points for the whole year, I'm pretty sure he's got the most points.

100
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
Oh, really?

101
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
Oh, then maybe.

102
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,460
But a number of times on the leaderboard, then yes, that's me.

103
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,540
Bobby has to figure all that shit out in the next couple days.

104
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,420
I don't envy him for that, but nevertheless, a great showing on the VOG network leaderboards

105
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
this year.

106
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,780
So thanks for playing.

107
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,260
Thank you.

108
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
I'm the winner.

109
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,260
Yes.

110
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,420
So you get to come on the show tonight and just glow.

111
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,420
That's my prize.

112
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,660
A winner is you.

113
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Congratulations.

114
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,700
Well, maybe we'll get like Tiger Claw to call in or somebody else to call in at the end

115
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,380
of the show and do a little gloating.

116
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,780
I want to hear from Immortal King too, because he's been neck and neck with you the past

117
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
couple months.

118
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Yeah.

119
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,260
He's got a point head start right at the beginning.

120
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,380
Well, he's he figured out how to play the system.

121
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,380
That's right.

122
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,380
So good for him.

123
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,660
He gets he gets I should give him a special piece of loot for that or something just to

124
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,540
give him enough points to beat you like a bank, like a piggy bank banked all these podcast

125
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
points from last month.

126
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,540
Exactly.

127
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,540
That'd be a great trophy.

128
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,660
Well, welcome back to the show.

129
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,260
For those that don't know, here's the deal.

130
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,780
Flaco Jones joined us for a show earlier this year.

131
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,020
I want to say it was around June, right?

132
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
It was in May.

133
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
It was in May.

134
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
Yeah.

135
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
Close enough.

136
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,260
Back in May.

137
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,860
And we were doing the show and we got to the classic game of the week, which is always

138
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,640
right at the end of part A. Right.

139
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,460
And that's right when the power went out.

140
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,660
Oh, right in the middle of me talking.

141
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,380
That is a killer for the show, because what happens is then then we lose the recorded

142
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,380
archive.

143
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,380
And so there was no podcast that week.

144
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,980
So it ended up being a live only show.

145
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
And we kept saying after that, we got to get Flaco back.

146
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
We got to get Flaco back.

147
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,980
Flaco's back.

148
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,980
Yeah, I'm back.

149
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,500
Well, the problem was I moved in June.

150
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,660
I moved away from Sacramento.

151
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,460
So I live like an hour away now.

152
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,180
So that was what made it so hard to get back.

153
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,100
You drove an hour all the way just to be here tonight.

154
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,820
Well, I had really good traffic, so I actually drove like 45 minutes.

155
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
Maybe you sped a little bit.

156
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,820
A little bit.

157
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
But nobody got me.

158
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
All right.

159
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
So I want to talk to you a little bit about like you and the types of games you play and

160
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,900
all that stuff.

161
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,220
What kind of video games are you into?

162
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,580
What kind of gamer are you?

163
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Console gamer?

164
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,580
PC gamer?

165
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
MMO player?

166
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,580
I'm a console gamer.

167
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,180
I mean, I do play some stuff on PC and I do like WoW a lot, but I still consider myself

168
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
mainly a console gamer.

169
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:42,100
Those are the games I prefer and I tend to like games that have a really good story.

170
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,060
Gameplay still got to be good, but if the story is good enough, if it's really, really

171
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,060
good, I can kind of sometimes forego some gameplay elements and I just go for story

172
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,180
games because I went to film school to be a screenwriter and so I'm all sucked up in

173
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,660
the story and I love games like Bioshock and I love RPGs because they always have really

174
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,340
good, really deep story.

175
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,060
So you must be really into Walking Dead these days because that's a game that's got to go.

176
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,340
I finally, we'll get into gaming weeks later, but I finally got exposed to Walking Dead

177
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,860
this past week and very well written game.

178
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
I was waiting on that.

180
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,460
I bought that one just a couple weeks ago.

181
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,820
I was waiting until it all had come out and I heard they did a good job.

182
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,940
I want to make sure they did a good job before I bought it because that started coming out

183
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,180
I think in April or something and I wasn't willing to just buy that now and then hope

184
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,100
that the rest would come out and still be good or anything like that.

185
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,420
So I waited until the whole thing came out and I bought the season pass even though the

186
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,740
season's over, but they still gave it the $5 off, you know, one of the games.

187
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,620
Well, there was a great sale on Xbox this week where all the, you know, they were given

188
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,620
away episode one for free and then all the episodes like two days ago, two through five

189
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,820
were only 200 points each.

190
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,460
So you can get the whole thing for like 10 bucks.

191
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,180
So I was like, yoink, thank you.

192
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,380
I'll be taking care of that.

193
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,420
So I had to play $20.

194
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,780
I have to play episodes two through five still at some point, but you know, that's all right.

195
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,940
Telltale has done a lot of great stuff the past couple of years.

196
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,180
I mean, they're only game that was kind of, and was Jurassic park, but a lot of the, I

197
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,580
mean, even then, I mean, I haven't played it, so I'm really going off of what I hear

198
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,900
on the internet, but even then Jurassic park has its people that are like, it's not as

199
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,300
bad as you guys make it out to be.

200
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Thanks, Rob.

201
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Now that song is stuck in my head again.

202
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,180
Jurassic park is frightened.

203
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
Yeah.

204
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,300
Or the actual theme song, Jurassic park, the weird Al one or whatever.

205
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
All right.

206
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,700
Um, let's see what else you used to work in the video game industry, right?

207
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Yeah.

208
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
I was a video game tester.

209
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,260
You were the tester.

210
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
I was the tester.

211
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,660
Oh, wait, no, not, not actually didn't know.

212
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,660
I did.

213
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,320
I did a play test for Sony as well.

214
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,300
They had us come in and do a play test for, Oh gosh, I can't remember the game now.

215
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,220
It was like maybe one of the Jack and Daxter games, like a multiplayer play test and that's

216
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
kind of what got me into it.

217
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,460
They put a Craigslist, Craigslist posting was like, come and do this play test.

218
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,060
We'll pay you 80 bucks and you get to just play the game multiplayer and it was more

219
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,420
of like a focus group testing thing.

220
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,220
And I did that and I was like, that was really fun.

221
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,340
So I started looking up a video game testing job opportunities and I found Konami and I

222
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,580
went and interviewed and I thought I did a horrible interview and I went home and they

223
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,580
called me back and said, you got the job.

224
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,660
Well seeing how Konami has been doing the past couple of years.

225
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,940
No, but this was just a while ago.

226
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,740
This is when Konami was doing a lot of really quality stuff, right?

227
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,900
Well, they were still, I mean, they still had metal gear stuff, but the stuff I, you

228
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,660
know, you were there during the period of a lot of, and this is all common knowledge

229
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
at this point.

230
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
I don't think there's any secrets anymore.

231
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,260
You were in the office that is since closed, right?

232
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Redwood Shores, I believe.

233
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,700
But you were out of there before that happened, right?

234
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,640
Just before they moved to LA, but everyone knew they were leaving.

235
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,220
But like, you know, you were there when Shane was there and like Mel B was there and a lot

236
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,120
of the people that did the Xbox DDR, uh, series, the ultra mix that did a lot of the step programming

237
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
and testing and so forth for that.

238
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,100
But you were really involved with the DDR stuff.

239
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,300
No, I didn't do DDR stuff.

240
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
I did.

241
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,620
I did a lot of karaoke revolution and Frogger was the first game I worked on.

242
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,020
It was like the Frogger DS game and there was like a Frogger, screw you, screw you for

243
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
all of that.

244
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,620
You should have told him this sucks.

245
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
Don't put it on.

246
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
Just let it die.

247
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
Let it die.

248
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,580
You know, I prefer to work on those games other than what they started cranking out

249
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,100
while I was there, which were really crappy licensed games where they would get licensed

250
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,740
off of Saturday morning cartoons and do that.

251
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:25,340
And I was like the head man for some reason because I took it with such a gosh, such enthusiasm.

252
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,100
I became the winks club guy.

253
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,580
It was a very small game, so they only needed like one or two people to work on it at a

254
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
time.

255
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,140
So I was the, the expert in all things winks and I, I took it and I was like, I'm going

256
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
to roll with this.

257
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,300
I watched, I watched the first season of the show and I was writing up bugs about continuity

258
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
problems.

259
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,020
It's like, Oh no, she wouldn't say that before she went on her first date with sky because

260
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
you know what though?

261
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,020
Here's the thing.

262
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,260
As much as I want to sit here and make fun of you.

263
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,220
How ironic is it now though that like my little pony is the coolest show on TV.

264
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,380
So like you were like hipster, you're watching little girl TV shows before it was cool and

265
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,940
you weren't even smoking weed.

266
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,940
Right?

267
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Yeah.

268
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,940
Except my little pony still isn't cool.

269
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,820
It was only cool in the eighties.

270
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,860
You can address those cards and letters to dark soccer.

271
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,580
I have kids now and I was watching Nickelodeon the other day and the winks club is on Nickelodeon

272
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,740
now and it's all computer and it looks weird and the voices are all different.

273
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,100
There was a British chick on that show and now she's not British.

274
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,740
She's just another purple haired girl.

275
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,660
And now they have another winks game.

276
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
I'm there.

277
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Is it another Konami winks game?

278
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
No, it's not Konami anymore.

279
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
It's d three.

280
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,220
Oh, Konami lost the license.

281
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,220
Sorry guys.

282
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,820
Ironically though, ironically though, the guy that was my Konami rep at the time who

283
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,460
was selling the winks game is now working for d three selling the winks game.

284
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
This is hilarious.

285
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Oh God.

286
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,900
That's, that's even worse than like Flaco is like Flaco just kind of got assigned to

287
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
it yet.

288
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,660
This guy has like been following it, right?

289
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,900
Well for him, he said it was, it was all right cause he's all, we've sold these in the past.

290
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
He's all I know.

291
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,380
I know about this franchise cause I had to sell it before.

292
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,820
So Konami made a lot of winks games.

293
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,100
I assume they were selling.

294
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,060
That's kind of like one of the guys I worked under over there.

295
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,300
He was like, you know, it's kind of a, that's, that's where the industry, or at least where

296
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,820
Konami was going was like, why put a bunch of money into a new IP that might not sell

297
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,140
if you can just buy a license and the parents are going to walk in, dig well, toys or us

298
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,700
and buy that game for their kid.

299
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Cause like, Oh my kid watches that show.

300
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
I'll just buy it.

301
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
And they don't even care about the game.

302
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,100
That's a lot of what kind of goes on in the industry.

303
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Heck yeah.

304
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,940
I mean it's for better or for worse.

305
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
I mean, yeah.

306
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,900
You know, the walking dead again, terrific game that happens to be based on a license.

307
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,300
It worked in that scenario, although I want to say, isn't there like a first person shooter

308
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,700
game as well, but it's like, there's one activisions put one out, but let me say it's not out yet.

309
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,820
The bar, not very high for that one.

310
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,340
And I'm worried that people are going to get confused.

311
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,860
The walking dead game from tell tales based on the comic.

312
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,520
The first procedure is going to be based on the show, which is based on the comic.

313
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,740
So it's like, it kind of dilutes itself a little bit.

314
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:08,260
So let me ask you something, Jim, does, do songs like this give you PTSD?

315
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,460
That was, I feel worse.

316
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Of course.

317
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Well, you know, I didn't hear that.

318
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
I didn't hear that.

319
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,140
I didn't catch the beginning when I was watching Nickelodeon, but I feel worse for the people

320
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,060
that worked at E3 and I had to work right next to the Winx booth because that song played

321
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
on a loop all the time.

322
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,780
At least when I did E3, I had to do, I got to showcase Pro Evolution, whatever it's called

323
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,660
soccer, a manly soccer, winning 11, 11 at the time, but I think they were dropping the

324
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,460
winning 11 title cause it sounded really stupid with 11 behind it.

325
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,300
But yeah, that song played on a loop like crazy change in chat, uh, saying, Jim, remember

326
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,380
when we worked on the PS2 PC one, that wasn't so bad to play.

327
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,420
No, I have that game.

328
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,660
I still have that.

329
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,300
I got, uh, are you going to show your kids someday?

330
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
I will.

331
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,720
You know, I, I have it on, I have a little emulator on my phone and I have the Game Boy

332
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,300
version on that and I've showed my kids that, that version.

333
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,520
And uh, even my son doesn't, doesn't mind it.

334
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
He likes it.

335
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,700
You press, if you press and hold the X button, Bloom charges up her flame attack and it shoots

336
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,620
out and it's like a pretty animation.

337
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,740
So my son likes that.

338
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,540
But yeah, I have the PC version.

339
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,220
I think I tried to show it to a bunch of friends and they were like, this is horrible.

340
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,780
But the PC version actually, out of all the games we played, that was the best one at

341
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,780
all the winks games.

342
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,620
It was the most like a game.

343
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,300
And then later on they just started making mini game collections with that were horrible.

344
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Hmm.

345
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Yeah, really bad.

346
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,340
But the first couple of games, they actually tried to make real games and then like, Oh,

347
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,340
we don't need to do that.

348
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,420
Let's, let's save even more money.

349
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,940
Just make mini games.

350
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,140
All right.

351
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,640
I guess some of our live was that you, you carry a curse with you apparently Flaco because

352
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,180
you know you shut off the power that one time.

353
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,580
Apparently some of our live listeners are getting dropped right now.

354
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
I don't know what's up.

355
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
But that hasn't happened for a while.

356
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,340
It hasn't happened ever since we got the new router at home.

357
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,260
So turn off your porn horns, everybody.

358
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,100
Um, it's cause I brought two mobile devices.

359
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,660
Well, also I want to point out, we're showing, I'm showing that the feed is still going and

360
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,100
we haven't had, usually if we have a big drop, I see it, it goes disconnect, dah, dah, dah,

361
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
dah.

362
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,380
And like, but we're, we're okay for right now.

363
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,380
So we'll see.

364
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,380
All right.

365
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,380
Um, anyhow.

366
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,860
Oh, now there it goes.

367
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,700
There's the reconnect.

368
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Good times.

369
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Live radio.

370
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
What can you do?

371
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,500
We are going to press forward best we can.

372
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,660
So no one ever gets to hear me tell my story, but no, you only have it on the podcast.

373
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
No, that's good.

374
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
Damn you.

375
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
Konami.

376
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
I think they're the ones shutting me down.

377
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
Like, Oh, he's talking about the wings.

378
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Turn it off.

379
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Turn it off.

380
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,660
Do you think they're DDoSing us right now?

381
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Yes.

382
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
All right.

383
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,200
Let me tell the chatters to calm down and twist your panties, everybody.

384
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
The world is fine.

385
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
All right.

386
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,960
Anyhow, barring a power outage, which you never know might happen.

387
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
All right.

388
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,040
Um, so you did the testing stuff for a while.

389
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
You did the wing, she and Frogger.

390
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
You didn't do DDR, but okay.

391
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,760
You did some of this cool stuff, a little metal gear, but you, you don't do game industry

392
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
stuff anymore.

393
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Right?

394
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
No, no.

395
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I got, I got out of that and when I graduated film school and, but instead of running to

396
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,660
Hollywood and doing that, I, I met a girl and I moved to Sacramento and, and I got an

397
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,360
awesome job at a school up here and I'm doing TV stuff, which is, which is great.

398
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,880
And it's so much better than the, Oh my gosh, I hope I survive plan that I thought I was

399
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
going to have college.

400
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,180
Like, let's go to Hollywood and try not to get killed and make movies.

401
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,640
And in this whole very interesting, it's a small world type of thing.

402
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,880
You married extra verse sister from Hoard House.

403
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Extra from Hoard House.

404
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I married.

405
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,960
So he's my brother-in-law, the guy who comes on here and talks about, you know, all sorts

406
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
of nasty stuff.

407
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's awesome though.

408
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Bleached assholes.

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes.

410
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There we go.

411
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,340
Who doesn't do any of that, like in real life around like, especially like family

412
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Oh no.

413
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
Yeah.

414
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
Yeah.

415
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Never.

416
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Never.

417
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
That's why he gets it out.

418
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,780
He has Tourette's, but it only takes place when he's doing a podcast.

419
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,100
Well, that's not, that's not true.

420
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,600
Usually when he's hanging out with friends too, but, uh, or when he's at a theme park

421
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,060
on a roller coaster.

422
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Yeah.

423
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,260
So, so the game testing stuff for you was just kind of like a bridge from one thing

424
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
to another, right?

425
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,940
It was a college job really.

426
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,420
I was not the kind of guy who could go to school and not work because I had to pay for

427
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
my rent and everything.

428
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,720
I didn't have a ton of financial aid.

429
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,240
So I had to have a full time job.

430
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
So it was crazy.

431
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,280
Cause I lived in, well, it's kind of confusing to say this to people who don't know, but

432
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,400
I lived in Concord and I worked in Redwood city and I went to school in San Francisco

433
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,320
side on Thursdays, especially I do this like triangle of doom where I took, where I took

434
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,120
Bart to Caltrain and went all the way down to Redwood city.

435
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,200
It was like hours on, on commuting just to go back and forth.

436
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,520
I wouldn't, I'd leave the house at like six in the morning and get home at, at 11 o'clock

437
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
at night.

438
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I had to do that to make ends meet.

439
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,520
It sounds like Konami worked out a lot better for you than like Burger King, which some

440
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
people have to do, right?

441
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,160
Oh, I used to move TVs for the good guys and that was horrible.

442
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,920
I hurt my back a couple of times and Konami paid better and I just got to sit on my butt

443
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
and play video games.

444
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Gotcha.

445
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
All right.

446
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Well, people do what they got to do.

447
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,220
Let me ask this, what, what kind of like, are there any like really funny stories about

448
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,240
like what might've happened, like going into your favorite game, like, like crazy testing

449
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,120
behind the scenes story, like, you know, not safe for work type things.

450
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Gosh, I don't want to like throw anybody in the bus.

451
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,060
Don't say their name.

452
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,160
Some people, you know, if, unless it was Shane, that might all mean say his name.

453
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,580
We would, we would, it was, it was a nice, relaxed like workplace.

454
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,500
It wasn't, I heard Sony was like a, was like a sweat shop, but I don't know, I didn't really

455
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,960
work there, but I heard it was like a sweat shop and it wasn't fun, but we would go out

456
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,400
on lunch and we'd get some drinks and we'd come back and it's like, oh, it's post-lunch

457
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,720
nap time and look at all these DDR pads make wonderful blankets and you know, just stuff

458
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
like that.

459
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,240
But you know, I'm drinking with my boss, I guess that sounds bad.

460
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,160
So they're drinking then like, well, it's not bad if I drink on the job kind of or at

461
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,320
lunch break.

462
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,980
So yeah, we would come back and, but we, we always got our work done.

463
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
That's all that matters, right?

464
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,040
And some jobs allow you to drink technically on the job, like especially if you are the

465
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,880
type of person that entertains clients.

466
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Yeah.

467
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,800
Well, I assume it wasn't like a prostitute.

468
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,440
I just assume because my superiors do it, that it wasn't against Konami's rules, so

469
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,920
I was going to be blissfully, you know, technically we're all temps anyway, so.

470
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Were there any girls?

471
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
There were a couple of girls.

472
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
That's good.

474
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,160
Some of them I still, I still, I still know like Facebook friends with and Twitter friends

475
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,280
and whatnot.

476
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
Was it kind of a fraternity environment?

477
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,320
That's what I hear about some testing things.

478
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,680
I mean, even though it was, there were girls too, you know, they're, they're, they're just

479
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
some of the bros too.

480
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Right.

481
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah.

482
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
I guess a little bit.

483
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
It wasn't, I don't think it was too crazy there.

484
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,040
Like, I don't know, maybe I hung out with the wrong crowd, but you know, I had friends

485
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,640
who were girls, friends who were gay, and it didn't seem like it was too much of like

486
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
a frat house.

487
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,140
Well, I don't mean necessarily like, I didn't know if it was like that company you talked

488
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,800
about a couple of weeks ago where they had strippers at their holiday party.

489
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
It wasn't like that.

490
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,520
That's a holiday party.

491
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
That's for the best.

492
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
I don't know.

493
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I mean, I don't know.

494
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,240
I mean, it was definitely like a fun like place to work, but it wasn't a total, like,

495
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,280
I mean, yeah, it was, it was a lot of guys there, but it wasn't like, it wasn't like

496
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
that Adam Sandler mama's boy movie.

497
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
We weren't all like that.

498
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120
I just want to say you told me a story one time and I don't remember if it was on the

499
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
show or not on the show.

500
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Maybe this was even you about some guy who came to work with no pants on or something.

501
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
Oh, that was not me.

502
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
So I don't know.

503
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,520
We did have a guy who come to work and I had a friend who worked there and he noticed this

504
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,060
and he had to tell me, he's like, we had a guy who came to work.

505
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,800
He wore like just a white undershirt basically for a shirt.

506
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,600
My friend would tap me on the shoulder.

507
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,020
He's like, I hate it when he wears that shirt cause all I can stare at are his big, dark

508
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,880
Asian nipples.

509
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:47,040
I wish you would put a darker shirt on cause I hate staring at his big, dark Asian nipples.

510
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,360
So yeah, but I don't know about anyone who came to work without any pants on.

511
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,320
See, once again, I was probably not hanging out with the right crowd.

512
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,760
Shane is yelling out in chat who it was, but since I don't want to, I got to be careful.

513
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Are you in the chat room?

514
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Okay.

515
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Yeah, I am now.

516
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
I guess I wasn't.

517
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Okay.

518
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Oh, he was the one.

519
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
See, I missed that one.

520
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,320
I must not have been there.

521
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,920
I got laid off for a couple months too.

522
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,480
Shane that told me that story.

523
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Oops.

524
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
All right.

525
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,000
You have a question from the chatters and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and all

526
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that.

527
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,680
Tiger Claw asks, during your time as a tester, did the company make you do some testing that

528
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
was out of the ordinary?

529
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm not sure how to take that question.

530
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,680
You know what, one thing that they asked me to do that was kind of cool actually was I

531
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,120
got to take a, a dev kit home because we had to test Metal Gear online and they wanted

532
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,600
to test it with different people's different service providers and stuff like that.

533
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
And so it was a big deal.

534
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I signed a bunch of paperwork.

535
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Maybe I shouldn't talk about it, but whatever.

536
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,520
I signed a bunch of paperwork and take the system home and actually got to test Metal

537
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,760
Gear 3 online from home and that was really fun and like no one's supposed to be there.

538
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Of course, my roommate was right there.

539
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
He's like, Oh, this is awesome.

540
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Like quiet.

541
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Yeah.

542
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Exactly.

543
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,480
We get on a conference call and we would all talk and then we were playing with the Japanese

544
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
play testers too.

545
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,880
And they were like just murdering us cause they'd already gotten to test the game.

546
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,280
We were just testing online functionality really.

547
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
They'd already tested it over in Japan.

548
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,360
We didn't get the triple A titles in Redwood City.

549
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,000
Usually it was those like Metal Gear stuff that was done in Japan.

550
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's not so secretive.

551
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's not that bad.

552
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,760
At the time they, you know, people want to know everything about a game like that and

553
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
yeah, you gotta be careful.

554
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,960
I don't remember ever being like told to test something like in some weird way.

555
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
I don't know.

556
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
But yeah, it was just, just taking it home.

557
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
That was kind of cool.

558
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,600
But it was, I didn't expect to ever have to be able to do testing at home.

559
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,280
Raginator says paternity testing would be testing is out of the ordinary.

560
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
He's not on the Maury show.

561
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Raginator.

562
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Yeah.

563
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
I didn't have to do any of that.

564
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,980
I'm trying to think cause the only one story that always sticks out with me is just because

565
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,680
the game was so terrible was that 25 to life and how like, you know, bad that game was

566
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
or whatever.

567
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,920
And you were telling me, Oh my gosh, that's right.

568
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Crime life.

569
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
I think it was crime life.

570
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm sorry.

571
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Yeah, that was a game.

572
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,600
I didn't test it, but in the downtime when I didn't get laid off the next time there

573
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,500
was downtime, they, they kind of have you just test games that are already out and really

574
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,960
buggy or they just, they just have old builds of and so to keep our skills, you know, kind

575
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
of tight.

576
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,760
And they would, they, so crime life was a game where if it was, it was a grand theft

577
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,800
out of rip off I guess, but you could throw like every box into this one room and then

578
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,280
trigger a cut scene and the guys are like, they get stuck trying to walk through like

579
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
a million boxes.

580
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,360
So we, we bug that game and that game was so bad.

581
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Like I don't think it was ever released.

582
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
I think it was just released in Europe.

583
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,400
Uh, no, it came out of an Xbox Xbox, but yeah, it was very, I don't know anything about that

584
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
game.

585
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
I just know it was terrible.

586
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,380
You know, despite all these, you know, extreme stories we're telling and so forth, you seem

587
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,760
very like positive and happy about the whole experience.

588
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,520
Would you say that, you know, you had a good experience and doing that whole thing and

589
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,360
yeah, that was one of my favorite jobs I've ever had.

590
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,800
Like the favorite, my favorite, I guess odd job that I've ever had.

591
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Like we like that I had to go through to get myself through college.

592
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,360
It was the bad and I worked there for like two years because a lot of people are always

593
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
like, Oh, game testing.

594
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,520
You have to, you have to play the same game for eight hours a day and it's not all the

595
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
glamour you think.

596
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,300
Well, I think like game testing wire, like, you know, it's like a similar, not really

597
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,440
a first job or, but a very early job, not like something like I wouldn't go right now.

598
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,640
Hey, I'm going to become a game tester to pay my way through my mortgage and stuff.

599
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
That's not going to happen.

600
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
It's just stupid.

601
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,240
However, my friend pays his bills by being a video game, a strategy guide writer.

602
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,760
Hey, yeah, whatever it is.

603
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,120
They wrote the one for Mass Effect three.

604
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,840
He says he can't play that game anymore.

605
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,560
So yeah, there's a lot, there's a lot of like playing the same game, but it's just how you

606
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
deal with that.

607
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,600
And if you just have fun with it, like I, like I said, I had fun with the winks.

608
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,080
I was put on this game that you had a positive attitude about, like I get to be lead tester

609
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,240
even if it's the winks.

610
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
I don't care.

611
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Yeah.

612
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,080
If you don't have a positive attitude, then yeah, that job could be horrible because you

613
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,920
could just be like, Oh, I'm playing Frogger and this is something I had to do in Frogger

614
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
that was kind of annoying.

615
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,000
And maybe this goes back to that question Tigerclaw had was they're like, we're, we

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,680
have all this time to test still now use the jump on every tile in the game.

617
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,520
So every square, like every tiny little piece that you could jump on, just jump on it and

618
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,020
see if you don't fall through the world.

619
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,040
And it was so annoying because it wasn't just stuff you would normally go through.

620
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,760
It was like, Oh, now use this cheat code to fly over the water and make sure that you

621
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
die in the water.

622
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,680
It's like, but over there I can't get there anyway.

623
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
What's the point?

624
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,800
So it was like, why am I?

625
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,280
So that, that got annoying after a while.

626
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,240
I was like, okay, I think we've tested this game enough.

627
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,000
Please get me out Frogger Frogger Frogger as hell.

628
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,560
And that was the first game I was on.

629
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
So it was like, is this what this job is going to be?

630
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,680
But that's a good little life lesson is that, uh, you know, if you have a positive attitude,

631
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,920
you can achieve anything.

632
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
That's right.

633
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Leaving your dream.

634
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
The more you know.

635
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
All right.

636
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,640
Well, thank you for giving us a little bit of the 10 year old behind the scenes dirt.

637
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
We appreciate it.

638
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Yeah.

639
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,920
But, um, so now you're, now you're doing other stuff.

640
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
You're doing stuff that's a little more with the film stuff.

641
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Yeah.

642
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Yeah.

643
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,360
Education and you know, video telecourses, ITV classes, things like that.

644
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,500
It's, it's pretty fun.

645
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,080
And I know your wife is a teacher too, so you kind of, you know, you're, you're like

646
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
a whole little teaching.

647
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,280
We all work in like education and her, uh, her oldest brother does as well.

648
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
He's a teacher.

649
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Her parents were teachers.

650
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,360
It's a very education based family.

651
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,560
So when I got to work at a school, I'm like, oh, this is cool.

652
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Yeah.

653
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,000
I get to hear all their war stories and now I have some of my own though.

654
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,280
I'm not a teacher, but still I, I interact with faculty and students and stuff.

655
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
It's pretty cool.

656
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Very cool.

657
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Very cool.

658
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,120
You know, stay a while and comment on the news with us and when we get into the second

659
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,000
half of the show tonight, we're going to talk a lot about the best and worst of the year.

660
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,320
So you'll definitely be talking along with us there.

661
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,400
And at the end of the show tonight, we're going to let you finally make up the segment

662
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,040
that was forever lost with your classic game of the week because Jamie wasn't here that

663
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
week.

664
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
So we let you do the classic game of the week.

665
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,680
So she has her own game this week, but we're going to let you do your makeup at the end.

666
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,300
So you, your teacher, you're familiar, or you're not a teacher yourself, you're in education.

667
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,520
You're familiar with makeup work.

668
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Yeah.

669
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
This is like your makeup assignment.

670
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
So I still have my notes.

671
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
There you go.

672
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Well done.

673
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,560
So I got made fun of last time I brought a binder, like notebook style line paper instead

674
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
of a computer.

675
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
You're ready to go.

676
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
You're more prepared than any of us.

677
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
I love it.

678
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
All right.

679
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,120
I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

680
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,840
Act Def says teaching is cool if you have the patience.

681
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Yeah.

682
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,040
You know, it's funny.

683
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,080
I'm kind of a teacher too, but I'm a corporate trainer.

684
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,200
It's technically my title.

685
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,760
So, you know, a little different.

686
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Okay.

687
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,720
We've got another question for Flaco, so why not?

688
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,920
Another question, did you ever find a bug in a game you tested that was never fixed

689
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
upon release?

690
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,280
I actually have an answer for this and it was a Winx game.

691
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,480
And this is like, it was, hurry up and go download it, Tiger Claw.

692
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Yeah.

693
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Game Boy Advance game.

694
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,500
And it was towards the end of the game and it's a really horrible bug and it was very

695
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
hard to reproduce.

696
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,880
It took me, I did try to reproduce like a hundred times and I got it like, first I was

697
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,040
getting like one time at every 50 I'd get it.

698
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,640
And then I got it to like one out of a hundred.

699
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,200
Then I tested it a hundred more times after they said they fixed it and it didn't happen

700
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
anymore.

701
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,680
And it was a game breaking bug where if you saved your game and then you walked into a

702
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,920
certain part of a wall, you'd walk through the wall and it would break the game and you

703
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,720
would never be able to, since you saved your game, you wouldn't be able to restart it.

704
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,920
You would pretty much a game killing game at the end.

705
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,280
You have to start all the way over from the beginning.

706
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,080
And they sound, they thought they'd fixed it, but then a customer service got a call

707
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,240
about it, you know, when after the aim and release and this little girl was trying to

708
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,140
play the game and it happened to her and she was stuck.

709
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,320
And I was like, the customer service person came and asked like, is there any way out

710
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
of this?

711
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
And I was like, there isn't.

712
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,480
That is a, that is a game killing bug and I thought so bad little girl, but it must

713
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,620
have been like an insane chance cause it's very rare they have you test like a test something

714
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,780
like a hundred times, but that it was such a big bug that I tried to do it and if I couldn't

715
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,320
get it to happen one out of a hundred, then they're like, okay, then we'll, we'll release

716
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
it.

717
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,280
You tried, but because you didn't try hard enough, some little girl's winks dreams were

718
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
shattered.

719
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,840
I need to try 500 times.

720
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,800
She threw that game boy advance at the TV, at the dog, and the lives were altered.

721
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,080
If you restarted from that save point, it would still, you would still be bugged and

722
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,040
you couldn't complete the game cause a door wouldn't open for you cause you could just

723
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,240
walk right through it and then it wouldn't trigger the rest of the level.

724
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,640
It's not the first game to have some of that.

725
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,160
Zelda or some shit had that too.

726
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,200
Remember they had to put out that fix on the Wii, the Zelda patch channel.

727
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Bubble Bubble.

728
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Yeah.

729
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,720
No boss on level 30 and Bubble Bubble, you know, there's, there's worse things that have

730
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
happened.

731
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
The card fighters ones.

732
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
All right.

733
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Uh, we're going to get into the news and all that good stuff.

734
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,160
We just wanted to say there was no show last week.

735
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,040
Sorry about it, but you know, it was the holidays.

736
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,520
I think a lot of your favorite podcast didn't end up doing a show.

737
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,160
We had a lot of stuff going on.

738
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:26,920
So, um, also, uh, we hope you guys had a safe holiday and um, also a happy new year and

739
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
all that good stuff.

740
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,640
Cause we, we won't be doing another show until it is 2013 so we want to wish you all a happy

741
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,960
new year and a safe new year.

742
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,040
Remember guys, if you're going to drink and drive plan in advance, what is going to be

743
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,400
your way to get home safely?

744
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,580
Do not drink and drive.

745
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,600
Get somebody sober, stay at, get a hotel, get a taxi, whatever you got to do.

746
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
All right.

747
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,640
Um, let's get into how our gaming weeks were.

748
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,760
I know I had a very busy gaming week, but let's start with a dark soccer.

749
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
How was your gaming week?

750
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,800
I played Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

751
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Kicking it old school.

752
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Yeah.

753
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,360
And then I realized, wait, why the crap am I trying to play this with the keyboard when

754
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,240
I could just hook up the nomad and play it on the Genesis?

755
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:12,320
So anyway, that was a one thing that I tried to play and I did play some more of that stupid

756
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,160
fairy solitaire game because it's stupid and addicting and stupid.

757
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Did I say stupid?

758
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Cause it's really stupid.

759
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,480
Um, and uh, oh yeah, I did play some Mass Effect.

760
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:31,920
Actually, I played a lot of Mass Effect and I played, um, wow, like for about 15 minutes

761
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,280
and um, I bought some games.

762
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,160
I got Limbo and I got closure.

763
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:43,320
I think I got closure though before last week, which is a neat game that uses light to create

764
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,980
your platforms or whatever the light shines on is what actually exists.

765
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
If there's no light on it, it doesn't exist.

766
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,140
So if you step back outside your spotlight, you'll fall through the ground and you can

767
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,420
either fall into another level or you can fall to your death.

768
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,420
That's part of it.

769
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,340
I bought Assassin's Creed 2, which is the only game in that series that I ever really,

770
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,620
you know, care about because it's set in Renaissance Italy and just, I don't know.

771
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,460
I kind of want to gank a de Medici.

772
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,340
You know, wouldn't that be fun?

773
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,420
Do you know who the de Medicis were?

774
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,420
You shook your head.

775
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:22,540
The de Medicis hired Michelangelo to design defenses for the house.

776
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,340
Not Michelangelo, Leonardo, one of those two.

777
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,460
And I remember one of them used to like mumble to himself in like one of the de Medicis diaries

778
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,500
and a bunch of them were popes and they also were persecuted during the bonfire of the

779
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
vanities.

780
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Wow.

781
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,940
I'm picturing Ninja Turtles, but I know you're not talking about that.

782
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,840
Fifth Dream in our chat room says, Dark Sakura, is it taking you this long to beat Mass Effect

783
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,100
or do you play it over and over?

784
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
I play it over and over.

785
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,260
I'm on my sixth play through right now.

786
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,540
And my big thing now is that I got FlyCam to work.

787
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,940
I finally bothered working on FlyCam.

788
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,580
So now I've been going around getting compromising screen captures of my character shooting things

789
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,380
and lasers and stuff.

790
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,980
And I finally figured out now how to get FlyCam to work in the cinematics.

791
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,100
So that's going to be even better.

792
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,580
Lots of fun screens.

793
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,580
And sort of speaking of video games, Mass Effect dot tumbler dot com.

794
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,940
Picking up some steam.

795
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,740
There you go.

796
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,660
Speaking of steam, more stuff needs to go on sale.

797
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
The end.

798
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
All right.

799
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,340
Loki, how was your gaming week?

800
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
I bought a lot of things.

801
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,940
Ironically, though, nothing from steam.

802
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,380
I mean, it is on steam, but it's not from steam.

803
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,940
So that that's weird thing.

804
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,340
It's like because steam had a bunch of stuff on sale.

805
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,460
But you know who also had stuff on sale?

806
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
Amazon.

807
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:46,220
Amazon had a ton of shit on sale and they had a ton of bundles on sale for really cheap.

808
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,140
Like I picked up one with Bioshock one and two and Duke Nukem Forever and Borderlands

809
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,380
Game of the Year edition, even though I already have it.

810
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,700
So obviously I'm going to be giving away games at some point soon.

811
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,660
There's also another THQ bundle that they had that had like seven games in it for like

812
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
seven bucks.

813
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,740
It's like, fuck, I can't pass that up.

814
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,980
That's awesome.

815
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,060
And then then I bought something else because I've been talking about it for a long time

816
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
now.

817
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm just like, you know, for that price, I can't I can't pass that up.

818
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,980
So I bought and actually played a good 13 hours of Final Fantasy 11.

819
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,400
And it's definitely different from when I was playing it before.

820
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,020
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

821
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,580
And there's it's a seriously it's a ghost town there.

822
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,660
And here's the funniest part, I actually tweeted about this because I was trying to get a few

823
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
other people to buy.

824
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,200
It was down to five bucks for everything like the game and all of the expansions.

825
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Five dollars.

826
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Well, they're ramping up.

827
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,060
They just announced the release of the next expansion is like the end of March or something.

828
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,780
So they're probably just trying to get a lot of people that will want to buy the expansion

829
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,980
full price.

830
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,980
That game.

831
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,900
I mean, we're probably getting to we're getting the predictions, I know, for 2013 later on.

832
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,780
But that game is going free to play this year.

833
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,380
There's our next year.

834
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,500
There's no way.

835
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
It's dead.

836
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,440
I mean, it's just there's no one there.

837
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,060
Like I was literally I'm soloing myself as a white mage right now.

838
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,460
I'm up to level 17 solo because you get so much more experience now, not even necessarily

839
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,580
just from the book burning the book burning.

840
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,700
I didn't really do that that much because there's no one like, you know how you would

841
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,600
say you were saying go do the book burning with parties up.

842
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
There's no one there.

843
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
There's no one there.

844
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,960
They're all gone in Guskin mines and Guskin mines.

845
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
There's no one there.

846
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,480
All like rank 99 or like level 99 stuff.

847
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,760
So there's no one to book burn with.

848
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,520
And you know, so I kind of did it a little bit through through one of the tombs or whatever

849
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,640
right next to Ron for.

850
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,360
But it's a little delayed reaction from dark Tetsuya in our chat room.

851
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Wait, what?

852
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,640
Loki went back to Final Fantasy 11.

853
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,520
Yeah, I don't know if it's going to I mean, I don't know if I'm actually going to pay

854
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
for it.

855
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,640
But I'm playing for the 30 days at the very least, because, you know, I got it for 10

856
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
bucks.

857
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
And so I'm going to check it out.

858
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,240
It's just I kind of want to have it because I do think it's going to go free to play and

859
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,120
I just want to be ready for when that happens.

860
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,260
Fifth Dream in chat.

861
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Got it on your recommendation.

862
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Yeah.

863
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
So you weren't alone.

864
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Yeah.

865
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
So good.

866
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
And but seriously, there's like no one around.

867
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,180
I mean, there's I was doing just checks of different places like the dunes.

868
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,040
There's like 19 people there.

869
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,240
Maybe nobody levels there anymore.

870
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
No one.

871
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,420
That's that's just not just there.

872
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,560
There's no one place where people are like.

873
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
I was like, OK.

874
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,920
I was like, OK, there's probably people there.

875
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Nope.

876
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
There's like 10 people there.

877
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,840
And we're like, you know, there's just it's just a ghost town.

878
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,740
What I usually do, I go in or that time, that month or two that I was on it, you zone in

879
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,280
the Guskin mines, see if there's anybody fighting right at the very start.

880
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,220
Like once you run past the initial like cave and just do a say, please invite to what they

881
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
don't call it raid.

882
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,220
What do they call it?

883
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Alliance or something.

884
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,460
Please invite to alliance or whatever party.

885
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,460
Can I have it?

886
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,640
You know, the whole auto translating.

887
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
And they'll just invite you right into the party.

888
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
So it goes.

889
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,320
So even if there's only 10 people in there, if they're all doing the leveling thing, just

890
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,400
so I'm also not high enough level to do that because I'm only level 17 right now.

891
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Do it.

892
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Seventeen's a great level for that.

893
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Yeah, maybe.

894
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Oh, trust me.

895
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Trust me.

896
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
People start doing it at 12.

897
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
All right.

898
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Well, I don't know.

899
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
It's just all new to me.

900
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,840
So right now I'm just soloing and I'm just going to probably try to get the 20 so I can

901
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,280
get my subclass thing going again and do all that stuff.

902
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
And I don't know.

903
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,000
By that time, it'll be the end of January and then they'll quit because I don't want

904
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
to pay 13 bucks a month for it.

905
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,480
But it's interesting and like I said, it's very different.

906
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Like, I don't know what's going on anymore.

907
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Playing it on the computer now versus what you had like five years ago, I'm sure is a

908
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
big shock to me.

909
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,720
Well, yeah, I can max out everything and I play on a controller.

910
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,600
So, you know, I do that.

911
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,720
I mean, I have my macros still, but since I'm playing on my laptop, you know, I just

912
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,040
use my macros on my keyboard and I play everything else on my Xbox 360 controller.

913
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,520
I used to have all of my macros done through my top two triggers.

914
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,600
Yeah, it's just I could do that, too, but I just don't want to.

915
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,040
I mean, I just it's a lot easier for me just to, you know, take my hand off the controller

916
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,040
and do, you know, control one, control two or whatever.

917
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,520
So I've just been doing that.

918
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:15,760
And I don't know, I've noticed like some new character, like new things like floating around

919
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
like there's all these pixies.

920
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,560
I don't know where the hell those are, but I pick fights with them and kill them.

921
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,640
Although it's weird, though, because I was resting one time and one of them healed me.

922
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,400
They come by and they heal you and they randomly raise you like if you're dead.

923
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,080
Oh, well, I've been just pissing them off and trying to kill them way to go.

924
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,160
Fuck you. Fuck you.

925
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,640
I agree with acidic vampire.

926
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,040
It's boring and it's a chore.

927
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
I was just read his comment.

928
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,960
A city vampire says I went to went back to fantasy eleven a few months ago, but stopped.

929
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,560
It did get boring and it was more of a chore than entertaining.

930
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,360
Yeah, that's what I'm kind of thinking, too, because there's not anyone on there.

931
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,560
But like I said, you know, just want to get the software and get it downloaded and

932
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
check it out just for a little bit, just because I was curious.

933
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,840
Ten bucks. I mean, that's less than a month of actually paying for it.

934
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,040
And five bucks, if you got lucky, that's even better.

935
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,440
But, you know, it's all the expansion so far.

936
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,760
You know, the new one will probably come out.

937
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,640
But I figure and I started a new character, too, because I could have done it on my

938
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,280
old account. Of course, I wouldn't have gotten a free month on my free month.

939
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,800
So, you know, I started a whole new one and.

940
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,520
I don't know, it's all right, it's just I wish there was someone to play with.

941
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,520
And there's really no one around.

942
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,880
I mean, it's just empty.

943
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
I'd love to come play, but if I hadn't burned myself out on it.

944
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,080
No, seriously, it's just it's very, very empty.

945
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,160
And I know you can get like what AI characters or whatever to help you out.

946
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,480
I'm not really sure how that works.

947
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,440
And I don't either. I think something like I said, I don't really know what's going

948
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,600
on in the game at all.

949
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,400
And I was like trying to remember what I'm supposed to be doing as far.

950
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,840
I mean, I know we're the kind of level and stuff before, but I was trying to remember

951
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,360
like what I'm supposed to be doing as far as like, you know, I know there's some

952
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,360
Sindori quests and stuff that you can do and just I don't know it.

953
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,560
I'm enjoying it somewhat.

954
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,160
It's just kind of good to like just play it and like let my mind just kind of go

955
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,480
because it's there's really no.

956
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,640
But there's like literally no one around.

957
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,040
Like I was just running around and I run across a couple of people and that's it.

958
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,360
And like even buying stuff from like the auction houses, stuff you need, it's just

959
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,200
not there because there's no one there.

960
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
Out of curiosity, is this getting you jazzed for Final Fantasy 14?

961
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,920
Nope.

962
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,320
No, I thought I'd try.

963
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,120
Not at all.

964
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,160
I mean, I saw a video of it looks nice, but it's just no, I'd rather honestly, when

965
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,880
Final Fantasy 14 comes out, I'd rather wait for this to go free play and play this

966
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,280
instead because this seems like it'd be more more interesting.

967
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,840
I mean, a 14 looks all right, but I'm sure it's not going to run that great on my

968
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,160
laptop.

969
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,160
I mean, it'll run all right on my laptop, but it's just not going to be, you know, as

970
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,160
smooth and I don't know how many people are going to be playing it.

971
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,080
It looks nice though.

972
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,440
I mean, it's just, I like 11.

973
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,920
I don't know.

974
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,480
It's 11 that I dedicate a lot, a lot of time to.

975
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:01,920
Okay.

976
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,760
So anyways, enough with 11, but other things I've been playing, I actually played

977
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,320
Borderlands 2 and went back to that.

978
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,040
So I've been playing co-op with my coworker.

979
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,240
So we've been playing through that and that it's actually pretty awesome.

980
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,160
So we got a little bit through the storyline.

981
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,920
Finally met up with, um, Oh, who the fuck is it?

982
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,840
Uh, the little girl that's crazy.

983
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,600
I don't remember her name anyways.

984
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,400
Um,

985
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,760
a tiny Tina.

986
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,600
That's the one.

987
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,760
So I met up with tiny Tina and she's just crazy, but I love the, just the humor in

988
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,840
the game is hilarious, you know, where she's like, you know, I need you to collect

989
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,600
my badonkadonks, which are these giant missiles.

990
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,960
And so then she straps, you know, these stuffed dolls to it.

991
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,320
Okay.

992
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,720
Put the damsels on the train track, you know?

993
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,240
And so she, and then she's like, okay, signal me when, when you want me to fire

994
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,040
these or whatever.

995
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,280
And she's like, I got tired of waiting.

996
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,760
So I fired it anyways, and it blows up the train track.

997
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,600
And then she's just like, Oh, it's just the humor.

998
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,280
The dialogue in the game is just awesome.

999
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,040
So, um, so that's pretty cool.

1000
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,960
And we're just playing through that a little bit.

1001
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,000
And what else did I play this week?

1002
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,040
Um, modern warfare three, a little bit more of that still.

1003
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,400
Um, I got this device called a Moga, which is from a company called PowerA.

1004
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,600
They were actually giving them away for like one day as part of like the secret

1005
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,640
Santa promotion thing.

1006
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:30,040
And so basically what a Moga is, it's this Bluetooth controller for an Android phone.

1007
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,920
And what's kind of cool about it though, is it has this little like slot that, or

1008
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,200
this little clasp that you can kind of, um, adjust to fit your phone and you play

1009
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,320
like a handheld gaming pad.

1010
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,240
I mean, it looks kind of similar to like a Xbox 360 controller crossed with a

1011
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,400
classic controller because they've got the analog placements of the Xbox 360.

1012
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,440
There's no D pad, although the left analog kind of has this diamond thing on it

1013
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,360
where it kind of does it eight way.

1014
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,960
Um, or it has it where you can kind of do it almost like a direction on it.

1015
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,400
Um, to make it a little bit easier.

1016
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,200
And then of course, you know, the X, Y, A, B buttons and two shoulder buttons.

1017
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,440
Um, and what's kind of cool is it came with some games with it.

1018
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,880
It came with modern combat four, which I haven't been able to download yet because

1019
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,480
my phone, it's the way they have it partitioned.

1020
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,920
I've got like, you know, 16 gigs on it, but two gigs of it is dedicated to apps.

1021
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:30,720
And there's no easy way to download something into that open, like that kind

1022
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,680
of virtual SD card that's in there.

1023
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,200
Um, so I've been unable to download that, but I was able to download

1024
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,440
Sonic CD for it and it plays awesome.

1025
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,160
I mean, it's just, it works great.

1026
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,400
And so they've comes with that comes a Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man.

1027
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,520
So, but it works good with the controller.

1028
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,760
So, uh, I am glad to see that this does work with Grand Theft Auto Vice City,

1029
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,680
which is just really CHD version of that.

1030
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,400
So, and I hear that's not selling as well as they had hoped.

1031
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,320
Well, I don't know if that's probably help.

1032
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,920
I mean, and this thing normally, I mean, if you, if I even get for free,

1033
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,160
it would have cost me 50 bucks, but I think it's worth it.

1034
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,680
And if you have a tablet or whatever, it will work wirelessly with your

1035
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,240
tablet because it's Bluetooth, which is kind of awesome.

1036
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,280
So, uh, you know, if you're looking for a controller, that might

1037
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,400
not be a bad one to pick up.

1038
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,400
Um, and it's, it's pretty small to you fits in your pocket.

1039
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,680
So I had that and, uh, what else did I apply this week?

1040
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,240
I don't know.

1041
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,960
I have a lot of games.

1042
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
Like I said, I bought stuff on steam sales and stuff.

1043
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,520
We've got like, he's, I'm hopefully going to give away for some games

1044
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,920
that I already have, uh, or games.

1045
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,720
I just don't want to play.

1046
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,440
And, um, so we'll figure out a way to do that soon.

1047
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,560
And yeah, sounds good.

1048
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,800
All right.

1049
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,640
Well, I want to move on with our gaming weeks, but I want to say hello to

1050
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,240
somebody else who's joining us in studio.

1051
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,640
Who's kind of been walking in and out, which he's allowed to

1052
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,920
do because it's his place too.

1053
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,160
Everybody say hello to Alan.

1054
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,720
Hello.

1055
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,440
How are you doing Alan?

1056
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,000
Good.

1057
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm sorry.

1058
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,160
I was sick last week and closed down the OLR studio with my Ebola.

1059
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,200
But you're feeling much better now, right?

1060
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,440
Yes.

1061
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,720
I had a head cold for six days.

1062
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,480
I don't recommend it.

1063
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,680
How did you, how did you finally cure yourself of the Ebola super yucky barf?

1064
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,920
You just wait six days until your immune system gets rid of it.

1065
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,600
There's really nothing I can do.

1066
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,520
I bought this, um, spray for my nose that felt like acid.

1067
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,680
That wasn't fun.

1068
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,280
It worked.

1069
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
I could breathe afterwards.

1070
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,080
Cause I think it burned out my skull, but did you, do you blame

1071
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,480
Obamacare for making you sick?

1072
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,440
I'm just kidding.

1073
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:22,960
Don't answer that.

1074
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,280
All right.

1075
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,840
Let's I blame coworkers.

1076
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,840
All right.

1077
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,480
Fair enough.

1078
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,200
All right.

1079
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,760
Uh, let's, uh, talk about your gaming week.

1080
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,680
So you were sick.

1081
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,880
So that's a great chance for you to play lots of games.

1082
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,600
Nothing like being sick on Christmas.

1083
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,160
What did you play?

1084
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,640
I was, I only played three games really the last couple of weeks.

1085
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,240
Wow.

1086
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,240
Um, this is more a discussion for Horde house, but I have no problems

1087
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,280
at all with this expansion pandaria, but the magic has been gone for me

1088
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,400
since like this summer, so I haven't been playing it nearly as much as I should.

1089
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,960
But I got played some wow.

1090
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,520
I played some Mass Effect two and I played some walking dead.

1091
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,960
So Mass Effect two.

1092
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,120
Okay.

1093
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,520
We've heard a lot about Mass Effect on the show, but you do like this

1094
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,640
mod thing, right with high res textures.

1095
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,320
Well, I'm on my third character.

1096
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,760
She is my female paragon, which is kind of like a good guy.

1097
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,320
Cause my first woman that I played was a renegade, which is more kind of an asshole.

1098
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,640
So it's my third career and yeah, I have all these high res textures

1099
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,040
for Mass Effect two that the community has made and they look awesome.

1100
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,200
But the only problem is, is that when you load them up, it takes it literally,

1101
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,920
I have to start it up and walk away and it takes the game 15 minutes to load.

1102
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,240
So I, if I want to play Mass Effect two, I got to give at least an hour

1103
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,640
to 90 minutes time, because if I'm going to let the game load for 20 minutes,

1104
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,600
I can't just do a mission and sign off.

1105
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,280
It's a waste of time.

1106
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,600
You have way too much patience.

1107
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,000
Well, I can all tab and look at Chrome or mess with my phone or tumbler tumbler.

1108
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,440
Yeah.

1109
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:50,960
All right.

1110
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,720
Uh, let's talk about walking dead.

1111
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,160
That's again, we haven't talked a lot about on this show, but you,

1112
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,360
uh, checked it out this week.

1113
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:56,760
What'd you think?

1114
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,280
I don't want to steal your thunder, but it was nice.

1115
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,920
Um, I was spoiled because I am on tumblr a lot.

1116
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,640
When episode five came out within a day, all of the animated gifts and

1117
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,000
YouTube clips and just discussions were going on my dash about what

1118
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,480
happens in the ending of, um, uh, chapter five.

1119
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,880
So I was like, Oh, that ending look, I'm not going to say anything about it, but

1120
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,400
I was like, I guess I should say that now that I know how it ends and how everyone

1121
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,280
is losing their shit over how it ends in a good way.

1122
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,840
So I just, and then also I saw you playing it and the fact it was 10 bucks on XBLA,

1123
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,000
right, and it was 12 bucks for the season pass on steam and like steam, of course,

1124
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,840
is having it's we hate you and we want you to be poor sale.

1125
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,080
So, um, that's a good name for it.

1126
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,600
So, um, despite the fact that, you know, you had the ending already ruined for

1127
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,320
you of episode five, how did you enjoy playing through episode one?

1128
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,760
It was good.

1129
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,040
I'm trying to juggle between being a perfectionist and wanting to play it with

1130
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,600
a FAQ open, just so I can see all the different ways I could control the story

1131
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,520
in later chapters, which I know is cheating, but I don't have that count.

1132
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,480
I have that kind of time.

1133
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,040
I don't care.

1134
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,920
Um, and also just wanting to be a contrarian because I wanted to do stuff

1135
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,200
that was opposite of what you were doing so that I can say, Oh, well, if you do

1136
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,680
this, then this is what happens instead.

1137
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,560
Cause like you have an iPhone and I have an Android cause I'm different like that.

1138
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,560
So yeah, I was like, I wanted, I'm trying to juggle between having things be as

1139
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,680
good as possible for my character, but also wanting to do like backwards.

1140
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,960
Ass backwards stuff.

1141
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,520
Doesn't that sound like somebody you want to date guys?

1142
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,800
Somebody that does intentionally the opposite of everything that you do.

1143
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,120
Just in video games and he has an Android and I have an iPhone.

1144
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,840
Yeah, clearly he's smarter than you.

1145
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,000
Hey, fuck off.

1146
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,440
All right.

1147
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,520
So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to steal your thunder, but if I'm going to mimic

1148
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,880
everything you do when you play, I should just sit behind you and watch you play

1149
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,240
myself.

1150
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,320
I'm going to have different people live than you do.

1151
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,240
And I'm going to do.

1152
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:51,520
Yeah.

1153
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,280
All right.

1154
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,680
That's fair.

1155
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,120
That's fair.

1156
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,640
But you do recommend it.

1157
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,240
Yeah.

1158
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,560
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

1159
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,120
Tiny tower.

1160
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,720
Sucks.

1161
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,200
No, I'm kidding.

1162
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,920
All right.

1163
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,200
Uh, we'll move on.

1164
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,600
So you're going to come back for part B and talk about game of the

1165
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,440
year and all that with us, right?

1166
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,080
Yes.

1167
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,520
Okay.

1168
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,120
We'll see you then.

1169
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,760
Uh, for now, Flaco, how was your gaming week?

1170
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,240
I had a, I had a very busy gaming week because I had the week off of work and

1171
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,200
I'm not playing wow right now because wow eats up a lot of time.

1172
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,360
I love it, but I just wanted to really focus on console stuff this week.

1173
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,840
So I played more Nino Cooney demo.

1174
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,520
I just play cause my son likes to watch it cause it's a cartoon.

1175
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,280
And, and then I liked playing it too.

1176
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,360
And so it gives me an excuse.

1177
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,840
I played the, I finished the walking dead after Christmas.

1178
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,560
I took, I took Christmas off of playing it, uh, because, uh, Exeter was in town

1179
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,720
and he didn't want to see how it was ended.

1180
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,360
So I waited and I waited.

1181
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,360
And as soon as he left, I finished playing it.

1182
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,960
So, and it was great.

1183
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,240
It was a great game.

1184
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,240
And I feel so bad that Alan got spoiled on the ending because I think that really

1185
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,000
helps not knowing what's going to happen.

1186
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,800
It's a, I think I know what happens, but I'm really trying to keep my

1187
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,640
spells self spoiler free and I'm just kind of trying to forget.

1188
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,080
I heard that and just taking the game at face value, but I'm still really

1189
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,280
enjoying episode one so far personally.

1190
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
I thought I knew what happened and luckily I was wrong.

1191
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,320
Oh, okay, cool.

1192
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,160
So yeah, I thought I heard a spoiler.

1193
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,800
Like I thought, and I was like, I thought I read something for two sec.

1194
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,720
I saw some words.

1195
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,760
I'm like, ah, the words erased from my memory.

1196
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,040
And then I just, you know, kept playing and I was like, oh good.

1197
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,000
What I thought was going to happen.

1198
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,720
Didn't happen just cause I read a few words and started making assumptions.

1199
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,880
So, so just real quick about, you know, the game, would this be something

1200
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,160
that would be all right for someone that doesn't follow the series?

1201
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,640
Cause I honestly, I've never watched nothing to do with a TV show.

1202
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,240
No, you don't have to read the comic book either.

1203
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,000
It doesn't matter as long as you know, the basic concept.

1204
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,400
I mean, they pretty much explain everything for you anyway, because it

1205
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,000
takes place and I guess at the start of the whole thing anyway, and you're

1206
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,040
in someone else's shoes, so everything's getting explained to you as if you were

1207
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,760
brand new, so you get the rules of the series and the comic, like it's

1208
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,400
really easy to jump into it.

1209
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,800
I don't read the comics.

1210
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
I just watched the show.

1211
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,440
So I don't even watch the show and I was able to get into it.

1212
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,120
I mean, it has a, it has an ambiguous opening, but like a lot

1213
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,960
of TV shows and movies do so.

1214
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,840
The show and I believe the comic opens the same way.

1215
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,000
Like nobody, I don't think, because like I said, didn't read the comic,

1216
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,480
but I don't think anyone knows how the whole thing started.

1217
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,200
Everybody gets kind of thrown into it.

1218
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,520
So they started the same way.

1219
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,280
Um, now obviously trying to be very, uh, careful not to spoil anything.

1220
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,880
Cause we have like act-deaf and Chad is like, no spoilers, please.

1221
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,960
No, we're not, we're not going to spoil.

1222
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,840
We're not assholes, don't worry.

1223
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,600
But, um, uh, I have heard a lot of people say like through the Twitters

1224
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,360
and so forth, that the walking dead has one of the best endings in a video

1225
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,880
game ever, would you sign up, would you sign ever, but it was really good.

1226
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,240
I mean, because you're so emotionally invested in the whole game, then when,

1227
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,920
you know, when you get to the end, it just feels like all the other choices

1228
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,560
you made are all like important.

1229
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,880
And that's, that's like a really cool thing.

1230
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,280
I find that fascinating, like in the wake of everything, everybody complained

1231
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,800
about with Mass Effect 3 this year, because like Mass Effect 3 was kind

1232
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,040
of the opposite of that word, but he bitched about the ending unless the

1233
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,400
first time you played through the ending was with the extended cut.

1234
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:09,920
Well, okay.

1235
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,360
But, but I didn't have that.

1236
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,960
And before that was in there and so forth, you know, as much as I loved Mass Effect

1237
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,720
3, the ending, and I still defend the ending to an extent, like I think

1238
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,160
people blow it way out of proportion.

1239
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,480
I think it's a fine ending, especially after the extended cut.

1240
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,960
But one of the biggest bitches even I had with it when I first did it was that it

1241
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,160
really seemed like a lot of the stuff you were working with, with the galaxy rating

1242
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,560
and things like that, didn't really end up doing shit when all was said and done.

1243
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,680
Like it didn't really play into it.

1244
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,160
And that's where a lot of people got upset with it.

1245
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,840
So it's kind of funny the way you talk about the walking dead.

1246
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,000
It really sounds like a lot, like you do get that reward.

1247
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,560
And maybe, yeah, I mean, it's hard to say because this was probably all in

1248
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,560
development long before Mass Effect 3 came out, but maybe Telltale kind of

1249
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,760
saw the reaction to Mass Effect 3's ending and made sure we're not going to do that.

1250
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,400
Yeah.

1251
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,480
And it's in the details because the actual, the actual ending you get,

1252
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,120
everybody gets the same ending.

1253
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,800
There's not alternate endings to this game.

1254
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,240
Everybody gets the same one, but it's in the details leading up to that final

1255
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,160
screen that everybody sees that's different.

1256
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,480
And the final, like one of the, one of the last kind of confrontations in the

1257
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,200
game, very heavy on past choices, all the way back to episode one and two and

1258
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,720
things like that.

1259
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,360
So fascinating.

1260
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,320
I mean, it's really cool.

1261
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,280
And I want to just blow through the whole series.

1262
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,160
You'll get to that part.

1263
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,640
You're like, why did I do that?

1264
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,040
Or why didn't I do this?

1265
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,720
And it's, it's really cool.

1266
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,880
It's just, they're really just details and it's story stuff, but I think that's

1267
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,600
what makes it so good because you're so invested in this so that when that

1268
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,640
happens, but the actual literal ending is the same for everybody.

1269
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,080
All right.

1270
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,840
Like did that, like whatever happens, you know, at the end is the end.

1271
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,880
Uh, what else for your gaming week?

1272
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:55,560
Oh, so for Christmas, my wife got me a PlayStation move, so I was playing a lot

1273
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,120
of games with that.

1274
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,840
I immediately got portal two in motion and what else did I get?

1275
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,840
Oh, I got the little big motion pack.

1276
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,120
We just got booted from chat cause there's too many people connected guys.

1277
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,000
So we're not in chat.

1278
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,280
Did you try to join chat Alan?

1279
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,960
That was a no, no.

1280
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,400
Okay.

1281
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,600
So we had five people join chat and now none of us can be in.

1282
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,400
Now none of us can be in so fast.

1283
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,120
We'll be at it.

1284
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,800
Oh, I will.

1285
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,160
I'll be back in chat.

1286
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,600
Okay.

1287
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,640
As soon as I get my phone up.

1288
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,440
So we're going to try to get a plan B here in a minute.

1289
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,960
Alan broke the rule.

1290
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,840
He's yelling at me from the other room that I didn't know the role I was in.

1291
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,000
I would have just not been in chat.

1292
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I didn't have to be in chat.

1293
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,680
All right, so we're going to try to get back in chat as soon as we can guys.

1294
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,880
It's going to be a little bit though, so just bear with us.

1295
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,120
Uh, but anyhow, let's just move forward.

1296
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,680
So, um, what else for your gaming week?

1297
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,920
Okay, so yeah, so I got, so my wife gave me the PlayStation move because I've

1298
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,320
been, I'm always bugging her, uh, her oldest brother and her sister-in-law to

1299
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,520
borrow theirs, but they are, their kids use it.

1300
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,000
They played just dance and like, but I want to use it cause I want to play, you

1301
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,200
know, I played heavy rain when I borrowed theirs and, but then I heard the portal

1302
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,160
two, uh, in motion pack came out and like, I want that so bad.

1303
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,680
So my wife just got me one.

1304
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,440
So now I can play it.

1305
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,600
I downloaded the portal two in motion.

1306
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,680
That was really cool.

1307
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,800
I only played like a couple levels.

1308
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,520
I played the tutorial and some of the levels after that.

1309
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,800
It was really fun.

1310
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,560
A little big planet with move is awesome.

1311
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,520
Uh, the move levels specifically are really good.

1312
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,880
And I played some, gosh, what is it called?

1313
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,680
It's like Cooper.

1314
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,760
Those had just lame move mini games, but, um, yeah, I'm excited.

1315
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,440
It works pretty well.

1316
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,320
And I played the Epic Mickey two demo, which I didn't like because, well, first

1317
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,200
I played it before I got a motion controller and I thought they were going

1318
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,080
to fix it where you didn't have to have motion control and they did, but you

1319
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,640
have to use the right analog stick to kind of aim, you know, where you paint

1320
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,000
stuff.

1321
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And so I hated that.

1322
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,960
So when I got the move, I'm like, oh, let me try it again with that.

1323
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,680
And it was better with the move, but I still don't like the game.

1324
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,000
And what else is my gaming week?

1325
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,440
Oh, and then I bought journey because I finished walking dead and I'm like,

1326
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,640
ah, I want to play one more game of the year candidate.

1327
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,600
And I want something short.

1328
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,960
And I had played the journey demo, uh, when it came out, don't stop believing.

1329
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:05,720
Yes.

1330
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,720
And I actually wasn't that impressed by the demo, but everyone kept saying, well,

1331
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,800
it's better when you get further into the game or whatever.

1332
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,560
So, but I just kept putting it off, like I'll get it.

1333
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,160
What's on sale.

1334
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,840
Well, it went on sale for PlayStation's winter sale.

1335
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,400
And so I got it and luckily I didn't have to play the first level again.

1336
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,160
It actually saved my progress from when I played the demo.

1337
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,080
So I get to jump right into the game and immediately it gets better.

1338
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,760
And it is a short game, but I loved it.

1339
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,080
And the ending is just Epic.

1340
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,240
Like parts of that remind me of, you know,

1341
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,360
Corona trigger when you're walking up the mountain and the wind blows,

1342
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,600
you have to hide behind the trees.

1343
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,880
So you don't get blown off the mountain.

1344
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,960
There's stuff in journey.

1345
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,600
That's like that.

1346
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,840
I'm like, oh, that's so cool.

1347
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,080
So it doesn't blow you entirely off the mountain, but it's,

1348
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,760
there's some really cool stuff in journey.

1349
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,960
It was reminding me of other games and there's like a kind of a platforming

1350
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,600
level that's my favorite level and journey where you just have to climb

1351
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,040
this tower and I'd love it.

1352
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,880
And it was, it was a lot better.

1353
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,600
Like I played a couple levels by myself cause I think it's supposed to be

1354
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,920
online and there's people like there,

1355
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,320
but I think whoever I was with was way ahead of me and it was really lame.

1356
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,720
Like I can't keep up with this guy.

1357
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,560
Uh, but the second time I kind of started again at that because once you beat

1358
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,880
it, you can start anywhere in the game.

1359
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,640
So I started at that level again,

1360
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,320
which is pretty close to the end and I played it through the end again and I

1361
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,560
had a partner the whole time and I even got a trophy for playing the majority of

1362
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,120
the game with a one person the whole time.

1363
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:24,720
Oh wow. Nice.

1364
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,560
Yeah. So I just, there's me and this other person.

1365
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,800
I think we're both kind of the same skill level.

1366
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,360
Maybe I maybe it was their first time.

1367
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,640
I don't know, but it was kind of cool.

1368
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,680
That's awesome. Yeah.

1369
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,760
Uh, I just want to, just a quick note for the live listeners.

1370
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,520
I did manage to get back into chat on my mobile because what I did is I did over

1371
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,040
4g so I have a different IP now.

1372
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,600
So I am in on mobile, so I will be able to read a chat comment.

1373
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,960
Some people are still talking about a walking dead in chat right now and uh,

1374
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,840
let's see.

1375
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,400
Fantasm chat says journey and a point and click adventure game of the years.

1376
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,400
That's if you believe everything you read on the internet and seeing the TV shows

1377
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,000
and stuff. Yeah,

1378
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,120
it seems like those are the two that are kind of taken a lot of their awards.

1379
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,240
So they were both awesome. Yeah. That's what I'll say. It's great. Yeah.

1380
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,040
I love journey. And I, I, like I said,

1381
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,640
I was a little skeptical cause I played the demo and I wasn't super impressed.

1382
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,240
I'm like, really? I'm going to play this for, you know,

1383
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,960
three hours and love it. Well, I loved it.

1384
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,240
It's a short little three hour game and I love,

1385
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,400
so you can't always base your impressions of a game off the demo.

1386
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,520
No Bobby heard that. I had to work that in there. Come on. All right.

1387
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,680
Uh, anything else you want to share about your gaming week? Um,

1388
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,560
I think that's basically, Oh, you know what? Uh, on my anniversary,

1389
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,080
my wife got her hair done and while she was doing that,

1390
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,520
I played linked to the past on my phone and I'm the last study.

1391
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,240
I've played it before, but I haven't played in a long time and I'm not,

1392
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,080
I'm in Gannon's like final dungeon. So good choice.

1393
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,080
I'm excited to finish that again for the first time in a long time. Okay.

1394
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,080
I have to ask this.

1395
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,680
Do you get as pissed off as I do when you're fighting the worm thing and it

1396
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,720
knocks you off the platform 57 times in a row.

1397
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,560
Yes. I hate that. I hate anytime. Anything that knocks you off a platform.

1398
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,160
The first time I ever played that guy, it took me two hours. Oh my gosh.

1399
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,040
Because I kept getting interrupted by my brothers and every time fall.

1400
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,480
Luckily I just had the knowledge of doing it before. So this time I was like,

1401
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,320
okay, I remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The first time it was terrible.

1402
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,440
So this time I was like, Oh yeah,

1403
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,160
I can beat this guy down cause I know exactly what to do and I know what spells

1404
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,200
are abilities to use for each boss. So it's kind of cool.

1405
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,200
But that was it for my gaming week. Little old school game. You throw it in there.

1406
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,720
No. All right. Let me talk about my gaming week.

1407
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,920
Cause some of the games we've already discussed a little bit.

1408
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,320
I did finally get a chance to check out a walking dead episode one at least. Um,

1409
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,120
let me just say this.

1410
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,040
It was good enough where I downloaded episodes two through five right after.

1411
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,160
I thought it was great. I don't even watch the show.

1412
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,080
I don't watch a lot of TV shows. And you know, again,

1413
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,720
I find that there's a lot of people that are like, Oh,

1414
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,000
I don't want to play the games cause I don't want to spoil myself for the show.

1415
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So just to be clear, games based off comics show based off books,

1416
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,320
right? Or something else. So is there based off the, well,

1417
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,760
it's based off the comic book universe.

1418
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,160
So it doesn't even spoil the comics cause it's a completely different thing.

1419
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,520
Yeah. So just they, they go different directions and the characters are there.

1420
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,000
Most of them are different and so forth. So yeah, you got all that going on.

1421
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,480
So just don't let that, um, ruin it for you. Um,

1422
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,480
some other games I played this week, um,

1423
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,800
I played a couple of racing games actually. Uh,

1424
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,360
the game rental service sent me a couple of racing games and I checked out need

1425
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,400
for speed. Most wanted that. Yeah. What do you think?

1426
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,320
Well, he's using his driving rig,

1427
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,320
the one he set up for that's going to make any racing game better for GT five.

1428
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,800
Yeah. He's been pretty into it. He likes it. Yeah.

1429
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,360
It's interesting cause this is a criterion game and the last big thing I know

1430
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,240
they did in the racing world was burnout paradise.

1431
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,840
So it's like somebody got burnout in my needs for speed. Now you don't have like

1432
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,120
the Epic crashes and all that,

1433
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,680
but it is like the whole cop chases back in there and so forth.

1434
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,360
But it's more like open world. Um, I like it. It's, it's fun.

1435
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,440
It's, you know, kind of,

1436
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,320
I like the open world element of it and the, um,

1437
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,880
places you can go and do the races and so forth. But, um, I gotta say,

1438
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,320
I played another racing game this week that's a little better.

1439
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,400
So it's been taking my attention away from need for speed. Most wanted.

1440
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,520
And that is sugar rush. No, I wish, uh, no force of horizon.

1441
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,560
I've been playing quite a bit of, and it's great. At first,

1442
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,400
I thought I was going to hate it cause I started playing it and I'm like,

1443
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,400
what the hell is this? Like Coachella festival in the middle of Colorado,

1444
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,600
uh, rich spoiled white kids, racing daddy's car and wrecking it.

1445
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,200
Like what the hell at hipster bands all over the place. What the hell is this?

1446
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,000
But actually it's they, they, the way they put it together is pretty good. Um,

1447
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,320
I don't like that you can't customize the protagonist at all, but whatever. Um,

1448
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,520
that's really a minor bitch. It's not really about that.

1449
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,560
It's about the racing and the racing element is really good. Uh,

1450
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,720
I like the fact that they have it set up with a very flexible difficulty.

1451
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,560
You can play this in like racing game for dummy mode and it's great.

1452
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,320
Having all the computer easy.

1453
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,360
You can have the thing like do the braking for you and there's guidelines,

1454
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,640
all this stuff. Or if you want it to be a little harder,

1455
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,840
you can turn whatever you want on and off.

1456
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,160
You can turn the rewind feature off.

1457
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,220
You can scale the difficulty of the opponents. You can turn off the line,

1458
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,800
the guideline and GPS thing.

1459
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,520
You can turn all that stuff and you get more credits as a reward because of it.

1460
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,240
But like the game experience isn't ruined if you use the handicap or whatsoever.

1461
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,720
So the way they've implemented the scaling difficulty is really good.

1462
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,600
So I have to give kudos for that.

1463
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,360
And as much as I joke about the hipster soundtrack,

1464
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,240
it actually is a pretty good soundtrack. So I give props for that as well.

1465
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,800
Although my one minor,

1466
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:30,120
minor bitch is that I hate that the game will not remember what radio station

1467
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,880
I've been listening to. I don't want to switch to the other one, but anyway,

1468
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,840
that's a really minor bitch. Uh, online support. Pretty good.

1469
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,240
Did some races with act theft and Bobby the other night.

1470
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,520
And we're all in the little VOG club on Forza horizon, which by the way,

1471
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,400
if you have the game request membership to the VOG club, V O G,

1472
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,240
very easy to find. And I'm an officer now so I can promote people or whatever.

1473
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,920
So if you want to do that and race with us, it's, it's, it's, it's, I've been,

1474
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,480
I've been meaning to use my racing.

1475
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,240
I have a Microsoft racing wheel with the pedals and everything and I have not,

1476
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,240
I've not used it for anything. I got it like a long time ago.

1477
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,560
I did not get my ass kicked in online mode as bad as I thought I would. I,

1478
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,760
we played at least seven or eight races. Yes.

1479
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,400
I came in last place in a couple of them, but I'm new. I'm allowed to,

1480
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,080
I came in third place on one of them.

1481
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,440
Have you painted your car yet?

1482
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,200
Uh, yes. All I've done is paint it, but I've seen the decal thing.

1483
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,400
Bobby has a VOG car with like the whole VOG logo with the glowing G.

1484
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,040
He emulated that logo very well in Forza horizon.

1485
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,480
And the cool thing is you can actually go into the shop and you can search for

1486
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,120
VOG and you can download that for your car if you have the screenprints of that

1487
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,840
to put in my portfolio as the use of the logo. No, that's fine.

1488
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,680
That's fine. Talk to Bobby about it. I don't know how to do that. So, uh,

1489
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,480
there you go. And, um,

1490
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,560
actdeft wants to clarify in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby and I,

1491
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,320
actdeft are leaders of the VOG club in Forza so you can ask any of us. So yeah,

1492
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,960
well I think you just ask for membership and whatever officer happens to see it,

1493
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,440
we'll approve it. So that's all. Um, but um, yeah,

1494
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,720
even though the whole thing is like Colorado,

1495
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:07,040
they're able to do some very varied environments. Like there's a little city,

1496
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,680
there's some really beautiful,

1497
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,640
like there's a cliffside race that was just like where you're going through

1498
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,480
tunnels and stuff that I was just like, Oh man, this is beautiful. Look at. So,

1499
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,040
um, and yeah, I had a great time with online mode and I love the scaling

1500
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,920
difficulty. It's, it's a great racing game.

1501
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,520
It's one of my favorite racing games I played in a very long time. Uh,

1502
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,120
this is probably the first game I've got from the rental service where I'm like,

1503
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,560
yeah, I want, I want to keep this one. I'm going to buy it. I'm going to,

1504
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,840
I'm going to keep it. So yes,

1505
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,960
highly recommend for as a horizon if you're into racing games,

1506
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,560
not like the other fours of games at all. That's very important to say.

1507
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,480
It's arcade more style. And I say that's great. I don't know if this is true.

1508
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,200
I heard a lot of the people that used to be with bizarre, you know, that made,

1509
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,400
um, the old, uh, fours of games, right? And then they made, um, uh,

1510
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,200
blur was the game that shut down that office unfortunately, which was a tragedy.

1511
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,360
But anyway, I hear a lot of them were involved with this anyway.

1512
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,560
But I don't know if that's true or not, but I believe it.

1513
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,640
I would absolutely believe it. So it's, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's great.

1514
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,440
I'm, I'm loving it. So, uh, now,

1515
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,280
now that I've said a lot of good things about it,

1516
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,440
I do need to express one of my kind of complaints.

1517
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,800
That's a big exclamation point. And it's not so much about the game itself,

1518
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:25,160
but it's more about the model and the game industry is in a very interesting

1519
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,400
place right now.

1520
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,360
And a lot of people are saying that one of the reasons why the PlayStation Vita

1521
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,120
is really struggling right now is not just the fact that it's the lack of games,

1522
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,280
but the fact that you have these like $40 games on the platform when you can get

1523
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,000
mobile games for 99 cents or a dollar and so forth. But as we all know,

1524
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,480
the way mobile games sustain themselves is that they try to sell all these extra

1525
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,440
things and the add ons, the enhancements to try and, you know, get you to like,

1526
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,680
like tiny tower Alan was talking about earlier.

1527
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,480
If you want to get the tower bucks so you can get a nice emulator,

1528
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,600
you can earn those very slowly in game,

1529
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,400
or you can buy them for real, real money.

1530
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,120
The reason why I bring that up for is it has a couple of features in it that I

1531
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,040
think are a little bit shady for real money.

1532
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,560
And some of that is that you can buy car credits that you can use to basically

1533
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:18,360
replace the in game currency to buy the cars instantaneously. Um,

1534
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,400
you can buy a cheat map or whatever that shows you all the discount, uh,

1535
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,000
that you, you, one little perk in the game is that as you break certain

1536
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,720
billboards, you increase the level of your discount you get at the upgrade shop.

1537
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,040
Well,

1538
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:34,880
you can buy a map for real money that shows you where all 100 of those discount

1539
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,040
billboards are. So it's like kind of makes game easier.

1540
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,440
Or it didn't just go on game facts or something like that and just do the same

1541
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,040
thing for free.

1542
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,000
It's all those like in game cheats you can buy and so forth and what have you.

1543
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,040
I understand the having different cars as DLC.

1544
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,360
I understand that having the horizon rally as DLC, but some of this other stuff,

1545
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,640
it's not that it ruins the game cause you don't have to do it.

1546
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,800
I just think it's a little bit tacky,

1547
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,680
especially when it's press right trigger to get it, you know,

1548
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,320
and then pops at the menu and buy.

1549
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,440
It's just like quit shoving that shit in my face because it's really tacky to

1550
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,520
ask me to pay 60 bucks for a game or whatever and then do this stuff on top of

1551
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,920
it. Now again, I'm just saying I did enjoy the game overall and I didn't pay 60

1552
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,200
bucks for it. I rented it. So maybe in some ways I did,

1553
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,160
I did get it for free and I deserve to have all the stuff shut in my face.

1554
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,080
But if I do decide to take the plunge and spend the 40, 50, 60 bucks to get it,

1555
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,400
I just wish the game would stop trying to nickel and dime me after that.

1556
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,840
It's like as a developer, I really think you need to choose which road are you

1557
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,000
going to go down? Are you going to charge 60 bucks for a fully featured game?

1558
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,440
Are you going to charge 99 cents for a half ass feature game and try to sell me

1559
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,160
the $50 worth of features? That's my big question about it.

1560
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,960
So just saying that's my one little bitch about the thing.

1561
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,720
Act Efton chat says, Rob, it's people from bizarre and Codemasters.

1562
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,280
That makes a lot of sense actually. So there you go. All right. By the way,

1563
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,480
Jamie, uh, I did also get in the car shop, the decal shop.

1564
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,400
Somebody made a car made with N seven sticker on it.

1565
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,480
It looks like the Normandy. It's adorable.

1566
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,840
Okay. I have to play this now. I thought you might say that. All right. Uh,

1567
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,120
that's it for my gaming week. Uh, I'll leave it at that.

1568
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:17,000
I felt like I played like a lot of games in my downtime and was able to play

1569
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,840
some. Wow.

1570
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,480
Yeah.

1571
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,920

01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,920
maybe we should get into some news. Uh, let me throw out some housekeeping.

01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,120
There's also a little mini URL that tiger Claude made some time back.

1580
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,920
It's like G plus dot T O slash orange on radio or something like that.

1581
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,880
I don't know. Anyway, uh, let's get into some actual news.

1582
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,000
Loki wants to start us off.

1583
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:02,080
So there was, um, a lot of drama with the game war Z, uh,

1584
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,240
you know, it was released on steam and it wasn't very good because it wasn't

1585
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,320
finished yet.

1586
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:13,200
And there was a bunch of this stuff that they had in the product description

1587
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,160
talking about, you know,

1588
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,600
the features of the game and not a lot of that was true.

1589
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:22,960
And then it got to the point where it was so bad that valve actually kicked it

1590
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,120
off steam until, you know, the publisher, or I should say the developer,

1591
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,760
fixes all the problems and issues with it. Um,

1592
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:35,780
so the kind of go along with that now they're having the actual name of the game

1593
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,560
being suspended and the trademark is kind of gone because of the movie world war

1594
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:47,400
Z, which is going to be coming out in 2013 with the zombie typhoon,

1595
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,720
you know, really weird trailer for that. But, um, yeah, so there, of course,

1596
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,680
you know, the war Z is a little too close to the world war Z and unfortunately

1597
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,680
the war Z filed their trademark request a little after world war Z.

1598
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,240
And so because of that, it's most likely going to go to, you know, paramount.

1599
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,560
Yeah. So now it's going to be called something else.

1600
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,040
I thought when I heard about that game that I was like,

1601
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,760
wasn't there that movie as well? Like I actually did look out for years.

1602
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,520
I kind of did think there was a, uh, a link between them. So I have to admit,

1603
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,360
uh, oops, I might not be helping, uh, the game's case here,

1604
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,000
but I kind of did think they were related at first before I read up a little

1605
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,160
more on the game. I finally did figure it out. Yeah.

1606
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,080
And unfortunately the game of me looks kind of like a rip off of the daisy. Um,

1607
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,280
if I remember correctly, I think this is actually,

1608
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,020
it's another game that has a similar title, like war something.

1609
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,320
And it's kind of like a zombie mode of that or a zombie mod of that.

1610
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,480
But, um, yeah, it kind of sucks.

1611
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,440
Another MMO trying to compete in that same franchise.

1612
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,200
Is this the same game that has all that fuckery behind it where the steam thing

1613
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,840
was misleading and all that? Yes.

1614
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,300
That was where the guy like use, you know,

1615
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,480
called his own fans that were abusing the game or whatever,

1616
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,680
a dirty word and all this stuff. And just like they're just on a kind of on a,

1617
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,280
you know, claiming there's multiple maps.

1618
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,600
There's only one claiming that the maps are like 1500 kilometers or whatever.

1619
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:21,000
It's not even close. I'm going to holla back to a 2011 reference,

1620
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,280
but it's like if that ocean marketing guy were running a game company,

1621
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,120
like that's just what I have pictured in my mind of like this.

1622
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,440
When I read about this guy and his antics with the game is I'm like, Oh my God,

1623
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,840
it's like that ocean marketing crap all over. Yeah. It's just, it's not,

1624
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,120
not boding well.

1625
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,600
And unfortunately I don't think the game will be able to recover from it because

1626
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,600
by the time that all this stuff is fixed and the final version of the game is

1627
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,120
done, I mean, you probably have the standalone Daisy client, so no,

1628
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,240
no one really cares. Right. I mean, some people cared cause they,

1629
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,840
they bought the game, but unfortunately it's pretty terrible cause you know,

1630
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,760
they never, they never said, Oh, Hey, this is like an alpha, you know,

1631
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,320
they were releasing as a paid game. It just, it's really weird.

1632
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,360
Uh, all righty. Well, um,

1633
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,560
let's move on to something completely different that happened this week. You know,

1634
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,840
this is a really slow news week.

1635
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,040
Some of the stories you're going to hear tonight are actually from the week we

1636
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,840
didn't have a show cause this past week,

1637
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,800
if we were to, unless we're talking about steam sales,

1638
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,480
in which case there was plenty of news on that. Well, we'll get to that. But um,

1639
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,640
this was a big story that actually happened this week just a couple of days ago.

1640
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,000
And you know, it's the end of an era of sorts. Um, PlayStation two,

1641
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,640
no more. It's done. At least in Japan,

1642
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,240
the PlayStation two has ceased shipping to Japanese retailers.

1643
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,080
Once the current stock of PlayStation two is off the Japanese shelves,

1644
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,040
it is gone. You know, it's the PlayStation two.

1645
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,840
The console is literally about 13 years old. You know,

1646
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,040
it's probably one of the longest lasting consoles out of any of them.

1647
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,600
It's had a good life, you know,

1648
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,000
but there's a lot of people this week that are like, Ooh, no more PS two.

1649
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:03,040
But I mean, come on guys. There's plenty of them out there. I think the only cast,

1650
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,640
I think the only reason this is actually sad is because not all the PlayStation

1651
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,080
threes are backwards compatible. So what if I need,

1652
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,600
what if my PlayStation two breaks and I need to get a new PlayStation two store?

1653
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,920
I guess that's what you're going to have to do, right? I don't know eBay now.

1654
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,160
And they don't say anything about the U S either,

1655
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,080
but I don't think these are exactly easy to find in the U S as it is.

1656
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,600
No, they don't. I don't. I mean, they still may sell some new PlayStation twos,

1657
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,040
but I know that they're pretty much done with the games.

1658
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,200
Damn you. Konami and pro Evo. So putting it on PS two, I mean,

1659
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,760
that's really a final fantasy chains of anduin or whatever it's called. That's,

1660
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,480
that's, remember we talked about that. That's the last PS two game is on.

1661
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,280
Well, you know, that's nice Japanese,

1662
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,200
although it would be interesting to see if they release it over here.

1663
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,080
I don't think they did with, uh, wings of a goddess,

1664
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,520
which was the last one that they had out.

1665
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,760
I don't know if that came out over here. Maybe it did. I just don't remember.

1666
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,880
It was a couple of years ago, but, um,

1667
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,400
I it's had a good run. Yeah, I know. What can you, what else can you say? Like,

1668
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,880
yeah. Oh wow. It's over. This is more just one of those damn.

1669
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,440
I'm getting old moments because I look at this going,

1670
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,000
I remember when this thing first came out and now they're no more. Right.

1671
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,200
Jamie, I'm rolling my eyes as hard as I can. It may be audible.

1672
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,040
Why? Because I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.

1673
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,920
I was actually surprised they were still making PS two games for a while after

1674
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,120
the PS three came out. I mean, yeah, I expected like maybe a year,

1675
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,400
but how long has the PS three been out now? What, two years, three years,

1676
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,320
something like that. Why? It's been more than that.

1677
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:37,480
I'm just, I'm so completely not surprised. It's time for, you know,

1678
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:42,360
but they're prepping for a next gen system and phasing out the,

1679
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,200
it's almost exactly how it happened with the first PlayStation. Well, yeah,

1680
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,280
it's just, there's no game sink coming out in PS two anymore. It doesn't matter.

1681
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,600
The people who are going to have one have one, right?

1682
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:58,000
I have a first model Japanese PlayStation two works just fine.

1683
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,200
Don't need a new one.

1684
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,920
I'm going to our chatters who are clarifying some of the Final Fantasy 11 issues.

1685
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:07,160
A Shane Alinko says they already said no more Final Fantasy 11 PlayStation two

1686
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,960
expansions in the U S Raginator says wings of the goddess did come out here,

1687
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,480
but there won't be any more here in the U S which makes sense. So who cares?

1688
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,560
It's just Final Fantasy 11 anyway. God damn.

1689
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,160
There's a lot of newer games you can be playing.

1690
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,000
I don't even know. Well,

1691
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,200
and the other thing too is I don't even know if that,

1692
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,400
couldn't they do it digitally? I mean,

1693
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,080
I know they don't really have anything in sort of in place for PlayStation two,

1694
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,240
but I mean, if you think about it, you could probably just download it.

1695
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,720
Cause I know they have those three kind of micro expansions.

1696
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,720
Those never really came out as a disc version,

1697
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,720
but they could do something like that. Yeah. You could download it to the hard drive.

1698
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,120
I don't know.

1699
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,520
Damn. There's so many job classes I was not aware of. I was like, well dude,

1700
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,480
what's all this? This is a scholar. I don't know. I'm smart guy.

1701
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,160
That's really gonna fight off a goblin.

1702
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,840
They're black mages and white mages. They're like gray mages,

1703
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,640
but their thing is that they, they're a great sub job because they can,

1704
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,480
you can do the, um, I forget what the skills call,

1705
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,760
but it's basically you enhance your black magic and weaken your white magic or

1706
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,240
vice versa. They're like a ying yang mage type of thing. So yeah, cool.

1707
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,960
And now you know, and now I know and dancers are great for soloing in the,

1708
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,880
in, in, in the end, most say, well, let's, let's,

1709
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,120
let's get to level 20 first because shit,

1710
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:25,160
I got to go do all that stuff solo now cause I'm not gonna be able to go back to

1711
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,640
play Ragnarok online now. Cause retro is fun. Hey,

1712
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,080
that's why I picked the Ragnarok server.

1713
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,600
So it'd be easy for me to remember which one it was. Cause I had a Ragnarok.

1714
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,520
Okay, cool. Yeah. Cause Bismarck's gone.

1715
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,880
So I don't even know where the hell my character would be anyways,

1716
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,280
even if I re did my old Bard black mage servers.

1717
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,160
Yeah. Uh, Flaco, you have fond memories of the PlayStation too.

1718
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,160
Yeah. And actually my wife and I were thinking about buying a slim a couple of

1719
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:54,680
years ago. So we went to fries and you get, I had one, but I mean I have one,

1720
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,000
but it was kinda, it's kinda flaky. It doesn't have a great video connection.

1721
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,080
It doesn't play. Sometimes it cuts out in the middle of playing a game.

1722
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,680
So it's dying and we, uh, she wanted to play Kingdom Hearts too.

1723
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,440
And so I was like, well, we're at, we're at fries. Let's just see. What is it?

1724
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,440
Like 20 bucks. It's still a hundred dollars two years ago at least.

1725
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,040
Oh wow. I'm not paying a hundred dollars for a PlayStation two.

1726
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,040
I saw one at the thrift store for 50.

1727
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,800
It's honestly because these older devices, they don't price protect them.

1728
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,760
So they're not going to drop the price cause they're losing money.

1729
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,280
Cause when they bought them, there was no margin in it anyway.

1730
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,120
So they're not going to eat, you know, 50 bucks on a console.

1731
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,480
They're just going to let it sit there until someone's dumb enough to buy it for

1732
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,280
that. I mean, that's why you gotta go secondhand.

1733
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,880
Yeah. I mean, well I had a used one. That was my whole point. I was like,

1734
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,440
but so we just hooked up the old one and it worked.

1735
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,400
My wife beat Kingdom Hearts two again and all was good.

1736
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,040
Well, I'm looking at Amazon and you know, they're,

1737
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,200
they're a little scarce to find. I mean,

1738
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,760
they're all from the secondhand sellers and uh,

1739
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,400
$149 new or 130 new, but $50 used or 43 99 used.

1740
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,880
So yeah, well mine held up. So that was good. But yeah, I was, I just didn't,

1741
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,400
I had no idea it would be a hundred dollars.

1742
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,720
I was thinking maybe 50 would be cool. I thought I was stupidly thinking,

1743
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,640
you know, it should be 20 bucks cause who plays that anymore?

1744
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,600
They need to amp up the backwards compatibility.

1745
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,440
I wish they would just fricking do as much software backwards compatibility as

1746
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,400
they can do. I mean, I realize not everything can be.

1747
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,240
They're just going to sell them now. Ah, bastards. That's all they're doing.

1748
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,920
Well, download games, right?

1749
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,840
Maybe that they could sell some more VITAs by doing that. But all right, uh,

1750
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,640
let's move on with some other news. Dark Sakura.

1751
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,200
Well, as I was saying earlier, there are steam sales. Yay.

1752
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,960
And I mean there's a crap load of sales. Um, there's daily sales,

1753
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,200
flash sales, prolonged discounts.

1754
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:48,080
You can basically see a game go on sale every 12 hours. Um,

1755
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,400
not really joking at all.

1756
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:54,720
They're doing like bundle sales like into like 75% off whole game series and

1757
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,240
stuff and you can get steam alerts. And now, um, it's like,

1758
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,840
uh, in fact I just had, um,

1759
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,440
the steam site open just a moment ago, but they had, um,

1760
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,000
hold on, say something, Rob.

1761
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,640
I was just to say,

1762
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,360
I wanted to check in with everybody on their steam casualties.

1763
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,680
What have you given into on this sale so far?

1764
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,980
I picked up, um,

1765
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:20,720
limbo and closure and um, I picked up,

1766
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:25,040
uh, what the crap game was that? Oh, Assassin's Creed two. Like I was saying,

1767
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,160
um, Skyrim isn't on a good enough sale yet for me to justify it.

1768
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,760
The Bioshock, um, franchise is on sale for 10 bucks.

1769
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,160
Check Skyrim again.

1770
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,920
It was the daily today or yesterday and that's as low as it's going to get.

1771
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,480
And the Bioshock franchise, I'm not going to pay 30 bucks.

1772
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,720
Bioshock franchise. Go Amazon. It's five bucks there.

1773
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,080
Let's still play it through. Yeah, I hear far cry three.

1774
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,560
You can get a better deal on some of the zombies game of the year edition is two

1775
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,200
49 and seriously, if you haven't played that by now, then where,

1776
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,720
what rock have you been under? Mass Effect two right now is five bucks.

1777
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,600
Mm hmm. I, uh,

1778
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,120
I bought Gianna sister's twisted dreams cause I wanted it anyway.

1779
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,680
The Valve collection is 50 bucks.

1780
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,600
That surprisingly is the only game I bought except I will say, uh,

1781
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:12,480
Alan trying to get the achievement for getting the gift meta thing or getting

1782
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,840
the meta, doing all little meta achievements for the holiday sale.

1783
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,360
He gave me a gift of a little dollar 50.

1784
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,200
I didn't know they had achievements for sale.

1785
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,760
They do anything to get you to buy.

1786
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,640
This is another game I'm actually kind of interested in.

1787
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,240
It's another two 50 game. It's called the tiny bang story.

1788
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,640
One of the indie games. It's,

1789
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,760
it's got some looks like it's some neat puzzle elements in it too. Um,

1790
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:42,480
but back on the mate, like critical mass postal, uh,

1791
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,400
beat hazard. Uh, let's see,

1792
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,400
I'm just trying to get the entire Indies super mega pack 30 games is 70 bucks,

1793
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,000
which for all of that. Yeah. Um,

1794
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,160
I will probably inevitably get dark souls again when it goes on like super sale.

1795
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:03,800
The far cry franchise is 50 bucks. Not bad market. The Ninja eight bucks,

1796
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,360
the Witcher eight, but which are two eight bucks. Flaco,

1797
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,760
have you given in any of the sales yet?

1798
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,520
I have not, but I already have a lot of those games.

1799
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,840
I have limbo and I love Bioshock. I have those and, and uh,

1800
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,560
and I got the humble bundle things. So I was like,

1801
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,600
I don't need more games that I'm not going to play because I still need to hook a

1802
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,360
computer up to my TV in the front room because I haven't had that since I

1803
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:30,960
moved. Hey, instead of five, eight bucks, get that. Cause if five's great,

1804
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,920
I don't really like the sub games, but other people can play them. I,

1805
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,840
you know this about me, here's, here's, here's something.

1806
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,220
If you want to get SIV five and some other games they have on Amazon.

1807
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:45,040
See cause I've been doing Amazon because they've everything steam codes and you

1808
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,480
can just redeem it over on steam and they're a little bit cheaper. Yeah.

1809
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,400
Shop around for the best bargain. The two K mega pack, which is, um,

1810
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:57,280
I think seven or nine games includes Bioshock to Bioshock borderlands game of

1811
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,720
the year edition, SIV city, Rome, Duke Nukem forever, complete pack mafia twos,

1812
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,800
SIV five game of the year edition,

1813
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:08,600
SIV for the complete edition and the stronghold collection for 30 bucks.

1814
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,560
I don't think I would even accept money to take Duke Nukem forever. Uh,

1815
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,080
act deaf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

1816
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,600
Loki check your profile and see the badges. That's,

1817
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,120
that's where the holiday sale meta achievements and all that crap is.

1818
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:26,120
Or don't, don't get suckered into that stuff. No. All right.

1819
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,120
I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the little mini games this

1820
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:34,920
year where it's like the little achievements within the games that were tied to

1821
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,320
the holiday. Like they haven't done things like that since last year.

1822
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,560
And I liked that. So like I remember last year they had the whole,

1823
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,600
get the pieces of coal and then like you could trade up the coal and get the

1824
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,160
games. I think that was so much better. But I guess, you know,

1825
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,360
beggars can't be choosers. It's awesome. They're doing what they are as it is.

1826
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:54,040
So, all right. Um, let's move on with some more news. Uh,

1827
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,120
Loki, I think you're next. All right.

1828
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,480
So let's talk a little bit about this thing called Disney infinity that we're

1829
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,720
just hearing about for the first time. What is this Disney infinity?

1830
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
But there's rumors.

1831
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,720
It's apparently a new gaming initiative that's going to have something to do

1832
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,520
with, uh,

1833
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,340
this thing called toy box that is going to have Disney and Pixar characters

1834
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:19,620
interacting in games across multiple platforms. And,

1835
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:23,620
and it's also going to be like, you know, sort of like Skylanders.

1836
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:27,180
And apparently they're going to tell us more about it in, um,

1837
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:31,260
January. And also I guess it's going to be a sandbox game.

1838
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,820
They're saying it's going to be similar to the toy box mode in toy story three.

1839
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,720
Um, yeah, it's very interesting.

1840
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,720
I wish we had more information about it as if like, you know,

1841
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,880
we had some sort of document or something that, Oh,

1842
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,960
what the hell is this that's in my lap here from like weeks ago that is under a

1843
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,560
pile of cords and stuff. It's a document about Disney infinity. That's so weird.

1844
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,400
So weird.

1845
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,560
Let's see here.

1846
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,380
Introducing a new game platform takes you to an infinite game possibilities and

1847
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:04,800
beyond.

1848
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,360
Imagine bringing together your favorite Disney and Disney Pixar heroes stories

1849
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,000
and locations as toys to create your own unique customized environments,

1850
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,480
adventures, and stories just the way you want them.

1851
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:18,160
Now you can with Disney infinity, the possibilities are infinite,

1852
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,880
but it sounds like the game itself may not be like, you know,

1853
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,720
we know it's inspired by Skylanders,

1854
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,000
the whole like real life figures and this whole thing,

1855
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:29,640
but it's not that the game itself may not necessarily be Skylanders because

1856
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,760
Skylanders is apparently very Diablo. Yeah.

1857
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,600
I think it is going to be kind of more like the toy box mode because they're

1858
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,880
talking about, okay, so some of the stuff that they're going to, you know,

1859
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,520
be tying in with, it's mainly gonna be a lot of movie tie-ins and stuff.

1860
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,840
So for example, since this game is supposed to be coming out around June,

1861
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,700
you're going to have like the first few things, the monsters,

1862
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:50,800
university Pixar's or cars.

1863
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,960
I say they're doing cars, 3d or something like that. The lone ranger,

1864
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,640
the Incredibles. I think that's also getting like a 3d treatment as well.

1865
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,240
Toy story, parts of the Caribbean.

1866
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,320
And they're saying the different types of things like they're going to have

1867
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,240
gadgets, buildings, vehicles, environments, et cetera.

1868
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,720
Basically the way they have it work is each character's got a character coins

1869
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,880
and like a place at pieces and they kind of put,

1870
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,320
they get put down on this reader and then when you put them on the reader,

1871
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:25,000
it unlocks game content, but they are actual figures.

1872
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,800
They're not there. They're their actual figures.

1873
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,360
Actual reader is actually kind of the same shape as the infinity logo or the in

1874
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,280
that they have in the infinity logo. It's like this weird like, yeah,

1875
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,120
it's this weird, like uneven hexagon thing, um, that they've got there.

1876
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,360
At least that's in the little, um, little thing. And yeah,

1877
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:48,640
it's a apparently, yeah, it says open world, innovative game design,

1878
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,320
triple a quality game, uh,

1879
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,720
complete line of interactive game pieces supporting all platforms,

1880
01:24:55,160 --> 01:25:00,240
supports all T, uh, TWDC events. Um,

1881
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,040
so yeah. Um, we, it looks like it'd be interesting. I mean,

1882
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,560
more interesting as Skylars, that's for sure, but whatever.

1883
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,840
Cause it's Disney and you know,

1884
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,080
you know people are going to fucking eat this shit up and it's because, um,

1885
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,920
it's, I mean, look at just like the crap that people come.

1886
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,880
I'm a little worried about Flaco. Not only is he a Disney addict,

1887
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,720
like the rest of us, but he has kids and he can justify, Oh, it's for the kids.

1888
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,640
I know if my kids, if my kids want Skylanders, I'll be like, no,

1889
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,920
but if you want something similar, you can get Disney. I'll be fine with that.

1890
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,920
You know? So yeah, I mean, uh, it'll be interesting, but yeah.

1891
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,360
Will you find an excuse to go to Disneyland just because they have a limited

1892
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,640
edition character that you can only get like in the park?

1893
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,880
Cause you know that shit's going to happen. I'll go anyway. I don't care.

1894
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,040
Well anyways,

1895
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:51,000
you'll be hearing it from the rest of the game blogs in January because they're

1896
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,800
all sort of embargo or some bullshit, but you know what?

1897
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,880
No fucking embargoes on this train

1898
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,480
because no one shares information with us. All right. Fair enough.

1899
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,760
It's just Disney infinity. It's not Fort Knox. We all know what's coming.

1900
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,000
There it is. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's talk about,

1901
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,760
let's go from Disney to talking about pornography, shall we?

1902
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,640
Yay. Well, that's an easy segue. I'm suddenly reminded of this, this, uh,

1903
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,320
GIF I saw of the wicked queen from snow white and she's,

1904
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,000
she's holding this open box and she has the scowl on her face and the little

1905
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,720
capture says, who put a dick in this box? That was awesome. Yeah, that's great.

1906
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,280
Anyway. Uh, let's talk about porn. Uh,

1907
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:37,920
porn found on a three DS and was traded into GameStop.

1908
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,160
Oh boy. Yes. Uh, let's see.

1909
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,840
This is actually a report from the daily mail. Uh, they got this,

1910
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:49,840
I guess a refurbished Nintendo three DS had nine pornographic images on it and

1911
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:55,120
was, uh, yet traded into GameStop. Oh wait, does this,

1912
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,760
does this link to a local news story? It does.

1913
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,560
I got to do that cause it looks like it's channel nine news here in the States.

1914
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,280
Oh, I gotta find this. Where? Yes.

1915
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,840
We get to hear sensationalist local news. I love sensations.

1916
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,200
Let's hear sensationalist local news. Tell the story.

1917
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,000
Who can take a small problem and just blow it way out of proportion.

1918
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,440
Local news. We need a bumper for local news that just distorts everything.

1919
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,280
All right, here we go. Local news on porn.

1920
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,360
I don't want to hear zip ties.

1921
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,600
I love zip ties. Tell me more blowing zip ties out of proportion.

1922
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,040
Dude, did they have like a shop that's dedicated to zip ties?

1923
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,520
Because that's fucking awesome. I want to know more zip ties.

1924
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,600
Your long zip ties, your small zip ties, your colored zip ties.

1925
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,160
You know what? What the hell? It's, it's apparently that's the city.

1926
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:50,560
It's a store called a to Z and it has everything from

1927
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,560
zip ties.

1928
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,360
People who like work with a lot of chords and people who want to murder people.

1929
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,520
All right. Local news time. Shut up.

1930
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:01,800
New tonight,

1931
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:05,440
a father from Lakewood had to return one gift that was given his son.

1932
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,560
He says it traumatized his family.

1933
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,920
The five year old boy found pornographic pictures on the refurbished game device

1934
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,920
he got for Christmas. Nine news reporter,

1935
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,400
Megan Fitzgerald joins us from the GameStop where the item was purchased.

1936
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,480
Megan, the company says it's trying to make it right. Adele,

1937
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,520
that's what they're saying. But the dad just does it. Wait, the reporter,

1938
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,080
the, the lady's name is Adele. Is that, did I,

1939
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,640
she's that fired their name. Did I hear that correctly?

1940
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:35,280
Is the news lady's name Adele? You know, people are named Adele by the way.

1941
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,760
Let's go outside the GameStop and watch this guy. Oh, watch.

1942
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,600
See how that's possible since you can't just erase these images from his son's

1943
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,960
brain, but the store behind me. But he's tried.

1944
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,480
If the family, a brand new upgraded Nintendo 3d ass,

1945
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,080
they also threw in some games in there,

1946
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,440
but the dad says there's really no way to make this right.

1947
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,760
He just wants to let other families know. So it doesn't happen to their kids.

1948
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,600
When you're a kid, hands down the best.

1949
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,480
That's the name of the electric buzzsaw, by the way,

1950
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,560
trying to get into the kid's brain. I'm kidding. It's a toy tank.

1951
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,880
Part about Christmas is jumping out of bed.

1952
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,800
It's really exhilarating and seeing all the toys.

1953
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,960
Especially when you're five.

1954
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,560
And especially when you've been waiting all year round for that special toy.

1955
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,560
I get a 3d. Yeah, you got a 3d. Yes, that's right. And these are some,

1956
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,000
these are the pictures that we took this morning. There's Brayden,

1957
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:35,200
but Wednesday morning, that excitement turned to horror.

1958
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,840
He ended a 3d S to Brighton and Brian said, dad,

1959
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,440
I don't think he should be looking at these pictures.

1960
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:46,720
I don't think we should be looking at these pictures. It's just a DS.

1961
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,000
It's not a 3d S. It's just exactly like a DS. You are five.

1962
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,960
You shouldn't be looking at those pictures because don't you read the warning

1963
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,880
that you're not supposed to play it when you're under seven or you're going to

1964
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,080
go cross. Did you hear that? I said, dad,

1965
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,840
this DS has porn on it.

1966
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,320
And I handed him the DS and he just got up and are they all crying?

1967
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,400
Hold on. Hold on. First world problems. First world problems. Hold on.

1968
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,080
And the kid is crying. How does the kid know what porn is?

1969
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:20,320
How does the first thing he said was this has porn on it and doesn't know what

1970
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:20,760
porn is.

1971
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,760
Because I would think that a five year old isn't probably going to know what

1972
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,160
that stuff is and all those people are being silly expert, AKA a mom.

1973
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,800
Does, does your son know what porn is?

1974
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,800
Um, this whole thing really? I'm,

1975
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,080
I'm allegedly in my opinion, this themes,

1976
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,320
things seems like it's being set up for a lawsuit.

1977
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,840
Yeah. Look good on camera guys. Make sure you're crying. And,

1978
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,040
and they told the kid what to say. Cause yeah, yeah.

1979
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,880
There's poured on the DS daddy. Hmm.

1980
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,640
I'm asking Becky even fifth dream in chat.

1981
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:58,800
Why does a five year old know what porn means to the phone? Oh, I lost it.

1982
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,880
I, I just called everybody.

1983
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,840
Really?

1984
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,920
It was hard for Mark Giles as two young sons to see pornographic images on their

1985
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,560
toy. Now look,

1986
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,560
I get if somebody is like super religious or whatever and is offended by the

1987
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,960
side of porn and so forth and just does and the fact that like a kid saw it,

1988
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,560
because you know, as much as we're, we're laughing to have a good time with it,

1989
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,840
it is fucked up that a kid, you know,

1990
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,680
that didn't want to be subjected to it got subjected to it. But I'm sorry,

1991
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,640
this is way over the top for me. But you know what? So here's not angry.

1992
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,720
You know, it's even worse about it.

1993
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,840
Hate the spoiled part of the story here that we're probably gonna get to here.

1994
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,840
I think he said it was from Santa Claus.

1995
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,760
Okay.

1996
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,840
That was a gift from Santa Claus. There's another one.

1997
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,840
I can't be mature about it. I can't be there. There's another one.

1998
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,000
There was another one that I saw too that wasn't necessarily this,

1999
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,400
but it was one of those where you buy stuff from Walmart as a returned item and

2000
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,240
in the box instead of a 3ds it was rocks.

2001
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:07,600
That's great. Okay. So I asked Becky for the sake of the show,

2002
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:11,200
does Julian know what porn is? And I did at the end.

2003
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:16,840
And she says no in big bold letters with four exclamation points and then

2004
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:20,160
lol. But it was even harder for him.

2005
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:25,680
And then I said, um, we know what was going on. And she said, weird.

2006
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,720
So that's coming from a mom with a five year old just saying, all right, let me,

2007
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:35,760
let me let these sensationalist local news courtesy of nine news finish up here

2008
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,720
who tried so hard to make Christmas special about nine minutes,

2009
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:45,440
nine images of a sexual activity on his

2010
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,800
toy that he got from Santa that Santa got from GameStop.

2011
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,000
So GameStop tried to make it right.

2012
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:56,120
They told Giles the images were from a previous owner and they weren't caught

2013
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,520
before the refurbished device was sold.

2014
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,080
But you can't unsee this. He's five years old.

2015
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:05,520
Now maybe when he's 18 or 20 and maybe he won't know anything about the kids are

2016
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,000
hugging right now in the little,

2017
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,920
they're showing a picture of the kids has no freaking clue what's going on,

2018
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,320
comforting each other about this horrific imagery.

2019
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,760
He's not going to forget about it tomorrow.

2020
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,720
And the company wouldn't go on camera,

2021
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,300
but the corporate office sent us the following statement.

2022
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:25,560
It says GameStop is currently researching the situation.

2023
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:29,720
We have a rigorous quality control process in place to ensure that existing

2024
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:34,720
content is removed from all devices before they are resold out of millions of

2025
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,200
transactions each year. One's like this happened very rarely.

2026
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,080
Our number one priority is to make this right for our customers.

2027
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:46,080
Degenerate Johnny in our chat room says ROFL Santa shops at the evil G

2028
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,960
and an employee at the GameStop behind us told Giles that they're going to do

2029
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,640
their own investigation to try and find out how this happened to Dell so that

2030
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:56,960
they can make sure it doesn't happen again.

2031
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,840
I'm kind of curious, Megan, is this type of a bulk eraser?

2032
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,360
It would seem like that you would erase everything on every unit.

2033
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,520
You would think so, Adele.

2034
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:09,960
In fact the father was saying that there was a SIM card that easily could have

2035
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,080
just been removed that would have, uh, erased all of these images.

2036
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,760
But unfortunately that wasn't the case.

2037
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,720
Of course we weren't going to show those images because they were very

2038
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,880
graphic. But again, the company is saying that they,

2039
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,680
they try and catch things like this,

2040
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,960
but this one obviously slipped through the cracks obviously. All right,

2041
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,160
Megan distro. Thanks Megan.

2042
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,840
Really? Really? They're going to launch an investigation to it. Like, Oh,

2043
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,800
some dickhead forgot to like erase this thing is with the way that GameStop

2044
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:39,720
functions. Probably half that store is fired because they'll know seriously.

2045
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,880
You're right. Probably because they fire their employees.

2046
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:46,280
They make up shit to fire their employees over. I'm not lying.

2047
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,160
I don't think that, I don't think that that story to get fired. Cause anything,

2048
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:52,880
any systems that they take back for refers to get sent away to this is,

2049
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,280
there's a reason why there's a reason why they're called evil G Loki.

2050
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:00,960
They fire people for the tiniest of little reasons. I know people personally,

2051
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,280
why do you think my husband quit?

2052
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:08,120
Act deft in our chat room says they could have had the porn,

2053
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:12,880
but they're rolling in the deep. All right, forget it. Look, I, it is a,

2054
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,240
it is a crappy situation. I think that is way over the top.

2055
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,560
The way everybody's reacting. It's like, okay, you know,

2056
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,320
it's obvious what happened. It is wrong. GameStop should say, Hey, whoops,

2057
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,400
we didn't erase this one. You know, but at the same time, I kind of wonder like,

2058
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,960
how did,

2059
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,680
did the parents not think to look first before handing the system to their five

2060
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,240
year old? I mean,

2061
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:40,240
he says I went to go take the picture and I handed it to the five year old.

2062
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,800
How did, I'm trying to think like in having used the DS,

2063
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,040
how did he not see the pictures first then? So I don't get,

2064
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,200
you're the parents in the room.

2065
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,520
My kid would not know what porn is when he's five.

2066
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,120
And I don't think you even know what he was looking at. What's that?

2067
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,360
Exactly. I think that's what happened. That's why mine have happened.

2068
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:01,080
And then he decided, Oh, I'm going to get a case going.

2069
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,720
So this is what you say to the reporters kids,

2070
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,280
because I feel like the kids know what he saw in my opinion, in my opinion.

2071
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:12,720
This is what I think as I honestly think that it's parents thinking other people

2072
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:17,480
are doing their due diligence for them. Honestly, they say, Oh,

2073
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:21,280
it's coming in. We believe that, you know, we're not going to check.

2074
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,720
We wouldn't think about this. You know, if they were,

2075
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,680
if it was something that they were truly worried about,

2076
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,480
then they would have gone through it to begin with.

2077
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,920
And let's be honest, this is a 3DS camera, man. I'm luck.

2078
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,520
He's lucky to even know what's going on there because that camera is such a

2079
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:38,000
piece of shit that like, you'd be like, what is that? That there,

2080
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,080
I don't even know what's going on, man.

2081
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,400
Those two blobs are really close to each other. I mean, it's just, who knows?

2082
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,400
I just remember hearing from my little brothers,

2083
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,480
mommy and daddy are wrestling again.

2084
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:56,280
Or, or, or even better, you know, if they did shoot it very well, you know,

2085
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:57,240
it's like, Oh my God,

2086
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:00,680
it's like my eyes are literally being raped by the penis coming out and taking

2087
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:04,960
3d. All right. Look, a tiger call in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

2088
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,040
GameStop needs to double check their stuff.

2089
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,040
I don't think any of us are doubting that, but you know, and I'm not,

2090
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,960
I'm not exactly like giving them a break, but it's like,

2091
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:17,680
I see how this happened. Christmas rush. Someone got lazy.

2092
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,320
It slipped through. Doesn't make it right. But that's what happened clearly.

2093
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:26,080
Or sometimes if you use, um, a mass, um, formatter for a card,

2094
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,000
I've seen it happen where even for, um, camera and phone Sims, they'll,

2095
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,560
they won't do shot better. Yeah.

2096
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,480
What about the guy that returned that in the first place? I mean, don't you,

2097
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,640
I mean, honestly, if it was me returning something, I wouldn't be like, Hey,

2098
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,280
I'm gonna pull my porn on there and leave it on there. You know,

2099
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,840
it's just like, you know, when I sold my 3ds on eBay,

2100
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,960
I erased all the porn that I had on there.

2101
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:51,400
Not anything that I actually photographed, but like you can download, you know,

2102
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,840
stuff that actually goes on your card that has, you know,

2103
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,880
picture sets and stuff like that.

2104
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,920
People shot with professional 3d cameras that aren't shit like the, you know,

2105
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,800
3ds cameras.

2106
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,800
I think this is a good point that shadow next gen says in our chat room, uh,

2107
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,480
Walmart does a worse job than GameStop.

2108
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,720
It's probably very true. Uh, you know,

2109
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,440
a company that doesn't specialize in game, you know,

2110
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,560
they have a game department, but they don't specialize in games.

2111
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,360
It's probably far more likely to make that mistake. Uh,

2112
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,720
act deft closing up the story saying that kid should feel privileged.

2113
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:27,640
He had 3d porn. He just didn't realize it yet. I do all the time.

2114
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,920
He's observing the future. Speaking of Nintendo porn,

2115
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:35,880
a good segue for me to mention this, a porn app coming to the Wii U sugar DVD.

2116
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,880
They offer unlimited adult TV streaming on the PlayStation three iPad,

2117
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,320
Xbox three 60 and so forth.

2118
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,080
They've announced that they're bringing their app to the Wii U unlimited

2119
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,600
streaming porn straight to the game console, seven 95 a month.

2120
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,560
And you're probably thinking, wait a minute, how did they do this?

2121
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,120
Like I don't know this porn app on the PS three and so forth.

2122
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,000
It's launched through the web browser.

2123
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,720
So in other words, that's not much of an app.

2124
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,160
It's a website that you pay for to just get it formatted.

2125
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,720
It's like, oh, things in app to be fair.

2126
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:11,040
It it's probably looking at the user agent and stuff like that and formatting

2127
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,320
to their site. Cause I actually have the sugar DVD app on. Uh,

2128
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:18,560
it was course you do. No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Let, let me be clear.

2129
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:22,360
Let me be clear. I don't pay for porn. Okay. So, okay.

2130
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,000
So I had the app on, it came, you know,

2131
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,200
it's part of the repository for the boxy. Um, and so they have it, you know,

2132
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,560
and of course I downloaded all the porn apps and seen, you know, I was like,

2133
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:36,640
ah, got paid for this. Fuck that. Delete. But, um, you know, they had it.

2134
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,760
And so, yeah, a lot of it's thing with the boxy,

2135
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,920
the way the boxy works is it's just, you know, websites, uh,

2136
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,960
formatted for those devices. So yeah, I mean,

2137
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:49,440
I could see that they would do that. Um, and of course, Nintendo go, oh,

2138
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,960
we don't officially do this. By the way,

2139
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,840
the internet Explorer browser on the three 60 sucks for viewing porn.

2140
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,920
Just saying porn reviews by Loki. You're on,

2141
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,440
you got to know which browser is good because it doesn't support flash.

2142
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:08,040
Who the fuck doesn't support flash nowadays? All right, uh,

2143
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,520
let's go to dark Sakura. We're already,

2144
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,280
we're almost to two hours for party alone.

2145
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:16,680
Let's try to run through the rest of the work until 1130 tomorrow. Right. Um,

2146
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:20,560
to work on new year's Eve. That sucks. Yeah, but my boss won't be there.

2147
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:24,760
No, that's money. Yeah, money. That's, that's the thing. Money. Um, so anyway,

2148
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:28,040
well we've been talking and talking about this and I knew it was going to

2149
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:32,160
happen and I'm so happy steam for Linux beta is out. Yes.

2150
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:36,760
And I happen to be running Linux. I'm going to test it out.

2151
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,880
Um, basically all you have to do is, um,

2152
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,720
if you don't already have a steam account,

2153
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:46,320
you can install and register and you're in so anyone can be there.

2154
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:51,240
There's 39 games on there right now. Um, killing floor, um,

2155
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,800
the book of unwritten tales and amnesia are there

2156
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,160
and I'm actually trying to see if, uh,

2157
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,880
I can get into the site there to see what else is on.

2158
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:06,520
But I mean still, you know, it's a start.

2159
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:10,880
I think that's actually really cool and I like Linux.

2160
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:16,120
I may, uh, not have to keep using a PC anymore.

2161
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,840
So yeah, if you're interested in it, just play and you know,

2162
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,840
what's great is that steam big picture thing.

2163
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:26,520
It really does kind of just make it look like an Xbox is great. Hmm. 3d deck.

2164
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:34,360
How could you talk about that? I'm traumatized.

2165
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,920
I'm going to see boobs.

2166
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,960
I could say the sea bomb.

2167
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,640
Did you notice also when he said when they found that I called everybody I could

2168
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:49,800
think of. Yeah. The news,

2169
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:53,920
your lawyer is no games.

2170
01:41:55,440 --> 01:42:00,000
But I did make sure to transfer the pictures before we gave it back. Stop.

2171
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:00,880
All right,

2172
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:06,000
let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out to a GameStop near

2173
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,820
you.

2174
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:14,840
Boobies 3d. Not a damn thing. Nothing in the U S this week.

2175
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,360
Nothing in the U S nothing for people to spend their gift certificates on.

2176
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:19,400
Huh? Steam sale.

2177
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,240
That's the savior of gamers. That's all you get this week. Nothing new.

2178
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,440
It's just all steam stuff until, um, till the eighth,

2179
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,680
uh, going to Japan and checking out the releases there.

2180
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:36,720
Xbox three 60 nothing. PlayStation three,

2181
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,040
nothing. PlayStation Vita. Nothing.

2182
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,640
The games don't start really coming in again until January 17th.

2183
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:46,840
It looks like actually, uh, looking at the Wii U nothing.

2184
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,720
God doesn't look like there's hardly anything coming out.

2185
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:52,240
Yeah, exactly. Uh, uh, yeah,

2186
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:54,480
it looks like it is totally dry in Japan as well.

2187
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,880
So enjoy the games you have right now. I do notice though,

2188
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:02,080
there is on PlayStation two Neopets, the darkest fairy. Oh,

2189
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:05,560
that's a Europe game. It's a Europe game.

2190
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,760
That snuck my way onto the Japanese releases. All right. How about,

2191
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,720
how about Europe?

2192
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,720
Nothing until the 11th, but one of them's a Wii U game. Rob.

2193
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:18,000
What's that? Ninja Gaiden three. Okay. Ninja Gaiden three.

2194
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,560
Why did I even say it wrong? I don't know. I don't know. I was thinking of porn.

2195
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,400
Yeah.

2196
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:24,800
Three cock.

2197
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:28,080
We were at target just a couple of days before Christmas and uh,

2198
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,160
they had like 12 we use there. That's just the one up in Yuba city.

2199
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:35,640
A tower of fries. Yeah, they're everywhere. And yeah,

2200
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:36,640
they don't ship any to us.

2201
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:41,000
It's everywhere. 1200 on back order with Nintendo.

2202
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:44,040
They ship us 12. You know, it would have fuck them. You know,

2203
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:48,640
it would have sold them Africa, Tokyo jungle.

2204
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,400
All right. I need, I still need to play that. Uh,

2205
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,280
Loki myself have some stories and we're going to go to the last game of the

2206
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,480
week. Loki. Uh, see here.

2207
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,960
So this is kind of interesting. You know,

2208
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,480
there was that documentary about Minecraft called the story of Mojang and is a

2209
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,520
two player productions.

2210
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:11,320
They decided to go ahead and beat the Russian upload at the pirate bay

2211
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:15,960
themselves. So they, um, uploaded the pirate bay. Um,

2212
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:19,480
people can download it for free. They kind of, you know, said, Hey, listen,

2213
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:20,760
you know, we wanted to be,

2214
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,280
we wanted to come here first because we knew the movie would eventually end up

2215
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:28,320
here. And the best thing to do that seems to be opening a dialogue,

2216
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:32,080
torrents and piracy are way of life and it probably won't be going away anytime

2217
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,760
soon. And there are many people that want to punish you for that,

2218
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,800
but we have more realistic outlook on things. And they basically said, you know,

2219
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,440
if you download it, you know,

2220
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,520
we're just three guys trying to make a living on what we're doing.

2221
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,760
We love the world of video games and we love making it real.

2222
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,880
If you buy the movie, you support those efforts.

2223
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,640
The reason we kickstarted this movie in the first place was that we didn't have

2224
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,040
enough money to make it ourselves.

2225
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:57,360
Even then we still put a lot of our own money into it.

2226
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,960
So they're just hoping that, you know, people do buy it.

2227
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,040
You know, I did play Minecraft.

2228
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,560
Fantastic. And you know, it's ironically enough,

2229
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,600
I did not play Minecraft this week. Really? Well, I, I actually,

2230
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,680
I think I went in for a little bit cause I was fixed last week.

2231
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:17,280
I was fixing the servers cause I had screwed up the permissions by not installing

2232
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,080
the permissions client. So I kept changing the config file. I was wondering,

2233
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:24,400
why the fuck is nothing changing then? Oh, I forgot to reinstall it.

2234
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:29,040
That's funny. You know, so I was trying to do that install flans mod,

2235
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,040
but flans mod may not be coming.

2236
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:36,040
I really wanted it to happen cause that's planes, cars and guns.

2237
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,760
But so I can shoot one of those scary gray guys with the bow and arrow in the

2238
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:44,160
face. Yeah, you can do that now.

2239
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:47,080
But I'm talking about actually guns like AK47s.

2240
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:53,760
I, my, my little girl, cause I failed to skin for her, um,

2241
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,000
is making herself, um, a prairie dog town to live in.

2242
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:00,400
I'm surprised you didn't find like a shepherd model for your Minecraft

2243
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,720
character. I'm going to make one. I'm Zangief.

2244
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:06,880
Mine's just like some whatever girl one is, but I'm making a shepherd for mine.

2245
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:12,000
I did manage to update what I have. I'm doing the vog-minecraft.com.

2246
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,320
Actually has, it has a WordPress thing installed on it.

2247
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,480
I haven't bothered to update yet. I'm like starting so many projects.

2248
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:22,400
I have another project that may be 2013 that I'm not really going to talk about

2249
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,920
right now, but hopefully it'll be interesting. But, uh,

2250
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:27,440
the website is another thing I want to update.

2251
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,640
So eventually I'll get around to that. But yeah. Um, let me ask,

2252
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:34,640
let me go back to the story about leaking your own damn film onto the pirate

2253
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,080
bay. Let me ask our film guy.

2254
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,480
Obviously piracy is a bit of a problem in Hollywood, right? Yes. Um,

2255
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,400
especially when you talk about other countries, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah.

2256
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,600
It's a much bigger over there.

2257
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,800
You can go to another country and just get any movie you want. Really.

2258
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,040
You can probably go to the theater and see a movie that was pirated. Probably.

2259
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,000
Yeah. Uh, what do you think about uploading your own movie to the pirate bay?

2260
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:59,840
I don't think it's a bad idea for a movie like this because what other exposure

2261
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,560
are they going to get?

2262
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,160
Maybe a lot of documentaries sign Netflix deals and I don't know how that works.

2263
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,320
I don't know how the money transaction works,

2264
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:10,080
but if these guys put it up on the pirate bay and they put like, like Loki said,

2265
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:14,000
a message on there saying, Hey, please give us money. People might donate to that.

2266
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,920
The guilt thing. What is it? It's not even really a guilt thing.

2267
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:19,960
It's more of like, you know, Hey, you know,

2268
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,840
they're actually coming out and saying, Hey,

2269
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,320
it's almost like you if they did the pay what you want model,

2270
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:27,040
which actually probably would have been a better way to do it. But you know,

2271
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,680
once again, people are always going to pirate stuff.

2272
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,920
They did some similar with McPixel was a game that got put onto the pirate bay

2273
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,920
and he actually,

2274
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,280
he uploaded it to the pirate bay and basically said, okay, you know,

2275
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,680
we're going to do this. You know, you pay me what you want for it.

2276
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:45,320
I think it's worth $5, but you know, you tell me what you,

2277
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,880
what you think it's worth and you pay me that or nothing. And so I,

2278
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:52,960
from what I remember, I think he made actually quite a bit of money from that.

2279
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,440
Um, you know, it turned out very well and I think that's kind of the way it seems

2280
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:57,920
like, you know,

2281
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,600
a lot of these pay what you want things like the humble bundles and stuff do

2282
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,840
really well and they get probably a lot more money than they would have if they

2283
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,120
try to sell everything individually. Um,

2284
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:09,440
act depth in our chat room at live.vog network.com says it's not guilt.

2285
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:14,520
It's supporting something you like. Fair enough. And, and I haven't watched it,

2286
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,400
but the trailer looked really good for it. I mean,

2287
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,320
it looked like a pretty awesome documentary. It's nice.

2288
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,880
I still need to watch the indie game movie from the humble bundle that I have.

2289
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,520
I wanted to watch that anyway. So, Hmm. All right, well, uh,

2290
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:29,640
let me get one more story here for you guys and we'll get to the classic game of

2291
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,200
the week. But, um, you know, the Wii U game tank tank tank,

2292
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,640
which actually is based on an arcade game,

2293
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,480
which is funny that you're so excited about it because the games were getting

2294
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,720
shit reviews left and right. Like people do not like it.

2295
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:43,120
I don't care about the Wii U when I care about the arcade one,

2296
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:43,960
which is awesome.

2297
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:45,720
But you know,

2298
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,800
I guess trying to sell an arcade game for 60 bucks like that,

2299
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,800
like something you're used to playing a quarter for and getting your,

2300
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,320
or maybe a little quarter. Yeah. This day and age,

2301
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:56,640
four quarters for to get your five minute throw and then you're done with it.

2302
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,080
You know, trying to get somebody to pay 60 bucks. That might be asking a lot. Um,

2303
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:02,400
and I guess in Japan it hasn't been selling well.

2304
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:07,040
Here's kind of an interesting thing that Namco is doing. This is only Japan,

2305
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:07,920
but who knows?

2306
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,520
It could happen here because I don't think it's selling that any better here.

2307
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,200
Tank tank tank is now free to play in a way.

2308
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,680
It's kind of a different type of model.

2309
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,880
You download the upgradeable demo in the Japanese Nintendo eShop.

2310
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,960
So what you can do if you're in Japan, you download this demo,

2311
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:27,240
you get the basic action game for free. It has multiplayer.

2312
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,080
You can do the city map free for all team battle giant monster,

2313
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:35,160
but if you download the free version, you can only play it three times a day.

2314
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,840
That restriction is removed.

2315
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,680
If you purchase any download content for the game,

2316
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,680
if you want to get more parts of this upgradeable demo,

2317
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:45,920
you have to get these offered download contents in the game.

2318
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,160
This is very iPhone. The way this is working out here,

2319
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:56,120
like the, all it is the whole playing it three times daily.

2320
01:49:56,360 --> 01:50:00,720
That's your little three energy pills. And if you want more energy pills,

2321
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:03,440
go buy them on the store or whatever. Like this is just,

2322
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:08,480
this is literally the iPhone pricing model on a launch

2323
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,720
title for the game. Now in the Nintendo Wii U shop. Very interesting.

2324
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:15,920
I'm a little cautious with Namco doing it because remember Ridge Racer on the

2325
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,800
Vita and how wonderful that was, you know?

2326
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,360
Well, you kind of hope that maybe they learned something from that whole

2327
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:21,520
experience.

2328
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:25,120
I certainly hope so because God, that was,

2329
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:30,040
that was a fucking mess. Um, but Tang Tang Tank's pretty awesome.

2330
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:30,920
But yeah, looking at,

2331
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:33,600
I can see why the reviews haven't been that good on it because it seemed like

2332
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:37,120
the game was very limited as what they, what they're offering.

2333
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,720
Cause I mean in an arcade game it would be, it makes sense that, okay,

2334
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,960
you get like maybe an hour of entertainment out of it if you're really playing a

2335
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,200
lot of money into it. But you know, this is a console game,

2336
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:50,080
so you've got to have a lot more to it.

2337
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:54,600
Otherwise you're going to get really bored. Um, so I don't know.

2338
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:58,800
It's, which reminds me, I need to really go back and play a, that was it,

2339
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:02,720
uh, say a gun game. Uh,

2340
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,880
what was that called? I don't remember now.

2341
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:07,560
Say good gun game. Yeah.

2342
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:11,240
There is a Sega gun game that I was really raving about a while back. It's an old,

2343
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,560
uh, it's not, not super old. It's not one of the virtual games. It's uh,

2344
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:20,040
God, I can't fucking remember now. It's just a really wacky game. Um,

2345
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,000
all right, well maybe somebody in chat will read your mind. Um,

2346
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:28,160
but I think this makes a very interesting sort of compliment to the last story

2347
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:31,080
you talked about. I mean they may not be putting tank tank tank up on the pirate

2348
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:33,760
bay, but essentially they're putting it on a place where they're saying, Hey,

2349
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,720
download it for free and let's see what happens because I bet you a lot more

2350
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,040
people now will play tank tank tank go squad.

2351
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:43,080
It was the game I was thinking of pretty cool. It's, but see,

2352
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,800
that game has a lot of replay. I mean it's a very short game,

2353
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,840
but you unlock weapons and the weapons increase the difficulty.

2354
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:53,120
And so it was fun. Let's go back to my point though, is that, you know,

2355
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:56,160
way more people are going to play this game than probably would have before.

2356
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:00,440
Right? Yeah, because now it's free and so are basically checking out and there's

2357
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:03,760
going to be maybe a handful of people like, Oh yeah, this is kind of fun.

2358
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,120
And I probably wouldn't have bought this, but you know what?

2359
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,440
And even though the three times,

2360
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,160
I understand why they're limiting the gameplay cause they're giving you quite a

2361
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:16,280
bit of the game and that seems kind of lame even though it is a demo and stuff.

2362
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,880
But I understand why they're doing that. But at the same time, it's,

2363
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,640
it's kind of cool that they are offering that.

2364
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:25,040
So a lot more people can actually check out the game.

2365
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:29,880
A fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says these days wait three

2366
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:33,360
months to buy a game and you can spend the same amount to get the add ons.

2367
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:37,640
They're like $60 worth of costumes and DOA five worth.

2368
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:40,920
That's how much they cost. So not worth that.

2369
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,160
I did that for, um, puzzle bobble on iPhone.

2370
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:45,880
It just saying,

2371
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:49,760
and also the three times a day is way better than when they limit it to like 30

2372
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,400
plays done. You know, that type of thing. Rayman legends.

2373
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,040
Haven't forbid if they did that to the Nino Cooney demo. I mean,

2374
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,680
Flaco would have worn it out by now.

2375
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,480
I already have worn it out.

2376
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,920
All right, so there you go. Tank tank tank going free to play in Japan.

2377
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,200
Who knows? Keep an eye on the news that that could happen here.

2378
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:10,480
Especially if they have success with it in Japan. We'll see. All right,

2379
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:13,600
let's travel back to a time when you know what? There was no free to play.

2380
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:18,600
You, you paid the 50, 60 bucks for this game and either you liked it or F you.

2381
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:25,800
Yay. I'm in chat. Oh, did, did the G line get lifted? Yeah.

2382
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:29,000
That's been an hour. We should be able to safely reconnect to chat.

2383
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:34,760
All right. Someone tell, no, we can't all five do it. No, I mean,

2384
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,320
that's all right. I'll just be on my phone. My phone. Fine.

2385
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:46,560
The classic name of the week is Jairus.

2386
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:53,520
You mean I have a YouTube of it. I know, but I always have to,

2387
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:56,760
it's so freaking cool.

2388
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,280
I love this game.

2389
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:15,440
You know, play to cut and you can be minor Rob one. Exactly.

2390
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:24,560
So Jairus is a shoot him up game that if you've

2391
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,040
played, um, Tempest,

2392
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:31,040
you may find the game play style very familiar because you go in a circle.

2393
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:37,360
It was the last game that Yoshiki Okamoto did for Konami. Um,

2394
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,800
the first one being time pilot and, um,

2395
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,520
he was fired after the game was released and he went to doing Capcom where he

2396
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,080
gave us, Oh,

2397
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:50,080
just a couple of little obscure titles like 1942 and street fighter,

2398
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,560
you know? So, um, this one basically you're moving around in a circle,

2399
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:00,800
hence I guess Jairus and shooting things as they come from the background to

2400
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,340
the foreground. Like I said,

2401
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:06,760
I'm again comparing it to Tempest because I think that Tempest was, uh,

2402
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:11,400
definitely inspired by that. So, um,

2403
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,680
and also, like I said, that it actually, um,

2404
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:17,920
does play an arrangement of Takata and Fuegan D minor,

2405
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:23,440
which I'm sure the Vanessa Mae fans in chat recognize that one from her version

2406
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:27,240
of it, if not, you know, actually paying attention to classical music, you know?

2407
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:31,120
So, um, it was, uh,

2408
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,520
actually using stereo sound and, um,

2409
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,520
in the bonus material that's for the Konami arcade classic,

2410
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:41,480
they said that they used it by, um, using different, um, audio circuits.

2411
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:42,920
The game was, uh,

2412
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:46,520
used a multi-core processor that had two Z80 microprocessors,

2413
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:50,680
a 6809 microprocessor and an 8039 microprocessor.

2414
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:56,160
For the sound, it used an AY3-8910 PSG sound chip and a DAC.

2415
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,000
For those who are into the technical side of it.

2416
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:03,680
So again, it's a cylinder,

2417
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:06,440
you shoot stuff when they come at you, you've got, you know,

2418
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,040
swirly things that come at you. Um, if, uh,

2419
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,480
you don't get the enemies in time,

2420
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,120
the enemies that you have are satellites,

2421
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,120
asteroids and laser beam generators,

2422
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:20,720
and they just show up and some of them disappear if you don't shoot them first.

2423
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,960
So, uh, for, uh, other things you have with the asteroids,

2424
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:29,120
they actually fly out from the center, um, relatively, you know,

2425
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:33,440
regularly and you still have to shoot them. Then you actually get, um,

2426
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:34,880
a, uh,

2427
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,480
you have to like make it to different planets as you're going through the

2428
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:43,040
different stages. So you'll, um, like at first it says two warps to Neptune's,

2429
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:46,520
you have to go through a warp and each warp is your stage. And then, um,

2430
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,920
after you land on the planet,

2431
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:51,920
you get a bonus round where you have to shoot different ships for bonus points,

2432
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:54,480
kind of like, um, Galaga or Galaxian.

2433
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:59,200
And you basically go through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and finally Earth,

2434
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,440
where you've got three warps to get to each planet. Stage one,

2435
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,200
and every 10th stage afterwards,

2436
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:07,240
the enemies will not fire on you when you enter the screen.

2437
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:10,680
Guess what the video just said? What? One warp to Uranus.

2438
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:17,880
So as far as its arcade release, um,

2439
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:21,720
it had an upright and cocktail cabinets, cocktail machines are the best I swear.

2440
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:27,000
It, um, saved the high scores in RAM. Um,

2441
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,280
but there was a mod kit that was released on August 22nd, um,

2442
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:34,680
2003 that would save the top five scores after the machine was powered off.

2443
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,480
So you could actually save the score machine.

2444
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:40,600
That would be a great name for a video game blog. Three warps to Uranus.

2445
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,240
I'm sorry. Patent pending.

2446
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,480
Jairus was, um,

2447
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,120
if we ever,

2448
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:50,640
if we ever go our separate ways and have to make new podcasts,

2449
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:53,280
my next podcast can be called three warps to Uranus.

2450
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,880
Jairus was ported to different early systems.

2451
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:02,560
There was a version on Atari, 2650, 200, which I think I've got that one.

2452
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:07,600
The, um, Atari eight bit, the Commodore 64 Rob and the clique of vision.

2453
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:12,040
Can we hear the awesome Commodore 64 SID chip version of Takata?

2454
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,280
I guess as long as we can go back to the old one.

2455
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:15,280
Yes.

2456
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,600
Wait. Oh, that wasn't the full thing. Hold on. Look at that. Oh man.

2457
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,400
The Commodore 64 version of this is so good. Why is the light flickering?

2458
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,240
Is that concerning?

2459
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,760
This is the version I play. It's like nonstop. I love this game.

2460
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:55,880
Okay. Sorry. Play the remix. Remember that showed up in, um,

2461
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:59,080
beat mania. I can do that. I was going to do that during the break. Okay.

2462
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,760
We'll just do it in break. That means everyone's still listening to the break.

2463
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:03,640
Okay. Um,

2464
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:07,440
there wasn't a support version that was basically a very faithful arcade

2465
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:11,480
reproduction. Um, it actually has some changes,

2466
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:15,160
but the really faithful version came up with the economy arcade classics for

2467
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:19,320
PlayStation and the economy collector series at arcade advance for Game Boy

2468
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:23,400
advance. There are different bootleg versions. There's one called Venus.

2469
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:29,400
Um, there is a one called Enu that was done by Italian hackers,

2470
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:33,360
which I guess it had more scooters, more Vespas,

2471
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,560
and people going chow.

2472
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:44,280
They are working on trying to, uh, restore versions on main.

2473
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,360
So, um, there's actually,

2474
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:52,400
and this is what pisses me off about how awesome everything came out on the

2475
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,880
Famicom desk system. Uh,

2476
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Jairus was one of the games that was a Famicom desk and it had a neat looking

2477
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:05,640
logo, had the Konami logo over the top and it had spaceship and earth and

2478
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,480
everything.

2479
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:11,280
And then ultra games brought out a version that was kind of, but,

2480
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,400
um,

2481
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:17,520
I think it was, but I thought it was pretty good for an NPS.

2482
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:19,680
I'm talking about logo Rob. Oh,

2483
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:24,440
but what happened though with it is it updated the graphics. Um,

2484
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:29,280
the music in the arcade version was from the arcade version was slightly

2485
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,880
remixed. There were additional tracks. Um,

2486
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:34,320
you start off with three warp synapse instead of two warps.

2487
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:37,440
You get a super phaser attack instead of with the normal gun. Sorry.

2488
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:40,840
You have extra enemies, boss fights, bonus stages,

2489
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:45,600
an ending to the game and in the nest version it says something about the

2490
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:48,960
universe being at peace. Um, in the Famicom desk system,

2491
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,560
you get a full ending sequence. How's that? Um,

2492
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:57,400
you've got 39 looping stages instead of the 24 and um,

2493
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:00,560
on the nest version you actually play through the entire solar system,

2494
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:05,000
including the sun and Pluto. The Konami code will work for extra lives.

2495
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,200
However you have to enter it in reverse. So a, b, a, b, right, left, right, left,

2496
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:13,240
down, down, up, up instead of the, you know what happens? A bit of trivia.

2497
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:17,560
If you do the regular Konami code in Proteus, it kills you. Yeah,

2498
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:20,680
I think it does. If you do it in reverse, then you do it gyro style.

2499
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:24,240
I think it does that in, um, um, Gradius four, I think.

2500
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,400
Yeah. Um,

2501
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:32,120
that version of the game is also included in the Majesco, um, TV game, Konami,

2502
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:36,520
uh, collector series, not the, um, Game Boy advanced ones.

2503
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:41,080
So as far as other modern versions come out, like I said, there were, um,

2504
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,920
the Game Boy advanced version, the PlayStation one. Um,

2505
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:46,320
you can get it on, um, Xbox live arcade.

2506
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:49,520
It's a tiger, tiger con chat. It says they should remake gyrus,

2507
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,120
like same gameplay style, but HD graphics. I'm like, it's on Xbox.

2508
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:55,840
You might've missed it.

2509
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:59,480
So is for anyone who's interested in other games that I've covered,

2510
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:04,840
our type is available that way. And it's really fun. Um, also,

2511
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,120
um,

2512
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:11,120
there's a clone of the game that exists as a mini game in Grand Theft Auto,

2513
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:15,480
San Andreas. And like we've mentioned earlier, dance dance revolution,

2514
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:18,320
ultra mix two, there is a gyrus, a remix,

2515
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,480
and it's also available on in,

2516
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:26,680
in game room for Xbox 360 and windows based PCs. So there you go.

2517
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:32,640
Gyrus, there it is folks by the person who gave us street fighter.

2518
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,080
I do have a, like a sort Konami side story based on that.

2519
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,440
Oh, it was just, um, we,

2520
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:43,000
we have our little weekly meetings and they talk about upcoming games that we're

2521
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,320
going to come into the test and one of them was time pirate and we're like time

2522
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:52,520
pirate. What's that? We never heard of that game before. And, uh,

2523
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:56,280
so then the next week the correction came in like, Oh, it was time pilot.

2524
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,160
But of course we get these notes from Japan.

2525
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:03,040
The moment you said that I was like, time pilot guy,

2526
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:06,280
you had a room full of gamers. All of us were like, time pirate. Oh,

2527
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:10,880
that sounds cool. Yeah. But it's the same. Yeah. It's the same guy.

2528
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,480
That's why as soon as you mentioned that I was like, Oh,

2529
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:15,920
that totally reminds me of that story where we all were stupid for,

2530
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I always keep forgetting that it's the same,

2531
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:22,200
the same person did the 1942 and Street Fighter. So, I mean,

2532
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:26,280
that's sort of the big tie in, you know, as a whole series of, you know,

2533
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:27,480
classic games right there.

2534
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:32,600
I like finding the awesome people that installed so much of my childhood. Yeah.

2535
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:33,440
That is pretty cool.

2536
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:39,320
I spent a lot of time on a gyrus when I was much younger and not paying for

2537
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:44,040
school. Paid with my sanity maybe.

2538
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:49,840
All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week. Gyrus, uh,

2539
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:53,640
don't go anywhere guys. We've got more of orange launch radio to come. Uh,

2540
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:55,200
part B is going to be a little different this week.

2541
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,400
We're going to do rapid fire news and then we're going to, uh,

2542
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,680
not do any more news after that. We're going to do some discussions.

2543
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:02,560
We're going to do top game of the week, disappointing game. I'm sorry.

2544
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:07,040
Top game of the week. Top game of 2012, disappointing game of 2012.

2545
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:11,040
Fugu question of the week, mailbag, lots of stuff coming up after the break and,

2546
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:14,280
and no 3d cock. Well,

2547
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,040
we don't want to traumatize any of the younger listeners even though this is not

2548
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:20,160
a show for kids. Turn off the radio. If you're a five year old, you're listening.

2549
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,400
Um, also tonight,

2550
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:27,520
listless last listless of the year with our 2013 predictions in gaming.

2551
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,000
Oh boy.

2552
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:34,720
We'll be right back after this with more of orange lounge radio.

2553
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:45,560
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live with our last show of the

2554
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:50,560
year, episode 487 for this December the 30th of 2012 and we're going to get into

2555
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:56,800
some of our favorite games of the year and things we weren't so thrilled with

2556
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:59,880
this year as is customary to do on a year end special.

2557
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:04,160
It's our totally cliche year end special coming up a little later,

2558
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:06,800
but first we're going to travel around and get some rapid fire news.

2559
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:09,840
The last news of the year that we're going to talk about. Loki.

2560
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,080
All right,

2561
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:15,840
so let's talk a little bit about tomb Raider and like any other game that's

2562
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:18,960
coming out, they have to shoehorn multiplayer in there.

2563
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,400
So that's what they did.

2564
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,920
They confirm that it will have multiplayer and cool.

2565
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:27,560
I'm trying to remain optimistic about it.

2566
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:29,760
Multiplayer worked out very well for mass effect three.

2567
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:34,520
I saw assassin creed threes multiplayer, uh, over the Christmas holiday. Um,

2568
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:37,520
when we were watching somebody else play it, it looked interesting. I was like,

2569
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:41,800
oh, that looks kind of fun to play. So multiplayer is not all bad. Yeah.

2570
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:47,000
Um, of course there is the humble indie bundle seven that was out.

2571
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,640
Now of course, like they do with most of the humble indie bundles,

2572
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:53,000
they add stuff to it. So now if you pay over the average,

2573
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:57,200
you get dungeon defenders, um, plus the DLC legends of grim rock,

2574
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:02,080
the basement collection, offspring fling and cave story plus,

2575
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:06,560
which is not bad. And yeah, I had to pick it up. Cave story is awesome. Yeah.

2576
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,280
So yeah, but it was also in a prior humble bundle, but that's all right.

2577
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:12,840
That's all right. It's this is a case. Oh yeah. I don't know.

2578
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:16,920
Keeps her plus it was it. Yeah. Yes it was. Which one was it then?

2579
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:20,840
They had that two years ago I think. Yes it was. It wasn't six.

2580
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:23,800
It was four or five had it. Really? Yep. Really?

2581
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:26,280
Cause I've bought all of them since like,

2582
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:29,760
probably you better check your steam library again.

2583
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:32,000
You probably have cave story you just forgot.

2584
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:37,560
Problem of steam sales is I forgot I own this seriously.

2585
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:41,800
I just bought another copy. No, I don't have it. So

2586
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:45,840
I know that mine also gives me like a little indicator to say if I've already

2587
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:49,040
bought a game. If I can get like a separate code, I'll just give you mine. Oh no.

2588
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,520
You bought the humble bundle, right? Yeah.

2589
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,760
Thankfully they're all separate so I can get rid of this.

2590
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:56,640
Like there was one I bought. Oh I got yet another copy.

2591
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:59,320
I swear to God I'm like handling the bundle for,

2592
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:03,840
I'm swimming in copies of Metro 2033. It's like I have like four of them.

2593
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:07,920
It's ridiculous. Um, but anyways, uh, so yeah,

2594
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:11,640
humble bundle. It's awesome. She definitely pick it up and you know,

2595
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,440
they've got the indie game, the movie in there,

2596
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:16,960
shank and all that fun stuff and case or plus if you haven't played it,

2597
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,200
like I haven't played it yet. Um,

2598
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:23,320
there's going to be a lot of indie game playing in 2013.

2599
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:27,320
That one also came with super me, boy, shank and bitcher runner.

2600
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:32,840
Quiet, be quiet. Really? Cause I swear I got that one. Maybe I did.

2601
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:37,360
Oh, I'll look it up while I'm doing so. Anyways, um, and the last but not least,

2602
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:40,720
the first piece of DLC is going to be coming out to call of duty.

2603
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:44,360
Black ops is came from a leaked sign from, I'm,

2604
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:47,160
what can I assume probably like a game stop or something like that.

2605
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,760
It's called call of duty black ops two revolution.

2606
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:54,600
It's gonna include five maps, one of which is a zombie maps. They have hydro.

2607
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:59,280
Um, looks like a dam downhill, which is a ski resort.

2608
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:04,760
Uh, grind, which I can't really see in this picture at all.

2609
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:08,080
They had a better, better picture when those on here. Um,

2610
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:13,400
let's see. Oh, here we go. Okay. So, um,

2611
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:18,040
grind, which appears to be like a, um,

2612
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:22,400
a skate park or something, which is kind of cool. A mirage,

2613
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:25,280
which looks like a maybe like an Asian environment.

2614
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:28,640
They got a lot of pagodas in the background and die rise,

2615
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:30,640
which is a zombie map on a high rise.

2616
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,200
Plus they also give you this bonus peacekeeper, a sub machine gun,

2617
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:37,800
apparently coming out on the 29th of January.

2618
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:42,400
And it's supposed to be exclusive, I think for the Xbox three 60 for awhile,

2619
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:46,000
which makes sense. They've been doing that in the last few call of duty games.

2620
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,240
Um, I'm kind of excited about it.

2621
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:50,280
I'm looking forward to some new maps cause we're kinda,

2622
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,800
we played out the ones on a black ops.

2623
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:56,120
Although I'm also looking forward to the rest of my coworkers fucking getting

2624
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:59,400
that game so I can play with more than just one other person cause it's kind of

2625
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:03,760
annoying. We're all in modern warfare three and yeah,

2626
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:08,000
I had to kick their ass on Friday and so I won the year. Um,

2627
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:08,920
so yeah, that's it.

2628
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,520
All right, well I have a few news stories for you too.

2629
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:17,040
And uh, one of them is another retro collection coming to iOS and uh, you know,

2630
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:20,480
iPads and iPhones and all that good stuff. And uh, very interesting.

2631
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:24,400
It's an info com collection. Uh, you may not remember that name,

2632
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,960
but they did all the classic text adventure games back in the day.

2633
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:31,240
Like Zork, Zork two, Zork three. Uh,

2634
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:34,320
I believe hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy was one of their games too.

2635
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:37,720
It's not in this, it's not in this bundle though. I thought it was on there.

2636
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:41,000
Yeah. And Chanter's in there. Infidel. I remember that one. Uh,

2637
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:43,320
planet fall witness. Yep. Wish bringer.

2638
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:48,320
So anyhow we're spouting off all these names of games that are in the info com

2639
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:52,640
bundle, uh, 27 classic adventure games, but it is $10.

2640
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:56,200
Like a lot of these collections, you can get the core app for free.

2641
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:59,440
The free one will come with Zork one. So you get that for free.

2642
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:02,840
You can be eaten by a grew to your heart's content. Uh,

2643
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:06,800
after that you can get five packs of games for three bucks a piece or you just

2644
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,840
get everything for 10 bucks. You can also,

2645
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:12,840
for I think a dollar by these things called Invisi clues.

2646
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,720
They're the hint booklets for the games.

2647
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,920
I have not checked out this collection myself,

2648
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:20,120
but I'm told that they have like compasses and some additional features that you

2649
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:25,120
didn't have back when it was just text on a Apple two E or a Commodore system,

2650
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:28,400
you know, when they didn't have anything besides that. But you know,

2651
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:32,600
it's fun for like five minutes and then you realize, boy, games got a lot,

2652
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:34,480
you know, better. All right. Uh,

2653
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:36,080
Nintendo powers.

2654
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:41,080
Last issue ranked the top 285 Nintendo games of all time.

2655
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:44,880
285 and you might ask why such a weird number? Well,

2656
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:48,240
that's because there were 285 issues made of Nintendo power.

2657
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:53,560
So that goes all the way from 285 superstar Wars on the super Nintendo.

2658
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:57,760
Not a bad choice, although maybe should be a little higher all the way to number

2659
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,880
one. What is,

2660
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:02,600
what does Nintendo power believe was the best Nintendo game ever made?

2661
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:06,840
Thoughts don't look regular Nintendo or super Nintendo, any Nintendo platform,

2662
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:08,320
but it had to be on a Nintendo platform.

2663
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:12,480
Best game ever made on a Nintendo platform. Super Mario Brothers. Uh,

2664
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:16,480
that was number, the original Mario brothers was number 16.

2665
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:21,640
Linked to the past. Linked to the past was number two. Super Mario world.

2666
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:24,800
If that was number two, then I'm going to say Ocarina was number one.

2667
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,960
Oh, Ocarina time was number one. The number one ever rated game.

2668
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:34,040
Uh, the, if it's so funny, if you look at the top 10, okay.

2669
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:37,200
Top 10, 10 resident evil four on the game cube,

2670
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:41,600
nine Zelda Wind Waker, eight super Metroid.

2671
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,480
It should have been one, seven Mario, three, six mega man,

2672
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:50,520
two, five Mario world, four final fantasy,

2673
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:54,240
three or six, three super Mario galaxy,

2674
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:58,680
two Zelda linked to the past, one Zelda Ocarina of time,

2675
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:03,120
Zelda Rina of time, Zelda Rina, where's Mario? Her name is Zelda Rina.

2676
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:07,200
Eleven is skyward sword. 12 is the original legend of Zelda.

2677
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:10,000
If you look at the top 16,

2678
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:14,920
they are all Mario and Zelda games with the exception of eight super

2679
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:17,960
Metroid, six mega man, two, four, five, Nancy three.

2680
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:22,240
And get this at number 13, this surprised me. Elite beat agents.

2681
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:26,360
Where's secret of mana? Secret of mana. Good question.

2682
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:32,120
Secret of 88. Fuck them.

2683
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:35,800
Yeah. I was going to say, what about earth? All right.

2684
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:38,840
This is the last one I'm looking at. Oh, I didn't really V, V, V, V, V, V.

2685
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:42,280
Was on the list at number 99. That's pretty good. Uh, all right.

2686
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,600
I'm looking up earthbound. Uh, let's see.

2687
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:50,120
Oh, earth, earthworm Jim at number 200.

2688
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:54,080
Let's see earthbound one 56. Secret of mana. Beat it out.

2689
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:57,160
Between maniac mansion and final fantasy five advance.

2690
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:59,760
This I'll just games released in the U S right. Well, look,

2691
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:03,160
let's just say there's a reason that they pulled the plug on that magazine and

2692
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:07,960
that list will demonstrate it. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Kidding. God,

2693
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,280
stop getting angry. All right. Cut a bitch. All right. Uh,

2694
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:16,040
one other thing for you guys, did you know that not only is the Wii U region

2695
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:18,760
locked, but the game pads are region locked as well.

2696
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:24,120
Here's the thing. If you actually try to bring like a, uh,

2697
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:27,880
another regions, we, you, uh, pad and hook it up or whatever,

2698
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:30,600
when it tries to do the console updates,

2699
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:34,880
it'll actually tell you the update cannot be completed with an overseas Wii U

2700
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:38,280
game pad. I don't know why the fuck anyone would ever need this.

2701
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:41,720
Like why would you be using some other regions game pad for when they

2702
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:44,080
inevitably do fun colors in Japan that we don't have?

2703
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:48,040
But then you'll have your own when you buy the unit, you'll have your own.

2704
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:52,560
How many spice colored game cube pads do I have?

2705
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:54,520
I think this is a little ridiculous to get angry over.

2706
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:57,600
Let's get angry over the fact that the Wii U itself is not region locked.

2707
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:01,000
That's where we should be focused on. It is region locked. I know. Right.

2708
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:04,440
That's what we should be focused on. It is not. Huh? You said it's not bad.

2709
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:07,960
It is regional. Well, let's be mad. Let's just be mad. Let's just be mad at Rob.

2710
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:13,880
Anyhow. Uh, yeah. I mean, if, if whatever, okay.

2711
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:16,480
And then the people are saying, well,

2712
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:20,720
what if someday the games do support two game pads and you have a friend from

2713
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:21,520
Europe over

2714
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:28,200
fucking get over it. God, then you just fucking get over it. That's what you do.

2715
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:29,800
You suck it up and you get over it.

2716
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:35,360
Then you don't play that game. Yeah, exactly. You write an angry, you,

2717
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:38,000
you know what? You write another angry article on the internet.

2718
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:41,680
That's what you do. You go and post it to your three ones.

2719
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:49,120
Dark Sakura. What do you have for us? Last stories of the year. Okay. Well,

2720
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:54,160
Super Mario brothers three is going to be on the 3DS virtual console in Japan.

2721
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:58,800
It's coming out in the new year and uh,

2722
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:01,640
we don't really know when it's going to come out over here, but it's 500 yen.

2723
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:03,960
Yay. What?

2724
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:09,200
I heard an intake of breath as if you were going to add something to my comment

2725
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:11,120
before I move on to the story about dirt bikes.

2726
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:15,320
I just wanted to mention something to Rob and the reason why that, you know,

2727
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:17,840
we should probably discount this list. The guardian legend is not on it.

2728
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:22,280
What? This is why your magazine went bankrupt. I'm sorry.

2729
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:25,800
Burn the infidels. Hashtag, hashtag. Sorry. Not sorry.

2730
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:28,800
The guardian legends not on it. Neither is excite trucks. So you know what?

2731
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:31,560
Fuck that. The best racing game and I think launch.

2732
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:36,640
Two 86, two 87. Go, go figure. We sports resort.

2733
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:38,160
Sharp stick eyeball.

2734
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:44,520
So guess what's coming to battlefield three since I just mentioned a second ago,

2735
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:49,880
dirt bikes, but no Camaro's. They are going to be adding offered dirt, uh,

2736
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:55,320
dirt bikes, mechanized and mechanized horses to battlefield three for the fifth

2737
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:00,920
mini expansion and game and new maps and capture the flag will be out.

2738
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:06,520
Then there will be lightweight double a vehicles and new trooper drops that will

2739
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:10,600
poop troops all over. And last but not least,

2740
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:16,440
there's a trailer for a game that people are losing their shit about lightning

2741
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:17,280
returns.

2742
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:22,160
That's what Rob sounds like on the toilet when he loses his shit.

2743
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:27,360
You're disgusting. You were the one who lost your shit.

2744
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:33,040
So final fantasy 13, lightning returns. Um,

2745
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:37,760
basically it looks kind of like assassin's creed kind of a style play with, um,

2746
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:41,600
final fantasy people in it. Okay, I'm done.

2747
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:47,480
All right. And that's what I said when I saw, you know, lightning returns.

2748
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:50,680
I'm like, I don't even care. I'll buy it. I'm not even gonna try and lie.

2749
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:54,880
Of course. Rob's our consumer horn. I have the other two. All right.

2750
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:57,600
Uh, that's it for news. Uh,

2751
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:00,240
but we do have some other things we want to talk about, uh,

2752
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:01,960
before the show is over,

2753
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:06,920
we want to get to 2012 in review and this is where I would use your usually play

2754
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:09,440
like a bumper or something. I don't really have any bumper or music.

2755
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:12,400
So actually when in doubt, just play dancer.

2756
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:17,320
For some reason, you know, it was probably in my head. It would have been fun.

2757
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:21,600
The level music from super Mario 64.

2758
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:26,200
All right, whatever. Top game of 2012.

2759
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:29,040
It's time to figure out what our top games of the year are. Now.

2760
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:29,880
Here's the thing.

2761
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:35,000
The question that we are really asking is what is your

2762
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:38,760
top game of 2012? Because we don't want to get into that hole. You're wrong.

2763
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:40,440
You pick the wrong game in it. Nope.

2764
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:45,360
There's no right or wrong answer to what your or my top game of 2012

2765
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:50,080
is. Can't be wrong. They're just stupid. Exactly. Exactly. Uh, so we'll, um,

2766
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:53,320
uh, get to this in the frugal question of the week in a minute as well,

2767
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:57,880
but we want to talk about what was your top game of 2012 and why

2768
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:00,760
we're going to start with the person who, uh,

2769
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,720
is going to be the most completely obvious with this.

2770
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:06,360
Let's start with dark Sakura Mass Effect three. Duh. And why?

2771
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:08,120
Garris.

2772
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:12,280
Of course. And is there anything else you really, I mean,

2773
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:15,920
you just started getting this year apart from that. Well,

2774
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:19,120
I started playing Mass Effect three, what two months after it came out,

2775
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:22,080
after I'd beaten the other two. Um, the,

2776
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:25,360
there's a lot going on it that I like apart from just the stories and the

2777
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:29,000
character development and the fact that you basically are building your head

2778
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,480
cannon can be real in the game.

2779
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:35,160
But the other thing that I like is modding the hell out of my shepherd and

2780
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:38,440
tweaking the game and figuring out how I can push boundaries in it.

2781
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:42,560
And I think I finally figured out how to get all the high res, um,

2782
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:44,080
textures to work in Mass Effect three.

2783
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:48,960
So that's going to be for my seventh playthrough. And it's, it's really like,

2784
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,080
I made an albino shepherd. I made a blue shepherd.

2785
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:53,760
It's the modding is so much fun for me.

2786
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:57,920
I will spend three hours working on getting my character to look right before I

2787
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:02,840
even do a mission. So it's, it's like having a girl,

2788
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:06,800
shut up. It's like having the Sims and then actually having a good game.

2789
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:11,920
So fair enough. And, and Garris,

2790
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:15,080
Shakerion, Shakerion. It's Shakerion Sunday.

2791
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:20,520
I posted a picture on mass effecting.tumblr.com.

2792
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:24,680
When's, when's, when's, is Shenko Saturday or what's, I guess so.

2793
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:29,600
Shenko's every other day. No. Um, but, but, but it said Shakerion,

2794
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:32,240
deal with it. All right. Uh, let's,

2795
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:35,600
let's do some of the ones that are going to be a little less obvious. Um,

2796
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:38,480
let's go to our guest Flaco Jones and then we're going to do Alan as well.

2797
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:42,720
Flaco Jones. Uh, for best game. Yeah. Your favorite. What's your,

2798
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:46,520
your personal top game of 2012? I kinda, you know,

2799
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:49,200
I had to make a decision cause I played two really great games this week,

2800
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:53,280
but I'm going to stick with the walking dead just because I just love the story

2801
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:57,960
and I love how everything you do in the game comes back and, and it made,

2802
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:01,720
it all mattered. So it was a great game and it, you know,

2803
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:03,480
not terribly long and a pretty good deal.

2804
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:05,180
Like I know you guys are saying you got for 10 bucks.

2805
02:20:05,180 --> 02:20:09,280
I got it for 20 and I still feel like that was a great deal because it's about

2806
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:14,160
two to three hours a chapter and you got five chapters. So that can 10,

2807
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:17,960
15 hours for 20 bucks. I think it's pretty good. 10 bucks. Even better.

2808
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:23,640
Fair enough. Uh, Alan is back with us in studio.

2809
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:28,360
How are you doing? Good. So what would be your pick for game of the year? Well,

2810
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:32,240
I almost had to recuse myself from this entire segment because I went through

2811
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:36,480
the Wikipedia list of all the games that came out in 20. It came out in 2012.

2812
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:38,880
I've played three of them all year.

2813
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:42,820
So doesn't mean that Mass Effect was the only thing I played,

2814
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:47,360
but all the games that I put hours on this year were from last year, 2010, 2009.

2815
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:51,720
So I had three things to choose from. Black Mesa source.

2816
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:56,400
It's my best because it came out finally after eight years.

2817
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:57,880
So it proved all the haters wrong.

2818
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:03,560
Half Life got some love and it's just a huge testament of what a fan communities

2819
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:07,520
are capable of. It was flawlessly professionally done.

2820
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:11,600
And when I say the mod community, I mean Skyrim, uh,

2821
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:14,320
any community that has, uh,

2822
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:18,000
or any game that has a community that people that will put out content like

2823
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:22,080
this. Black Mesa is one of the pinnacle achievements of everything.

2824
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:26,080
Minecraft, any game with a big enough fandom that lets you add stuff to it.

2825
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:28,400
So, um, yeah, it plays awesome. Um,

2826
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:32,920
Half Life hasn't had a game come out for it since oh,

2827
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:37,920
seven with Half Life two episode two more time has passed between Half Life

2828
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:42,280
two and now than the original Half Life one got at SQL Half Life two. So yeah,

2829
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:45,240
it's my favorite franchise and they got some love. So that's my pick.

2830
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:49,680
Good answer. That's um, not what I was expecting you to pick,

2831
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,800
but now that you kind of said it, I'm like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

2832
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:52,840
There's a lot of sense.

2833
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:55,640
Three games to pick from and I had to do,

2834
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:57,520
I have to do the worst of 2012 from that too.

2835
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:00,840
All right, we can, we'll, we'll manage somehow. We'll manage. All right. Uh,

2836
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:03,240
remember there's no right or wrong answer. All right. Um,

2837
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:07,160
you've watched me play a ton of games and surely you can form an opinion out of

2838
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:08,000
that.

2839
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:10,200
Eh, it doesn't count if I don't play it.

2840
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:15,560
Use your own criteria. The rest of the internet does. All right. Uh, Loki,

2841
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:18,720
what is your top game of 2012?

2842
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:23,000
Uh, cause also I didn't play that many games. Um,

2843
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:28,640
during 2012 that came out in 2012, you know, it was like a handful of games.

2844
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:33,160
I'd have to say probably Borderlands two and then just because it's, you know,

2845
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:37,360
it's everything you liked from Borderlands one plus better writing, more guns.

2846
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:41,200
And it's just, it's fun. It's like everything you loved before,

2847
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:46,000
amped up to 11. It's, it's great. It was a great game. Great, you know,

2848
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:49,680
shooting lots of, I love the writing in it. It's, I don't know,

2849
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:52,720
I'm really enjoying him and enjoying the fact that I'm going back and playing it

2850
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:56,520
some more because I kind of stopped playing it for a while. One, you know,

2851
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:58,280
I got busy with Minecraft and everything.

2852
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:04,160
Um, that leaves me, huh? Um,

2853
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:07,280
I didn't really want to be predictable this year. Um,

2854
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:12,320
but I reserved the right to change this because I still have a one or two games

2855
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:13,680
I need to finish playing.

2856
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:16,200
So I reserved the right to come back on a future episode and say,

2857
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,200
I changed my mind,

2858
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:20,480
but I think it's going to take a lot to sway me from choosing mass effect three

2859
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:21,360
as my game of the year.

2860
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:25,640
And a lot of that has to do with the fact that I got into the series this year.

2861
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:28,760
So I kind of feel like I explored the whole trilogy this year.

2862
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:32,760
So admittedly a little bit of that spilling over into mass effect three. Um,

2863
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:35,600
but it's not really just what Jamie mentioned because what's funny about what

2864
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:40,160
she's talking about is that's not what interests me at all in the game. Uh,

2865
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:42,880
and I think that's a testament to the game itself.

2866
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:47,080
I think the staying power of mass effect three is the multiplayer.

2867
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:50,720
And I'm going to admit when I first reviewed the game here on OLR, I said,

2868
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:53,600
I won't give it my game of the year because some of the things in multiplayer

2869
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:55,000
tick me off. However,

2870
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:59,080
I think they've come a long way in correcting some of that,

2871
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:03,640
meaning that they have supported the multiplayer very well

2872
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:08,400
since the day it came out and with many free maps and free

2873
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:10,600
expansions and so forth, uh,

2874
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:14,640
the expansions to the multiplayer have done a phenomenal job at keeping it

2875
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:15,480
interesting.

2876
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:19,920
And it's one of the few online communities where I actually really enjoy playing

2877
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:24,320
the game online. It's an Xbox experience I've really enjoyed. Uh,

2878
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:27,840
and you know, uh, had some great time playing with friends, the game as well.

2879
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,240
There really isn't a game I've had a better value on this year with the

2880
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:33,640
exception of maybe World of Warcraft,

2881
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:37,840
Mr. Pandaria for the record. I really like multiplayer as well. And you know,

2882
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:41,120
I thought I would hate it and I ended up really liking it.

2883
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:46,200
I also like finding regular maps in the game that are actually the multiplayer

2884
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:50,520
maps later on. So all that ending bullshit aside, it's,

2885
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:55,480
it's not enough to really tarnish what I still feel was an amazing video game.

2886
02:24:55,720 --> 02:25:00,280
However, uh, there was a lot of great shit this year and you know,

2887
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:02,040
journey really,

2888
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:05,160
I was really almost wanting to name that just so that we could all have a

2889
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:08,120
different one. But then I go back and I go, but I,

2890
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:11,520
all the time I spent on Mass Effect three, I can't, I can't. Walking Dead,

2891
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:15,120
however, I might take the crown.

2892
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:16,680
If anything's going to snatch the crown,

2893
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:19,400
wait till I finish Walking Dead episode five. Cause that might snatch it.

2894
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:24,080
So we'll see. Cause you know, when, when the writing is good,

2895
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:25,080
it's like really, really good.

2896
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:28,320
And like Walking Dead has a lot of what I love about Mass Effect just in a

2897
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,840
totally different type of universe.

2898
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,840
But the whole like decision making that kind of comes back later on, it's just,

2899
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:37,680
yeah, there's a lot of that there too. So I reserve the right to change my answer.

2900
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:41,640
It's just the internet. It's not that serious.

2901
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:45,240
Speaking of not that serious, let's go to the flip side.

2902
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:49,200
What was your most disappointing game of 2012?

2903
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,920
Maybe you could say the worst game, but I would say more like,

2904
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:56,360
what was just such a huge disappointment that you're just really sad.

2905
02:25:56,360 --> 02:26:00,080
What was your most disappointing game of 2012? Um,

2906
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:02,360
I guess we'll go in the same order. So Dark Soccer, I'll start with you again.

2907
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:05,640
Um, Street Fighter X Tekken. Ooh.

2908
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:08,280
It was piss in a bucket.

2909
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:14,120
What about it? Just was it, it didn't play well, the whole Mega Man thing.

2910
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:18,120
It just felt like a giant insult to the people who were fans of the series.

2911
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:20,800
I can't help but think of the DLC being on disc.

2912
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:21,960
That's what I'm always going to think of.

2913
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:27,240
It's just a combination of a less than stellar

2914
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:30,680
game combined with really poor business decision.

2915
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:35,400
My, the fiscally responsible part of my brain just goes, no, can't do it.

2916
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:39,960
And keep in mind, I didn't buy it. I borrowed it and I gave it back.

2917
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:45,600
So it was pretty bad. Uh, who went next? I think Flaco.

2918
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:49,280
What would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012? Well,

2919
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:52,120
I didn't play it, so I guess that's why you can say it's not the worst game.

2920
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:55,880
But I was very disappointed that I heard so many bad things about the Silent

2921
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:59,920
Hill HD remake. That was pretty bad. Yeah. See,

2922
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:03,720
I've never heard anything good about it. And it's just,

2923
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:06,600
I was very disappointed cause I was very, I was very much looking forward to it.

2924
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:09,240
I was going to buy it right away. But you know,

2925
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:11,760
I guess luckily target didn't have it when it came out.

2926
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:13,960
And then I heard more and more about it and I was like, you know what,

2927
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,480
I'm not going to buy it. It sounds like it's a waste of money.

2928
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:20,840
There's also that crap with them not doing the upgrade. The, yeah,

2929
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:24,800
for the, that was for two right in the two and three collection. They didn't,

2930
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:27,160
yeah, they didn't upgrade the graphics like we have,

2931
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:30,680
or they didn't do the fog or something and wires are going off into the distance

2932
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:34,280
and you can tell them having done a patch for other versions,

2933
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:37,800
but not the Xbox one I think. Oh, I don't know about that. I just know,

2934
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:38,640
see that's this thing.

2935
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:43,080
There's so many bad so much bad news about that game and so many bugs and to

2936
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:47,080
release a game with that many bugs, it's just like, it's just too much.

2937
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:51,160
They needed their best tester back. That's the problem.

2938
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:54,080
You laughed and everything went to hell. How did this get through?

2939
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:57,720
I just feel like this guy back, I almost wonder if they took the viewpoint of,

2940
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,800
you know, we already tested this game. It's fine.

2941
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:03,720
We're just going to up residence to get out. It was a total disaster.

2942
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:08,200
It sounded like, I don't know anybody who bought it and liked it. Um,

2943
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,040
who'd be next? Oh, Alan. Alan's next. Alan,

2944
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:13,000
what would you say was your most disappointing game of 2012?

2945
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:18,160
Mass Effect Infiltrator for iOS and Android.

2946
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:19,880
Yeah, that was kind of.

2947
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:25,120
Cause I got my first smartphone ever finally in September and then I figured

2948
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:26,160
out that the data pad,

2949
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:30,240
which is like the sort of your characters in your party email you and it's

2950
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:33,200
really neat. You can, um, you know, update your galactic readiness,

2951
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:35,640
which is a mechanic and Mass Effect three through this app.

2952
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:36,880
It's not available for the Android.

2953
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:42,200
So only iPhone users get to do the little cute email character mini game.

2954
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:47,440
So I was like, all right, I'll get the other Mass Effect, um, mobile game.

2955
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:51,680
Infiltrator and you play a Cerberus dude and there's also ways that it ties into

2956
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:55,560
the, your three main campaign. It's awful.

2957
02:28:55,960 --> 02:29:00,960
It's an amazing testament to how good graphics can be on smartphones nowadays,

2958
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:06,200
but you play with your thumbs and it's really awful and it's not fun at all.

2959
02:29:07,480 --> 02:29:10,560
And it was like eight bucks that I wish I had back because I could buy lunch

2960
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:11,400
with that.

2961
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:15,840
It's not that good on iOS either.

2962
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:20,760
Was it really eight bucks on, on sale for eight bucks?

2963
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:24,600
I want to say it was 12 originally and I've heard it's no better on the iPad.

2964
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:26,480
And I think, didn't you want to install it off your iPad?

2965
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:30,720
Yeah, I did. It takes up a gig and it was just a wasted gig. No tan,

2966
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:33,240
no tactile control or tangible controls makes it a bitch.

2967
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:37,200
What's the IK though? I don't know. Cause I don't have one.

2968
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:40,440
I thought that it worked with the IK, but I could be right. It might,

2969
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:43,880
I don't know. Yeah, but that's all. Um,

2970
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:46,840
I'm trying to remember what the other game was that came out this year that I

2971
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:51,080
played Mass Effect Mass Effect three. Yeah. All right. Fair enough.

2972
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:53,360
Uh, Loki, then I guess we go to you.

2973
02:29:53,360 --> 02:29:56,080
What was your most disappointing game that came out this year?

2974
02:29:56,200 --> 02:30:01,040
Lollipop chainsaw. Oh, it was terrible. Uh huh. It just,

2975
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:05,720
it wasn't a fun game to play and it wasn't,

2976
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:08,200
I mean it's just kind of like, Oh, it's Suda 51.

2977
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:10,920
It's going to be so really crazy and edgy and stuff.

2978
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:14,120
And they tried that with Shadows of the Damned and it was just not very good game.

2979
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:18,360
Really? I liked Shadows of the Damned. Eh, it was all right,

2980
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:21,320
but I liked what I saw of it. It's just, it wasn't,

2981
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:25,560
it wasn't to the level of what I wanted. So I don't know.

2982
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:30,320
Uh, I'll drop a whopper on this segment.

2983
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:33,240
I'm going to say the most disappointing game of the year was Diablo three.

2984
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:35,640
You know what? Yeah.

2985
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:39,920
And I don't really know how to put it into words.

2986
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:43,800
It's not that I necessarily like hate, I mean, here's the thing. It's,

2987
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:48,080
this is very much not Diablo three was not the worst game of the year.

2988
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:50,280
I would say the worst game of the year would be something like,

2989
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:52,120
I was going to say Sonic four episode one,

2990
02:30:52,120 --> 02:30:54,360
but it only came out on the windows platform this year.

2991
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:56,800
But that would still probably be the worst game of the year.

2992
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:59,920
I would probably go with HD collection just based on what I've seen and so

2993
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:01,600
forth. But I would say honestly,

2994
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:04,160
Diablo three was the most disappointing game of the year.

2995
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:08,360
Just some of the craptacular decisions Blizzard made towards with the whole

2996
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:10,280
real money auction house was,

2997
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:15,280
was just such a bad grab and the PVP getting removed out of it at the end.

2998
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:17,600
It just, it just wasn't a lot of fun to play.

2999
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:22,400
Like somehow the fun got sucked out over the 10 years between Diablo two and

3000
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:23,080
Diablo three.

3001
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:26,320
And I think a lot of that was Blizzard really not listening to their fan

3002
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:26,800
community.

3003
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:29,600
So I think they're really going to have to go back and answer to that a bit.

3004
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:32,680
So when you got torchlight two,

3005
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:35,880
didn't you think that the pickup and go within the first 20 minutes of torchlight

3006
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:37,480
two was way more fun than Diablo three,

3007
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:39,240
but Diablo three was how many years in the making?

3008
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:44,520
I enjoyed torchlight two in the one hour I played it more than I did Diablo

3009
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:48,160
three. And that says enough right there. I think you're absolutely right.

3010
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:51,360
Torchlight two is a better game than Diablo three in my opinion.

3011
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:55,400
So that's that. Uh,

3012
02:31:55,480 --> 02:32:00,200
looking at some of the comments in chat room at, uh, live.vognetwork.com.

3013
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:03,760
Fantas says, no way. Diablo three should win game of the year. Sorry.

3014
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:04,920
That's my personal answer.

3015
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:08,360
I think it went poop of the year act. Acidic vampire says,

3016
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:12,280
disappointing doesn't mean bad. I think that's a very important point. And yes,

3017
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:14,960
I agree with you on that. Uh, tiger class says, Oh yeah,

3018
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:19,400
Blizzard canceled the Diablo three PVP mode. Um, they, they didn't cancel.

3019
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:21,640
Well, fifth dream fills it in there. They didn't cancel it.

3020
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:23,560
They just postponed it there. They basically,

3021
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:26,240
they realized it was, I mean,

3022
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:30,480
that said to me that they weren't as far along with it as they let on.

3023
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:32,960
And that now that they're actually building it, they're like, shit,

3024
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,360
this doesn't really work out very well.

3025
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:37,560
Or it's like it's throwing everything off balance. Like I, I,

3026
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:40,120
I think they're pulling it out of their ass as they go.

3027
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:43,280
And for a game that was 10 years in development, that's very alarming.

3028
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:45,960
And at this point, is it going to come in an expansion? Probably.

3029
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:49,800
That sounds ridiculous. I mean, they, they can't do that though.

3030
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:51,520
They have to kind of patch it in because at this point,

3031
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:53,320
wasn't that promised when they sold the game?

3032
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:55,800
I didn't pay for it.

3033
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:01,640
I never got my, I never got my dance studio, but I think there's a big,

3034
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:06,360
there's a big difference between a Warcraft dance studio and PVP,

3035
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:10,440
which has its very passionate fans, you know, even in, wow,

3036
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:13,280
we don't talk a lot about PVP on a courthouse cause not a lot of it play it,

3037
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:16,280
but there is definitely like, like one thing I learned this,

3038
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:18,000
what we haven't talked about a lot about it during the show,

3039
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,560
but we have been depth.

3040
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:23,280
We've been dipping our big toe in the water when it comes to game streaming,

3041
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,200
we're finally getting up with the current times.

3042
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:28,680
We've kind of relaunched our Twitch TV channel and we did a couple of games

3043
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:33,000
streams this week. We had mass effect three last week when there was no show. Uh,

3044
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,040
we did some multiplayer to show that off and Shane and I were doing some

3045
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:39,240
Warcraft this week while I was looking at some of the other Twitch channels and

3046
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:41,520
kind of what people are streaming on their world of Warcraft.

3047
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:46,520
Lots of PVPers lots of that is arena rated battlegrounds.

3048
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:49,000
I mean, if you're wondering like who's doing rated battlegrounds,

3049
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,200
just load up Twitch.

3050
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:53,000
And I imagine any of the competing websites like you stream and so forth,

3051
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:55,480
same story. There's a lot of that scene going on there.

3052
02:33:55,480 --> 02:34:00,080
So it definitely has their passionate fans. So, all right.

3053
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:04,160
Uh, there we go. So let's get to the frugal question of the week.

3054
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:06,360
Cause that was everybody, right? I didn't miss anybody. Just making sure.

3055
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:12,000
We asked a very similar question in our frugal question of the week. Uh,

3056
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:15,720
every week we ask our Facebook and our Google plus communities smash it

3057
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:20,120
together. You get frugal a question and we asked them one of the same questions.

3058
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:24,000
We just asked you guys. Holy fucking shit.

3059
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,600
We got 25 responses on Facebook. Yep. I can't read all of these.

3060
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:31,000
There were about eight after the first minute you posted it.

3061
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:34,960
Yeah, I know. And I looked before the show, there was eight and I'm like, okay,

3062
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:38,160
eight. I can manage that. Now there are 25. I,

3063
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:42,000
I am overwhelmed by you guys being so awesome and replying,

3064
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,200
but there's no way I can read all those answers. Oh my God.

3065
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:48,280
There's five on Google plus two. There's five people on Google plus Rob.

3066
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:51,880
If I have to read 10 emails, you have to read 48 little short responses.

3067
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:56,120
All right. There's five Google employees that listen to the show. All right.

3068
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:59,560
I'm going to, I'm going to really run through these. I apologize in advance.

3069
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:02,840
I'm going to really trim your answers to get everybody's answers out there. Okay.

3070
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,360
Um,

3071
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,960
act depth says dust and Alicia and tail is the game of the year.

3072
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:10,680
Dust combines RPG,

3073
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:14,960
Metroidvania and beat them up style game play to make a real fun game to play.

3074
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:18,680
And can you imagine this game was made by only one person?

3075
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:22,640
That's quite the feat. I didn't know. I was not as huge into,

3076
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:25,920
into dust and Alicia. No, nevermind.

3077
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:30,600
I'm getting that game confused with from dust. Very different. Sorry. Sorry.

3078
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:35,240
Yes. That is an awesome game that it was supposed to be an X-Box live indie.

3079
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:36,480
I have not played that yet.

3080
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:39,840
And it actually was so good that it became an X-Box live arcade game.

3081
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,040
Okay. All right. So I will, I will make it a point to check that out later.

3082
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:45,760
I thought when I first read it, I was like, Oh,

3083
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:48,360
he's talking about that from dust game that I played once. And I was like, nah,

3084
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:50,080
I'm not, I'm not into this. You know,

3085
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,840
it's kind of trying to be populous or whatever.

3086
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:59,720
Uh, Rob says my 2012 pick is the iPad version of pinball arcade.

3087
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:02,480
It has the most tables and they're all from actual tables.

3088
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:06,400
The iPad is the right size for the portrait orientation. Good, good,

3089
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:11,320
very good pick. Uh, Nick M replied. He gave two answers,

3090
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:12,160
big budget,

3091
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:17,000
halo four citing three 43 is ability to pick up the franchise from bungee and

3092
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,440
made the most polished halo today.

3093
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:22,760
I got to say halo four was pretty rock fucking solid compared to some of the

3094
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:26,600
previous halo efforts. I really agree with what Nick's saying there. Uh,

3095
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:30,920
smaller studio walking dead, citing the emotional connection, uh,

3096
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:34,200
red entertainment says three very good games. I've played this year,

3097
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:37,400
mass effect three dragon age origins, assassin's creed three.

3098
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:40,600
Remember it's this year. What, what you you've played. Uh,

3099
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:42,680
when I think of a game that I've played throughout the year,

3100
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:46,360
got a lot of enjoyment out of and shared with multiple people ticket to ride on

3101
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:50,320
the iPad. You know the old, the board game, the trains. All right.

3102
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:55,440
Uh, Justin M replied and said, dope upon kingdom for the wheat.

3103
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:56,760
It was released a while ago,

3104
02:36:56,760 --> 02:37:00,640
but me and my partner started playing it obsessively this year. Uh, good,

3105
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:03,880
not so clean because we make it dirty. Monopoly esque fun.

3106
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:08,360
Now I'm kind of curious. What's a good, not so clean. Cause we make it dirty.

3107
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:12,600
What's a like insensitive jokes or what's that all about there? All right.

3108
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:18,200
Uh, let's see, let's get to some of the answers from Facebook. You ready?

3109
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:21,440
Here we go. Degenerate Johnny. I'm positive.

3110
02:37:21,440 --> 02:37:25,200
I'm not alone when I say mass effect three. Why Garris?

3111
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:28,680
Just that big curiosity. Are you degenerate Johnny? Like,

3112
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:34,920
all right. Uh, DJ Rama S said, final fantasy theater rhythm.

3113
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:36,720
It was a unique music rhythm game.

3114
02:37:37,720 --> 02:37:40,560
Rob himself said assassin's creed three.

3115
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:43,760
They did a good job in reinventing a system that's not broken,

3116
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,680
but feels fresh and new with the reasons you liked past games.

3117
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:49,480
That's very interesting because a lot of people are giving assassin's creed

3118
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:53,440
three shit. Um, I haven't played enough of it to say, see, see it either way.

3119
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:57,120
But then again, Rob, here I am saying mass effect.

3120
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:00,040
Three's my game of the year and there's a lot of people to give that series some

3121
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:04,200
shit. So you know what? I am, I am sympathizing with you.

3122
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:10,240
Uh, Eric S replied Tricoro. Do you guys even know what Tricoro is?

3123
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:14,560
I've heard of it. Nope. I've heard of it. Do you know what it is?

3124
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,960
No, it's 2DX BeatMania 2DX. I think number 20.

3125
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:23,320
I just, that's why I knew what it was. Cause I was like,

3126
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:24,680
it's one of the Bimani games.

3127
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:28,160
Eric S says Tricoro because it's beat mania. Uh,

3128
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:32,200
Cram said mass effect three. I think the flaws were exaggerated.

3129
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:34,720
By the way, mass effect podcast.

3130
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:38,920
Don't give me that look. We're working on it.

3131
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:45,360
Look forward to more exciting things in 2013 from OLR studios. All right. Uh,

3132
02:38:45,360 --> 02:38:48,120
Haseo Sumuragawa says Borderlands 2.

3133
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:51,120
Handsome Jack is the most lovable bad guy ever.

3134
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:54,640
Can't help to giggle when his echoes pop up. That or Arkham city.

3135
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:55,840
Cause Catwoman is a bad-ass.

3136
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:58,640
Actually in the border, even though I didn't play Borderlands 2,

3137
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:03,040
that would be Dan's game of the year to say, I have to say Mad Moxie's awesome.

3138
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:08,600
Uh, Name and Lights says on console, Forza Horizon on PC,

3139
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:10,760
Missipandaria. Uh,

3140
02:39:10,760 --> 02:39:15,720
Gamer Girl said a mud called Oasis taking it back to

3141
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:20,280
the muds. That's awesome. You know what a mud is? Flocka, you got to confuse me.

3142
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:22,920
It's you log into the terminal,

3143
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:25,440
like speaking of text adventures like Zork and all that shit.

3144
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:29,080
Imagine if you were playing a text adventure MMO.

3145
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:32,120
That's kind of what a mud is. You go into like a terminal.

3146
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:33,960
I don't think I've heard of that before. Yeah.

3147
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:36,880
It's like they used to be much bigger like 10 years ago, but there's still,

3148
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:39,600
there's still a scene for it. That's the ready player one.

3149
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:43,720
Oh, okay. All right. Uh,

3150
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:46,200
Gamer Girl says I love this game because my first time playing,

3151
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,600
been playing since it came online a few days ago. Love it.

3152
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:54,160
Dark Tetsuya says I'm going to change it up and say DDR2 for the Wii because of a

3153
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:58,800
great song list. Flaming Toilet. God,

3154
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:03,320
I love that username says Journey. Thanks to the communication limits,

3155
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:07,480
there's finally a multiplayer game that doesn't make me hate people. True story.

3156
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:09,600
I was talking to, um, if you listen to Horde House,

3157
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:11,840
you've probably heard of Sunshine. He does,

3158
02:40:12,120 --> 02:40:17,120
he does the podcast with Spike Game Boy and he was talking to me,

3159
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:18,680
he'll probably talk about this on his show.

3160
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:20,520
He was talking about his play through on Journey.

3161
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:23,600
He finally played it through the first time and he said he had a companion that

3162
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:26,000
he had through most of the game too. And at the very end,

3163
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:29,560
the companion drew a heart in the snow. Oh,

3164
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:33,880
Oh, and it's like if you have all the fields at that same moment as well,

3165
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:35,200
it's just like, I'm going to like,

3166
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:39,720
that's like Les Mis level crying right there at the end. All right. Yeah.

3167
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:43,480
I was always like really chatty in my thing. I would just be constantly like,

3168
02:40:43,640 --> 02:40:45,880
I would just be mashing and like, we got to go fast here.

3169
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:50,280
So I'm just going to be like, follow me. I know where to go.

3170
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:52,000
Watch out for the big stone dragon things.

3171
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:57,640
Uh, dark Tetsuya in chat says, wait, OLR studios.

3172
02:40:57,640 --> 02:40:59,800
I thought you guys were a vog now. No, we are vog.

3173
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:04,800
We're vog is the network that many of the OLR studios shows play on,

3174
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:06,920
such as orange, Andreo and Horde house.

3175
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:09,320
But if you look at the way movies are made,

3176
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:12,240
sometimes the movie maker is not the same as the distributor.

3177
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:15,480
Go research it on Wikipedia. All right. Meanwhile,

3178
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:20,400
Veronica S replies and says Pokemon white version two because it's addictive.

3179
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:23,160
Another Pokemon addict. That's all right though.

3180
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:26,760
I know a lot of lot of pokey addicts. Ronnie B replied and said,

3181
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:31,000
far cry three. It motivated me to enjoy gaming again.

3182
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:34,000
That's a pretty big endorsement there. The environment is alive.

3183
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:38,320
The AI acts responsibly, engaging and overall a great game.

3184
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:41,160
It's on Steam sale right now. Uh,

3185
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:45,200
Ferdinand F replied and said lone survivor. I haven't heard of that one,

3186
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:49,600
but he says it scratched the silent Hill itch. I didn't realize I still had.

3187
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:54,800
I will have to kind of earmark that we like survival horror. So, uh,

3188
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:58,120
Burr replied and said, going by the number of hours poured into it.

3189
02:41:58,120 --> 02:42:01,920
Borderlands two, same great gameplay refined into perfection.

3190
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:04,920
And some of the most memorable and funniest lines of the year, hands down,

3191
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:09,040
honorable mention to assassins, Craig, assassins, Craig, Creed, not Craig,

3192
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:11,800
assassins, Creed three, uh,

3193
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:15,480
taking one of my favorite periods in history and adding new gameplay elements to

3194
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:17,840
great effect. Osofer replied and said,

3195
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:21,640
mass effect three keeps coming back long after it's been released only to play

3196
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:25,840
through it again and explore new paths in the story or another ending to enjoy.

3197
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:30,920
Uh, multiplayer endorsing that as well. Uh, more answers.

3198
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:35,520
Raginator says Diablo two. I know it's a 12 year old title,

3199
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:36,880
but he just got it this year.

3200
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:41,680
Console wise is two way tie between magic 2013 and super stardust HD.

3201
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:43,400
Those are two games on PlayStation three.

3202
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:48,000
I love the most and put the most time into a acidic vampire said mass effect

3203
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:48,400
three,

3204
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:51,600
a fantastic finale to a trilogy with the best characters ever written for a

3205
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:54,360
video game series. It's a pretty big endorsement. Uh,

3206
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:58,360
Luliana says mass effect three. It's just that awesome.

3207
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:01,480
Even if I'd played more while our hours spent, uh,

3208
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:04,320
I really wish we got to do more with Rex, but still Emmy three,

3209
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:08,400
Dave Falcon said it's Duke Nukem forever. What,

3210
02:43:09,240 --> 02:43:10,760
what are no wrong answer.

3211
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:15,520
There's no wrong answer because I spent a good portion of 2012 playing it and

3212
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:20,480
deus X human revolution because my fiance got me hooked on it. Oh, okay.

3213
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:25,320
I see you played it cause the fiance, you had to for the fiance. That's all right.

3214
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:29,040
P S happy new year. My gaming friends. Well, happy new year to you as well.

3215
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:32,120
Gino L said the walking dead.

3216
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:36,280
It handled some pretty taboo concepts gracefully and changed the way I think

3217
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:40,040
about games. Change the way I think about games.

3218
02:43:40,040 --> 02:43:45,040
That's pretty heavy right there. That's now I'm like super interested.

3219
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:49,600
Uh, Shane, uh, from hoard house replied and said mass effect three.

3220
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:51,960
What a fucking shock. Hey,

3221
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:56,640
most personally impactful game series I've ever played runners up persona for

3222
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:00,760
golden and DJ max technica tune. Uh, SSJ 100. Matt said,

3223
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:04,600
I'm going to say NHL 13 while this is no surprise for me,

3224
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:08,720
given I buy NHL games every year without fail this year is special with the

3225
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:12,960
current labor dispute and the possibility of there not being any hockey this

3226
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:16,880
year. NHL hockey. I have to look elsewhere for my hockey fix. Well,

3227
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:19,920
I do play and pick up hockey games in real life and go to minor league and

3228
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:22,640
college hockey. NHL 13 is the only way,

3229
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:26,280
only way to pay and watch my favorite players and teams play.

3230
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:30,000
That's a depressing answer. It is sad that that's like the only way to get

3231
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,760
hockey if you're in the NHL. Like I totally get it.

3232
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:35,320
And like I think that's like an awesome answer in many ways,

3233
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:37,000
especially if you're a hockey fan, but it's just like,

3234
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:40,080
it really puts it into perspective. Like they, they,

3235
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:41,840
they need to fucking figure it out.

3236
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:45,160
We have gone over the fiscal cliff and hockey is what has happened here.

3237
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:47,920
And this just happened like six years ago. They canceled their season. Yeah.

3238
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:50,320
I think it was that long ago. Shame, shame baseball.

3239
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:53,760
Never recovered from that shit. Well, I know they have now they have now,

3240
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:56,960
but they took forever. But when the next bargaining agreement came by,

3241
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:00,280
they signed it and they got it done right away. They didn't drag this out.

3242
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:03,000
And the hockey is doing this now for the second time in less than 10 years.

3243
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:06,800
Wow. A code man replied and said the walking dead.

3244
02:45:07,080 --> 02:45:10,360
I've never felt so emotionally attached to a game in a long while.

3245
02:45:10,360 --> 02:45:14,840
And this one definitely hooks you last but not least. Alpha Kananagram,

3246
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:21,120
Hatsune Miku project diva F even though the scratch feature is meh.

3247
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,520
Good. No wrong answers. I know, but I'm as in, I'm not surprised. Oh, okay.

3248
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:30,280
Good music rhythm game with neat bonuses. There you go.

3249
02:45:30,320 --> 02:45:35,120
I liked the variety of answers there. That was great. Um, it wasn't all,

3250
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:37,920
I mean, of course there was some mass effects, walking dead journeys,

3251
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:39,280
the things you're going to expect to see.

3252
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:42,760
But I really liked hearing about some of those other ones too. Uh, really,

3253
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,520
really neat. So thank you guys for answering.

3254
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:47,360
And I went ahead and read just about every year,

3255
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:50,000
every answer that actually had a game in it. I read those answers.

3256
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:53,520
So there you go. Thank you, Facebook. Thank you, Google.

3257
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:55,720
Thank you to everybody who's participated. Uh,

3258
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:59,840
was that a new segment for this year or did we debut that last year this year?

3259
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:03,920
So thank you for, um, catching onto our new segment this year. We appreciate it.

3260
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:09,600
All right. Uh, that means it's time to go to the mail bag. Oh yes.

3261
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:13,120
Revenge will be mine. Here we go to the mail bag mail bag at orange

3262
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:18,480
lounge, radio.com. You guys sent a lot of fucking email this week.

3263
02:46:18,520 --> 02:46:20,480
Yeah, but some of them aren't very big. Okay.

3264
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:24,080
So dark soccer is going to read your emails. Uh, but if she skipped some,

3265
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:25,400
don't be hurt because seriously,

3266
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:27,880
there were like 10 emails in there where I look, don't be butthurt.

3267
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:31,320
All it does is make you stink. All right. Dark soccer. Read some emails.

3268
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:36,160
This comes from Grimsley because it's a person I haven't seen before.

3269
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:39,400
I'm reading it because I'm nice. Hey guys, love the show.

3270
02:46:39,400 --> 02:46:41,920
I was wondering what the name of the background song used in one of your

3271
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:45,520
segments. It starts out like Bela Lugosi's dead. If that helps.

3272
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,680
Hope to hear from you soon. Happy holidays. What do we have?

3273
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:51,160
That sounds like Bela Lugosi's dead.

3274
02:46:51,160 --> 02:46:56,000
Honestly, cause I could only think of the chorus of

3275
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:56,840
Bela Lugosi's dead.

3276
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:01,920
So I went and YouTubed it and the beginning sounds an awful lot like this.

3277
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:04,600
Oh yeah, that's true.

3278
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:10,240
It's the boogal song. La Bossa Nova de Fabienne from Beatmania.

3279
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:14,440
It was in the hip hop mix in the U S I think it's from, um,

3280
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:18,040
some of the Japanese mixes too. Anyway,

3281
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:21,760
what I did for this listener and for anybody who's asking questions like what

3282
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:23,920
song are you using on orange lounge radio?

3283
02:47:24,160 --> 02:47:28,080
I made a post in the vog network forums at vognetwork.com.

3284
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:32,040
Click on forums, click on orange lounge radio and there's a topic. Yeah. Well,

3285
02:47:32,080 --> 02:47:34,040
you know, we get more people over there. There's a topic.

3286
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:35,600
What music do you use on orange lounge radio?

3287
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:39,440
And I gave you all the songs and links to the YouTubes so you can, you know,

3288
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:40,000
do it.

3289
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,480
How about for our listeners who, uh,

3290
02:47:43,960 --> 02:47:48,280
aren't as in tune with the goth music scene, play a little Bela Lugosi's dead.

3291
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:51,400
I was just about to do that except you were like two steps ahead of me.

3292
02:47:51,440 --> 02:47:54,120
Was that the entire email? Yeah, pretty much.

3293
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:58,120
I wouldn't mind reading the rest of the emails to Bela Lugosi's dead. Hey,

3294
02:47:58,120 --> 02:48:03,240
and if anyone ever watched, um, you know, early two thousands SNL goth talk.

3295
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:10,240
Hi Asriel, the prince of dark and sorrow and he works with me at the sit up.

3296
02:48:12,480 --> 02:48:16,160
All right, here's, here's the nine minute mix of Bauhaus,

3297
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:20,840
Bela Lugosi's dead. See that.

3298
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,880
So I thought it has to be the fugal song.

3299
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:31,040
Uh, Bauhaus named after my favorite art school that got shut down by the Nazis

3300
02:48:32,040 --> 02:48:32,880
but reopened.

3301
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:35,640
But then like all the way towards the end of the song is when it gets into the

3302
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:36,480
more familiar part.

3303
02:48:39,280 --> 02:48:40,120
But honestly,

3304
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:43,480
we would not have certain styles of furniture today if not for the Bauhaus

3305
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:44,320
movement. Just saying,

3306
02:48:45,800 --> 02:48:50,560
don't ever ask an art student to go off on stuff like that. Anyway, um,

3307
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:53,960
this one comes from spazzinator. Hi gang.

3308
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:56,120
It's your raging neighborhood spazzinator.

3309
02:48:56,800 --> 02:49:00,400
The strange thing happened that interrupted my plans to get a cat this weekend

3310
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:02,040
and let's take a minute. Just sit right there.

3311
02:49:02,480 --> 02:49:06,560
I'll tell you how I became the catless raginator in Buffalo. Oh,

3312
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:09,040
he's doing it as a, as a

3313
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:13,680
fresh prince. Yeah, but I'm not going to wrap it.

3314
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:20,240
You're moving with your auntie and uncle Garris on the Normandy.

3315
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:24,760
It's a parody. I get it. Yeah. I'm not reading it. Sorry. Can I wrap it?

3316
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:25,880
I just closed it.

3317
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:32,360
All right. I rage nator, I will do your email justice.

3318
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:35,640
Give me a moment to set it up. Okay. I'm going to go ahead to the next one.

3319
02:49:35,960 --> 02:49:40,240
This is from nasty canasta and I'm sorry I don't speak any Spanish other than

3320
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:44,120
Fuego. Um, so I'm going to try to pronounce this right.

3321
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:46,800
Is Ola y buenos burritos.

3322
02:49:47,800 --> 02:49:49,920
Ola y buenos burritos.

3323
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:52,920
I would like to bring your attention to your attention.

3324
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:55,920
A game announcement that flew under the radar, the binding of Isaac remake.

3325
02:49:56,240 --> 02:50:01,040
Only touch on major points announced so far produced and developed by Nicholas

3326
02:50:01,400 --> 02:50:05,320
releasing at the end of 2013. Currently confirmed for PC, PS3 and Vita.

3327
02:50:05,320 --> 02:50:09,160
Nicholas is in talks with Nintendo and Microsoft have come and to have the game

3328
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:10,640
on Wii U, 3DS and 360.

3329
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:13,120
The remake will support a new pixelated look similar to that of the GBA.

3330
02:50:14,120 --> 02:50:17,800
All content will from the base Isaac game and the wrath of the lamb expansion

3331
02:50:17,800 --> 02:50:21,400
will be included plus another batch of new content about as big as wrath of the

3332
02:50:21,400 --> 02:50:25,760
lamb is in the remake. Local co-op confirmed no online co-op is that would

3333
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:26,760
extend development time.

3334
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:30,160
Danny Baranowski returns to compose new and remixed tracks, new player,

3335
02:50:30,760 --> 02:50:31,840
playable character, new ending,

3336
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:35,680
and new final level that seems likely to appear after the game's shale level.

3337
02:50:36,040 --> 02:50:39,280
Anyone interested in finding out more in depth remake details can go to Edward

3338
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:44,320
McMillan's Tumblr at EDMUNDM.com and the binding of Isaac's subreddit on Reddit.

3339
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:49,040
I have also attached a mock up screenshots made by Edmund himself.

3340
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:52,160
Happy burritos nasty canasta. And um, yeah,

3341
02:50:52,160 --> 02:50:55,080
I can't really link these to everybody, but thank you for the reminder though.

3342
02:50:55,080 --> 02:50:58,480
Because I remember reporting on this before cause we were kind of joking like

3343
02:50:58,480 --> 02:51:01,960
LOL remake of a game that's not that old, but uh, yeah, I was interested in it.

3344
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:05,200
So by the way, uh, Ragenator's email,

3345
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:07,120
the problem is at the end of it,

3346
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:09,680
he turns it into a Rick roll thing and uh,

3347
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:12,160
I'm still a little upset about the time he tried to Rick roll the show.

3348
02:51:12,160 --> 02:51:13,600
So we are sending rage.

3349
02:51:13,640 --> 02:51:16,880
I will not be doing that email justice and we will be sending that email to the

3350
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:19,600
round files. So here you go, Ragenator. Here goes your email.

3351
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:26,720
The vog network.com.

3352
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:31,040
Okay. This is from raw steel UT. Hey guys,

3353
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:34,040
now that we're all done with Christmas and getting our new year's resolutions

3354
02:51:34,040 --> 02:51:34,880
ready and shit,

3355
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:38,360
what are you guys looking forward to in the next year in gaming?

3356
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:42,200
Any cool games? Maybe some cool, but ultimately useless gimmick thoughts. Ahoy.

3357
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:44,200
Um, I'm playing more mass effect.

3358
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:48,840
Hold that thought because we have a list list coming up that is tackling this

3359
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:51,120
exact topic. You read our minds.

3360
02:51:53,080 --> 02:51:54,880
Holy shit. Off topic.

3361
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:57,480
One of my friends has a copy of the live action Rurouni Kenshin movie.

3362
02:51:57,880 --> 02:52:02,480
Gonna watch it. Okay. Next up. I told you I was reading them all.

3363
02:52:03,480 --> 02:52:05,640
Do your orange Jones radio. First off,

3364
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:09,800
I would like to apologize for any grammar mistakes I may make as I have been

3365
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:12,960
very tired. I love the whole covering my ass in the beginning thing.

3366
02:52:13,480 --> 02:52:16,200
If you cover your ass in the beginning, that's fine. All right.

3367
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:19,680
I wanted to send a personal thank you to all of you for helping me with an issue

3368
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:24,000
I've had problems with dealing with for a long time now. A while back I asked,

3369
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:27,160
what was the best way to come out to friends and family regarding sexual

3370
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:29,920
orientation? You all gave me great help with it.

3371
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:33,080
The one thing I learned from OLR is to be yourself. Tonight.

3372
02:52:33,080 --> 02:52:36,440
I finally told my youngest sister that I have been bisexual for a good while.

3373
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:37,240
Now, 10 years,

3374
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:41,040
she asked if I had a girlfriend and I said that I had,

3375
02:52:41,080 --> 02:52:43,280
but things didn't go well. She said, well, you know,

3376
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:47,280
you could have told me and I wouldn't have cared one way or another because

3377
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:48,800
you're my sister. I said, well,

3378
02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:52,760
I was afraid because of our beliefs about quote that sort of thing. She's,

3379
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:56,640
she said, are you crazy? You're my sister and I care about you and love you.

3380
02:52:56,920 --> 02:52:59,200
So I just wanted to let you guys know that thanks to you all,

3381
02:52:59,200 --> 02:53:02,720
I finally got the courage to come out because of you all just to tell my sister

3382
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:05,040
how I felt. Thanks again. Sincerely, gamer girl.

3383
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:11,920
I think in many ways like, and I think we get asked this question a lot,

3384
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:16,400
like you've been doing this show for how long you've been doing this show for 10

3385
02:53:16,400 --> 02:53:17,360
and a half years.

3386
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:21,640
What motivates you to spend every Sunday to give up your entire Sunday night and

3387
02:53:21,640 --> 02:53:24,680
you don't go out to the clubs anymore and you go stay inside and you do this

3388
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:27,280
internet radio show, like what do you get from that? Why do you do that?

3389
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:29,560
And like in many ways,

3390
02:53:29,560 --> 02:53:33,360
that email that she just read like just justifies everything. Yeah.

3391
02:53:33,880 --> 02:53:35,360
So thank you.

3392
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:40,960
Totally. And major congrats to you too.

3393
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:44,240
And absolutely. I'm making it about us,

3394
02:53:44,280 --> 02:53:48,400
but congratulations to you and I know that you and I have talked about other

3395
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:53,000
things too, so just keep your chin up. Not you and me, Rob,

3396
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,400
but me and her. I got it. Hey guys,

3397
02:53:55,440 --> 02:53:57,360
Sterling here. A couple of weeks ago,

3398
02:53:57,360 --> 02:54:01,480
you guys were talking about Konami's VRC6 sound chip for the Famicom,

3399
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,040
but did you know there was a step above that?

3400
02:54:04,040 --> 02:54:08,880
The VRC7 to the NES sound capability to a whole new level placing literally

3401
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:11,640
on par with the Genesis slash mega drive. However,

3402
02:54:11,640 --> 02:54:16,400
only one game uses amazing chip being the Japanese exclusive RPG, uh,

3403
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:20,440
LaGrange point. There's okay. He linked to YouTube on it for how it sounds.

3404
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:23,880
Rob, if you would actually pull that up for me, I would greatly appreciate it.

3405
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:26,200
I will. Sorry. I was yelling at Ramen check as Ramen said,

3406
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:28,840
who the fuck goes clubbing on Sunday nights? We used to go,

3407
02:54:28,840 --> 02:54:31,480
it's not around anymore, so we wouldn't, but the, the, the,

3408
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:35,400
and don't make fun of us, but we had the goth club, the rage, the,

3409
02:54:35,480 --> 02:54:38,760
it was the rage and they changed their name. What was it called? Asylum. No,

3410
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:42,320
remember we went to the rage for my bachelorette party. Yeah, I know.

3411
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:45,920
But that was like, and after all the vodka shots,

3412
02:54:46,040 --> 02:54:49,040
the jello shots and watching Barbarella. I've been asked,

3413
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,240
when was the last time you went to asylum? And I'm like, I don't know.

3414
02:54:51,240 --> 02:54:55,640
When did I start OLR? So anyway, I'm sorry.

3415
02:54:56,160 --> 02:55:00,000
Uh, which one am I pulling up? Oh, this one. Yeah. From, um, Sherlock. Okay.

3416
02:55:00,040 --> 02:55:04,040
Got it. Okay. Yes. I want to do a play this. Okay.

3417
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:06,520
So let's listen to a little bit of it. I'm going to fast forward a little bit

3418
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:11,520
here. That's a Nintendo game.

3419
02:55:12,360 --> 02:55:16,520
That sounds very unlike most Nintendo games you're used to hearing.

3420
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:19,920
I probably picked like a really boring part, but

3421
02:55:21,880 --> 02:55:23,760
it looks like fantasy star. Sounds pretty.

3422
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:33,160
I also wanted to tell you about a mainstream game I've been playing from a

3423
02:55:33,160 --> 02:55:36,320
series, which I never thought would be playable for blind people.

3424
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:38,240
That being resident evil six.

3425
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:41,120
This game is what I like to call accidentally accessible,

3426
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:44,760
meaning that some of its features tend to help blind people without meaning to

3427
02:55:44,960 --> 02:55:47,320
chief among these is the PDA system,

3428
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:48,840
which points you in the right direction.

3429
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:52,280
You need to go as long as you have the button for it held down while you walk.

3430
02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:57,200
I'm already most of the way through chapter two of Leon's campaign and I'm

3431
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:59,640
through the trickiest section as far as accessibility goes.

3432
02:55:59,880 --> 02:56:03,000
That being the bell puzzle. Anyway, enough of my rambling.

3433
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:06,560
I hope you guys are having an awesome holiday season and keep up the awesome

3434
02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:08,440
job as always. RIP Shermy,

3435
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:11,880
Sherlock, my baby.

3436
02:56:13,800 --> 02:56:16,080
Yes. That has been the sad part of my year.

3437
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:19,000
You guys have made the holidays even more awesome.

3438
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:26,640
Sorry. I was thinking about my kitty. Looking forward, not back.

3439
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:31,720
I know it's tough. Um, this comes from, um, Robert M.

3440
02:56:32,040 --> 02:56:37,040
First here's hoping, uh, is that a Chiron beta cheer on beta prime was on your

3441
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:39,880
holiday rotation. Secondly,

3442
02:56:39,880 --> 02:56:42,280
if any of you have any experience with doing this,

3443
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:46,600
does anyone there or in chat know how well an Xbox 360 controller works on Mac

3444
02:56:46,640 --> 02:56:50,720
OS still a leopard or later? Finally, does Minecraft support said controller?

3445
02:56:51,360 --> 02:56:53,480
I wouldn't know about the Mac side of it,

3446
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:57,320
but I can use the controller in Minecraft at all in Minecraft.

3447
02:56:57,360 --> 02:56:59,280
I use the controller all the time in Minecraft. Oh yeah.

3448
02:56:59,320 --> 02:57:03,680
I use keyboard when I play. Yeah, I believe that. I, in fact,

3449
02:57:03,680 --> 02:57:06,080
if you play on our server, uh,

3450
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:09,400
or you just have access to the VOG network forums, uh, for PC,

3451
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:13,560
at least I have an expatter profile that you can use for the Xbox 360 controller

3452
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:18,160
that works perfectly and it works almost almost identical as the 360 version,

3453
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:22,120
but not quite. I'm fairly certain there are drivers available for Mac OS.

3454
02:57:23,080 --> 02:57:25,920
And I know, uh, probably doesn't help this email or,

3455
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:29,400
but the PlayStation three controller actually works with Mac OS.

3456
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:33,560
Okay. And now I was told to stop reading this on the air immediately.

3457
02:57:33,560 --> 02:57:36,120
This part of the email, no, I'm not going to go any further. Um,

3458
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:38,440
it actually is for me and I'm forwarding it to my personal email.

3459
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:42,120
So you'll hear from me there. Sounds kinky.

3460
02:57:44,760 --> 02:57:48,160
Shut up, Rob. It was actually really nice. All right.

3461
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:52,440
I was just sort of trying. How does he know what you're wearing today? I'm just,

3462
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:53,480
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right.

3463
02:57:53,800 --> 02:57:55,800
When do I ever wear something that isn't black?

3464
02:57:57,560 --> 02:57:59,200
So you're saying they're black.

3465
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:02,040
Yes.

3466
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:06,080
Next email.

3467
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:13,120
I love tooling you guys. Seriously. All right. Two emails left.

3468
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:15,720
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

3469
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:19,480
Now that it's cold on the East coast, I need another form of exercise. Well,

3470
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:23,600
I, we can't help you with that. Um, so I set up TDR in my unheated workshop.

3471
02:58:24,040 --> 02:58:27,200
I was totally getting back into it and I noticed that my score sucked.

3472
02:58:27,960 --> 02:58:31,240
I've played a few times since then and the left arrow works about 25% of the

3473
02:58:31,240 --> 02:58:36,280
time. So Loki, do I buy, build or hang myself from frustration.

3474
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:40,760
I've researched a lot online and it's hard to find a good pad since they're not

3475
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:41,600
made anymore.

3476
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:46,280
Even the metal pads you can find on eBay and Amazon get so-so reviews and should

3477
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:50,120
I stockpile new pads since dance games are dead? What would you recommend?

3478
02:58:50,120 --> 02:58:52,160
Keep in mind that I'm budget conscious.

3479
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:55,320
Good day citizens from your loyal turtle in Philly. Serious turtle.

3480
02:58:55,720 --> 02:58:58,480
Well, depends on how much you're going to actually play. Cause um, you know,

3481
02:58:58,480 --> 02:59:03,440
I remember I've looked into great detail for as pads go,

3482
02:59:03,480 --> 02:59:05,400
but um, yeah, you're right. A lot of them,

3483
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:07,240
they're pretty terrible,

3484
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:10,880
but there are mods you can do on some of them to make them not so bad.

3485
02:59:10,880 --> 02:59:14,760
Like some of the, uh, I'm trying to think what, what pads there,

3486
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:19,560
but most of them even on the eBay and stuff are really overpriced for what they

3487
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:23,400
are. So, um, your best bet is just, uh,

3488
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:27,520
I mean you can make something. I've made a few different types of pads.

3489
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:28,680
The last one I did was the

3490
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:29,520
um,

3491
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:34,680
Riptide pad I think. And that one cost me,

3492
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:37,480
I think $300 for two.

3493
02:59:37,880 --> 02:59:42,840
So that's not too bad. And um, if you only need one, it's even cheaper.

3494
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:46,640
Um, and it wasn't too bad. It just, it didn't ground it right.

3495
02:59:46,660 --> 02:59:49,040
But now we're just going to remake the whole thing anyways. Cause I have,

3496
02:59:49,280 --> 02:59:53,080
you know, some sheet metal sitting in my garage will shed. Um,

3497
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:57,760
I don't know. I, I'd go with the home built pad if you, if you can do that.

3498
02:59:57,800 --> 03:00:01,080
Otherwise, um, you know, the metal pads are all right,

3499
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:02,920
but just make sure if you do get one, make,

3500
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:08,040
it's like a really thick pad cause I bought some metal pads are about an inch

3501
03:00:08,720 --> 03:00:13,720
thick and they bent like it was really bad.

3502
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:17,440
So just read reviews and you know,

3503
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:20,040
ask on like some of the music game form,

3504
03:00:20,040 --> 03:00:24,560
especially people are using pads a lot. And I'd say as far as being, um, you know,

3505
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:29,280
music games aren't done. I mean, music console games are kind of dying,

3506
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:32,240
but if you want, you know, to do the PC, you know,

3507
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:34,520
simulator scene and that kind of stuff,

3508
03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:38,280
you're going to have a lot more options available to you and that's probably not

3509
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:40,680
going to go away anytime soon. So that'd be the way to go.

3510
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:43,640
Alrighty.

3511
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:48,560
All right. And the last email then if we're ready. Hey, OLR crew,

3512
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:53,200
AZHP here with an option or two on the news stories last week about online

3513
03:00:53,240 --> 03:00:56,280
services for games like Neverwinter Nights being shut down.

3514
03:00:56,280 --> 03:00:58,640
Whereas Star Wars Battlefront for PS2 is still running.

3515
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:02,560
My quote friend who worked at GameSpy told me that when developers stopped

3516
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:04,680
paying their fees for their services to stay up,

3517
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:09,200
GameSpy would just not shut them down. Um,

3518
03:01:09,240 --> 03:01:11,920
because getting a massive uprising of players getting butthurt that their

3519
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:15,080
online games were getting shut down was more trouble to deal with than just

3520
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:18,560
leaving the service up. My guess is that Gloo Mobile,

3521
03:01:18,600 --> 03:01:22,160
the company that bought GameSpy from IGN is realizing they've made a poor

3522
03:01:22,160 --> 03:01:23,240
investment on GameSpy.

3523
03:01:23,240 --> 03:01:27,560
They paid about 45 million in stock for GameSpy and the employees are jumping

3524
03:01:27,560 --> 03:01:29,920
ship because they don't like the new direction Gloo is taking them,

3525
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:33,980
found out about this practice and is trying to write some developers out for

3526
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:37,560
games they've stopped paying for. And those developers are, surprise,

3527
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:41,200
not willing to pay for 10 year old games and are just letting them get shut

3528
03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:45,240
down. Just my little insight into the world of video game business,

3529
03:01:45,280 --> 03:01:46,800
you're truly AZHP.

3530
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:49,160
I don't think it was that they were giving up on them.

3531
03:01:49,160 --> 03:01:52,400
It's just that they're raising the rates so much that it's just not cost,

3532
03:01:52,520 --> 03:01:53,880
you know, effective for them. I mean,

3533
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:56,560
I think that's really what it comes down to.

3534
03:01:56,920 --> 03:02:00,920
I found that part fascinating that they'd rather keep them running than have to

3535
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:04,400
deal with the internet rage. That says a lot right there.

3536
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:07,640
That was it.

3537
03:02:09,240 --> 03:02:10,080
I'm eating.

3538
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:14,760
No help. We have dead air.

3539
03:02:15,440 --> 03:02:16,160
Okay, Rob,

3540
03:02:16,160 --> 03:02:20,360
jeez, you have to shove your face with stuff and have me fill in the time.

3541
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:23,920
Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris, Garris.

3542
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:26,640
I will keep saying Garris until Rob finishes chewing.

3543
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:30,800
How about FUs? Okay.

3544
03:02:41,400 --> 03:02:42,960
My FU goes to AAA

3545
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:47,960
um, because of, um, claim issues from my car accident.

3546
03:02:48,480 --> 03:02:50,360
I may not be in a bad spot,

3547
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:54,160
but somebody else who was involved in the accident, um, was

3548
03:02:56,600 --> 03:03:00,400
for things that were proven on record to have been caused by the accident.

3549
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:03,920
So I'm going to take it up with them and they may be losing a customer.

3550
03:03:06,080 --> 03:03:06,920
Loki.

3551
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:08,000
Um,

3552
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:12,640
I guess FU to the fact that there's no one on Final Fantasy 11.

3553
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:14,160
It's kind of lonely. I mean,

3554
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:18,240
I like the fact that now I can actually camp the notorious monsters if I want to

3555
03:03:18,240 --> 03:03:20,280
and be able to attack them.

3556
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:21,760
Leaping Lizzie's all yours.

3557
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:24,160
No, seriously. Like I ran across them away.

3558
03:03:24,200 --> 03:03:27,320
Here's a notorious monster and we'll fight it. And I did and I killed it.

3559
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:30,600
And I didn't actually get the drop, but, um, I was like, yeah,

3560
03:03:30,600 --> 03:03:31,440
that's kind of cool.

3561
03:03:32,360 --> 03:03:36,480
Yeah, I noticed quite a few. Um, so it's neat. Um,

3562
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:38,800
and then of course, you know, uh, FU,

3563
03:03:38,800 --> 03:03:42,320
the fact that I've got some big projects I want to work on and

3564
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:47,200
I've been just like brain fried lately and I just haven't been able to

3565
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:50,040
concentrate on them. But some major stuff hopefully,

3566
03:03:50,560 --> 03:03:53,440
hopefully I'll actually work on this year. I really need to focus on it.

3567
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:56,440
All right.

3568
03:03:56,440 --> 03:03:56,680
Uh,

3569
03:03:56,680 --> 03:03:59,680
my FU of the week goes to my cohost for not knowing how to fill dead air when

3570
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:00,800
I'm eating. Uh,

3571
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:04,560
We didn't know you were getting food. Jeez, Rob. This is Rob.

3572
03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:11,680
And FU to Dark Sakura for furthering berating me during my FU segment.

3573
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:15,960
Uh, and just FU to the fact that vacation is blown by.

3574
03:04:15,960 --> 03:04:20,960
I have to go back to work on Wednesday. I know I have to go to work tomorrow.

3575
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:25,600
No, it sucks to be here. Why if I have a whole week off? Oh my gosh. But you know,

3576
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:29,720
no, in all seriousness, it's been a great mental break. So I'm like, I'm,

3577
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,280
I'm actually at this point where I'm like, I'm re I'm,

3578
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:35,640
I'm looking forward to going back to work and taking care of all these projects

3579
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:40,000
I've got going on. That'll change a day later. FU to myself for me. No,

3580
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,280
I do like my job though. I feel it's, you know,

3581
03:04:42,600 --> 03:04:44,720
who doesn't like a break from their day job though,

3582
03:04:44,720 --> 03:04:47,520
to go do whatever they want for a while. It's, it's a good mental rest,

3583
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:50,960
but I'm ready for 2013 to be a kick ass year.

3584
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:55,040
By the way, can I throw in a happy birthday to a celebrity? No. Yes.

3585
03:04:55,840 --> 03:05:00,600
Michelle Nichols turned 80 today. She is a flawless goddess. She, she is,

3586
03:05:00,680 --> 03:05:03,920
she is pretty damn flawless. I have to, she's one of,

3587
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:05,200
she's actually one of my,

3588
03:05:05,480 --> 03:05:09,040
I would say the only flaw I could think of possibly for her was that she

3589
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:11,840
participated in season two of euros, but otherwise,

3590
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:16,240
otherwise she did a fan dance at 50.

3591
03:05:17,400 --> 03:05:20,880
Yeah. All right. Uh, yeah.

3592
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:24,600
If you go vitamin water for making me pee like three times in two hours,

3593
03:05:24,600 --> 03:05:25,960
I'm not a pregnant woman. I swear

3594
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:33,120
you're just getting old like the rest of us. It's vitamin water's fault about me.

3595
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:36,640
Your half birthday just recently passed too. Cause mine day I'm like, Oh,

3596
03:05:36,680 --> 03:05:41,600
I'm almost 35. Yay. All right. Fun to be old. Yeah. All right.

3597
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:47,760
Let us get to one more segment before we get

3598
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:50,520
to the other classic game of the week.

3599
03:05:50,520 --> 03:05:52,880
I'll explain in a minute and our Twitter topics and so forth.

3600
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:56,480
It is a segment we like to call listless.

3601
03:05:56,480 --> 03:05:57,320
Okay.

3602
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:07,160
All right. The way listless works,

3603
03:06:07,160 --> 03:06:09,400
we are going to put together the ultimate list.

3604
03:06:09,400 --> 03:06:13,160
This is a very scientific process. Y'all the ultimate list.

3605
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:15,080
We're not going to have the theme music all night tonight.

3606
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:20,200
The ultimate list to discuss the top three of a topic and that topic tonight is

3607
03:06:21,880 --> 03:06:25,840
your 2013 predictions. Ooh. Okay.

3608
03:06:26,160 --> 03:06:28,040
So here's the way listless works.

3609
03:06:28,040 --> 03:06:30,640
We're going to go around the room and the folks participating tonight are myself,

3610
03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:34,560
Dark Sakura, Loki, Flacco, and Allen. We have a five man listless tonight.

3611
03:06:35,560 --> 03:06:38,400
You have a four man and one woman listless.

3612
03:06:38,400 --> 03:06:43,240
We have a five person. There's a woman man. So there you go.

3613
03:06:43,480 --> 03:06:47,760
You know what? My man, my boobs dominate. All right, fine, fine.

3614
03:06:49,640 --> 03:06:53,720
We have four men in a nag. Bitch, please. I will cut you.

3615
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:57,640
All right. Doing tonight's listless. Ah, you know, I love you. All right.

3616
03:06:57,640 --> 03:06:58,520
We're doing tonight's listless.

3617
03:06:58,520 --> 03:07:00,680
We're each going to go around and put three items on the list.

3618
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:02,440
Then we will go around and it's a really tough thing.

3619
03:07:02,440 --> 03:07:04,360
We're going to take one answer off the list,

3620
03:07:04,360 --> 03:07:08,040
but there's a twist in tonight's listless. This is,

3621
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:12,280
this is a listless twist for 2013. So.

3622
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:13,160
Twistless?

3623
03:07:13,160 --> 03:07:17,480
It's twistless. Here's the deal, because there's so many people tonight.

3624
03:07:18,360 --> 03:07:22,520
If somebody gets two of their answers taken from the list,

3625
03:07:22,600 --> 03:07:27,080
their third answer automatically becomes immune and cannot be taken from the

3626
03:07:27,080 --> 03:07:30,880
list. That's the twist. Immunity idol for an answer.

3627
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:33,000
So if you get two of your answers taken off the list,

3628
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:35,080
your other one cannot be eliminated.

3629
03:07:35,080 --> 03:07:40,040
May I suggest that we play the, uh, the whole tribunal song,

3630
03:07:40,040 --> 03:07:42,760
you know, while we're doing the eliminations,

3631
03:07:42,760 --> 03:07:44,480
that might be kind of funny there.

3632
03:07:46,360 --> 03:07:51,320
I'll see what we can do. All right. Um, so, uh, all right.

3633
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:56,080
So that's the twist this, this, uh, this year with listless 2.0. So anyway, uh,

3634
03:07:56,120 --> 03:07:58,600
in all seriousness, let's go around and start forming the list.

3635
03:07:58,600 --> 03:08:02,560
The chatters will then vote and they will get to put together the ultimate list

3636
03:08:02,560 --> 03:08:05,200
by the way, and I will throw this out there.

3637
03:08:05,440 --> 03:08:09,720
There actually is another upgrade coming to listless in 2013. Uh,

3638
03:08:09,740 --> 03:08:11,520
not just the upgrade I previously mentioned,

3639
03:08:11,520 --> 03:08:14,640
but we are going to have a way that podcast listeners can participate in this

3640
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:17,320
segment next year. So stay tuned.

3641
03:08:17,320 --> 03:08:20,920
We are going to do one segment where the podcasters get to participate as well.

3642
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:25,320
Uh, in 2013. So expect this segment to come back. All right. Anyhow,

3643
03:08:25,480 --> 03:08:28,800
it is your predictions in gaming for 2013.

3644
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:32,240
This can be as serious or as silly as you want. Chatters,

3645
03:08:32,360 --> 03:08:35,440
we may look to you for some answers as some good ones get duplicated.

3646
03:08:35,560 --> 03:08:39,680
So serious or silly as you want your 2013 predictions.

3647
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:42,040
We might,

3648
03:08:42,080 --> 03:08:45,200
I predict that I will get through a sentence without coughing or something.

3649
03:08:45,440 --> 03:08:48,040
All right, let's, uh, let's go around dark Sakura.

3650
03:08:48,200 --> 03:08:51,520
What is your number three answer for your 2013 prediction?

3651
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:55,440
Reggie Fils-Aime will actually reveal that he's Donkey Kong. Just shaved.

3652
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:04,520
And why do you believe this will happen?

3653
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:08,400
Look at the man's face. He's got gorilla face.

3654
03:09:09,520 --> 03:09:13,240
And like not Damon Auburn, Jamie Hewlett gorillas. I mean, he,

3655
03:09:13,400 --> 03:09:14,480
he looks like a monkey.

3656
03:09:14,800 --> 03:09:19,360
All right. Wow. I don't know. I don't know. That's, uh,

3657
03:09:19,880 --> 03:09:23,400
I don't know. I don't know. That one might get eliminated right off. We'll see.

3658
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:27,080
All right. Let's see though. Uh, moving around the list. Loki,

3659
03:09:27,080 --> 03:09:29,840
what is your number three answer for 2013 prediction?

3660
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:31,600
Final Fantasy 11 will go free to play.

3661
03:09:36,440 --> 03:09:39,120
And why do you feel that's destined to happen this year?

3662
03:09:39,160 --> 03:09:44,040
Because there's very few servers right now and they're

3663
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:47,240
hardly anyone on them. And honestly, if they went free to play,

3664
03:09:47,240 --> 03:09:48,760
I think they would get a lot more revenue.

3665
03:09:50,480 --> 03:09:52,480
All right. And I understand the, you know,

3666
03:09:52,480 --> 03:09:55,320
they have Final Fantasy 14 over there and they want kind of people to go to

3667
03:09:55,320 --> 03:09:58,560
that, but why wouldn't you want to keep your old service available? I guess it,

3668
03:09:58,560 --> 03:10:02,200
maybe, maybe not the cut into your new one. I don't know. As hard as that.

3669
03:10:03,560 --> 03:10:08,080
All right. Uh, Flaco Jones, what is your number three answer?

3670
03:10:08,560 --> 03:10:09,080
Uh,

3671
03:10:09,080 --> 03:10:12,360
PlayStation and Vita versions of first party Sony games are actually going to be

3672
03:10:12,360 --> 03:10:15,840
made by the same developers. Oh,

3673
03:10:15,840 --> 03:10:18,760
instead of like the whole like license thing, like, well,

3674
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:21,840
just like the whole, like, uh, uh, yeah, like uncharted,

3675
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:24,840
naughty dog doesn't do the Vita version or a little big planet.

3676
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:26,640
Meaty medical doesn't do the Vita version.

3677
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:29,880
Just stop pawning it off on one of your other developers.

3678
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:35,480
That makes a lot of sense. Actually. I am like totally okay with that. All right.

3679
03:10:36,480 --> 03:10:40,240
Um, moving on. Uh, let's go to Alan,

3680
03:10:40,240 --> 03:10:43,840
if we can with his number three answer. Where did he go? He's over there.

3681
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:45,640
Hello.

3682
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:51,680
The devil may cry reboot will flop and bury the franchise for good.

3683
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:55,680
The only good thing it will bring is really hot fan art of new Dante and Chris

3684
03:10:55,680 --> 03:11:00,560
Redfield. So there you go. The number three answer from Allen,

3685
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:05,040
devil may cry reboot flops and the only good thing it brings is a fanfic.

3686
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:09,640
All right. Uh, my number three answer, what did I do my list here? Oh,

3687
03:11:09,680 --> 03:11:14,560
my number three answer is that there will be a Vita price drop before the

3688
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:17,640
one year anniversary, which is in a couple of months. And I honestly,

3689
03:11:18,280 --> 03:11:20,120
I don't think they have any choice at this point.

3690
03:11:20,360 --> 03:11:24,640
And I would almost go so far as to say the three G one gets eliminated totally.

3691
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:26,720
Cause why? But, uh,

3692
03:11:27,080 --> 03:11:29,200
I'm just going to say a price drop for the Vita.

3693
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:32,600
And I don't think that's just wishful thinking because you're not getting a Vita

3694
03:11:32,600 --> 03:11:37,000
till the price drop. Right? I mean, I already missed the, the, the, the posts,

3695
03:11:37,080 --> 03:11:41,600
the black Friday deal, which is 180. So unless it's lower than 180, yeah,

3696
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:45,720
I'm not buying it. It won't just be the three DS that gets that.

3697
03:11:46,240 --> 03:11:50,280
All right, let's go to dark Sakura with her number two answer.

3698
03:11:50,600 --> 03:11:54,280
Mass effect fans will get all butthurt because, um,

3699
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:58,200
the rumor about the DLC, uh, proving indoctrination theory is true.

3700
03:12:01,240 --> 03:12:04,960
So, um, DLC indoctrination is true. Yeah.

3701
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:08,080
And of course, you know, all the fans will get butthurt.

3702
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:12,120
I'll probably be a bit butthurt for those that are not in tapped into the fandom

3703
03:12:12,120 --> 03:12:16,880
briefly described what the indoctrination theory is without spoiling the ending.

3704
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:20,400
Uh, not much basically. Okay.

3705
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:23,520
There's this thing where there's like a kind of mind control in the game for

3706
03:12:23,520 --> 03:12:25,240
people who've been around Reaper technology a lot.

3707
03:12:25,240 --> 03:12:27,640
And the Reapers are the big bad guys. And, um,

3708
03:12:27,640 --> 03:12:30,920
basically they can kind of make you do whatever they want you to and think

3709
03:12:30,920 --> 03:12:34,040
whatever they want you to think. So maybe the whole ending was hallucinated.

3710
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:39,760
Fair enough. All right. Uh,

3711
03:12:39,800 --> 03:12:42,600
let's move on to Loki. Your number two answer.

3712
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:48,120
Bandit two will flop and the only good thing you'll get from it is fanfic.

3713
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:53,240
Well, didn't I just hear that?

3714
03:12:57,200 --> 03:13:01,320
And because of the Wii U and you think you had trouble with niche games on the

3715
03:13:01,320 --> 03:13:04,600
Wii, you haven't seen anything yet. All right. So, uh,

3716
03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:07,920
Flaco Jones, what is your number two answer?

3717
03:13:08,280 --> 03:13:11,320
The next generation Xbox, the lube, uh,

3718
03:13:11,360 --> 03:13:15,320
will be a hundred dollars if you sign up for a two year cell phone style

3719
03:13:15,320 --> 03:13:19,720
commitment and pay a higher tier of Xbox lives, say like 15 bucks a month.

3720
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:22,480
That answer.

3721
03:13:22,560 --> 03:13:27,320
I hate that answer because it is so probably true. Like, Oh my God,

3722
03:13:27,320 --> 03:13:31,840
I, Oh, I hate you for saying that because like I could see that happening X.

3723
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:34,320
So you're basically saying Xbox lube goes the way the iPhone.

3724
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:39,040
It's just 99 99 with a two year commitment to Xbox live. Yeah.

3725
03:13:39,040 --> 03:13:43,480
But then even X, yeah, platinum. Exactly what I was thinking. Oh, you Dick.

3726
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:47,960
All right. Alan, your number two answer.

3727
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:53,680
Watchdogs and Bioshock infinite will destroy everyone else's asshole as far as

3728
03:13:53,680 --> 03:13:54,880
gaming the year lists.

3729
03:13:56,480 --> 03:13:58,920
The only beat the two games that everyone loses their mind over.

3730
03:14:00,480 --> 03:14:02,760
What about, what about bungees destiny?

3731
03:14:02,760 --> 03:14:04,080
That was the other one I was thinking of.

3732
03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:07,760
That's supposed to be a real like asshole blower. I guess if I'm used to use,

3733
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:11,280
that's not coming up this year. Salacious pop turn or 2013.

3734
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:13,960
You don't think so? No. All right. It's not even close.

3735
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:17,200
You think it's either pushing it back. They're pushing it back to the next,

3736
03:14:17,240 --> 03:14:22,120
next 2014. All right. Uh, going to who's left me.

3737
03:14:22,120 --> 03:14:26,680
My number two answer, my number two answer for 2013 prediction is, uh,

3738
03:14:26,720 --> 03:14:30,120
final fantasy 14 reborn. Not bad.

3739
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:37,680
You know what? That one's not fair. Why? I can't say why.

3740
03:14:38,520 --> 03:14:41,440
Well, it's a, it's a prediction. Final Fantasy 14 reborn.

3741
03:14:41,560 --> 03:14:44,880
Turns out to not be that bad. And it's the first time they've ever, uh,

3742
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:49,760
reversed course on an MMO and it works. We'll see. All right.

3743
03:14:50,200 --> 03:14:54,320
Uh, so, so far we have Reggie reveals he's actually donkey Kong.

3744
03:14:54,520 --> 03:14:58,840
Final fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita ports made by the same developers.

3745
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,080
Devil may cry. Reboot flops.

3746
03:15:01,240 --> 03:15:05,360
Vita price drop before the one year anniversary indoctrination DLC ending,

3747
03:15:05,360 --> 03:15:09,400
but hurts mass effect fans. Bayonetta two will flop, but yay fanfic.

3748
03:15:09,760 --> 03:15:12,480
The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with a commitment.

3749
03:15:12,800 --> 03:15:16,160
Watchdogs and bio shocks blows up game of the year lists and other things.

3750
03:15:16,360 --> 03:15:20,200
Final fantasy 14 reborn. Not bad gift. All right,

3751
03:15:20,220 --> 03:15:24,520
so now we get down to the number one answers.

3752
03:15:24,560 --> 03:15:28,200
Dark sahara compile will rise from the ashes,

3753
03:15:28,200 --> 03:15:32,320
not as compile heart and bring us a new guard at game.

3754
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:36,980
As in guard at guy den was the guardian legend.

3755
03:15:37,440 --> 03:15:41,520
One of these years, I'd like you to be right. All right. Uh, Loki,

3756
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:43,800
your number one answer that we is going to flop.

3757
03:15:45,280 --> 03:15:47,080
And the reason I say that is because they haven't,

3758
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:50,140
they're not going to have any good games coming out and I'm not talking about

3759
03:15:50,140 --> 03:15:53,720
Pikmin. Yeah. Some people like Pikmin, but Pikmin does not fucking sell systems.

3760
03:15:54,240 --> 03:15:58,520
Okay. I'm talking about like Mario, Zelda, not until fourth quarter,

3761
03:15:58,720 --> 03:16:03,320
2013 and so basically you're going to have a big nine month dead period,

3762
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:08,440
at least more than nine months where it's just going to dip down to nothing

3763
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:12,120
because it's not selling like hotcakes now they're on. I mean,

3764
03:16:12,840 --> 03:16:16,440
don't get me wrong. They've got lots of systems out there right now. Um,

3765
03:16:16,480 --> 03:16:19,400
or at least there's, you know, we don't know how many systems they have out there,

3766
03:16:19,400 --> 03:16:20,760
but they're not,

3767
03:16:21,400 --> 03:16:25,580
they're not selling out and that's not good to not be selling out right now.

3768
03:16:25,640 --> 03:16:27,760
And then granted, I know their supplies a little better,

3769
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:32,020
but it's not that much better. You just popped in my head. Hmm. Flippity,

3770
03:16:32,020 --> 03:16:36,600
floppy. We use on its way. Flocko Jones,

3771
03:16:36,620 --> 03:16:41,280
your number one prediction for 2013 a skyward sword will be ported to the Wii U

3772
03:16:41,280 --> 03:16:45,080
replacing the innovative motion control with innovative touch control.

3773
03:16:46,680 --> 03:16:48,240
When you're talking about motion control,

3774
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:50,880
they're just going to do motion control with the game pad.

3775
03:16:50,880 --> 03:16:53,720
It'll be the exact fucking thing again.

3776
03:16:54,400 --> 03:16:58,280
Skyward have to use the screen skyward sword to the Wii U with touch control.

3777
03:16:58,280 --> 03:17:02,680
It's new control skyward sword. Yes. All right. Fair enough. Alan,

3778
03:17:02,840 --> 03:17:04,760
your number one answer.

3779
03:17:05,520 --> 03:17:10,140
BioWare will continue to support mass effect free multiplayer with DLC and

3780
03:17:10,140 --> 03:17:13,680
weekend events through at least June.

3781
03:17:15,560 --> 03:17:16,720
I would like that to be true.

3782
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:20,640
All right. From a true fan boy,

3783
03:17:21,240 --> 03:17:24,320
I was still getting my regular updates through June. All right.

3784
03:17:25,680 --> 03:17:27,720
All right. And my number one answer,

3785
03:17:28,360 --> 03:17:31,760
the last one for the list before we do the elimination rounds,

3786
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:37,200
no PlayStation four this year.

3787
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:41,040
I think everybody's expecting it to happen. I don't think it will.

3788
03:17:41,240 --> 03:17:44,320
That's a very serious reply. I think the new X-Box will happen.

3789
03:17:44,360 --> 03:17:48,320
I don't think Sony Sony needs to recover on the Vita right now.

3790
03:17:48,400 --> 03:17:51,000
I don't think they're under any pressure to get the PlayStation four out.

3791
03:17:52,080 --> 03:17:54,640
Try to learn from the Wii U and the X-Box launches.

3792
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:58,480
I think it's the smart thing to wait if you're Sony, but we'll see.

3793
03:17:58,560 --> 03:18:02,160
I say no PlayStation four in 2013. All right.

3794
03:18:02,160 --> 03:18:06,040
So there it is 15 things on the damn list right now.

3795
03:18:06,400 --> 03:18:11,040
Reggie is donkey Kong. Final Fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita ports made by the

3796
03:18:11,080 --> 03:18:14,800
same developers as PS three devil may cry. Reboot flops.

3797
03:18:14,880 --> 03:18:18,800
Beat a price drop before the one year anniversary DLC indoctrination ending,

3798
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:22,360
but hurts mass effect fans Bayonetta two flops, but fanfic.

3799
03:18:22,600 --> 03:18:26,240
The X-Box lube is a hundred dollars with the commitment watchdogs and bio shot

3800
03:18:26,240 --> 03:18:29,460
game of the year list final fantasy reborn. Not bad.

3801
03:18:29,460 --> 03:18:33,120
JPG compile will rise from the ashes with a new guard at game.

3802
03:18:33,360 --> 03:18:38,280
Wii U will flop skyward sword goes to Wii U with touch control mass effect

3803
03:18:38,280 --> 03:18:42,240
multiplayer through June and no PlayStation four.

3804
03:18:42,440 --> 03:18:46,640
Now we get to the very tough part of the round.

3805
03:18:52,320 --> 03:18:55,960
All right. That's actually not the music I would have used.

3806
03:18:56,840 --> 03:18:59,440
Some of these YouTube's are labeled very strangely.

3807
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:03,760
Let's do this theme song here. Let's try this for the vote off.

3808
03:19:05,360 --> 03:19:06,200
Much better.

3809
03:19:08,960 --> 03:19:11,000
All right, so here we are at tribal council.

3810
03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:17,240
Will you tell me about how Russell wronged you and how you're going to vote his

3811
03:19:17,240 --> 03:19:20,160
ass out tonight? All right, for real. Here we go.

3812
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:23,160
Going around and eliminating items that are not worthy of the list.

3813
03:19:23,160 --> 03:19:26,320
Remember if two of a person's items get eliminated,

3814
03:19:26,320 --> 03:19:29,160
the third answer becomes immune. So dark soccer,

3815
03:19:29,160 --> 03:19:30,680
which of these is not worthy of the list?

3816
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:35,720
Um, sorry, Alan.

3817
03:19:35,720 --> 03:19:40,000
I'm going to take out the devil may cry reboot because there is such a huge fan

3818
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:42,640
base that it will make its money back just from fan base alone.

3819
03:19:43,400 --> 03:19:45,440
But the fanfic, dark soccer, the fanfic.

3820
03:19:45,480 --> 03:19:48,400
Yeah, the fanfic will happen regardless.

3821
03:19:49,160 --> 03:19:53,120
People will still buy the game. I bought orphan Rob.

3822
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:55,840
It doesn't take a miss Clio to predict. I bought orphan. All right.

3823
03:19:55,880 --> 03:19:59,360
Hey, you played a demo yet? Fair enough. Huh? Uh, I've seen it.

3824
03:19:59,360 --> 03:20:03,840
I haven't played it myself. Dante's pretty hot. Don't get me wrong. All right.

3825
03:20:03,920 --> 03:20:08,640
Uh, who is next? Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list? Um,

3826
03:20:08,760 --> 03:20:10,800
I'm going to have to say,

3827
03:20:13,960 --> 03:20:16,840
uh, compile it. It's just, it's not, it's not going to happen.

3828
03:20:16,840 --> 03:20:20,600
We've got to be real here. All right. Compile rising from the ashes.

3829
03:20:20,640 --> 03:20:23,960
It just ain't happening. It's a wonderful pipe dream, but it's just,

3830
03:20:23,960 --> 03:20:27,040
it's not going to happen. All right. Fair enough. Uh,

3831
03:20:27,080 --> 03:20:31,600
then we will go to a Flaco. Which of these is not worthy of the list?

3832
03:20:31,840 --> 03:20:34,680
I can't decide cause they're all going to happen. Um,

3833
03:20:35,400 --> 03:20:39,920
I guess I'll just have to give dark soccer immunity and say indoctrination.

3834
03:20:40,200 --> 03:20:41,920
You're going to take indoctrination off the list.

3835
03:20:42,200 --> 03:20:46,520
You're going to give Reggie is actually a shaved donkey Kong immunity because I'm

3836
03:20:46,520 --> 03:20:47,360
a little,

3837
03:20:47,480 --> 03:20:50,760
there's something about that answer that worries me a little bit.

3838
03:20:51,160 --> 03:20:54,520
I don't want to go there. Other people agree with me, but uh,

3839
03:20:55,680 --> 03:20:59,360
I think he looks like a gorilla. I know.

3840
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:02,240
I really want to just get that answer off the list.

3841
03:21:02,240 --> 03:21:05,680
I don't want to give an immunity. So Flaco, I'm going to really change my answer.

3842
03:21:05,680 --> 03:21:09,480
Thank you. So you're changing your answer. Reggie. All right. That's a good,

3843
03:21:10,600 --> 03:21:14,280
that's a good mass effect. All right. So that gets immunity.

3844
03:21:14,280 --> 03:21:17,680
So mass effect gets immunity. There we go. I should have added that, you know,

3845
03:21:17,680 --> 03:21:21,560
what was it? Um, who was it that they always have during those? Uh,

3846
03:21:22,520 --> 03:21:24,120
Oh, it's a water.

3847
03:21:24,200 --> 03:21:26,600
It was going to be holding like a human head the next, uh,

3848
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:29,240
Nintendo conference thing that they do because he's always holding,

3849
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:31,280
something weird, like a banana or some weird shit.

3850
03:21:33,960 --> 03:21:38,200
Universe of difference between a banana and a head, maybe a shrunken head. Yeah,

3851
03:21:38,200 --> 03:21:41,840
but it's weird though. He's just like putting it out into the crowd. Think of it.

3852
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:45,120
Think of it this way. Flaco, uh,

3853
03:21:45,160 --> 03:21:49,160
mass effect fans getting butt hurt by something. That's a given that will

3854
03:21:49,160 --> 03:21:52,360
happen. So, you know, I don't, I don't know if you should eliminate it. All right.

3855
03:21:52,800 --> 03:21:55,840
Anyhow, let's go. It has immunity. Yeah, it has immunity. All right. Uh,

3856
03:21:55,880 --> 03:21:58,400
let's go to Alan. Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

3857
03:22:00,240 --> 03:22:03,560
So generally whenever I eliminate something, the chat room hates me.

3858
03:22:03,560 --> 03:22:07,720
So I'm really going to try and keep the more controversial ones up and get rid of

3859
03:22:07,720 --> 03:22:08,800
the more normal ones.

3860
03:22:09,800 --> 03:22:14,800
I'm going to take off final fantasy 14 reborn isn't bad.

3861
03:22:17,160 --> 03:22:19,960
Maybe perhaps have some bias. I don't know.

3862
03:22:23,280 --> 03:22:26,360
You think it will be bad. All right. That's fair. That's fair. All right. Uh,

3863
03:22:26,400 --> 03:22:29,280
what? I was gonna say some bias of the person who said that statement.

3864
03:22:30,760 --> 03:22:33,160
All right. Uh, then that leaves me.

3865
03:22:33,160 --> 03:22:36,040
So which of Alan's answers should I get rid of? No. Uh, all right.

3866
03:22:36,040 --> 03:22:39,040
So my turn to figure out which of these is not worthy of list. Um,

3867
03:22:40,840 --> 03:22:45,320
um, oh, did you not get rid of them? I did. You did. Okay. Uh,

3868
03:22:45,320 --> 03:22:46,760
I'm going to get rid of, um,

3869
03:22:50,320 --> 03:22:54,840
I don't know. Uh, it's all going to happen. They're all going to happen.

3870
03:22:54,840 --> 03:22:56,960
They really are. Um, okay.

3871
03:22:56,960 --> 03:23:00,000
I'm going to get rid of Vita ports are made by the same developers.

3872
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:03,760
Cause that's not going to happen. That's never going to happen. That's true.

3873
03:23:04,120 --> 03:23:05,800
It would happen if they actually wanted to save the Vita.

3874
03:23:07,280 --> 03:23:10,120
Yeah. They really wanted to save the Vita maybe, but no,

3875
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:11,280
that's not what's going to happen. All right.

3876
03:23:11,440 --> 03:23:13,680
So here's the ones you can actually vote on.

3877
03:23:13,680 --> 03:23:18,680
We have final fantasy 11 goes free to play Vita price drop before the one year

3878
03:23:18,800 --> 03:23:23,320
anniversary DLC indoctrination ending, but hurts mass effect fans.

3879
03:23:23,360 --> 03:23:26,560
I kind of butchered the grammar there. Sorry. Bayonetta two will flop,

3880
03:23:26,600 --> 03:23:30,280
but fanfic. The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with commitment.

3881
03:23:30,480 --> 03:23:33,420
Watchdogs and bio shear trample game of the year list.

3882
03:23:33,560 --> 03:23:38,320
We you will flop skyward sword goes to Wii U with touch control mass effect

3883
03:23:38,320 --> 03:23:41,560
multiplayer through June, which I, that's the one I really should got rid of.

3884
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:45,520
Oh well. And uh, no PlayStation four. So there it is.

3885
03:23:45,680 --> 03:23:48,100
You guys can place your vote now.

3886
03:23:48,100 --> 03:23:52,340
Send you private message to Rob Roberts in the chat room with your number one

3887
03:23:52,340 --> 03:23:56,420
and your number two answers for which of those you think will be the case.

3888
03:23:56,740 --> 03:23:59,900
And we will tally up the results and get to that at the end of the show.

3889
03:24:01,100 --> 03:24:03,820
All right. Thanks for playing guys.

3890
03:24:07,220 --> 03:24:10,820
Here's your immunity idol for playing. All right. For life.

3891
03:24:10,860 --> 03:24:13,380
It's your immunity idol for life, for life.

3892
03:24:13,620 --> 03:24:16,300
She's the only one that got an immunity. Yeah.

3893
03:24:16,300 --> 03:24:19,940
She's the only one that got an immunity this time. I think,

3894
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:24,940
I think I should have a queen hat or chocolate.

3895
03:24:26,540 --> 03:24:29,100
Okay. Alan, sit on Jamie's head. All right.

3896
03:24:34,460 --> 03:24:37,700
All right. Uh, what does that leave for the segments here? Oh, we've got,

3897
03:24:37,700 --> 03:24:38,620
we got to do this.

3898
03:24:38,620 --> 03:24:43,620
We have to do a very anticipated moment here in 2012 because remember when the

3899
03:24:44,780 --> 03:24:48,660
power went out during the last show that Flaco Jones was on,

3900
03:24:48,980 --> 03:24:51,420
his segment got cut and he never got to do it.

3901
03:24:51,420 --> 03:24:53,940
And literally he was in the middle of segment talking about it like this.

3902
03:24:53,940 --> 03:24:59,780
And then he's like sad because the dark.

3903
03:25:00,020 --> 03:25:03,680
All right, so we are going to allow Flaco Jones tonight. Yes,

3904
03:25:03,680 --> 03:25:05,580
we're going to do two of these segments this week.

3905
03:25:05,740 --> 03:25:09,380
We're going to allow him to do his makeup classic game of the week tonight.

3906
03:25:09,380 --> 03:25:14,380
So making up for the show that was lost in May Flaco Jones,

3907
03:25:14,820 --> 03:25:17,100
what is your classic game of the week?

3908
03:25:17,100 --> 03:25:22,100
My classic game of last May is Chrono Cross.

3909
03:25:22,900 --> 03:25:26,660
Yay. Good pick. Really good opening theme.

3910
03:25:27,300 --> 03:25:31,060
Amazing. I have to find actually a Chrono Cross video.

3911
03:25:32,060 --> 03:25:35,620
One song in there that I really liked. The girls do something in the stars.

3912
03:25:37,340 --> 03:25:40,020
Yeah. Yeah. That's. And it was an S word. And I was like, stole? Yeah.

3913
03:25:40,500 --> 03:25:43,500
Is that the ending title theme? I don't remember.

3914
03:25:44,500 --> 03:25:47,260
I just know that it's a piece I really liked from that game.

3915
03:25:47,340 --> 03:25:49,540
My wife got me the soundtrack last Christmas.

3916
03:25:52,820 --> 03:25:55,980
Well, here you go. So you can all enjoy.

3917
03:25:57,820 --> 03:26:00,700
Yay. Which was the best part of the game. Oh, come on.

3918
03:26:01,900 --> 03:26:05,660
One of the best parts of the many best parts of the game. If that makes sense.

3919
03:26:05,980 --> 03:26:10,140
All right. May by square in 1999 for Japan, 2000 for North America.

3920
03:26:10,260 --> 03:26:12,700
It's technically the third game in the Chrono series,

3921
03:26:12,700 --> 03:26:17,100
followed by Chrono Trigger 95 and the Japanese only text based game,

3922
03:26:17,100 --> 03:26:19,580
Radical Dreamers 1996.

3923
03:26:19,580 --> 03:26:22,020
It's set 20 years after the events in Chrono Trigger.

3924
03:26:22,700 --> 03:26:26,580
The game focuses on Surge, this kid who stumbles into an alternate dimension

3925
03:26:26,580 --> 03:26:29,860
where he died 10 years earlier and created a schism in the timeline

3926
03:26:29,860 --> 03:26:32,580
that was saved by your party in Chrono Trigger.

3927
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:36,700
He teams up with a mysterious thief named Kid on a mission to stop

3928
03:26:36,740 --> 03:26:39,460
a demi human named Links who is trying to use

3929
03:26:39,700 --> 03:26:42,980
Surge's displacement in time for his own evil purposes.

3930
03:26:43,420 --> 03:26:46,060
So as you play through the game, like one of the coolest parts

3931
03:26:46,060 --> 03:26:48,780
is you get to have a lot of people in your party.

3932
03:26:48,780 --> 03:26:50,700
Now, it's only like the typical three person party,

3933
03:26:50,860 --> 03:26:53,900
but you can recruit up to 45 people and swap them in and out

3934
03:26:54,460 --> 03:26:56,060
pretty much however you please.

3935
03:26:56,060 --> 03:26:58,980
And they all have different, you know, base powers and things like that.

3936
03:27:00,140 --> 03:27:03,020
But the only way to obtain all 45 of those characters is to play

3937
03:27:03,380 --> 03:27:05,540
through the game three times.

3938
03:27:05,540 --> 03:27:08,540
And I beat this game five times, so I've gotten all the characters.

3939
03:27:10,820 --> 03:27:14,020
A lot of them have their own unique little dialog quirks to do this.

3940
03:27:14,020 --> 03:27:17,180
They coded a script generator to change the standard dialog

3941
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:19,340
for all these special characters so they wouldn't have to rewrite

3942
03:27:19,580 --> 03:27:21,940
and translate for all the different ones.

3943
03:27:21,940 --> 03:27:25,620
Another way that the Chrono Cross makes having so many playable characters work

3944
03:27:25,820 --> 03:27:29,340
is that it's a grind free RPG so you don't have to go grind all your characters.

3945
03:27:29,780 --> 03:27:32,140
Every recruit levels up after killing a boss

3946
03:27:32,380 --> 03:27:34,820
or fighting other key battles where you're rewarded with a star.

3947
03:27:34,820 --> 03:27:37,580
So every time you get a star, your whole party bumps up a level.

3948
03:27:37,580 --> 03:27:39,820
And that's kind of that's just another thing I love about the game.

3949
03:27:39,820 --> 03:27:42,780
I love that it's not your typical grindy JRPG.

3950
03:27:42,780 --> 03:27:46,340
You play through the game, boss to boss, and your party will always level.

3951
03:27:46,340 --> 03:27:48,780
You don't sit there and grind little rabbits in the field.

3952
03:27:49,940 --> 03:27:52,060
See, they also built the battle system from the ground up.

3953
03:27:52,060 --> 03:27:56,300
It doesn't use magic points because as you attack, you use stamina points.

3954
03:27:56,540 --> 03:27:57,700
And with each successful attack,

3955
03:27:57,700 --> 03:28:01,340
you gain access to higher tiered elements on your elemental grid.

3956
03:28:01,900 --> 03:28:04,660
Each element is tied to a color that affects the field of battle.

3957
03:28:04,820 --> 03:28:08,340
And those are tied to like basic elements, you know, like fire and water,

3958
03:28:08,900 --> 03:28:12,860
nature, earth and something else.

3959
03:28:14,140 --> 03:28:17,660
Let's see, based on how you manipulate the field, you can do more damage.

3960
03:28:17,980 --> 03:28:22,460
And that's kind of received some flack for the game

3961
03:28:22,460 --> 03:28:26,780
because it is easy in that sense, along with the whole grind free aspect of it.

3962
03:28:27,300 --> 03:28:29,500
The combat system is pretty easy to figure out.

3963
03:28:29,500 --> 03:28:32,540
And once you do and you can just manipulate the field,

3964
03:28:32,540 --> 03:28:34,940
you can own stuff like super fast in this game.

3965
03:28:35,820 --> 03:28:40,260
Let's see, it received extremely well by critics.

3966
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:45,500
It had a perfect 10 on GameSpot, 36 out of 40 on Famitsu and 97 on IGN.

3967
03:28:46,940 --> 03:28:48,940
The game shipped over a million and a half copies

3968
03:28:48,940 --> 03:28:50,940
and was rereleased as a greatest hits version.

3969
03:28:51,300 --> 03:28:54,180
It does have plenty of detractors, with the most common complaint

3970
03:28:54,180 --> 03:28:56,580
being it isn't Chrono Trigger 2.

3971
03:28:56,580 --> 03:28:59,620
The game's creators never intended it to be a true sequel to Chrono Trigger

3972
03:28:59,860 --> 03:29:04,300
as they wanted to build a new game from the ground up for this new platform.

3973
03:29:04,300 --> 03:29:07,740
You know, the PlayStation one that were not new at that point,

3974
03:29:07,740 --> 03:29:09,780
but new compared to Chrono Trigger.

3975
03:29:09,780 --> 03:29:11,980
They wanted they didn't want to just have another game

3976
03:29:11,980 --> 03:29:14,940
that looked like Chrono Trigger playing on the the PlayStation.

3977
03:29:16,020 --> 03:29:19,380
Well, plus, there was such a difference between Final Fantasy six and seven.

3978
03:29:19,380 --> 03:29:21,620
You know, Chrono made a very similar kind of jump.

3979
03:29:21,860 --> 03:29:25,220
And you know, in the game, I think also pissed off a lot of fans

3980
03:29:25,220 --> 03:29:29,620
because as you play the game, you realize some characters from Chrono Trigger died.

3981
03:29:29,940 --> 03:29:32,620
So you're like, oh, so that means there probably can never be a true

3982
03:29:32,620 --> 03:29:35,100
Chrono Trigger 2 because this person's dead.

3983
03:29:35,100 --> 03:29:36,140
But, you know, it's time travel.

3984
03:29:36,140 --> 03:29:39,300
So you never know. Chrono Trigger could come back maybe someday.

3985
03:29:39,300 --> 03:29:40,300
They could do whatever they want.

3986
03:29:40,300 --> 03:29:41,380
They could do whatever they want.

3987
03:29:41,380 --> 03:29:43,860
It's time travel and it's magic and who cares?

3988
03:29:44,460 --> 03:29:47,220
It's still a great game. Let's see.

3989
03:29:47,220 --> 03:29:51,260
Oh, yeah. OK. And then this is what I was going to end on was the music is the best.

3990
03:29:51,820 --> 03:29:53,220
Nobody can really complain about that.

3991
03:29:53,220 --> 03:29:54,420
It's my favorite part of the game.

3992
03:29:54,420 --> 03:29:56,340
And I got the soundtrack.

3993
03:29:56,340 --> 03:29:58,580
Like I said, the highlights are time scar.

3994
03:29:58,740 --> 03:30:00,340
And I love magical dreamers.

3995
03:30:00,340 --> 03:30:01,660
I love the end credits song.

3996
03:30:01,940 --> 03:30:05,780
And yeah, just the kind of game you can just sit and listen to the music to.

3997
03:30:05,780 --> 03:30:09,260
If you you can just leave it on that menu screen and just let it go.

3998
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:11,180
And that's just time scar over and over and over.

3999
03:30:11,180 --> 03:30:12,700
Attract mode. Yeah.

4000
03:30:12,700 --> 03:30:16,140
On Chrono Trigger, I used to let it sit in zeal

4001
03:30:16,620 --> 03:30:19,300
and just play that music over and over again.

4002
03:30:19,580 --> 03:30:21,220
And Charlotte's music.

4003
03:30:21,220 --> 03:30:22,860
Yeah. Oh, Charlotte seems my favorite.

4004
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:24,460
Yeah. I love that.

4005
03:30:24,460 --> 03:30:26,460
They kept just that awesome.

4006
03:30:26,460 --> 03:30:30,180
This musical style was it kept the same style, at least.

4007
03:30:30,420 --> 03:30:32,500
And she plays a big role in Chrono Cross.

4008
03:30:33,300 --> 03:30:35,220
You know, I never got that far into it.

4009
03:30:35,220 --> 03:30:36,980
Oh, you know what, though?

4010
03:30:36,980 --> 03:30:41,700
But I've got another it's another critique of the game that it's almost like they

4011
03:30:41,700 --> 03:30:45,420
didn't they could have changed one little thing about a certain character in Chrono

4012
03:30:45,420 --> 03:30:47,100
Cross, and I think it would have made a huge difference

4013
03:30:47,820 --> 03:30:50,340
to maybe fans of Chrono Trigger and Charlotte.

4014
03:30:51,220 --> 03:30:52,580
But I guess you got to play it.

4015
03:30:52,580 --> 03:30:55,940
I'm not going to spoil it, even though this game is like 12 years old or whatever.

4016
03:30:56,580 --> 03:30:57,740
All right. Well, there it is.

4017
03:30:57,740 --> 03:31:01,300
Your classic game of the May classic game in the May Chrono Cross.

4018
03:31:01,300 --> 03:31:02,020
Thank you for that.

4019
03:31:02,020 --> 03:31:04,220
I'm glad you finally got to give give the game.

4020
03:31:04,220 --> 03:31:06,340
It's due here. I love this game.

4021
03:31:06,340 --> 03:31:09,620
I know we all love the game.

4022
03:31:09,620 --> 03:31:10,820
We're going to open up the Skype line.

4023
03:31:10,820 --> 03:31:13,780
We don't have a whole lot of time for calls tonight because we're running very long.

4024
03:31:13,780 --> 03:31:15,380
It's damn near a four hour show tonight.

4025
03:31:15,380 --> 03:31:18,180
So one eight seven seven game O.L.R.

4026
03:31:18,180 --> 03:31:20,020
or is your name on Skype is Orange Laundry.

4027
03:31:20,020 --> 03:31:22,020
All one word. If you want to give us a call

4028
03:31:22,020 --> 03:31:25,340
and we will take some of your calls, we will do the listless results here shortly.

4029
03:31:25,340 --> 03:31:27,540
I just want to give it one more minute for votes

4030
03:31:27,820 --> 03:31:29,820
because we have a massive tie going on right now.

4031
03:31:29,820 --> 03:31:31,460
So I just want to see if that tie will get broken.

4032
03:31:31,460 --> 03:31:33,700
But it doesn't look likely at this point.

4033
03:31:33,700 --> 03:31:34,500
So we'll see.

4034
03:31:34,500 --> 03:31:38,300
I'm also going to do tweets real quick here at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R..

4035
03:31:38,780 --> 03:31:40,300
But I need my iPad for that.

4036
03:31:40,300 --> 03:31:42,100
So, Loki, do you have any last minute story?

4037
03:31:42,100 --> 03:31:43,780
Probably not, huh? No, I do.

4038
03:31:43,780 --> 03:31:45,700
Oh, OK. I have one.

4039
03:31:45,700 --> 03:31:48,860
Oh, Rob, see, this is kind of this is kind of sad, actually.

4040
03:31:49,140 --> 03:31:50,500
You may remember the last few years.

4041
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:53,140
We haven't had a new NBA game, NBA elite.

4042
03:31:53,140 --> 03:31:59,020
Well, NBA, NBA, NBA game like NBA live or NBA elite or whatever you can call it.

4043
03:31:59,660 --> 03:32:04,020
So NBA Live 10, the last NBA game released by EA

4044
03:32:04,620 --> 03:32:08,460
is going to have its online support shut down January 11th.

4045
03:32:09,220 --> 03:32:13,220
So if you're still playing NBA live, you're done.

4046
03:32:13,220 --> 03:32:16,300
But go act really angry on the Internet, because apparently that works.

4047
03:32:16,300 --> 03:32:17,700
It worked with GameSpy.

4048
03:32:17,700 --> 03:32:20,140
You never know. All right. We have a call on the line. Let's get to it.

4049
03:32:20,140 --> 03:32:23,020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hello, it's Shane.

4050
03:32:23,020 --> 03:32:25,220
Hey, Shane, how you doing? I'm good.

4051
03:32:25,540 --> 03:32:28,420
Did you like the Konami stories that Jim was telling us earlier?

4052
03:32:28,420 --> 03:32:32,380
There are so many other ones that are really funny that he missed.

4053
03:32:32,380 --> 03:32:35,620
Like the fact there was the one guy

4054
03:32:35,620 --> 03:32:38,700
when we were doing karaoke revolution that couldn't sing at all.

4055
03:32:39,060 --> 03:32:41,980
And nobody could be in the same room with him while he tested

4056
03:32:41,980 --> 03:32:43,700
because we would all laugh too hard.

4057
03:32:43,700 --> 03:32:46,860
So we'd have to go other places like me and one of the guys had to go

4058
03:32:46,860 --> 03:32:49,780
in the storage closet because we wanted to laugh so hard at it.

4059
03:32:51,140 --> 03:32:52,260
I forgot about that.

4060
03:32:52,260 --> 03:32:54,580
There was a guy that was so bad at karaoke revolution.

4061
03:32:54,580 --> 03:32:57,860
It sent you back in the closet. Yes. All right. Amazing.

4062
03:32:57,860 --> 03:33:00,380
All right. What did you really call in to talk about tonight?

4063
03:33:00,380 --> 03:33:04,100
One, you did not pick the right number one for your list list

4064
03:33:04,100 --> 03:33:07,740
as I gave you a better number one that is probably more likely to happen

4065
03:33:07,740 --> 03:33:11,020
than anything on the list list. What would what would that answer be?

4066
03:33:11,940 --> 03:33:15,540
Verbatim, I put your number one will be Shane will find a game

4067
03:33:15,540 --> 03:33:19,020
he loves and gets Rob and Jamie to fall madly in love with it as well.

4068
03:33:20,900 --> 03:33:23,540
Only if it's more mass effect.

4069
03:33:23,540 --> 03:33:27,380
That's what you say now until I find something he's trying with persona

4070
03:33:27,380 --> 03:33:28,940
and I'm like, no, no, not yet.

4071
03:33:28,940 --> 03:33:32,900
I will not try yet until I beat it, but it will happen. Whatever.

4072
03:33:33,460 --> 03:33:34,420
It's really, really good.

4073
03:33:34,420 --> 03:33:35,780
Not worked with Skylanders.

4074
03:33:35,780 --> 03:33:36,540
I'm not doing that.

4075
03:33:36,540 --> 03:33:39,620
I'm not going to try to get you into Skylanders.

4076
03:33:39,620 --> 03:33:40,740
I promise. All right.

4077
03:33:40,740 --> 03:33:43,780
I don't want to be into Skylanders. All right.

4078
03:33:44,620 --> 03:33:47,580
You know what I was really going to say is and something

4079
03:33:47,620 --> 03:33:49,420
I think we talked about before

4080
03:33:49,420 --> 03:33:53,060
is that when I was doing my own, like, what games did I love this year?

4081
03:33:53,300 --> 03:33:56,100
My top five, four of them were Vita games,

4082
03:33:56,380 --> 03:33:58,820
which seemed a little ridiculous to me.

4083
03:33:58,820 --> 03:34:01,100
So just because the system kind of sucks

4084
03:34:01,460 --> 03:34:04,100
doesn't mean that the games are awful, too.

4085
03:34:04,620 --> 03:34:07,620
Let me guess that must be luminous persona.

4086
03:34:07,940 --> 03:34:09,780
Mm hmm. Gravity Rush.

4087
03:34:09,780 --> 03:34:11,780
Nope. What else? I didn't beat the game yet.

4088
03:34:11,780 --> 03:34:13,900
So sound shapes.

4089
03:34:13,900 --> 03:34:15,780
Oh, yes. Sound shapes really good.

4090
03:34:15,780 --> 03:34:19,580
And what? Um, and D.J. Maxx. Oh, OK.

4091
03:34:20,460 --> 03:34:21,420
Yeah, I guess that's true.

4092
03:34:21,420 --> 03:34:23,380
Those are all still really great games.

4093
03:34:23,380 --> 03:34:26,540
Yeah. And PlayStation Plus makes it easier because I got four games

4094
03:34:26,540 --> 03:34:29,540
from PlayStation Plus now on there, too, that I can play and love.

4095
03:34:29,620 --> 03:34:32,100
This is the part of the year where all the websites

4096
03:34:32,100 --> 03:34:33,900
are doing their best and worst to 2012.

4097
03:34:33,900 --> 03:34:36,500
And like Yahoo, I don't know why I read Yahoo, but I do.

4098
03:34:36,820 --> 03:34:39,540
They have their worst of 2012 in tech.

4099
03:34:39,540 --> 03:34:41,340
And the Vita inevitably made the list.

4100
03:34:41,340 --> 03:34:43,980
And there's a lot of websites where the Vita made the worst in tech list.

4101
03:34:43,980 --> 03:34:46,580
But yet, yet we have the golden rule of gaming.

4102
03:34:46,580 --> 03:34:48,380
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

4103
03:34:48,380 --> 03:34:51,100
If the games are so good on the Vita, why is the Vita flopping?

4104
03:34:52,420 --> 03:34:53,820
The price sucks.

4105
03:34:53,820 --> 03:35:00,060
And as you know, Flacco Jones says the the first party games

4106
03:35:00,060 --> 03:35:03,580
that should be made by their actual devs are not.

4107
03:35:03,580 --> 03:35:06,060
And so they're not as good with the exceptional big planet.

4108
03:35:06,060 --> 03:35:07,900
I think that game is fun on Vita.

4109
03:35:07,900 --> 03:35:09,060
I really like it on Vita.

4110
03:35:09,060 --> 03:35:10,380
Yeah, a little bit of Vita.

4111
03:35:10,380 --> 03:35:13,500
But God, I'm tired from that, isn't it?

4112
03:35:13,900 --> 03:35:15,900
They were still involved in some capacity.

4113
03:35:15,900 --> 03:35:17,460
And I think that was important.

4114
03:35:17,460 --> 03:35:21,260
Uncharted feels like a bad cell phone knockoff of Uncharted.

4115
03:35:21,380 --> 03:35:22,500
Yeah, it's terrible.

4116
03:35:22,500 --> 03:35:26,140
Yeah, that was a big that was almost on my disappointing list,

4117
03:35:26,140 --> 03:35:28,460
but I didn't really play enough of it to really say that.

4118
03:35:28,460 --> 03:35:30,660
You don't need to just play like five minutes

4119
03:35:30,660 --> 03:35:35,220
and then try to do one of the stupid rubbings or aiming in that game

4120
03:35:35,500 --> 03:35:37,060
or climbing with the touch screen.

4121
03:35:37,060 --> 03:35:38,060
That's terrible, too.

4122
03:35:38,060 --> 03:35:39,500
We were talking about this earlier.

4123
03:35:39,500 --> 03:35:42,780
What would you say was your most disappointing of 2012?

4124
03:35:43,980 --> 03:35:45,740
My game's Guild Wars, too.

4125
03:35:45,740 --> 03:35:48,340
I just it was not as good as I was expecting

4126
03:35:48,340 --> 03:35:51,300
with all the time and effort they put into it.

4127
03:35:52,540 --> 03:35:54,860
I would even throw in Mr. Pandaria.

4128
03:35:55,300 --> 03:35:58,980
I have way too many issues with this game, this expansion.

4129
03:36:00,100 --> 03:36:03,380
I will also say, oh, God, what else did I tell you?

4130
03:36:03,420 --> 03:36:05,460
I told you uncharted because I thought that was really bad.

4131
03:36:05,460 --> 03:36:07,380
Both uncharted, uncharted three.

4132
03:36:07,380 --> 03:36:09,140
Or was that last year?

4133
03:36:09,140 --> 03:36:10,380
I don't know. It wasn't good either.

4134
03:36:10,380 --> 03:36:11,740
Uncharted three was last year.

4135
03:36:11,740 --> 03:36:15,620
OK, well, it's terribleness bled over into this year, too.

4136
03:36:16,940 --> 03:36:19,820
And you know what?

4137
03:36:19,820 --> 03:36:23,020
And this is going to be terrible coming from me,

4138
03:36:23,020 --> 03:36:27,300
but I'm slightly disappointed with the latest Pokemon game

4139
03:36:27,300 --> 03:36:28,540
because it didn't hold my interest.

4140
03:36:28,540 --> 03:36:30,740
I haven't even beaten it yet.

4141
03:36:30,740 --> 03:36:32,180
Wow. Pokemon.

4142
03:36:32,180 --> 03:36:34,580
I kind of can't believe that you would say that.

4143
03:36:34,580 --> 03:36:39,340
I know I only have five badges and there are like too many other games

4144
03:36:39,380 --> 03:36:44,020
I'd rather play than Pokemon right now, which is very depressing to me.

4145
03:36:44,260 --> 03:36:46,980
Somebody put Pokemon White 2 as their game of the year.

4146
03:36:48,020 --> 03:36:50,500
Well, that's their wrong opinion.

4147
03:36:50,500 --> 03:36:53,980
That's cool. How did I know you were going to say something like that?

4148
03:36:54,340 --> 03:36:55,620
All right. Because I'm a jerk.

4149
03:36:55,620 --> 03:36:57,380
Well, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

4150
03:36:58,100 --> 03:37:01,980
Um, no, I don't think so.

4151
03:37:01,980 --> 03:37:03,020
I was trying to think of another funny

4152
03:37:03,020 --> 03:37:06,140
Konami story before I got off the Skype.

4153
03:37:06,140 --> 03:37:10,980
But I oh, one of the times where we went drinking at lunch,

4154
03:37:11,620 --> 03:37:14,380
somebody in the room I sat in,

4155
03:37:15,500 --> 03:37:16,780
they drank too much.

4156
03:37:16,780 --> 03:37:18,940
So they got sent home early.

4157
03:37:18,940 --> 03:37:22,300
And then as a sign of solidarity, I left early, too.

4158
03:37:23,460 --> 03:37:25,460
As a sign of solidarity.

4159
03:37:25,460 --> 03:37:29,300
It also was on a Friday, so it wasn't that bad of an idea.

4160
03:37:29,820 --> 03:37:31,860
All right. All right.

4161
03:37:31,860 --> 03:37:33,420
That's it. I'm going to let you go.

4162
03:37:33,420 --> 03:37:36,340
You can tell more stories when you come to California and guest on the show again.

4163
03:37:36,860 --> 03:37:39,420
OK. All right. Bye bye.

4164
03:37:39,420 --> 03:37:40,580
We can probably fit in one more call.

4165
03:37:40,580 --> 03:37:43,980
One eight seven seven game or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

4166
03:37:43,980 --> 03:37:45,260
Were you doing with last minute stories?

4167
03:37:45,260 --> 03:37:47,340
Loki, are you good?

4168
03:37:47,340 --> 03:37:49,140
I'm good. All right.

4169
03:37:49,140 --> 03:37:51,860
Reading some of the tweets at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.

4170
03:37:52,500 --> 03:37:53,140
SGA 100.

4171
03:37:53,140 --> 03:37:55,060
Matt tweeted us saying I won't be listening tonight

4172
03:37:55,060 --> 03:37:57,180
because I will be seeing The Hobbit for my birthday.

4173
03:37:57,300 --> 03:37:58,220
Happy birthday, by the way.

4174
03:37:58,220 --> 03:38:00,380
Well, and I'm kidding.

4175
03:38:00,380 --> 03:38:01,380
But I will be birthday.

4176
03:38:01,420 --> 03:38:03,500
I hope you like 10 minutes of dwarves singing.

4177
03:38:03,500 --> 03:38:04,740
No, I'm just kidding. I haven't seen it yet.

4178
03:38:04,740 --> 03:38:05,860
I'm not going to hate.

4179
03:38:05,860 --> 03:38:07,900
But I would like to wish you all a happy new year.

4180
03:38:07,900 --> 03:38:09,620
Well, happy new year to you, too.

4181
03:38:09,620 --> 03:38:12,340
And happy birthday. Let's see.

4182
03:38:13,860 --> 03:38:17,820
Act Def tweeted us wanting us to know that Austin Wintory of the Journey

4183
03:38:17,820 --> 03:38:22,580
soundtrack fame released all his music on Bandcamp for Pay What You Want.

4184
03:38:23,020 --> 03:38:25,500
Austin Wintory dot Bandcamp dot com.

4185
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:29,740
That's pretty awesome and great soundtrack for Journey, by the way.

4186
03:38:30,140 --> 03:38:32,980
Oh, also, I did want to say there is another game that is up

4187
03:38:32,980 --> 03:38:37,580
on the top of my list is Street Fighter across Mega Man.

4188
03:38:38,180 --> 03:38:39,580
Oh, yeah, the the fan one.

4189
03:38:39,580 --> 03:38:41,220
But the music. Mm hmm.

4190
03:38:41,220 --> 03:38:44,020
You can also get the soundtrack as a pay what you want. Nice.

4191
03:38:44,020 --> 03:38:45,820
And I have the whole thing

4192
03:38:45,820 --> 03:38:48,660
burned it off for my husband and put it in his stocking. Very cool.

4193
03:38:48,700 --> 03:38:50,900
All right. Well, let's go to the phones.

4194
03:38:50,900 --> 03:38:52,940
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

4195
03:38:52,940 --> 03:38:54,140
It's the one and only Rama.

4196
03:38:54,140 --> 03:38:56,700
Hey, Rama. Rama, I was thinking of you.

4197
03:38:57,380 --> 03:38:59,180
Oh, I was thinking of you, too.

4198
03:38:59,180 --> 03:39:02,060
Because we need to, like, get online and watch Dirty Pair.

4199
03:39:04,220 --> 03:39:07,020
That, too. Do you know how much frickin' anime I have sitting on my shelf

4200
03:39:07,020 --> 03:39:08,860
I've bought over the years and get to watch?

4201
03:39:11,060 --> 03:39:13,420
I just finished the first season of Sailor Moon.

4202
03:39:13,420 --> 03:39:14,780
What does that tell you?

4203
03:39:14,780 --> 03:39:18,420
Really? I've watched like the whole run of it three times now.

4204
03:39:19,580 --> 03:39:22,700
In Japanese. Just imagine how many people are going to be watching it

4205
03:39:22,700 --> 03:39:24,820
right before the premiere of new series.

4206
03:39:24,820 --> 03:39:27,500
I need to be on anime jam session, dude.

4207
03:39:27,500 --> 03:39:28,780
It's going to happen.

4208
03:39:28,780 --> 03:39:32,460
Episode 100 is coming soon, and we got some shit in store, you know?

4209
03:39:32,540 --> 03:39:35,500
Nice. Mm hmm. Very cool.

4210
03:39:35,500 --> 03:39:37,580
Well, what to what do we owe this phone call tonight?

4211
03:39:38,300 --> 03:39:41,660
Oh, the whole Shame Stop debacle.

4212
03:39:41,660 --> 03:39:43,660
Oh, you talk about the porn thing?

4213
03:39:44,940 --> 03:39:48,700
I'm sorry. I have to laugh when Shame Stop says they have

4214
03:39:49,020 --> 03:39:52,980
standards and practices on their refurbished machine consoles.

4215
03:39:53,180 --> 03:39:55,940
I'm sorry. How can you call it refurbished

4216
03:39:55,980 --> 03:39:59,660
when I walk in and sell it and 10 minutes later,

4217
03:39:59,700 --> 03:40:01,940
someone comes in and buys what I just sold you.

4218
03:40:01,940 --> 03:40:04,540
That's not refurbished.

4219
03:40:04,540 --> 03:40:08,100
Standards and practices is the firing department, let's be real.

4220
03:40:09,580 --> 03:40:10,620
Standards and practices.

4221
03:40:10,620 --> 03:40:12,100
Q and reset the whole nine yards.

4222
03:40:12,100 --> 03:40:14,140
I mean, they don't really care.

4223
03:40:14,140 --> 03:40:17,460
I mean, I sold them ideas fat with a broken L button.

4224
03:40:17,460 --> 03:40:19,380
They didn't give it to him.

4225
03:40:20,940 --> 03:40:23,340
I should have sold them my broken iPhone,

4226
03:40:23,340 --> 03:40:26,540
but I ended up giving that to my dad because he'll try to fix it knowing him.

4227
03:40:27,420 --> 03:40:29,340
All they're going to do is turn it on.

4228
03:40:29,340 --> 03:40:31,860
See the power's up. That's it. Done.

4229
03:40:33,300 --> 03:40:35,580
Wow. Easy enough.

4230
03:40:36,500 --> 03:40:38,980
Exactly. And this is why I do not.

4231
03:40:39,220 --> 03:40:41,580
I try not to shop there unless I truly had to.

4232
03:40:41,860 --> 03:40:45,140
Last time I went there, I bought NCIS for my 3DS.

4233
03:40:45,260 --> 03:40:47,420
Come to find out if I waited an extra day,

4234
03:40:47,420 --> 03:40:49,660
I could have gotten it from Nintendo World for the same price.

4235
03:40:50,660 --> 03:40:53,740
Yikes. What's been your favorite in gaming this year?

4236
03:40:54,500 --> 03:40:57,540
Well, like I said, it was Final Fantasy Theater rhythm,

4237
03:40:57,700 --> 03:41:00,660
but it was a toss up between that and Mario Kart 7,

4238
03:41:00,660 --> 03:41:02,780
because, you know, I love my Mario Kart.

4239
03:41:02,780 --> 03:41:04,580
Mario Kart's good times.

4240
03:41:04,580 --> 03:41:07,100
Yes, especially when we were playing during the breaks.

4241
03:41:07,300 --> 03:41:09,060
You have to bring that back.

4242
03:41:09,060 --> 03:41:10,780
Especially on it.

4243
03:41:10,780 --> 03:41:12,340
I almost said it on a jam session.

4244
03:41:12,340 --> 03:41:14,540
You probably play it on there, too, but to automate conventions.

4245
03:41:14,740 --> 03:41:18,900
I'm sure there's lots of breakouts of various DS titles and so forth.

4246
03:41:19,460 --> 03:41:23,220
Yeah, I mostly see it Mario Kart or Tetris.

4247
03:41:23,620 --> 03:41:25,700
Right now, the big thing is Pokemon.

4248
03:41:25,700 --> 03:41:27,460
That's what everyone is doing.

4249
03:41:27,460 --> 03:41:28,740
So very cool.

4250
03:41:29,740 --> 03:41:31,300
What about disappointing games this year?

4251
03:41:31,300 --> 03:41:33,140
Is there anything you want to call out as disappointing?

4252
03:41:33,940 --> 03:41:37,940
Oh, well, I didn't play a lot of games this year,

4253
03:41:37,940 --> 03:41:41,220
but I don't think there was anything disappointing.

4254
03:41:41,220 --> 03:41:46,140
But if I have to, I have to join the bandwagon and say Assassin's Creed 3.

4255
03:41:47,420 --> 03:41:47,940
Why that?

4256
03:41:47,940 --> 03:41:50,540
Because there were some people that said Assassin's Creed 3 was the best.

4257
03:41:50,820 --> 03:41:52,620
So why do you put it as most disappointing?

4258
03:41:53,420 --> 03:41:58,260
From my understanding, not just ending, but the gameplay mechanics.

4259
03:41:58,260 --> 03:41:59,660
Some people say it was really horrible.

4260
03:42:00,540 --> 03:42:01,100
Gotcha.

4261
03:42:02,500 --> 03:42:04,940
All right, well, we're going to let you go.

4262
03:42:04,940 --> 03:42:07,180
But good luck with your show in 2013.

4263
03:42:07,180 --> 03:42:08,300
Good luck with Anime Jam Session.

4264
03:42:08,300 --> 03:42:09,620
I look forward to episode 100.

4265
03:42:09,620 --> 03:42:14,700
And when you guys inevitably go live at some point, right?

4266
03:42:15,460 --> 03:42:19,260
That's, well, I might as well say, well, that's part of what we're working on for 100

4267
03:42:19,260 --> 03:42:23,420
because of all the extra equipment I've been buying over the last couple of weeks to get things going.

4268
03:42:23,660 --> 03:42:24,300
Nice.

4269
03:42:24,300 --> 03:42:26,300
So it sounds like we'll be chatting in the coming weeks.

4270
03:42:26,820 --> 03:42:28,060
Oh, you got that right.

4271
03:42:28,060 --> 03:42:28,780
All righty.

4272
03:42:28,940 --> 03:42:29,260
All right.

4273
03:42:29,260 --> 03:42:29,820
Take care, buddy.

4274
03:42:29,820 --> 03:42:31,380
Have a good, have a safe new year.

4275
03:42:31,980 --> 03:42:32,540
You too.

4276
03:42:32,540 --> 03:42:33,820
And stay fabulous.

4277
03:42:33,820 --> 03:42:34,700
And don't get too drunk.

4278
03:42:34,700 --> 03:42:35,260
I will.

4279
03:42:35,260 --> 03:42:35,980
Stay black.

4280
03:42:36,980 --> 03:42:37,740
You got that right.

4281
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:38,100
All right.

4282
03:42:38,740 --> 03:42:39,260
Bye, buddy.

4283
03:42:39,660 --> 03:42:40,260
Bye.

4284
03:42:40,660 --> 03:42:41,300
All right.

4285
03:42:41,300 --> 03:42:41,820
All right.

4286
03:43:11,300 --> 03:43:15,220
An interview with the producer Brad Foxhoven, former producer in IGN.

4287
03:43:15,700 --> 03:43:18,740
Nintendo surprisingly gave its blessing to the project.

4288
03:43:19,140 --> 03:43:22,940
But, you know, because obviously they didn't like Super Mario Brothers at first.

4289
03:43:22,940 --> 03:43:24,580
But they thought with John Woo it would be better.

4290
03:43:24,900 --> 03:43:27,620
But I guess they couldn't do it.

4291
03:43:27,620 --> 03:43:32,140
And a lot of it had to do with Samus' backstory that they wanted to explore, making a movie about her.

4292
03:43:32,140 --> 03:43:37,860
But Nintendo, I guess, wanted to be the ones to answer those questions, not have it answered in a movie.

4293
03:43:38,540 --> 03:43:39,660
Let's go to one more call.

4294
03:43:39,660 --> 03:43:41,420
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

4295
03:43:41,420 --> 03:43:42,060
Who's this?

4296
03:43:42,580 --> 03:43:43,220
Hey, what's up?

4297
03:43:43,220 --> 03:43:43,940
It's Tiger Claw.

4298
03:43:43,940 --> 03:43:45,100
Hey, Tiger Claw.

4299
03:43:45,100 --> 03:43:46,500
And it's video.

4300
03:43:46,500 --> 03:43:51,020
Just like, remember I said, I remember I said a couple of weeks ago that I wanted to get more video calls.

4301
03:43:51,180 --> 03:43:54,140
And we even have the cam, which we need to get on the show.

4302
03:43:54,140 --> 03:43:55,460
But maybe in 2013.

4303
03:43:55,460 --> 03:43:57,580
Well, how you do, Tiger Claw?

4304
03:43:58,140 --> 03:43:59,580
Oh, I'm doing fine.

4305
03:44:00,060 --> 03:44:07,580
Earlier in the show, you guys mentioned about the VOG Network Leaderboard and stuff and how I'm still in the top on there.

4306
03:44:07,620 --> 03:44:08,380
That's right.

4307
03:44:08,780 --> 03:44:12,140
He's number one for the year, if you look at like overall score, I believe.

4308
03:44:12,140 --> 03:44:12,980
Is he really?

4309
03:44:12,980 --> 03:44:14,260
I think so.

4310
03:44:14,260 --> 03:44:17,060
I worry on Bobby Black Wolf telling me all that stuff.

4311
03:44:17,060 --> 03:44:19,620
But no, I wanted you to call in and talk some shit.

4312
03:44:19,620 --> 03:44:20,460
And here you are.

4313
03:44:20,460 --> 03:44:21,380
This is great.

4314
03:44:21,540 --> 03:44:24,020
So are you here to trash talk Flaco Jones a little bit?

4315
03:44:24,820 --> 03:44:29,180
I just want to know is how has he managed to get first place?

4316
03:44:29,180 --> 03:44:32,780
Because I don't know where he's getting all those extra points.

4317
03:44:32,940 --> 03:44:37,580
He's doing it because he gets a lot of people somehow to reply to his comments.

4318
03:44:38,380 --> 03:44:39,820
I do a lot of comments.

4319
03:44:39,820 --> 03:44:41,020
He does so many comments.

4320
03:44:41,020 --> 03:44:42,860
He gets people to like him and reply to him.

4321
03:44:42,860 --> 03:44:44,020
And I think that's how he's doing it.

4322
03:44:44,140 --> 03:44:44,980
That's how I do it.

4323
03:44:45,980 --> 03:44:56,300
But he may have to change up his strategy in 2013 because there is going to be some not so much changes, but just, you know, we've been promising we're going to change up the game a little bit.

4324
03:44:56,460 --> 03:45:00,100
And so the game will be evolving in 2013.

4325
03:45:00,300 --> 03:45:02,500
So the game has changed.

4326
03:45:02,500 --> 03:45:03,060
That's right.

4327
03:45:03,060 --> 03:45:04,340
The game has changed.

4328
03:45:05,340 --> 03:45:07,340
It sure it definitely did.

4329
03:45:08,900 --> 03:45:21,460
But anyways, for anyone out there that wants to try to get their hands at the leaderboard, all you have to do is one simple thing is to basically go to the website every single day.

4330
03:45:21,660 --> 03:45:22,300
That is all.

4331
03:45:23,180 --> 03:45:25,140
Check in all the check in all the shows.

4332
03:45:25,900 --> 03:45:36,620
Check in all the shows every day, because there will be a day where you'll get a you'll get a loot for actually visiting the site every day.

4333
03:45:37,220 --> 03:45:40,700
Don't go giving away all the game secret and all that stuff.

4334
03:45:40,980 --> 03:45:43,460
And it's a good thing you're revamping the game.

4335
03:45:43,980 --> 03:45:44,500
It's a good thing.

4336
03:45:44,500 --> 03:45:45,860
The game's shifting a little bit.

4337
03:45:45,980 --> 03:45:47,780
We've already said all the strategies tonight.

4338
03:45:48,500 --> 03:45:48,700
Yeah.

4339
03:45:48,700 --> 03:45:51,500
And also, please like people's comments.

4340
03:45:51,500 --> 03:46:05,660
And here's another thing is if someone writes a comment saying that it was a good show, whatever you should like it, there's something positive about your show.

4341
03:46:06,300 --> 03:46:10,860
I think it deserves a like, I think.

4342
03:46:10,860 --> 03:46:15,540
I think any replies with lots of good substance are worthy of a like comment.

4343
03:46:15,540 --> 03:46:16,780
I like and reply.

4344
03:46:16,780 --> 03:46:17,820
Tyler Claus last.

4345
03:46:17,820 --> 03:46:18,820
That was a really good show.

4346
03:46:19,420 --> 03:46:23,900
I like this call that won't get you anything, but it might in 2013.

4347
03:46:23,900 --> 03:46:24,740
So stay tuned.

4348
03:46:25,500 --> 03:46:26,740
New ways to play.

4349
03:46:28,020 --> 03:46:35,180
And hopefully in the future, which I know you guys are planning, maybe you'll get loot for posting in forums or something like that.

4350
03:46:35,180 --> 03:46:36,780
I could you never know.

4351
03:46:36,780 --> 03:46:40,180
We don't want to encourage post touring, but we do want to encourage participation.

4352
03:46:40,180 --> 03:46:41,860
So there's a you never know.

4353
03:46:41,860 --> 03:46:42,980
You never know what might happen with that.

4354
03:46:43,140 --> 03:46:49,980
But since you kind of brought up the whole vog thing and all that I did at some point since it is the last live show of the year and so forth.

4355
03:46:50,260 --> 03:46:56,180
There were a lot of changes this year, obviously, that, you know, they could have gone many different ways.

4356
03:46:56,180 --> 03:47:03,380
And you guys really kind of embraced this whole vog idea, which in many ways was fucking insane to be doing.

4357
03:47:03,460 --> 03:47:05,340
But so many of you guys have just embraced it.

4358
03:47:05,340 --> 03:47:09,740
And like you and Flaco both just kind of, you know, running with the game.

4359
03:47:09,740 --> 03:47:15,700
And not just you guys, you know, like Act Deaf, Immortal King, all those guys you see, they're just hopping the leaderboards and everybody has been participating.

4360
03:47:16,220 --> 03:47:18,340
It's just been so fun.

4361
03:47:18,340 --> 03:47:21,180
And we can't wait to just kind of like continue on that for 2013.

4362
03:47:21,180 --> 03:47:27,380
And I really want to thank everybody that's kind of jumped on board with vog in the hosting community as well.

4363
03:47:27,580 --> 03:47:33,340
Brad from Pod Culture, John from Critical Myth, Brian from British Invaders, Travis and Jess from Understation Live.

4364
03:47:34,340 --> 03:47:39,780
Rama from Anime Jam Session, Syl from Girls Gone Wow, myself twice.

4365
03:47:39,780 --> 03:47:44,380
But I really want to thank just everybody who's really jumped on board with all the other shows.

4366
03:47:44,380 --> 03:47:46,700
And we're hoping to expand the lineup even more in 2013.

4367
03:47:46,700 --> 03:47:48,540
And just everybody has been really excited about this.

4368
03:47:48,540 --> 03:47:49,540
We want to do more video.

4369
03:47:49,900 --> 03:47:51,620
There's so much more we want to do.

4370
03:47:51,620 --> 03:47:55,740
And we're just hoping we can get the resources to do it.

4371
03:47:55,740 --> 03:48:00,460
Speaking of the live video stuff, you've been recently broadcasting some live gameplay.

4372
03:48:00,900 --> 03:48:01,420
That's the thing.

4373
03:48:01,420 --> 03:48:02,460
It's a new thing we want to do.

4374
03:48:02,500 --> 03:48:04,580
It's a great way to promote and so forth.

4375
03:48:04,580 --> 03:48:04,820
Yeah.

4376
03:48:05,380 --> 03:48:08,620
And if I remember, Rob, didn't you get XCOM?

4377
03:48:08,620 --> 03:48:10,540
I don't know if you got it for PC or something.

4378
03:48:11,020 --> 03:48:13,660
I did play it on PlayStation 3.

4379
03:48:13,660 --> 03:48:15,940
I played it the week we didn't have a show.

4380
03:48:16,740 --> 03:48:21,580
I didn't play really a lot of it because I kind of decided it was something I wasn't like super into.

4381
03:48:21,580 --> 03:48:23,740
I'm just I'm so bad at tactical games.

4382
03:48:24,180 --> 03:48:24,780
I don't know.

4383
03:48:24,780 --> 03:48:27,660
I just also just kind of made me want the old ones again.

4384
03:48:27,660 --> 03:48:29,380
I was like, I don't want all this newfangled stuff.

4385
03:48:29,380 --> 03:48:30,700
Just give me the old XCOM game.

4386
03:48:31,020 --> 03:48:39,940
Next time you play it, you should name all the soldiers after people, you know, and then at some point when they die, you start feeling bad about it.

4387
03:48:40,100 --> 03:48:40,780
Dark soccer.

4388
03:48:40,780 --> 03:48:42,700
I just got shot in the face by an alien.

4389
03:48:42,700 --> 03:48:43,420
What am I going to do?

4390
03:48:43,420 --> 03:48:43,900
What am I going to do?

4391
03:48:43,900 --> 03:48:44,860
Die of dysentery.

4392
03:48:46,420 --> 03:48:49,220
It is kind of the new version of somebody dying of dysentery.

4393
03:48:49,340 --> 03:48:50,380
I'm getting a look.

4394
03:48:50,380 --> 03:48:52,020
This is this is why it's too bad.

4395
03:48:52,020 --> 03:48:53,420
We don't have the video yet, but soon.

4396
03:48:53,780 --> 03:48:55,140
Hey, two words.

4397
03:48:55,140 --> 03:48:55,500
What?

4398
03:48:55,540 --> 03:48:56,500
Bite me.

4399
03:48:56,540 --> 03:48:56,940
All right.

4400
03:48:57,500 --> 03:49:00,380
Tigerclaw, I should probably let you go so we can wrap up everything.

4401
03:49:00,380 --> 03:49:03,340
But I do want to thank you for your support with VoG and everything this year.

4402
03:49:03,340 --> 03:49:05,700
And do you have anything else you want to get out before we wrap up the show?

4403
03:49:06,260 --> 03:49:09,140
Well, I would like to wish you all a happy new year.

4404
03:49:09,300 --> 03:49:09,940
Same to you.

4405
03:49:09,940 --> 03:49:15,300
And just hoping for bigger and better things for VoG network in 2013.

4406
03:49:15,540 --> 03:49:16,540
It's already awesome.

4407
03:49:16,900 --> 03:49:17,740
No, yes, of course.

4408
03:49:17,740 --> 03:49:19,700
Bigger, bigger and better is always good.

4409
03:49:19,700 --> 03:49:20,460
Yes, we are.

4410
03:49:20,460 --> 03:49:22,260
We were striving for more in 2013.

4411
03:49:23,380 --> 03:49:24,340
All right, guys.

4412
03:49:24,340 --> 03:49:26,580
So I guess I'll see you later.

4413
03:49:26,620 --> 03:49:27,220
All right.

4414
03:49:27,220 --> 03:49:28,060
Take care, buddy.

4415
03:49:28,060 --> 03:49:29,580
Have a good have a safe new year.

4416
03:49:30,180 --> 03:49:30,540
All right.

4417
03:49:30,540 --> 03:49:31,100
You too.

4418
03:49:31,140 --> 03:49:31,460
All right.

4419
03:49:31,460 --> 03:49:31,900
Bye bye.

4420
03:49:32,540 --> 03:49:32,860
Bye.

4421
03:49:33,820 --> 03:49:36,300
That's a great way to close out the show, I think tonight.

4422
03:49:36,300 --> 03:49:37,780
Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

4423
03:49:37,780 --> 03:49:39,340
I do see the Skypline still lighting up.

4424
03:49:39,340 --> 03:49:40,700
Please consider sending an email.

4425
03:49:41,100 --> 03:49:43,100
Give Dark Sakura tons of shit to read next week.

4426
03:49:43,620 --> 03:49:47,020
Mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com.

4427
03:49:47,180 --> 03:49:48,820
He's killing you and then making you work.

4428
03:49:48,860 --> 03:49:51,980
Before I know first I got an alien to shoot you in the face.

4429
03:49:51,980 --> 03:49:54,140
All right, Rob, you're being a hoe bag.

4430
03:49:54,140 --> 03:49:55,100
I am being a hoe bag.

4431
03:49:55,100 --> 03:49:55,540
All right.

4432
03:49:55,740 --> 03:49:58,860
Before we wrap up the show, we have to reveal who won this list.

4433
03:49:59,580 --> 03:50:05,580
All right, here it is.

4434
03:50:05,580 --> 03:50:09,420
The top four as voted on you, the listeners.

4435
03:50:09,620 --> 03:50:12,940
This is a crazy situation, but we have a top four tonight because

4436
03:50:12,940 --> 03:50:15,900
we have a three way tie for second place.

4437
03:50:16,540 --> 03:50:17,380
So here it is.

4438
03:50:17,580 --> 03:50:20,660
The three answers you voted in second place tonight.

4439
03:50:21,260 --> 03:50:23,820
Final Fantasy 11 goes free to play.

4440
03:50:24,660 --> 03:50:26,740
Lots of fans of free stuff.

4441
03:50:27,580 --> 03:50:31,420
Uh, a Vita price drop before the one year anniversary.

4442
03:50:32,300 --> 03:50:33,740
Again, fans of cheap things.

4443
03:50:33,780 --> 03:50:34,060
All right.

4444
03:50:34,060 --> 03:50:34,420
What happened?

4445
03:50:34,540 --> 03:50:37,140
And, uh, I don't know what this says about cheap, but also

4446
03:50:37,140 --> 03:50:38,540
tying for second place tonight.

4447
03:50:38,860 --> 03:50:44,340
The Xbox lube is a hundred dollars with a commitment and the platinum live program.

4448
03:50:44,940 --> 03:50:45,580
So there it is.

4449
03:50:45,580 --> 03:50:50,820
They're all money related things, but the number one answer for 2013

4450
03:50:50,820 --> 03:50:55,020
predictions as voted by you, the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.

4451
03:50:55,700 --> 03:50:57,180
No PlayStation four.

4452
03:50:57,860 --> 03:50:58,700
There it is.

4453
03:51:00,300 --> 03:51:01,060
It is done.

4454
03:51:01,060 --> 03:51:02,700
Sign it, seal it, deliver it.

4455
03:51:02,700 --> 03:51:05,300
Tell Sony, wait and make it better.

4456
03:51:06,220 --> 03:51:07,180
Don't rush it.

4457
03:51:07,260 --> 03:51:08,100
Don't pull a Vita.

4458
03:51:08,100 --> 03:51:08,980
Don't pull a Vita.

4459
03:51:10,460 --> 03:51:11,020
All right.

4460
03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:15,500
Games, games, game developers, developers, developers.

4461
03:51:15,500 --> 03:51:15,900
Wait a minute.

4462
03:51:15,900 --> 03:51:16,300
Wrong show.

4463
03:51:16,300 --> 03:51:16,660
Sorry.

4464
03:51:17,100 --> 03:51:17,540
All right.

4465
03:51:17,900 --> 03:51:20,580
That is really going to wrap it up for us tonight.

4466
03:51:20,660 --> 03:51:23,620
Um, but not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

4467
03:51:23,940 --> 03:51:26,460
Uh, I want to thank Alan for being on the show tonight.

4468
03:51:26,460 --> 03:51:27,380
He's in the other room.

4469
03:51:27,380 --> 03:51:31,060
If he runs in here by chance, I'll let him say something, but Flaco, I'm

4470
03:51:31,060 --> 03:51:34,180
so happy you made it through a full show and not just that, but probably

4471
03:51:34,980 --> 03:51:36,660
might be our longest show of the year.

4472
03:51:36,660 --> 03:51:37,340
I know, right?

4473
03:51:37,340 --> 03:51:39,460
Well, we had to make up for not being here last week, but thank you.

4474
03:51:39,460 --> 03:51:41,940
I know you have to stay up late and you've got kids and you had

4475
03:51:41,940 --> 03:51:42,860
drove an hour to get here.

4476
03:51:42,860 --> 03:51:44,380
So at least I don't have to work tomorrow.

4477
03:51:44,460 --> 03:51:44,900
There you go.

4478
03:51:44,900 --> 03:51:46,900
So seriously, thank you for being here.

4479
03:51:47,260 --> 03:51:49,460
Um, and, uh, come back again when you can.

4480
03:51:50,260 --> 03:51:51,140
I'll try.

4481
03:51:51,140 --> 03:51:51,580
I'll try.

4482
03:51:51,580 --> 03:51:52,340
I love being here.

4483
03:51:52,420 --> 03:51:54,380
And thanks for being so enthusiastic about the network.

4484
03:51:54,380 --> 03:51:55,700
Like for real, like it means a lot.

4485
03:51:55,740 --> 03:51:57,940
Like you, you, I think I live on the website.

4486
03:51:58,740 --> 03:52:00,140
That's what we want people to do.

4487
03:52:00,140 --> 03:52:01,580
So you got to get great talking to everybody.

4488
03:52:01,580 --> 03:52:05,300
I need little Flaco's Flaco clones.

4489
03:52:05,340 --> 03:52:06,820
Actually, we have some other people to do too.

4490
03:52:06,820 --> 03:52:08,100
Obviously we just talked to tiger claw.

4491
03:52:08,100 --> 03:52:09,500
He's, he's pretty good about that too.

4492
03:52:09,500 --> 03:52:13,140
So, um, anyway, in all seriousness, have a great new year.

4493
03:52:13,180 --> 03:52:14,940
Do you have any final thoughts or listeners tonight?

4494
03:52:15,660 --> 03:52:18,980
Uh, watch community when it comes back.

4495
03:52:18,980 --> 03:52:19,980
It's my favorite show.

4496
03:52:20,380 --> 03:52:21,900
Your shirt is great, by the way.

4497
03:52:21,940 --> 03:52:23,100
The eight bit style.

4498
03:52:23,100 --> 03:52:25,740
I know that it's, it's from their web.

4499
03:52:25,780 --> 03:52:29,020
That's from the, the NBC website because it's a, it's an episode of

4500
03:52:29,020 --> 03:52:30,780
community, they're all in an eight bit game.

4501
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:33,540
They need the journey to the center of Hawthorne, but they need

4502
03:52:33,540 --> 03:52:35,300
to just shop Chevy chase out.

4503
03:52:35,340 --> 03:52:37,940
Well, he already left the show, so that's the best thing.

4504
03:52:37,940 --> 03:52:38,620
Watch this season.

4505
03:52:38,620 --> 03:52:40,820
Cause you realize at the end, he's going to leave the show.

4506
03:52:41,540 --> 03:52:42,940
The worst part of the show is going to be gone.

4507
03:52:42,940 --> 03:52:43,180
Of course.

4508
03:52:43,180 --> 03:52:45,620
It's probably going to cancel too, but all right.

4509
03:52:45,940 --> 03:52:47,620
It's the last season's running by the way.

4510
03:52:48,540 --> 03:52:50,900
Oh, it wasn't planned last season.

4511
03:52:50,900 --> 03:52:54,980
No, it was this, the office and parks and rec, I think are the last season.

4512
03:52:55,140 --> 03:52:55,860
No, not yet.

4513
03:52:55,860 --> 03:52:59,380
So I've been official, it's over, but it's not official.

4514
03:53:00,420 --> 03:53:00,700
Yeah.

4515
03:53:00,700 --> 03:53:03,140
30 rock is the one that's on his last season, but yeah, they're, they're

4516
03:53:03,140 --> 03:53:05,980
running, they're going to run their Christmas show in like March or

4517
03:53:05,980 --> 03:53:06,260
something.

4518
03:53:06,260 --> 03:53:08,260
It's, it's going to be bad, but I still love it.

4519
03:53:08,780 --> 03:53:13,540
Uh, why is the civic vampire saying yay, community Annie's boobs, Annie's

4520
03:53:13,540 --> 03:53:15,580
boobs, hashtag, hashtag Annie's boobs.

4521
03:53:15,580 --> 03:53:18,220
I thought he was talking about your wife and I was going to be a little

4522
03:53:18,220 --> 03:53:19,740
defensive for you because you left chat.

4523
03:53:19,740 --> 03:53:22,780
Annie's boobs is the name of a monkey on community.

4524
03:53:22,780 --> 03:53:24,140
Don't talk about his wife's boobs like that.

4525
03:53:24,140 --> 03:53:24,500
All right.

4526
03:53:25,140 --> 03:53:26,460
Anyhow, got to watch the show.

4527
03:53:26,460 --> 03:53:27,140
Got to watch the show.

4528
03:53:27,140 --> 03:53:28,180
Boobs are monkeys.

4529
03:53:28,180 --> 03:53:28,540
What?

4530
03:53:29,540 --> 03:53:31,820
You guys are all lost because you need to watch this.

4531
03:53:31,860 --> 03:53:32,860
No, I don't watch lost.

4532
03:53:34,380 --> 03:53:37,100
If Reggie looks like a monkey, then he looks like boobs.

4533
03:53:38,860 --> 03:53:39,780
We're bringing that back.

4534
03:53:41,060 --> 03:53:41,660
Loki.

4535
03:53:41,700 --> 03:53:43,100
Your final thought tonight?

4536
03:53:43,340 --> 03:53:46,260
Uh, my final thought is I'm going to be busy in 2013.

4537
03:53:47,260 --> 03:53:48,220
Busy bebs.

4538
03:53:48,700 --> 03:53:49,380
Dark soccer.

4539
03:53:49,380 --> 03:53:50,260
Your final thought tonight?

4540
03:53:52,620 --> 03:53:53,220
Monkeys.

4541
03:53:54,020 --> 03:53:57,900
My final thought tonight is, um, you know, as I always say, help us

4542
03:53:57,900 --> 03:54:00,740
spread the word about our show, about VOG.

4543
03:54:01,020 --> 03:54:02,220
Word of mouth is all we got.

4544
03:54:02,220 --> 03:54:04,180
So tell a friend about what you heard here.

4545
03:54:04,300 --> 03:54:07,340
Thank you to everybody who has helped make this year a success.

4546
03:54:07,340 --> 03:54:09,700
Thank you to everybody who supported us through big changes.

4547
03:54:09,900 --> 03:54:13,220
Thank you to everybody who's continued to support us, uh, supported other

4548
03:54:13,220 --> 03:54:17,180
projects, supported other indie shows, even if it's like not even a VOG show.

4549
03:54:17,180 --> 03:54:19,900
If it's just like an indie show, thank you for supporting podcasting.

4550
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:22,140
Cause some people try to say podcasting is dead.

4551
03:54:22,140 --> 03:54:24,620
And to that, I say, hell no.

4552
03:54:25,300 --> 03:54:28,740
As long as there is a microphone and a computer, nobody told me that.

4553
03:54:28,820 --> 03:54:30,100
I know I didn't get the memo.

4554
03:54:30,620 --> 03:54:33,500
So, uh, we'll be back to do it all again next year.

4555
03:54:34,380 --> 03:54:36,220
Episode 500 next year, you guys.

4556
03:54:36,300 --> 03:54:41,660
And maybe this by slim margins, although it's too likely, but

4557
03:54:42,020 --> 03:54:44,740
maybe win the podcast awards.

4558
03:54:44,900 --> 03:54:45,460
Oh yeah.

4559
03:54:45,460 --> 03:54:49,860
That's coming up soon too, but we didn't buy a ticket to the ceremony.

4560
03:54:49,860 --> 03:54:50,980
So I'm probably not going to win.

4561
03:54:52,100 --> 03:54:52,500
All right.

4562
03:54:52,500 --> 03:54:53,620
It's good to be nominated.

4563
03:54:53,660 --> 03:54:53,740
Yeah.

4564
03:54:53,740 --> 03:54:55,540
It's it's, it's great to be nominated.

4565
03:54:55,620 --> 03:54:56,580
It feels really good.

4566
03:54:56,940 --> 03:54:58,140
I'm in it to win it.

4567
03:54:58,740 --> 03:55:03,140
So buying a ticket gets you like how many more podcast award points to get there?

4568
03:55:03,180 --> 03:55:05,380
I'm not going to shade the whole thing.

4569
03:55:05,380 --> 03:55:06,820
It isn't, you know, it is what it is.

4570
03:55:06,820 --> 03:55:07,140
All right.

4571
03:55:07,780 --> 03:55:11,980
I, as long as an indie podcast wins, I will be happy and I'm

4572
03:55:11,980 --> 03:55:12,980
pretty sure one is going to win.

4573
03:55:13,300 --> 03:55:13,580
All right.

4574
03:55:13,580 --> 03:55:14,180
I'm in it to win it.

4575
03:55:14,380 --> 03:55:14,700
All right.

4576
03:55:14,700 --> 03:55:15,140
That's it.

4577
03:55:15,140 --> 03:55:15,540
We're done.

4578
03:55:15,540 --> 03:55:15,900
We're out.

4579
03:55:15,900 --> 03:55:16,260
Good night.

4580
03:55:16,260 --> 03:55:16,980
Have a wonderful week.

4581
03:55:17,500 --> 03:55:20,620
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
