00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, December 9th, 2012, the Wii U is set to get a Google App, Nintendo blocks mature content during the day in one region, and could Idolmaster finally see a localized release?

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 485 of our show for this December 9th, 2012.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and gaming lulls with my co-hosts. Say hello first up to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Latke

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How are you doing?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Latke

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A lot of latkes

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, we still have some left. I can make more.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yum, yum, yum. DarkSakura was in the kitchen before the show tonight, and no, that's not a sexist joke. She was

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I volunteered

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, she was cooking up some latkes for the holiday season, because it is Hanukkah.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yup, it's the second night of Hanukkah.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Even though I am not Jewish myself, who am I to turn down food?

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Right, and I give everybody Hanukkah presents.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I say Mazel Tov! It was delicious.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I knew that Rob loves coffee, so I gave him and Allen a bunch of coffee.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Allen loves coffee too, that's important.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, I was like, what would they both like, so I got them crap tons of Keurig stuff.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good times.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I got, um, our other person in the room, um, gift cards.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Who I should introduce.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Including a Burger King gift card.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, and thank you for that.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're welcome.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm Jew by proxy, so.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, and I give everyone Hanukkah cards.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's true.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You, you, okay, DarkSakura converted to Judaism, you know.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Uh, Loki married a Jew. Well, I don't, what's my connection? I have friends that are Jewish.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The last girl I ever knew was Jewish.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You know John.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There you go, John. I lived with John.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's kind, he's not really Jewish.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I know he's not.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, that's why I call him kind of Jewie.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I actually, and I really, I really do mean it, you know, I like all sorts of people that I've met in my life.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And you like their food.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've met, like, I don't think I've ever met a Jewish person I didn't like really truly like.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Honestly, so.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, you know, we're also about to-

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now everybody's going to be like, oh, that's a challenge.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let me introduce you to the worst person I know.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You know what?

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We're now about two weeks away from the Alpacalypse.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, yes. The whole Mayan calendar.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, the Alpacalypse. When the wooly, long-necked creatures of the world will come and trample us all.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is that a Weird Al song?

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It should be.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Instead of-

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I thought that was his album, was Alpacalypse.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, yeah, but no, it was Alpocalypse.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But no, there's a thing like where they're showing pictures of Alpacas and they're saying so many days to the Alpacalypse.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've been laughing, so I want to have an Alpaca party.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You know, all I have to say is that how many times have they predicted the end of the world and it didn't happen?

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So this is just one more to put in there.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When NASA has to come out and say, stop being depressed, the world is not going to end.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your move next, world.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Anyhow, how are you, Techmaster Loki, in non-Armageddon news?

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Good.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've been constantly entering stuff on that steamgifts.com and obviously not winning anything.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wait, what is this?

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Steamgifts.com is basically a site you sign up for.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What happens is people give away steam codes on there.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So you enter raffles.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And so every time that someone puts a code up there, you get 5% of the points that that code's worth.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So each dollar, say it's a $5 code, it's, you know, 5 points.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You would get 1 point in your account.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, like, I went in there earlier and I had 180-some.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And so I kept, you know, enter to win, enter to win all these things.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And then you come back a few days later, oh, he got more points.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And so you just keep entering stuff in there and you can, you know, put your own stuff up there if you want.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And then that'll give you contributing dollars in which you can go to certain ones they have locked out.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, you have to have contributed $5 worth of steam codes to enter this drawing.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And it's a little easier to win because it's going to be more exclusive.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So you just do that.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But since it's free, I figured why not?

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And you might win something, or in this case, not.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You might win spam, email, filling your box.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We always have the ever-present fourth guest on our show at the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because we do tape live, as we have for the past, coming up on 11 years every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's vognetwork.com.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, each and every single Sunday night.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And actdeft in our chat room tonight says steamgifts.com, where nobody ever wins anything.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, somebody does. It's just, it's very rare.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But better chances in the lottery.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Actdeft does follow that up with, I only won one game in like a thousand entries.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, that was, that was one game.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Still better odds in the lottery.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Better than Loki's done out of that, apparently.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Haven't aired a thousand times yet, but.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Rob, I want to promote something.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What? Sure.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I told you about it earlier. My new Tumblr.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sure. Why not?

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Just because I want, I want people to give me suggestions.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My Tumblr is massaffecting.tumblr.com.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I'm doing this series called Lowell Effect, where I'm doing just all captions on Mass Effect screencaps.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I want people to participate.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you think of a good one, make it and send it to me, and I will post it.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you think maybe everybody's burned out on that by now?

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No. No. No.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Cause you talk about it every week.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Cause that's the, that's what I'm getting on Twitter right now.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is I need to shut up about the series.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because I'm ruining it by talking about it so much.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why not?

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Garris.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
All right.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Again, live.vognetwork.com.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What I wanted to talk about tonight was the VGAs.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Which, of course, happened on Friday night.

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And I don't think any of us watched.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, that's not true, Jamie.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You saw bits and pieces of it, it sounds like.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, I was, okay.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I saw this gifset go, I wasn't gonna watch it all.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And then I saw this gifset go up on my Tumblr feed.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That was all, like, broshep and femshep playing multiplayer with Garris.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I was like, okay, that's funny.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And so I found that the whole VGAs were streamed.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So I went looking through the stream to try to find it.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I ended up watching bits and pieces of it.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like, the Halo 4 thing was pretty funny.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And then I found the Mass Effect thing and I stopped caring about everything else.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I did watch the Claptrap one. It was pretty funny.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It was the little blips for, you know, best character of the year.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The Claptrap one was funny, I must admit.

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But, no.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Shepherd was robbed, both of them.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not gonna try to talk about or evaluate a show I didn't watch.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But just listening to Bobby, because he is before us, you know, every night, every Sunday night at VOG Network.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He was kind of talking about that it did seem like this year there was more stuff about the games.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There was less of the skits and kind of the, I guess for lack of a better term, dick and fart jokes.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And it did seem to be a little more about the games.

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And certainly it's interesting that Walking Dead won.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, you know, I'm not saying anything bad about the game.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I haven't played it, so I know no good or bad.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I know a lot of people really love it.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And it has nothing to do with the OMG Zombies part of it, but just I guess the storytelling in the game is so good.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And you had another game that was kind of similar in some ways, Journey.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Which is one of those kind of very difficult to explain to somebody why it's so good.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But it's that whole, like, emotional connection.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So it's like, and Journey probably won, what, the second most awards besides Walking Dead.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So Emotion really seemed to connect with the audience this year.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The big bro games, like, what would be the bro games?

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Halo 4, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, to some extent even Mass Effect, Jamie.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
None of those games really got the same type of recognition this year.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Best RPG, hello!

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That could be somewhat of a, I mean, I don't know, what does it mean?

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I mean, at the end of the day, what do the VGAs really mean anyway?

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But I guess you could say it is some of the critics and respected people in the industry coming together to make this decision.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So, you know, it's a little more than one site because it's kind of a collective.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Does the choice of the awards this year and the way it's all presented mean that they're taking this more seriously?

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Any thoughts? No?

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm yelling at Dan in chat room. Dan is in chat.

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I just think that they need to have Samuel Jackson hosted each year because he's pretty funny.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, they've been doing that.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, he's only hosted four times out of ten years, so, you know.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But it's like the last four years, hasn't it?

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In the best four years.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I did like him replacing Cortana and yelling at the people. I'm like,

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Cortana should have yelled at them. That was awesome.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And then I was like, oh, wait, Garrus.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Who ended up beating Jennifer Hale for the voice?

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know. I didn't care.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I know. It looked from, oh, somebody from Walking Dead.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Again, I can't evaluate a game I have not played, so I have nothing good nor bad, but I hear a lot of good things.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I will play it before the end of the year.

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mark Meer wasn't nominated, was he?

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He wasn't even nominated, no.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, because he wasn't all that great.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But...

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay, I will...

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He's fine.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You know what? He got better the more he did it.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Like practice.

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But Jennifer Hale...

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
She was dead on from the start.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's not even just femshep. I'm just talking about her as an actress and all the crap she's done.

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She's great.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And her Carol Danvers makes me a little, you know, warm.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There you go. Thank you.

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The chatters filling in the gap there.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It was Clementine from the Walking Dead, Melissa Hutchinson.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I understand...

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, she's not bad.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't even...

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Again, I haven't played the game, but I recognize that name as one that people talk a lot about on Twitter.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I can clearly see that, okay, you know.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And I say, you know what, Dark Sakura?

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let Clementine have her moment in the sun.

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mass Effect, they're on their third game.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And it's had its recognition in the past.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let Clementine have her moment.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I do have to say that I love that...

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And not just as a Garrus fangirl.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But I do like that Garrus was up there, you know, playing multiplayer with them during the little thing.

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, the little skit.

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It was hilarious.

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I was like, yeah.

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So...

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Alright.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If it had to be anybody, it must be Garrus.

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And just so you know, the best human male voice was Damian Clark from Borderlands 2 or Handsome Jack.

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's awesome.

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, that's the little bits and pieces I've heard.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Doesn't the male award seem to go to villains more often than heroes?

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh my god, Mark Hamill, thank you.

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Win the award for the Joker last year.

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Mark Hamill's awesome.

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But that was also the last time he's voicing the Joker ever.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Unless you give him more money.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I doubt it.

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, you think about people having to do a voice like that that's so different from their regular voice.

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's gonna actually take a physical toll on someone.

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They're gonna have to do another Arkham game at some point, though.

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So it'll be interesting to see how they frame it, you know?

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Alright.

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Anything else on the VGAs anyone wishes to comment on?

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You need to watch that clip, it was hilarious.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll take a look at some point.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Or Lands 2.

239
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And if anybody wants to see it, it's on my tumblr, mass effecting dot tumblr dot com.

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Plug, plug, cheap plug.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well no, the reason is because Viacom blocked it on YouTube.

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Gunstar in our chat room, who could that be?

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's Dan.

244
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No doubt commenting on the awards I was just talking about says,

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well put.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Although, my hubby is awesome because he said Garrus does sound like a boss though.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
His voice actor is kind of a goofy looking guy and if you ever watched the episode of Buffy he was in,

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
his awesome voice does not suit his face.

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It is kind of nice when your significant other will make a concession towards your fandom, isn't it?

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If he, you know.

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Has Nelly ever made any concessions towards your fandoms, Loki?

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, we had a discussion today about like,

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm like, so what exactly, you know, what do you think?

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm like, I don't know, garbage.

257
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's like, my point exactly.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And then in the case of Alan and I, we really do like a lot of the same stuff.

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean, he's way more into Half-Life than I am, but I don't like dislike it at all.

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
When I played it, it was, you know, the little bits I have played, I've enjoyed.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I just haven't sat down and played the whole thing, so we don't really have that same conflict.

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm sure there's something, there's something I'm not thinking of.

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's, you know what, my Rocky Horror thing and my cult movie thing,

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
he's been a good sport about coming out to see those and support that, so.

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's always nice when your significant other will buy into fandoms and so forth.

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Alright, I guess let's get into our gaming weeks

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and the types of games we have been playing this week.

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Raginator in chat says,

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are the odds of Mass Effect and Garrus winning every award if Dark Sakura hosted an award show?

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Shut up, don't judge me.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Don't judge me.

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This is why we don't host one.

273
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't judge me.

274
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We should do a fun year-end show again this year though, but anyway.

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Mass Effect all the things.

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
No, no.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And pumpkin.

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No. I don't even, will Mass Effect 3 win our game of the year? Question mark, question mark.

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It may not. I still have some games I need to play.

280
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Mass Effect all the things.

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, tell us about your gaming week as if I need to ask.

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I played Mass Effect 3.

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And Faerie Solitaire.

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
God, that game is awful. I love it.

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But for the past three weeks in a row, you've talked about your Faerie Solitaire.

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You keep saying it's awful, but it's clearly not.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's stupidly addicting. It's like playing on, remember back in the day when Neopets was big?

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now that was awful.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, but you remember the stupid card games on Neopets?

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah.

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And they were like kind of addicting?

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Is Neopets still around? They have to be still around.

293
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll check. I wonder if I still have my damn account.

294
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Didn't they sell Neopets shit at Claire's for some time?

295
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, they did.

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh my god. Did you ever walk into a Claire's just to buy Neopets stuff? Be honest.

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Someone that we both know has.

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Who hosts another show.

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, okay, okay. Interesting.

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm a witness to this.

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You know what? I can't judge. I can't judge.

302
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can judge.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
People have bought World of Warcraft cards. I can't judge.

304
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Someone bought a Mass Effect 2 deck of cards.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And, wow.

306
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You?

307
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes.

308
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And, wow. Lo and behold, the Joker card was Joker.

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Everybody has their thing.

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, I have not turned into a My Little Pony fan because there is nothing that is awesome as the old one.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The old one kicked ass. The new one is stupid.

312
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Alright, so.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm judging you all.

314
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Anything else for your week besides Mass Effect and Harry Solitaire?

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I watched Dan play, I'm sorry, Sega Racing Classic.

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And he put it in karaoke mode and started singing Let's Fry Sky High.

317
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I saw the pictures on his Facebook, and maybe I shouldn't be talking about your husband's Facebook on my radio show, but oops.

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Of somebody, either a friend of the family or somebody in your family, sitting in the little cart playing Daytona USA.

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What was that all about?

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sega. That was Dan's cousin's daughter.

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay. Well, I mean, you didn't have to tell me who. I'm just like, what was the whole?

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's Sophie. She's cute.

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What was the whole occasion?

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't know. I wasn't there.

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh.

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was hanging with Becky that night.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I assumed you were. My bad.

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I was out on a booze buying spree.

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Lots of Bailey's and Hypnotic and Kahlua and Sake.

330
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And then Becky dyed my hair, and then we made fun of people.

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It looked like a nice setup.

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Actually, Becky dyed my hair and played Mass Effect 2.

333
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Which Xbox Mass Effect 2.

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It is not that bad. Don't listen to her.

335
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's fine.

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The film grain is awful.

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's the problem.

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, but she turned it off and either, like, either her TV's contrast is up too high or the textures are just really bad.

339
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't listen to her. It's fine.

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
All right, Loki.

341
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Girl.

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Tell us about a different game.

343
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I played Far Cry 3 this week. Actually, a little bit more in the campaign.

344
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And it's fantastic.

345
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was hunting dingos last night.

346
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There will be no baby eating in my watch.

347
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And let's see. What else did I do?

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I played a bit of Minecraft this week.

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I've been working on getting the VoG network arena, the mob arena, done.

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And it is working right now.

351
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The classes are still kind of a work in progress.

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm still balancing things because it's fucking hard, okay?

353
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Even with just a few people, we've only managed to get to wave 20 out of 100.

354
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I had to scale down.

355
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The first boss is a chicken.

356
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's actually a pretty retarded chicken because it fires fireballs.

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But I'd say about 95% of the fireballs it actually fires hit itself.

358
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And so if you just, like, stand back for a while, it'll eventually kill itself.

359
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Which is kind of funny, but before it had way too much health.

360
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Because you can set the health to different levels.

361
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And I had it set to psycho health because it's a chicken, you know, whatever.

362
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It doesn't have a lot of health.

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't realize, though, the way it calculates it.

364
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's like the minimum health is like 100 or something.

365
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then it's, you know, time plus, you know, what was it?

366
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The number of players plus one times 40 for psychos.

367
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So this thing had like 16,000 hearts of health.

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So we were literally beating it with a stick for, I'd say, 20 minutes.

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And it still wasn't dead.

370
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And it was just like, okay, I think this is a little too powerful.

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So I had to tweak all that stuff.

372
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But we have a bunch of cool classes in there.

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
My friend wanted me to make a pimp class, so I made a pimp class.

374
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So you have a pimp stick that you can beat things with.

375
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You have your variety of hoes that you can use that have different abilities.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You know, because the game has hoes in it.

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And what else?

378
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There's a wolf master that you have wolves that attack things.

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I have a miner class.

380
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And there's a class that's, you know, like a golem class that you can build iron golems with.

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Although, no wait, I had that class, but then the iron golems did no damage to anything.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So I had to remove that.

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Ninjas, you know, lots of fun stuff.

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But it gets hard.

385
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean, it's just, it's insanely hard.

386
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But it's kind of fun.

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So I'm still balancing that stuff.

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Probably working on that a little bit this week.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But some good times, though, so far.

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And hitstunninchat at live.vognetwork.com wants to know,

391
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
are we getting world edit back?

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, sorry, I've been messing with the permissions stuff.

393
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah, you will have world edit back soon.

394
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
As soon as I fix that.

395
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Because I took everything out to figure out why the mob arena wasn't working.

396
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And in the process I kind of removed some of the permissions thing.

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I may put it back in the permissions bucket the way I had it before.

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Because B permissions is kind of weird.

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So I'll eventually fix that again.

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Alright.

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And then Call of Duty.

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Just Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2, a little bit of each.

403
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Mostly Modern Warfare 3.

404
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because we were supposed to be getting copies to do LAN stuff with.

405
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But those never came from Activision.

406
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And at this point I don't think they are coming.

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So I'm not buying copies for everybody.

408
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So fuck that.

409
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So I'll play it with my friend.

410
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And I think that's all I've played this week.

411
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Wait, no, there's one other thing.

412
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What the hell did I play this week?

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There's one other game I played.

414
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Nah, it's probably not important.

415
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
My gaming week, as I've talked about before on the show.

416
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I did pre-order the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation.

417
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And it came...

418
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Whatever. You'd buy it too if you...

419
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Actually, no. With the reasons that... I'll let you finish.

420
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Well, here's the thing.

421
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I got the game and it's fine.

422
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But it was a little... I'm doing my playthrough again.

423
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I haven't done a complete playthrough of the Mass Effect series.

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I know I've talked about the game a lot.

425
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And it's because I really enjoy the multiplayer.

426
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's kind of what's been keeping me afloat.

427
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is the first time I've really sat down to replay the entire series.

428
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So I'm doing it this time as Renegade.

429
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's the first time I did it at Paragon.

430
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And already I'm just seeing such differences in the story.

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But I'm playing through the first game.

432
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm playing it on PlayStation.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And if you guys didn't know, this is the first time

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the original Mass Effect has been on the PlayStation 3.

435
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
This is the first time. And what? The game's five years old.

436
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Because Microsoft had an exclusive on it for however many years.

437
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So they're just now bringing it out.

438
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So with all this time to release it and get it right,

439
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
you'd think it would be bug-free.

440
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But unfortunately that wasn't the case.

441
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I've been running into quite a few bugs that are not fun.

442
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Well, they're not game-breaking.

443
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I can't complain too much.

444
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But characters facing the wrong way in dialogue scenes.

445
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Just weird.

446
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Complete parts skipping.

447
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But when I load my game in place...

448
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So they're facing the wrong direction?

449
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I have to ask you a question!

450
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah, facing the complete wrong way.

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I only had one thing ever like that happen on the PC version

452
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
for Mass Effect 3.

453
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And that's when you're talking to Liara and Glyph is in the room.

454
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And if Shepard looks at Glyph,

455
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
then she doesn't look back at Liara at all.

456
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But that's only for that one conversation.

457
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Now, Shane's been telling me though that he's been playing the trilogy

458
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
because they got it too and that he's fine.

459
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They haven't seen any of the problems I've been complaining about.

460
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, I don't know.

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Maybe it's because I was downloading the Ni No Kuni demo

462
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
in the background while I was playing Mass Effect.

463
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So...

464
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Which, by the way, I didn't get to that demo yet.

465
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Sorry, don't ask me because I haven't played it yet.

466
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But yeah, I played a little bit of that.

467
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Besides the bugs, the game itself is still great,

468
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
but I would still say the best version is either going to be 360 or PC

469
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
depending on if you're a console or PC.

470
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Actually, for the first game, the PC is the superior version.

471
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It really is.

472
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Because they made the hacking thing is much better

473
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and just the Mako stuff is not as frustrating.

474
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
No, no, no. First game, all the Medi-Gel.

475
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Not the Medi-Gel, the Omni-Gel all the time.

476
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Or whatever that stuff was.

477
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's see, other games I've been playing.

478
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I got from my rental service, Silent Hill Book of Memories on the PSP.

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So, I was checking that out a little bit.

480
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I haven't really gotten much further than the original demo,

481
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
so I can't really say anything in addition to the demo I've already played.

482
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So...

483
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But I don't hate it.

484
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But it isn't really Silent Hill either.

485
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Somebody slapped Silent Hill on a dungeon crawler game.

486
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's what it is.

487
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, I was going to say, yeah. See, that was the thing.

488
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I was like, oh, maybe I'll try this and stuff.

489
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And then I looked at the back of the box and it had the screenshots.

490
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm like, what is a top-down third-person game?

491
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Nope.

492
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I like Alan's comment.

493
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Mass Effect 3 still has the exorcism neck bug, which is hilarious.

494
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Trainer gets it a lot.

495
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, it's like they're looking completely over their shoulder.

496
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I get it the most with Javik.

497
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Let me put it this way.

498
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When I played the series on 360, I don't remember ever seeing a bug

499
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
until the Omega DLC.

500
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Omega DLC was the first time I saw bugs in the 360 version.

501
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So just put it out there.

502
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh, by the way, just in case you're curious,

503
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 1 is based off the 360 version,

504
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
not the PC version.

505
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The hacking game is the whole button-pushing thing,

506
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:25,000
not the arrow through the circular lock thing that the PC has.

507
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So...

508
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Interesting.

509
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We've talked enough about that game here on this program,

510
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
so I'm just putting it out there,

511
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that I do have the trilogy on PlayStation,

512
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and it's just called Being a Fan and Buying All the Things.

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You know what?

514
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What?

515
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The problem is, okay, you know I started off playing it on 360

516
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and it hurt my hand.

517
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm not going to go get another version of a game I've already got on PC

518
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
when I love my PC version and I can make my Shepard blue.

519
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Just saying.

520
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I was curious about some of the differences,

521
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and especially multiplayer on 3, I wanted to have on the PlayStation controller.

522
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Research for the show, Rob.

523
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yes, research for the show.

524
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And it's not like I'm going to get a free copy, so might as well.

525
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Might as well.

526
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
All right, that's it for our gaming week.

527
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So we'll get into gaming news after I mention housekeeping,

528
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
twitter.com slash o-l-r, and of course our Facebook,

529
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

530
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And Dark Soccer's yelling from the kitchen,

531
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'll have to make another pector and break.

532
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I grabbed one earlier.

533
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They're so good.

534
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
They're not good for you.

535
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Why do we keep eating them?

536
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Potatoes and potassium.

537
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Then Alan's going to get home and be like,

538
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
you spoiled dinner.

539
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm going to make him a whole big thing of them, okay?

540
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
All right.

541
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

542
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Loki.

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
All right, so there is another game that's receiving a nomination for Grammy.

544
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That wonderful game would be Journey.

545
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And the soundtrack of the game is, I guess,

546
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
nominated for best score soundtrack for visual media.

547
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And I guess the nominees so far, Journey,

548
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The Adventures of Tin Tin, The Artist,

549
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Dark Knight Rises, and let's see,

550
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.

551
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So that would be pretty cool if it won.

552
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I mean, the soundtrack in the game was pretty awesome.

553
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And you may remember, of course, Civ IV won that award, I guess,

554
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
was that last year?

555
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah, it was last year.

556
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists.

557
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That was an interesting scenario.

558
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I mean, that song's great.

559
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Love Baba Yetu.

560
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean, who doesn't?

561
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And that's not just my Civ IV fandom coming into play.

562
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I really do love that song.

563
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But that was a weird situation because even though, yes,

564
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
it was the song from the video game,

565
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
it wasn't until he put it on his album,

566
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because he had that whole album that he did,

567
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and then that was nominated for the award from the album.

568
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So that's why Civ IV came out in, what, 2008, question mark?

569
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
No, earlier than that.

570
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
God, Civ IV was probably like 06 or 07.

571
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
10 was Civ IV, the console version, so I don't know.

572
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, no, it was a ways before that.

573
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I want to say Civ IV was what they were pimping at my first or second E3.

574
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So it was a while ago that Civ IV came out.

575
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And, yeah, so it took a little while.

576
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I'm not belittling that achievement by any means.

577
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That's an amazing thing, the amazing piece of work by Christopher Ten,

578
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and so happy that he got acknowledged for that.

579
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But this is interesting because now this is music that was made for the game,

580
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
released on the game soundtrack,

581
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
an entire body of work dedicated to the game getting nominated for the Grammy.

582
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And certainly that's, you know, it's like we dipped our toe in with Baba Yetu,

583
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and now we're starting to put the whole foot in by nominating a game soundtrack.

584
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And in reality, this is almost as good as it gets.

585
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I mean, video game soundtrack songs are not going to really get nominated

586
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
for song of the year unless you have something on the caliber of the Titanic song,

587
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
was the only, like, the last soundtrack song I can think of that got nominated

588
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
for a song of the year Grammy.

589
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So, I mean, we're long, long away from that.

590
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But being up there with all those films, that's an awesome achievement.

591
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So now the question, is he going to win?

592
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't know.

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I know. It's hard to say. We're not really in the music industry,

594
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
so certainly it's got to be getting him a little more exposure, though,

595
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
than the competition.

596
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But at the same time, the artist won the Grammy, didn't it?

597
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Or the artist, excuse me, the artist won the Oscar, didn't it?

598
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So it's, you know.

599
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't know.

600
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I don't know if that really ties in.

601
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Just because it won the Oscar doesn't mean, you know, I'm going to win for music.

602
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's very true. You never know what will happen.

603
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's a different body of voters, and you never know.

604
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There might be some people like us that kind of look at it and go,

605
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
yeah, video games should be getting more recognition,

606
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
or there'll be people that react quite the opposite.

607
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It just really depends on who's voting on those.

608
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So, Black Wolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

609
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
it won't win.

610
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's flat out, it won't win.

611
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But this is what we wanted.

612
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't know if not winning is what we wanted,

613
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
but yes, I don't think that's what he's trying to say.

614
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I think he's trying to say the acknowledgement next to the film scores

615
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
is what we wanted.

616
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And yes, I think to some extent that is what we want.

617
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Could they possibly have a separate category for game soundtracks someday?

618
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Could they be getting confused with Journey the game and Journey the band?

619
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Dude, I love Journey.

620
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
They should totally get nominated for best soundtrack score.

621
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Probably not.

622
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't think Journey's been nominated for a Grammy since 82.

623
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That's why they need to score the next Tron movie.

624
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
All right.

625
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
All right, let's move on with some more news.

626
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Don't stop light speeding.

627
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This one's about a comment from Gabe Newell on living room PCs,

628
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
which I want to preface this story.

629
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You were showing me before the show, Loki, this big screen mode in Steam,

630
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
which I got to be honest, I haven't played a lot with,

631
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
but you were showing it to me.

632
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And in a nutshell, it does turn your Steam environment

633
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
into a Xbox-style UI that takes up your full monitor space.

634
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It doesn't look like Windows anymore.

635
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It looks nice, I think.

636
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, I like the ability that it basically,

637
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
since it is catered towards using a joystick, which is fine,

638
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that you can sort your games based on joystick support,

639
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
whether the games have it or not, which is kind of cool.

640
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The thing I wish they would add,

641
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and maybe this is something that they can add later on,

642
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
is those games that do not support joysticks,

643
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
maybe have it where you can have some sort of in-Steam client app

644
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
or something like that, where you can set up almost like an X-PAD-er type thing,

645
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
where you can assign keys to the joystick buttons,

646
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and then that way you can have a profile for each thing.

647
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Because a lot of these games, and actually it's funny,

648
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
because Arma 2 is one that supports the joystick,

649
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and I thought that was one that didn't support the Xbox game pad.

650
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I was like, huh, that already does, so sweet.

651
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And it's not like a wireless keyboard to use as a controller

652
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
for a game console is unheard of.

653
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I mean, Final Fantasy XI?

654
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah. But see, the thing is, as I was looking at it,

655
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm like, you know, that would not be that...

656
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It wouldn't be that weird to actually...

657
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You know, this whole...

658
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Everyone's kind of talking about Doom and Gloom

659
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
with the next console cycle and stuff.

660
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Not that it's ever gonna happen, but if it went the way where,

661
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
oh, we're gonna lock all this stuff down,

662
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you're not gonna be able to sell used games and stuff like that,

663
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
would playing on PC be that bad?

664
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
No, I don't think it would be that bad, actually.

665
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
If it's all going through Steam,

666
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
it seems very convenient for me.

667
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And honestly, the vast majority of the games I have on Steam

668
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I have not played yet.

669
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And it just keeps adding to the list, but I keep getting things for it.

670
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But I have quite a collection that it would be kind of cool to have

671
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
a gaming PC hooked up to my TV to play stuff like that.

672
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well, that is where Gabe Newell thinks things are going,

673
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
meaning that those types of living room PCs

674
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
are going to be big competition for the next-gen gaming cycle.

675
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
This is in an interview with Kotaku at the VGAs,

676
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
because, you know, Gary Newell was there.

677
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Was that what she called him? Gary Newell? Something like that.

678
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Kind of messed up. There's a clip somewhere,

679
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
one of the interviewees called him the wrong name.

680
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You're Gabe from Penny Arcade, right?

681
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Gabe Do-Well.

682
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
She apologized for it.

683
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Cousin of Dudley Do-Right.

684
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
She apologized for it on Twitter.

685
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And I gotta say, you know, live TV sucks sometimes, especially, you know.

686
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It can be a lot of pressure, so I shouldn't give her too hard of a time,

687
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
but obviously she's going to get yelled at for that mistake.

688
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But anyway, Gabe Newell doing his thing on the red carpet at the VGAs,

689
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
talking to Kotaku, talking about that the big picture interface

690
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
ended up being stronger than expected.

691
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Next, they want Steam Linux out of beta.

692
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
They want big picture on that operating system.

693
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
This gives Valve flexibility in developing their own hardware.

694
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That's true.

695
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
He says he expects companies to start selling PC packages for living rooms next year.

696
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
They already are. I mean, look at Alienware.

697
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I mean, it's vastly expensive, but you-

698
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Look at Ouya.

699
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Ouya is a bare-ass bones type of living room PC.

700
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
But it's that same setup as you would see with big picture mode.

701
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
In fact, the interface looks kind of similar,

702
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
although I do like big picture a little bit.

703
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But from what I've seen, we obviously don't know what the Ouya looks like,

704
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
although we're not that far away.

705
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I mean, and that Ouya thing, man, is smaller than this box right here,

706
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
my four-pack of Red Bulls.

707
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Gabe Newell said in the interview,

708
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
quote, I think in general that most customers and most developers

709
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
are going to find that the PC is a better environment for them

710
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
because they won't have to split the world into thinking about,

711
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
why are my friends in the living room,

712
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
why are my video sources in the living room different from everyone else?

713
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So in a sense, we hopefully are going to unify those environments.

714
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Hmm.

715
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't know.

716
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The unification thing is interesting.

717
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I think in a way that's what the consoles kind of want to be,

718
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
that all-in-one device, and you do see that, like,

719
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
360 tries to talk to Windows Media and all that sharing.

720
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And even the PlayStation 3, you can kind of stream things off your PC and so forth.

721
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It's not exactly intuitive on either one how to do it.

722
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I think if a lot of that was built a little more into the interfaces,

723
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
you'd see a lot more of that.

724
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I think they make it too many clicks to get to a lot of that stuff within the consoles.

725
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I think it's interesting.

726
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I think it definitely lends something to the fact of,

727
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
if they sold a little gaming PC in a box that looked like a console,

728
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
hooked up to your TV like a console, ran like a console,

729
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
why would I need a console?

730
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Price point, because I think console prices,

731
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
it's going to be hard to build a gaming PC for $400

732
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
that can run all of these games and look nice.

733
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I mean, granted, you can build a $400 gaming PC,

734
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
but it's not going to run a lot of these games in higher ultra and stuff.

735
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And if you're streaming to your TV via HDMI,

736
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I mean, you're talking like a really large resolution,

737
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I mean, 1080p.

738
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So it's going to be a little hard to make them look that nice

739
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and run on that big of a resolution.

740
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's the only thing.

741
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That's why consoles kind of,

742
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I mean, granted, a lot of the games get stripped down a bit,

743
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
but that's the thing with PCs and like hell,

744
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I spent $1,700 on my PC a few years ago,

745
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and it was just like this high-end thing.

746
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It ran Crysis pretty awesome.

747
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And then now it's just junk.

748
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It's just like I can't even upgrade it without replacing everything.

749
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
There's nothing I can salvage from it except for the case,

750
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
maybe the heat sinks, but everything else is just, it's so old.

751
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Well, I find the part where he talks about how Linux,

752
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
the steam on Linux has to get better

753
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
so that they can kind of develop a box that supports Linux and so forth.

754
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That strikes me as interesting

755
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
because why do video game consoles usually work the way they do?

756
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Because they're dedicated gaming consoles.

757
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
They don't have all this excess fat for all the other things that a PC does.

758
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But the interesting thing about Linux is that, as I understand it,

759
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
part of the reason people are such fans of Linux

760
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
is that it's a lean operating system,

761
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and it doesn't have all the fat that Windows has with it.

762
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That's what I'm running on my netbook.

763
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Would that be a fair statement about Linux?

764
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'd say so.

765
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You've got the control that Windows lacks.

766
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So they want to use a better operating system, essentially,

767
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
to do a dedicated thing, which makes sense,

768
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
but could it be as powerful as a dedicated gaming console?

769
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't know. You make a good point.

770
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Do you expect that a little set-top box is going to do this 1080p?

771
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It probably won't.

772
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Granted, a lot of the games on Steam, aside from the big console,

773
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the big triple-A games, like the indie games,

774
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
a lot of the indie games don't require a lot of processing power,

775
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I think, that you would need on some of these higher-end games.

776
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But there are those higher-end games that they're also on Steam,

777
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and a lot of those are the ones that support the controllers.

778
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So it's going to be hard.

779
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Granted, a lot of this stuff is going to come down in cost,

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and you could probably build something a little bit cheaper,

781
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
but I think it's going to be difficult for them to come up with something

782
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
that you can fit in a box small enough.

783
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I mean, because you also have to worry about heat and everything,

784
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
fitting it into a console-sized box.

785
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It's going to be a lot of engineering to get it right.

786
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Akuma JP in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

787
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What's wrong with being a chubby?

788
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
There is nothing wrong with being a little fluffy.

789
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You'll notice in that whole thing I just talked about,

790
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I didn't say I was going to throw out my Windows PC.

791
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
No, I mean, there's still things that I'll want one of those for.

792
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Well, I just want to take a quick look real quick.

793
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The Alienware one, remember, they have their console thing?

794
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I was just, you know, an idea.

795
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So it's the X51 mini gaming desktop,

796
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and the base price, because it's from Dell,

797
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
the base price you can pay for that is $699.

798
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So $700 for this.

799
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
$699 U.S., $699 U.S.

800
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And here's what you get for $699.

801
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's a Core i3, which, I mean, that's not going to run some high-end stuff there.

802
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You get 6GB of RAM, you know, a 1TB hard drive,

803
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Geforce 640 GT, which is a pretty good graphics card.

804
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's not the top, top, top of the line.

805
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But, you know, the Core i3 is really going to hurt it, I think.

806
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't know, it just seems quite expensive to build something with that form factor.

807
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Obviously, you don't need to pay Alienware to do it.

808
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You can build your own smaller PCs for probably a lot cheaper than that.

809
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You know what computer I'm hooking up to my TV as soon as I can?

810
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
A Commodore 64. And I gotta say, tangent time,

811
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
to Alan's credit, he told me that he was trying to get me a Commodore 64 for Christmas,

812
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but it's probably not going to come through.

813
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Because he tried to do an eBay auction, and it's outside of his price range or whatever.

814
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But I was like, damn, that would have been awesome!

815
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Dude, you just need to go down to the Danaios or something like that.

816
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I don't think I don't look every time I go to see if one's up there.

817
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You have to make sure it works.

818
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I actually do go by the thrift stores and keep an eye open, too.

819
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Well, my parents supposedly still have our old one, and my dad's kept it all these years,

820
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and it might still work, so I said I want them to find it.

821
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't even know when I'm going to play on it, that's the thing.

822
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I just fucking want one, okay?

823
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
There's plenty of Commodore 64 games I could play.

824
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'll play Donkey Kong the way I remember it.

825
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I didn't go to the arcades or have Nintendo that age.

826
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I played Donkey Kong on Commodore 64.

827
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Cliquavision.

828
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
There you go.

829
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
There you go.

830
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Gunstar in chat says, the Commodore 64, it's really neato.

831
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?

832
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah, Weird Al.

833
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I did tell him, and this is advice for anybody that might be looking for this retro-tastic machine,

834
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
don't forget that there's also the Commodore 64C, which is totally fine.

835
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's smaller and has white keys.

836
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's like PS Mini and PS2 or whatever.

837
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Same type of thing.

838
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And then there was the Commodore 128, which had 64 mode.

839
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
128s are totally fine.

840
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Just throwing it out there.

841
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Everybody get robbed of a Commodore 64.

842
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Gunstar reminds us the C64 version of Donkey Kong was rad.

843
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It was because it had the Pie Factory level.

844
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yes.

845
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Which is really supposed to be a cement factory or something, but it's pies.

846
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It was the Pie Factory.

847
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I know what you mean.

848
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But I will say that looks-wise, the Cliquavision version was really good.

849
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
For a Cliquavision.

850
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Hey, the Cliquavision of Mouse Trap was the best one ever.

851
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Alright, moving on.

852
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Dark Sakura.

853
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
More news.

854
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Ugh, Rob.

855
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Less Cliquavision.

856
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Something more current.

857
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
How about Nintendo being butthead?

858
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So, you know what you can't do, at least according to Nintendo of Europe?

859
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You cannot access 18 related content at certain times of the day.

860
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
In fact, you get a little message that says,

861
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You can't do this.

862
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Meh.

863
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It actually, one of the NeoGaf users actually had the issue and contacted

864
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Nintendo of Italy's customer support and got this message.

865
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Dear customer, we would like to let you know that Nintendo has always aimed

866
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to offer gameplay experiences suited to all age groups.

867
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Observing carefully the relevant regulations regarding content

868
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
access that are present in the various European countries.

869
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We have thus decided to restrict the access to content which is unsuitable

870
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
to minors, Peggy, to the 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. time window.

871
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I feel like in that same voice you should be saying,

872
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
For English, press one.

873
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Para español, marque numero dos.

874
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That was your very polite little operator noise there.

875
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Except this is like Nintendo of Europe, so maybe I should have affected

876
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
a really bad British accent.

877
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Dear customer, we would like to thank you that...

878
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
No. Sorry.

879
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Now that makes me think of that South Park episode with the Worcestershire sauce.

880
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You know when I called it water shower sauce?

881
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So, it's like, you've got to be up all night to download anything.

882
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Meh.

883
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's like, ugh, whatever Nintendo.

884
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't know if they've done this crap here though.

885
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Have they?

886
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
No. Yeah.

887
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So, I guess Nintendo really doesn't like Europe.

888
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Unless they want to give them RPGs that we want.

889
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't think it's because Nintendo doesn't like Europe, Jamie.

890
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think it's some type of...

891
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
They don't like Italy.

892
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
My gut would say it's a law thing, but I'm like, I don't think there is a law.

893
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Is it a culture thing?

894
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's a cover your ass type of thing, which is all Nintendo ever does.

895
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You know, and I think they would have tried to do it here too,

896
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
except I think Reggie probably put his foot down or shoved up someone's ass

897
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and said no.

898
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's weird because I want to come out and say this isn't bad.

899
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Hold on, I'm doing a search.

900
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But it is bad because I should be able to get what I want.

901
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's not bad if it only comes on when you have parental controls on.

902
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Then that's a great idea.

903
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This would be a great idea for parental controls.

904
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Although, honestly, why would you want your kids using the shop unattended anyway?

905
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, they can let kids drink wine, but they can't see boobs or blood.

906
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But you don't have boobs in video game.

907
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
In fact, in Europe's culture, boobs are a little less...

908
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah, because America is freaking backwards.

909
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Well, exactly.

910
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So violence is much more of a thing over there.

911
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So maybe that's the difference because we're so desensitized

912
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
through a lot of the movies like Saw and all that shit,

913
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
which is taboo over there.

914
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Maybe that's the difference.

915
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You know what? I think everyone needs to get over it.

916
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Well, here's my thing.

917
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I wonder if this was kind of a shock for the third parties that are involved in this

918
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
because if you think about it, why am I going to put my game on your marketplace

919
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
if you're going to limit the sale to only four hours out of a 24-hour day?

920
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Brilliant question.

921
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
SSJ 100, Matt.

922
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
In all reality, yes.

923
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I would love to know what the third parties have to say about it.

924
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Who, by the way, sent me a Hanukkah card. SSJ 100, Matt.

925
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
My first one of the year.

926
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Oh, go ahead. Sorry.

927
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I was going to say, he actually says parental controls are hard for parents,

928
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
especially stupid ones.

929
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
But, I mean, they shouldn't...

930
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They have this stuff in place.

931
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
They don't need to do this time thing as well.

932
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And that doesn't stop anybody.

933
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That's about as effective as an age gate, okay?

934
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
On a video. That's all it is.

935
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh, I can't...

936
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You know, a person that knows about Assassin's Creed 3...

937
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
First off, you'd have to be...

938
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
No offense, but I think you're going to have to be a complete idiot

939
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
to go download this game to your console instead of going to buy it retail.

940
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't know why you'd do that unless, I guess, you're under the age or something like that.

941
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And your parents really don't want to buy it for you.

942
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Although, in which case, I say go to eBay.

943
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So, I don't understand why you would want to download it to your console in the first place.

944
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And then, on top of that...

945
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I mean, fuck.

946
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
This person that knows about, you know, these games

947
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
is probably most likely going to be able to read most of the blogs out there on the internet

948
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and go, hey, well, all I do is download this at 11 p.m.

949
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And they download it at 11 p.m.

950
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Kids shouldn't be using this parent's credit card on the store at any hour of the day.

951
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And you know whose problem that is?

952
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Their parents.

953
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And that's whose problem it should always be.

954
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Their parents.

955
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I mean, here's the thing. They may not be using their card.

956
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
They may be buying, you know, a prepaid card at a store, you know, and putting it in that way.

957
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
All right.

958
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So, there's ways around everything.

959
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But once again, there's ways around everything.

960
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So, why limit it?

961
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Okay, and I know the comment about parental controls being hard earlier was said in jest or a joke or whatever.

962
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But seriously, when you first turn on the Wii U, the first time you're going through the initial setup,

963
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
there is a question.

964
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Do you wish to enable parental controls? Yes or no?

965
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So, all the parent has to do is be there when their $400 machine is turned on for the first time.

966
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And I'm pretty sure if this is like any other Nintendo console or device that comes with it.

967
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
$300, excuse me.

968
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Like, four, like, thick fucking manuals that probably tell you how to set up, you know, parental controls if you really wanted to.

969
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And if your kids aren't getting some sort of prepaid card, where the fuck are they getting the money to buy this?

970
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Let's just say it's maybe like, I don't know, it's just stupid.

971
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's basically saying, oh, well, you know, we made this hardcore console that's really only available for, you know, children is what we've marketed this console to.

972
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I mean, they're like, oh, yeah, we want this console for the grownups.

973
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
This is going to have hardcore games.

974
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh, but sorry, you're not going to be able to play those hardcore games because this console is really just for children.

975
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Breakman in our chat says censorship is a fucking bitch-ass whore slut.

976
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You know what it is?

977
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Correct.

978
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's just that these violent game trailers and games on the internet are very disturbing to elderly people who, thankfully, do not stay up past 11.

979
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Although...

980
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
If they all just magically fall asleep right before 11.

981
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Although, that's why, that's why, though, that it only goes till 3.

982
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because a lot of them do wake up quite early in the morning, so it's that 11 to 3 period that most elderly people are asleep.

983
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That's why they're hiding this.

984
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It's not because of the kids.

985
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's the elderly people.

986
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
VX JasonXV in chat wants to throw out a theory, and it's a good one, so let me throw it out there.

987
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Nintendo is classified as a media service.

988
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
TV.

989
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And now they have TV with VII.

990
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
TV.

991
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And now they have to abide by TV laws, which restricts content into those hours in some countries.

992
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Not a bad thought.

993
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Is this because Nintendo is not treating itself as a game device anymore?

994
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Because remember, they make their own fucking rules.

995
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It's not an X-Gen system, it's a Nintendo-Gen system.

996
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And this is now a television.

997
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't think so, because look at the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

998
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'd say they have as many, if not more, streaming content on there than Nintendo.

999
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's just, why would you restrict the rules, you know, to one console and not the others?

1000
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I just, I think this is just something Nintendo is doing on their own.

1001
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I don't think this is anything that they're forcing them to do, because why aren't they forcing the other guys to do the same thing?

1002
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's the Nintendo ass hattery, it's what they do.

1003
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't know if it's ass hattery, but it's very throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which we've seen Nintendo do so many times before, like friend codes.

1004
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Friend codes was set up to protect, you know, kids, and we all had to suffer for it.

1005
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It's the same dumb decision that screwed that up that's screwing this up.

1006
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Thank God it didn't happen here.

1007
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Although at the same time, do you really need to download ZombiU online, like just go to the store and buy it or get it on Amazon?

1008
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Seriously, just wait, or yeah, I mean Amazon, there's a perfect way, I mean you can do that.

1009
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,000
A lot of, I just, I don't know, I don't think, what would be the point of downloading this stuff to your console?

1010
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I just, I don't know, for that type of stuff, unless you're like, you know, Steam, I understand, because a lot of times I buy stuff on sale,

1011
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
and so, okay, that makes sense, I want to download this, and it's only available digitally, because a lot of PC games aren't available at the market.

1012
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But, a console game, I just don't see why I would need to, unless I'm getting some really great discount on it, why I would...

1013
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'll throw this out there, for what it's worth, you don't have to pay tax on them right now.

1014
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I mean, technically you do, you have to report that to the state and your taxes at the end of the year, but let's be real, who's doing that?

1015
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So, you get them tax free.

1016
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That's not that much of a savings.

1017
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And you get the 10% kickback from Nintendo if you have a Wii Deluxe, or Wii U Deluxe, which most people probably do, that have the Wii U right now.

1018
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I just, I don't think that would be much of a motivator for me.

1019
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Just saying, that is something.

1020
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And you get it right now, well, an hour from now when it finishes downloading.

1021
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm probably more than that.

1022
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Faster than Amazon.

1023
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

1024
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Alright, so the Wii U has sold 425,000 units in the U.S. after being out there for a week.

1025
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So, compare that to some of the other systems, I believe, the Xbox 360 and PS3, and the original...

1026
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Well, the original Wii, I want to say, sold only 300,000 units during that same time period.

1027
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
The original Wii, I think they say in that same article, is 475.

1028
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
475?

1029
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Well, yeah, it sold 475 in its first week, but I'm talking about actually now.

1030
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Like, I think it sold only, I think it was 300,000 units or something like that.

1031
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It was still pretty high.

1032
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And of course, the Xbox 360, I think it was three quarters of a million, and I want to say the PS3 was like five or something like that.

1033
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So, I guess that's pretty good.

1034
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Here's my thing, though.

1035
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And this is unlike, you know, the Wii.

1036
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So, you remember with the Wii, the whole reason was shortages on this stuff.

1037
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Last I checked, I went to the store, like, I went to Walmart one day, and I was like,

1038
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
you know what, I'm just gonna go walk down Electronics Island, see what they've got as far,

1039
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
let's see if they have any Wii U's, just see if they've finally gotten stock.

1040
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And there was a stack of ten Wii U's.

1041
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
No, it wasn't like, oh, people are clamoring to get this stuff.

1042
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It was just sitting there, no one gave a shit.

1043
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And same with, like, you go on, like, GameStop, and you can do a search of their inventories and stuff like that.

1044
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And I'd say about the majority, well, all of them had some stock on them, and some of them had quite a bit of stock on them.

1045
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So, I know that they were doing more to replenish them, but I'm thinking that the demand on this isn't as high as they had hoped.

1046
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I mean, yeah, $425,000 sounds awesome, but is that gonna dip off really fast, because they're just sitting there now?

1047
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I don't know. I don't know. I think it's still too soon to tell.

1048
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I think we need to see what the entire holiday season looks like, and we need to see what the Fury looks like after the holidays.

1049
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Like, was it just a holiday thing, or is it still in demand in January and February?

1050
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
But you know what it's gonna take to keep that demand going? Games!

1051
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And we've got... Pikmin?

1052
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
In March.

1053
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Wii U games? Let me refresh my memory right here.

1054
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Wii U games, we've got, um...

1055
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
30 Great Games? What's that game with the bear?

1056
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Family Party, 30 Great Games, Arcade, or Obstacle Arcade.

1057
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Tell me you've seen the Miiverse stuff for the 30 Great Games stuff.

1058
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh my god. Miiverse is becoming more and more like one of the most genius things to happen in gaming ever.

1059
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And I'm not giving Nintendo all that credit. It's an idiot savant type of genius.

1060
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It's unintended genius.

1061
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Where, like, Miiverse is amazing.

1062
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Have you seen the stuff on Miiverse for some of these, like, shovelware games that show up?

1063
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Alright, I gotta get the Wii U. You've gotta see this.

1064
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Loki, you'll laugh your ass off at some of the stuff that people are posting in Miiverse on these games.

1065
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But anyway.

1066
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But I was gonna see, like, right now I'm looking just to see what's in this area.

1067
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
You know, as far as, like, availability.

1068
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And let's see here. The first one, low stock, in stock, in stock, in stock, low stock, in stock, in stock, in stock.

1069
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And that's the, you know, first eight stores that they have there.

1070
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
In stock, in stock, in stock, low stock, in stock, low stock, low stock.

1071
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
So, it looks like, you know, within, you know, 20 miles of us, they are stocked at every single GameStop.

1072
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And I think that's the same thing, you know, happening at, you know, Walmarts, Targets, probably everywhere.

1073
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So, that begs the question, I mean, I understand this may be a hot holiday item.

1074
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But, I don't think it's as, I don't think it's as in demand as they want it, they want everyone to believe it is.

1075
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And don't get me wrong, they have some pretty good games at launch, but they don't really have anything coming out.

1076
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Like, the first Wii U game I can think of is in March.

1077
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Rayman Legends is the, not March, February 26th is Rayman Legends, is the first big game to come out next.

1078
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Cool, that's like a whole month and a half, almost two and a half months of nothing for the Wii U.

1079
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I mean, that's kind of bad. That's not a good, you know, that's quite a drought of games.

1080
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Okay, I'm going to give this to you while I read the next story. I'm just going to give this to you.

1081
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Just scroll through and look at some of the posts on this game. Use the joystick on the left.

1082
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You can just scroll going up and down, because there's some funny shit on there.

1083
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Alright, moving on to the next story, which is about other things coming to the Wii U that I could hand the tablet to Loki during the show and have him take a look at.

1084
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Wii U Panorama View is coming in the spring.

1085
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:48,000
This is something that will let you view panoramic videos on your gamepad by actually moving the device around so you don't necessarily use the joysticks to spin around.

1086
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You can actually pick up the device and move it around like one of those early Wii U demos.

1087
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That will be in the spring for both North America and Europe. That will be an eShop release.

1088
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
There is a free preview demo that will be going on the eShop that will have some scenes that will come in advance of the actual release.

1089
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Now, I have no idea how these pictures are taken or where they come from. I'm assuming there's a particular format standard out there, because I know I've seen panoramic pictures online before.

1090
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Interesting. I don't know if it's particularly useful, but okay. Google Maps.

1091
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
What's on his head?

1092
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh, that was from Nintendo Direct.

1093
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So basically it's just your average forum with all sorts of memes in here.

1094
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:42,000
But that is Nintendo moderated and endorsed on the console. If you press pause and hit Miiverse, that is what you'll see.

1095
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yeah, that's cool that they're only removing offensive stuff, but not a lot of memes are offensive.

1096
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Do you see a lot of the stuff with the jokes about shovels?

1097
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah, I understand the Nintendo seal of crap. I understand that, but I hardly call this genius. I just call this your standard forum.

1098
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Are you not entertained?

1099
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:14,000
No, I'm not entertained. I mean, I just don't know.

1100
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
This is just in everybody. Loki is not amused.

1101
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I mean, they have Barry Potter and Batman that says, I have no family. I don't know. I don't think this is that great.

1102
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Maybe it was better the first couple days. Some of it's wearing off.

1103
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Alright, look. Moving on.

1104
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It's kind of funny, I guess.

1105
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Anyhow, PanoramaView was originally unveiled at E3, but they announced that it is coming in the spring, obviously.

1106
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Also coming, Google Maps for Wii U. The Street View functionality with Google Maps will work with the gamepad just like PanoramaView.

1107
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Because those Google cars take the panorama screenshots all the time.

1108
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,000
That app will be in the eShop in late January. It will be free until the end of March.

1109
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Google Maps will be coming to the U.S. eShop in the first quarter.

1110
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So notice how it's not going to be forever that that thing is going to be free.

1111
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But I think that's kind of cool that Google Maps is coming. I mean, I don't know the particular usefulness of it.

1112
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I better buy a Wii U so I can get Google Maps.

1113
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
What's with the flying penis rocket ship?

1114
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,000
That's Miiverse. Somebody tried to get away with drawing a penis on Miiverse and they drew it as a rocket ship.

1115
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Hey, this isn't uncomfortable.

1116
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah, I thought you played with the Wii U thing before.

1117
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Not with your little thing here. I'm not going to say anything about your little thing.

1118
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Let's move on. Dark Soccer, it's actually your turn. You'll have to put the tablet down for a minute.

1119
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Take your evil away from me, Rob.

1120
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So, next, people have been going off about this.

1121
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And, you know what? I was going to be super skeptical of it until I actually did look at the logo.

1122
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Needless to say, I'm talking about the Phantom Pain, which basically is a trailer of a guy that they had at the VGAs.

1123
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,000
The guy has a hook arm and he's like, you're just waking up, and then a hundred feet soldier. We're getting killed out here.

1124
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And if you look at the guy walking around, he's got a gray mullet and a shaggy beard when you can sort of see his face, but most of his face is covered up in bandages.

1125
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And he's missing a hand, he's got a hook arm, and it's being put out by this Moby Dick Studios.

1126
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Which, I mean, I can't really think of anything how Moby Dick itself, you know, could be an illusion towards it.

1127
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Because, I mean, it's just a big revenge story, so maybe there's some revenge subplot? I don't know.

1128
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:19,000
But the company is supposed to be some Swedish company, and the CEO is Joakim Mogren, but the J-O-A-K-I-M is an anagram for Kojima.

1129
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
People are thinking this is actually a trailer for Metal Gear Solid 5.

1130
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Now, as I posted much earlier in the chat room, is that if you look at the logo, there are little chunks missing out of the text.

1131
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And if you use the same typeface and align it to these little markings that are coming out of the text, it perfectly fits the shape of Metal Gear Solid 5.

1132
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And I will relink the photo in the chat room for those who are curious.

1133
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:01,000
But, I mean, and I mean, I'm even looking, it has to be, of course, in the same typeface, but it is a perfect match.

1134
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's sort of like they posted it there and then used the Pathfinder tool in InDesign or something, for anyone who knows what that is.

1135
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:21,000
But, um, I guess I see it now. I didn't see it at first until I looked at the logo.

1136
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It makes sense that, you know, it's time for another Metal Gear Solid. I know they always say the other one's gonna be the last one, but come on.

1137
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
They'll take that until it stops making money.

1138
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I don't know. I don't know if it's Metal Gear Solid. I think it's New Bionic Commando.

1139
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And, spoiler!

1140
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
What?

1141
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
His wife is his claw.

1142
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
No.

1143
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Spoiler!

1144
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Just look at the picture that I linked in the chat room, guys.

1145
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
That was the plotline in the first Bionic Commando game that they made for you.

1146
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
How does that work? The more time on spoilers is up on the game. I'm never gonna play that game. I wanna know.

1147
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
How does that work? How is his wife the claw?

1148
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
She's the AI that's in there. Like, it's her AI. Or her.

1149
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So she's GLaDOS.

1150
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You can marry-

1151
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah, it's like GLaDOS.

1152
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You can marry AI.

1153
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
No, the AI can be turned-

1154
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Well, they dumped her personality in there.

1155
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
The Supreme Court is gonna decide next year if I get to get married or not, but you can marry your AI.

1156
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
To quote Rob, put her in a CD. I don't care.

1157
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
They had all those tubes, and they're like, we need to fill the tubes with something.

1158
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So they just threw his wife in a wood chipper, shoved her in the tubes for the Bionic Commando.

1159
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I mean, that's-

1160
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You shouldn't put your wife in a wood chipper. That's wrong.

1161
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
She'll say she can't, but put her in there anyway.

1162
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Well, he didn't put her in a- I don't know.

1163
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Why would you put your wife in a wood chipper? That's really rude.

1164
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Maybe he's just really into self-gratification, and so, you know, he thought his wife is the claw.

1165
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That's wrong.

1166
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Men.

1167
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Because the claw touches him in ways that-

1168
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
The claw.

1169
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
His hand can't.

1170
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
It decides who will go and who will stay. Ah.

1171
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Can we please, please get to release dates?

1172
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I guess.

1173
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Although I'm not expecting to hear an awful lot, but let's see. Release dates.

1174
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Alright, so this week we've got the game of the year, The Walking Dead.

1175
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
The whole, basically, season one on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1176
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
007 Legends on the Wii U.

1177
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I mean, that's pretty awesome, right? Cool.

1178
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U.

1179
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Wheel of Fortune on the Wii U, like with Vanna White and shit?

1180
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah. Awesome.

1181
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah, it's the game-

1182
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
60 bucks?

1183
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's the game that they, yeah, it's like 40, I think.

1184
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It's the game that they put out on the Wii and Xbox 360 earlier.

1185
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I like Wheel of Fortune. I'm real good at it.

1186
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Well, there you go. And Jeopardy. Jeopardy on the Wii U.

1187
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I'm not as good as Jeopardy. That's for smart people.

1188
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Not anymore, really. Have you ever watched Jeopardy lately?

1189
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I can only watch Celebrity Jeopardy.

1190
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And then-

1191
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Damn you, Trebek!

1192
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed on the Vita.

1193
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Oh, I was like, isn't that on every platform?

1194
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
No, not the Vita and 3DS. 3DS got delayed a little further.

1195
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
That's it, and I hate to say it, I think that's it for the rest of the year.

1196
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Well, we'll check in again next week and see what shovel week they were able to put together in a week.

1197
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Alright, meanwhile in Japan, there's still some things trickling through. Not a lot, but some things.

1198
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction in the Premium Edition coming out December 13th.

1199
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Along with, I believe this is a new game, Port Royale 3.

1200
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I don't recognize this as a series here. Maybe Loki-

1201
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It came out on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in August, I think.

1202
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's like a Pirates game.

1203
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah, it's a Pirates simulation game.

1204
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
But not Sid Meier's Pirates.

1205
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
No, it's Calypso, I want to say, puts that out.

1206
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Russell in Japan, but-

1207
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I think over here it's Calypso.

1208
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:23,000
They're the guys that put out Tropico, so it's a trading sim.

1209
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
You can be a pirate or trader.

1210
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Much busier week on the PlayStation 3, Battlefield 3 also there as well, and Port Royale 3.

1211
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Ninja Gaiden Sigma also gets a price reduction along with Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus.

1212
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:46,000
But as far as new games go, Sango Kushi 12 comes out in regular and Premium Editions from Koei.

1213
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:55,000
This is 12. What is this? Is this Nobunaga, like, a new version of it?

1214
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It very well could be.

1215
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
No, that's Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1216
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I just recognized one of the kanji.

1217
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's a big release this week too, so that wouldn't surprise me at all.

1218
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Whenever you see Sangoku, Three Kingdoms.

1219
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You run a country, build facilities, develop skills. The skills can be military-based, politics-based, or fundamental.

1220
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Or artistic dance.

1221
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No, you cannot have artistic dance.

1222
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Also, price reduction for Sangoku Basara 3 Utage.

1223
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So lots of price reductions this week, just in time for Christmas.

1224
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:38,000
On the Vita this week in Japan, Jikuyu Powerful Pro Yakuyu 2012 Petai Ban.

1225
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
That's the Konami Baseball series on the Vita this week.

1226
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
On the PSP this week, yes, the PSP.

1227
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
7th Dragon 2020 gets a price reduction.

1228
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And then we have Arcana Famiglia Festa Regalo comes out this week.

1229
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I have no idea what that is on the PSP.

1230
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
But it has free shipping.

1231
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Depending where you order it from, yes.

1232
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
These guys are dressed up like it all in little suits.

1233
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
They're little chibi suit characters, but this one has an eye patch, so you know he's rough.

1234
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Oh, he's badass.

1235
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
He is.

1236
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I have no idea.

1237
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That guy looks like a chibi Kratos, and that guy looks like a chibi Cloud, doesn't he?

1238
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah, then who's the dude with the eye patch?

1239
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I don't know.

1240
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Chibi Snake?

1241
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Could be.

1242
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Shining Hearts also on the PSP gets a price reduction this week.

1243
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Going to the Wii U.

1244
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Sangokushi 12 comes out on the Wii U this week in Japan as well.

1245
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And lastly, checking the 3DS.

1246
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Biohazard Mercenaries 3D gets a price reduction.

1247
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:50,000
And Inazuma 11 Go 2 Chrono Stone Nepuyu and Ramay come out this week from level 5.

1248
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And Rob will hyperventilate now.

1249
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yes, I will.

1250
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Oh, Puyo Puyo gets a price reduction.

1251
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Puyo Puyo.

1252
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
No one cur.

1253
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I care.

1254
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Okay, one cur.

1255
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
That does it for Japanese release dates.

1256
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
In Europe, not a damn thing.

1257
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
The end.

1258
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Seriously, not a damn thing.

1259
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
The game will be out the entire week.

1260
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
A different version for every system that has ever existed all week.

1261
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm serious.

1262
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Not a damn thing.

1263
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Just crickets?

1264
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Just crickets.

1265
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Nothing until the 17th.

1266
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Alright.

1267
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Which is not this week.

1268
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Let's do a couple more stories before the Classic Game of the Week, then.

1269
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Alright.

1270
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So, Motorola has failed to ban the Xbox in both the US and Germany.

1271
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And apparently, I guess, a judge has ruled that Google's Motorola can't ban the sales of the Xbox 360

1272
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
over a patent dispute.

1273
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And, of course, no one had any comment on it and the case moves on.

1274
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So, that's good and kind of what we thought would happen.

1275
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I don't think they would ban the sale over that, but.

1276
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, can you imagine if they just suddenly pulled the Xbox 360 off of Shells?

1277
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
They're just gonna, you know, go through the courts right now and I'm sure at the end

1278
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
that they're gonna settle or have to pay some sort of royalties or something.

1279
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Somebody's going to.

1280
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So, we'll see.

1281
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Going to a game that once could have been, but it's not gonna be, Guitar Hero 7.

1282
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Guitar Hero 7, at one point, it was gonna happen.

1283
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It was in development, but Activision canned it in 2011.

1284
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
This is all coming from an anonymous source via Kotaku, so take it with a huge grain of salt.

1285
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But, it certainly sounds plausible.

1286
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Guitar Hero 7 was going back to the roots, meaning it was only gonna use a guitar.

1287
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So, it was gonna lose the drums, the mic, and all that other stuff.

1288
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Rock Band kind of had the lock on that, so it was gonna go back to just guitar.

1289
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But, the guitar was gonna go through some changes.

1290
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
A full six strings and an extra button in the neck.

1291
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
However, the guitar apparently was expensive.

1292
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
It was a disaster. Unresponsive.

1293
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So, that was not gonna be happening.

1294
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Vicarious Visions was the team that was developing it.

1295
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:23,000
They were gonna do this thing where the music video would actually change for each song.

1296
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So, they were trying to separate themselves from Rock Band, which I applaud.

1297
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
But, I don't know. I guess maybe this music video thing wasn't really working out.

1298
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
But, maybe that would have been the theme, was making music videos like MTV.

1299
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Apparently, the songs were not that great either.

1300
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It was all the worst hits from the 1990s.

1301
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
In other words, stuff like Closing Time and Sex and Candy.

1302
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Closing Time.

1303
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Remember, that's the old outro for this show.

1304
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I know, but to tell you something else about that.

1305
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
In magazine class, last time we did it, not this semester, but last year.

1306
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
At the end of every class, we would play that song right before we had our meeting.

1307
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
That's what that song makes me think of.

1308
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And yes, some good conversation in chat.

1309
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
VX Jason XV is like, why the jump to 7?

1310
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I knew there was Guitar Hero 4.

1311
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And Oren G points out Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

1312
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
So, there were other games in between.

1313
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
That's not even counting the spinoff games.

1314
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Like, there was Band Hero.

1315
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Was that the Taylor Swift one was Band Hero?

1316
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
What was the family hero?

1317
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Who gives a crap about Taylor Swift?

1318
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I'm just saying.

1319
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It was Band Hero and then...

1320
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I don't know if they had anything else other than Band Hero.

1321
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
We all stopped paying attention after Guitar Hero 3, okay?

1322
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'm just saying.

1323
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Not to mention all the band-specific ones.

1324
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Van Halen, Aerosmith, Metallica.

1325
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Guitar Hero 7 was cancelled in the middle of its two-year development cycle.

1326
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
It could have been out by now.

1327
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It could have been.

1328
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Kind of wish they'd have a new DJ hero.

1329
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Right?

1330
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
You know, I picked up DJ Hero for 20 bucks.

1331
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
It's awesome. Seriously, the soundtrack is still awesome.

1332
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
That's a game that could have won it for the soundtrack.

1333
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I need to go back and play that game again.

1334
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
There's some really good mixes in that game.

1335
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It's awfully sad.

1336
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Well, remember a time when we didn't have seven versions of a particular game?

1337
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yes, we did.

1338
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Well, unless it was Mega Man.

1339
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
No, unless it was Street Fighter 2.

1340
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Oh yeah, there is that.

1341
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
There is that.

1342
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Is this game before or after Street Fighter 2?

1343
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
As we get into the classic game of the week,

1344
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
where Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault

1345
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and find a game that is older or about the same age as Street Fighter 2.

1346
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Contemporary.

1347
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And say, hey, you should be playing this game this week, dammit.

1348
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Yeah, dammit.

1349
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And this is another one that Dan picked out,

1350
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
because I couldn't think of anything.

1351
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Sunset Riders.

1352
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
This is a good pick.

1353
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Did you ever play it?

1354
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I did.

1355
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Sunset Riders.

1356
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Actually, I have played it.

1357
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
The only place that had one was in an arcade,

1358
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
which was a tilt arcade in Dothan, Alabama,

1359
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and then it was gone.

1360
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
But Sunset Riders is a side-scrolling game,

1361
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
and you basically run around and shoot guys with your guns,

1362
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,000
and you jump from back to back of stampeding cattle and ride horses.

1363
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And it's like, I like how the article says it's a fanciful Wild West.

1364
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Old West.

1365
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
In the co-op version, you could either do a two or four player,

1366
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
and you could get hookers and boos, Rob.

1367
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
That's always the best, isn't it? Hookers and boos.

1368
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So the game was supposed to be set, like I said, in the American Old West,

1369
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
and it's four bounty hunters who are out to get the rewards

1370
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
of the most wanted outlaws in the West.

1371
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And in between each stage, it shows you a wanted poster of whoever it is

1372
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and your reward and wanted dead or alive.

1373
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You know, that type of thing.

1374
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So you play as Steve and Billy,

1375
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and their guns are peacemakers, which are faster.

1376
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And then you have Bob and Cormano,

1377
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
which I don't even know if that's a real name,

1378
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
but I was laughing because he's wearing a pink poncho.

1379
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And they both use shotguns, so they have wider shots.

1380
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And in the two player mode,

1381
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
you actually can choose the character you want to control

1382
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
before you start the game.

1383
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
But in four player, each person is assigned to a character,

1384
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
kind of like how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was.

1385
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Just like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

1386
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
which is clearly the engine this game is using, just saying.

1387
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
This is definitely, they're trying to make lightning strike twice after that

1388
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.

1389
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
It's clearly the same hardware, which is fine.

1390
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
But this game has hookers.

1391
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
See, look, he goes in the room and there's a hooker.

1392
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had April O'Neil.

1393
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
She wasn't a hooker.

1394
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
She did have clean stuff.

1395
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Some of the pictures I've seen she is.

1396
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Clearly you haven't been on Tumblr.

1397
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Anyway, any, whatever.

1398
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Dirty Men.

1399
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Everyone can be a hooker on Tumblr.

1400
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Dirty Men.

1401
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Okay.

1402
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Especially Hawkeye.

1403
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah, well, the Hawkeye initiative is awesome.

1404
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
So, anyway, you can jump from different floors,

1405
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
which use the joystick and jump, you know, the usual thing.

1406
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You can shoot downwards diagonally or vertically while crouching.

1407
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And, I mean, it's basic, you know, run and gun controls for a game like this.

1408
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,000
You have badge shaped power-ups that you get by beating these guys carrying sacks.

1409
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The silver badge gives you a second gun,

1410
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
so you can shoot in two directions at the same time.

1411
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And the gold badge lets you fire continuously when you hold down the shoot button.

1412
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And you can use both power-ups together.

1413
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
There's eight stages and you basically have to reach the end of each stage

1414
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
and beat the bad guy and get your money.

1415
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yee-haw.

1416
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Although when I saw the first boss, I was asking Dan today,

1417
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
is he not wearing any pants?

1418
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Because it looked like he wasn't wearing pants.

1419
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I think it was just the perspective in the game.

1420
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And Dan said that the only people not wearing pants were the hookers.

1421
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And the cowgirl, which he just shot.

1422
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And those chickens.

1423
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And the chickens.

1424
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And the stampede and cattle.

1425
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
They're not wearing pants either.

1426
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Wasn't that a scene in the Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?

1427
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I don't know if I know. I haven't seen it.

1428
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So you get your power-ups, like I said, if you have rapid fire, dual fire,

1429
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
and you also get a monetary award.

1430
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Or a turkey worth $500.

1431
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I've never seen a turkey worth $500.

1432
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I'm sure that has to be...

1433
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
You're not doing enough shopping at Whole Foods.

1434
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Whole Paycheck.

1435
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:48,000
So the stages are, you have Simon Greedwell, Hawkeye Hank Hatfield,

1436
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Dark Horse, which just makes me think of Bad Horse in Dr. Horrible.

1437
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:01,000
The Smith Brothers, El Greco, wouldn't that mean the Greek?

1438
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Bob, is it like Greco, Spanish for Greek?

1439
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Sure.

1440
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Okay.

1441
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Chief Scalpem.

1442
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Oh, Scalpem, which is...

1443
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Oh, insensitive.

1444
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Paco Loco.

1445
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And Sir Richard Rose, a British man who's shooting from the balcony behind two lions.

1446
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
There were...

1447
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I'm trying to find my favorite part, which is...

1448
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Oh yeah, the stuff about the SNES version.

1449
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Okay, I'm going to get back into that.

1450
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
There were two major ports.

1451
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
There was the Mega Drive version, which was the Sega Genesis,

1452
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
where it actually...

1453
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Two of the characters in the Genesis version were given surnames when they didn't have one.

1454
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It was Billy Cool and Cormano Wild.

1455
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
So they were cool and wild, apparently.

1456
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And only four of the bosses were there, so the four chapters were divided into two stages.

1457
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And the bosses in this version were Greedwell, Paco Loco, Scalpem, and Richard Rose.

1458
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And the bounties were different. They were increased depending on who it was.

1459
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And the Genesis one had what looks like a two-player versus mode, where you could fight each other in a gunfight.

1460
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
The SNES version had fewer changes.

1461
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You could still play only up to two players at a time, but it had all eight stages with their bosses.

1462
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And all the power-ups were the same, but there were some different...

1463
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I would say...

1464
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Censoring done.

1465
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
The whore that... I'm just going to call her a whore. I don't care.

1466
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:41,000
She's supposed to be, I guess, like a bar girl, but she's totally done like an old West call girl.

1467
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
She kisses the player in stage one and the saloon dancers in stage four.

1468
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
They're dressed more conservatively.

1469
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,000
The hunter dogs were taken out of the SNES version, but they were in the Genesis version.

1470
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And the Native American enemies were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpem, who was renamed to Chief Wigwam.

1471
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yeah, because that's just as good.

1472
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And the dynamite-tossing female bandits were taken out as well, but they were still in the Genesis version.

1473
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So, yeah, sunset riders.

1474
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Which I also think is funny, because you know how when you're reading the articles they have a C also?

1475
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I love that it lists Wild West CAW boys of Moomasa.

1476
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That's just wonderful.

1477
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I like the stage where you're going along the train and shooting the bandits.

1478
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Yee-haw!

1479
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,000
You know, you say that, and then you mention Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and now I'm thinking, yee-haw, Ninja Cowboy.

1480
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Well, in chat they were talking about Gunsmoke, the NES game. You know, kind of like the other Western shooter game.

1481
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Yeah.

1482
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
See, Dan kept correcting me and saying Call Girl, and I'm like, it's a whore.

1483
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
She's a whore.

1484
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
She is a whore.

1485
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
My mom says, a whore.

1486
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
She walks the night. She is a tramp.

1487
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
There it is, your Classic Game of the Week. Sunset Riders.

1488
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And no, I'm not doing Mass Effect for Classic Game. It's not old enough yet.

1489
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
It's getting there.

1490
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I'll Classic Game you.

1491
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I don't know. It feels like it's that old.

1492
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Fine. Next week, Mass Effect.

1493
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
No. Games have to be at least ten years old. Alright.

1494
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And yes, Fifth Dream, my mom really actually does say it that way.

1495
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Who-er.

1496
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Who-er?

1497
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
My mom, well, my granddaddy said it that way.

1498
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
My granddaddy was from Bridgeport, Connecticut, and my mom's a Southern girl.

1499
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So it translated to Who-er.

1500
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Alright, enough whore talk. More talk about the Classic Game of the Week.

1501
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We need more whores!

1502
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Sunset Riders.

1503
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Whores need love too, only they charge for it.

1504
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
We've got plenty more show to come.

1505
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
We're gonna talk some Microsoft, Cloud Gaming, Idol Master.

1506
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yes, Idol Master.

1507
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And whores.

1508
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Maybe some whores.

1509
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Maybe some whores will call us at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1510
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
That is our name on Skype.

1511
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
We will be taking calls after the break.

1512
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
When we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio, stay tuned.

1513
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio Live on this Sunday evening, December the 9th of 2012, with the 485th episode of our show.

1514
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
We're about to get into rapid-fire news.

1515
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Myself and Loki here in the studio and DarkSakura in the kitchen.

1516
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
She volunteered. She's in there. She's making more latkes.

1517
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Alan, you are not prepared for the mountain of latkes that are gonna be here when you get home.

1518
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I hope you like potatoes.

1519
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And matzah.

1520
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And matzah.

1521
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
They're good, though. Not gonna lie.

1522
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
All right. Anyhow, while she finishes those up, we will get into some rapid-fire news.

1523
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I gotta talk about this real quick, though.

1524
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Loki, do you play a lot of fighting games, Loki?

1525
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
You don't talk a lot about fighting games. Do you play a lot?

1526
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
No, not really.

1527
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Not really? Did you ever play Capcom vs. SNK 2?

1528
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
That was…

1529
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I think so.

1530
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Well, you know why you probably would have played it?

1531
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Is that that was the big fighting game they had at Golf Land back when we all were playing DDR.

1532
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I've played it on my MAME cabinet, so…

1533
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Okay.

1534
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Well, during the break, we were playing just some random music from games.

1535
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
That's what we usually do for the live break.

1536
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So we can, like, get water, use the restroom, and do all that live.

1537
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
The pod…

1538
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Make… Make latkes, like DarkSakura's doing.

1539
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And what have you.

1540
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And you guys during the podcast don't get that, but we play some music.

1541
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And while the Capcom vs. SNK 2 song was playing, somebody in chat said…

1542
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Where was this?

1543
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
S2100Matt said,

1544
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
There isn't an HD remix of Capcom vs. SNK 2 coming out anytime soon, huh?

1545
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And it made me think, no there's not.

1546
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And that made me sad that there is no…

1547
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Oh my god, that's a lot.

1548
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
DarkSakura, you are making me so fat.

1549
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
So?

1550
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I am fat because of you.

1551
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Look at your life, look at your choices.

1552
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Anyway, no HD version of it.

1553
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
For me to sit on my fat ass and eat latkes and play Capcom vs. SNK 2 HD.

1554
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
That is just not happening.

1555
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
No.

1556
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That makes me sad.

1557
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Yeah.

1558
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I guess it's all the rights issues, but it is frustrating.

1559
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You see, like, DarkStalkers and Street Fighter 3.

1560
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Well, they're probably right now, they're working with, you know, Namco and that stuff.

1561
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So maybe they just, you know, because right now I think SNK is being distributed through Atlas.

1562
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Because the last game that they had was King of Fighters.

1563
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
King of Fighters, yeah.

1564
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So, I mean, I would imagine that Atlas would work with them.

1565
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
After all, I don't know if you guys know, it's Persona 4 Arena, best fighting game.

1566
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Which is very unusual.

1567
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I mean, you would think that that might go to, like, Street Fighter X Tekken or something like that.

1568
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Or even, I don't know if it's too late, but PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or something like that.

1569
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But definitely going a little bit more niche with who's winning these things.

1570
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Very interesting.

1571
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Well, sometimes the Oscars don't always go to the big budget movies.

1572
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
In fact, they often don't.

1573
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
They go to the niche stuff.

1574
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Maybe the VGA is taking a nod from that.

1575
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I don't know.

1576
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It's interesting.

1577
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's see.

1578
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Chatters are complaining that they are not getting latkes.

1579
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Come over.

1580
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Tell them to make your own damn latkes.

1581
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Dark Soccer is yelling from the kitchen, make your own damn latkes.

1582
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Dark Soccer is going to set off the smoke alarm.

1583
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Watch.

1584
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It's over.

1585
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
No, it's over here.

1586
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Yeah, good idea.

1587
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
The last thing we need.

1588
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I can say that's one thing that hasn't happened in 11 years of Orange Launch Radio is that we've had to evacuate.

1589
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I've set up the smoke alarm before when drinking bacon late at night.

1590
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
But then we had the smoke alarm defense system, whereas the giant fan aimed at the smoke alarm.

1591
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
We've had the power go out.

1592
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
We've passed out drunk during the show.

1593
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
We've never had to evacuate.

1594
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
That is.

1595
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Yeah.

1596
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1597
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
We did.

1598
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
We lost the soundboard.

1599
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
All right.

1600
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1601
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Some quick news stories for you guys.

1602
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Loki starting us off.

1603
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
So Minecraft's getting another update as they tend to do.

1604
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Of course, we know the big update, the Redstone updates coming in January.

1605
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
But until then, they're going to get some smaller updates.

1606
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
One point four six is going to be the next one.

1607
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And some of the things you can expect for one point four six that are actually available right now in Snapshot 12 W forty nine a include fireworks.

1608
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Yes, it's only, I don't know, five months late, but fireworks are getting added in.

1609
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You can actually craft different colored fireworks, fireworks that sparkle, fireworks that go higher, lower and even fireworks that are shaped like creepers.

1610
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And then also there's supposed to be some a book that you can use to enchant items and of course, other bug fixes and stuff.

1611
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But one point four six is supposed to be released sometime before Christmas.

1612
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
So next week or so.

1613
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:12,000
You know who I found out today plays Minecraft, my nine year old cousin.

1614
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I thought it was interesting. You can join the VOG network.

1615
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I think it's not. I don't trust that. We seriously had a moment.

1616
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
We had we had someone join this week and they're like, is this seriously?

1617
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
No one on here all the time. Like, I'm on here.

1618
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And his mom was telling me, do you know how many viruses we've gotten on our computer?

1619
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Because he keeps trying to find a free version of Minecraft. There is no such thing as a new version of Minecraft.

1620
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,000
There are all virus. I had I had we had to kind of explain that because it's like, yeah, you have to log in with your account.

1621
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
There's you can play in cracked servers is the only way he can get around that.

1622
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Well, it's not even I said you can do the free version that doesn't have all the I mean, he's nine.

1623
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
He's not going to miss all that stuff. Although he was asking me, he's like, have you ever built a nether portal?

1624
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I'm like, no. A nine year old just kicked my ass at a video game.

1625
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
You didn't have to because we did it all for you. There's like 50 of them.

1626
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah, I know. All right. So Last of Us was revealed to be coming out May seven.

1627
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
This is coming from the trailer that played during the VGA. So, yay.

1628
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Another game. And last but not least, in the realm of I don't give a shit about this,

1629
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,000
but we're going to report it anyways, because originally it had something to do with gaming, but now it's so far away from gaming.

1630
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
G4 or what used to be G4 is now becoming the Esquire channel.

1631
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Wow. I could really care less about that. In fact, I do care about as little about that as possible.

1632
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:49,000
But apparently it is a network that is going to be aimed at the metro sexual male.

1633
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:55,000
That has to be a joke by the writer. I don't think they actually are targeting the metro sexual male,

1634
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:03,000
although that would be kind of funny if they were. They're saying that the channel will feature some gaming oriented material.

1635
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And of course, subjects also is fashion, cooking and travel.

1636
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Vomit is what I say. I don't know. I hope this I hope this crashes and burns pretty fast.

1637
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And honestly, I think it will. Dark soccer. Do you think metro sexual is hot?

1638
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Whatever that's supposed to mean anyway. Huh? Metro sexual. I know.

1639
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
And I'm like, huh? I need to know that I like it authentic.

1640
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I want to know where they can be running reruns of Queer Eye for the straight guy, because that's, you know, pretty metro sexual right there.

1641
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
They should reboot it. Actually, what was we watched?

1642
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
What was it? We watched the pilot episode of that. And it's like, whoa, this is weird.

1643
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
The British version was really good. Different people on here. OK.

1644
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Alan's a big fan of the Nerdist and Chris Hardwick and all that. Yeah.

1645
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So, like, he likes to listen to podcasts that aren't mine. So that's fine.

1646
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
He listens to mine, too. But he likes to listen to he's probably listening now.

1647
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
In fact, he likes to listen to the Nerdist with Chris Hardwick.

1648
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:13,000
And I guess they've been doing a lot of because I guess somebody involved with that show is involved with Attack of the Show right now after Kevin Pereira left and all that.

1649
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And I guess they say that this network is supposed to be brovo is what they're calling brovo instead of Bravo.

1650
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
It's brovo. So I'm like the real dude bros of Orange County.

1651
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
What exactly does that mean? What is the real duper would be pretty?

1652
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It actually would be a fucking awesome show, dude.

1653
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Dude, dude, dude, sir, for dudes.

1654
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Fist bump, Loki fist bump.

1655
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Moving on.

1656
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:03,000
An update to the humble bundle. Do you ever fist bump people? Dark soccer all the time.

1657
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:12,000
The humble THQ bundle has added, you know, sometimes the bundles kind of add some deals later on in the life.

1658
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:18,000
The humble THQ bundle is no different. It got the Red Faction Armageddon DLC called Path of War.

1659
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Titan Quest was also added to the bundle.

1660
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Titan Quest was a Diablo style RPG created by Iron Lore Studios back when they existed.

1661
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
The humble THQ bundle. By the way, you don't have to rebuy the bundle to get those games.

1662
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Just log back into the humble bundle site or use your reuse your code, whatever.

1663
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:46,000
You'll get the games to two million dollars earned in twenty four hours, six days to go.

1664
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Actually, no, that was three days left, about three point seven million made.

1665
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So it's probably up to about four million by now. The average price of the bundle, five dollars and fifty eight cents.

1666
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And as the article here points out, four and a half shares of THQ stock.

1667
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Same price. Amazing.

1668
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I didn't know this was a thing, but more import games apparently still coming to the PlayStation Store in the form of PlayStation one classics.

1669
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And Gung Ho Online America getting these old Japanese only games and repackaging them for the PlayStation one import store.

1670
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I think it's a great idea. I don't know if I'd play any of these games, but Zanuck cross Zanuck.

1671
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Kendo rage sequel, Makaruna Makeno 2, Vehicle Cavalier, which was a vehicle combat game with mechs.

1672
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Art Kami and Suguro Kuren.

1673
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:59,000
That was a board game about Dakota trucks in Japan and Loop Salad, which was a match three puzzle game and finger flashing, which was basically a rock, paper, scissors action game.

1674
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Not naked fingers. No finger flashing like that.

1675
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I just flashed one of my fingers at Dark Sakura was the one that I retorted only to be polite.

1676
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Streets of Rage apparently at one point had a remake. I don't know what kind of like stage this concept was in.

1677
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:26,000
This could even be a fan thing for all we know. No, I don't think so. It was confirmed by the studio.

1678
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Oh, Sean Noonan was the tweeter that said seems one of my previous projects is leaked.

1679
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:38,000
So it actually kind of shows. It looked pretty bad ass. Yeah. You look in this video here. It does look kind of neat.

1680
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:45,000
It's a little more open world than side scroller, but it has that very neon look to it.

1681
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And you can, you know, watch the guys beating each other up there in the video.

1682
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Ubisoft level designer Sean Noonan. That was the guy that leaked it through Twitter.

1683
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It was reportedly in development. I'm sorry. He confirmed the leak through Twitter.

1684
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
He didn't leak it himself. Reportedly was in development at Ruffian Games.

1685
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,000
There was supposed to be destructible environments, takedowns, street gangs.

1686
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But canceled. Not happening.

1687
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Guess it just wasn't good enough. Some things are not meant to be.

1688
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:29,000
All right. That does it for my rapid fire news. Well, now, did you ever have a TI calculator?

1689
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I sure did. In AP calculus. I sure did. Well, I didn't take calculus.

1690
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I had one just so I could play pole position and then make it say rude things.

1691
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I was on my way to take calculus and I was in pre calc. Unfortunately, I spent too much time programming on my calculator.

1692
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game, but. And now we have Dissidia.

1693
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:56,000
You should see how they quit. Well, now they've made a portal on a TI 85 calculator.

1694
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
You can actually play kind of a weird version of Portal where.

1695
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I guess it's like the the flash one where it's just sort of from the side.

1696
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I couldn't really tell the video is not playing on my. Yeah, it was it was from the side.

1697
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And, you know, you could shoot portals out in like eight directions.

1698
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And they actually had puzzles and a little bit of a story that goes along.

1699
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
So it's pretty cool. That's pretty cool.

1700
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Also, on Wii U, Rayman's Legend comes out in the UK on March 1st and in North America on February 26th.

1701
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
So for people who are interested in that and have to say it's still looking good.

1702
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And then that's going to be available for people hither and yon.

1703
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And then Gianna Sister's Twisted Dreams will be on Xbox Live Arcade next spring.

1704
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They will be seeing it. It was one of the green light titles and I have it.

1705
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:59,000
It's pretty. I haven't really gotten a chance to play much of it, but we shall be seeing it on Xbox.

1706
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
There you go. Well, that's cool that it made its way to Xbox. Yeah.

1707
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Not bad for Kickstarter, huh? Yeah. It's a fantastic game that I have yet to play.

1708
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I have it. I have it. I bought it because I backed the Kickstarter, but I haven't played it yet.

1709
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1710
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
use the passphrase, cereal, as in breakfast, cereal.

1711
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Let's go to the foogle question of the week.

1712
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Every week we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook and Google+.

1713
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
You smoosh it together. That's foogle.

1714
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,000
This week I was kind of a goober and I forgot to post the question in a timely manner.

1715
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So as soon as I joined chat, they were like, Rob, you have not posted the foogle question of the week.

1716
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,000
So one of our chatters, Raginator, just said, here, I'm going to give you a question totally free of charge.

1717
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I was like, OK. And so Raginator is asking the foogle question this week.

1718
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
What is one thing that you learned in quotes from video games over the years?

1719
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I thought it was I thought it was a good question.

1720
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And you know, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.

1721
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
So if one of you wants to ask the question tonight, go for it.

1722
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I think it was a great idea. So let's see what the listeners said.

1723
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Let's start tonight on Google+. We had a couple answers on Google+.

1724
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Redertainment says, before Assassin's Creed, I didn't know Leonardo da Vinci was gay.

1725
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Now I know. And knowing is half the battle. I didn't. Is that true?

1726
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Or is that just a like stereotype? I think it's a it's a speculation.

1727
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I see. But then again, you know, that type thing was punishable by death back then.

1728
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Unfortunate act. Deaf has an answer. English.

1729
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Well, I learned the language when I was little, but video games helped me master it.

1730
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Quite probably the reason I have a B.A. in translation to never thought of that.

1731
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But what a great way to learn a language playing a video game.

1732
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Although then again, some translations may not be the best way to learn English.

1733
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I mean, some of the ones back in the day were pretty bad.

1734
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
But I think that's a really neat, you know, way to learn a language.

1735
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Think about like an MMO when you have to really surround yourself with the language.

1736
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It's immersion. Of course, you get a lot of net speak, too.

1737
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,000
That kind of screws it up. Like people typing U for Y O U.

1738
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
That's I hate it. Appreciate music.

1739
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Act F goes on to say I love music and video games helped appreciate all help me appreciate all kinds of music during my early years and especially during my teens.

1740
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Without that, probably I wouldn't be doing. I love that music, which is a segment from on Vogue Network dot com.

1741
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Today, I've learned lots of trivial things, too, but those two are the most important.

1742
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Good answers over there on Google Plus. Let's try Facebook. Quite a few answers on Facebook.

1743
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
They're all pretty short, so I'll try to read as many of these as I can.

1744
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Raginator answered his own question. I've learned that, quote, herbs, quote, are good for your health.

1745
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And I think those in Washington state would be inclined to agree.

1746
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I see the joke there. I mean, really, though, there were a lot of speaking of early RPGs.

1747
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
It was always the herb that would suddenly make you feel better and just make you forget all the pain.

1748
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:32,000
We used to say when you mix the brown, the red herb and the green herb and you got the brown pile, we would just call it the brown pile or crap.

1749
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Or you mix the green herb and the pink herb and suddenly you want to watch a lot of My Little Pony.

1750
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Nothing will make me want to watch a lot of My Little Pony, Rob.

1751
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Brandon H on Facebook said, Don't try to text in the middle of a race.

1752
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I don't know if that means Mario Kart or like an actual race, but, you know, just don't text and drive kids.

1753
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Doesn't even work in games.

1754
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Katsuhiko J replied and said, Save your game, save often. Ain't that the truth?

1755
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Surely you've lost progress in Mass Effect due to lack of saving. Yes, DarkSakura?

1756
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
No, actually, because I save often.

1757
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
All right. You learned that lesson, huh?

1758
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I also have multiple saves at the same place. I have different colors of skin and hair and different hairstyles and eye colors on my Shepard.

1759
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Nerd.

1760
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Gamer Girl replied and said, Keep calm and keep playing because nothing in a game is as bad as real life.

1761
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:32,000
At least, unlike life, in a game, there are do-overs and extra lives.

1762
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:38,000
What a nice, simple, good answer to the question, right?

1763
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Don't throw your controllers. Don't get mad. It's not real life.

1764
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And you get three lives, unlike real life.

1765
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,000
So don't kill yourself with a PlayStation 3 controller. Out of rage.

1766
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Degenerate Johnny replies and said, I've learned that Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space.

1767
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Yes. Yes.

1768
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
What is that from? I didn't get the reference.

1769
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Mass Effect 2.

1770
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Where?

1771
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Okay. When you get to the Citadel, right?

1772
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Yeah.

1773
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And there's the military guys standing out there talking to the other two across from the help desk before you go into C-Sec?

1774
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Yeah.

1775
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And he goes, What is the first law of physics? An object in motion tends to stay in motion, sir.

1776
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I did not pay you for half an answer. Give me the whole thing.

1777
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
You know, that type of thing. It's like, until acted upon about an outside object, sir.

1778
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Do you know if you shoot this missile through, you know, blah, blah, it will always hit something.

1779
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
You're just going off on it.

1780
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
That means that Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest motherfucker in the galaxy.

1781
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I don't even remember that. Is that just background dialogue?

1782
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
No. You stop and you activate them to listen to it.

1783
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I just forgot.

1784
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Broseidon. I wonder if he'll have a show on Brovo.

1785
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Broseidon answers and says, Don't ever think you're better than the game because the game decides if you're going to win,

1786
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,000
or if it might just freeze and glitch and make your past 36 hours pointless.

1787
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:08,000
You need to see the rule earlier, Broseidon, that says save now, save often.

1788
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Jovidea says, I've learned that when trying to perform operations on the Wii and Trauma Center,

1789
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
it is oftentimes easier to operate while drunk. This makes me question real doctors.

1790
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Yes, because Trauma Center is real life. Your real doctors draw a pentagram shape in order to invoke the magic.

1791
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Her. Burr replied and said, I learned you only live once. Yolo.

1792
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Wait, that can't be right. You missed the one on the three lives. Hello.

1793
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Cram replied and said, Save often. Having to replay several hours can leave a game unfinished for a long time.

1794
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Loco Poco replied and said, I've learned that flashing your breasts to your opponent is the best kind of fatality to finish them off.

1795
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Learned from Black Orchid and Killer Instinct.

1796
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Is that a good life lesson, Dark Sakura? Do you flash your breasts at opponents to kill them off?

1797
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I flash them at Dan to get him to shut up.

1798
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Close enough.

1799
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Silent Tom replies and says, I've learned over the years that the princess is always in another castle.

1800
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And if you chop down enough grass, you're bound to find money.

1801
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Those are both good life lessons, wouldn't you say?

1802
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:37,000
A sale of Sumer Gawa replies and says, if the camera focuses on it, it's important.

1803
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Here it is. Your answer. So in that alive, the breasts are important.

1804
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio and you can find our community on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.

1805
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I did learn something, by the way.

1806
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
That was a good question, Raginator. Good job.

1807
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I learned something last night, Rob.

1808
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
My hacked Mass Effect 3 will now work in multiplayer.

1809
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
As long as I don't hit the button.

1810
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Oh, you. All right. Let's move on with some more news.

1811
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So there has been a listing on LinkedIn.

1812
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:17,000
There one ads for, I guess, a Microsoft's interactive entertainment business studio Soho.

1813
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
They're seeking a television producer to develop and deliver a number of new TV products.

1814
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Basically, it says Soho Productions is pushing the boundaries of Kinect and Xbox Live and would like to bring a new line of interactive television experiences to the world.

1815
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Working with leading global entertainment partners, we're creating experiences that are not bound by the traditional definitions of television or gaming.

1816
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Experiences where watching and participating are inseparable and will delight and enrich the lives of people everywhere.

1817
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
So this kind of goes back to a few different rumors.

1818
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:03,000
One, that this might be something that's incorporated into the next Xbox system and also to that whole set top box thing that they're going to be putting out.

1819
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:10,000
To me, it sounds like they're kind of building on the whole, you know, Kinect TV stuff.

1820
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:18,000
You know, like what they did with Sesame Street and not Geo, that they're going to be doing some other types of interactive TV things.

1821
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Maybe bringing back 1 versus 100 or something like that might be kind of cool.

1822
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,000
So that's what it sounds like to me or maybe it's just something else.

1823
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:37,000
But hopefully it's not implemented really stupid like, now you can vote on this, you know, thing or something.

1824
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Do you like Xbox or not?

1825
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
You know, I think you're doing something similar for the Spike VGA.

1826
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
It's where they had it where you can stream it and interact with TV and stuff.

1827
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
They were doing it for the political debates on Xbox Live.

1828
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Yeah, so maybe they're going to be kind of doing something like that.

1829
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It seems like the way that they would go, but they're trying to maybe new content, which would be cool.

1830
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I'm all for new content, especially if it's not any additional cost to me.

1831
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Well, I think we've known for a while that they're toying with the idea of doing like a Microsoft channel type of thing on Xbox.

1832
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Or at least, you know, I don't know, more of that interactive kind of television style content.

1833
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Although it does seem weird that why would they close inside Xbox only to develop that kind of stuff?

1834
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
That's the weird part.

1835
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I don't know.

1836
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But I do think definitely something is in the works there.

1837
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Is that something that interests you, Loki?

1838
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Like I said, if it's at no additional cost to me, because I don't really have, I don't pay for cable TV right now.

1839
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,000
But I do pay for Xbox Live Gold, so it'd be nice if that was included with it.

1840
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I'd probably watch some stuff on there.

1841
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Alright, going to a service called PlayCast.

1842
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:56,000
PlayCast is an Israel-based company, and they're a cloud gaming service.

1843
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
You can think similar to OnLive.

1844
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:05,000
PlayCast is live in Portugal, France, and South Korea, which is weird because they're Israel-based, but they're in these other countries.

1845
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
But they are supposed to be launching the service in the United States early next year.

1846
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
It's a cloud service.

1847
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:19,000
It streams through set-top boxes, tablets, smartphones, and PCs, anything that can run Android 4.0 and higher.

1848
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,000
You do a subscription package that's tailored to a user.

1849
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Kind of interesting.

1850
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:32,000
So like, in the service in France right now, there's a package that's more tailored to casual gamers, and then one that's tailored at the more hardcore.

1851
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So it's kind of like you would, I guess since we're talking about TVs and channels, you'd be buying, like Comcast, right?

1852
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:46,000
When you sign up for their service, you can get like the sports channel package, or the, you know, entertainment channel package, or whatever, movie channels.

1853
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
So kind of taking that idea to cloud gaming service.

1854
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Interesting. Interesting.

1855
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:01,000
PlayCast is aiming towards what they call the mid-core market, a group that enjoys gaming but isn't going online in their favorite shooter every day.

1856
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So maybe not the type of people that listen to this show, but people that still enjoy gaming.

1857
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Apparently, if you use multiple devices, so like let's say you play on your TV through a PC, and then you can now use your phone or tablet as a controller.

1858
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
PlayCast will instantly recognize the activity when you sign in with the auxiliary device.

1859
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
You can create your own skins with the tablet or what have you, and customize the look and layout of the interface.

1860
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:45,000
No word on exactly when this launches in the U.S. Of course, nothing on subscription prices, but it should be noted that PlayCast does have deals with Activision, Warner Brothers, Telltale, THQ, Codemasters, and these other countries.

1861
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
They are also trying to get indies on board.

1862
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Consumer Electronics Show may bring us more information when that occurs January 8th through the 11th in Vegas.

1863
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Interesting.

1864
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I don't know, I'm not super big on these cloud gaming things, and I'm more of the type of gamer where it's like, I'll just buy the games I want to play.

1865
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:14,000
But I can see the idea of, you know, go after the audience that maybe isn't as hardcore as I am.

1866
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I just don't want to put stuff that I'm paying for in somebody else's hands.

1867
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Yeah. It depends on the price though. If it were super cheap, it might be awesome. But I kind of doubt it's going to be that cheap.

1868
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Dark Sakura.

1869
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Well here is a big rumor. Now, have you ever heard of Idolmaster?

1870
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Yes I have.

1871
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Well, there is a...

1872
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I've been reading Japanese release dates for how long on this show? Yes, I've heard of Idolmaster.

1873
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Rob, it's called leading into a story. Hello.

1874
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Okay, my bad.

1875
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Well anyway, Namco Bandai registered two different trademarks in Europe. One of them is the Idolmaster and the other is Shiny Festa.

1876
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Which is one of the titles of a recent Idolmaster spinoff that's on the PSP.

1877
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:08,000
So maybe we'll be getting Idolmaster. I mean, that looks like they're going to Europe first.

1878
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,000
But I honestly think that if they did it there, they'd do it here. Don't you think?

1879
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:23,000
And really what this is, the Idolmaster games, you basically manage a pop star's career. Sort of like a Tamagotchi game.

1880
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Shiny Festa is just a rhythm game that sort of follows after Project D.Va.

1881
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Do you have to clean up their poop too? Like Tamagotchi? No.

1882
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
You have not taken a bath. Go bathe.

1883
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Okay.

1884
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Bathe is slower.

1885
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Rub.

1886
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And hence.

1887
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Anyway. So yeah, it could get localized.

1888
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Alrighty, well we'll see. I mean, I don't know. Trademark may just be preventing another company from coming in and releasing their own game called Idolmaster.

1889
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:11,000
But I don't know. You would think there'd be an audience for it here. It's not going to be a huge thing like it is over there.

1890
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But there's certainly enough people that are into the Japanese culture alone that would want to check it out just because it's been so big over there.

1891
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
It could be a cult game, I think is what they'd call it.

1892
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Who knows? I mean, we've seen other things happen. You know, games like that gain popularity.

1893
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I mean, would we have had Elite Beat agents otherwise?

1894
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
That'd be neat. I don't know. Not my thing.

1895
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:43,000
So this is kind of funny. We were talking a little bit about Killer Instinct and boob flashing, so that's awesome.

1896
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
But this may stop another Killer Instinct game coming out.

1897
01:51:49,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Apparently Microsoft at least tried to renew the trademark of Killer Instinct, but it's been rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the basis of likelihood of confusion.

1898
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Apparently this has to do with a short-lived Fox show called Killer Instinct from 1995.

1899
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Because I know everybody that you talk about Killer Instinct thinks of the Fox show and not, I don't know, the fighting game series.

1900
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I've never heard of that show.

1901
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Somebody at the Trademark Office did.

1902
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Yeah, a really obscure person that probably, you know, that's my favorite show!

1903
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Same person probably also has episodes of Silk Stockings on tape.

1904
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Hey, Silk Stockings was awesome.

1905
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
That was some good skinimax right there.

1906
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Anyways, and David Duchovny, you rock on.

1907
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Anyways, so basically said that, you know, they're probably going to be trying to, I guess, maybe appeal that or something.

1908
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I don't know.

1909
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Right now they said this happens to a lot of trademark applications and by no means is the final say on the application.

1910
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
It just means that Microsoft has to provide more evidence to overcome their objection.

1911
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I would say, you know, ask the average person on three.

1912
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:12,000
So, Killer Instinct, is that an arcade game or a show from 1995?

1913
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I'm going to be like, what?

1914
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I'm looking at some clips of Killer Instinct here on, I'm thinking this is the intro to the show or whatever, here on good old YouTube.

1915
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
But yeah, this is the movie for dialogue.

1916
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Who doesn't star?

1917
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Marguerite Moreau.

1918
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I don't...

1919
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
That's a lot of nothing.

1920
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I miss her too.

1921
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:41,000
That's totally...

1922
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
What? They're making a game based...

1923
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
They don't even talk.

1924
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
They're making a game based on my favorite show from 1995.

1925
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
That's fantastic.

1926
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
2005, actually.

1927
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Just so you know.

1928
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
It said 1995.

1929
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
No, it's 2005, that one that I'm looking at there.

1930
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
It's 2005.

1931
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Oh really?

1932
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Yeah.

1933
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
It's wrong.

1934
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:04,000
But anyway, the game was 95, wasn't it?

1935
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Maybe.

1936
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Yeah, it was because I was in college in Alabama.

1937
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Anyway.

1938
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Kicking people's asses.

1939
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Anyway, it's not that they make games based off of shows.

1940
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Like CSI has games.

1941
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Survivor has games that aren't very good.

1942
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Wheel of Fortune, you just said, has a game coming out next week.

1943
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
So surely Killer Instinct, a canceled show from 8 years ago.

1944
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
It was 2005.

1945
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
My mistake, not 1995.

1946
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Surely a canceled series from 7 years ago might have a game at some point.

1947
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
So therefore...

1948
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I know.

1949
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Considering that it ran a whole, what, 13 episodes?

1950
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Wow.

1951
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
People would totally...

1952
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
No, I'm sorry.

1953
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Not even 13 episodes because 4 of those episodes were unaired.

1954
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
So, uh...

1955
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,000
According to GameGuru, sounds like your typical canceled Fox show.

1956
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Yes.

1957
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
So 9 episodes.

1958
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Yeah, people are gonna totally confuse it for that piece of shit.

1959
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I'm sure, you know.

1960
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:09,000
We would get a Wonder Falls video game before we would get a Killer Instinct video game based off the show.

1961
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I'm pretty sure this will be appealing.

1962
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Oh my god.

1963
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
You know what this sounds like?

1964
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,000
This sounds like a really crappy ripoff of Law and Order SVU.

1965
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It probably is.

1966
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
They're part of the, get this, the Deviant Crimes Unit.

1967
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
The DCU.

1968
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Yeah.

1969
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
The DCU.

1970
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Totally not a ripoff of the SVU.

1971
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Well, it just goes to show that, you know, intellectual property laws in this country are kind of borked.

1972
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I mean, just...

1973
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I mean, technically, by the same logic, this show shouldn't have existed in the first place because of the game.

1974
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
We were talking about Gunsmoke earlier.

1975
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:53,000
That game was actually called Gun.Smoke because of the TV show.

1976
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
But come on, everybody called it Gunsmoke.

1977
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And, you know, if you're talking in the context of a game, you know the game.

1978
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
And if you're talking about television, classic TV, you know the show.

1979
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Like, you just, you just know.

1980
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Anyway.

1981
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Chief McBride was in it. He's awesome.

1982
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Who?

1983
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Chief McBride.

1984
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Oh.

1985
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
The guy from Pushing Daisies.

1986
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

1987
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
It was like her mentor or whatever.

1988
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1989
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I didn't know that.

1990
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Oddly enough, some Mega Man news this week.

1991
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
In light of the 25th anniversary, a couple things, believe it or not.

1992
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
An 8-bit fan game had a little preview this week.

1993
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
The Mega Man 25th anniversary.

1994
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
This is a Canadian-based group, Team Reverbot.

1995
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:43,000
But it's kind of a Voltron of various, you know, people here.

1996
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
You have Julian Spillane from DHX Media or Silicon Knights.

1997
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Jason Kanam from Drinkbox Studios.

1998
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Ori Falconer and Daniel Ochoa from Vast Studios.

1999
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And Tim McLennan from Gameloft.

2000
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And then an independent artist, Jeff Kanam.

2001
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
So this is, you know, again, it's kind of your basic NES throwback.

2002
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
But with, like, all new bosses.

2003
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And I can play a little preview here.

2004
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,000
You know, it's not all that different from Mega Man 9 and 10.

2005
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Because people seem to love their retro Mega Mans.

2006
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
But, like, see, that guy actually shoots acid.

2007
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Which is in line with the theme stage here.

2008
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
They even have all new bosses, right?

2009
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Like, there's actually Sledge Man, Bio Man, Tarot Man.

2010
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Kendo Man, Amp Man, Neon Man, Comet Man, and Totem Man.

2011
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Are all the new little bosses there.

2012
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
If this little clip of the boss select screen is to be believed.

2013
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Interesting.

2014
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Actually, one of my friends in Japan just was posting something from Cap Community related to Mega Man.

2015
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
I think it might be this other thing, probably, that I'm about to mention.

2016
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
The Street Fighter X Mega Man.

2017
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Actually, yes.

2018
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yes, that's what it is.

2019
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
This was also something that was announced.

2020
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
This is a little more official.

2021
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
That other one was more of a, like, indie whatever.

2022
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
This is a little more official.

2023
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Sort of, though.

2024
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
The interesting thing about this.

2025
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
This project, the Street Fighter X Mega Man, has been going on for a while.

2026
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
And you can find the guy's YouTube channel and find these old concept videos from, like, three years ago.

2027
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
So this has been being worked on for quite some time.

2028
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
At some point, Capcom caught wind of it.

2029
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Because now Capcom is going to be the ones that are sending it out through their Unity blog.

2030
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
The Capcom Unity blog.

2031
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And they're going to make it a free download on December 17th, 2012.

2032
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:40,000
You know, for all the shit that Capcom gets for pissing off their fanbase over the past year,

2033
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:46,000
this is a very interesting kind of band-aid to try and make it right with the community.

2034
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Because, you know, they see this indie project's going on.

2035
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:54,000
And for all practical purposes, they have every right to shut the damn thing down.

2036
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,000
But they've learned from watching what happens to other stuff when that goes on,

2037
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
that this is going to get out there to the internet anyway.

2038
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So let's embrace it, give the guy a little guidance, and then, you know, give it out as a goodwill thing for free,

2039
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
and end up giving the guy some exposure.

2040
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
And it looks kind of neat.

2041
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,000
It kind of does the whole parody of, like, Mega Man 2 here in the intro, but...

2042
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
You can see, like, Ryu's stage.

2043
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:26,000
It even does these interesting things where, like, the bosses have, because they're Street Fighter characters,

2044
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
have, like, super meters.

2045
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
The bosses have, like, super meters.

2046
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And once they fill up, it'll do, like, this little zoom in, and they do their super attack.

2047
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
It's kind of funny.

2048
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I was watching some of the old concept videos online, so...

2049
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,000
It's really neat that it came to life.

2050
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I kind of wonder if the guy got any help officially from Capcom, or what.

2051
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I don't know.

2052
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Well, you can get it free on December 17th.

2053
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
By the way, the super fan behind this, Sonic, is the name he uses online.

2054
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Xiao Zong Hui.

2055
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
He's a pro-competitive gamer, additionally.

2056
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Very cool.

2057
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Yay, I love this music.

2058
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Filled, uh, end of game music.

2059
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
You know, um, Brentlefloss did lyrics to it.

2060
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Of course.

2061
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Anyway.

2062
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Anyway.

2063
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I love looking at the little chibi Street Fighter characters done up in Mega Man style.

2064
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I think that's awesome.

2065
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
So.

2066
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Alright.

2067
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Going back to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

2068
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
GameGuru commented on that last story about Killer Instinct,

2069
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:43,000
saying that the TV show came out right as Nintendo let that Killer Instinct trademark expire.

2070
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
So, a small correction to me getting angry there a minute ago.

2071
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Good to know.

2072
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat, talking on this Capcom Mega Man thing, says,

2073
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Yeah, the way Capcom handled that made me even more interested in checking it out.

2074
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I'm always down for more retro Mega Man.

2075
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Panaxium in chat says,

2076
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I'd play it if my reflexes weren't shit.

2077
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I'm getting old.

2078
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Yeah, you and me both.

2079
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Hopefully there's an easy mode.

2080
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Like Mega Man 2 style easy mode.

2081
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Alright, more news.

2082
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Dark Sakura.

2083
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
News?

2084
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Oh, I'm sorry, we're to the mailbag.

2085
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Yeah!

2086
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Well, the news is, you all emailed us, and now we're gonna give you answers.

2087
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Fucking hell.

2088
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Mailbag at Orangelandrado.com.

2089
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Again, that's mailbag at Orangelandrado.com.

2090
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Dark Sakura's gonna dive in the mailbag head first, and pick out a few emails.

2091
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,000
And, we were actually kind of, like, some weeks we get no emails whatsoever.

2092
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
This week, we got a bunch.

2093
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
All the emails.

2094
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
All the emails.

2095
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
So, Dark Sakura I think can only read some tonight, but she's gonna pick some and read them.

2096
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I'll go through them.

2097
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Goodie.

2098
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Surtur here.

2099
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
What are the good games?

2100
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I don't know.

2101
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
What are the good games?

2102
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Is that the whole sentence?

2103
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
No.

2104
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Oh.

2105
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I like JRPGs.

2106
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I have Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, and Animal Crossing Wild World.

2107
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Which, I guess that isn't really a JRPG.

2108
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
It's more of a kind of a sim, I guess.

2109
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
What are other good games?

2110
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
What do you think if the world ends with you?

2111
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Love the show.

2112
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I'm gonna guess he left out a sentence for the DS.

2113
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Because all those games he named are DS games, right?

2114
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I guess.

2115
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
So, what are good DS games?

2116
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Dan likes Fire Emblem.

2117
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I mean, that's more of a strategy RPG.

2118
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Um, you know what game is surprisingly good?

2119
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Is the Cardhouse one.

2120
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
The 30, the Clubhouse games.

2121
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
That's what it is.

2122
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Clubhouse games is really good.

2123
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Maybe he's looking specifically for JRPGs.

2124
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I mean, you could play Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV.

2125
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Yeah, the Final Fantasy IV, III, and IV remakes are really good on DS.

2126
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
By the way, side story.

2127
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Did you hear about Final Fantasy IV is getting its iOS release like Final Fantasy III did?

2128
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Good.

2129
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Final Fantasy IV is gonna be coming out for what?

2130
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Android and iPad and iPhone and all that stuff?

2131
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Android, meh.

2132
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Hey, I'm just saying.

2133
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
It's coming out for all those systems before the end of the year, I think.

2134
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
At least in Japan.

2135
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Next email.

2136
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Howdy, OLR.

2137
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
It's your favorite catastrophic magi.

2138
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Unfortunately, this week I come bearing sad news.

2139
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Unlike every other time I've emailed recently

2140
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
where I bitch about release dates for certain games, or lack thereof.

2141
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I'm sure the name will mean little to you, but earlier today, Sir Patrick Moore

2142
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I know who that is, by the way

2143
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
passed away at the age of 89.

2144
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
He was best known as an astronomer and the host of the long-running BBC TV show, The Sky at Night.

2145
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
How does this relate to gaming, though?

2146
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Well, to gamers in the early 90s, he was also known as the Games Master

2147
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
from a TV show of the same name, doling out tips and cheats every week

2148
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
as well as challenges to contestants.

2149
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
And then he links a video to it going forward.

2150
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
The Games Master was the gaming TV show in the UK

2151
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
in my far from humble opinion

2152
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
and has never been bested, let alone equaled.

2153
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Goodbye, Games Master.

2154
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Total goodbye.

2155
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I never saw it, so I don't have that emotional attachment

2156
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
but I can imagine.

2157
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I knew who he was as an astronomer.

2158
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Imagine the day when Mark Summers passes away.

2159
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
We are all going to have a cry.

2160
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
We're all going to throw green slime at you.

2161
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
You know what's funny about Mark Summers?

2162
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
He was pathologically...

2163
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Yeah, OCD.

2164
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Yeah, as far as things...

2165
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
He hated dirty anything.

2166
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Hey, it was a job.

2167
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
By the way, going back to the DS email,

2168
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Meteos is like my favorite DS game.

2169
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
It's a puzzler and it's great.

2170
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I have my plea appeal.

2171
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
It's not a JRPG, sorry, but Meteos is great.

2172
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I'm just saying it's a great game.

2173
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Since he left out a sentence in that email,

2174
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I'm just going to make up what it said.

2175
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Way to assume, Rob.

2176
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Yes, that's what I do.

2177
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Next up, hello, OLR crew.

2178
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
This is Rom...

2179
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I'm going to butcher this.

2180
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Romaditya from Indonesia.

2181
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I think that's actually right.

2182
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
This email is probably rather personal

2183
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
because we are fellow gamers.

2184
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I think that's all right for me to ask your blessings.

2185
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Yes, I just got married.

2186
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Congrats.

2187
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I write this email soon after the party is over.

2188
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
It's December the 9th.

2189
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Wait a minute.

2190
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
When the marriage and the celebration of the party is over,

2191
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
don't email your favorite podcast.

2192
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Get to the baby makings.

2193
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Consummate.

2194
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I'm going to assume he meant after all of that.

2195
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I know that marriage is such a common thing,

2196
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
but for me, it is special.

2197
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
What I mean is how it will make my gaming life special.

2198
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
As a blind person like me,

2199
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
it is very difficult to enjoy video games.

2200
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
An 8-bit, 16-bit era were the only great memories

2201
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I could remember.

2202
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
It is fortunate that my wife is also a gamer.

2203
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Even though she cannot play modern games very well,

2204
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
she has the ability to translate what's on the screen

2205
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
to my imagination.

2206
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,000
So she agrees to help me re-enjoy my childhood memories.

2207
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Well, we decided to snatch an Atari 2600,

2208
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
sorry, NES, Genesis, and SNES.

2209
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
We will start by playing the simple games

2210
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
like Galaxian or Pac-Man

2211
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
and continue to Super Mario Brothers.

2212
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
The way I will play the game is like this.

2213
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
She will explain to me what to do,

2214
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
and I will play it with my game and the controller.

2215
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
For example, go left, don't go right, et cetera.

2216
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
That way, for instance, I can still play Galaxian and so on.

2217
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Our best collaboration was when we finished Contra

2218
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
with 30 lives code.

2219
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Well, that's all for now.

2220
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I hope this little story can inspire other people,

2221
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
even with disabilities,

2222
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
that they can still enjoy video games.

2223
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,000
PS, we'll send you real-time video of how I play games.

2224
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
PPS, this is a little pic for my marriage party.

2225
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Oh, I'm going to look at it.

2226
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I tried to look at it.

2227
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
It was blocked on Facebook.

2228
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Yeah, it's blocked. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2229
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,000
We would love to enjoy your photo.

2230
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I think that story is so cute, though.

2231
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
It is.

2232
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I mean, it's just, that's great.

2233
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I love that story. I do.

2234
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,000
You and Dan, you told me you guys kind of do something similar, too,

2235
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
in your relationship.

2236
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:49,000
You're not facing a disability on the severity of blindness.

2237
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I faced motion sickness.

2238
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Well, yeah, that's a thing.

2239
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
And your ergonomic thing with your hand.

2240
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Well, this was before my hand.

2241
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Okay.

2242
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
But we would play Resident Evil 2,

2243
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
and I'd welcome through the game with the strategy guide.

2244
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I mean, because I couldn't watch the screen all the time.

2245
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I'd get a little motion sick.

2246
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
But it's something we would do together.

2247
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Okay, so moving forward.

2248
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Alan and I level characters in Warcraft together.

2249
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
At least we did.

2250
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
We did his first character.

2251
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
What about our paladins?

2252
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Our paladin pals?

2253
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
You and I aren't in a relationship.

2254
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
No, I'm just kidding.

2255
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Our paladin pals were fun.

2256
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
They can be friends.

2257
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Shane and I have leveled, like, at least three characters together.

2258
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
It's a fun friend thing to do, too.

2259
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I need someone to finish leveling.

2260
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
We just set a time, and we'll do it.

2261
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Help me level my stupid troll.

2262
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
God, anyway.

2263
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Wait, Loki, do you and Nellie do any bonding thing?

2264
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Oh, please.

2265
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Come on.

2266
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
You play the game, and she mocks you.

2267
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I wonder if she's asking in the night.

2268
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
She's like, I don't know, like, what are you doing?

2269
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I'm hunting dingos.

2270
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Did they eat your baby?

2271
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I don't know.

2272
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
They try to attack you, and then you skin them.

2273
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
For the record, the challenge is still out there.

2274
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I will still play Minecraft if someone buys it for me.

2275
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Just saying.

2276
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Oh, it is haunted.

2277
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I was going to say, Christmas is coming up, but actually,

2278
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
your holiday is going on right now, so oops.

2279
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I don't really care.

2280
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I know.

2281
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Hey, gang.

2282
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I just thought I would drop a line and say hey.

2283
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Hey.

2284
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Hey.

2285
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I watched the VGAs last night, and I must say I was very impressed

2286
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
with the Game of the Year winner.

2287
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I just finished The Walking Dead about two weeks ago.

2288
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I found myself finishing an episode, or sitting in my office and pondering

2289
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
whether the decisions I made were the right ones.

2290
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
And that's when you know you've played a great game.

2291
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,000
So good work, Telltale, for beating the Call of Duty's Borderlands

2292
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
and all the other big-name AAA games.

2293
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:43,000
It goes to show what you, I guess that means what you can do.

2294
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
If you take an old-school remedy and modernize it a tad,

2295
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
it can be video game gold.

2296
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I also wanted to ask Loki, knowing that you're a big GTA fan,

2297
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
I was wondering if you ever played Sleeping Dogs.

2298
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Yes, I have played Sleeping Dogs.

2299
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I just started playing after picking it up on the Steam Thanksgiving sale,

2300
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
and I'm pretty blown away.

2301
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I didn't have a very high expectation when I started it,

2302
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
yet I am having a blast playing it.

2303
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
So check it out if you haven't, and if you have, what did you think?

2304
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
I thought it was pretty fun, although I got bored of it pretty quick.

2305
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Moved on to other things.

2306
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Now everyone stop what you're doing, and it should be Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E,

2307
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
not Y-O-U-R. I will correct everyone who does this.

2308
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Grammar lessons with dark soccer.

2309
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
You know what? It's stupid.

2310
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
You learn this when you're in second grade. I mean, jeez.

2311
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Just blame autocorrect.

2312
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:38,000
No, I'm not blaming autocorrect. I'm blaming people being lazy.

2313
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Where was I?

2314
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
And if you haven't yet, go play The Walking Dead.

2315
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Oh, one more thing, after I complete Dogs That Aren't Awake,

2316
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I'm going to pick up Far Cry 3.

2317
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I wasn't a fan of 2, though. I have it on PS3 and Steam.

2318
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Just didn't find it appealing, so if any of you have played 2 or 3,

2319
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
your thoughts are 4 for 4.

2320
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Keep up the good work, Travis.

2321
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
That's a low-key question as far as Far Cry goes.

2322
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I didn't play Far Cry.

2323
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Walking Dead, I'm making it a point.

2324
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I will play that before the end of the year.

2325
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I'm not going to name a game of the year until I've at least played that,

2326
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
because that's what everybody really seems to be into.

2327
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I'm making it a point to play more Mass Effect 3.

2328
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
That's a pretty dull point.

2329
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
You know what?

2330
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Yeah, go ahead.

2331
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I have a butt bite it.

2332
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Yes, low-key.

2333
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Far Cry 3 is awesome.

2334
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
What about 2?

2335
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:28,000
2, I didn't play, because the same reason why I didn't like Dead Rising,

2336
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
you have malaria in the game.

2337
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
So you have to constantly give yourself medication bullshit like that.

2338
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I don't like that.

2339
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Dead Rising 2 sucked, because of that crap.

2340
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
And then I got Dead Rising 2 off the record, and I'm like,

2341
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Oh, sweet.

2342
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I'm not going to worry about the stupid having to get medicine for a stupid girl.

2343
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Oh, but then guess what, Frank West, he has the problem,

2344
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
and he needs to get the fucking Zombrex for himself.

2345
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I'm like, gone.

2346
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Get rid of this game, because it's absolute shit.

2347
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,000
So no, I do not enjoy games that you have malaria in.

2348
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
But Far Cry 3 is awesome, because you do not have malaria in that.

2349
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Malaria-free games are awesome.

2350
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Exactly.

2351
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I should call in sick to work with malaria.

2352
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Sorry, Mosquito bit me, even though they're in larval stage right now.

2353
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Hey, guys, I'm a new listener, and I've got to say that you guys have one awesome show.

2354
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Thank you.

2355
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Well, thanks.

2356
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I've only been listening for a few weeks,

2357
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
and I already feel like you guys are close friends that I've known forever.

2358
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Yay.

2359
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I've had very similar problems, and in my life, I've been having headaches.

2360
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Stripes just passed away, I'm sorry.

2361
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Aw.

2362
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
And he always laid in my lap while I played Minecraft and Xbox,

2363
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,000
but the point is that you have a great way to make the show feel like a great chat with friends

2364
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
and keep up the good work.

2365
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
That was our goal.

2366
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Yes.

2367
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Mission accomplished.

2368
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Yeah, exactly.

2369
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Mission accomplished.

2370
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Thank you for validating exactly what we sent out to do.

2371
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:03,000
We wanted this podcast to be exactly what dinner after playing DDR at the arcade for a night was,

2372
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:09,000
which was just sitting around talking some smack, having a good time, being bros, right, Jamie?

2373
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Yeah, brofist.

2374
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Brofist.

2375
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Dude, bros.

2376
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:19,000
You know, every time you say that, though, I think of John's wow character, bro dude.

2377
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,000
And I almost made, like, girl chick just to be funny.

2378
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
You should have.

2379
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I should have, but no one's ever on that server.

2380
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
But anyhow, thank you for validating what we're trying to do.

2381
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Yes.

2382
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Appreciate it.

2383
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Thanks.

2384
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2385
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.

2386
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Fried bologna hole.

2387
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Is that what he called it?

2388
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Yeah.

2389
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Equating it to wow.

2390
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
He completely missed the fact that while is always updating and adding new things to the game.

2391
02:12:52,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Do you think that anything resembling logic runs through his brain before he opens his fried bologna hole without comparing COD to other games?

2392
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Do you think they have a right or should charge for online play?

2393
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Fun fact.

2394
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I don't play either COD or wow as I hate them both.

2395
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Games do charge for online play.

2396
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Have you missed the online pass train?

2397
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Did you forget about that?

2398
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
That was the thing.

2399
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
What was he talking about?

2400
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Games charging for online play?

2401
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Apparently.

2402
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Read the first part of the email again.

2403
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.

2404
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Equating it to wow.

2405
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Well, I agree with that in one state.

2406
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Only one reason.

2407
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I think if they went throughout where, because a lot of people just buy it for the multiplayer.

2408
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:48,000
In which case, if they sold it like killer, not killer instinct, but kill zone where they have the multiplayer version that you can buy for 15 bucks.

2409
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
That portion of the game and that's all you get.

2410
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
That might be worth it.

2411
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,000
They could probably charge for multiplayer that way and sell maybe some more copies.

2412
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:10,000
But as of right now, just because they're down by half a million copies, they sold over 7 million copies in the first month.

2413
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I don't say that's a failure of a game.

2414
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Yeah, okay, it's a little less than last year, but that is way better than 99% of the games sold right now.

2415
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I mean, they break their, the only reason they, I guess what, they didn't surpass the last year and the year before last records.

2416
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
But come on, it's not gonna always increase.

2417
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,000
8 million copies sold is just ridiculous.

2418
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
You don't charge to play online when you're already charging to play online on the Xbox.

2419
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
That's what Xbox Gold is.

2420
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I'm telling you, the minute I get double dipped for this shit, my Xbox is going for sale on eBay.

2421
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I'll even autograph it.

2422
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
And hey, hey.

2423
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
It's gone.

2424
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I don't want Xbox anymore if I start getting double dipped.

2425
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Hey, dipshit Michael Patcher, they already charge for playing Call of Duty Online.

2426
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:02,000
There is a Hong Kong version, or Chinese or Hong Kong version of Call of Duty, Call of Duty Online, which is an MMO.

2427
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:05,000
You charge to play online.

2428
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
So, they've already done that.

2429
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Some comments from our chat room.

2430
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Raginator says, Patcher should just blow it out his fried bologna hole.

2431
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:18,000
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, I think his mouth resembles more like Wanda's macaroni salad.

2432
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Oh, I see what you did there.

2433
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Alright, moving on.

2434
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Is that the right word?

2435
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Oh, no.

2436
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Is there more email?

2437
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
No.

2438
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Yeah, there is, but there was more to that one.

2439
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Yes.

2440
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
It says, good day citizens, serious turtle.

2441
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Oh.

2442
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
And this is the last email that matters.

2443
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
I'm kidding.

2444
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I'm sure achievements and trophies aren't such a big thing for you guys, but do you sort of wish Steam's achievements added up to an overall gamer score as with Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network, or even iOS slash Mac Game Center?

2445
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
And that comes from Robert M.

2446
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,000
It'd be okay, but it's not a deal breaker. I don't really care.

2447
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Like, are we talking like a unified achievement system?

2448
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:10,000
That's kind of what the website Raptor tries to do a little bit. R.A.P.T.R. I think it's spelled.

2449
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
That's kind of what they're trying to do with their site.

2450
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but they try to track all your gaming.

2451
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
It didn't track my game progress in Grand Theft Auto 4.

2452
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Although I know it's retroactive, but like I played the fuck out of Grand Theft Auto 4 and it says I haven't played it at all.

2453
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Was that on 360 or?

2454
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Yes.

2455
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:30,000
That's weird because it picks up all my Mass Effect activity and all that stuff.

2456
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Yeah, but stuff that you'd played before you joined Raptor or during?

2457
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh, I thought I picked up the befores. Not the hours. It doesn't pick up the hours from before.

2458
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Oh, it should have because I played the fuck out of that.

2459
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I'll tell you what, I hate the crap out of Origin.

2460
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I do too.

2461
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Which is why I always at least run my Mass Effect 3 through Steam so that it'll pop up through Steam and then Origin.

2462
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I'm not sure there's a way to really unify all that though, unfortunately.

2463
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Like, sorry to the emailer, but I think some people are trying to create online.

2464
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I've heard of a gaming social network, and I can't remember the name, that I think is aspiring to do something very similar as well.

2465
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:11,000
So you have these different startups that are kind of competing to fill that void of, you know, your universal gaming badge.

2466
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:14,000
But nobody's really cracked into the mainstream yet.

2467
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:19,000
I mean, Raptor's probably the biggest one I can think of, but they're not a Twitter, they're not a Facebook yet.

2468
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:24,000
They're still very, very niche, and I bet a lot of gamers still haven't heard of them.

2469
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Hitstun in chat says, Raptor's pretty nice, but there's plenty of stuff it doesn't track, like Minecraft with third-party launchers.

2470
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,000
And it tries to make you use their shitty web browser, but the stats are nice.

2471
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
So, there you have it.

2472
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Right, that's it.

2473
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
That's it, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you wish to send us emails in the future.

2474
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
This is the part of the show where we get angsty.

2475
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
All this is bad.

2476
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Here is justice.

2477
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Here is punishment.

2478
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Here.

2479
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
This is fucked up.

2480
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I actually can't really say anything about it.

2481
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:13,000
So, it's a blanket F you to a situation that I really can't do much about right now.

2482
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
That's it.

2483
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Loki.

2484
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I figured it would be so expensive.

2485
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I'm actually looking at this real quickly going through Newegg to see if I could create one of those Alienware PCs that they have for cheaper than obviously they offer them.

2486
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
And yeah, you probably can.

2487
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
But it's still expensive.

2488
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Um, F you to latkes.

2489
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Do you know how fat you've made me tonight?

2490
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
No.

2491
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Do you know how many hours on the treadmill I won't spend burning this off?

2492
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
No.

2493
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Rob, potassium.

2494
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I eat bananas.

2495
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Actually, potatoes have more potassium.

2496
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Really?

2497
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I'm gonna find it for you.

2498
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
You gonna find me a study?

2499
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
A scientific study?

2500
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Alright, let's do a couple more news stories and then we'll go to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2501
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
But not just yet, we do have a couple more stories for you guys.

2502
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Loki.

2503
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Yes, because you know Hitman has had its share of really bad marketing ideas and well, there's yet another one.

2504
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Apparently they had a Facebook promotion where you can do a hire Hitman app for Facebook.

2505
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:36,000
What it basically did was it allowed you to create these hits on different people and of course, you know, some of the reasons I guess.

2506
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Target identified by, and then there's a drop down box, reason for target elimination.

2507
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:51,000
So like some of the target identified by things are her small tits or her muffin top or her hairy legs or her ginger hair and that kind of stuff.

2508
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Some ridiculous things.

2509
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Apparently people took offense to that.

2510
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Oh, you think?

2511
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Yeah.

2512
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Imagine that, Loki.

2513
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I can't possibly imagine how this could have possibly been offensive.

2514
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Putting a hit out on your friend because they have hairy legs and small tits.

2515
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I can't, I mean, the madness of it all.

2516
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:25,000
And I guess they also had, like I said, not only when you fill that thing out, I guess if your friend receives the app or whatever,

2517
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:32,000
it says they were going to not only receive these death threats, but they were going to witness their full on hits,

2518
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:39,000
including I guess their friend going through the process, flash pictures of their profile or something like that before their eyes, before they were killed.

2519
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:45,000
And then I guess when they are killed, it tells the reason why.

2520
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:53,000
You know, because Bob thought that your tits were small and that you were cheating on your partner or some garbage like that.

2521
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:02,000
And I guess, yeah, I guess people were kind of offended by that.

2522
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,000
And of course, we're sorry for any offense caused by this.

2523
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Like, where was the common sense when this was going through the testing process?

2524
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Like, multiple people must have worked on this project.

2525
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Where was the, I don't know, validation by a human being?

2526
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Like, was that just skipped? What happened there? How out of touch was this marketing department for real?

2527
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Dark Sakura, imagine you woke up this week and imagine you go on Facebook and you check Facebook and you say,

2528
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:44,000
hey, and you see a little thing that says Rob Roberts has put out a hit on you because you're a bitch and you smell.

2529
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
How would you have responded to that?

2530
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I'm going to cut that hooker.

2531
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Cut that bitch.

2532
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Dark Sakura apparently approved the app, ladies and gentlemen.

2533
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,000
No, I don't. No, I don't.

2534
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
He would have been like...

2535
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I would cut a bitch though.

2536
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:08,000
You would have written a ten page paragraph about what bullshit that was as your status update.

2537
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
No, I wouldn't.

2538
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I just ask people to explain certain social conventions that I find baffling.

2539
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:24,000
SSJ100Matt says, the fact that Square Enix dropped this so quickly tells me it was mostly behind their ad agency.

2540
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Yeah, I would think so.

2541
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, I'm guessing the team involved had zero women on it or the few women they had were shut out or ignored.

2542
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Now, to be fair...

2543
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
You mean like DC Comics?

2544
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:44,000
He's probably right, but just because I have to ask this because I want to know the full story.

2545
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Could I put a hit out on a man for having small tits and hairy legs?

2546
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I think you could. I don't know if they would have those options. Maybe they might, you know...

2547
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
You do have rather small boobs, Rob.

2548
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Maybe they would sort them out because of, you know, by gender and they might have different things.

2549
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
But, you know, a small penis.

2550
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Okay, right.

2551
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Maybe. I don't know.

2552
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Still not smart.

2553
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
They probably...

2554
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Don't mishear me.

2555
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Because of his large penis.

2556
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
But I'm just, you know...

2557
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I put out a hit on him because his penis is too large.

2558
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Do you know her? Her dick is so little. No.

2559
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Actually, I don't think it's even that necessarily it had zero women on it.

2560
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:36,000
It had zero people that, like, actually are in the demographic they're trying to target.

2561
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I think that's the biggest problem with things like this.

2562
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Is it's like, you know, like, you can just imagine all these old fuddy duddies sitting in a room talking about, you know, what's cool and what's hip and what the youngsters are into.

2563
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I'm hip. I'm cool.

2564
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

2565
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:58,000
And it's like, if you had shown this to anybody in that, like, you would have been told.

2566
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
It's stupid.

2567
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
It's dumb.

2568
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Quite. Rob, quite.

2569
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Alright. Moving on.

2570
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Well, good on them shutting it down as fast as they did.

2571
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
But lesson learned.

2572
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Screen that shit before it goes live.

2573
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Just saying.

2574
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
This is interesting.

2575
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Have you ever heard of a VRC6 cartridge back in the days?

2576
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
NES.

2577
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,000
VRC Memory Management Controller chip.

2578
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:33,000
It was something that Konami had on Famicom cartridges.

2579
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:38,000
It would add three extra sound channels allowing for richer audio.

2580
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Here's an example.

2581
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Here's what Castlevania 3 sounds like in the U.S. in the NES.

2582
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
We all know that one, right?

2583
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:53,000
But here's what it sounded like on the Famicom because of the three extra sound channels.

2584
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
I love this version too.

2585
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Very different, huh?

2586
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
You should hear how The Legend of Zelda sounds.

2587
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Did you know how many fucking games were dumbed down with the sound because of it?

2588
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
This is really cool.

2589
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
A chiptune artist named RussJet1.

2590
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,000
We've had his stuff on the station before. I know this guy.

2591
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:22,000
He has used the VR6 chip to remake the Mega Man 3 soundtrack.

2592
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Now, Mega Man 3 was already fucking awesome, right?

2593
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Okay, so here's an example.

2594
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Here's Magnet Man's original theme.

2595
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
This is the original.

2596
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
A good song. Remember that?

2597
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Here is RussJet1's VR6 version.

2598
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
So it's a little bit remixed too.

2599
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,000
He didn't just take the original and overlay it.

2600
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
He just completely kind of redid it.

2601
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
So that's really cool.

2602
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:17,000
He actually played through Mega Man 3 with the audio silenced,

2603
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,000
laid his tunes on top of the game footage,

2604
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
and then when he gets to Wily's Castle, it even goes through.

2605
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
So it's awesome, this whole little video that's out there.

2606
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Protoman's theme, everything is there.

2607
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:33,000
So you can check that out at RussJet1.bandcamp.com,

2608
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
where he distributes a lot of his stuff.

2609
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Very cool. Very cool.

2610
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Yeah, so, I mean, gosh, I want to go back and replay

2611
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,000
all these old games on a Famicom emulator

2612
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
just to hear how awesome the sounds were.

2613
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
You really should hear the differences between

2614
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
the different versions of The Legend of Zelda.

2615
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:54,000
It really is kind of night and day.

2616
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Well, let me open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2617
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2618
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And while we wait for some calls,

2619
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
let me see if I can bring that up here.

2620
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I think that you can find it.

2621
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I mean, it's really just the fact that

2622
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
there was a little bit different instrumentalization

2623
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
on the two different ones, so...

2624
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Let's see.

2625
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
You should look for the...

2626
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
The disc version.

2627
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Yeah, this is the disc version.

2628
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Hmm.

2629
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
It's going through the title screen and all that stuff.

2630
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Yeah.

2631
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Well, some of this sounds normal.

2632
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Oh, yeah.

2633
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I guess we have to get to, like, the dungeon.

2634
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Let me fast forward a little bit.

2635
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
But it's a lot richer.

2636
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Oh, yeah, you can even hear an extra little ding.

2637
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Let me see if we can get to the dungeon.

2638
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Here we go.

2639
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,000
You hear the difference in the start?

2640
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2641
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
You hear the difference in the start?

2642
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2643
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,000
So it's mostly...

2644
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
No, it's in the sound effects.

2645
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Oh, yeah, you can hear it in that.

2646
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:00,000
But actually, if it had allowed to play through the intro,

2647
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
it would have sounded different.

2648
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Let me go to the phones,

2649
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,000
because we're getting some calls.

2650
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2651
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Who's this?

2652
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Hi, it's Panaxium.

2653
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Hey, another video caller.

2654
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
What's up, Panaxium?

2655
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Hey.

2656
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Hi, you can't see me, but I'm waving.

2657
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
What's up?

2658
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Rob, you're a special, special person.

2659
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I know, I know.

2660
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2661
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,000
I was actually calling to see if you guys had heard of Starbound.

2662
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Starbound.

2663
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Is this like...

2664
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:28,000
This has to be like an Earthbound fan sequel, right?

2665
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Actually, no, it's the spiritual successor to Terraria.

2666
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Really?

2667
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Okay.

2668
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
No, tell me about it.

2669
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Tell me more.

2670
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,000
It's actually going to be very sci-fi.

2671
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
So you're going to be able to visit other planets and stuff,

2672
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
and each planet's going to have different ecosystems

2673
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
and monsters and things like that.

2674
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
So far, it looks like it's going to be really cool.

2675
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
I love Terraria.

2676
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I don't know if you guys had a chance to try it.

2677
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I have tried it.

2678
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I prefer Minecraft, I've got to say.

2679
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Terraria really did not tell me what to do.

2680
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I tried to get into it and could not.

2681
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Yeah, but I went back and played it after I enjoyed Minecraft,

2682
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
and I was like, all right, I see why people get into this,

2683
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,000
because it's like if Minecraft were on the Super Nintendo,

2684
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
this is what it would be.

2685
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
And that was pretty cool.

2686
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Yeah, pretty much.

2687
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
And the new ones, they have the graphics,

2688
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
they have the variety of things you can get and do

2689
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
and different races you can play as, and it seems really cool.

2690
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Is it by the same people who did the original Terraria?

2691
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Yeah, it's the same group.

2692
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
They've expanded it, though.

2693
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
There's more people working on it.

2694
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Oh, nice.

2695
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Well, I'm glad the first game worked out so well for them

2696
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
that they can actually do a sequel.

2697
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
That's got to be good.

2698
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And it actually led me to a question,

2699
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
and I thought I'd kind of pass it along to you guys

2700
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
to get your opinion.

2701
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Do you think that this will ever move from being an indie-type game

2702
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:50,000
with Minecraft and Terraria towards being a big project?

2703
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Anything's possible in this day and age.

2704
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,000
You see things like the Gianna Sisters game

2705
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
started as a project greenlight thing,

2706
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
and now it's an Xbox Live Arcade.

2707
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I suppose a lot of it is, what do the developers want?

2708
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,000
What are they kind of willing to do?

2709
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Sometimes people don't really want to play by the rules

2710
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
that systems like Xbox Live and so forth might set out.

2711
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I think we've all heard the stories before

2712
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
about the patching on Xbox Live

2713
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
and how it costs all this money

2714
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
if you want to do a patch beyond the first one,

2715
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
and it's really turned some people off.

2716
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
They won't patch Fez because of it, right?

2717
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:31,000
That's a whole big thing behind it.

2718
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Now, Nintendo's changing that up a little bit.

2719
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
We reported on that a couple weeks ago.

2720
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
We have yet to see the impact of that, if it works,

2721
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,000
but Nintendo's really trying to woo the indies towards Wii U

2722
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
by not charging a fee for any of that stuff,

2723
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:49,000
so it could be very interesting to see where they'll end up.

2724
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I guess at the end of the day, it just depends.

2725
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Do they think they can create the gaming experience

2726
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
they want on those systems?

2727
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
I don't know.

2728
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I seem to remember Terraria made pretty good use of the keyboard,

2729
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:09,000
so maybe they're worried about putting the controller into that environment.

2730
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I don't know.

2731
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
It's a risk worth taking,

2732
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:22,000
but they have to decide if financially it's one that they'll get the downloads from.

2733
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:25,000
But if the community demands it, you never know what might happen.

2734
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Yeah, exactly.

2735
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Those cooperative collaboration games

2736
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
where you're building and exploring together,

2737
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
those are my kind of game. I always liked them,

2738
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,000
so I'm hoping that they get more exposure and more games made in that style.

2739
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:41,000
That's the type of stuff that seems to really do well on Xbox Live indie games, too,

2740
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
is all the Minecraft clones.

2741
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
You look at the top games,

2742
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:48,000
half of them are Minecraft clones. It's crazy.

2743
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Yeah.

2744
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Well, that's what I had called about and just wanted to call in and say hi.

2745
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Well, hello, and thank you for alerting us to a game we ought to be keeping our eyes on.

2746
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Yeah, I'll go ahead and post the link to their website in the chat.

2747
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Awesome.

2748
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,000
All right.

2749
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy. Take care.

2750
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Panaxium, everybody, on our Skype line.

2751
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:19,000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2752
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I'm looking up Link to the Past right now.

2753
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Oh, wait. No, Link to the Past is the Super Nintendo one.

2754
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,000
That would have been different.

2755
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
What was the Adventures of Link?

2756
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
It was the second game of Link.

2757
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Live Radio, boys and girls.

2758
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Here we go.

2759
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
The Adventure of Link title.

2760
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Yeah.

2761
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Oh, wow. Even the little...

2762
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
That does...

2763
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
That sounds different, too.

2764
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,000
See, I always knew the Famicom game sounded different.

2765
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I knew about this chip and all that stuff, you know, just keeping my finger on the gaming community pulse

2766
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,000
as long as I have been.

2767
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
You knew about this stuff.

2768
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
I never really sat down and took the time to listen to some of this stuff.

2769
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
That's awesome.

2770
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Pass order.

2771
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,000
That's awesome.

2772
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2773
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
It's the one and only Rama.

2774
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Hey, Rama. What's up, buddy?

2775
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I just want you to know, for the first time in the history of calling this show,

2776
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,000
you guys have derailed me from what I wanted to talk about.

2777
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Uh-oh.

2778
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
What?

2779
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,000
RushJet1.

2780
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
After hearing that music, I went straight to the Googles.

2781
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,000
It's pretty awesome, isn't it?

2782
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
You have no idea, especially with the fact I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.

2783
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I'll be filling this up on my phone tonight.

2784
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
He's good, too.

2785
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
He's got a lot of stuff.

2786
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,000
There's a track that I think we have in rotation on VoG, actually.

2787
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,000
It was on the old Orange, because I went through the old OrangeLoungeRadio files

2788
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
and we were putting together VoG's initial playlist.

2789
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Obviously, we want a mixture of geek stuff as well as the video game stuff in there.

2790
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
But we actually had...

2791
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Oh, shit. Now that I'm talking about it, of course, I can't find it.

2792
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:08,000
But we actually had in there a track that was called...

2793
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
I think it was Konomized, was the name of the song.

2794
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
I'm going to see if I can find it while we're talking here.

2795
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
I'll play a little clip of it, but it was awesome.

2796
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:19,000
By the way, Jason also suggested finding the Hyrule Castle Famicom version from Zelda 2.

2797
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Oh, I've heard that one. It is phenomenal.

2798
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Yeah. That's pretty amazing.

2799
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I don't even like Zelda 2 that much, but I love the music in it.

2800
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Actually, Zelda 2 is my favorite one, because believe it or not, that was the first Zelda game I ever played.

2801
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Wow.

2802
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:39,000
The first one for me was the first one, but I just didn't like the side-scrolling aspect.

2803
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:44,000
I mean, I'm not going to whine because it was hard, because the game was really freaking hard.

2804
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,000
But it was just the style. It just didn't seem quite right.

2805
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:50,000
And it also looked like Link was stabbing people with his cock.

2806
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
The downward thrust.

2807
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Come on.

2808
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,000
I was in puberty. I knew what those were.

2809
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Just a second.

2810
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:05,000
So what else did you call in to talk about tonight? Just Rush Jett or...?

2811
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:09,000
No, no. I was out earlier, so I missed half the show. I apologize. I apologize.

2812
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Shame on you. It's fine. It happens.

2813
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I just want two quick things. Did you hear about what's happening to G4?

2814
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
The Esquire thing? Yeah.

2815
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:25,000
You might have missed it when we were talking about it, but another podcast, The Nerdist with Chris Hardwick,

2816
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Alan informed me that they were talking about that it's actually like Brovo, is what the network's basically going to be.

2817
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:36,000
And we were coming up with a joke, The Real Dude Bros of Orange County might be a show.

2818
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Sounds like Hipster Spike TV.

2819
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Yes. What do you think the Esquire channel will end up being?

2820
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I don't know. I don't think I want to know. It'll be funny nonetheless to see the end results.

2821
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Here's the other question. Do you care?

2822
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,000
No, not really.

2823
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Here's that song, by the way, that's in rotation on VOG. I found it.

2824
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:16,000
It's using a lot of the sound effects you hear from Konami cartridges and kind of their sound palettes, so it's pretty awesome.

2825
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Anyhow, that's Konamiized by Rush Jet, and I'm sure that's on his bandcamp site as well.

2826
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Good stuff, huh, Rama?

2827
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Oh yeah, and I found he has two albums on 8bitpeoples.com as well, so I'm definitely grabbing those.

2828
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:33,000
There you go, there you go. Alright, well, anything else on your mind tonight before I let you go, buddy?

2829
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Yes. Have you heard of a convention called MagFest?

2830
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I've heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is.

2831
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Is this about Mag the Game on Sony or no?

2832
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
No, it's a four-day gaming convention.

2833
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Oh, okay.

2834
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,000
All types of video games. And I'm checking the guest list. They have some interesting people here.

2835
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Let's just say there's somebody here where we may have to ship Dark Soccer over to DC for it.

2836
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Uh-oh.

2837
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Who's gonna pay for the ticket?

2838
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
I have my ways.

2839
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Okay, what's the talent that's gonna be there?

2840
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Well, a couple of names here we've heard on the show, like John St. John and Eric Ruth Games.

2841
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Yes, I definitely know John St. John, yep, yep.

2842
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:24,000
And since you mentioned Castlevania earlier, Kinuyo Yamashita, a composer for Castlevania.

2843
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Ooh.

2844
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Wow.

2845
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Nice.

2846
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
And, um, can I get a drumroll, please?

2847
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Yuzo Koshiro.

2848
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Nice!

2849
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Ooh.

2850
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I need to go. I'm a huge Yuzo Koshiro fan. That's awesome.

2851
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Well, we have one spot left in our room.

2852
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
When is it?

2853
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
First weekend of January.

2854
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Oh, that's like really soon. Oh my God.

2855
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:59,000
I can't do anything that weekend, because that's when my coworker is already out, so I can't take the same time off.

2856
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Well, that's okay, because my crew, we're gonna take care of you guys at MAGFest, so we are in line for press.

2857
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Awesome. SSG100Matt says MAGFest is amazing. Brental Floss has been there the last few years.

2858
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Yes, and also they also call this con drink fest. I don't think I have to explain why.

2859
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Can't imagine why.

2860
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Well, there's a reason why they're walking around with styrofoam containers.

2861
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Hopefully I make it out there for PAX East. We'll see. I'm still trying. I have to wait for them to open up the media registration to see if, you know, we can make that work.

2862
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Well, my entire staff, we got our badges in advance, then we're gonna apply for press, and if we get pressed, then we'll just pass the badges on to somebody else or whoever.

2863
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
There you go. There you go. Paying it forward.

2864
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Got that shit right.

2865
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Alright. Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls.

2866
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Take care, man.

2867
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Alright, take care, buddy. Have fun at MAGFest.

2868
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Will do.

2869
02:38:51,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Yep. Yeah, and I've basically been told that basically, yes, I am being forced at gunpoint to go to Dragon Con next year, so that's like a thing.

2870
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
I've been told if you want to go to PAX, you better go to PAX East, because you ain't going to PAX Prime.

2871
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Alright. Yes, sir.

2872
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,000
1877 GameOLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2873
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:19,000
So, yeah, if you're in the southeast part of the country, you might want to make plans on Dragon Con, because there's like a lot of vog stuff going on at Dragon Con next year.

2874
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,000
That's all I can really say.

2875
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:26,000
OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, 1877 GameOLR.

2876
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Loki, I can go to you for last minute stories, but I can also do the Twitter topics.

2877
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
I've got last minute stories if you want them.

2878
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Yeah, go for it.

2879
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to the PlayStation Network probably next week.

2880
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:49,000
It's dated for December 12th in Hong Kong, I believe. It's the English version there.

2881
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:58,000
However, it has been also confirmed on the Drop, which is the PlayStation Blog's little bit where they talk about stuff that's coming out.

2882
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:02,000
And next week, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas PS2 Classic.

2883
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:05,000
So, fantastic that that's going to be coming out.

2884
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Also, there's been some Linux system requirements popping up on Steam for some games that haven't really been announced yet.

2885
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Serious Sam BFE's Linux requirements have been on there, and also some more of the, I guess, a few Greenlight games as well.

2886
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:31,000
So, perhaps more evidence that they're really working towards that Steam version, or the Linux version of Steam for the Steam Box.

2887
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Be interesting. And then finally, the next Assassin's Creed is going to be in Brazil.

2888
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:48,000
And this has been actually confirmed, I guess GameSpot says they verified the translation that the next chapter is supposed to be held in Brazil.

2889
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:51,000
And this was coming from Ubisoft Brazil.

2890
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Imagine that.

2891
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Yes, that their next game is going to be there.

2892
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Obviously it'd be perfect for them to be working on it in some, you know, capacity.

2893
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
That's it.

2894
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Going to some Twitter topics.

2895
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Oh, sorry. One last thing real quick.

2896
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Again, 1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype.

2897
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:20,000
As I mentioned on my Twitter this week, I am very disappointed to announce that Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable has been cancelled in the US.

2898
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,000
At least the retail release of it.

2899
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Now, that doesn't rule out that they could be doing a digital only version, which would make sense.

2900
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Because the Vita not doing so great, and a game that's kind of niched like Earth Defense Force may not sell very well as far as releasing it retail.

2901
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:43,000
DJ Max Technica just came out on Vita this week, and it's apparently easier to get on the digital store than it is to get a physical copy.

2902
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:48,000
I don't, yeah. So, that might be why.

2903
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
So, let's go to the phones, because you do have a call coming in.

2904
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2905
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Hey, this is Raginator.

2906
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Hey, Raginator. And look, another video.

2907
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I like that the callers are actually listening to the request for more video.

2908
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
What's up, buddy?

2909
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
No, not too much.

2910
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I just have a couple of questions for you.

2911
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Sure.

2912
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:20,000
First off, I know that ROMs are kind of a legal gray area.

2913
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:32,000
But in terms of the emulators, assuming that you have, let's say, Final Fantasy XII for the PS2, you actually own the game.

2914
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Are you allowed to use an emulator to play the game?

2915
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:44,000
You're right. It's a gray area. And I'm gonna say up front, I am not a lawyer, so do not take legal advice from me.

2916
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:50,000
But my understanding is, you are entitled to make your own backup copy of a game that you own.

2917
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:58,000
So, if you make your own backup copy, and you use an emulator to play that backup copy, I believe you're okay.

2918
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:04,000
However, if you downloaded said copy from the internet, technically that's where you're in the legal gray area.

2919
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Are you gonna end up on Judge Judy and spend time behind bars because of it? Probably not. Probably not.

2920
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:20,000
But are you being 100% legal? You're a law-abiding citizen by every step of the way? Probably not.

2921
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:28,000
But I think ethically, if you wanna ask the ethical question, if you own the game, then yes.

2922
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:34,000
You should be able to have the emulator and do whatever crazy things you wanna do with the hacking and the so forth.

2923
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:40,000
You paid your money to support the developers and get the game and so forth. Have at you. Do what you want with it.

2924
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I think ethically, you're okay.

2925
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Yeah. I mean, I brought it up because I still have a lot of games on disk.

2926
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I got a way around. Luckily, the things back in August did not scale everything.

2927
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I still got my Final Fantasy trial and I've been dying to beat the game.

2928
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:02,000
That is the GameStop collector's edition too. I can even tell because it's the same one I have.

2929
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
The tin box? Yeah, I have that one too.

2930
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:07,000
You can tell. That's what video allows me to do.

2931
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I've played it once.

2932
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
It's a good game. It really is.

2933
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:20,000
BlackWolf wanted to add to this conversation. He says it all depends on if you had to circumvent copy protection to make that ROM playable on the emulator.

2934
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:29,000
That's a DMCA violation. But again, legally, yeah, but ethically, I think you're okay.

2935
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Yeah, I just kind of figured if there was something out there that a program did, well, it mimicked the hardware.

2936
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:45,000
If I actually popped the disk into my computer's DVD drive, the original disk, basically turned my computer into a PS2,

2937
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I wasn't totally sure if it would be legal or not, so I don't want to get myself into trouble.

2938
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I think you'll be fine. Nobody listens to this show. That's the good news.

2939
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:03,000
On the PlayStation 2, didn't you have that hard drive backup thing where you could load all the games to the drive and play them off the drive and it worked fine?

2940
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Yeah, it was...

2941
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,000
No, not you. I'm sorry. That was Loki, not you, Reginator. Sorry.

2942
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Yeah, there was the HD loader that they had.

2943
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Yeah, the HD loader. And, you know, if it's games you own, that's fine.

2944
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:19,000
But if you're renting games, dumping them and then shipping them back, that's ethically shame, shame, slap on the wrist.

2945
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Yeah.

2946
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
So, anyway, sorry, Reginator.

2947
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Yeah, well, I don't see, at least with what you were just talking about, you know, even then, how many games are going to put onto that PS2 hard drive?

2948
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:46,000
It was only a 60 gigabyte hard drive, or scratch it out, 40 gigabytes, and the average PS2 game was about, let's say, no more than 8 gigs, so...

2949
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:54,000
That's where you hack things to get the 500 gig hard drive to work, which you can also do on the Wii.

2950
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Now, one thing I kind of touched on over the past month or two is that now that I don't have any consoles anymore, thanks to thieves, I've been getting into PC games.

2951
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:23,000
And, you know, at least temporarily I've been using games for Windows Live in the marketplace, if only because I have a pre-existing account through Microsoft when I have my 360.

2952
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Sure.

2953
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Now, and I noticed that compared to, say, Xbox Live in their marketplace, there's hardly any, for lack of a better term, meaty games, like, let's say, the duels of playing Spockers games.

2954
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:47,000
There's no Geometry Wars, no...

2955
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
That's why it failed, sir.

2956
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:52,000
That's why it unfortunately has failed.

2957
02:46:52,000 --> 02:47:02,000
And, unfortunately, what you see there is probably all that's gonna be there, because now it's all about the Windows 8 marketplace is where the future focus is gonna be.

2958
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I think games for Windows is sadly a thing of the past.

2959
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I could be wrong, you never know.

2960
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:15,000
I mean, if people will buy it, maybe they'll still put it there, but I think they're moving on to this whole Windows 8 marketplace is the future.

2961
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Sucks for those of us that are always a generation or two behind, just because that's where we have to be, right?

2962
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Yeah, now, that being said, right now my computer has Windows 7 Home Premium installed, and now, would you recommend, based on what you know about Windows 8, would you recommend that upgrade to Windows 8 or stick with 7 Premium?

2963
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:49,000
I haven't used it, so it's hard for me to say. I couldn't say, yes, you should upgrade, but I'm not using it myself.

2964
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:56,000
I will tell you my hesitation is that I want to see how the compatibility looks with Windows 8 and kind of what the complaints are about it.

2965
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Also, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

2966
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Yeah. Most of my friends that are using it, this is kind of the bottom line that I've heard from people that are using it right now.

2967
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:19,000
If you're on something before 7, then upgrade, but if you're on 7, eh, there's a few little perks, but it's not something you gotta get right now. It can wait.

2968
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Alright. Sounds good.

2969
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Alright, Rachel, I gotta let you go so we can wrap things up, but thank you so much for the call, and thank you for the video.

2970
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Sure, no problem.

2971
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Alright, take care, buddy.

2972
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Alright, bye-bye.

2973
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Bye.

2974
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

2975
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Thank you to all our callers for calling it.

2976
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:40,000
You know, now that we have the router and that the stream's not dropping, I think we need to get a studio cam back.

2977
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
I think that might be something we need to do.

2978
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
That way we can look at the listeners when they're calling.

2979
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Alright, um, that is not gonna do it just yet, because I need to get to the Twitter topics, but that is gonna do it for the Skype line.

2980
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
If you didn't get through, email us.

2981
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2982
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Retertainment tweeted us earlier and said,

2983
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:02,000
O-L-R, the Grammys ended with an award.

2984
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
The Emmys ended with an award.

2985
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
The Oscars ended an award.

2986
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:10,000
The VGAs ended with Tenacious D.

2987
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
What the fuck?

2988
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
I'd say that's a good ending.

2989
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Unpopular opinion time.

2990
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:19,000
I think Tenacious D is super overrated.

2991
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
I don't think they're that good.

2992
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,000
That's...

2993
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
I caused Jamie to choke, yay!

2994
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
No, the latke caused me to choke.

2995
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,000
I know that's unpopular opinion, I'll get hate mail, I just...

2996
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:33,000
For the record, when you reheat the latkes, do it on the stove.

2997
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Poor Jamie. Do you gonna be alright?

2998
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Do you water?

2999
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Okay.

3000
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:47,000
I don't need an ambulance to interrupt episode of Orange Lounge Radio either.

3001
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
We haven't had evacuation, we haven't had an ambulance.

3002
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
She's putting the hack in Hanukkah.

3003
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Alright, let's see, Tigerclaw sent us a story lead here.

3004
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Bronies shut down their My Little Pony MMO, blaming copyright law.

3005
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:08,000
You know what got shut down today, actually?

3006
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,000
What?

3007
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Two of the largest indexers for Usenet.

3008
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Do people still use Usenet?

3009
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:19,000
For any legitimate purpose whatsoever?

3010
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

3011
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Hence why those sites are getting shut down.

3012
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,000
It's legit.

3013
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I remember when Usenet was like, actually a...

3014
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:32,000
It's legit. I mean, there's totally not pirated stuff on there.

3015
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:36,000
But yeah, NZB Matrix and NZB...

3016
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Or Newsbin 2 got shut down.

3017
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Alright, so, back to the Brony story.

3018
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Some Brony developers were putting together My Little Pony online,

3019
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,000
but a cease and desist came in from Hasbro,

3020
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
but they pressed ahead.

3021
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:54,000
They said, screw it, and they moved forward,

3022
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:57,000
and they released the game's first episode a month ago.

3023
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:04,000
However, Hasbro's lawyers sent down a shutdown demand to HLP online.

3024
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:08,000
The team put out a statement, it's very carefully worded,

3025
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,000
not blaming Hasbro through the shutdown.

3026
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Quote, Hasbro is not to be blamed here, they wrote.

3027
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,000
As per US trademark law,

3028
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
as soon as an infringement comes to light,

3029
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:22,000
they are obligated to defend the trademark or they will lose it.

3030
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:26,000
They had no choice in the matter, regardless of what they thought the project

3031
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
or how it benefited them.

3032
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
There was little we could do to work around it.

3033
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Discussions continued through the month, but it came down to one fact.

3034
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:36,000
MLP online had to come to an end.

3035
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:39,000
So it's that whole... You know, we've heard this a couple times this year.

3036
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
I remember the whole gamer thing.

3037
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Remember when Reddit got su...

3038
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Not sued yet, but the cease and desist went to Reddit over the gamer thing,

3039
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:52,000
where gamer.org had it, and then they said that Reddit had to stop using it.

3040
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I don't know if that's really been resolved yet,

3041
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,000
but the guy was like, hey, I have a trademark and I have to protect it.

3042
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:01,000
And a lot of people are like, why were you given that trademark in the first place?

3043
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Now, this is a little different because we can all understand

3044
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:08,000
why Hasbro has a trademark on My Little Pony, but...

3045
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Rama in chat, I know one of our resident bronies says,

3046
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:19,000
I'm surprised that Hasbro sent a C&D due to all the episodes floating around on YouTube.

3047
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Well, if Hasbro gets the magic button, those will all disappear real fast.

3048
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:26,000
And the people just talking about it.

3049
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Are there Watch Me Get High and Watch My Little Pony videos on YouTube?

3050
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Like, reaction videos?

3051
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
I'm sure there are.

3052
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Jeez.

3053
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Never choke on a lot, good people.

3054
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Tigerclaw tweets us to an article about times lists of the year, gadget of the year.

3055
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
The Wii U, second place.

3056
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
First place for gadget of the year?

3057
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Loki, you're gonna love this.

3058
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
iPhone 5.

3059
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Times gadget of the year.

3060
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Those are tweets from Tigerclaw.

3061
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Lastly, from SSJ100, Matt.

3062
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:07,000
People say Lego City Undercover is like Lego Grand Theft Auto,

3063
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:12,000
but someone made a Lego version of the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer,

3064
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:13,000
and he links us to it. Have you seen this?

3065
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:14,000
I saw it, yeah.

3066
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:15,000
What'd you think?

3067
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:19,000
It was kind of disappointing because it was the first trailer and not the second one,

3068
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
because the second one would have been really cool.

3069
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:24,000
But I mean, obviously that stop motion stuff takes a long time, so it's so cool.

3070
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:25,000
But yeah.

3071
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:31,000
But yes, Lego City Undercover, I swear to God, was at one time being worked on by Rockstar

3072
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:34,000
because you see that first screenshot that they had?

3073
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Same fucking HUD, same, like, everything as Grand Theft Auto.

3074
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:43,000
So I wouldn't be surprised at one time that that was the thing that Rockstar was working on with them,

3075
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:46,000
but now it's, you know, Traveler Tales or whatever.

3076
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Whoever's putting it in, I think it's Traveler Tales.

3077
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:49,000
When is that coming out?

3078
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
I don't think they have it.

3079
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
It's supposed to be launch window, so in the next three months?

3080
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Could be anything.

3081
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Fuck, I mean, seriously, was it Wii Fit U now is the first half of next year instead of launch window?

3082
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:03,000
And the rest of us all March.

3083
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I mean, that, see, right there, that would have been probably the only, like, if I were to pick up a Wii U,

3084
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:14,000
that would be the game I'd probably get, is that Lego City Undercover, because it actually looks pretty awesome.

3085
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:19,000
But that's really the only game that's been kind of impressive to me, is just that one.

3086
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Sorry for the dead air, I was just catching up on chat there.

3087
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
That is actually going to do it.

3088
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,000
That was it for Twitter Topics.

3089
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
You said you were done with Last Minute Stories, right?

3090
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:31,000
I believe I am.

3091
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:35,000
So that brings us to a close of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3092
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Sad.

3093
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:42,000
So, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we close up shop tonight.

3094
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:48,000
And my final thought, I'll start tonight, my final thought is F you to Jelly Beans, they're addicting too.

3095
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

3096
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
What, guys?

3097
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
And Loki, your final thought tonight?

3098
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Check out the VoG Minecraft server if you haven't yet.

3099
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:04,000
There's information in our forums on how to sign up, basically just say, hey, I want to sign up,

3100
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:07,000
put your username on there, and I add you to the white list.

3101
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Because now we have, you know, Mob Arena, it's kind of fun just to battle monsters, and it's really fucking hard.

3102
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,000
So, definitely worth trying it.

3103
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:21,000
And just because I want to see more than, like, one person on there at a time, because it's pretty sad.

3104
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,000
There's, like, it's a ghost town, so we need more people on there.

3105
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
And I don't know how to get more people to come.

3106
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
You need to plan a night.

3107
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,000
I know, I know.

3108
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:34,000
I'm here, and everybody converge this night.

3109
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,000
And I will try to drop in if it's not like when we take the courthouse or something.

3110
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Well, I think if I get the mob, because I'm still working on the Mob Arena stuff,

3111
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:47,000
I think once I get that done, or it's actually, you know, somewhat, they have some usable classes,

3112
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:51,000
because we're still tweaking the classes, because some of them don't make any sense or don't work right.

3113
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:55,000
So, once I'm done tweaking that and the waves and stuff like that,

3114
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:58,000
because we had a problem at one time where it was just creepers spawning.

3115
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:04,000
It was just tons of fucking creepers, and, like, literally you would see, you'd be watching the, you know,

3116
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,000
up top, and I'd have, like, they have different waves.

3117
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:12,000
They have one called a swarm wave, and all the creatures spawn one heart worth of health, but it's a ton of them.

3118
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:17,000
So, all of a sudden we saw, like, 30 creepers just, like, poof, just spawned.

3119
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:21,000
It was like, holy shit, there's a huge wave of creepers chasing after me.

3120
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:24,000
So, it was kind of fun. But, yeah.

3121
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:28,000
All right. Black Wolf says, we also need a Forza Horizon Knight.

3122
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:32,000
I'll be down for that. That's on my queue for Game Rental games, so I need to send Silent Hill back,

3123
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
because I'm probably not going to play much more of it.

3124
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:37,000
I need to check out that game, because I need to use a game for my, uh, I have my steering wheel.

3125
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
That would be fun to mess around with.

3126
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
You know what game I have sitting here, waiting to play?

3127
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:44,000
I haven't, I didn't get around to it for this week, but for next week, on the PS3.

3128
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:50,000
XCOM, I have from the Rental guys waiting to play, so, excited to check that out.

3129
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I want the best PC game this year from, uh, I don't, I mean, I'm kind of surprised.

3130
02:56:55,000 --> 02:57:01,000
I was, um, spending, uh, Thanksgiving with, um, Spike from Game Buoy, if any of you listen to that show.

3131
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Which, if you don't, you should. They're a fun duo there.

3132
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:08,000
But, uh, Spike was showing me XCOM on PC, and I played, like, a round of it,

3133
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:14,000
and, uh, it was fun. So, I, I put the game in my Rental queue.

3134
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
There you go. And now I have it.

3135
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Alright, um, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3136
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show.

3137
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Thank you for supporting independent, you guys are already packing up,

3138
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
and have one foot out the door, and I haven't even rolled credits yet.

3139
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
I'm going to drive home. You're home already.

3140
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
No, no. I have to get out.

3141
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
My, um, my, uh, mouse died.

3142
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Oh, that sucks. Alright.

3143
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.

3144
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
If you like what you hear, please spread the word.

3145
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Tell a friend or two about Orange Launch Radio,

3146
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:46,000
and, uh, help spread the word of independent podcasting.

3147
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
You know, if you've listened to this episode and you've thought,

3148
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:51,000
eh, it sucks, at least support other independent podcasters.

3149
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:54,000
There's so many people out there that work hard to, uh, put this out there.

3150
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,000
If you think it sucks, the more stars you give us,

3151
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
it means the worse you think the show is.

3152
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Uh, yes, give us nice reviews on iTunes, please.

3153
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Uh, and, uh, you know, wherever you found this podcast.

3154
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Help us spread the word and, uh, yeah, that's all we ask.

3155
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Um, enjoy the world while it's still here, guys.

3156
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
We'll see you next week to do it all again.

3157
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,000
No, no, no. The apocalypse.
