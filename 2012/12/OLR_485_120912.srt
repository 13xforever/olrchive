00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:25,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, December 9th, 2012, the Wii U is set to get a Google app, Nintendo blocks mature content during the day in one region, and could Idolmaster finally see a localized release?

2
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:36,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:45,674
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 485 of our show for this December 9th, 2012.

4
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:53,599
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and gaming lols with my co-hosts.

5
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,559
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

6
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:25,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, and I gave everybody Hanukkah presents.

7
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:27,356
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say Mazel Tov!

8
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:28,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It was delicious.

9
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:33,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew that Rob loves coffee, so I gave him and Alan a bunch of coffee.

10
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:34,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan loves coffee too, that's important.

11
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:37,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was like, what would they both like?

12
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got them crap tons of Keurig stuff.

13
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:45,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got our other person in the room gift cards.

14
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:46,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Who I should introduce.

15
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:47,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Including a Burger King gift card.

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

17
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:50,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and thank you for that.

18
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:51,303
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

19
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:52,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm due by proxy, so.

20
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I give everyone Hanukkah cards.

21
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:56,107
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

22
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:02,633
[SPEAKER_08]: You, you, okay, DarkSakura converted to Judaism, you know, Loki married a Jew.

23
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't, what's my connection?

24
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:05,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I have friends that are Jewish.

25
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,618
[SPEAKER_08]: The last girl I ever dated was Jewish.

26
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:10,680
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I lived with John.

28
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,603
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not really Jewish.

29
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:14,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he's not.

30
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:16,405
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's why I call him kinda Jew-y.

31
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:18,307
[SPEAKER_11]: You know.

32
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:21,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do mean it.

33
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I like all sorts of people that I've met in my life.

34
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And you like their food.

35
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:29,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I've ever met a Jewish person I didn't really truly like, honestly.

36
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:34,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Now everybody's going to be like, oh, that's a challenge.

37
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me introduce you to the worst person I know.

38
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:37,183
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

39
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:39,985
[SPEAKER_11]: We're now about two weeks away from the alpacalypse.

40
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:49,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, the whole Mayan calendar No, the alpacalypse, when the woolly, long-necked creatures of the world will come and trample us all Is that a Weird Al song?

41
00:02:50,166 --> 00:03:06,271
[SPEAKER_11]: No Oh, it should be I thought that was his album, was Alpacalypse Well yeah, but no, it was Alpacalypse But no, there's a thing where they're showing pictures of alpacas and they're saying so many days to the alpacalypse I've been laughing, so I want to have an alpaca party

42
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:12,274
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, all I have to say is that how many times have they predicted the end of the world and it didn't happen?

43
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:14,576
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just one more to put in there.

44
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:15,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

45
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:21,541
[SPEAKER_08]: When NASA has to come out and say, stop being depressed, the world is not going to end.

46
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Your move next, world.

47
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:29,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, how are you, Tech Master Loki, in non-Armageddon news?

48
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:29,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

49
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:35,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been constantly entering stuff on SteamGifts.com and obviously not winning anything.

50
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:36,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what is this?

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,504
[SPEAKER_06]: SteamGifts.com is basically a site you sign up for.

52
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,646
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens is people give away Steam codes on there.

53
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:43,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So you enter raffles.

54
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:48,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And so every time that someone puts a code up there, you get 5% of the points that that code's worth.

55
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:54,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So each dollar, say it's a $5 code, it's five points.

56
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,758
[SPEAKER_06]: You would get one point in your account.

57
00:03:56,198 --> 00:04:05,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, I went in there earlier and I had 180-some, and so I kept, you know, enter to win, enter to win all these things, and then you come back a few days later, oh, I got more points!

58
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:23,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you just keep entering stuff in there, and you can, you know, put your own stuff up there if you want, and then they'll give you contributing dollars in which you can go to certain ones they have locked out, okay, you have to have contributed $5 worth of Steam Codes to enter this drawing, and it's a little easier to win because it's going to be more exclusive.

59
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just do that.

60
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:28,008
[SPEAKER_06]: But since it's free, I figured why not?

61
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might win something.

62
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:31,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, in this case, not.

63
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You might win spam email.

64
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Fill in your box.

65
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:50,177
[SPEAKER_08]: We always have the ever-present fourth guest on our show at the chatroom, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live, as we have for the past coming up on 11 years, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

66
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:52,478
[SPEAKER_08]: That's vognetwork.com.

67
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:59,060
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show each and every single Sunday night.

68
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And Actdeft in our chatroom tonight says SteamGifts.com where nobody ever wins anything.

69
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:05,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, somebody does.

70
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,302
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it's very rare.

71
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:09,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better chances in the lottery.

72
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:13,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft does follow that up with I only won one game in like a thousand entries.

73
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:15,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was one game.

74
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:16,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Still better odds in the lottery.

75
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:18,885
[SPEAKER_08]: It's better than Loki's done out of that apparently.

76
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:23,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I want to promote something.

77
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:23,917
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

78
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:24,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

79
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:25,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you about it earlier.

80
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,379
[SPEAKER_10]: My new Tumblr.

81
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:28,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

82
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:29,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not the Tumbles?

83
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:32,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because I want people to give me suggestions.

84
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:42,114
[SPEAKER_11]: My Tumblr is masseffecting.tumblr.com and I'm doing this series called Lol Effect where I'm doing just all captions on Mass Effect screencaps and I want people to participate.

85
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,557
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think of a good one, make it and send it to me and I will post it.

86
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:49,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think maybe everybody's burned out on that by now because you talk about it every week?

87
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:57,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what I'm getting on Twitter right now is I need to shut up about the series because I'm ruining it by talking about it so much.

88
00:05:57,282 --> 00:05:57,482
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

89
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:58,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

90
00:05:58,202 --> 00:05:58,402
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

91
00:05:58,963 --> 00:05:59,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Dearest.

92
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:20,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, again, live.vognetwork.com Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth What I wanted to talk about tonight was the VGAs, which of course happened on Friday night And I don't think any of us watched, well that's not true, Jamie, you saw bits and pieces of it it sounds like

93
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was... Okay.

94
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw this gift set go... I wasn't going to watch it all.

95
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:33,113
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I saw this gift set go up on my Tumblr feed that was all like BroShep and FemShep playing multiplayer with Garrus.

96
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:35,094
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, okay, that's funny.

97
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:38,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I found that the whole VGAs were streamed.

98
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,816
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went looking through the stream to try to find it.

99
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:42,456
[SPEAKER_11]: And I ended up watching bits and pieces of it.

100
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the Halo 4 thing was pretty funny.

101
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:48,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I found the Mass Effect thing and I stopped caring about everything else.

102
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:49,979
[SPEAKER_11]: I did watch the Claptrap one.

103
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:50,979
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty funny.

104
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,222
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the little blips for best character of the year.

105
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:59,264
[SPEAKER_11]: The Claptrap one was funny, I must admit, but no.

106
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:02,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Shepard was robbed, both of them.

107
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:11,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to try to talk about or evaluate a show I didn't watch, but just listening to Bobby, because he is before us every Sunday night at VOG Network.

108
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:12,252
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

109
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying anything bad about the game.

110
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played it, so I know no good or bad.

111
00:07:36,177 --> 00:07:45,422
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know a lot of people really love it, and it has nothing to do with the OMG Zombies part of it, but just I guess the storytelling in the game is so good.

112
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:56,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And you had another game that was kind of similar in some ways, Journey, which is one of those kind of very difficult to explain to somebody why it's so good, but it's that whole emotional connection.

113
00:07:56,587 --> 00:07:57,008
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like...

114
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:01,610
[SPEAKER_08]: and Journey probably won, what, the second most awards besides Walking Dead.

115
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So emotion really seemed to connect with the audience this year.

116
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,354
[SPEAKER_08]: The big bro games, like, what would be the bro games?

117
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:13,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo 4, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, to some extent even Mass Effect, Jamie.

118
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:16,278
[SPEAKER_08]: None of those games really got the same type of recognition this year.

119
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:17,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Best RPG, hello!

120
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:47,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the choice of the awards this year and the way it's all presented mean that they're taking this more seriously?

121
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:49,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts?

122
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:50,973
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

123
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:52,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm yelling at Dan in chat room.

124
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan is in chat.

125
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:54,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dear.

126
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:57,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that they need to have Samuel L. Jackson hosted each year because he's pretty funny.

127
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they've been doing that.

128
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's only hosted four times out of ten years, so...

129
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:05,683
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

130
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:25,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it looked familiar.

131
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:26,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, somebody from Walking Dead.

132
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:27,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

133
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:34,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, again, I can't evaluate a game I have not played, so I have nothing good nor bad, but I hear a lot of good things.

134
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,194
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will play it before the end of the year.

135
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:37,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Muir wasn't nominated, was he?

136
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:38,776
[SPEAKER_08]: He wasn't even nominated, no.

137
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:40,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because he wasn't all that great.

138
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:41,018
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

139
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,720
[SPEAKER_08]: He's fine.

140
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,201
[SPEAKER_08]: He's fine.

141
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,796
[SPEAKER_11]: and her Carol Danvers makes me a little, you know, warm.

142
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:03,656
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

143
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:04,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

144
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,597
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatter's filling in the gap there.

145
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:09,879
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Clementine from The Walking Dead, Melissa Hutchinson.

146
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:11,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she's not bad.

147
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:20,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even, again, I haven't played the game, but I recognize that name as one that people talk a lot about on Twitter, so I can clearly see that, okay, you know.

148
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,343
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

149
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:56,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And just so you know, the best human male voice was Damian Clark from Borderlands 2 or Handsome Jack.

150
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:57,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's awesome.

151
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the little bits and pieces I've heard.

152
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

153
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:03,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

154
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:06,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't the male award seem to go to villains more often than heroes?

155
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:15,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't, oh my God, Mark Hamill, thank you, win the award for the Joker last year?

156
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:15,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

157
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Campbell's awesome.

158
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,400
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also the last time he's voicing the Joker.

159
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you give him more money.

160
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:22,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I doubt it.

161
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:32,008
[SPEAKER_11]: You think about people having to do a voice like that that's so different from their regular voice, it's going to actually take a physical toll on someone.

162
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:40,534
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have to do another Arkham game at some point, though, so it'll be interesting to see how they frame it.

163
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:44,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else on the VGAs anyone wishes to comment on?

164
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,150
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to watch that clip.

165
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,870
[SPEAKER_11]: It was hilarious.

166
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take a look at some point.

167
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:49,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Lance, too.

168
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:54,915
[SPEAKER_11]: And if anybody wants to see it, it's on my Tumblr, MassAffecting.Tumblr.com Plug, plug, cheap plug.

169
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:58,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, the reason is because Viacom blocked it on YouTube.

170
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunstar in our chat room, who could that be?

171
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,020
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Dan.

172
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,624
[SPEAKER_08]: No doubt commenting on the awards I was just talking about says, Evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

173
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Well put.

174
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:17,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, my hubby is awesome because he said Garrus does sound like a boss, though.

175
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:25,928
[SPEAKER_11]: His voice actor is kind of a goofy-looking guy, and if you ever watched the episode of Buffy he was in, his awesome voice does not suit his face.

176
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:33,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It is kind of nice when your significant other will make a concession towards your fandom, isn't it?

177
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:36,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Has Nellie ever made any concessions towards your fandoms, Loki?

178
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,619
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we had a discussion today about, like...

179
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, so what exactly, you know, what do you think?

180
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, garbage.

181
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:47,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, my point exactly.

182
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:52,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in the case of Alan and I, we really do like a lot of the same stuff.

183
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he's way more into Half-Life than I am, but I don't, like, dislike it at all.

184
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:02,457
[SPEAKER_08]: When I played it, it was, you know, the little bits I have played, I've enjoyed.

185
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:06,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I just haven't sat down and played the whole thing, so we don't really have...

186
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,081
[SPEAKER_08]: That same conflict.

187
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:09,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's something.

188
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:10,442
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something I'm not thinking of.

189
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:12,563
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

190
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:17,685
[SPEAKER_08]: My Rocky Horror thing and my cult movie thing, he's been a good sport about coming out to see those and support that.

191
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:21,287
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always nice when you're seeing if another will buy into fandoms and so forth.

192
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:28,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I guess let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.

193
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:35,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragenator in chat says, what are the odds of Mass Effect and Garrus winning every award if DarkSakura hosted an award show?

194
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:36,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up, don't judge me.

195
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:37,905
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why we don't host one.

196
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:38,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't judge me.

197
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,048
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

198
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,140
[SPEAKER_11]: and Fairy Solitaire.

199
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:06,263
[SPEAKER_08]: God, that game is awful.

200
00:14:06,423 --> 00:14:07,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

201
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:10,430
[SPEAKER_08]: For the past three weeks in a row, you've talked about your Fairy Solitaire.

202
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,974
[SPEAKER_08]: You keep saying it's awful, but it's clearly not.

203
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,911
[SPEAKER_11]: It's stupidly addicting.

204
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:18,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like playing on... Remember back in the day when Neopets was big?

205
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:21,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that was awful.

206
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:24,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you remember the stupid card games on Neopets?

207
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

208
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were kind of addicting?

209
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:28,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Neopets still around?

210
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:29,244
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to be still around.

211
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:29,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll check.

212
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:31,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if I still have my damn account.

213
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they sell Neopets shit at Claire's for some time?

214
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:34,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they did.

215
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:35,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

216
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever walk into a Claire's just to buy Neopets stuff?

217
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:38,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Be honest.

218
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:40,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone that we both know has.

219
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:40,994
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

220
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:44,417
[SPEAKER_11]: who hosts another show.

221
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:45,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, okay.

222
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:46,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

223
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:47,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a witness to this.

224
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,259
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

225
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't judge.

226
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't judge.

227
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:50,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I can judge.

228
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:54,203
[SPEAKER_08]: People have bought World of Warcraft cards.

229
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:55,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't judge.

230
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:57,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone bought a Mass Effect 2 deck of cards.

231
00:14:58,186 --> 00:14:59,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And, wow.

232
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:00,107
[SPEAKER_08]: You?

233
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:00,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

234
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:03,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And, wow, lo and behold, the Joker card was Joker.

235
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:04,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody has their thing.

236
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:12,099
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I have not turned into a My Little Pony fan because there is nothing that is awesome as the old one.

237
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:14,001
[SPEAKER_11]: The old one kicked ass.

238
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,362
[SPEAKER_11]: The new one is stupid.

239
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm judging you all.

240
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:21,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for your week besides Mass Effect and Very Solitaire?

241
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:30,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched Dan play Sega Racing Classic and he put it in karaoke mode and started singing Let's Fry Sky High.

242
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:34,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's Cousin's Daughter

243
00:15:53,534 --> 00:16:11,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I wasn't there I was hanging with Becky that night I assumed you were, my bad I was out on a booze buying spree Lots of Bailey's and Hypnotic and Kahlua and Sake And then Becky dyed my hair and then we made fun of people

244
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:12,965
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

245
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't listen to her.

246
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:34,791
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

247
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:37,332
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

248
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:38,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

249
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:39,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl.

250
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:41,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about a different game.

251
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:44,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Far Cry 3 this week.

252
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, a little bit more in the campaign.

253
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's fantastic.

254
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hunting dingoes last night.

255
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:53,202
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be no baby eating in my launch.

256
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:55,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.

257
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:56,524
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I do?

258
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:56,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

259
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:01,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

260
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:15,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

261
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:38,923
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

262
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:04,452
[SPEAKER_06]: The number of players plus one times 40 for Psycho.

263
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So this thing had like 16,000 hearts of health.

264
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:11,259
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were literally beating it with a stick for...

265
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say 20 minutes and it still wasn't dead.

266
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:19,083
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like, okay, I think this is a little too powerful.

267
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:20,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to tweak all that stuff.

268
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a bunch of cool classes in there.

269
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,926
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend wanted me to make a pimp class, so I made a pimp class.

270
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,667
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a pimp stick that you can beat things with.

271
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:33,789
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your variety of hoes that you can use that have different abilities.

272
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,291
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because the game has hoes in it.

273
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else?

274
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:42,937
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Wolfmaster that you have wolves that attack things.

275
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:46,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a miner class.

276
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:52,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a class that's like a golem class that you can build iron golems with.

277
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:53,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Although...

278
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:58,549
[SPEAKER_06]: No wait, I had that class, but then the Iron Golems did no damage to anything, so I had to remove that.

279
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:03,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninjas, you know, lots of fun stuff, but it gets hard.

280
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:08,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, it's insanely hard, but it's kind of fun.

281
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:13,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm still balancing that stuff, probably working on that a little bit this week, but some good times so far.

282
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:19,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And hit stun in chat at live.vognetwork.com wants to know, are we getting world edit back?

283
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:23,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sorry, I've been messing with the permission stuff.

284
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:27,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you will have world edit back soon, as soon as I fix that.

285
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:34,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I took everything out to figure out why the mob arena wasn't working, and...

286
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:45,711
[SPEAKER_06]: in the process I kind of removed some of the permissions I may put it back to the permissions bucket the way I had it before because B permissions is kind of weird so I'll fix that again

287
00:19:48,061 --> 00:20:14,544
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Call of Duty just Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2 a little bit of each mostly Modern Warfare 3 because we were supposed to be getting copies to do LAN stuff with but those never came from Activision and at this point I don't think they are coming so I'm not buying copies for everybody so fuck that so we'll just I'll play with my friend and I think that's all I've played this week

288
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:40,821
[SPEAKER_08]: um wait no there's there's one other thing what the hell did I play this week there's one other game I played yeah it's probably not important uh my gaming week as I've talked about before on the show I did pre-order the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation and uh it came whatever you'd buy it too if you actually no since with the reasons that I'll let you finish

289
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the thing.

290
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:49,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the game, and it's fine, but it was a little... I'm doing my playthrough again.

291
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:51,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't done a complete playthrough of the Mass Effect series.

292
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:54,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've talked about the game a lot, and it's because I really enjoy the multiplayer.

293
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of what's been keeping me afloat.

294
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,473
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first time I've really sat down to replay the entire series.

295
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:00,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm doing it this time.

296
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:06,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Renegade's first time I did it at Paragon, and already I'm just seeing such differences in the story.

297
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:07,238
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

298
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing through the first game.

299
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:10,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing it on PlayStation.

300
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:16,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you guys didn't know, this is the first time the original Mass Effect has been on the PlayStation 3.

301
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:19,231
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first time.

302
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:19,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And what?

303
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:20,912
[SPEAKER_08]: The game's five years old.

304
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:24,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Microsoft had an exclusive on it for however many years.

305
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:25,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're just now bringing it out.

306
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:28,540
[SPEAKER_08]: So with all this time to...

307
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:34,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Release it and get it right, you'd think it would be bug-free, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.

308
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:37,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been running into quite a few bugs that are not fun.

309
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:50,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're not game-breaking, so I can't complain too much, but characters facing the wrong way in dialogue scenes, just weird.

310
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:54,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Complete parts skipping, but when I load my game, it plays fine.

311
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're facing the wrong direction?

312
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:55,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

313
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:57,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to ask you a question!

314
00:21:57,654 --> 00:21:57,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

315
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:13,079
[SPEAKER_11]: I only had one thing ever like that happen on the PC version for Mass Effect 3 and that's when you're talking to Liara and Glyph is in the room and if Shepard looks at Glyph then she doesn't look back at Liara at all but that's only for that one conversation

316
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:14,343
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

317
00:22:28,642 --> 00:22:31,403
[SPEAKER_08]: So, which by the way, I didn't get to that demo yet.

318
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:34,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, don't ask me because I haven't played it yet.

319
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:37,766
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I played a little bit of that.

320
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:42,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And besides the bugs, you know, the game itself is still great.

321
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:49,351
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would still say the best version is either going to be 360 or PC, depending on if you're a console or PC.

322
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:49,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually...

323
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,432
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first game, the PC is the superior version.

324
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:52,972
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

325
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:59,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they made, like, the hacking thing is much better and, you know, just the Mako stuff is not as frustrating.

326
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:03,615
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the first game, all the Medigel, not the Medigel, the Omnigel all the time.

327
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

328
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:05,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Or whatever that stuff was.

329
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:05,416
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

330
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, other games I've been playing.

331
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:12,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I got from my rental service Silent Hill Book of Memories on the PSP.

332
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was checking that out a little bit.

333
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:20,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really gotten much further than the original demo, so I can't really say anything in addition to the demo I've already played.

334
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:20,908
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

335
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:27,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hate it, but it isn't really Silent Hill either.

336
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody slapped Silent Hill on a dungeon crawler game.

337
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:31,356
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

338
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, yeah.

339
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,077
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that was the thing.

340
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:35,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, maybe I'll try this and stuff.

341
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:39,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I looked at the back of the box and it had the screenshots.

342
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what is a top-down third-person game?

343
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:41,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

344
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:45,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Alan's comment.

345
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:48,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass Effect 3 still has the exorcism neck bug, which is hilarious.

346
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:49,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Trainer gets it a lot.

347
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:51,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's like they're looking completely over their shoulder.

348
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:52,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it the most with Javik.

349
00:23:53,835 --> 00:24:00,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me put it this way, when I played the series on 360, I don't remember ever seeing a bug until the Omega DLC.

350
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:06,402
[SPEAKER_08]: The Omega DLC was the first time I saw bugs in the 360 version, so just put it out there.

351
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:13,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, by the way, just in case you're curious, the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 1 is based off the 360 version, not the PC version.

352
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:17,208
[SPEAKER_08]: The hacking game is the whole button-pushing thing, not the...

353
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:47,874
[SPEAKER_08]: um uh arrow through the circular lock thing that the PC has so interesting but anyway we've talked enough about that game here on this program so I'm just putting it out there that I do have the trilogy on PlayStation and it's just called being a fan and buying all the things you know what what the problem is okay you know I started off playing it on 360 and it hurt my hand

354
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:56,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna go get another version of a game I've already got on PC when I love my PC version and I can make my Shepard blue.

355
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:57,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Just sayin'.

356
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:04,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just... I was curious about, you know, some of the differences and especially multiplayer on three I wanted to have on the PlayStation.

357
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:05,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Research for the show, Rob.

358
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, research for the show.

359
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not like I'm going to get a free copy, so might as well.

360
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:10,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Might as well.

361
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,062
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

362
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:13,803
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for our gaming week.

363
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:16,324
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll get into gaming news after I mention housekeeping.

364
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:19,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR and, of course, our Facebook.

365
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:23,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

366
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:27,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, don't judge me as she's grabbing another locket.

367
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:29,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to make another pack during break.

368
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:30,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I grabbed one earlier.

369
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:31,933
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so good, but they're not good for you.

370
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:32,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we keep eating them?

371
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:34,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Potatoes are potassium.

372
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:37,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Alan's going to get home and be like, you spoiled dinner.

373
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:41,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to make him a whole big thing of them, okay?

374
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:41,782
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

375
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:44,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some gaming news.

376
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:45,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

377
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:50,030
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so there is another game that's receiving a nomination for Grammy.

378
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:52,492
[SPEAKER_06]: That wonderful game would be Journey.

379
00:25:52,833 --> 00:26:00,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And the soundtrack of the game is, I guess, nominated for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.

380
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:00,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess...

381
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:14,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Journey, The Adventures of Tintin, The Artist, Dark Knight Rises, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.

382
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,190
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty cool if it won.

383
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,811
[SPEAKER_06]: The soundtrack in the game was pretty awesome.

384
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:26,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And you may remember, of course, Civ IV won that award, I guess, was that last year?

385
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:31,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists

386
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:43,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Siv-4 came out in what, 08?

387
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:44,113
[SPEAKER_08]: But

388
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:02,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

389
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:46,765
[SPEAKER_08]: so um and I'm not not belittling that achievement by any means that's an amazing thing the amazing piece of work by Christopher Tinn and so happy that he got acknowledged for that um but this is interesting because now this is you know music that was made for the game released on the game soundtrack an entire body of work dedicated to the game getting nominated for the Grammy and certainly that's

390
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:54,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like we dipped our toe in with Baba Yetu, and now we're starting to put the whole foot in by nominating a game soundtrack.

391
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,683
[SPEAKER_08]: And in reality, this is almost as good as it gets.

392
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:12,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Video game soundtrack songs are not going to really get nominated for Song of the Year unless you have something on the caliber of the Titanic song was the last soundtrack song I can think of that got nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy.

393
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:15,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're long, long away from that.

394
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:22,630
[SPEAKER_08]: but being up there with all those films that's an awesome achievement so now the question is he going to win?

395
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:45,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know I know it's hard to say we're not really in the music industry so certainly it's got to be getting him a little more exposure though than the competition but at the same time the artist won the Grammy didn't it or the artist excuse me the artist won the Oscar didn't it so it's you know

396
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:53,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that really ties in just because it won the Oscar doesn't mean I'm going to win for music.

397
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:54,259
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.

398
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,360
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know what will happen.

399
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,703
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a different body of voters and you never know.

400
00:28:57,723 --> 00:29:03,711
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some people like us that kind of look at it and go, yeah, video games should be getting more recognition.

401
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:06,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Or there'll be people that react quite the opposite.

402
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:08,902
[SPEAKER_08]: It just really depends on who's voting on those.

403
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:15,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, It won't win.

404
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:16,848
[SPEAKER_08]: It's flat out, it won't win.

405
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:18,169
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is what we wanted.

406
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if not winning is what we wanted.

407
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:24,353
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, I don't think that's what he's trying to say.

408
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:28,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's trying to say the acknowledgement next to the film scores is what we wanted.

409
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, I think to some extent that is what we want.

410
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Could they possibly have a separate category for game soundtracks someday?

411
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:40,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Could they be getting confused with Journey the Game and Journey the Band?

412
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I love Journey.

413
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,469
[SPEAKER_06]: They should totally get nominated for Best Soundtrack Score.

414
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

415
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:49,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think Journey's been nominated for a Grammy since 82.

416
00:29:50,514 --> 00:29:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they need to score the next Tron movie.

417
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:56,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

418
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more news.

419
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:00,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't stop light speeding.

420
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:07,076
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's about a comment from Gabe Newell on living room PCs, which I want to preface this story.

421
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:14,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You were showing me before the show, Loki, this big screen mode in Steam, which I got to be honest, I haven't played a lot with, but you were showing it to me.

422
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:25,906
[SPEAKER_08]: And in a nutshell, it does turn your Steam environment into a Xbox style UI that takes up your full monitor space.

423
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:26,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

424
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:27,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't look like Windows anymore.

425
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:28,928
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks nice, I think.

426
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:29,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

427
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:43,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the ability that it basically, since it is catered towards using a joystick, which is fine, that you can sort your games based on joystick support, whether the games have it or not, which is kind of cool.

428
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:47,675
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing I wish they would add, and maybe this is something that they can add later on, is like...

429
00:30:48,155 --> 00:31:04,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Those games that do not support joysticks, maybe have it where you can have some sort of in-Steam client app or something like that where you can set up almost like an expatter type thing where you can assign keys to the joystick buttons, and then that way you can have a profile for each thing.

430
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:13,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of these games, and actually it's funny because Arma 2 is one that supports the joystick, and I thought that was one that didn't support the Xbox gamepad.

431
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:16,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, huh, that already does, so sweet.

432
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:16,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

433
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:22,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not like a wireless keyboard to use as a controller for a game console is unheard of.

434
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Final Fantasy XI?

435
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:38,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but see, the thing is, as I was looking at it, I'm like, you know, that would not be that... It wouldn't be that weird to actually... You know, this whole... Everyone's kind of talking about doom and gloom with the next console cycle and stuff.

436
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:45,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that it's ever going to happen, but if it went the way where, oh, we're going to lock all this stuff down, you're not going to be able to sell used games and stuff like that.

437
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Would playing on PC be that bad?

438
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,224
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think it would be that bad, actually.

439
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:52,688
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's all going through Steam, it seems very convenient for me.

440
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:56,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, the vast majority of the games I have on Steam I have not played yet.

441
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:01,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just that keeps adding to the list.

442
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep getting things for it.

443
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have quite a collection that it would be kind of cool to have.

444
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:29,261
[SPEAKER_08]: A gaming PC hooked up to my TV to play stuff like that Well, that is where Gabe Newell thinks things are going Meaning that those types of living room PCs are going to be big competition for the next-gen gaming cycle This is in an interview with Kotaku at the VGAs Because, you know, Gary Newell was there Was that what she called him?

445
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:29,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Gary Newell?

446
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:30,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

447
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:31,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of messed up.

448
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:34,045
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a clip somewhere.

449
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:36,706
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the interviewees called him the wrong name.

450
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:39,648
[SPEAKER_08]: You're Gabe from Penny Arcade, right?

451
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:41,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Gabe Duell.

452
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,011
[SPEAKER_08]: She apologized for it.

453
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:43,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Cousin of Dudley D. Wright.

454
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:45,172
[SPEAKER_08]: She apologized for it on Twitter.

455
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:52,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got to say, you know, live TV sucks sometimes, especially, you know, it can be a lot of pressure.

456
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So I shouldn't give her too hard of a time, but...

457
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:58,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, she's going to get yelled at for that mistake.

458
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:09,864
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, Gabe Newell doing his thing on the red carpet of VGAs, talking to Kotaku, talking about that the big picture interface ended up being stronger than expected.

459
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:13,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, they want Steam Linux out of beta.

460
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:16,106
[SPEAKER_08]: They want big picture on that operating system.

461
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:19,788
[SPEAKER_08]: This gives Valve flexibility in developing their own hardware.

462
00:33:20,068 --> 00:33:20,568
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

463
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:22,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at OUYA

464
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,002
[SPEAKER_08]: OUYA is a bare-ass bones type of living room PC.

465
00:33:41,383 --> 00:33:44,765
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's that same setup as you would see with big picture mode.

466
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:47,006
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, the interface looks kind of similar.

467
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:48,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I do like big picture a little bit.

468
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:49,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, from what I've seen.

469
00:33:50,048 --> 00:33:51,568
[SPEAKER_06]: We obviously don't know what the OUYA looks like.

470
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, we're not that far away.

471
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and that OUYA thing, man, is smaller than this box right here.

472
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:00,313
[SPEAKER_06]: My four pack of Red Bulls.

473
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:16,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Gabe Newell said in the interview, quote, I think in general that most customers and most developers are going to find that the PC is a better environment for them because they won't have to split the world into thinking about why are my friends in the living room?

474
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are my video sources in the living room different from everyone else?

475
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:23,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a sense, we hopefully are going to unify those environments.

476
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:24,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

477
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:27,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

478
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:28,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

479
00:34:30,182 --> 00:34:32,022
[SPEAKER_08]: The unification thing is interesting.

480
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:37,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in a way that's what the consoles kind of want to be that all-in-one device.

481
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:44,546
[SPEAKER_08]: And you do see that like 360 tries to talk to Windows Media and all that sharing.

482
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:48,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And even the PlayStation 3, you can kind of stream things off your PC and so forth.

483
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:52,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not exactly intuitive on either one how to do it.

484
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:58,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if a lot of that was built a little more into the interfaces, you'd see a lot more of that.

485
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:02,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they make it too many clicks to get to a lot of that stuff within the consoles.

486
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:04,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's interesting.

487
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:10,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it definitely lends something to the fact of if they sold a little gaming PC in a box,

488
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:18,243
[SPEAKER_08]: that looked like a console, hooked up to your TV like a console, ran like a console, why would I need a console?

489
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:29,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Price point, because I think console prices, it's going to be hard to build a gaming PC for $400 that can run all of these games and look nice.

490
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:37,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, you can build a $400 gaming PC, but it's not going to run a lot of these games in higher ultra and stuff.

491
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:45,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're streaming to your TV via HDMI, you're talking a really large resolution, 1080p.

492
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:52,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be a little hard to make them look that nice and run on that big of a resolution.

493
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:54,507
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing.

494
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:59,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, a lot of the games get stripped down a bit.

495
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:01,652
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.

496
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:06,776
[SPEAKER_06]: With PCs, and like, hell, I spent $1,700 on my PC a few years ago.

497
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just like this high-end thing.

498
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,179
[SPEAKER_06]: It ran Crysis, pretty awesome.

499
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:12,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now it's just, it's junk.

500
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:17,144
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, I can't even upgrade it without replacing everything.

501
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:20,086
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's nothing I can salvage from it.

502
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the case.

503
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the heatsinks, but...

504
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:25,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else is just, it's so old.

505
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:36,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I find the part where he talks about how Linux, the Steam on Linux has to get better so that they can kind of develop a box that supports Linux and so forth.

506
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:41,783
[SPEAKER_08]: That strikes me as interesting because why do video game consoles usually work the way they do?

507
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:44,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're dedicated gaming consoles.

508
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:48,568
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have all this excess fat for all the other things that a PC does.

509
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:48,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

510
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:58,811
[SPEAKER_08]: But the interesting thing about Linux is that, as I understand it, part of the reason people are such fans of Linux is that it's a lean operating system and it doesn't have all the fat that Windows has with it.

511
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:00,372
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm running on my netbook.

512
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:03,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Would that be a fair statement about Linux?

513
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:04,493
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say so.

514
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:07,534
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got the control that Windows lacks.

515
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:13,657
[SPEAKER_08]: So they want to use a better operating system, essentially, to do a dedicated thing.

516
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:16,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Which makes sense.

517
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:21,419
[SPEAKER_08]: But could it be as powerful as a dedicated gaming console?

518
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:21,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

519
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:22,719
[SPEAKER_08]: You make a good point.

520
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:27,220
[SPEAKER_08]: You expect that a little set-top box is going to do this 1080p, and it probably won't.

521
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:42,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, a lot of the games on Steam, aside from the big console AAA games, like the indie games, a lot of the indie games don't require a lot of processing power, I think, that you would need on some of these higher-end games.

522
00:37:43,623 --> 00:38:10,463
[SPEAKER_06]: but there are those higher end games that they're also on Steam and a lot of those are the ones that support the controllers so it's going to be hard granted a lot of stuff is going to come down in cost and you can probably build something a little bit cheaper but I think it's going to be difficult for them to come up with something that you can fit in a box small enough because you also have to worry about heat and everything fitting it into a console sized box it's going to be a lot of engineering to get it right

523
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:16,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Akuma JP in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, what's wrong with being a chubby?

524
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:20,426
[SPEAKER_08]: There is nothing wrong with being a little fluffy.

525
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:27,488
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll notice in that whole thing I just talked about, I didn't say I was going to throw out my Windows PC.

526
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,409
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, there's still things that I'll want one of those for.

527
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just want to take a quick look real quick.

528
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,511
[SPEAKER_06]: The Alienware one.

529
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, they have their console thing.

530
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:37,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just, you know, an idea.

531
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:42,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's the X51 mini gaming desktop.

532
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:48,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And the base price, because it's from Dell, the base price you can pay for that is $699.

533
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:49,801
[SPEAKER_06]: So, $700 for this console.

534
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,946
[SPEAKER_06]: $699 US dollars.

535
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,047
[SPEAKER_06]: $699 US dollars.

536
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's what you get for $699.

537
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:06,352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Core i3, which, I mean, that's not going to run some high-end stuff there.

538
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:11,516
[SPEAKER_06]: You get 6 gigabytes of RAM, you know, a 1 terabyte hard drive.

539
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:16,899
[SPEAKER_06]: GeForce 640 GT, which is a pretty good graphics card.

540
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,801
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the top, top, top of the line.

541
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:24,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, the Core i3 is really going to hurt it, I think.

542
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:26,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

543
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:30,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems quite expensive to build something that form factor.

544
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you don't need to pay Alienware to do it.

545
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,933
[SPEAKER_06]: You can build your own smaller PCs for probably a lot cheaper than that.

546
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:39,336
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what computer I'm hooking up to my TV as soon as I can?

547
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:40,577
[SPEAKER_08]: The Commodore 64.

548
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:58,293
[SPEAKER_08]: and I gotta say, tangent time, to Alan's credit, he told me that he was trying to get me a Commodore 64 for Christmas but it's probably not gonna come through because he tried to do an eBay auction and he didn't, you know, it's outside of his price range or whatever but I was like, damn, that would've been...

549
00:39:58,773 --> 00:39:59,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome!

550
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:02,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, you just need to go down to the Denios or something like that.

551
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:06,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I don't look every time I go to see if one's out there.

552
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:08,283
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to make sure it works.

553
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:11,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually do go by the thrift stores and keep an eye open, too.

554
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:16,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my parents supposedly still have our old one, and my dad's kept it all these years, and it might still work.

555
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:18,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said I want them to find it.

556
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:20,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what I'm going to play on it.

557
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:21,115
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing.

558
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:22,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I just fucking want one, okay?

559
00:40:25,578 --> 00:40:26,279
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

560
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:51,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Weird Al.

561
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:57,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I did tell him, and this is advice for anybody that might be looking for this retrotastic machine.

562
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:03,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget that there's also the Commodore 64C, which is totally fine.

563
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:05,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It's smaller and has white keys.

564
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:10,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like PS Mini and PS2 or whatever.

565
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:11,184
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same type of thing.

566
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:15,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the Commodore 128, which had 64 mode.

567
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:18,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So 128s are totally fine.

568
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:20,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Just throwing it out there.

569
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody get robbed at Commodore 64.

570
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunstar reminds us the C64 version of Donkey Kong was rad.

571
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It was because it had the Pie Factory level.

572
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:30,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

573
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:34,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is really supposed to be a metal, a cement factory or something, but it's pies.

574
00:41:34,544 --> 00:41:35,325
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the Pie Factory.

575
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:36,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what you mean.

576
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:40,907
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say that looks-wise, the ColecoVision version was really good.

577
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:42,889
[SPEAKER_08]: for ColecoVision.

578
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:46,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, the Coleco version of Mousetrap was the best one ever.

579
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:47,533
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

580
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:48,754
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, more news.

581
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:49,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh, Rob.

582
00:41:50,055 --> 00:41:51,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Less ColecoVision, something more current.

583
00:41:51,697 --> 00:41:53,458
[SPEAKER_11]: How about Nintendo being buttheads?

584
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:58,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know what you can't do, at least according to Nintendo of Europe?

585
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:02,466
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot access 18 related content at certain times of the day.

586
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:05,809
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, you get a little message that says, you can't do this, meh.

587
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:17,299
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually, one of the NeoGAF users actually had the issue and contacted Nintendo of Italy's customer support and got this message.

588
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:25,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear customer, we would like to let you know that Nintendo is always aimed to offer gameplay experiences suited to all age groups.

589
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:31,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Observing carefully the relevant regulations regarding content access that are present in the various European countries.

590
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:35,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like in that same voice you should be saying, For English, press 1.

591
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Para Español, marque numero 2.

592
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,570
[SPEAKER_08]: WaterShowerSauce

593
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,213
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's like, you've got to be up all night to download anything.

594
00:43:17,273 --> 00:43:17,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Meh.

595
00:43:18,654 --> 00:43:20,335
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, ugh, whatever, Nintendo.

596
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:22,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they've done this crap here, though.

597
00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:22,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Have they?

598
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:23,178
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

599
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:23,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

600
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:27,121
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I guess Nintendo really doesn't like Europe.

601
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:30,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless they want to give them RPGs that we want.

602
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:33,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's because Nintendo doesn't like Europe, Jamie.

603
00:43:33,226 --> 00:43:34,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's some type of...

604
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:37,190
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't like Italy.

605
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:41,195
[SPEAKER_08]: My gut would say it's a law thing, but I'm like, I don't think there is a law.

606
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:42,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a culture thing?

607
00:43:43,058 --> 00:43:45,841
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a cover your ass type of thing, which is all Nintendo ever does.

608
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:52,550
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think they would have tried to do it here too, except I think Reggie probably put his foot down or shoved up someone's ass and said no.

609
00:43:54,227 --> 00:43:59,832
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird because I want to come out and say this isn't bad.

610
00:44:00,092 --> 00:44:01,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I'm doing a search.

611
00:44:01,173 --> 00:44:03,835
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is bad because I should be able to get what I want.

612
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:09,459
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad if it only comes on when you have parental controls on.

613
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:11,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Then that's a great idea.

614
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:13,782
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be a great idea for parental controls.

615
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:19,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, honestly, why would you want your kids using the shop unattended anyway?

616
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:22,830
[SPEAKER_11]: They can let kids drink wine.

617
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:26,502
[SPEAKER_11]: But they can't see boobs or blood.

618
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,563
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't have boobs in video game.

619
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:31,303
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, in Europe's culture, boobs are a little less.

620
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:33,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because America is freaking backwards.

621
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:34,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, exactly.

622
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:38,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So violence is much more of a thing over there.

623
00:44:38,585 --> 00:44:48,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe that's the difference because we're so desensitized through a lot of the movies like Saw and all that shit, which is taboo over there.

624
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:50,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's the difference.

625
00:44:50,347 --> 00:44:50,767
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

626
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:52,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everyone needs to get over it.

627
00:44:53,891 --> 00:45:07,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's my thing is I wonder if this was kind of a shock for the third parties that are involved in this because if you think about it, that's why am I going to put my game on your marketplace if you're going to limit the sale to only four hours out of a 24-hour day?

628
00:45:08,393 --> 00:45:09,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Brilliant question.

629
00:45:10,384 --> 00:45:12,347
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt In all reality, yes.

630
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:14,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to know what the third parties have to say about it.

631
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Who, by the way, sent me a Hanukkah card.

632
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:18,576
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt, my first one of the year.

633
00:45:18,937 --> 00:45:24,325
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, he actually says parental controls are hard for parents, especially stupid ones.

634
00:45:26,878 --> 00:45:27,219
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

635
00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:52,466
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

636
00:46:09,464 --> 00:46:09,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, fuck.

637
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:21,989
[SPEAKER_06]: This person that knows about these games is probably most likely going to be able to read most of the blogs out there on the internet and go, hey, well, all I have to do is download this at 11 p.m.

638
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:23,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And they downloaded it at 11 p.m.

639
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:28,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Kids shouldn't be using this parent's credit card on the store at any hour of the day.

640
00:46:29,032 --> 00:46:30,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know whose problem that is?

641
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:31,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Their parents.

642
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's whose problem it should always be.

643
00:46:33,814 --> 00:46:34,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Their parents.

644
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: See, here's the thing.

645
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:37,175
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not be using their card.

646
00:46:37,215 --> 00:46:43,216
[SPEAKER_06]: They may be buying a prepaid card at a store and putting it in that way.

647
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:43,836
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

648
00:46:44,076 --> 00:46:45,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's ways around everything.

649
00:46:45,697 --> 00:46:47,817
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, there's ways around everything.

650
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:48,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So why limit it?

651
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:53,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and I know the comment about parental controls being hard earlier was said in jest or a joke or whatever.

652
00:46:53,758 --> 00:47:00,760
[SPEAKER_08]: But seriously, when you first turn on the Wii U, the first time you're going through the initial setup,

653
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,080
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a question.

654
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:04,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you wish to enable parental controls?

655
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:05,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes or no?

656
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:12,607
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the parent has to do is be there when their $400 machine is turned on for the first time.

657
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:18,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm pretty sure if this is like any other Nintendo console or device that comes with... $300, excuse me.

658
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:26,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Four thick fucking manuals that probably tell you how to set up parental controls if you really wanted to.

659
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:26,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

660
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:28,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

661
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:46,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Censorship is a fucking bitch ass whore slut

662
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:02,207
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what it is?

663
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:02,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

664
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:10,713
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that these violent game trailers and games on the internet are very disturbing to elderly people who thankfully do not stay up past 11.

665
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:15,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Although... Yes, they all just magically fall asleep right before 11.

666
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:17,699
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why, though, that it only goes till 3.

667
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:20,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of them do wake up quite early in the morning.

668
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's that 11 to 3 period that most elderly people are asleep.

669
00:48:24,143 --> 00:48:26,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why they're hiding this.

670
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:27,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not because of the kids.

671
00:48:27,245 --> 00:48:28,046
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the elderly people.

672
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:32,949
[SPEAKER_08]: VX, Jason, XV, and Chap wants to throw out a theory, and it's a good one, so let me throw it out there.

673
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:47,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo is classified as a media service, TV, and now they have to abide by TV laws, which restricts content to those hours in some countries.

674
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:50,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a bad thought.

675
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this because Nintendo is not treating itself as a game device anymore?

676
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember, they make their own fucking rules.

677
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:57,801
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not an X-Gen system.

678
00:48:58,142 --> 00:48:59,442
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Nintendo-Gen system.

679
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:02,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is now a television.

680
00:49:02,683 --> 00:49:06,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so, because look at the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

681
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:13,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say they have as many, if not more, streaming content on there than Nintendo.

682
00:49:13,908 --> 00:49:14,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

683
00:49:14,768 --> 00:49:18,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you restrict the rules to one console and not the others?

684
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:21,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is just something Nintendo is doing on their own.

685
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:27,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is anything they're forcing them to do because why aren't they forcing the other guys to do the same thing?

686
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:31,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just Nintendo asshattery.

687
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:32,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what they do.

688
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:43,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's ass-hattery, but it's very throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which we've seen Nintendo do so many times before, like Friend Codes.

689
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:50,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Friend Codes was set up to protect, you know, kids, and we all had to suffer for it.

690
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:55,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same dumb decision that screwed that up that's screwing this up.

691
00:49:55,445 --> 00:49:56,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God it didn't happen here.

692
00:49:58,257 --> 00:50:02,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Although at the same time, do you really need to download Zombie U online?

693
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't you just go to the store and buy it or get it on Amazon?

694
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:07,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, just wait.

695
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:12,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Amazon, there's a perfect way you can do that.

696
00:50:13,748 --> 00:50:14,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

697
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:19,152
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be the point of downloading this stuff to your console?

698
00:50:19,192 --> 00:50:19,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

699
00:50:21,169 --> 00:50:22,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll throw this out there for what it's worth.

700
00:50:45,123 --> 00:51:11,134
[SPEAKER_08]: you don't have to pay tax on them right now technically you do, you have to report that to the state and your taxes at the end of the year but let's be real, who's doing that so you get them tax free that's not that much of a savings and you get the 10% kickback from Nintendo if you have a Wii Deluxe or Wii U Deluxe which most people probably do that have the Wii U right now I don't think that would be much of a motivator for me

701
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:13,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

702
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:15,189
[SPEAKER_08]: That is something.

703
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:18,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get it right now.

704
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:21,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, an hour from now when it finishes downloading.

705
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Faster than Amazon.

706
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:28,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

707
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:31,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Wii U has sold 425,000 units in the US after being out there for a week.

708
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So compare that to some of the other systems.

709
00:51:41,215 --> 00:51:49,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the Xbox 360 and PS3 and the original... Well, the original Wii, I want to say, sold only 300,000 units during that same time period.

710
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:51,661
[SPEAKER_06]: The original Wii?

711
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:53,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they say in that same article it's 475.

712
00:51:53,462 --> 00:51:53,162
475?

713
00:51:53,502 --> 00:51:53,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

714
00:51:53,883 --> 00:51:57,685
[SPEAKER_06]: It sold 475 in its first week, but I'm talking about actually now.

715
00:51:57,705 --> 00:51:58,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it sold only...

716
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was 300,000 units or something like that.

717
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:10,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It was still pretty high.

718
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:15,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the Xbox 360, I think it was three quarters of a million.

719
00:52:15,992 --> 00:52:19,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to say the PS3 was like five or something like that.

720
00:52:22,034 --> 00:52:22,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it's pretty good.

721
00:52:23,194 --> 00:52:23,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my thing, though.

722
00:52:24,534 --> 00:52:27,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is unlike the Wii.

723
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:30,896
[SPEAKER_06]: See, remember with the Wii, the whole reason was shortages on this stuff.

724
00:52:31,796 --> 00:52:43,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Last I checked, I went to the store, like I went to Walmart one day, and I was like, you know what, I'm just going to go walk down Electronics Island and see what they've got as far, let's see if they have any Wii U's, just see if they've finally gotten stocked.

725
00:52:43,965 --> 00:52:46,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a stack of 10 Wii U's.

726
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:49,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't like, oh, people are clamoring to get this stuff.

727
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:50,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just sitting there, no one gave a shit.

728
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:57,055
[SPEAKER_06]: and same with like you go on like GameStop and you can do a search of their inventories and stuff like that.

729
00:52:57,235 --> 00:53:04,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd say about the majority, well, all of them had some stock on them and some of them had quite a bit of stock on them.

730
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:13,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that they were doing more to replenish them, but I'm thinking that the demand on this isn't as high as they had hoped.

731
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:18,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, 425,000 sounds awesome, but is that going to dip off really fast?

732
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:18,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Because...

733
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:21,472
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just sitting there now.

734
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:23,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

735
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:25,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

736
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:27,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's still too soon to tell.

737
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:34,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to see what the entire holiday season looks like, and we need to see what the Fury looks like after the holidays.

738
00:53:35,406 --> 00:53:39,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, was it just a holiday thing, or is it still in demand in January and February?

739
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,992
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what it's going to take to keep that demand going?

740
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:43,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Games!

741
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:44,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've got...

742
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:48,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Pikmin in March.

743
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:50,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U games.

744
00:53:51,105 --> 00:53:53,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me refresh my memory.

745
00:53:53,085 --> 00:53:53,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U games.

746
00:53:53,766 --> 00:53:58,147
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got 30 Great Games.

747
00:53:58,387 --> 00:53:59,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that game?

748
00:53:59,047 --> 00:54:04,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Family Party, 30 Great Games, Arcade, or Obstacle Arcade.

749
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:09,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me you've seen the Miiverse stuff for the 30 Great Games stuff.

750
00:54:10,783 --> 00:54:19,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, Miiverse is becoming more and more one of the most genius things to happen in gaming ever.

751
00:54:20,146 --> 00:54:22,926
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not giving Nintendo all that credit.

752
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:25,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an idiot savant type of genius.

753
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unintended genius.

754
00:54:28,888 --> 00:54:31,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Miiverse is amazing.

755
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:36,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen the stuff on Miiverse for some of these shovelware games that show up?

756
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:37,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I gotta get the Wii.

757
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:38,851
[SPEAKER_08]: You've gotta see this.

758
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:43,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you'll laugh your ass off at some of the stuff that people are posting in Miiverse on these games.

759
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:44,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

760
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:52,534
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was gonna see, like, right now I'm looking just to see what's in this area, you know, as far as, like, availability.

761
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:53,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see here.

762
00:54:54,534 --> 00:54:59,315
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one, Low Stock, In Stock, In Stock, In Stock, Low Stock, In Stock, In Stock, In Stock.

763
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:02,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the, you know, first eight stores that they have there.

764
00:55:03,156 --> 00:55:06,897
[SPEAKER_06]: InStock, InStock, InStock, LowStock, InStock, LowStock, LowStock.

765
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:14,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like within 20 miles of us, they are stocked at every single GameStop.

766
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:20,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the same thing happening at Walmarts, Targets, probably everywhere.

767
00:55:20,582 --> 00:55:26,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So that begs the question, I mean, I understand this may be a hot holiday item, but...

768
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:35,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's as in demand as they want everyone to believe it is.

769
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:40,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't get me wrong, they have some pretty good games at launch, but they don't really have anything coming out.

770
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:43,370
[SPEAKER_06]: The first Wii U game I can think of is in March.

771
00:55:44,231 --> 00:55:46,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Rayman Legends is the... Not March.

772
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:49,053
[SPEAKER_06]: February 26th is Rayman Legends.

773
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:52,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the first big game to come out next.

774
00:55:53,454 --> 00:55:53,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

775
00:55:55,185 --> 00:56:05,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, that's like a whole month and a half, almost two and a half months of nothing for the Wii U. I mean, that's kind of bad.

776
00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:09,482
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quite a drought of games.

777
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:14,608
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

778
00:56:39,591 --> 00:56:40,292
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

779
00:56:59,668 --> 00:57:00,148
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on his head?

780
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:25,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was from Nintendo Direct.

781
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:32,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, it's just your average forum with all sorts of memes in here.

782
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:38,230
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is Nintendo moderated and Nintendo endorsed on the console.

783
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:41,814
[SPEAKER_08]: If you press pause and hit Miiverse, that is what you'll see.

784
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:49,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's cool that they're only removing offensive stuff, but not a lot of memes are offensive.

785
00:57:49,822 --> 00:57:53,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see a lot of the stuff with the jokes about shovels?

786
00:57:53,684 --> 00:57:57,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I understand the Nintendo seal of crap.

787
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:01,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but I hardly call this genius.

788
00:58:01,608 --> 00:58:03,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I just call this your standard forum.

789
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:05,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you not entertained?

790
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:06,950
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not entertained.

791
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:10,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just...

792
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:13,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't... I don't know.

793
00:58:13,927 --> 00:58:15,269
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... This just in, everybody.

794
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is not amused.

795
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:17,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have Barry Potter.

796
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And Batman that says, I have no family.

797
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:25,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

798
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:27,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

799
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:31,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is that great.

800
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was better the first couple days.

801
00:58:34,784 --> 00:58:36,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it's wearing off.

802
00:58:37,187 --> 00:58:37,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

803
00:58:37,888 --> 00:58:40,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to look, DarkSakura?

804
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:41,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of funny, I guess.

805
00:58:43,336 --> 00:58:51,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, Panorama View was originally unveiled at E3, but they announced that it is coming in the spring, obviously.

806
00:58:51,781 --> 00:59:03,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming, Google Maps for Wii U. The Street View functionality with Google Maps will work with the gamepad just like Panorama View, because those Google cars take...

807
00:59:04,228 --> 00:59:08,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I better buy a Wii U so I can get Google Maps What's with the flying penis rocket ship?

808
00:59:34,725 --> 00:59:38,126
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Miiverse.

809
00:59:38,186 --> 00:59:41,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody tried to get away with drawing a penis on Miiverse, so they drew it as a rocket ship.

810
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:42,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, this isn't uncomfortable.

811
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:46,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I thought you played with the Wii U thing before.

812
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:49,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Not with your little thing here.

813
00:59:50,372 --> 00:59:51,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to say anything about your little thing.

814
00:59:53,473 --> 00:59:53,753
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

815
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:57,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

816
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,836
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, it's actually your turn.

817
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:01,257
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have to put the tablet down for a minute.

818
01:00:02,191 --> 01:00:03,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Take your evil away from me, Rob

819
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:17,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, next, uh, there, and this, people have been going off about this, and, you know what, I was gonna be super skeptical of it until I actually did look at the logo.

820
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:27,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Needless to say, I'm talking about the Phantom Pain, which, basically, it's a trailer of a guy that they had at the, um, VGAs.

821
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:33,168
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy has a hook arm, and he's like, you're just waking up, and then a hundred feet soldier, brr,

822
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:35,131
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting killed out here.

823
01:00:36,796 --> 01:00:40,205
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you look at the guy walking around, he's got a gray mullet.

824
01:00:41,858 --> 01:00:46,320
[SPEAKER_11]: And a shaggy beard when you can sort of see his face, but most of his face is covered up in bandages.

825
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,881
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's missing a hand, he's got a hook arm.

826
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:54,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's being put out by this Moby Dick Studios.

827
01:00:55,463 --> 01:01:00,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, I mean, I can't really think of anything how Moby Dick itself could be an allusion towards it.

828
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:05,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, I mean, it's just a big revenge story, so maybe there's some revenge subplot?

829
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:05,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

830
01:01:06,648 --> 01:01:09,531
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

831
01:01:23,184 --> 01:01:32,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, as I posted much earlier in the chat room, is that if you look at the logo, there are little chunks missing out of the text.

832
01:01:32,928 --> 01:01:52,077
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you use the same typeface and align it to these little markings that are coming out of the text, it perfectly fits the shape of Metal Gear Solid V. And I will relink the photo in the chat room for those who are curious.

833
01:01:53,017 --> 01:02:18,831
[SPEAKER_11]: but I mean and I mean I'm even looking it has to be of course in the same typeface but it is a perfect match it's sort of like they posted it there and then used the pathfinder tool in InDesign or something for anyone who knows what that is but it's I guess I see it now I didn't see it at first until I looked at the logo

834
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,923
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense that it's time for another Metal Gear Solid.

835
01:02:24,963 --> 01:02:27,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they always say the other one's going to be the last one, but come on.

836
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:31,148
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll take that until it stops making money.

837
01:02:31,368 --> 01:02:31,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

838
01:02:31,908 --> 01:02:33,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's Metal Gear Solid.

839
01:02:33,609 --> 01:02:35,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's New Bionic Commando.

840
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:36,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And spoiler!

841
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:36,692
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

842
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:38,673
[SPEAKER_06]: His wife is his claw.

843
01:02:42,195 --> 01:02:42,436
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

844
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:45,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiler!

845
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:48,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look at the picture that I linked in the chat room, guys.

846
01:02:50,154 --> 01:02:54,636
[SPEAKER_06]: The Supreme Court is going to decide next year if I get to get married or not, but you can marry your AI.

847
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,987
[SPEAKER_11]: To quote Rob, put her in a CD, I don't care.

848
01:03:22,307 --> 01:03:25,308
[SPEAKER_06]: They had all those tubes and they're like, we need to fill the tubes with something.

849
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:29,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So they just threw his wife in a wood chipper, shoved her in the tubes for the final commando.

850
01:03:30,729 --> 01:03:32,369
[SPEAKER_06]: You shouldn't put your wife in a wood chipper.

851
01:03:32,429 --> 01:03:33,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.

852
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,650
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll say she can't, but put her in there anyway.

853
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he didn't put her in a... I don't know.

854
01:03:38,771 --> 01:03:40,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you put your wife in a wood chipper?

855
01:03:40,631 --> 01:03:41,091
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really rude.

856
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:46,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he's just really into self-gratification and so, you know, he thought his wife is the claw.

857
01:03:47,193 --> 01:03:47,773
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.

858
01:03:48,753 --> 01:03:49,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Men.

859
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:51,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the claw touches him and weighs it.

860
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:52,496
[SPEAKER_11]: The claw.

861
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:53,777
[SPEAKER_06]: His hand can't.

862
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,699
[SPEAKER_11]: It decides who will go and who will stay.

863
01:03:56,659 --> 01:03:59,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we please, please get to release dates?

864
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

865
01:04:00,062 --> 01:04:02,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I'm not expecting to hear an awful lot, but let's see.

866
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:03,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Release dates.

867
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:04,385
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

868
01:04:04,485 --> 01:04:08,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So this week we've got the game of the year, The Walking Dead.

869
01:04:09,669 --> 01:04:13,092
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hulk basically season one on PS3 and Xbox 360.

870
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:13,212

873
01:04:57,278 --> 01:04:58,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Not anymore, really.

874
01:04:58,219 --> 01:04:59,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever watched Jeopardy lately?

875
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only watch Celebrity Jeopardy.

876
01:05:03,823 --> 01:05:04,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn you, Trebek!

877
01:05:05,884 --> 01:05:11,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing transformed on the Vita.

878
01:05:12,429 --> 01:05:14,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was like, isn't that on every platform?

879
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,591
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not the Vita.

880
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:16,932
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DS.

881
01:05:17,152 --> 01:05:19,193
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DS got delayed a little further.

882
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:21,795
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it!

883
01:05:22,035 --> 01:05:24,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate to say it, I think that's it for the rest of the year.

884
01:05:25,017 --> 01:05:25,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

885
01:05:27,158 --> 01:05:27,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Port Royale 3

886
01:05:48,605 --> 01:05:51,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't recognize this as a series here.

887
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:59,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in August, I think.

888
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:00,918
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a Pirates game.

889
01:06:01,038 --> 01:06:02,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a Pirates simulation game.

890
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,222
[SPEAKER_08]: But not Sid Meier's Pirates.

891
01:06:04,322 --> 01:06:08,687
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Calypso, I want to say, puts that out.

892
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:11,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Russell in Japan.

893
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:16,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I think over here it's Calypso.

894
01:06:16,453 --> 01:06:18,354
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the guys that put out Tropico.

895
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a trading sim.

896
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:24,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Pirate or Trader.

897
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:31,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Much busier week on the PlayStation 3, Battlefield 3 also there as well, and Port Royale 3.

898
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:36,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Ninja Gaiden Sigma also gets a price reduction along with Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus.

899
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:46,361
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as new games go, Sango Kushi 12 comes out in regular and premium editions from Koei.

900
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:47,362
[SPEAKER_08]: This is...

[SPEAKER_08]: Depending where you order it from, yes.

905
01:08:03,078 --> 01:08:05,901
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys are dressed up like it all in like little suits.

906
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:09,445
[SPEAKER_08]: They're little chibi suit characters, but this one has an eye patch, so you know he's rough.

907
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:11,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Chibi Snake Chibi Snake

908
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:35,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Sango Kushi 12 comes out on the Wii U this week in Japan as well.

01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:41,075
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, checking the 3DS, Biohazard Mercenaries 3D gets a price reduction.

[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Puyo Puyo gets a price reduction.

[SPEAKER_11]: Puyo Puyo.

01:08:58,786 --> 01:08:59,386
[SPEAKER_08]: No one cur.

916
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:00,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I care.

917
01:09:01,948 --> 01:09:03,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, one cur.

918
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:05,910
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it for Japanese release dates.

919
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,792
[SPEAKER_11]: In Europe, not a damn thing.

920
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:10,232
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

921
01:09:11,593 --> 01:09:12,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, not a damn thing.

922
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:14,995
[SPEAKER_11]: The game will be out the entire week.

923
01:09:15,895 --> 01:09:18,557
[SPEAKER_11]: A different version for every system that has ever existed all week.

924
01:09:21,294 --> 01:09:21,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm serious.

925
01:09:23,217 --> 01:09:23,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a damn thing.

926
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:25,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Just crickets?

927
01:09:26,402 --> 01:09:26,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Just crickets.

928
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing until the 17th.

929
01:09:30,428 --> 01:09:31,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is not this week.

930
01:09:33,519 --> 01:09:36,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do a couple more stories before the classic game of the week then.

931
01:09:37,162 --> 01:09:44,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Motorola has failed to ban the Xbox in both the US and Germany.

932
01:09:45,067 --> 01:09:55,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently, I guess, a judge has ruled that Google's Motorola can't ban the sales of the Xbox 360 over patent dispute.

933
01:09:56,536 --> 01:10:01,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, no one had any comment on it and the case moves on.

934
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's good and kind of what we thought would happen.

935
01:10:06,282 --> 01:10:14,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they would ban the sale over that, but... Yeah, can you imagine if they just suddenly pulled the Xbox 360 off of shelves?

936
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:21,570
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just gonna, you know, go through the courts right now and I'm sure at the end they're gonna settle or have to pay some sort of royalties or something.

937
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:24,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to, so we'll see.

938
01:10:25,072 --> 01:10:31,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to a game that once could have been, but it's not gonna be, Guitar Hero 7.

939
01:10:32,196 --> 01:10:34,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 7, at one point, it was going to happen.

940
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,541
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in development, but Activision canned it in 2011.

941
01:10:39,162 --> 01:10:44,326
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all coming from an anonymous source via Kotaku, so take it with a huge grain of salt.

942
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:46,688
[SPEAKER_08]: But it certainly sounds plausible.

943
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:51,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 7 was going back to the roots, meaning it was only going to use a guitar.

944
01:10:51,992 --> 01:10:54,974
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was going to lose the drums, the mic, and all that other stuff.

945
01:10:55,135 --> 01:10:58,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock Band kind of had the lock on that, so it was going to go back to just guitar.

946
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:00,161
[SPEAKER_08]: But the guitar was gonna go through some changes.

947
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:04,069
[SPEAKER_08]: A full six strings and an extra button in the neck.

948
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:07,013
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the guitar apparently was expensive.

949
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:09,394
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a disaster.

950
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:10,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Unresponsive.

951
01:11:11,474 --> 01:11:13,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was not going to be happening.

952
01:11:14,455 --> 01:11:16,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Vicarious Visions was the team that was developing it.

953
01:11:17,536 --> 01:11:22,318
[SPEAKER_08]: They were going to do this thing where the music video would actually change for each song.

954
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:29,381
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were trying to separate themselves from a rock band, which I applaud.

955
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:30,941
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

956
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:33,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess maybe this music video thing wasn't really working out.

957
01:11:34,682 --> 01:12:01,611
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe that would have been the theme, was like making music videos like MTV Apparently the songs were not that great either It was all the worst hits from the 1990s In other words, stuff like Closing Time and Sex and Candy Ugh, Closing Time The old, remember that's the old outro for this show I know, but But to tell you something else about that In magazine class last time we did it, not this semester but last year

958
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:08,166
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of every class, he would play that song right before we had our meeting.

959
01:12:09,288 --> 01:12:10,529
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what that song makes me think of.

960
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:14,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, some good conversation in chat.

961
01:12:14,492 --> 01:12:16,932
[SPEAKER_08]: VXJasonXV is like, why the jump to seven?

962
01:12:17,072 --> 01:12:23,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew there was Guitar Hero 4 and Orin G points out Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

963
01:12:23,393 --> 01:12:25,214
[SPEAKER_08]: So there were other games in between.

964
01:12:25,454 --> 01:12:27,194
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not even counting the spinoff games.

965
01:12:27,234 --> 01:12:28,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there was Band Hero.

966
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:32,235
[SPEAKER_08]: There was... Was that the Taylor Swift one was Band Hero?

967
01:12:32,275 --> 01:12:32,975
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the family hero?

968
01:12:32,995 --> 01:12:34,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Who gives a crap about Taylor Swift?

969
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying.

970
01:12:35,076 --> 01:12:36,756
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a... There was Band Hero and then...

971
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:39,393
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Hero for $20

972
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:08,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

973
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:11,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, the soundtrack is still awesome.

974
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:13,502
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a game that could have won it for the soundtrack.

975
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go back and play that game again.

976
01:13:15,663 --> 01:13:17,143
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some really good mixes in that game.

977
01:13:19,244 --> 01:13:20,144
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awfully sad.

978
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:27,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember a time when we didn't have seven versions of a particular game?

979
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:28,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we did.

980
01:13:28,686 --> 01:13:29,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it was Mega Man.

981
01:13:29,727 --> 01:13:31,267
[SPEAKER_11]: No, unless it was Street Fighter II.

982
01:13:31,963 --> 01:13:32,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, there is that.

983
01:13:33,003 --> 01:13:33,404
[SPEAKER_08]: There is that.

984
01:13:33,824 --> 01:13:35,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this game before or after Street Fighter 2?

985
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:43,488
[SPEAKER_08]: As we get into the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that is older or about the same age as Street Fighter 2.

986
01:13:43,528 --> 01:13:44,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Contemporary.

987
01:13:45,169 --> 01:13:48,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And say, hey, you should be playing this game this week, damn it.

988
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:50,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, damn it.

989
01:13:51,111 --> 01:13:55,113
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is another one that Dan picked out because I couldn't think of anything.

990
01:13:55,813 --> 01:13:56,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunset Riders.

991
01:13:57,334 --> 01:13:58,074
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good pick.

992
01:13:58,094 --> 01:13:59,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you ever play it?

993
01:13:59,675 --> 01:13:59,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

994
01:14:01,414 --> 01:14:04,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunset Ride, and you know, actually, I have played it.

995
01:14:05,337 --> 01:14:13,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I just was, the only place that had one was in an arcade, which was a tilt arcade in Dothan, Alabama, and then it was gone.

996
01:14:16,591 --> 01:14:19,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunset Riders is a side-scrolling game.

997
01:14:19,613 --> 01:14:23,355
[SPEAKER_11]: You basically run around and shoot guys with your guns.

998
01:14:23,616 --> 01:14:28,759
[SPEAKER_11]: You jump from back to back of stampeding cattle and ride horses.

999
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how the article says it's a fanciful Wild West.

1000
01:14:35,706 --> 01:14:38,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Outlaws in the West

1001
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:05,885
[SPEAKER_11]: and in between each day it shows you a wanted poster of whoever it is and your reward and wanted dead or alive.

1002
01:15:06,305 --> 01:15:07,106
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that type of thing.

1003
01:15:08,227 --> 01:15:27,502
[SPEAKER_11]: So you play as Steve and Billy and their guns are Peacemakers which are faster and then you have Bob and Cormano which I don't even know if that's a real name but I was laughing because he's wearing a pink poncho and they have a few shotguns so they have wider shots and

1004
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:45,545
[SPEAKER_11]: in the two player mode you actually can choose the character you want to control before you start the game but in four player each person is assigned to a character kind of like how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was just like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which is clearly the engine this game is using just saying

1005
01:15:47,822 --> 01:15:53,646
[SPEAKER_08]: This is definitely... They're trying to make Lightning Strike twice after that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.

1006
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:56,388
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clearly the same hardware, which is fine.

1007
01:15:56,408 --> 01:15:57,649
[SPEAKER_11]: But this game has hookers.

1008
01:15:58,469 --> 01:15:58,849
[SPEAKER_11]: See, look.

1009
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,991
[SPEAKER_08]: He goes in the room, and there's a hooker.

1010
01:16:01,131 --> 01:16:03,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had April O'Neil.

1011
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:03,973
[SPEAKER_11]: She wasn't a hooker.

1012
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:05,814
[SPEAKER_11]: She did have cleavage, though.

1013
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:07,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the pictures I've seen, she is.

1014
01:16:08,176 --> 01:16:09,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Clearly, you haven't been on Tumblr.

1015
01:16:10,377 --> 01:16:12,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, any... Whatever.

1016
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:14,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Dirty men.

1017
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone can be a hooker on Tumblr.

1018
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:15,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Dirty men.

1019
01:16:16,581 --> 01:16:17,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially Hawkeye.

1020
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:21,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, the Hawkeye Initiative is awesome.

1021
01:16:22,364 --> 01:16:28,067
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, you can jump from different floors, which use the joystick and jump, the usual thing.

1022
01:16:28,388 --> 01:16:30,989
[SPEAKER_11]: You can shoot downwards, diagonally, or vertically while crouching.

1023
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:36,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's basic run and gun controls for a game like this.

1024
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:42,899
[SPEAKER_11]: You have badge shaped power ups that you get by beating these guys carrying sacks.

1025
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:48,045
[SPEAKER_11]: The silver badge gives you a second gun so you can shoot in two directions at the same time.

1026
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:53,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And the gold badge lets you fire continuously when you hold down the shoot button.

1027
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:55,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can use both power ups together.

1028
01:16:57,194 --> 01:17:02,878
[SPEAKER_11]: There's eight stages and you basically have to reach the end of each stage and beat the bad guy and get your money.

1029
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:03,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeehaw.

1030
01:17:04,839 --> 01:17:08,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Although when I saw the first boss, I was asking Dan today, is he not wearing any pants?

1031
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:10,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it looked like he wasn't wearing pants.

1032
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was just the perspective in the game.

1033
01:17:13,824 --> 01:17:16,205
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan said that the only people not wearing pants were the hookers.

1034
01:17:17,406 --> 01:17:18,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And the cowgirl.

1035
01:17:18,627 --> 01:17:19,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And those chickens.

1036
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:20,168
[SPEAKER_11]: And the chickens.

1037
01:17:21,088 --> 01:17:22,189
[SPEAKER_11]: And the stampeding cattle.

1038
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:23,590
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not wearing pants either.

1039
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:25,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?

1040
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:29,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Horse, which just makes me think of Bad Horse in, um...

1041
01:17:54,971 --> 01:18:01,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Horrible The Smith Brothers El Greco Wouldn't that mean the Greek?

1042
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:05,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like Greco-Greek?

1043
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:05,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Spanish for Greek?

1044
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:07,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1045
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:08,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1046
01:18:08,513 --> 01:18:09,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Scalpem.

1047
01:18:10,254 --> 01:18:13,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Scalpem, which is... Oh, insensitive.

1048
01:18:13,915 --> 01:18:14,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Paco Loco.

1049
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:21,999
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sir Richard Rose, a Britishman who's shooting from the balcony behind two lions.

1050
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:27,602
[SPEAKER_11]: There were... I'm trying to find my favorite part, which is...

1051
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:31,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the stuff about the SNES version.

1052
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:32,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm going to get back into that.

1053
01:18:32,615 --> 01:18:34,737
[SPEAKER_11]: There were two major ports.

1054
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:44,384
[SPEAKER_11]: There was the Mega Drive version, which was a Sega Genesis, where it actually, two of the characters in the Genesis version were given surnames when they didn't have one.

1055
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:46,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Billy Cool and Cormano Wild.

1056
01:18:47,566 --> 01:18:49,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So they were Cool and Wild, apparently.

1057
01:18:49,928 --> 01:19:04,793
[SPEAKER_11]: and only four of the eight bosses were there so the four chapters were divided into two stages and the bosses in this version were Greedwell, Pakoloko, Scalpum and Richard Rose and the bounties were different they were increased depending on who it was

1058
01:19:06,393 --> 01:19:10,774
[SPEAKER_11]: and Genesis 1 had what looks like a two-player versus mode where you could fight each other in a gunfight.

1059
01:19:11,635 --> 01:19:14,736
[SPEAKER_11]: The SNES version had fewer changes.

1060
01:19:16,216 --> 01:19:31,441
[SPEAKER_11]: You could still play only up to two players at a time but it had all eight stages with their bosses and all the power-ups were the same but there were some different I would say censoring done.

1061
01:19:32,321 --> 01:19:35,042
[SPEAKER_11]: The whore that I'm just going to call her a whore, I don't care.

1062
01:19:35,402 --> 01:19:40,364
[SPEAKER_11]: She's supposed to be, I guess, like a bar girl, but she's totally done like an old west, you know, no-call girl.

1063
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:45,606
[SPEAKER_11]: She kisses the player in stage one and the saloon dancers in stage four.

1064
01:19:46,126 --> 01:19:48,087
[SPEAKER_11]: They're dressed more conservatively.

1065
01:19:48,267 --> 01:19:54,190
[SPEAKER_11]: The hunter dogs were taken out of the SNES version, but they were in the Genesis version.

1066
01:19:55,090 --> 01:20:02,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Native American enemies were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpum, who was renamed to Chief Wigwam.

1067
01:20:03,723 --> 01:20:05,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because that's just as good.

1068
01:20:06,205 --> 01:20:10,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Dynamite Tossing Female Bandits were taken out as well, but they were still in the Genesis version.

1069
01:20:12,651 --> 01:20:14,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, Sunset Riders.

1070
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:19,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I also think is funny, because you know how when you're reading the articles they have a C also?

1071
01:20:20,297 --> 01:20:23,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that it lists Wild West CAW Boys of Moo Mesa.

1072
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:26,362
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just wonderful.

1073
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:31,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the stage where you're going along the train shooting the bandits.

1074
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:33,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeehaw!

1075
01:20:34,911 --> 01:20:39,774
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you say that, and then you mentioned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and now I'm thinking, yeehaw, Ninja Cowboy.

1076
01:20:40,314 --> 01:20:43,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in chat, they were talking about Gunsmoke, the NES game.

1077
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,778
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, kind of like the other Western shooter game.

1078
01:20:46,118 --> 01:20:46,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1079
01:20:46,358 --> 01:20:47,699
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good game.

1080
01:20:47,779 --> 01:20:52,281
[SPEAKER_11]: See, Dan kept correcting me and saying Call Girl, and I'm like, it's a whore.

1081
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,003
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a whore.

1082
01:20:55,223 --> 01:20:55,824
[SPEAKER_11]: A whore.

1083
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:56,684
[SPEAKER_08]: She is a whore.

1084
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:58,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so my mom says, a whore.

1085
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:01,530
[SPEAKER_11]: She walks the night.

1086
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:02,670
[SPEAKER_11]: She is a tramp.

1087
01:21:06,472 --> 01:21:06,792
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

1088
01:21:06,812 --> 01:21:08,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Your classic game of the week.

1089
01:21:08,413 --> 01:21:09,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunset Riders.

1090
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:11,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And no, I'm not doing Mass Effect for classic game.

1091
01:21:11,614 --> 01:21:12,494
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not old enough yet.

1092
01:21:13,855 --> 01:21:14,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting there.

1093
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:16,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll classic game you.

1094
01:21:17,276 --> 01:21:17,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1095
01:21:17,657 --> 01:21:18,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like it's that old.

1096
01:21:19,597 --> 01:21:19,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

1097
01:21:19,898 --> 01:21:20,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, Mass Effect.

1098
01:21:20,998 --> 01:21:21,298
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1099
01:21:22,059 --> 01:21:23,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Games have to be at least ten years old.

1100
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:23,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1101
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, Fifth Dream.

1102
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,881
[SPEAKER_11]: My mom really actually does say it that way.

1103
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:27,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Hoomer.

1104
01:21:27,581 --> 01:21:27,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Hoomer.

1105
01:21:28,504 --> 01:21:28,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooer?

1106
01:21:29,948 --> 01:21:31,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my granddaddy said it that way.

1107
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,419
[SPEAKER_11]: My granddaddy was from Bridgeport, Connecticut and my mom's a southern girl.

1108
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,403
[SPEAKER_11]: So it translated to Hooer.

1109
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:38,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, enough whore talk.

1110
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:39,959
[SPEAKER_08]: More talk about the classic game of the week.

1111
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:40,920
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more whores!

1112
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunset Riot.

1113
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Whores need love too, only they charge for it.

1114
01:21:45,122 --> 01:21:46,463
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got plenty more show to come.

1115
01:21:46,723 --> 01:21:50,285
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk some Microsoft, Cloud Gaming, Idolmaster.

1116
01:21:50,525 --> 01:21:51,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Idolmaster.

1117
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:51,725
[SPEAKER_08]: And whores.

1118
01:21:52,406 --> 01:21:53,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some whores.

1119
01:21:53,947 --> 01:21:59,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some whores will call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.

1120
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,710
[SPEAKER_08]: That is our name on Skype.

1121
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,771
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be taking calls after the break.

1122
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,313
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, stay tuned.

1123
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:22,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, December the 9th of 2012 with the 485th episode of our show.

1124
01:22:22,322 --> 01:22:24,063
[SPEAKER_08]: We're about to get into rapid fire news.

1125
01:22:24,443 --> 01:22:28,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself and Loki here in the studio and DarkSakura in the kitchen.

1126
01:22:28,326 --> 01:22:30,367
[SPEAKER_08]: She volunteered.

1127
01:22:30,387 --> 01:22:30,788
[SPEAKER_08]: She's in there.

1128
01:22:30,808 --> 01:22:32,669
[SPEAKER_08]: She's making more latkes.

1129
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:38,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, you are not prepared for the mountain of latkes that are going to be here when you get home.

1130
01:22:38,773 --> 01:22:39,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you like potatoes.

1131
01:22:41,815 --> 01:22:42,456
[SPEAKER_08]: and Matza.

1132
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:43,297
[SPEAKER_08]: They're good though.

1133
01:22:43,657 --> 01:22:44,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Not gonna lie.

1134
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:45,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1135
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, while she finishes those up, we will get into some rapid fire news.

1136
01:22:49,445 --> 01:22:50,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta talk about this real quick though.

1137
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you play a lot of fighting games, Loki?

1138
01:22:53,931 --> 01:22:55,272
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't talk a lot about fighting games.

1139
01:22:55,292 --> 01:22:55,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you play a lot?

1140
01:22:56,213 --> 01:22:56,794
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

1141
01:22:56,834 --> 01:22:57,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really?

1142
01:22:57,615 --> 01:22:58,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever play Capcom vs. SNK 2?

1143
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:02,315
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1144
01:23:26,012 --> 01:23:26,672
[SPEAKER_08]: and what have you.

1145
01:23:26,913 --> 01:23:30,075
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys during the podcast don't get that, but we play some music.

1146
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:34,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And while the Capcom vs. SNK 2 song was playing, somebody in chat said, where was this?

1147
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,825
[SPEAKER_08]: SGO100Matt said, there isn't an HD remix of Capcom vs. SNK 2 coming out anytime soon, huh?

1148
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:43,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And it made me think, no, there's not.

1149
01:23:44,007 --> 01:23:48,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And that made me sad that there is no... Oh my god, that's a lot.

1150
01:23:48,531 --> 01:23:50,332
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you are making me so fat.

1151
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:52,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I am fat because of you.

1152
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:58,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, no HD version of it.

1153
01:23:58,969 --> 01:24:03,454
[SPEAKER_08]: For me to sit on my fat ass and eat latkes and play Capcom vs. SNK 2 HD.

1154
01:24:03,814 --> 01:24:05,176
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just not happening.

1155
01:24:06,516 --> 01:24:06,896
[SPEAKER_06]: King of Fighters

1156
01:24:27,516 --> 01:24:33,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so... I mean, I would imagine that Atlas would work with them.

1157
01:24:34,019 --> 01:24:41,982
[SPEAKER_06]: After all, I don't know if you guys know this, Persona 4 Arena, best fighting game, which is very unusual.

1158
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:53,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you would think that that might go to, like, Street Fighter X Tekken or something like that, or even... I don't know if it's too late, but PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or something like that.

1159
01:24:53,647 --> 01:24:56,008
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, definitely going a little bit more niche with...

1160
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:58,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's winning these things?

1161
01:24:58,429 --> 01:24:59,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

1162
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:02,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sometimes the Oscars don't always go to the big budget movies.

1163
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:03,893
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, they often don't.

1164
01:25:04,073 --> 01:25:04,974
[SPEAKER_08]: They go to the niche stuff.

1165
01:25:05,854 --> 01:25:07,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the VGA is taking a nod from that.

1166
01:25:07,415 --> 01:25:07,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1167
01:25:08,476 --> 01:25:09,016
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

1168
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:10,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1169
01:25:10,517 --> 01:25:13,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Chatters are complaining that they are not getting latkes.

1170
01:25:15,481 --> 01:25:15,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Come over.

1171
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:21,540
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's yelling from the kitchen, make your own damn latkes.

1172
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:24,282
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's gonna set off the smoke alarm, watch.

1173
01:25:25,482 --> 01:25:26,423
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over, no, it's over here.

1174
01:25:28,144 --> 01:25:28,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good idea.

1175
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:31,085
[SPEAKER_08]: The last thing we need.

1176
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:40,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say, that's one thing that hasn't happened in 11 years of Orange Launch Radio is that we've had to evacuate.

1177
01:25:41,826 --> 01:25:45,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I've subbed the smoke alarm before when drinking bacon late at night.

1178
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:51,393
[SPEAKER_06]: But then we had the smoke alarm defense system where the giant fan aimed at the smoke alarm.

1179
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:53,075
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had the power go out.

1180
01:25:53,575 --> 01:25:55,517
[SPEAKER_08]: We've passed out drunk during the show.

1181
01:25:55,837 --> 01:25:57,298
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never had to evacuate.

1182
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that's true.

1183
01:26:00,941 --> 01:26:02,362
[SPEAKER_08]: We lost the soundboard.

1184
01:26:03,703 --> 01:26:04,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyway.

1185
01:26:04,984 --> 01:26:07,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some rapid fire news.

1186
01:26:08,286 --> 01:26:09,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Some quick news stories for you guys.

1187
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, starting us off.

1188
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:15,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Minecraft's getting another update, as they tend to do.

1189
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:19,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we know the big update, the Redstone update, is coming in January.

1190
01:26:19,594 --> 01:26:21,696
[SPEAKER_06]: But until then, they're going to get some smaller updates.

1191
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:23,697
[SPEAKER_06]: 1.46 is going to be the next one.

1192
01:26:24,117 --> 01:26:28,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the things you can expect for 1.46 that are actually available right now on Snapshot 12w49a include...

1193
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:33,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Fireworks!

1194
01:26:33,991 --> 01:26:38,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's only, I don't know, five months late, but fireworks are getting added in.

1195
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:41,074
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually craft different colored fireworks.

1196
01:26:41,274 --> 01:26:47,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Fireworks that sparkle, fireworks that go higher, lower, and even fireworks that are shaped like creepers.

1197
01:26:48,397 --> 01:26:57,404
[SPEAKER_06]: and then also there's supposed to be a book that you can use to enchant items and of course other bug fixes and stuff.

1198
01:26:57,864 --> 01:27:03,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But 1.46 is supposed to be released sometime before Christmas, so next week or so.

1199
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:07,872
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who I found out today plays Minecraft?

1200
01:27:08,913 --> 01:27:09,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Who?

1201
01:27:09,093 --> 01:27:10,274
[SPEAKER_08]: My nine-year-old cousin.

1202
01:27:12,759 --> 01:27:13,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was interesting.

1203
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,442
[SPEAKER_06]: You can join the VOG Network.

1204
01:27:18,022 --> 01:27:18,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't trust that.

1205
01:27:18,863 --> 01:27:26,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We seriously had someone join this week, and they're like, is there seriously no one on here all the time?

1206
01:27:26,628 --> 01:27:28,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm on here.

1207
01:27:28,849 --> 01:27:36,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And his mom was telling me, do you know how many viruses we've gotten on our computer because he keeps trying to find a free version of Minecraft?

1208
01:27:37,142 --> 01:28:06,689
[SPEAKER_08]: there is no such thing as a free version of Minecraft they're all viruses we had to kind of explain that because it's like yeah you have to log in with your account and all that stuff you can play on cracked servers is the only way he can get around that I said you can do the free version that doesn't have all the I mean he's 9 he's not going to miss all that stuff although he was asking me he's like have you ever built a nether portal I'm like no a 9 year old just kicked my ass at a video game

1209
01:28:08,646 --> 01:28:11,087
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't have to, because we did it all for you.

1210
01:28:11,107 --> 01:28:12,108
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like 50 of them.

1211
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:13,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1212
01:28:14,429 --> 01:28:18,131
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so The Last of Us was revealed to be coming out May 7th.

1213
01:28:18,151 --> 01:28:20,673
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming from the trailer that played during the VGAs.

1214
01:28:21,373 --> 01:28:23,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So yay, another game.

1215
01:28:24,695 --> 01:28:32,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, in the realm of I don't give a shit about this, but we're going to report it anyways because originally it had something to do with gaming, but now it's so far away from gaming.

1216
01:28:33,519 --> 01:28:37,821
[SPEAKER_06]: G4, or what used to be G4, is now becoming the Esquire Channel.

1217
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:40,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I could really care less about that.

1218
01:28:40,302 --> 01:28:43,583
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I do care as little about that as possible.

1219
01:28:44,044 --> 01:28:49,326
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently it is a network that is going to be aimed at the metrosexual male community.

1220
01:28:49,386 --> 01:28:49,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Fashion, Cooking, Travel

1221
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:12,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Vomit is what I say.

1222
01:29:13,538 --> 01:29:14,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1223
01:29:14,899 --> 01:29:18,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope this crashes and burns pretty fast.

1224
01:29:18,939 --> 01:29:20,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I think it will.

1225
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,040
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, do you think metrosexual is hot?

1226
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever that's supposed to mean anyway.

1227
01:29:25,221 --> 01:29:25,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

1228
01:29:26,141 --> 01:29:26,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Metrosexual?

1229
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:28,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, and I'm like, huh?

1230
01:29:29,061 --> 01:29:29,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to know, though.

1231
01:29:29,941 --> 01:29:31,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it authentic.

1232
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:34,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know, are they going to be running reruns of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?

1233
01:29:34,222 --> 01:29:36,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's pretty metrosexual right there.

1234
01:29:37,363 --> 01:29:38,243
[SPEAKER_06]: They should reboot it.

1235
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:40,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, what was Alan telling you?

1236
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So... No, that's fine.

1237
01:29:58,471 --> 01:29:59,231
[SPEAKER_08]: He listens to mine too.

1238
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:01,812
[SPEAKER_08]: But he likes to listen to... He's probably listening now, in fact.

1239
01:30:02,872 --> 01:30:04,613
[SPEAKER_08]: He likes to listen to The Nerdist with Chris Harwick.

1240
01:30:04,633 --> 01:30:13,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess they've been doing a lot of... Because I guess somebody involved with that show is involved with Attack of the Show right now after Kevin Pereira left and all that.

1241
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:17,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess they say that this network is supposed to be Brovo.

1242
01:30:18,078 --> 01:30:19,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Is what they're calling it.

1243
01:30:19,078 --> 01:30:19,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Brovo?

1244
01:30:19,819 --> 01:30:21,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of Bravo, it's Brovo.

1245
01:30:21,799 --> 01:30:22,380
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm like...

1246
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,241
[SPEAKER_08]: The real dude bros of Orange County?

1247
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:26,522
[SPEAKER_08]: What exactly does that mean?

1248
01:30:26,642 --> 01:30:28,424
[SPEAKER_08]: What is real dude bros?

1249
01:30:28,984 --> 01:30:30,625
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty hilarious.

1250
01:30:30,645 --> 01:30:32,766
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually would be a fucking awesome show.

1251
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:34,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

1252
01:30:34,508 --> 01:30:35,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

1253
01:30:35,088 --> 01:30:36,569
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you gonna do, man?

1254
01:30:36,589 --> 01:30:36,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

1255
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:45,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's there for dudes of, you know... Fist bump, Loki, fist bump!

1256
01:30:45,635 --> 01:30:46,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Fist bump, yeah!

1257
01:30:52,276 --> 01:30:53,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1258
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,124
[SPEAKER_08]: An update to the Humble Bundle.

1259
01:30:57,484 --> 01:30:59,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you ever fist bump people, DarkSakura?

1260
01:30:59,507 --> 01:31:00,048
[SPEAKER_09]: All the time.

1261
01:31:03,053 --> 01:31:05,817
[SPEAKER_08]: The Humble THQ Bundle has added...

1262
01:31:06,892 --> 01:31:07,312
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

1263
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:33,873
[SPEAKER_08]: The Humble THQ Bundle By the way, you don't have to re-buy the bundle to get those games.

1264
01:31:34,013 --> 01:31:38,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Just log back in to the Humble Bundle site or reuse your code, whatever.

1265
01:31:39,215 --> 01:31:39,876
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get the games.

1266
01:31:39,896 --> 01:31:42,357
[SPEAKER_08]: $2 million earned in 24 hours.

1267
01:31:45,358 --> 01:32:08,156
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 days to go actually no that was 3 days left about 3.7 million made so it's probably up to about 4 million by now the average price of the bundle $5.58 and as the article here points out 4.5 shares of THQ stock same price amazing

1268
01:32:09,986 --> 01:32:17,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know this was a thing, but more import games apparently still coming to the PlayStation Store in the form of PlayStation 1 Classics.

1269
01:32:18,429 --> 01:32:26,571
[SPEAKER_08]: And GungHo Online America getting these old Japanese-only games and repackaging them for the PlayStation 1 Import Store.

1270
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:27,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great idea.

1271
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:38,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I'd play any of these games, but Zanuck x Zanuck, Kendo Rage sequel Makeruna Makendo 2,

1272
01:32:39,715 --> 01:32:59,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Vehicle Cavalier, which was a vehicle combat game with mechs, Art Kamien Sugoro Kuden, that was a board game about Dekotora trucks in Japan, and Loop Salad, which was a match-three puzzle game, and Finger Flashing, which was basically a rock-paper-scissors action game.

1273
01:32:59,832 --> 01:33:00,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Naked Fingers?

1274
01:33:01,113 --> 01:33:01,313
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1275
01:33:01,713 --> 01:33:02,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Finger Flashing.

1276
01:33:03,054 --> 01:33:03,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that.

1277
01:33:03,575 --> 01:33:03,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1278
01:33:04,916 --> 01:33:08,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I just flashed one of my fingers at DarkSakura.

1279
01:33:08,938 --> 01:33:10,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I retorted only to be polite.

1280
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:14,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Streets of Rage apparently at one point had a remake.

1281
01:33:14,782 --> 01:33:19,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what kind of stage this concept was in.

1282
01:33:19,445 --> 01:33:21,407
[SPEAKER_08]: This could even be a fan thing for all we know.

1283
01:33:21,866 --> 01:33:22,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1284
01:33:38,272 --> 01:34:06,540
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a little more open world than side scroller but it has that very neon look to it and you can watch the guys beating each other up there in the video Ubisoft level designer Sean Noonan that was the guy that leaked it through Twitter it was reportedly in development I'm sorry, he confirmed the leak through Twitter he didn't leak it himself reportedly was in development at Ruffian Games there was supposed to be destructible environments takedowns, street gangs

1285
01:34:08,092 --> 01:34:09,073
[SPEAKER_08]: But cancelled.

1286
01:34:10,294 --> 01:34:10,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Not happening.

1287
01:34:13,737 --> 01:34:14,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess it just wasn't good enough.

1288
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:16,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Some things are not meant to be.

1289
01:34:19,401 --> 01:34:22,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for my rapid fire news.

1290
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:29,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now, did you ever have a TI calculator?

1291
01:34:29,709 --> 01:34:30,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I sure did.

1292
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:31,211
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphing calculators?

1293
01:34:31,271 --> 01:34:32,772
[SPEAKER_08]: In AP Calculus, I sure did.

1294
01:34:33,174 --> 01:34:34,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I didn't take Calculus.

1295
01:34:34,475 --> 01:34:36,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I had one just so I could play Pole Position.

1296
01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:38,257
[SPEAKER_11]: And then make it say rude things.

1297
01:34:38,337 --> 01:34:41,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on my way to take Calculus, and I was in pre-calc.

1298
01:34:41,139 --> 01:34:43,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I spent too much time programming on my calculator.

1299
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:48,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game, but... And now we have Dissidia.

1300
01:34:48,604 --> 01:34:49,104
[SPEAKER_06]: You should sue.

1301
01:34:49,124 --> 01:34:49,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to quit.

1302
01:34:50,665 --> 01:34:55,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now they've made Portal on a TI-85 calculator.

1303
01:34:56,408 --> 01:35:00,031
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually play kind of a weird version of Portal where...

1304
01:35:01,969 --> 01:35:07,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's like the Flash one, where it's just sort of from the side.

1305
01:35:07,976 --> 01:35:11,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't really tell, the video was not playing on my network.

1306
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:21,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was from the side, and you could shoot portals out in like eight directions, and they actually had puzzles and a little bit of a story that goes along, so it was pretty cool.

1307
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:23,341
[SPEAKER_11]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE NEXT SPRING

1308
01:35:47,052 --> 01:35:48,914
[SPEAKER_11]: They will be seeing it.

1309
01:35:49,414 --> 01:35:51,616
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of the Greenlight titles and I have it.

1310
01:35:51,696 --> 01:35:52,437
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty.

1311
01:35:52,697 --> 01:35:54,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't really gotten a chance to play much of it.

1312
01:35:55,299 --> 01:35:57,962
[SPEAKER_11]: But we shall be seeing it on Xbox.

1313
01:35:59,343 --> 01:35:59,643
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1314
01:36:00,644 --> 01:36:02,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's cool that it made its way to Xbox.

1315
01:36:03,146 --> 01:36:04,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, not bad for Kickstarter, huh?

1316
01:36:04,888 --> 01:36:05,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1317
01:36:05,657 --> 01:36:07,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fantastic game that I have yet to play.

1318
01:36:08,819 --> 01:36:09,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

1319
01:36:09,599 --> 01:36:10,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

1320
01:36:10,119 --> 01:36:10,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it too.

1321
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:14,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it because I backed the Kickstarter, but I haven't played it yet.

1322
01:36:17,523 --> 01:36:26,788
[SPEAKER_08]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase cereal, as in breakfast cereal.

1323
01:36:27,549 --> 01:36:29,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1324
01:36:37,222 --> 01:36:41,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook and Google+.

1325
01:36:41,464 --> 01:36:44,746
[SPEAKER_08]: You smoosh it together, that's Foogle.

1326
01:36:44,926 --> 01:36:48,968
[SPEAKER_08]: This week I was kind of a goober and I forgot to post the question in a timely manner.

1327
01:36:49,528 --> 01:36:53,670
[SPEAKER_08]: So as soon as I joined chat they were like, Rob, you have not posted the Foogle question of the week.

1328
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:54,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't!

1329
01:36:54,871 --> 01:36:55,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't!

1330
01:36:55,551 --> 01:37:00,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of our chatters, Ragenator, just said, here, I'm going to give you a question totally free of charge.

1331
01:37:00,796 --> 01:37:01,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, okay.

1332
01:37:02,097 --> 01:37:04,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Ragenator's asking the Google question this week.

1333
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:10,205
[SPEAKER_08]: What is one thing that you learned, in quotes, from video games over the years?

1334
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:11,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was a good question.

1335
01:37:11,806 --> 01:37:12,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

1336
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:14,969
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

1337
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:17,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So if one of you wants to ask the question tonight...

1338
01:37:18,092 --> 01:37:18,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

1339
01:37:19,132 --> 01:37:20,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was a great idea.

1340
01:37:20,093 --> 01:37:21,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see what the listeners said.

1341
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:26,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start tonight on Google+.

1342
01:37:26,995 --> 01:37:28,576
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a couple answers on Google+.

1343
01:37:29,936 --> 01:37:35,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Redertainment says, Before Assassin's Creed, I didn't know Leonardo da Vinci was gay.

1344
01:37:36,259 --> 01:37:38,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.

1345
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't...

1346
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:43,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that true, or is that just a stereotype thing in the game?

1347
01:37:44,184 --> 01:37:45,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a speculation.

1348
01:37:46,146 --> 01:37:46,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

1349
01:37:46,987 --> 01:37:50,350
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, you know, that type of thing was punishable by death back then.

1350
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:51,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunate.

1351
01:37:52,312 --> 01:37:53,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft has an answer.

1352
01:37:54,554 --> 01:37:54,914
[SPEAKER_08]: English.

1353
01:37:55,655 --> 01:37:59,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I learned the language when I was little, but video games helped me master it.

1354
01:37:59,619 --> 01:38:01,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite probably the reason I have a B.A.

1355
01:38:01,861 --> 01:38:03,142
[SPEAKER_08]: in translation, too.

1356
01:38:04,107 --> 01:38:05,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's... I hate it.

1357
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:35,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate music, Actdeft goes on to say.

1358
01:38:35,902 --> 01:38:43,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I love music and video games helped me appreciate all kinds of music during my early years and especially during my teens.

1359
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:51,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Without that, probably I wouldn't be doing I love that music, which is a segment on VOGnetwork.com today.

1360
01:38:52,157 --> 01:38:54,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned lots of trivial things too, but those two are the most important.

1361
01:38:56,021 --> 01:38:57,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answers over there on Google+.

1362
01:38:58,083 --> 01:38:58,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's try Facebook.

1363
01:38:59,245 --> 01:39:00,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite a few answers on Facebook.

1364
01:39:01,347 --> 01:39:03,670
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all pretty short, so I'll try to read as many of these as I can.

1365
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:05,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Reginator answered his own question.

1366
01:39:06,513 --> 01:39:14,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned that, quote, herbs, quote, are good for your health, and I think those in Washington State would be inclined to agree.

1367
01:39:15,122 --> 01:39:16,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I see the joke there.

1368
01:39:16,804 --> 01:39:23,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really, though, there were a lot of, speaking of early RPGs, it was always the herb that would suddenly make you feel better and just make you forget all the pain.

1369
01:39:23,951 --> 01:39:31,979
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to say when you mix the brown, sorry, the red herb and the green herb and you got the brown pile, we would just call it the brown pile or crap.

1370
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:35,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you mix the green herb and the pink herb and suddenly you want to watch a lot of My Little Pony.

1371
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:36,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I figure.

1372
01:39:37,426 --> 01:39:39,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing will make me want to watch a lot of My Little Pony, Rob.

1373
01:39:41,567 --> 01:39:45,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Brandon H. on Facebook said, Don't try to text in the middle of a race.

1374
01:39:46,408 --> 01:39:52,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that means Mario Kart or like an actual race, but just don't text and drive, kids.

1375
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:53,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't even work in games.

1376
01:39:55,690 --> 01:40:01,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Katsuhiko J. replied and said, Save your game, save often.

1377
01:40:01,611 --> 01:40:02,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Ain't that the truth?

1378
01:40:03,843 --> 01:40:08,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely you've lost progress in Mass Effect due to lack of saving, yes, DarkSakura?

1379
01:40:09,168 --> 01:40:10,909
[SPEAKER_11]: No, actually, because I save often.

1380
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:12,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you learned that lesson, huh?

1381
01:40:13,231 --> 01:40:14,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have multiple saves at the same place.

1382
01:40:15,013 --> 01:40:19,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I have different colors of skin and hair and different hairstyles and eye colors on my Shepard.

1383
01:40:19,557 --> 01:40:19,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Nerd.

1384
01:40:20,537 --> 01:40:26,182
[SPEAKER_08]: GamerGirl replied and said, Keep calm and keep playing because nothing in a game is as bad as real life.

1385
01:40:26,623 --> 01:40:31,227
[SPEAKER_08]: At least, unlike life, in a game, there are do-overs and extra lives.

1386
01:40:32,594 --> 01:40:32,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1387
01:40:32,734 --> 01:40:32,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1388
01:40:32,814 --> 01:40:32,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1389
01:41:00,543 --> 01:41:01,544
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the first law of physics?

1390
01:41:01,564 --> 01:41:05,347
[SPEAKER_11]: An object in motion tends to stay in motion, sir.

1391
01:41:21,761 --> 01:41:22,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I just forgot.

1392
01:41:48,632 --> 01:41:51,934
[SPEAKER_08]: BroSiden, I wonder if he'll have a show on Brovo.

1393
01:41:52,255 --> 01:42:02,842
[SPEAKER_08]: BroSiden answers and says, don't ever think you're better than the game because the game decides if you're going to win or if it might just freeze and glitch and make your past 36 hours pointless.

1394
01:42:03,523 --> 01:42:07,666
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to see the rule earlier, BroSiden, that says save now, save often.

1395
01:42:08,972 --> 01:42:17,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Giovedea says, I've learned that when trying to perform operations on the Wii in Trauma Center, it is oftentimes easier to operate while drunk.

1396
01:42:17,895 --> 01:42:20,136
[SPEAKER_08]: This makes me question real doctors.

1397
01:42:20,976 --> 01:42:23,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, because Trauma Center is real life.

1398
01:42:23,697 --> 01:42:27,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Your real doctors draw a pentagram shape in order to invoke the magic.

1399
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:34,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Burr replied and said, I learned you only live once.

1400
01:42:35,294 --> 01:42:35,815
[SPEAKER_08]: YOLO.

1401
01:42:37,096 --> 01:42:38,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, that can't be right.

1402
01:42:38,918 --> 01:42:40,740
[SPEAKER_08]: You missed the one on the three lives.

1403
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:41,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

1404
01:42:43,362 --> 01:42:46,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Cram replied and said, save often.

1405
01:42:46,684 --> 01:42:50,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Having to replay several hours can leave a game unfinished for a long time.

1406
01:42:51,788 --> 01:42:59,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Loco Poco replied and said, I've learned that flashing your breasts to your opponent is the best kind of fatality to finish them off.

1407
01:42:59,793 --> 01:43:02,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Learned from Black Orchid and Killer Instinct.

1408
01:43:04,997 --> 01:43:06,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a good life lesson, DarkSakura?

1409
01:43:06,878 --> 01:43:09,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you flash your breasts at opponents to kill them off?

1410
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I flash them at Dan to get him to shut up.

1411
01:43:15,909 --> 01:43:22,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Silent Tom replies and says, I've learned over the years that the princess is always in another castle.

1412
01:43:23,971 --> 01:43:26,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you chop down enough grass, you're bound to find money.

1413
01:43:27,592 --> 01:43:29,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are both good life lessons, wouldn't you say?

1414
01:43:31,053 --> 01:43:36,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Haseo Sumerugawa replies and says, If the camera focuses on it, it's important.

1415
01:43:37,374 --> 01:43:37,934
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

1416
01:43:38,074 --> 01:43:40,815
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Dead or Alive, the breasts are important.

1417
01:43:40,835 --> 01:43:40,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1418
01:43:42,287 --> 01:43:48,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and you can find our community on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.

1419
01:43:48,909 --> 01:43:50,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I did learn something by the way.

1420
01:43:50,329 --> 01:43:51,529
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good question Ragenator.

1421
01:43:51,629 --> 01:43:51,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

1422
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:53,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned something last night Rob.

1423
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:57,611
[SPEAKER_11]: My hacked Mass Effect 3 will now work in multiplayer.

1424
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:00,311
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as I don't hit the button.

1425
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:02,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh you.

1426
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1427
01:44:04,713 --> 01:44:05,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more news.

1428
01:44:06,093 --> 01:44:06,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1429
01:44:07,256 --> 01:44:17,258
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's been a listing on LinkedIn, their one ads for, I guess, Microsoft's interactive entertainment business studio, Soho.

1430
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:22,460
[SPEAKER_06]: They're seeking a television producer to develop and deliver a number of new TV products.

1431
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:27,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it says, Soho Productions is pushing the boundaries of Kinect

1432
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1433
01:44:51,773 --> 01:44:55,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So this kind of goes back to a few different rumors.

1434
01:44:55,915 --> 01:45:03,199
[SPEAKER_06]: One, that this might be something that's incorporated into the next Xbox system, and also to that whole set-top box thing that they're going to be putting out.

1435
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:16,106
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, it sounds like they're kind of building on the whole Connect TV stuff, like what they did with Sesame Street and Nat Geo, that they're going to be doing some other types of...

1436
01:45:16,926 --> 01:45:22,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Interactive TV things, maybe bringing back 1 vs 100 or something like that might be kind of cool.

1437
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:31,433
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what it sounds like to me, or maybe it's just something else, but hopefully it's not implemented really stupid like...

1438
01:45:32,213 --> 01:45:37,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you can vote on this, you know, thing or something.

1439
01:45:37,534 --> 01:45:39,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like Xbox or not?

1440
01:45:39,075 --> 01:45:45,056
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think they were doing something similar for the Spike VGAs where they had it where you can stream it and interact with TV and stuff.

1441
01:45:45,136 --> 01:45:46,777
[SPEAKER_08]: They were doing it for the political debates.

1442
01:45:47,277 --> 01:45:47,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1443
01:45:47,777 --> 01:45:48,457
[SPEAKER_06]: On Xbox Live.

1444
01:45:48,477 --> 01:45:51,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe they're going to be kind of doing something like that.

1445
01:45:51,838 --> 01:45:56,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like the way that they would go, but they're trying to maybe new content, which would be cool.

1446
01:45:56,439 --> 01:46:01,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all for new content, especially if it's not any additional cost to me.

1447
01:46:02,839 --> 01:46:13,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think we've known for a while that they're toying with the idea of doing like a Microsoft channel type of thing on Xbox or at least, you know, I don't know, more of that interactive kind of television style content.

1448
01:46:13,965 --> 01:46:20,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Although it does seem weird that why would they close inside Xbox only to develop that kind of stuff?

1449
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:21,629
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the weird part.

1450
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:22,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1451
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:26,032
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think definitely something is in the works there.

1452
01:46:28,351 --> 01:46:29,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that interests you, Loki?

1453
01:46:30,474 --> 01:46:42,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, if it's at no additional cost to me, because I don't pay for cable TV right now, but I do pay for Xbox Live Gold, so it'd be nice if that was included with it.

1454
01:46:43,709 --> 01:46:45,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd probably watch some stuff on there.

1455
01:46:46,877 --> 01:46:50,879
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, going to a service called Playcast.

1456
01:46:51,519 --> 01:46:56,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Playcast is an Israel-based company, and they're a cloud gaming service.

1457
01:46:57,242 --> 01:46:58,863
[SPEAKER_08]: You can think similar to OnLive.

1458
01:46:59,243 --> 01:47:05,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Playcast is live in Portugal, France, and South Korea, which is weird because they're Israel-based, but they're in these other countries.

1459
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:10,208
[SPEAKER_08]: But they are supposed to be launching the service in the United States early next year.

1460
01:47:10,728 --> 01:47:11,849
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cloud service.

1461
01:47:11,929 --> 01:47:16,011
[SPEAKER_08]: It streams through set-top boxes, tablets, smartphones, and PCs.

1462
01:47:16,591 --> 01:47:20,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything that can run Android 4.0 and higher.

1463
01:47:20,594 --> 01:47:24,376
[SPEAKER_08]: You do a subscription package that's tailored to a user.

1464
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:25,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of interesting.

1465
01:47:25,777 --> 01:47:32,962
[SPEAKER_08]: So like in the service in France right now, there's a package that's more tailored to casual gamers and then one that's tailored at the more hardcore.

1466
01:47:32,982 --> 01:47:38,606
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of like you would, I guess since we're talking about TVs and channels, you'd be buying like Comcast, right?

1467
01:47:39,066 --> 01:47:46,151
[SPEAKER_08]: When you sign up for their service, you can get like the sports channel package or the entertainment channel package or whatever, movie channels.

1468
01:47:46,611 --> 01:47:49,792
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of taking that idea to cloud gaming service.

1469
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:51,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1470
01:47:52,294 --> 01:47:52,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1471
01:47:53,514 --> 01:48:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Playcast is aiming towards what they call the mid-core market, a group that enjoys gaming but isn't going online in their favorite shooter every day.

1472
01:48:01,878 --> 01:48:07,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe not the type of people that listen to this show, but people that still enjoy gaming.

1473
01:48:09,245 --> 01:48:37,357
[SPEAKER_08]: apparently if you use multiple devices so like let's say you play on your TV through a PC and then you can now use your phone or tablet as a controller Playcast will instantly recognize the activity when you sign in with the auxiliary device you can create your own skins with the tablet or what have you and customize the look and layout of the interface no word on exactly when this launches in the US of course nothing on subscription prices da da da da da

1474
01:48:37,697 --> 01:48:38,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1475
01:48:38,057 --> 01:48:38,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1476
01:49:00,974 --> 01:49:29,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know I'm not super big on these cloud gaming things and I'm more of the type of gamer where it's like I'll just buy the games I want to play but I can see the idea of you know go after the audience that maybe isn't as hardcore as I am I just don't want to put stuff that I'm paying for in somebody else's hands yeah it depends on the price though if it were super cheap it might be awesome but I kind of doubt it's going to be that cheap Dark Sakura

1477
01:49:30,629 --> 01:49:31,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have.

1478
01:49:36,135 --> 01:49:40,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is a... I've been reading Japanese release dates for how long on this show?

1479
01:49:40,799 --> 01:49:41,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1480
01:49:41,059 --> 01:49:42,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I've heard of Idolmaster.

1481
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:44,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, it's called leading into a story.

1482
01:49:44,242 --> 01:49:44,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

1483
01:49:44,662 --> 01:49:45,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my bad, my bad.

1484
01:49:45,743 --> 01:49:51,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, Namco Bondi registered two different trademarks in Europe.

1485
01:49:52,348 --> 01:50:00,455
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them is the Idolmaster and the other is Shiny Festa, which is one of the titles of a recent Idolmaster spinoff that's on the PSP.

1486
01:50:01,776 --> 01:50:28,691
[SPEAKER_11]: so maybe we'll be getting Idolmaster I mean that looks like they're going to Europe first but I honestly think that if they did it there they'd do it here don't you think so I mean and really what this says um the the Idolmaster games you basically manage a pop star's career sort of like a Tamagotchi game Shiny Festa is just a rhythm game that sort of follows after Project D.Va

1487
01:50:29,226 --> 01:50:30,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have to clean up their poop too?

1488
01:50:30,946 --> 01:50:33,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Tamagotchi?

1489
01:50:34,727 --> 01:50:35,808
[SPEAKER_11]: You have not taken a bath.

1490
01:50:35,988 --> 01:50:36,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Go bathe.

1491
01:50:37,768 --> 01:50:39,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1492
01:50:40,209 --> 01:50:40,349
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1493
01:50:40,709 --> 01:50:41,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Bathe slower.

1494
01:50:42,569 --> 01:50:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Slower.

1495
01:50:43,409 --> 01:50:43,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Rub.

1496
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:44,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And hence.

1497
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:46,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And hence.

1498
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:46,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1499
01:50:47,791 --> 01:50:48,851
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it could get localized.

1500
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty, well, we'll see.

1501
01:50:54,811 --> 01:50:55,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

1502
01:50:55,991 --> 01:51:05,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Trademark may not, I mean, it may just be preventing another company from coming in and releasing their own game called Idolmaster, but I don't know.

1503
01:51:05,837 --> 01:51:07,698
[SPEAKER_08]: You would think there'd be an audience for it here.

1504
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:18,364
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be a huge thing like it is over there, but there's certainly enough people that are into the Japanese culture alone that would want to check it out just because it's been so big over there.

1505
01:51:18,384 --> 01:51:22,787
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be a cult game, I think is what they'd call it.

1506
01:51:23,464 --> 01:51:23,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1507
01:51:24,165 --> 01:51:28,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we've seen other things happen, you know, games like that gain popularity.

1508
01:51:28,892 --> 01:51:30,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, would we have had Elite Beat Agents otherwise?

1509
01:51:31,796 --> 01:51:31,916
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

1510
01:51:33,849 --> 01:51:34,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Be neat.

1511
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:35,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1512
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:35,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my thing.

1513
01:51:38,233 --> 01:51:39,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of funny.

1514
01:51:39,413 --> 01:51:43,417
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking a little bit about Killer Instinct and boot flashing, so that's awesome.

1515
01:51:43,897 --> 01:51:48,741
[SPEAKER_06]: But this may stop another Killer Instinct game coming out.

1516
01:51:49,121 --> 01:51:59,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently Microsoft at least tried to renew the trademark of Killer Instinct, but it's been rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

1517
01:52:00,456 --> 01:52:02,778
[SPEAKER_06]: on the basis of likelihood of confusion.

1518
01:52:03,438 --> 01:52:09,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, this has to do with a short-lived Fox show called Killer Instinct from 1995.

1519
01:52:10,563 --> 01:52:16,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know everybody that you talk about Killer Instinct thinks of the Fox show and not, I don't know, the fighting game series.

1520
01:52:16,908 --> 01:52:18,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never heard of that show.

1521
01:52:18,309 --> 01:52:20,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody at the trademark office did.

1522
01:52:21,231 --> 01:52:25,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a really obscure person that probably, you know, that's my favorite show!

1523
01:52:26,495 --> 01:52:29,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Same person probably also has episodes of Silk Stockings on tape.

1524
01:52:32,093 --> 01:52:35,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Silk Stockings was awesome That was some good Skinamax right there

1525
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:42,432
[SPEAKER_06]: and David Duchovny, you rock on.

1526
01:52:42,572 --> 01:52:52,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically they said that they're probably going to be trying to maybe appeal that or something.

1527
01:52:52,238 --> 01:52:52,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1528
01:52:53,999 --> 01:52:59,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now they said this happens to a lot of trademark applications and by no means is the final say on the application.

1529
01:52:59,602 --> 01:53:03,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It just means that Microsoft has to provide more evidence to overcome their objection.

1530
01:53:04,258 --> 01:53:06,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say, you know, ask the average person on the street.

1531
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:11,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Killer Instinct, is that an arcade game or a show from 1995?

1532
01:53:11,142 --> 01:53:12,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll be like, what?

1533
01:53:14,924 --> 01:53:22,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at some clips of Killer Instinct here on, I'm thinking this is the intro to the show or whatever, here on good old YouTube.

1534
01:53:23,148 --> 01:53:24,489
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, this is the movie.

1535
01:53:24,509 --> 01:53:26,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Who does it star?

1536
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:27,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Marguerite Moreau.

1537
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:32,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... It's a lot of nothing in...

1538
01:53:33,939 --> 01:53:34,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss her too.

1539
01:53:35,819 --> 01:53:41,960
[SPEAKER_06]: That's... Totally... What?

1540
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,921
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making a game based... They don't even talk.

1541
01:53:43,941 --> 01:53:46,941
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making a game based on my favorite show from 1995.

1542
01:53:47,021 --> 01:53:48,982
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fantastic.

1543
01:53:49,002 --> 01:53:49,422
[SPEAKER_06]: 2005, actually.

1544
01:53:49,722 --> 01:53:50,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so you know.

1545
01:53:50,702 --> 01:53:51,322
[SPEAKER_06]: It said 1995.

1546
01:53:52,662 --> 01:53:54,703
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's 2005, that one that I'm looking at there.

1547
01:53:54,903 --> 01:53:55,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 2005.

1548
01:53:55,083 --> 01:53:56,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

1549
01:53:56,243 --> 01:53:56,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1550
01:53:57,083 --> 01:53:57,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wrong.

1551
01:53:58,903 --> 01:54:02,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, the game was 95, wasn't it?

1552
01:54:05,449 --> 01:54:06,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, maybe?

1553
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:09,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was because I was in college in Alabama.

1554
01:54:10,552 --> 01:54:10,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1555
01:54:11,093 --> 01:54:12,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Kicking people's asses!

1556
01:54:13,394 --> 01:54:22,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's not that they make games based off of shows, like CSI has games, Survivor has games that aren't very good.

1557
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Wheel of Fortune, you just said, has a game coming out next week.

1558
01:54:26,302 --> 01:54:29,744
[SPEAKER_08]: So, surely Killer Instinct, a cancelled show from eight years ago.

1559
01:54:29,944 --> 01:54:31,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 2005, my mistake, not 1995.

1560
01:54:32,205 --> 01:54:41,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely a cancelled series from seven years ago might have a game at some point, so therefore... I know, considering that it ran a whole, what, 13 episodes?

1561
01:54:42,011 --> 01:54:48,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, people would totally... No, I'm sorry, not even 13 episodes, because four of those episodes were unaired.

1562
01:54:49,075 --> 01:54:54,118
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh... According to GameGuru, sounds like your typical cancelled Fox show.

1563
01:54:54,538 --> 01:54:54,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1564
01:54:54,818 --> 01:54:56,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So nine episodes.

1565
01:54:56,279 --> 01:54:58,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, people are going to totally confuse it for that piece of shit.

1566
01:54:59,741 --> 01:55:01,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure, you know.

1567
01:55:02,116 --> 01:55:08,838
[SPEAKER_08]: We would get a Wonderfalls video game before we would get a Killer Instinct video game based off the show.

1568
01:55:09,878 --> 01:55:11,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure this will be appealing.

1569
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:12,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, you know what this sounds like?

1570
01:55:12,799 --> 01:55:17,540
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds like a really crappy rip-off of Law & Order SVU.

1571
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:18,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably is.

1572
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:23,021
[SPEAKER_06]: They're part of the, get this, the Deviant Crimes Unit, the DCU.

1573
01:55:26,022 --> 01:55:27,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the DCU.

1574
01:55:28,784 --> 01:55:31,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally not a ripoff of the SVU.

1575
01:55:31,545 --> 01:55:36,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it just goes to show that intellectual property laws in this country are kind of borked.

1576
01:55:37,168 --> 01:55:43,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, technically, by the same logic, this show shouldn't have existed in the first place because of the game.

1577
01:55:44,994 --> 01:55:45,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1578
01:56:08,021 --> 01:56:09,502
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1579
01:56:27,697 --> 01:56:33,681
[SPEAKER_08]: An 8-bit fan game had a little preview this week, the Mega Man 25th anniversary.

1580
01:56:34,462 --> 01:56:43,628
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a Canadian-based group, Team Reaverbot, but it's kind of a Voltron of various people here.

1581
01:56:43,968 --> 01:56:51,414
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Julian Spillane from DHX Media or Silicon Knights, Jason Kanam from Drinkbox Studios,

1582
01:56:52,094 --> 01:57:00,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Ori Falconer and Daniel Ochoa from Vast Studios and Tim McLennan from Gameloft and then an independent artist, Jeff Canan.

1583
01:57:00,638 --> 01:57:08,141
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is, you know, again, it's kind of your basic NES throwback, but with like all new bosses and I can play a little preview here.

1584
01:57:09,421 --> 01:57:15,444
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's not all that different from Mega Man 9 and 10, because people seem to love their retro Mega Mans.

1585
01:57:15,964 --> 01:57:21,006
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, see, that guy actually shoots acid, which is in line with the theme stage here.

1586
01:57:21,746 --> 01:57:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: They even have all new bosses, right?

1587
01:57:23,607 --> 01:57:32,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there's actually Sledge Man, Bio Man, Taro Man, Kendo Man, Amp Man, Neon Man, Comet Man, and Totem Man.

1588
01:57:33,035 --> 01:57:33,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter X Mega Man

1589
01:57:55,632 --> 01:57:56,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, yes.

1590
01:57:56,212 --> 01:57:57,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's what it is.

1591
01:57:57,792 --> 01:57:59,933
[SPEAKER_08]: This was also something that was announced.

1592
01:58:00,013 --> 01:58:01,313
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a little more official.

1593
01:58:01,693 --> 01:58:04,154
[SPEAKER_08]: That other one was more of a like indie, whatever.

1594
01:58:04,254 --> 01:58:05,614
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a little more official.

1595
01:58:06,114 --> 01:58:06,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of, though.

1596
01:58:07,094 --> 01:58:12,676
[SPEAKER_08]: The interesting thing about this, this project, the Street Fighter X Mega Man, has been going on for a while.

1597
01:58:12,776 --> 01:58:17,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can find the guy's YouTube channel and find these old concept videos from like three years ago.

1598
01:58:17,497 --> 01:58:19,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So this has been being worked on for quite some time.

1599
01:58:19,938 --> 01:58:36,500
[SPEAKER_08]: at some point Capcom caught wind of it because now Capcom is going to be the ones that are sending it out through their Unity blog the Capcom Unity blog and they're going to make it a free download on December 17th, 2012 you know for all the shit

1600
01:58:37,461 --> 01:58:40,743
[SPEAKER_08]: that Capcom gets for pissing off their fanbase over the past year.

1601
01:58:41,184 --> 01:58:46,647
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very interesting kind of band-aid to try and make it right with the community.

1602
01:58:47,168 --> 01:58:54,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, they see this indie project's going on and for all practical purposes they have every right to shut the damn thing down.

1603
01:58:55,069 --> 01:59:00,815
[SPEAKER_08]: But they've learned from watching what happens to other stuff when that goes on that this is going to get out there to the internet anyway.

1604
01:59:01,256 --> 01:59:08,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's embrace it, give the guy a little guidance, and then give it out as a goodwill thing for free and end up giving the guy some exposure.

1605
01:59:09,064 --> 01:59:09,965
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks kind of neat.

1606
01:59:10,826 --> 01:59:15,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of does the whole parody of Mega Man 2 here in the intro, but...

1607
01:59:16,393 --> 01:59:27,529
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see, like, Ryu's stage, and it even does these interesting things where, like, the bosses have, because they're Street Fighter characters, have, like, super meters.

1608
01:59:27,549 --> 01:59:28,109
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

1609
01:59:29,881 --> 01:59:36,166
[SPEAKER_08]: The bosses have, like, super meters, and once they fill up, it'll do, like, this little zoom in, and they do their super attack.

1610
01:59:36,186 --> 01:59:36,907
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of funny.

1611
01:59:37,567 --> 01:59:43,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching some of the old concept videos online, so... It's really neat that it came to life.

1612
01:59:44,673 --> 01:59:49,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wonder if the guy got any help officially from Capcom, or what.

1613
01:59:50,778 --> 01:59:51,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1614
01:59:52,479 --> 01:59:53,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can get it free on December 17th.

1615
01:59:56,753 --> 02:00:00,795
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, the super fan behind this, Sonic is the name he uses online.

1616
02:00:01,395 --> 02:00:03,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Xiao Zong Hui.

1617
02:00:03,556 --> 02:00:06,097
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a pro-competitive gamer, additionally.

1618
02:00:06,978 --> 02:00:07,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

1619
02:00:07,638 --> 02:00:08,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, I love this music.

1620
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:14,361
[SPEAKER_11]: The old end-of-game music.

1621
02:00:14,941 --> 02:00:17,562
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Brental Floss did lyrics to it.

1622
02:00:18,363 --> 02:00:18,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

1623
02:00:20,564 --> 02:00:24,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I love looking at the little chibi Street Fighter characters done up in Mega Man style.

1624
02:00:24,846 --> 02:00:25,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's awesome.

1625
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:47,619
[SPEAKER_08]: so alright going back to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com GameGuru commented on that last story about Killer Instinct saying that the TV show came out right as Nintendo let that Killer Instinct trademark expire so a small correction to me getting angry there a minute ago good to know

1626
02:00:49,188 --> 02:00:57,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Tetsuya in chat talking on this Capcom Mega Man thing says, yeah, the way Capcom handled that made me even more interested in checking it out.

1627
02:00:57,196 --> 02:00:59,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always down for more retro Mega Man.

1628
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:04,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Panaxium in chat says, I'd play it if my reflexes weren't shit.

1629
02:01:05,364 --> 02:01:06,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting old.

1630
02:01:07,306 --> 02:01:08,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you and me both.

1631
02:01:09,946 --> 02:01:11,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully there's an easy mode.

1632
02:01:12,649 --> 02:01:14,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Mega Man 2 style easy mode.

1633
02:01:15,112 --> 02:01:16,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, more news.

1634
02:01:16,333 --> 02:01:17,154
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

1635
02:01:18,256 --> 02:01:18,496
[SPEAKER_08]: News?

[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

[SPEAKER_08]: We're to the mailbag.

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the news is you all emailed us and now we're going to give you answers.

1640
02:01:24,283 --> 02:01:24,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking hell.

02:01:25,564 --> 02:01:34,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna dive in the mailbag headfirst and pick out a few emails.

1642
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:40,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were actually kind of, like, some weeks we get no emails whatsoever.

1643
02:01:40,436 --> 02:01:41,677
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, we got a bunch.

1644
02:01:41,858 --> 02:01:42,818
[SPEAKER_11]: All the emails!

1645
02:01:42,979 --> 02:01:43,659
[SPEAKER_08]: All the emails.

1646
02:01:43,719 --> 02:01:47,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So DarkSakura, I think, can only read some tonight, but she's gonna pick some and read them.

1647
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:47,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go through them.

1648
02:01:48,383 --> 02:01:48,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodie.

1649
02:01:49,044 --> 02:01:51,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Searcher here, what are the good games?

1650
02:01:51,766 --> 02:01:53,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, what are the good games?

1651
02:01:54,648 --> 02:01:55,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the whole sentence?

1652
02:01:55,749 --> 02:01:55,929
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1653
02:01:56,209 --> 02:01:56,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

1654
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:57,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I like JRPGs.

1655
02:01:57,851 --> 02:02:02,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, and Animal Crossing Wild World, which I guess that isn't really a JRPG.

1656
02:02:02,795 --> 02:02:04,596
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more of a kind of a sim, I guess.

1657
02:02:05,357 --> 02:02:06,438
[SPEAKER_11]: What are other good games?

1658
02:02:06,738 --> 02:02:08,199
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think if the world ends with you?

1659
02:02:08,539 --> 02:02:09,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Love the show.

1660
02:02:10,702 --> 02:02:19,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna guess he left out a sentence for the DS Because all those games he named are DS games, right?

1661
02:02:19,868 --> 02:02:22,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess So what are good DS games?

1662
02:02:22,529 --> 02:02:34,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan likes Fire Emblem I mean, that's more of a strategy RPG You know what game is surprisingly good is the Card House one The Clubhouse games, that's what it is Clubhouse games was really good

1663
02:02:35,117 --> 02:02:37,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's looking specifically for JRPGs.

1664
02:02:38,218 --> 02:02:40,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you could play Final Fantasy 3, Final Fantasy 4.

1665
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:45,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the Final Fantasy 4, 3 and 4 remakes are really good on DS.

1666
02:02:45,582 --> 02:02:51,204
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, side story, did you hear about Final Fantasy 4 is getting its iOS release like Final Fantasy 3 did?

1667
02:02:51,584 --> 02:02:51,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

1668
02:02:51,984 --> 02:02:56,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy 4 is going to be coming out for what, Android and iPad and iPhone and all that stuff?

1669
02:02:57,067 --> 02:02:57,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Android.

1670
02:02:58,227 --> 02:02:58,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying.

1671
02:02:59,448 --> 02:03:02,509
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out for all those systems before the end of the year, I think.

1672
02:03:02,609 --> 02:03:03,269
[SPEAKER_08]: At least in Japan.

1673
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:04,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1674
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:05,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

1675
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:07,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Howdy, OLR.

1676
02:03:07,372 --> 02:03:08,893
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your favorite catastrophic moggy.

1677
02:03:09,273 --> 02:03:11,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, this week I come bearing sad news.

1678
02:03:11,295 --> 02:03:16,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike every other time I've emailed recently where I bitch about release dates for certain games, or lack thereof.

1679
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:23,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the name will mean little to you, but earlier today, Sir Patrick Moore passed away at the age of 89.

1680
02:03:23,924 --> 02:03:28,588
[SPEAKER_11]: He was best known as an astronomer and the host of the long-winning BBC TV show, The Sky at Night.

1681
02:03:29,989 --> 02:03:30,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Total goodbyes.

1682
02:03:58,033 --> 02:04:02,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I never saw it, so I don't have that emotional attachment, but I can imagine.

1683
02:04:02,116 --> 02:04:04,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew who he was as an astronomer.

1684
02:04:04,737 --> 02:04:07,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine the day when Mark Summers passes away.

1685
02:04:07,359 --> 02:04:08,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We are all going to have a cry.

1686
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,161
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all going to throw green slime at you.

1687
02:04:12,242 --> 02:04:13,402
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's funny about Mark Summers?

1688
02:04:13,543 --> 02:04:13,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

1689
02:04:14,343 --> 02:04:16,985
[SPEAKER_11]: He was pathologically... Yeah, OCD.

1690
02:04:18,024 --> 02:04:21,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as far as things, he hated dirty anything.

1691
02:04:22,808 --> 02:04:23,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it was a job.

1692
02:04:24,449 --> 02:04:28,953
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, going back to the DS email, Meteos is like my favorite DS game.

1693
02:04:28,973 --> 02:04:30,234
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a puzzler and it's great.

1694
02:04:30,634 --> 02:04:31,735
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I have my Puyo Puyo.

1695
02:04:32,115 --> 02:04:34,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a JRPG, sorry, but Meteos is great.

1696
02:04:34,958 --> 02:04:36,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying it's a great game.

1697
02:04:36,519 --> 02:04:39,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Since he left out a sentence in that email, I'm just going to make up what it said.

1698
02:04:40,622 --> 02:04:41,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Way to assume, Rob.

1699
02:04:41,923 --> 02:04:42,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's what I do.

1700
02:04:43,206 --> 02:04:49,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, hello OLR crew, this is Ramaditya from Indonesia.

1701
02:04:49,551 --> 02:04:50,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's actually right.

1702
02:04:50,572 --> 02:04:53,475
[SPEAKER_11]: This email is probably rather personal because we are fellow gamers.

1703
02:04:53,855 --> 02:04:55,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's alright for me to ask your blessings.

1704
02:04:55,897 --> 02:04:56,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just got married.

1705
02:04:57,358 --> 02:04:57,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Congrats.

1706
02:04:58,819 --> 02:05:00,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I write this email soon after the party is over.

1707
02:05:00,841 --> 02:05:01,701
[SPEAKER_11]: It's December the 9th.

1708
02:05:03,563 --> 02:05:04,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute.

1709
02:05:04,804 --> 02:05:09,808
[SPEAKER_08]: When the marriage and the celebration and the party is over, don't email your favorite podcast.

1710
02:05:10,409 --> 02:05:11,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Get to the baby making.

1711
02:05:13,126 --> 02:05:13,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Consumate.

1712
02:05:16,967 --> 02:05:17,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Consumate.

1713
02:05:17,587 --> 02:05:19,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to assume he meant after all of that.

1714
02:05:19,328 --> 02:05:19,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1715
02:05:20,588 --> 02:05:24,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that marriage is such a common thing, but for me it is special.

1716
02:05:24,749 --> 02:05:27,230
[SPEAKER_11]: What I mean is how it will make my gaming life special.

1717
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:30,371
[SPEAKER_11]: As a blind person like me, it is very difficult to enjoy video games.

1718
02:05:30,811 --> 02:05:33,612
[SPEAKER_11]: An 8-bit, 16-bit era were the only great memories I could remember.

1719
02:05:34,172 --> 02:05:36,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It is fortunate that my wife is also a gamer.

1720
02:05:36,773 --> 02:05:37,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1721
02:05:56,636 --> 02:05:58,557
[SPEAKER_11]: The way I will play the game is like this.

1722
02:05:58,697 --> 02:06:02,380
[SPEAKER_11]: She will explain to me what to do and I will play it with my game in the controller.

1723
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:04,401
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, go left, don't go right, etc.

1724
02:06:05,462 --> 02:06:07,863
[SPEAKER_11]: That way, for instance, I can still play Galaxian and so on.

1725
02:06:08,264 --> 02:06:11,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Our best collaboration was when we finished Contra with 30 lives code.

1726
02:06:12,066 --> 02:06:12,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's all for now.

1727
02:06:12,927 --> 02:06:17,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope this little story can inspire other people, even with disabilities, that they can still enjoy video games.

1728
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:19,751
[SPEAKER_11]: P.S.

1729
02:06:20,251 --> 02:06:22,253
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll send you real-time video of how I play games.

1730
02:06:22,713 --> 02:06:23,173
[SPEAKER_11]: P.P.S.

1731
02:06:23,453 --> 02:06:24,834
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a little pic for my marriage party.

1732
02:06:25,114 --> 02:06:25,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm going to look at it.

1733
02:06:26,621 --> 02:06:27,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to look at it.

1734
02:06:27,262 --> 02:06:28,423
[SPEAKER_08]: It was blocked on Facebook.

1735
02:06:28,484 --> 02:06:29,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1736
02:06:30,727 --> 02:06:31,908
[SPEAKER_11]: We would love to enjoy your photo.

1737
02:06:32,048 --> 02:06:33,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that story is so cute, though.

1738
02:06:33,931 --> 02:06:34,211
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

1739
02:06:34,351 --> 02:06:36,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just... That's great.

1740
02:06:37,115 --> 02:06:37,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that story.

1741
02:06:38,176 --> 02:06:38,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

1742
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:40,840
[SPEAKER_08]: You and Dan...

1743
02:06:41,921 --> 02:06:45,224
[SPEAKER_08]: You told me you guys kind of do something similar too in your relationship.

1744
02:06:45,584 --> 02:06:49,407
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not facing a disability on the severity of blindness.

1745
02:06:49,687 --> 02:06:51,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I face motion sickness.

1746
02:06:51,809 --> 02:06:53,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, that's a thing.

1747
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:56,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And your ergonomic thing with your hand.

1748
02:06:56,192 --> 02:06:57,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this was before my hand.

1749
02:06:57,533 --> 02:06:57,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1750
02:06:58,153 --> 02:07:01,696
[SPEAKER_11]: But we would play Resident Evil 2 and I'd walk them through the game with the strategy guide.

1751
02:07:01,956 --> 02:07:04,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because I couldn't watch the screen all the time.

1752
02:07:04,078 --> 02:07:05,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd get a little motion sick.

1753
02:07:05,378 --> 02:07:07,660
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's something we would do together.

1754
02:07:09,161 --> 02:07:10,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so moving forward.

1755
02:07:10,342 --> 02:07:12,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan and I leveled characters in Warcraft together.

1756
02:07:12,383 --> 02:07:12,944
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we did.

1757
02:07:13,544 --> 02:07:15,165
[SPEAKER_08]: We did his first character.

1758
02:07:15,185 --> 02:07:16,145
[SPEAKER_10]: What about our paladins?

1759
02:07:17,506 --> 02:07:18,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Our paladin pals?

1760
02:07:19,047 --> 02:07:20,468
[SPEAKER_08]: You and I aren't in a relationship.

1761
02:07:20,508 --> 02:07:21,388
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

1762
02:07:22,029 --> 02:07:23,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Our paladin pals were fun.

1763
02:07:23,229 --> 02:07:24,370
[SPEAKER_08]: They can be friends.

1764
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:27,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane and I have leveled at least three characters together.

1765
02:07:27,312 --> 02:07:28,893
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fun friend thing to do, too.

1766
02:07:28,953 --> 02:07:30,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I need someone to finish leveling.

1767
02:07:30,534 --> 02:07:32,395
[SPEAKER_11]: We just set a time and we'll do it.

1768
02:07:32,515 --> 02:07:34,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Help me level my stupid troll character.

1769
02:07:35,898 --> 02:07:37,159
[SPEAKER_08]: God, anyway.

1770
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:39,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, Loki, do you and Nellie do any bonding thing?

1771
02:07:39,782 --> 02:07:40,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, please.

1772
02:07:42,065 --> 02:07:42,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

1773
02:07:42,665 --> 02:07:44,207
[SPEAKER_08]: You play the game and she mocks you.

1774
02:07:44,227 --> 02:07:48,251
[SPEAKER_06]: What was she asking the other night?

1775
02:07:48,271 --> 02:07:51,395
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I don't know, like, what are you doing?

1776
02:07:51,755 --> 02:07:53,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm hunting dingoes.

1777
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:56,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they eat your baby?

1778
02:07:56,934 --> 02:07:57,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care.

1779
02:07:57,595 --> 02:07:57,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1780
02:08:12,265 --> 02:08:14,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey gang, I just thought I would drop a line and say hey.

1781
02:08:14,647 --> 02:08:14,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

1782
02:08:15,768 --> 02:08:19,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Watched the VGAs last night and I must say I was very impressed with the Game of the Year winner.

1783
02:08:20,332 --> 02:08:22,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I just finished The Walking Dead about two weeks ago.

1784
02:08:22,734 --> 02:08:28,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I found myself finishing an episode or sitting in my office and pondering whether the decisions I made were the right ones.

1785
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,961
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's when you know you've played a great game.

1786
02:08:31,522 --> 02:08:37,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So good work, Telltale, for beating the Call of Duty's Borderlands and all the other big name AAA games.

1787
02:08:38,127 --> 02:08:38,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Goes to show what you...

1788
02:08:40,089 --> 02:08:41,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have played Sleeping Dogs.

1789
02:08:59,335 --> 02:09:03,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I just started playing after picking it up on the Steam Thanksgiving sale and I'm pretty blown away.

1790
02:09:03,658 --> 02:09:08,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't have a very high expectation when I started it, yet I am having a blast playing it.

1791
02:09:08,942 --> 02:09:11,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So check it out if you haven't and if you have, what did you think?

1792
02:09:12,444 --> 02:09:15,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was pretty fun, although I got bored of it pretty quick.

1793
02:09:16,807 --> 02:09:22,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Now everyone stop what you're doing and it should be Y-O-U apostrophe R-E, not Y-O-U-R.

1794
02:09:22,552 --> 02:09:24,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I will correct everyone who does this.

1795
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:26,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Grammar Lessons with DarkSakura

1796
02:09:39,094 --> 02:09:42,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you haven't yet, go play The Walking Dead.

1797
02:09:42,959 --> 02:09:43,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, one more thing.

1798
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:46,743
[SPEAKER_11]: After I complete Dogs That Aren't Awake, I'm going to pick up Far Cry 3.

1799
02:09:47,504 --> 02:09:48,825
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't a fan of 2, though.

1800
02:09:48,925 --> 02:09:50,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I have it on PS3 and Steam.

1801
02:09:50,707 --> 02:09:54,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Just didn't find it appealing, so if any of you have played 2 or 3, your thoughts, por favor.

1802
02:09:54,612 --> 02:09:55,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the good work, Travis.

1803
02:09:56,792 --> 02:09:59,013
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Loki question as far as Far Cry goes.

1804
02:09:59,153 --> 02:10:00,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't play Far Cry.

1805
02:10:00,233 --> 02:10:03,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Walking Dead, I'm making it a point I will play that before the end of the year.

1806
02:10:03,874 --> 02:10:08,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to name a game of the year until I've at least played that because that's what everybody really seems to be into.

1807
02:10:08,675 --> 02:10:10,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm making it a point to play more Mass Effect 3.

1808
02:10:12,076 --> 02:10:13,276
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty dull point.

1809
02:10:13,816 --> 02:10:14,456
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1810
02:10:15,197 --> 02:10:15,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go ahead.

1811
02:10:15,837 --> 02:10:16,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a butt bite it.

1812
02:10:17,546 --> 02:10:17,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Loki.

1813
02:10:19,527 --> 02:10:20,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Far Cry 3 is awesome.

1814
02:10:20,668 --> 02:10:22,388
[SPEAKER_06]: What about 2?

1815
02:10:22,809 --> 02:10:28,011
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, I didn't play because the same reason why I didn't like Dead Rising.

1816
02:10:28,411 --> 02:10:29,992
[SPEAKER_06]: You have malaria in the game.

1817
02:10:30,412 --> 02:10:33,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to constantly give yourself medication bullshit like that.

1818
02:10:34,454 --> 02:10:35,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that.

1819
02:10:35,494 --> 02:10:38,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Rising 2 sucked because of that crap.

1820
02:10:38,396 --> 02:10:40,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got Dead Rising 2 off the record.

1821
02:10:40,057 --> 02:10:41,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, sweet.

1822
02:10:41,457 --> 02:10:44,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to worry about the stupid having to get medicine for a stupid girl.

1823
02:10:45,459 --> 02:10:51,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but then, guess what, Frank West, he has the problem, and he needs to get the fucking Zombrex for himself.

1824
02:10:51,164 --> 02:10:57,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, gone, get rid of this game, because it's absolute shit.

1825
02:10:58,309 --> 02:11:01,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, I do not enjoy games that you have malaria in.

1826
02:11:02,332 --> 02:11:04,774
[SPEAKER_06]: But Far Cry 3 is awesome, because you do not have malaria in that.

1827
02:11:06,696 --> 02:11:08,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Malaria-free games are awesome.

1828
02:11:09,658 --> 02:11:09,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1829
02:11:09,998 --> 02:11:10,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1830
02:11:11,263 --> 02:11:13,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I should call in sick to work with malaria.

1831
02:11:14,205 --> 02:11:17,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry Mosquito bit me even though they're, you know, in larval stage right now.

1832
02:11:19,169 --> 02:11:22,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, I'm a new listener and I've got to say that you guys have one awesome show.

1833
02:11:22,732 --> 02:11:23,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1834
02:11:23,432 --> 02:11:23,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks.

1835
02:11:24,233 --> 02:11:28,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only been listening for a few weeks and I already feel like you guys are close friends that I've known forever.

1836
02:11:29,137 --> 02:11:29,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

1837
02:11:30,318 --> 02:11:32,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had very similar problems and in my life I...

1838
02:11:34,471 --> 02:11:35,452
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been having headaches.

1839
02:11:35,532 --> 02:11:37,233
[SPEAKER_11]: My cat, Stripes, just passed away.

1840
02:11:37,293 --> 02:11:37,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1841
02:11:38,894 --> 02:11:43,277
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've always, and he always laid in my lap while I played Minecraft and Xbox.

1842
02:11:43,357 --> 02:11:47,960
[SPEAKER_11]: But the point is that you have a great way to make the show feel like a great chat with friends and keep up the good work.

1843
02:11:49,061 --> 02:11:49,801
[SPEAKER_11]: That was our goal.

1844
02:11:50,422 --> 02:11:51,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Mission accomplished!

1845
02:11:51,522 --> 02:11:52,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

1846
02:11:52,363 --> 02:11:53,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Mission accomplished.

1847
02:11:53,143 --> 02:11:55,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for validating exactly what we sent out to do.

1848
02:11:55,925 --> 02:12:04,191
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted this podcast to be exactly what dinner after playing DDR at the arcade for a night was, which was just sitting around,

1849
02:12:04,732 --> 02:12:08,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Talkin' some smack, havin' a good time, bein' bros, right, Jamie?

1850
02:12:09,179 --> 02:12:10,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, brofist.

1851
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:10,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Brofist.

1852
02:12:11,182 --> 02:12:11,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Do bros.

1853
02:12:13,346 --> 02:12:17,512
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, every time you say that, though, I think of John's WoW character, Bro Dude.

1854
02:12:17,673 --> 02:12:18,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Bro Dude.

1855
02:12:19,746 --> 02:12:23,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost made girl chick, just to be funny.

1856
02:12:23,049 --> 02:12:23,469
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have.

1857
02:12:23,729 --> 02:12:25,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have, but no one's ever on that server.

1858
02:12:26,071 --> 02:12:28,673
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyhow, thank you for validating what we're trying to do.

1859
02:12:28,933 --> 02:12:29,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1860
02:12:29,114 --> 02:12:29,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

1861
02:12:30,695 --> 02:12:31,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Greetings, OLR.

1862
02:12:31,655 --> 02:12:32,876
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1863
02:12:33,597 --> 02:12:40,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer.

1864
02:12:40,362 --> 02:12:41,903
[SPEAKER_08]: His fried bologna hole?

1865
02:12:42,124 --> 02:12:43,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what he called it?

1866
02:12:43,345 --> 02:12:43,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1867
02:12:43,665 --> 02:12:43,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1868
02:12:46,766 --> 02:12:47,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Equating it to WoW.

1869
02:12:48,067 --> 02:12:51,589
[SPEAKER_11]: You completely missed the fact that WoW is always updating and adding new things to the game.

1870
02:12:52,089 --> 02:13:00,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that anything resembling logic runs through his brain before he opens his fried bologna hole without comparing COD to other games?

1871
02:13:00,814 --> 02:13:04,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think they have a right or should charge for online play?

1872
02:13:04,636 --> 02:13:07,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun fact, I don't play either COD or WoW as I hate them both.

1873
02:13:08,018 --> 02:13:09,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, um, um, um.

1874
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:12,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Games do charge for online play.

1875
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you missed the online pass train?

1876
02:13:16,841 --> 02:13:18,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you forget about that?

1877
02:13:19,221 --> 02:13:20,042
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the thing.

1878
02:13:20,062 --> 02:13:20,722
[SPEAKER_08]: What was he talking about?

1879
02:13:20,742 --> 02:13:22,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Games charging for online play?

1880
02:13:22,742 --> 02:13:24,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Read the first part of the email again.

1881
02:13:25,003 --> 02:13:31,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Patcher opened his fried bologna hole again, saying that Activision should charge for playing multiplayer, equating it to WoW.

1882
02:13:32,659 --> 02:13:35,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I agree with that in one state.

1883
02:13:35,261 --> 02:13:36,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Only one reason.

1884
02:13:36,062 --> 02:13:40,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if they went throughout where... Because a lot of people just buy it for the multiplayer.

1885
02:13:41,327 --> 02:13:48,753
[SPEAKER_06]: In which case, if they sold it like Killzone, where they have the multiplayer version that you can buy for $15.

1886
02:13:50,535 --> 02:13:51,235
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1887
02:14:11,175 --> 02:14:11,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1888
02:14:32,001 --> 02:14:34,003
[SPEAKER_06]: 8 million copies sold is just ridiculous.

1889
02:14:34,023 --> 02:14:38,828
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't charge to play online when you're already charging to play online on the Xbox.

1890
02:14:38,868 --> 02:14:40,229
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Xbox Gold is.

1891
02:14:40,389 --> 02:14:46,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, the minute I get double dipped for this shit, my Xbox is going for sale on eBay.

1892
02:14:46,475 --> 02:14:47,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll even autograph it.

1893
02:14:48,156 --> 02:14:48,837
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.

1894
02:14:49,057 --> 02:14:49,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't

1895
02:14:50,018 --> 02:14:51,159
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1896
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:23,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see what you did there.

1897
02:15:23,237 --> 02:15:23,997
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

1898
02:15:24,778 --> 02:15:25,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

1899
02:15:26,158 --> 02:15:26,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there more email?

1900
02:15:26,979 --> 02:15:27,179
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1901
02:15:27,779 --> 02:15:29,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there is, but there was more to that one.

1902
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:30,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1903
02:15:30,501 --> 02:15:31,701
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, Good day, citizens.

1904
02:15:31,862 --> 02:15:32,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Serious turtle.

1905
02:15:33,547 --> 02:15:33,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1906
02:15:34,868 --> 02:15:37,348
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the last email that matters.

1907
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

1908
02:15:39,689 --> 02:15:51,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure achievements and trophies aren't such a big thing for you guys, but do you sort of wish Steam's achievements added up to an overall gamerscore as with Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network, or even iOS slash Mac Game Center?

1909
02:15:51,633 --> 02:15:57,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And that comes from Robert M. It'd be okay, but it's not a deal breaker.

1910
02:15:57,155 --> 02:15:57,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really care.

1911
02:15:58,636 --> 02:16:01,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, are we talking like a unified achievement system?

1912
02:16:02,335 --> 02:16:07,359
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what the website Raptor tries to do a little bit.

1913
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:09,801
[SPEAKER_08]: R-A-P-T-R, I think it's spelled.

1914
02:16:10,362 --> 02:16:12,544
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what they're trying to do with their site.

1915
02:16:12,624 --> 02:16:17,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but they try to track all your gaming accomplishments.

1916
02:16:17,028 --> 02:16:25,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't track my game progress in Grand Theft Auto 4, although I know it's retroactive, but I played the fuck out of Grand Theft Auto 4 and it says I haven't played it at all.

1917
02:16:25,515 --> 02:16:26,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that on 360?

1918
02:16:26,836 --> 02:16:27,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1919
02:16:27,277 --> 02:16:30,500
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird because it picks up all my Mass Effect activity and all that stuff.

1920
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:33,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but stuff that you'd play before you joined Raptor or during?

1921
02:16:34,124 --> 02:16:35,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it picked up the before.

1922
02:16:35,425 --> 02:16:36,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the hours.

1923
02:16:36,146 --> 02:16:37,627
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't pick up the hours from before.

1924
02:16:37,687 --> 02:16:40,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have because I played the fuck out of that.

1925
02:16:40,770 --> 02:16:42,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you what, I hate the crap out of Origin.

1926
02:16:43,911 --> 02:17:05,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too which is why I always at least run my Mass Effect 3 through Steam so that it'll pop up through Steam and then Origin I'm not sure there's a way to really unify all that though unfortunately like sorry to the emailer but I think some people are trying to create online I've heard of a gaming social network and I can't remember the name that I think is aspiring to do something very similar as well

1927
02:17:05,558 --> 02:17:14,805
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have these different startups that are kind of competing to fill that void of your universal gaming badge, but nobody's really cracked into the mainstream yet.

1928
02:17:14,865 --> 02:17:18,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Raptor's probably the biggest one I can think of, but they're not a Twitter.

1929
02:17:18,467 --> 02:17:19,628
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not a Facebook yet.

1930
02:17:19,668 --> 02:17:24,371
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still very, very niche, and I bet a lot of gamers still haven't heard of them.

1931
02:17:25,232 --> 02:17:34,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun in chat says, Raptor's pretty nice, but there's plenty of stuff it doesn't track, like Minecraft with third-party launchers, and it tries to make you use their shitty web browser, but the stats are nice.

1932
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:38,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you have it.

1933
02:17:38,685 --> 02:17:39,126
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1934
02:17:39,206 --> 02:17:43,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you wish to send us emails in the future.

1935
02:17:46,238 --> 02:17:47,681
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the part of the show where we get angsty.

1936
02:18:06,166 --> 02:18:14,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually can't really say anything about it, so it's a blanket F you to a situation that I really can't do much about right now.

1937
02:18:15,648 --> 02:18:15,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

1938
02:18:16,668 --> 02:18:18,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you're being so expensive.

1939
02:18:19,009 --> 02:18:29,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually looking, I was just real quickly going through Newegg to see if I could create one of those Alienware PCs that they have for cheaper than obviously they offer them, and yeah, you probably can.

1940
02:18:30,424 --> 02:18:33,528
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still expensive.

1941
02:18:33,808 --> 02:18:34,850
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to latkes.

1942
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:36,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how fat you've made me tonight?

1943
02:18:37,493 --> 02:18:37,753
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1944
02:18:37,994 --> 02:18:41,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how many hours on the treadmill I won't spend burning this off?

1945
02:18:41,518 --> 02:18:41,778
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1946
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, potassium.

1947
02:18:45,663 --> 02:18:46,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I eat bananas.

1948
02:18:47,025 --> 02:18:48,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, potatoes have more potassium.

1949
02:18:54,167 --> 02:18:55,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Unify me a study.

1950
02:18:55,268 --> 02:18:56,129
[SPEAKER_08]: A scientific study.

1951
02:18:57,591 --> 02:19:05,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's do a couple more news stories and then we'll go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1952
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:08,003
[SPEAKER_08]: But not just yet, we do have a couple more stories for you guys.

1953
02:19:08,944 --> 02:19:09,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1954
02:19:09,605 --> 02:19:18,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because you know, Hitman has had its share of really bad marketing ideas, and well, there's yet another one.

1955
02:19:18,108 --> 02:19:24,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently they had a Facebook promotion where you can do a higher Hitman app.

1956
02:19:24,910 --> 02:19:34,057
[SPEAKER_06]: For Facebook, what it basically did was it allowed you to create these hits on different people.

1957
02:19:34,237 --> 02:19:40,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, some of the reasons, I guess, Target identified by, and then there's a drop-down box, reason for target elimination.

1958
02:19:41,482 --> 02:19:51,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the target identified by things are her small tits, or her muffin top, or her hairy legs, or her ginger hair, and that kind of stuff.

1959
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:52,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Some ridiculous things.

1960
02:19:54,893 --> 02:19:56,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently people took offense to that.

1961
02:19:56,874 --> 02:19:57,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you think?

1962
02:19:57,935 --> 02:19:58,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1963
02:19:58,816 --> 02:20:01,098
[SPEAKER_08]: And then... Imagine that, Loki.

1964
02:20:01,839 --> 02:20:05,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't possibly imagine how this could have possibly been offensive.

1965
02:20:06,022 --> 02:20:09,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Putting a hit out on your friend because they have hairy legs and small tits.

1966
02:20:10,526 --> 02:20:12,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't... I mean...

1967
02:20:14,637 --> 02:20:15,698
[SPEAKER_08]: The Madness of it all.

1968
02:20:41,872 --> 02:20:45,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess when they are killed, it tells the reason why.

1969
02:20:45,653 --> 02:20:52,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because Bob thought that your tits were small and that you were cheating on your partner or some garbage like that.

1970
02:20:54,075 --> 02:21:02,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess... Yeah, I guess people were kind of offended by that.

1971
02:21:02,697 --> 02:21:05,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we're sorry for any offense caused by this.

1972
02:21:05,498 --> 02:21:05,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

1973
02:21:06,823 --> 02:21:07,424
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

1974
02:21:31,485 --> 02:21:43,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine you woke up this week and imagine you go on Facebook and you check Facebook and you see a little thing that says Rob Roberts has put out a hit on you because you're a bitch and you smell.

1975
02:21:44,696 --> 02:21:46,197
[SPEAKER_08]: How would you have responded to that?

1976
02:21:46,598 --> 02:21:47,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to cut that hooker.

1977
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:50,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I cut that bitch.

1978
02:21:50,982 --> 02:21:53,564
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura apparently approved the app, ladies and gentlemen.

1979
02:21:53,604 --> 02:21:54,384
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't.

1980
02:21:54,484 --> 02:21:54,985
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't.

1981
02:21:57,006 --> 02:22:25,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I would cut a bitch though you would have written a 10 page paragraph about what bullshit that was as your status update I wouldn't I just ask people to explain certain social conventions that I find baffling SSJ100Matt says the fact that Square Enix dropped this so quickly tells me it was mostly behind their ad agency yeah I would think so

1982
02:22:27,379 --> 02:22:35,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I'm guessing the team involved had zero women on it, or the few women they had were shut out or ignored.

1983
02:22:35,626 --> 02:22:37,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, to be fair... You mean like DC Comics?

1984
02:22:38,809 --> 02:22:43,572
[SPEAKER_08]: He's probably right, but just because I have to ask this, because I want to know the full story.

1985
02:22:44,033 --> 02:22:48,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Could I put a hit out on a man for having small tits and hairy legs?

1986
02:22:49,037 --> 02:22:49,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you could.

1987
02:22:50,418 --> 02:22:53,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they would have those options, maybe.

1988
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:54,121
[SPEAKER_06]: They might, you know...

1989
02:22:54,341 --> 02:22:55,742
[SPEAKER_08]: You do have rather small boobs, Rob.

1990
02:22:55,782 --> 02:23:00,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they would sort them out because of, you know, by gender.

1991
02:23:00,465 --> 02:23:01,426
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have different things.

1992
02:23:02,127 --> 02:23:04,448
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, maybe small penis.

1993
02:23:05,069 --> 02:23:05,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, right, right.

1994
02:23:05,849 --> 02:23:06,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, I don't know.

1995
02:23:08,091 --> 02:23:09,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Still not smart.

1996
02:23:10,913 --> 02:23:11,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't mishear me.

1997
02:23:11,734 --> 02:23:14,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of his large penis.

1998
02:23:14,876 --> 02:23:17,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I put out a hit on him because his penis is too large.

1999
02:23:17,798 --> 02:23:18,739
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

2000
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:21,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know her?

2001
02:23:21,461 --> 02:23:22,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Her dick is so little.

2002
02:23:23,042 --> 02:23:23,122
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2003
02:23:25,166 --> 02:23:28,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't think it's even that necessarily it had zero women on it.

2004
02:23:28,371 --> 02:23:30,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It had zero people that like...

2005
02:23:32,475 --> 02:23:35,697
[SPEAKER_08]: are in the demographic they're trying to target.

2006
02:23:36,337 --> 02:23:40,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the biggest problem with things like this.

2007
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:48,304
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just imagine all these old fuddy-duddies sitting in a room talking about what's cool and what's hip and what the youngsters are into.

2008
02:23:48,324 --> 02:23:50,725
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hip, I'm cool.

2009
02:23:50,885 --> 02:23:52,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

2010
02:23:53,146 --> 02:23:59,630
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had shown this to anybody, you would have been told, it's stupid.

2011
02:24:02,159 --> 02:24:04,200
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dumb.

2012
02:24:05,501 --> 02:24:05,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2013
02:24:06,562 --> 02:24:07,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

2014
02:24:07,602 --> 02:24:11,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, good on them shutting it down as fast as they did, but lesson learned.

2015
02:24:12,385 --> 02:24:14,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Screen that shit before it goes live.

2016
02:24:15,747 --> 02:24:19,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

2017
02:24:19,269 --> 02:24:20,130
[SPEAKER_08]: This is interesting.

2018
02:24:21,638 --> 02:24:25,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever heard of a VRC6 cartridge back in the days, NES?

2019
02:24:26,721 --> 02:24:29,323
[SPEAKER_08]: VRC, Memory Management Controller Chip.

2020
02:24:29,363 --> 02:24:33,005
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something that Konami had on Famicom cartridges.

2021
02:24:33,065 --> 02:24:37,828
[SPEAKER_08]: It would add three extra sound channels, allowing for richer audio.

2022
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:38,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's an example.

2023
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:44,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what Castlevania III sounds like in the U.S., in the NES.

2024
02:24:48,965 --> 02:24:53,009
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's what it sounded like on the Famicom because of the three extra sound channels.

2025
02:24:53,169 --> 02:24:54,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this version too.

2026
02:25:01,656 --> 02:25:02,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Very different, huh?

2027
02:25:02,497 --> 02:25:03,838
[SPEAKER_08]: You should hear how The Legend of Zelda sounds.

2028
02:25:03,858 --> 02:25:08,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know how many fucking games were dumbed down with the sound because of it?

2029
02:25:10,152 --> 02:25:11,113
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really cool.

2030
02:25:11,253 --> 02:25:13,234
[SPEAKER_08]: A chiptune artist named RushJet1.

2031
02:25:13,954 --> 02:25:15,574
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had his stuff on the station before.

2032
02:25:15,615 --> 02:25:16,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this guy.

2033
02:25:17,095 --> 02:25:22,297
[SPEAKER_08]: He has used the VR6 chip to remake the Mega Man 3 soundtrack.

2034
02:25:22,697 --> 02:25:25,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Mega Man 3 was already fucking awesome, right?

2035
02:25:25,498 --> 02:25:27,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so here's an example.

2036
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:30,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's Magnet Man's original theme.

2037
02:25:31,441 --> 02:25:32,121
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the original.

2038
02:25:39,898 --> 02:25:40,499
[SPEAKER_08]: A good song.

2039
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:41,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

2040
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:41,721
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2041
02:25:42,201 --> 02:25:45,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is Rush Jet One's VRC6 version.

2042
02:25:49,470 --> 02:25:50,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2043
02:26:02,658 --> 02:26:04,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little bit remixed, too.

2044
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:06,744
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't just take the original and overlay it.

2045
02:26:06,804 --> 02:26:08,706
[SPEAKER_08]: He just completely kind of redid it.

2046
02:26:09,227 --> 02:26:12,030
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really cool.

2047
02:26:12,251 --> 02:26:20,061
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually played through Mega Man 3 with the audio silenced, laid his tunes on top of the game footage.

2048
02:26:20,581 --> 02:26:23,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when he gets to Wiley's Castle, it even goes through.

2049
02:26:23,805 --> 02:26:26,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's awesome, this whole little video that's out there.

2050
02:26:27,290 --> 02:26:28,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Proto Man's theme, everything is there.

2051
02:26:29,513 --> 02:26:34,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can check that out at rushjet1.bandcamp.com where he distributes a lot of his stuff.

2052
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:35,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

2053
02:26:36,943 --> 02:26:37,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

2054
02:26:38,996 --> 02:26:47,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I mean, gosh, I want to go back and replay all these old games on a Famicom emulator just to hear how awesome the sounds were.

2055
02:26:47,061 --> 02:26:50,783
[SPEAKER_11]: You really should hear the differences between the different versions of The Legend of Zelda.

2056
02:26:51,684 --> 02:26:53,745
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is kind of night and day.

2057
02:26:54,125 --> 02:26:57,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2058
02:26:57,527 --> 02:26:59,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2059
02:27:00,489 --> 02:27:03,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And while we wait for some calls, let me see if I can bring that up here.

2060
02:27:04,386 --> 02:27:05,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that you can find it.

2061
02:27:05,627 --> 02:27:14,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's really just the fact that there was a little bit different instrumentalization on the two different ones, so... Let's see.

2062
02:27:19,652 --> 02:27:20,352
[SPEAKER_10]: The disc version.

2063
02:27:20,533 --> 02:27:21,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is the disc version.

2064
02:27:26,915 --> 02:27:28,556
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going through the title screen and all that stuff.

2065
02:27:28,696 --> 02:27:28,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2066
02:27:28,876 --> 02:27:28,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2067
02:27:33,487 --> 02:27:33,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Normal.

2068
02:27:33,988 --> 02:27:34,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

2069
02:27:35,149 --> 02:27:36,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we'd have to get to, like, the dungeon.

2070
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:37,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me fast forward a little bit.

2071
02:27:38,332 --> 02:27:39,353
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a lot richer.

2072
02:27:39,413 --> 02:27:39,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

2073
02:27:39,873 --> 02:27:41,495
[SPEAKER_08]: You can even hear an extra little ding.

2074
02:27:42,296 --> 02:27:44,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if we can get to the dungeon.

2075
02:27:46,119 --> 02:27:46,500
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

2076
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:47,641
[SPEAKER_08]: You hear the difference in the sound?

2077
02:27:47,661 --> 02:27:48,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2078
02:27:52,161 --> 02:27:55,283
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's mostly, it's not so much music, but it's a sound effect.

2079
02:27:55,303 --> 02:27:56,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you can hear it in that.

2080
02:27:56,463 --> 02:28:01,486
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually, if it had allowed to play through the intro, it would have sounded different.

2081
02:28:01,626 --> 02:28:01,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Neat.

2082
02:28:01,826 --> 02:28:03,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me go to the phones, because we're getting some calls.

2083
02:28:03,667 --> 02:28:04,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2084
02:28:04,587 --> 02:28:05,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2085
02:28:06,168 --> 02:28:07,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, it's Panaxium.

2086
02:28:07,168 --> 02:28:08,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, oh, another video caller.

2087
02:28:08,949 --> 02:28:10,010
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Panaxium?

2088
02:28:10,710 --> 02:28:10,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

2089
02:28:11,250 --> 02:28:12,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you can't see me, but I'm waving.

2090
02:28:14,699 --> 02:28:15,139
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

2091
02:28:15,379 --> 02:28:17,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, you're a special, special person.

2092
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:17,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

2093
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:19,020
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2094
02:28:19,241 --> 02:28:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually calling to see if you guys had heard of Starbound.

2095
02:28:23,342 --> 02:28:24,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Starbound.

2096
02:28:24,242 --> 02:28:24,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

2097
02:28:25,463 --> 02:28:27,923
[SPEAKER_08]: This has to be like an Earthbound fan sequel, right?

2098
02:28:28,904 --> 02:28:29,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no.

2099
02:28:29,484 --> 02:28:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the spiritual successor to Terraria.

2100
02:28:31,925 --> 02:28:32,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2101
02:28:32,665 --> 02:28:33,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2102
02:28:33,645 --> 02:28:34,426
[SPEAKER_04]: No, tell me about it.

2103
02:28:34,526 --> 02:28:35,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me more.

2104
02:28:36,082 --> 02:28:44,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually going to be set very sci-fi, so you're going to be able to visit other planets and stuff, and each planet's going to have a different ecosystem and monsters and things like that.

2105
02:28:45,167 --> 02:28:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So far it looks like it's going to be really cool.

2106
02:28:46,929 --> 02:28:47,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Terraria.

2107
02:28:47,629 --> 02:28:49,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys had a chance to try it.

2108
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:50,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I have tried it.

2109
02:28:50,491 --> 02:28:52,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer Minecraft, I've got to say.

2110
02:28:52,812 --> 02:28:56,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Terraria really did not tell me what to do.

2111
02:28:56,954 --> 02:28:58,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to get into it and could not.

2112
02:28:58,494 --> 02:29:03,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I went back and played it after I enjoyed Minecraft and I was like, alright, I see why people get into this.

2113
02:29:03,916 --> 02:29:08,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's like, if Minecraft were on the Super Nintendo, this is what it would be.

2114
02:29:09,457 --> 02:29:10,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was pretty cool.

2115
02:29:11,397 --> 02:29:12,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

2116
02:29:12,297 --> 02:29:18,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new ones, they have the graphics, they have the variety of things you can get and do and different races you can play as.

2117
02:29:19,079 --> 02:29:20,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems really cool.

2118
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it by the same people who did the original Terraria?

2119
02:29:24,201 --> 02:29:25,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the same group.

2120
02:29:25,782 --> 02:29:26,783
[SPEAKER_04]: They've expanded it though.

2121
02:29:26,803 --> 02:29:27,923
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more people working on it.

2122
02:29:28,243 --> 02:29:28,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.

2123
02:29:30,204 --> 02:29:34,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm glad the first game worked out so well for them that they can actually do a sequel.

2124
02:29:34,246 --> 02:29:34,927
[SPEAKER_08]: That's got to be good.

2125
02:29:36,828 --> 02:29:41,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually led me to a question and I thought I'd kind of pass it along to you guys to get your opinion.

2126
02:29:41,830 --> 02:29:42,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2127
02:29:43,431 --> 02:29:50,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that this will ever move from being an indie type game with like Minecraft and Terraria towards being a big project game?

2128
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:54,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything's possible in this day and age.

2129
02:29:55,043 --> 02:30:02,849
[SPEAKER_08]: You see things like the Gianna Sisters game started as a Project Greenlight thing and now it's an Xbox Live Arcade.

2130
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:06,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose a lot of it is what do the developers want?

2131
02:30:07,053 --> 02:30:08,654
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they kind of willing to do?

2132
02:30:09,315 --> 02:30:10,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes people...

2133
02:30:11,036 --> 02:30:15,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't really want to play by the rules that systems like Xbox Live and so forth might set out.

2134
02:30:16,598 --> 02:30:23,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've all heard the stories before about the patching on Xbox Live and how it costs all this money if you want to do a patch beyond the first one.

2135
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:25,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really turned some people off.

2136
02:30:26,221 --> 02:30:28,001
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't patch Fez because of it, right?

2137
02:30:28,161 --> 02:30:28,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's too expensive.

2138
02:30:28,961 --> 02:30:30,522
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole big thing behind it.

2139
02:30:31,022 --> 02:30:34,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Nintendo's changing that up a little bit.

2140
02:30:34,345 --> 02:30:35,806
[SPEAKER_08]: We reported on that a couple weeks ago.

2141
02:30:35,866 --> 02:30:38,107
[SPEAKER_08]: We have yet to see the impact of that, if it works.

2142
02:30:38,528 --> 02:30:44,472
[SPEAKER_08]: But Nintendo's really trying to woo the indies towards Wii U by not charging a fee for any of that stuff.

2143
02:30:45,313 --> 02:30:49,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So it could be very interesting to see kind of where they'll end up.

2144
02:30:49,956 --> 02:31:11,358
[SPEAKER_08]: um I guess at the end of the day it just depends I mean do they think they can create the gaming experience they want on those systems I don't know I seem to remember Terraria made pretty good use of the keyboard so maybe they're worried about putting the uh controller into that environment I don't know but um

2145
02:31:13,039 --> 02:31:24,925
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a risk worth taking but they have to decide if financially it's one that they'll get the downloads from but if the community demands it you never know what might happen

2146
02:31:26,124 --> 02:31:26,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

2147
02:31:26,905 --> 02:31:32,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those cooperative collaboration games where you're building and exploring together, those are my kind of game.

2148
02:31:32,749 --> 02:31:37,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I always liked them, so I'm hoping that they get more exposure and more games made in that style.

2149
02:31:37,252 --> 02:31:42,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and that's the type of stuff that seems to really do well on Xbox Live Indie games, too, is all the Minecraft clones.

2150
02:31:43,016 --> 02:31:46,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you look at the top games, like, half of them are Minecraft clones.

2151
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:47,280
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

2152
02:31:48,821 --> 02:31:49,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2153
02:31:49,061 --> 02:31:49,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2154
02:31:50,491 --> 02:31:55,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what I had called about and just wanted to call in and say hi.

2155
02:31:55,754 --> 02:32:00,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hello, and thank you for alerting us to a game we ought to be keeping our eyes on.

2156
02:32:01,077 --> 02:32:03,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll go ahead and post the link to their website in the chat.

2157
02:32:03,919 --> 02:32:04,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2158
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:06,641
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.

2159
02:32:06,681 --> 02:32:07,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

2160
02:32:08,742 --> 02:32:15,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Panaxium, everybody, on our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2161
02:32:19,229 --> 02:32:20,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking up Link to the Past right now.

2162
02:32:22,010 --> 02:32:23,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, no, Link to the Past is the Super Nintendo one.

2163
02:32:23,631 --> 02:32:24,331
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have been different.

2164
02:32:24,351 --> 02:32:25,772
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the Adventures of Link?

2165
02:32:25,792 --> 02:32:27,753
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the second game?

2166
02:32:29,633 --> 02:32:30,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Of Link.

2167
02:32:30,694 --> 02:32:32,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Live radio, boys and girls.

2168
02:32:32,995 --> 02:32:33,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2169
02:32:33,655 --> 02:32:35,316
[SPEAKER_08]: The Adventure of Link title.

2170
02:32:35,856 --> 02:32:36,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2171
02:32:37,997 --> 02:32:40,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wow, even the little... That does... That sounds different too.

2172
02:32:40,538 --> 02:32:44,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2173
02:32:51,235 --> 02:32:54,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I always knew the Famicom games sounded different.

2174
02:32:54,256 --> 02:33:00,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew about this chip and all that stuff, you know, just as, you know, keeping my finger on the gaming community pulse as long as I have been.

2175
02:33:00,079 --> 02:33:00,719
[SPEAKER_08]: You knew about this stuff.

2176
02:33:00,759 --> 02:33:03,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I never really sat down to the time to listen to some of this stuff.

2177
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:11,204
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

2178
02:33:11,224 --> 02:33:12,945
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

2179
02:33:14,025 --> 02:33:15,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2180
02:33:15,066 --> 02:33:15,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2181
02:33:16,186 --> 02:33:17,307
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the one and only Ranma.

2182
02:33:17,707 --> 02:33:19,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Ranma, what's up, buddy?

2183
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:26,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want you to know, for the first time in the history of calling this show, you guys have derailed me from what I wanted to talk about.

2184
02:33:27,004 --> 02:33:27,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

2185
02:33:27,864 --> 02:33:28,125
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2186
02:33:29,245 --> 02:33:29,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Rush Jet 1.

2187
02:33:30,186 --> 02:33:32,147
[SPEAKER_05]: After hearing that music, I went straight to the Googles.

2188
02:33:34,368 --> 02:33:35,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty awesome, isn't it?

2189
02:33:36,329 --> 02:33:39,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You have no idea, especially with the fact that I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.

2190
02:33:39,952 --> 02:33:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be filling this up on my phone tonight.

2191
02:33:42,314 --> 02:33:43,414
[SPEAKER_05]: He's good, too.

2192
02:33:43,574 --> 02:33:44,575
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a lot of stuff.

2193
02:33:44,615 --> 02:33:49,519
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a track that I think we have in rotation on VOG, actually.

2194
02:33:50,039 --> 02:33:55,483
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on the old Orange, because I went through the old Orange Lounge Radio files when we were putting together VOG's initial playlist.

2195
02:33:55,503 --> 02:34:00,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously we want a mixture of geek stuff as well as the video game stuff in there.

2196
02:34:00,527 --> 02:34:05,371
[SPEAKER_08]: But we actually had, oh shit, now that I'm talking about it, of course I can't find it.

2197
02:34:05,951 --> 02:34:32,397
[SPEAKER_11]: but we actually had in there a track it was called I think it was Kanamized was the name of the song I'm going to see if I can find it while we're talking here I'll play a little clip of it but it was awesome by the way Jason also suggested finding the Hyrule Castle Famicom version from Zelda 2 oh I've heard that one it is phenomenal that's pretty amazing I don't even like Zelda 2 that much but I love the music in it actually Zelda 2 is my favorite one because believe it or not that was the first Zelda game I ever played

2198
02:34:34,353 --> 02:34:35,934
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one for me was the first one.

2199
02:34:36,174 --> 02:34:38,834
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just didn't like the side-scrolling aspect.

2200
02:34:38,874 --> 02:34:41,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm not going to whine because it was hard.

2201
02:34:41,755 --> 02:34:43,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the game was really freaking hard.

2202
02:34:44,116 --> 02:34:45,536
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was just the style.

2203
02:34:46,156 --> 02:34:47,177
[SPEAKER_11]: It just didn't seem quite right.

2204
02:34:47,197 --> 02:34:49,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also looked like Link was stabbing people with his cock.

2205
02:34:51,398 --> 02:34:52,458
[SPEAKER_11]: The downward thrust.

2206
02:34:52,518 --> 02:34:52,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2207
02:34:54,358 --> 02:34:54,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

2208
02:34:55,959 --> 02:34:57,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in puberty.

2209
02:34:57,839 --> 02:34:58,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew what those were.

2210
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

2211
02:35:01,368 --> 02:35:03,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So what else did you call in to talk about tonight?

2212
02:35:03,471 --> 02:35:04,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Just Rush Jet?

2213
02:35:05,695 --> 02:35:08,138
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was out earlier so I mishapped the show.

2214
02:35:08,219 --> 02:35:08,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

2215
02:35:09,721 --> 02:35:10,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Shame on you.

2216
02:35:10,642 --> 02:35:11,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

2217
02:35:12,926 --> 02:35:13,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Two quick things.

2218
02:35:14,288 --> 02:35:15,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about what's happening to G4?

2219
02:35:17,148 --> 02:35:18,089
[SPEAKER_08]: The Esquire thing?

2220
02:35:18,129 --> 02:35:18,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2221
02:35:20,150 --> 02:35:30,816
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have missed it when we were talking about it, but another podcast, The Nerdist with Chris Hardwick, Alan informed me that they were talking about that it's actually like Brovo is what the network's basically going to be.

2222
02:35:31,116 --> 02:35:35,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were coming up with a joke, The Real Dude Bros of Orange County might be a show.

2223
02:35:36,339 --> 02:35:38,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like Hipster Spike TV.

2224
02:35:41,862 --> 02:35:42,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2225
02:35:42,323 --> 02:35:46,105
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think the Esquire channel will end up being?

2226
02:35:47,409 --> 02:35:48,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2227
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:50,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I want to know.

2228
02:35:50,611 --> 02:35:53,373
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be funny nonetheless to see the end results.

2229
02:35:53,613 --> 02:35:54,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the other question.

2230
02:35:54,714 --> 02:35:55,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you care?

2231
02:35:56,635 --> 02:35:57,276
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

2232
02:35:58,176 --> 02:36:00,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's that song, by the way, that's in rotation on VOG.

2233
02:36:00,378 --> 02:36:00,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it.

2234
02:36:10,543 --> 02:36:10,703
[SPEAKER_08]: MagFest

2235
02:36:38,547 --> 02:36:40,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is.

2236
02:36:41,229 --> 02:36:44,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this about Mag the game on Sony or no?

2237
02:36:45,291 --> 02:36:48,272
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a four-day gaming convention.

2238
02:36:48,793 --> 02:36:49,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2239
02:36:49,973 --> 02:36:50,874
[SPEAKER_05]: All types of video games.

2240
02:36:51,034 --> 02:36:52,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm checking the guest list.

2241
02:36:52,275 --> 02:36:53,695
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some interesting people here.

2242
02:36:54,356 --> 02:36:59,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just say there's somebody here where we may have to ship DarkSakura over to DC for it.

2243
02:36:59,619 --> 02:37:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

2244
02:37:00,699 --> 02:37:01,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's going to pay for the ticket?

2245
02:37:04,087 --> 02:37:04,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my ways.

2246
02:37:06,370 --> 02:37:09,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what's the talent that's going to be there?

2247
02:37:09,795 --> 02:37:12,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a couple of names here we've heard on the show, like John St.

2248
02:37:12,679 --> 02:37:14,141
[SPEAKER_05]: John and Eric Ruth Games.

2249
02:37:14,642 --> 02:37:15,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I definitely know John St.

2250
02:37:16,004 --> 02:37:16,264
[SPEAKER_08]: John.

2251
02:37:16,284 --> 02:37:16,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, yep.

2252
02:37:18,098 --> 02:37:24,840
[SPEAKER_05]: And since you mentioned Castlevania earlier, Kinuyo Yamashita, composer for Castlevania.

2253
02:37:25,961 --> 02:37:26,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

2254
02:37:26,761 --> 02:37:26,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2255
02:37:27,421 --> 02:37:27,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2256
02:37:28,682 --> 02:37:30,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And can I get a drumroll, please?

2257
02:37:33,563 --> 02:37:34,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yuzo Koshiro.

2258
02:37:34,764 --> 02:37:37,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2259
02:37:37,805 --> 02:37:38,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

2260
02:37:38,165 --> 02:37:39,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a huge Yuzo Koshiro fan.

2261
02:37:39,925 --> 02:37:40,725
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

2262
02:37:41,546 --> 02:37:43,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have one spot left in our room.

2263
02:37:44,527 --> 02:37:44,947
[SPEAKER_05]: When is it?

2264
02:37:46,124 --> 02:37:47,205
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in line for press.

2265
02:38:06,824 --> 02:38:07,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2266
02:38:07,244 --> 02:38:09,565
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says MagFest is amazing.

2267
02:38:09,965 --> 02:38:11,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Brentalfloss has been there the last few years.

2268
02:38:12,466 --> 02:38:15,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and they also call this con Drinkfest.

2269
02:38:15,507 --> 02:38:17,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I have to explain why.

2270
02:38:18,127 --> 02:38:19,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't imagine why.

2271
02:38:19,128 --> 02:38:22,869
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason why they're walking around with styrofoam containers.

2272
02:38:23,349 --> 02:38:25,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully I make it out there for PAX East.

2273
02:38:25,209 --> 02:38:25,830
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2274
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:26,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still trying.

2275
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:30,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to wait for them to open up the media registration to see if we can make that work.

2276
02:38:32,147 --> 02:38:34,708
[SPEAKER_05]: My entire staff, we got our badges in advance.

2277
02:38:35,209 --> 02:38:36,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to apply for press.

2278
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:41,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we get pressed, then we'll just pass the badges on to somebody else or whoever.

2279
02:38:41,933 --> 02:38:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2280
02:38:42,654 --> 02:38:43,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Paying it forward.

2281
02:38:44,275 --> 02:38:45,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Got that shit right.

2282
02:38:46,076 --> 02:38:46,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, buddy.

2283
02:38:46,556 --> 02:38:47,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

2284
02:38:48,558 --> 02:38:49,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, man.

2285
02:38:49,138 --> 02:38:49,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2286
02:38:49,839 --> 02:38:50,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun at MAGFest.

2287
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:51,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Will do.

2288
02:38:52,952 --> 02:38:59,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I've basically been told that basically, yes, I am being forced at gunpoint to go to DragonCon next year.

2289
02:38:59,134 --> 02:39:00,355
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's like a thing.

2290
02:39:00,695 --> 02:39:04,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been told if you want to go to PAX, you better go to PAX East because you ain't going to PAX Prime.

2291
02:39:05,677 --> 02:39:06,017
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2292
02:39:06,417 --> 02:39:06,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

2293
02:39:06,818 --> 02:39:12,840
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2294
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:19,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, if you're in the southeast part of the country, you might want to make plans on DragonCon because there's like a lot of VOG stuff going on at DragonCon next year.

2295
02:39:19,603 --> 02:39:20,463
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I can really say.

2296
02:39:23,689 --> 02:39:30,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Launch Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR Loki, I can go to you for last minute stories, but I can also do the Twitter topics.

2297
02:39:31,031 --> 02:39:32,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got last minute stories if you want them.

2298
02:39:32,452 --> 02:39:32,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go for it.

2299
02:39:33,592 --> 02:39:39,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to the PlayStation Network probably next week.

2300
02:39:40,294 --> 02:39:47,716
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dated for December 12th in Hong Kong, I believe.

2301
02:39:47,756 --> 02:39:49,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the English version there.

2302
02:39:49,597 --> 02:39:58,065
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it has been also confirmed on the Drop, which is the PlayStation Blog's little bit where they talk about stuff that's coming out.

2303
02:39:58,646 --> 02:40:01,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And next week, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas PS2 Classic.

2304
02:40:02,109 --> 02:40:05,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fantastic that that's going to be coming out.

2305
02:40:06,974 --> 02:40:13,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there's been some Linux system requirements popping up on Steam for some games that haven't really been announced yet.

2306
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:23,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Serious Sam BFE's Linux requirements have been on there, and also some more of the, I guess, a few Greenlight games as well.

2307
02:40:24,088 --> 02:40:31,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So, perhaps more evidence that they're really working towards that Steam version, or the Linux version of Steam for the Steam box.

2308
02:40:31,093 --> 02:40:31,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2309
02:40:32,154 --> 02:40:32,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Be interesting.

2310
02:40:32,814 --> 02:40:37,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, the next Assassin's Creed is going to be in Brazil.

2311
02:40:38,416 --> 02:40:40,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And this has been actually confirmed.

2312
02:40:40,157 --> 02:40:48,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess GameSpot says they verified the translation that the next chapter is supposed to be held in Brazil.

2313
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:51,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was coming from Ubisoft Brazil.

2314
02:40:53,142 --> 02:40:53,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine that.

2315
02:40:54,002 --> 02:40:55,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that their next game is going to be there.

2316
02:40:56,143 --> 02:41:00,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, it would be perfect for them to be working on it in some capacity.

2317
02:41:02,776 --> 02:41:03,817
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2318
02:41:03,857 --> 02:41:04,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to some Twitter topics.

2319
02:41:04,958 --> 02:41:05,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh.

2320
02:41:05,698 --> 02:41:05,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2321
02:41:06,138 --> 02:41:07,219
[SPEAKER_08]: One last thing real quick.

2322
02:41:07,399 --> 02:41:10,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype.

2323
02:41:10,782 --> 02:41:19,668
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned on my Twitter this week, I am very disappointed to announce that Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable has been canceled in the U.S.

2324
02:41:20,569 --> 02:41:47,238
[SPEAKER_06]: at least the retail release of it now that doesn't rule out that they could be doing a digital only version which would make sense because the Vita not doing so great and a game that's kind of niche like Earth Defense Force may not sell very well as far as releasing at retail DJ Max Technica just came out on Vita this week and it's apparently easier to get on the digital store than it is to get a physical copy yeah so that might be might be why

2325
02:41:48,022 --> 02:41:49,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the phones because you have a call coming in.

2326
02:41:49,683 --> 02:41:50,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2327
02:41:50,604 --> 02:41:50,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2328
02:41:53,946 --> 02:41:55,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Ragenator.

2329
02:41:55,567 --> 02:41:56,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Ragenator.

2330
02:41:56,528 --> 02:41:57,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And look, another video.

2331
02:41:57,728 --> 02:42:01,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that the callers are actually listening to the request for more video.

2332
02:42:01,671 --> 02:42:02,291
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, buddy?

2333
02:42:04,312 --> 02:42:04,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much.

2334
02:42:05,873 --> 02:42:10,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a couple of questions for you.

2335
02:42:10,536 --> 02:42:10,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

2336
02:42:11,957 --> 02:42:15,279
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I know that Rams...

2337
02:42:17,312 --> 02:42:19,393
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of a legal gray area.

2338
02:42:19,913 --> 02:42:34,197
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that emulators, assuming that you have, let's say, Final Fantasy XII for the PS2, you actually own the game, are you allowed to use an emulator to play the game?

2339
02:42:36,161 --> 02:42:38,944
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2340
02:42:52,981 --> 02:42:57,462
[SPEAKER_08]: and you use an emulator to play that backup copy, I believe you're okay.

2341
02:42:58,022 --> 02:43:03,163
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you downloaded said copy from the internet, technically that's where you're in the legal gray area.

2342
02:43:03,583 --> 02:43:07,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to end up on Judge Judy and spend time behind bars because of it?

2343
02:43:07,644 --> 02:43:08,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

2344
02:43:09,305 --> 02:43:10,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

2345
02:43:10,705 --> 02:43:15,426
[SPEAKER_08]: But are you being 100% legal?

2346
02:43:15,946 --> 02:43:18,526
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a law-abiding citizen by every step of the way?

2347
02:43:18,887 --> 02:43:19,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

2348
02:43:20,267 --> 02:43:20,527
[SPEAKER_08]: But

2349
02:43:21,327 --> 02:43:34,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I think ethically, if you want to ask kind of the ethical question, if you own the game, then yes, you ought to be able to have the emulator and do whatever crazy things you want to do with the hacking and so forth.

2350
02:43:34,191 --> 02:43:38,452
[SPEAKER_08]: You paid your money to support the developers and get the game and so forth.

2351
02:43:38,792 --> 02:43:39,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Have at you.

2352
02:43:39,472 --> 02:43:40,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Do what you want with it.

2353
02:43:40,453 --> 02:43:41,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I think ethically you're okay.

2354
02:43:42,898 --> 02:43:49,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I brought it up because I still have a lot of games on desk.

2355
02:43:49,186 --> 02:43:50,207
[SPEAKER_00]: I got laying around.

2356
02:43:50,267 --> 02:43:53,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the things back in August did not scale everything.

2357
02:43:54,032 --> 02:43:57,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got my Final Fantasy XII and I've been dying to beat the game

2358
02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:28,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Legally, yeah, but ethically, I think you're okay.

2359
02:44:28,944 --> 02:44:44,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just kind of figured, you know, if there was something out there that, you know, programmed it, well, mimicked the hardware, I mean, if I actually popped the disc into my computer's DVD drive, the original disc, you know, basically turned my computer into a PS2, um,

2360
02:44:46,781 --> 02:44:49,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't totally sure if it would be legal or not.

2361
02:44:49,242 --> 02:44:51,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to get myself into trouble.

2362
02:44:52,264 --> 02:44:53,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you'll be fine.

2363
02:44:53,164 --> 02:44:54,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody listens to this show.

2364
02:44:54,305 --> 02:44:54,905
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the good news.

2365
02:44:56,446 --> 02:45:03,110
[SPEAKER_08]: On the PlayStation 2, didn't you have that hard drive backup thing where you could load all the games to the drive and play them off the drive and it worked fine?

2366
02:45:03,430 --> 02:45:04,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was.

2367
02:45:05,011 --> 02:45:05,431
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not you.

2368
02:45:05,451 --> 02:45:05,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

2369
02:45:05,731 --> 02:45:07,092
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Loki, not you, Reginator.

2370
02:45:07,112 --> 02:45:07,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2371
02:45:07,552 --> 02:45:09,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was the HD loader that they had.

2372
02:45:09,494 --> 02:45:10,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the HD loader.

2373
02:45:10,554 --> 02:45:13,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if it's games you own, that's fine.

2374
02:45:13,136 --> 02:45:19,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're renting games, dumping them and then shipping them back, that's ethically shame, shame, slap on the wrist.

2375
02:45:19,622 --> 02:45:19,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2376
02:45:19,882 --> 02:45:21,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyway, sorry, Reginator.

2377
02:45:22,144 --> 02:45:31,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I don't see, at least with what you were just talking about, you know, even then, how many games are going to put onto that PS2 hard drive?

2378
02:45:31,251 --> 02:45:32,852
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only a 60 gigabyte hard drive, or

2379
02:45:37,419 --> 02:45:38,980
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch that out, 40 gigabyte.

2380
02:45:39,701 --> 02:45:46,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average, what, PS2 game was about, I'd say no more than 8 gigs.

2381
02:45:47,385 --> 02:45:50,667
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you hack things to get the 500 gig hard drive to work.

2382
02:45:52,008 --> 02:45:53,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Which you can also do on the Wii.

2383
02:45:55,710 --> 02:46:04,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I kind of touched on over the past month or two is that now that I don't have any consoles anymore,

2384
02:46:04,988 --> 02:46:22,372
[SPEAKER_00]: any more, thanks to these, I've been getting into PC games, and at least temporarily I've been using games for Windows Live in the marketplace, because I have a pre-existing account through Microsoft when I have my 360.

2385
02:46:25,053 --> 02:46:33,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that compared to, say, Xbox Live in their marketplace, there's hardly any

2386
02:46:36,695 --> 02:46:40,208
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of better term, meaty games like, let's say, uh,

2387
02:46:41,397 --> 02:46:49,679
[SPEAKER_00]: The Duels of Planes, Focker's Games, there's no Geometry Wars, no... That's why it failed, sir.

2388
02:46:49,779 --> 02:46:52,099
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it unfortunately has failed.

2389
02:46:52,319 --> 02:47:01,881
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, what you see there is probably all that's going to be there because now it's all about the Windows 8 marketplace is where the future focus is going to be.

2390
02:47:02,401 --> 02:47:06,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I think games for Windows is sadly a thing of the past.

2391
02:47:07,022 --> 02:47:09,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that being said, right now my computer has Windows 7 Home Premium installed.

2392
02:47:09,844 --> 02:47:11,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, would you recommend, based on what you know about

2393
02:47:42,922 --> 02:47:45,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't used it, so it's hard for me to say.

2394
02:47:45,404 --> 02:47:48,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't say, yes, you should upgrade, but I'm not using it myself.

2395
02:47:49,248 --> 02:47:56,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I will tell you my hesitation is that I want to see how the compatibility looks with Windows 8 and kind of what the complaints are about it.

2396
02:47:56,616 --> 02:47:58,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

2397
02:47:59,179 --> 02:48:05,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of my friends that are using it, this is kind of the bottom line that I've heard from people that are using it right now.

2398
02:48:06,226 --> 02:48:09,290
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're on something before 7, then upgrade.

2399
02:48:09,870 --> 02:48:16,758
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're on 7, there's a few little perks, but it's not something you gotta get right now.

2400
02:48:17,258 --> 02:48:17,679
[SPEAKER_08]: It can wait.

2401
02:48:19,881 --> 02:48:20,121
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2402
02:48:20,241 --> 02:48:20,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

2403
02:48:21,002 --> 02:48:21,722
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, RageNator.

2404
02:48:21,903 --> 02:48:23,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to let you go so we can wrap things up.

2405
02:48:23,744 --> 02:48:26,326
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you so much for the call, and thank you for the video.

2406
02:48:27,087 --> 02:48:27,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, no problem.

2407
02:48:27,747 --> 02:48:28,568
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, take care, buddy.

2408
02:48:29,429 --> 02:48:29,949
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, bye-bye.

2409
02:48:30,029 --> 02:48:30,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2410
02:48:31,290 --> 02:48:33,032
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2411
02:48:34,313 --> 02:48:36,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to all our callers for calling in.

2412
02:48:36,755 --> 02:48:40,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we have the router and that the stream's not dropping, I think we need to get a studio cam back.

2413
02:48:40,838 --> 02:48:42,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that might be something we need to do.

2414
02:48:42,719 --> 02:48:44,421
[SPEAKER_08]: That way we can look at the listeners when they're calling.

2415
02:48:45,001 --> 02:48:51,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that is not going to do it just yet because I need to get to the Twitter topics, but that is going to do it for the Skype line.

2416
02:48:51,967 --> 02:49:02,094
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't get through, email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Redertainment tweeted us earlier and said, OLR, the Grammys ended with an award.

2417
02:49:02,635 --> 02:49:04,236
[SPEAKER_08]: The Emmys ended with an award.

2418
02:49:04,556 --> 02:49:06,258
[SPEAKER_08]: The Oscars ended an award.

2419
02:49:06,958 --> 02:49:10,941
[SPEAKER_08]: The VGAs ended with Tenacious D. What the fuck?

2420
02:49:12,222 --> 02:49:13,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that's a good ending.

2421
02:49:14,944 --> 02:49:16,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Unpopular opinion time.

2422
02:49:17,445 --> 02:49:19,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Tenacious D is super overrated.

2423
02:49:19,926 --> 02:49:20,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they're that good.

2424
02:49:22,467 --> 02:49:23,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I caused Jamie to choke.

2425
02:49:23,848 --> 02:49:24,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

2426
02:49:24,808 --> 02:49:26,249
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the latke caused me to choke.

2427
02:49:26,709 --> 02:49:27,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's unpopular opinion.

2428
02:49:27,990 --> 02:49:29,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get hate mail.

2429
02:49:29,331 --> 02:49:33,032
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, when you reheat the latkes, do it on the stove.

2430
02:49:36,074 --> 02:49:36,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor Jamie.

2431
02:49:36,954 --> 02:49:37,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you give me all right?

2432
02:49:37,594 --> 02:49:39,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you need water?

2433
02:49:39,155 --> 02:49:41,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2434
02:49:41,196 --> 02:49:41,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2435
02:49:43,405 --> 02:49:47,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need an ambulance to interrupt an episode of Orange Lounge Radio either.

2436
02:49:47,155 --> 02:49:48,238
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't had evacuation.

2437
02:49:48,258 --> 02:49:50,564
[SPEAKER_08]: She's putting the hack in Hanukkah.

2438
02:49:55,830 --> 02:49:58,252
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw sent us a story lead here.

2439
02:49:58,792 --> 02:50:03,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Bronies shut down their My Little Pony MMO, blaming copyright law.

2440
02:50:05,357 --> 02:50:08,179
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what got shut down today, actually?

2441
02:50:08,259 --> 02:50:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2442
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:13,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the largest indexers for Usenet.

2443
02:50:14,303 --> 02:50:16,084
[SPEAKER_08]: People still use Usenet?

2444
02:50:16,985 --> 02:50:19,007
[SPEAKER_08]: For any legitimate purpose whatsoever?

2445
02:50:19,027 --> 02:50:19,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2446
02:50:19,867 --> 02:50:21,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

2447
02:50:22,168 --> 02:50:23,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Hence why those sites are getting shut down.

2448
02:50:24,369 --> 02:50:25,449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's legit.

2449
02:50:25,589 --> 02:50:28,410
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when Usenet was actually a chap for them.

2450
02:50:28,430 --> 02:50:28,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It's legit.

2451
02:50:28,770 --> 02:50:31,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's totally not pirated stuff on there.

2452
02:50:32,451 --> 02:50:38,053
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, NZB Matrix and Newsbin 2 got shut down.

2453
02:50:39,813 --> 02:50:42,075
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so back to the brony story.

2454
02:50:42,496 --> 02:50:48,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Some brony developers were putting together My Little Pony Online, but a cease and desist came in from Hasbro.

2455
02:50:49,483 --> 02:50:50,684
[SPEAKER_08]: But they pressed ahead.

2456
02:50:51,124 --> 02:50:57,050
[SPEAKER_08]: They said, screw it, and they moved forward, and they released the game's first episode a month ago.

2457
02:50:57,731 --> 02:51:03,873
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Hasbro's lawyers sent down a shutdown demand to HLP Online.

2458
02:51:04,593 --> 02:51:10,454
[SPEAKER_08]: The team put out a statement, it's very carefully worded, not blaming Hasbro through the shutdown.

2459
02:51:10,934 --> 02:51:14,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, Hasbro is not to be blamed here, they wrote.

2460
02:51:14,735 --> 02:51:16,676
[SPEAKER_08]: As per US trademark law...

2461
02:51:17,256 --> 02:51:22,057
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as an infringement comes to light, they are obligated to defend the trademark or they will lose it.

2462
02:51:22,397 --> 02:51:27,338
[SPEAKER_08]: They had no choice in the matter, regardless of what they thought the project or how it benefited them.

2463
02:51:27,758 --> 02:51:29,858
[SPEAKER_08]: There was little we could do to work around it.

2464
02:51:30,158 --> 02:51:33,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Discussions continued through the month, but it came down to one fact.

2465
02:51:33,679 --> 02:51:35,900
[SPEAKER_08]: MLP Online had to come to an end.

2466
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:38,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's that whole... You know, we've heard this a couple times this year.

2467
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the whole gamer thing.

2468
02:51:41,381 --> 02:51:42,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when Reddit got sued or...

2469
02:51:43,681 --> 02:51:51,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Not sued yet, but the cease and desist went to Reddit over the gamer thing, where gamer.org had it, and then they said that Reddit had to stop using it.

2470
02:51:51,906 --> 02:51:57,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's really been resolved yet, but the guy was like, hey, I have a trademark, and I have to protect it.

2471
02:51:57,430 --> 02:52:00,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people are like, why were you given that trademark in the first place?

2472
02:52:01,613 --> 02:52:07,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is a little different, because we can all understand why Hasbro has a trademark on My Little Pony, but...

2473
02:52:10,098 --> 02:52:18,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma in chat, I know one of our resident bronies, says, I'm surprised that Hasbro sent a CND due to all the episodes floating around on YouTube.

2474
02:52:20,246 --> 02:52:23,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if Hasbro gets the magic button, those will all disappear real fast.

2475
02:52:24,029 --> 02:52:25,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people just talking about it.

2476
02:52:27,771 --> 02:52:30,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there Watch Me Get High and Watch My Little Pony videos on YouTube?

2477
02:52:31,294 --> 02:52:32,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, reaction videos?

2478
02:52:32,635 --> 02:52:33,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are.

2479
02:52:35,034 --> 02:52:35,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.

2480
02:52:36,996 --> 02:52:38,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Never choke on a latke, people.

2481
02:52:39,117 --> 02:52:44,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw tweets us to an article about Time's List of the Year, Gadget of the Year.

2482
02:52:45,122 --> 02:52:47,043
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii U, second place.

2483
02:52:47,784 --> 02:52:49,485
[SPEAKER_08]: First place for Gadget of the Year.

2484
02:52:50,166 --> 02:52:51,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you're going to love this.

2485
02:52:51,867 --> 02:52:52,568
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone 5.

2486
02:52:53,749 --> 02:52:55,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Time's Gadget of the Year.

2487
02:52:59,071 --> 02:53:00,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are tweets from Tigerclaw.

2488
02:53:00,914 --> 02:53:13,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, from SSJ100 Matt, people say LEGO City Undercover is like LEGO Grand Theft Auto, but someone made a LEGO version of the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer, and he links us to it.

2489
02:53:13,030 --> 02:53:13,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen this?

2490
02:53:13,570 --> 02:53:13,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it, yeah.

2491
02:53:13,951 --> 02:53:14,512
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think?

2492
02:53:15,272 --> 02:53:16,473
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2493
02:53:34,921 --> 02:53:49,369
[SPEAKER_06]: same fucking HUD same like everything as Grand Theft Auto so I wouldn't be surprised at one time that that was the thing that Rockstar was working on with them but now it's you know Traveler Tales or whatever whoever's putting it I think it's Traveler Tales when is that coming out?

2494
02:53:49,989 --> 02:53:54,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they have it it's supposed to be launch window so in the next three months could be anything

2495
02:53:55,663 --> 02:54:00,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, I mean, seriously, was it Wii Fit U now is the first half of next year instead of Launch Window?

2496
02:54:01,408 --> 02:54:03,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And the rest of this is all March.

2497
02:54:03,290 --> 02:54:05,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that is right there.

2498
02:54:06,272 --> 02:54:14,180
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been probably the only like if I were to pick up a Wii U, that would be the game I'd probably get is that Lego City Undercover because it actually looks pretty awesome.

2499
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:19,144
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's really the only game that's been kind of impressive to me is just that one.

2500
02:54:23,437 --> 02:54:24,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry for the dead air.

2501
02:54:24,117 --> 02:54:25,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just catching up on chat there.

2502
02:54:26,379 --> 02:54:27,499
[SPEAKER_08]: That is actually going to do it.

2503
02:54:27,519 --> 02:54:28,620
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it for Twitter topics.

2504
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:30,360
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you were done with last-minute stories, right?

2505
02:54:30,921 --> 02:54:31,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe I am.

2506
02:54:31,641 --> 02:54:35,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So that brings us to a close of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2507
02:54:35,703 --> 02:54:37,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Sad.

2508
02:54:37,504 --> 02:54:42,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we close up shop tonight.

2509
02:54:42,906 --> 02:54:44,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And my final thought, I'll start tonight.

2510
02:54:44,647 --> 02:54:47,529
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is F you to jelly beans.

2511
02:54:47,589 --> 02:54:48,389
[SPEAKER_08]: They're addicting too.

2512
02:54:49,410 --> 02:54:50,750
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2513
02:54:51,951 --> 02:54:52,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Latkes.

2514
02:54:53,351 --> 02:55:14,097
[SPEAKER_06]: and Loki, your final thought tonight check out the VOG Minecraft server if you haven't yet there's information in our forums on how to sign up basically just say hey I want to sign up put your username on there and I add you to the whitelist because now we have mob arena, it's kind of fun just to battle monsters and it's really fucking hard so

2515
02:55:14,997 --> 02:55:15,418
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2516
02:55:45,817 --> 02:55:51,419
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some usable classes because we're still tweaking the classes because some of them don't make any sense or don't work right.

2517
02:55:53,199 --> 02:55:58,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I'm done tweaking that and the waves and stuff like that because we had a problem at one time where it was just creepers spawning.

2518
02:55:58,740 --> 02:56:07,302
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just tons of fucking creepers and literally you would see you'd be watching up top and they have different waves.

2519
02:56:07,322 --> 02:56:12,704
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one called a swarm wave and all the creatures spawn one heart worth of health but it's a ton of them.

2520
02:56:12,764 --> 02:56:13,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of a sudden we saw like

2521
02:56:14,805 --> 02:56:16,927
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 creepers just spawned.

2522
02:56:17,348 --> 02:56:20,952
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, holy shit, there's a huge wave of creepers chasing after me.

2523
02:56:21,493 --> 02:56:22,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was kind of fun.

2524
02:56:25,404 --> 02:56:28,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackwolf says we also need a Forza Horizon night.

2525
02:56:28,106 --> 02:56:28,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be down for that.

2526
02:56:28,806 --> 02:56:34,190
[SPEAKER_08]: That's on my queue for game rental games, so I need to send Silent Hill back because I'm probably not going to play much more of it.

2527
02:56:34,330 --> 02:56:37,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to use a game for my steering wheel.

2528
02:56:37,833 --> 02:56:39,034
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fun to mess around with.

2529
02:56:39,054 --> 02:56:41,236
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what game I have sitting here waiting to play?

2530
02:56:41,276 --> 02:56:44,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get around to it for this week, but for next week on the PS3.

2531
02:56:44,158 --> 02:56:44,238
[SPEAKER_08]: XCOM.

2532
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:55,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I have from the rental guys waiting to play, so I'm excited to check that out.

2533
02:56:55,288 --> 02:57:02,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I was spending Thanksgiving with Spike from Game Buoy, if any of you listen to that show, which if you don't, you should.

2534
02:57:02,815 --> 02:57:04,416
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a fun duo there.

2535
02:57:04,857 --> 02:57:09,361
[SPEAKER_08]: But Spike was showing me XCOM on PC, and I played like a round of it, and it was fun.

2536
02:57:10,181 --> 02:57:10,362
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2537
02:57:12,386 --> 02:57:12,826
[SPEAKER_08]: My mouse died.

2538
02:57:33,587 --> 02:57:34,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it sucks.

2539
02:57:34,208 --> 02:57:34,468
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2540
02:57:35,349 --> 02:57:38,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.

2541

[SPEAKER_08]: If you like what you hear, please spread the word.

2542
02:57:40,873 --> 02:57:45,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio and help spread the word of independent podcasting.

2543
02:57:46,217 --> 02:57:51,682
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if you've listened to this episode and you've thought, eh, it sucks, at least support other independent podcasters.

2544
02:57:51,702 --> 02:57:54,524
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many people out there that work hard to put this out there.

2545
02:57:54,544 --> 02:57:58,887
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think it sucks, the more stars you give us, it means the worse you think the show is.

2546
02:57:59,968 --> 02:58:01,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, give us nice reviews on iTunes, please.

2547
02:58:02,450 --> 02:58:05,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And wherever you found this podcast, help us spread the word.

2548
02:58:06,373 --> 02:58:07,653
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, that's all we ask.

2549
02:58:09,154 --> 02:58:11,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy the world while it's still here, guys.

2550
02:58:11,416 --> 02:58:13,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next week to do it all again.

2551
02:58:13,037 --> 02:58:14,238
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, the apocalypse.

2552
02:58:14,958 --> 02:58:17,060
[SPEAKER_08]: With another episode of Orange Lounge Radio next week.

2553
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:17,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.
