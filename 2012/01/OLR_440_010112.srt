00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,360
Tonight, January 1st, 2012, DLC is finally coming to the 3DS, Valve says Half Life 3

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,920
rumors are just trolling and a fan remake of a computer game classic is released.

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,080
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,820
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. It is episode number 440 for this January

5
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,160
1st, 2012. Really easy day to remember. My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,360
over the next few hours to talk video games with my co-hosts, first off, the one, the

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,120
only, Jamie Summers. Or Dark Sakura, whatever you want to call her. How are you doing?

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:04,480
People get my name right. Bitter table for one. Not bitter. I'm judgmental. All right.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,960
Also joining us tonight, not joining us tonight. Sadly, I know this might surprise some people,

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,040
but Tech Master Loki unfortunately had to cancel on tonight's show. Unfortunately. Well,

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,680
you know, you miss him with every fiber of your being. No, I miss him with everything

12
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,540
I throw. He had a family engagement. I mean, it is technically a holiday, New Year's Day.

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,520
And so sometimes there's family stuff, especially with the new baby he's got. So they've got

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,100
a family thing going on. So he's not here tonight. That baby is not as new as that baby

15
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,860
once was. He better, he better have the baby thing down. That baby's getting older just

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,000
like you and you, but joining us tonight as he tends to do when we need another host,

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,400
please welcome to the studio. Alan, how you doing Alan? Hello. How are you? This is all

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,400
happening in my house right now. I need to get out. Yes. Um, here's the deal. If we sound

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
a little different tonight, we're kind of having to just adjust some audio on the fly

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,540
and that's because we're in a new studio and we talked about this when we were last on,

21
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,440
we did not have a show last week because it was on December 25th, which is a big holiday

22
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,360
for some people. Uh, and the week before that though was our last show. And, um, w that

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,280
was the last show from studio dark Sakura or the fifth studio in OLR's history. Yes.

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,980
But tonight we are in a new studio at studio six and it's from Alan and I's place. Yep.

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:27,080
So what, what's your grammar? What should be Alan and my house? How about shut and up?

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,160
Uh, how about bite my butt? Anyhow, unfortunately I was really hoping to surprise everybody

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,300
with the return of a webcam tonight, but it was just a bit pricey and, and logistically

28
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,400
a pain in the butt to set up, but we are set up very similar to, for those who've been

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,260
listening a long time, I believe it was the third, no second studio we were in, which

30
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,360
was when Loki and I lived together. It was a while ago, right? We actually did the show

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,740
kind of in the dining room and then the living room. There was antics that always happen.

32
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,040
That's kind of a similar setup to what we have going on right now in this studio six.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,540
So we're hoping at some point we can return the live streaming of games and stuff during

34
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,900
the show over one of them stream and video websites. We used to use Justin TV. I've done

35
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,200
stuff on Ustream. I don't know. I don't know which way we'd go. We'll figure that out when

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,720
we actually have video. I now have experience doing custom graphics for Justin for not for

37
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:18,940
Justin TV for a Ustream. So, Hey, yep. Awesome. I did them for you for Umlaut. All right.

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,480
Say hello to the chatters chat room dot orange lounge, excuse me, chat dot orange lounge

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,100
radio.com. I'm a little rusty after we got chat dot orange lounge radio.com is where

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,260
you can join us. Uh, if you want to talk live with us here on this new year's day and it

41
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,100
looks like we have a Bobby Black Wolf. Did he just join? How come Bobby could show up

42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,020
for our show, but he couldn't be bothered to do his own show tonight. No, that's because

43
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,720
he likes our show better. As, as I said to the all games chatters, Bobby didn't want

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,000
to work. He just wanted to bang on the drum all day because he, that's a joke because

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,400
he does drumming. He does drumming stuff for the Atlanta Falcons. So my mother is calling

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,960
me on my cell phone right now. Like, doesn't she know I have a radio show on Sunday nights?

47
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,700
Doesn't she know? Maybe she's listening. Rob, what do you mean you moved the show to your

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,820
house? Rob, did that cost money? Rob, Rob. And you know, we are live of course, Sunday

49
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,760
nights, every Sunday night, even when it's new year's day at all games radio is the kind

50
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,260
and gracious network that allows us to steal their bandwidth no matter what studio we're

51
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,480
in. Www dot all games.com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern. Typically after the

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Bobby Black Wolf show when he's, you know, not off drumming tonight after the show, our

53
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,240
nine cast, they had a jumbo episode cause they are usually on it for Pacific and they

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,820
went long. They had an extended edition. They like it long. That's right. So anyhow, um,

55
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,360
let's start off with some topics tonight. I thought we could talk a little bit about

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,160
some of the stuff we did yesterday on new year's eve. Now we didn't party together sadly.

57
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,640
Um, it just didn't work out that way, but we did spend the day together and one of the

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,520
things we did during new year's eve was we went to the flea market. That was awesome.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,340
Except I didn't buy any fleas. I think I might've caught a couple, but the flea market is basically,

60
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,640
I don't know how to describe it for those that have never been. I imagine everybody's

61
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,660
been to one at some point in their town, but then some people might not live in places

62
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,560
big enough that have them. I don't know, but they're basically like gigantic garage sales.

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,480
Is that an accurate description? Alan? Well, yeah, I guess you could say that a lot of

64
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,520
the wares are new and handmade though. It's not all recycled junk, but I'd like to think

65
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,000
of it as a giant thrift store. Yeah. Yeah. That works. So huge farmer's market, probably

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,520
the biggest farmer's market I've ever seen. Yeah. The one here we have locally in the

67
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,620
Sacramento area is just gigantic. So, um, you know, one of the things that's fun to go shopping

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,120
for is produce and we have a blood oranges. So the other thing that's fun to go shopping

69
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,340
for is like video games cause like there's a lot of people that will bring out their

70
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,160
old shit. And even I saw like arcade machines for sale in some of the, um, junk and some

71
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,360
of the little like, um, side, they have like a side auction. It's weird. So in the side

72
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,840
auction they had, um, it's technically a different one. It's auction town. Yeah. So it's not

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,840
part of deniers where we went. Well, we saw burger time for $950 like a legit arcade cabinet

74
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,700
was in good shape. It was, it was pretty good for its age. Considering that game is from

75
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,800
what 82 maybe it was somewhere around there. 82, 83. Considering that game is like as old

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,840
as it is, that that machine was in beautiful condition. It was $950 and I was like, Alan,

77
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,560
did you see what was on the other side of the machine next to it? No. What was that?

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,440
A berserk in just as good condition. Wow. Like that's the old one with the little bouncing

79
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,840
ball, like the little happy face. Good times. But we did buy video games. At least I know

80
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,200
I bought video games. I bought Sing Star Queen, which I've talked about on the show before

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,080
that I wanted it, but I wasn't going to get it until it went on sale. Well, I guess I

82
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,120
forgot to get it amongst all the other video games that came out last year cause it was

83
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,480
a crazy year and I bought Sing Star Queen for eight bucks at the flea market. That was

84
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,200
awesome. And it was, it was, it was sealed. It might've been like resealed. Sometimes

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,240
the stuff at the flea market, like they've used the little machinery seal it, but it

86
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,920
worked fine. I played it the other day. Uh, and then I bought get this just because I

87
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,400
wanted it and it was in the box of half off stuff. We actually have a super Nintendo hooked

88
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,160
up that works and it's in good condition. I mean, it doesn't look like it's in good

89
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
condition cause the super Nintendo is like Brown, but it works. That's the important

90
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,780
thing. I bought clue for the super Nintendo. Remember the old ass board game. They made

91
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,540
a port of it on super Nintendo that was kind of like, it didn't play exactly like the board

92
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,160
game. Like it kind of put this logic puzzle twist on it where it would tell you like the

93
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,800
lead pipe was in the conservatory and you have to kind of like tie it all together.

94
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,920
So if, if Ms. Peacock was in the conservatory, then she must've had the lead pipe, you know,

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,320
that whole thing. So, um, yeah, good times. So it was cool to play retro games and a favorite

96
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,360
of mine was clue on the super Nintendo for no particular reason. It wasn't really that

97
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,120
great of a game, but it's, you know, one I remember. So dark soccer. What did you, did

98
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,400
you pick up any games? I did. I got one game. I got moral combat, the new one on PS three.

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,800
Nice because Dan was complaining about not having any more PS three games. So, um, I

100
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,960
got the form. We didn't play it yet. I mean, I know later on we're probably going to do

101
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,640
our, how was our gaming week? Of course we always do. Yes. Um, but I picked that up and

102
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:19,080
I got blood oranges and D and um, dried pineapple and you bought a shit ton of tortillas. I

103
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,280
did. And we ate them all last night. Oh my God. That tortilla lady took you to the cleaners.

104
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,360
You bought like two for three. That's not bad. Two bags. And there were six in each.

105
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,720
So what I did, I did what she suggested with the, I got pumpkin tortillas, which were amazing

106
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,160
because pumpkin, everything is awesome. You know, it would be OLR if we didn't have a

107
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,800
food tangent, but I wrapped vanilla ice cream and then rolled them up and put them in the

108
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,580
freezer and chopped and sliced them. Oh my God. That sounds good. They were amazing.

109
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,320
They were gone. They vanished. And then I made, um, uh, black bean and cheddar quesadillas

110
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,780
with and the, the tortillas were black bean and garlic and they vanished like they didn't

111
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,980
last 15 minutes. So I'm just, I've decided we need to make flea market shopping a regular

112
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,720
thing because like we have a super Nintendo and I think, I think Alan has secretly not

113
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,080
so secretly, cause I'm about to share it on the radio, express to me that he would like

114
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,240
to build a collection someday that rivals the vault.

115
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,320
I think you're projecting a little bit, a little bit. Well, the thing is, is that I

116
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,320
had a lot of amazing super Nintendo games with the box and instruction booklet and they

117
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,300
were all in perfect shape cause I treat my stuff very well. I, they've all been sold

118
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,200
on eBay years and years ago for a lot of money and I was kind of reminded actually of the

119
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
price of how some of those games go for at the flea market. Cause there was a, was it,

120
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,400
was it the super nest luffia was like 80 bucks one for that cart. So yeah, there's still

121
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,880
some rare stuff out there. I used to have them, but I got rid of them. So you know,

122
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,880
you guys are welcome to borrow. If you have the wild hair to play anything, you're welcome

123
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,040
to borrow anything. I've got, I think most stuff on the super Nintendo, like I don't

124
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,520
know, like it's, it's really like I'll get a, just an, an urge to just play it. Like,

125
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,680
you know, I don't usually, I'm usually trying to play the new stuff cause you keep on top

126
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,700
of stuff. It's very rare that I'm like, Oh, I just, I want to go play clue on the super

127
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,360
Nintendo like, but when it's right in front of me, I go, I remember how cool this game

128
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,000
was. I needed, I need to just pick this up and take it home cause half off. I paid six

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,440
50 for it, which considering it was still in a box with the manual, I mean it wasn't

130
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,260
new obviously, but they, they shrunk rapid to make it look new, but you know, whatever,

131
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,400
you know, it was a good deal. So I was happy. Well, I've actually, it's funny that you mentioned

132
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,840
that cause I was thinking since Dan and I are a quest to play through every final fantasy

133
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:38,040
game in a row has a died. I was, how many did you get through? Not even one. We were

134
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,000
toward the end of what we just got. Um, when we last played the, everyone got their upgrades.

135
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,360
You got through final fantasy one, two, that's final fantasy half. Anyway, as something about

136
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,160
just starting off with six, sitting down and just jumped to the good stuff, going through

137
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,240
six, although I think four is amazing. So it's like four, don't get me wrong, but six

138
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,840
is one that, you know, we'll, we'll just take turns with because I know that game like the

139
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,260
back of my freaking hand, I've played through that game so many million times or chrono

140
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,480
trigger because then it's just a matter of new game plus. Let me go to our chat room

141
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,240
at chat.orangelaunchradio.com. Interesting kind of discussion going on in the chat room

142
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,680
tonight, kind of about the durability of consoles because I mentioned the super Nintendo and

143
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,480
the fact that, you know, it's still working and that led to some comments in chat room.

144
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,080
Uh, Yuki, I hope I'm saying that right in our chat room, uh, says my super Nintendo's

145
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,280
SNS is plural. Super Nintendo's never die. Those things are pretty durable and I thought

146
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,240
this is interesting. Kai's Judo kind of followed up a little later with the sad thing is 20

147
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,240
years from now, I doubt many people will say they have a PlayStation three or Xbox three

148
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,560
60 that still works. How true. I mean the old systems were quite durable, weren't they?

149
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,760
I mean, and they were all just hard plastic with a little green circuit board in it, right?

150
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,120
Many moving parts. I think Dan said that they had dropped a super Nintendo down two flights

151
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,360
of stairs and it still worked when he was a kid. Those things are rocks. I mean they

152
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,440
were, but yet an Xbox three 60, you're lucky to get one that never red rings. You knock

153
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,160
it over once onto the carpet and it's dead. That's true. They sure don't build them like

154
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,540
they used to, but of course a lot of that could be, to be fair, you know, we did make

155
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,560
a conversion somewhere along the way from CDs or excuse me, from cartridges to CDs,

156
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,920
therefore DVDs, therefore Blu-rays, you know, that was a pretty major shift in, you know,

157
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,880
format. Well, you can even see just in model releases, they go from being super sturdy,

158
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,880
like I have a first model PS3 and it's still in perfect condition. It still plays everything

159
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,220
wonderfully well, but then you get the newer ones, the slims, and they're just, they feel

160
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,800
like nothing. They've got no durability. They're missing options and they cost, you know, when

161
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,920
they were coming out, they were costing as much as the old models did. You know, I found

162
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,240
my Japanese PlayStation 2 the other day and we were cleaning up, setting up for the studio.

163
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,640
I found it and I kind of wanted to hook it up and play some old school BeatMania 2DX,

164
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,880
but the problem is like you, they don't work through component cables. All the styles before

165
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,320
I think 6 don't work through component cables. Like it just, no signal. This is the weirdest

166
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,000
thing. Yeah. Well, and by the way, I have something that I wanted to lend you. My keyboard

167
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,240
mania keyboard so you can do double. Oh, awesome. Cause I do have keyboard mania. I was going

168
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,040
to say if you wanted to hold onto it and do doubles, you're going to have to get out my

169
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,620
PlayStation 2 anyway. So yeah, flea market shopping. That's one of the things, fun things

170
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,840
we did. And I also, I saw in chat, act def says a friend shops on a flea market swap

171
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,840
meets and resells the stuff he finds on eBay for a living. I believe dark soccer was actually

172
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,680
talking to one of her friends there that she used to buy a lot of stuff from who said that

173
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,040
he doesn't have trader Dan trader and he doesn't have a really because he knows that if they

174
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,800
haggle with him, they're just trying to. Yeah. Remarket it on eBay. So that's exactly what

175
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,320
he said. And he's actually said he stopped dealing on eBay and he's doing like on E E

176
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,360
trader or something. Some website. Yeah. I caught that end of the conversation. He seemed

177
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,520
very irritated with eBay and Amazon. I'm not sure what happened there. I mean, Amazon,

178
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:11,360
he used to just completely resell every everything, all the good stuff on, on eBay. Well then

179
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,440
didn't Amazon kick everyone in California out because the whole tax thing, I don't know.

180
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,640
I think they did. I don't think he did Amazon. I think he was strictly eBay and Yahoo. Hmm.

181
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,960
Very interesting. All right. Um, I, I like this comparison. Very interesting comparison.

182
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,680
Then we'll move on with how was your gaming week here in the chat room, uh, from SEP,

183
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,760
win, uh, CEP win in the chat, a chat.org.com says it's like buildings. Do you think the

184
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,760
biggest NFL stadiums will be around a hundred years from now, let alone 2000 as the Roman

185
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:50,280
Colosseum? Well, here's an example. Um, I'm sure I've made no thing. I'm from mobile Alabama.

186
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,060
We have a building that was recently restored that was built in like 1850 something. Um,

187
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:04,640
you know, maybe after the city was like 150 years old and um, it's still in, even when

188
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,880
it was run down, it was still in sturdy condition and lived through years of hurricanes, a hundred

189
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,020
years worth of hurricanes where we had, you know, some of the newer buildings had been

190
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,960
flooded down and were corroded and everything. So just even as an example in a couple hundred

191
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,880
years, you know, construction, we're, we're leaning towards cheaper things that they don't

192
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,160
last. Well, a lot of stuff is built for the environment too. Like here in California,

193
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,000
you don't have brick buildings because of earthquakes. Yeah. So, but, um, in Alabama

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,380
you almost everything is made out of brick and concrete. It's just interesting. And buildings

195
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:46,320
are cheaper there, ironically, even though they'll last through probably more hard weather

196
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,700
than California sees. It's also part of the reason why San Francisco buildings are very

197
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,280
unique and you don't see buildings like it anywhere else is because San Francisco's weather

198
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,220
and layout for a town is really unlike anyone else. Like the Hills in San Francisco are

199
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,840
crazy and just, you know, anyhow, I don't know how we got from video games to that,

200
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,040
but whatever. Well, construction. Yeah. Alan, did you, you didn't end up buying anything

201
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,480
at the flea market, but anything catch your eye that like if you, you know, had the money

202
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,760
burning a hole in your pocket, you wanted a trader. Dan had a lot of, um, big promotional

203
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,840
standee things. Like he had that big Samus super Metroid thing that was like six or seven

204
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,000
feet tall from super Metroid. Oh yeah. You know, I wanted that for the new studio. It's

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,480
probably not for sale cause he has a mounted way up high on the wall. Yeah. But uh, yeah,

206
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,920
I don't know. He'd sell almost anything if you offer him the right amount. So, well no,

207
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,400
cause we've bought some stuff that was just on the collection wall before. So, but that

208
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,600
was back when he had the store in Rio Linda. Well, you know, we put some pictures of the

209
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,740
new studio up at orange launch radio.com. There's a little picture bar towards the top

210
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,600
of the screen and you can kind of see some pictures that we take. I know what the website

211
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,800
says. You can send in your own pictures, but due to some abuse things we had happen a couple

212
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,080
of months ago, we had to pull that. So it's only the hosts really that are adding stuff

213
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,920
to that. And we just added a bunch of pictures from the studio. So there's, you know, you

214
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,280
can see the scrolls and things like that. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. But it was funny

215
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,600
looking at the flea market at the big collections of uh, the game gear and the Atari links at

216
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,940
both the console and the cartridge. How did anyone ever try to market that as portable?

217
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,300
Either system. They were both huge. Well look at an old school Gameboy. Remember the commercial

218
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,320
with the guy sitting on the toilet playing the links? Yeah. And I had a game gear and

219
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,880
I remember it, it went through four double A batteries probably every 72 hours. And it's

220
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,360
like worst battery life than a 3d. It weighs four pounds. Like how is that ever? But yeah,

221
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,700
that was, it was, it was neat seeing all of that really old hardware. Go look at an old

222
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,200
school Gameboy. Like those things are fucking bricks. But I remember you would have the

223
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,520
case for it. Now we put it in a backpack and take it to school and that it was portable.

224
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,280
You know, back then had an inspiration, Rob. What? You know how the people built the house

225
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:58,300
out of Legos? Like an entire house. Yeah. Damn. Well it was, it was a sort of like an

226
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,240
installation art piece, but you can actually pay to stay in it. Um, I want, I just had

227
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,020
a picture of the laptop, by the way. Um, I want to build a house out of Gameboys.

228
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,360
It might be tricky. An entire house. You might be able, you might be able to get a doggy

229
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,400
house. Well, you know, like maybe like a little office or a storage room or something, but

230
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,120
I think that, or even just do a wall, a wall of Gameboys, like modern art piece. Yeah.

231
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,400
Instead of, you know, the eight bit, uh, gaming exhibit that they do, you know, instead of

232
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:40,680
tile, you know, with, uh, the plaster tile plaster, do plaster and Gameboys. All right,

233
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,320
let's move on. We got to talk about our gaming week or two weeks. Uh, it may be, we always

234
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,880
like to, uh, at the top of the show or near it, uh, talk about the video games that we

235
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,300
have been playing this week. Dark Sakura. Uh, how was your gaming week? Wow. Lots of

236
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,920
world of Warcraft. Actually, not a lot because my computer was off for close to a week and

237
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,000
then we just got our cable back. Well, yeah, you had new interwebs for like four days.

238
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,800
I had to come over here on Christmas day. I remember that. To get my damn merry maker

239
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,440
achievement. Open presents under the tree and iron forge. Yes, I remember that because

240
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,960
then we went out, we went, we went out for, you know, nothing's open on Christmas, but

241
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,680
we were able to find that pho was open on Christmas. So I, as, as a proper Jew, I had

242
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Asian food on Christmas day, even if it wasn't Chinese. I remember putting a tweet or something.

243
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,720
I was like two gays and a Jew walk into a pho bar on Christmas. Yeah, it was, it was

244
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,760
delicious. Yeah, it was very good. Delicious. And um, I played, well, once everything got

245
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,600
hooked up, I played a little bit of, um, fractal, which I, I really like that game. Yeah. You

246
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,120
talked about that last week on the show or two weeks. Yeah. Very pretty. And um, we played

247
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,720
rock band of course. Um, like we do every party that we have the quintessential party

248
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,040
game. Yes. And Bradley came over. Oh, Arcadia 42. Yes. We need to get him over here in the

249
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,060
new studio and he, um, brought symbols and then he proceeded to impress, uh, the cousins

250
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:09,640
with his prowess in pro drum mode. Oh, he does the pro drumming. Very cool. And, um,

251
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,540
we had a, well, when I left the house, Dan was watching a play through of Gradius on

252
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:20,360
the, uh, game boy, like the old school Gradius on the game boy. Cause I saw a little Moai

253
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,380
heads. Um, we did, um, I think we did have a little bit of proteus going on in the house.

254
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,120
So that was fun. But mostly it was just putting up games. So I've probably touched, uh, a

255
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,460
couple thousand games this weekend, literally touched them. Right. But as for playing them,

256
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,160
that's a different story. And then there's also the flea market games that you touch.

257
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,680
You put your paws on a lot of those too, digging through that. So yeah, I, I really did try

258
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,640
to, is sad going to trader dance though, because the stuff that he had out, the stuff I would

259
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,680
have wanted was a stuff I already have. So I'm like, well see, that's why I was asking,

260
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,640
you know, who had, um, master system, a master system because we have spare games. We do

261
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,320
literally have spare master system games, which by the way, any of our listeners, if

262
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,920
you have a master system, send me a photo of your master system. And the first person

263
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,320
that sends me a picture of their own personal master system will get a game. Where can they

264
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,560
email that? Cause you don't have an OLR email email bag at orange.radio.com show email.

265
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,720
All right. Mail the mail, the mailbag. And it has to be your master system. Don't Google

266
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,240
the picture. Maybe, maybe they need to put the, you need to tell them to put a little

267
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,280
post it note that says OLR. So we know they didn't like Google it. OLR put it has to have

268
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,760
a post note and, and keep in mind, I'm a designer. I can tell if you photoshopped it or something,

269
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,720
you know, if you don't have posted notes for sake, just scribble it on a notepad or something.

270
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,880
And maybe I'll be kind enough. And if you've got a power base converter, I'll accept that

271
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,040
as well. All right. Anyhow, uh, inadvertent contest here on the show. Uh, Alan, why don't

272
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,920
you go next? No Loki tonight. So it's been several months since I've been on OLR. So

273
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,640
I've actually completed a lot of games. Um, if you remember dragon age origins that came

274
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,040
out in 2009, a couple of months ago, I fired that up and I just couldn't let it go. I,

275
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,040
between that and the expansion awakenings, I completed both of those. Um, I think I've

276
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,640
logged nearly a hundred hours on my Archer ranger rogue that I rolled. I never realized

277
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,440
you finished awakenings. Like I saw that you moved on to dragon age two at one point and

278
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,560
I was like, Oh, maybe he just finally got ADD and he was like, I gotta go play the sequel.

279
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,780
I didn't realize you finished awakening. I used a pretty much with any RPG. Now I use

280
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,400
a FAQ or a walkthrough to play it just because I'm old and lazy and I don't want to miss

281
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,440
things the first way through. There's something secret. So yeah, I used facts. Um, dragon

282
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,200
age oranges was about 70 hours and awakenings was about 24 hours before I beat it. Um, see

283
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,160
I played a little dragon age two, which got derailed by Skyrim cause steam had Skyrim

284
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,320
for 40 bucks for 24 hours during its holiday sale, which for the game that a lot are calling

285
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,980
game of the year that just came out a couple of months ago is a steal. Yeah. So 40 bucks

286
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,960
for Skyrim, which I'm still, is what I'm actively playing. Um, just a PSA, the live listeners,

287
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,200
the Encore sales going on today and that is 40 bucks again. They brought Skyrim back for

288
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,800
40 bucks. That'll be, that'll be it like 10 AM tomorrow. It's gone. If you're listening

289
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,480
to this on the podcast, you probably missed it already. Yeah. Well then the nice thing

290
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,360
about studio six being in my house is that the podcast will be up like 30 minutes after

291
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,280
the show's done. So especially the folks overseas, but I don't think the overseas folks can get

292
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,800
the steam sales. I'm not sure. How does that work? Do you know dark soccer? I really don't

293
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,360
know. I'll have to ask. I'm curious if the folks, do we have any chatter? I'm going to

294
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,000
have to go home now and check my steam. I can't do it during the show unless there's

295
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,300
steam for Linux now. I don't know. Uh, I'm here. Yeah. Did the folks in chat know is

296
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:53,040
do we have any, I see Aki ripper in chat. I get ripper. Can you steam Sweden close enough?

297
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,860
You might be able to log into the steam website and buy something on the website on your account

298
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,040
and then it'll download to the client. Just wait till you get home until 10 AM tomorrow.

299
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,480
But um, yeah, so I'm kind of juggling dragon H two and Skyrim right now and those are both

300
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,080
pretty meaty meals of a game. So I don't know how long I'm going to be able to juggle those

301
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,160
two. I got a DSI XL for Christmas for my lovely, kind, generous boyfriend and studio. Um, and

302
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,820
because of my DSI XL, I've been playing warrior where touched. Can we back up a minute? Because

303
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,480
this certainly caught me off guard. Cause I asked you, I said, what do you want for

304
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,520
Christmas? And you said you wanted a DSI XL. I'm like, you, you, you want that even though

305
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,240
it costs as much as a three ds. So just for the, for the listeners that might be asking

306
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,280
the same question, why an XL? Why now? You got to answer, well, you have a three ds and

307
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:48,360
I can play yours when you're at work. Honest answer. Um, that, and I have a thing, I almost

308
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,040
have a thing against Nintendo, but the first generation of their little hardware portables,

309
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,200
I thought the ds original, the ds fat was ugly and it looked cheap. And the ds light

310
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,320
was like, Oh, okay, this looks like a good device. That's when I finally got on board

311
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:09,260
with the ds was with the light. I just think with the weird analog stick on the right side

312
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:15,680
attachment that came out for the three ds, um, I'm just, I want the second generation.

313
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,360
And when I play Mario Kart seven on your three ds, I can only do two races before my right

314
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,740
hand is completely cramped. Cause I have a big giant spindly spidery man hands and it

315
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,920
hurts to play. So I have my giant ds XL and I've got a ton of ds games, RPGs that I haven't

316
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,320
played. So all right. Fair enough. Yeah. And now when you explain it to me, it made a lot

317
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,960
of sense. I was all right. And plus now, now that I've really got my pause on one of those,

318
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,760
it's a really nice device. It's a nice device. It's kind of a bummer. It was so late in the

319
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,200
life and now a lot of folks have moved on cause you know, it's a pretty rock solid ds.

320
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,800
I just want to take a step back for just a minute and a chat. Hers have clarified act

321
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:00,560
deft from Mexico steam sales work worldwide. There you go. So, um, so aside from Mario

322
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:07,560
are touched on the XL, I also did my sort of annual play through of half life and half

323
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,040
life to episodes one and two. I beat those from start to finish. This is, that's kind

324
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,880
of like your version of dark soccer is Christmas nights. I notice once or twice a year I just

325
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,880
get half life fever and I got to play through it. I just need to do half life to like that.

326
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,880
The proper half life too. I haven't done that yet. And some chatters and a chat might be

327
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
thinking about a story that happened in gaming news this week. And yes, we'll be talking

328
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,840
about that later. So bastions five bucks. That's a good game. Very good game. Lot of

329
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,420
a game of the year list. Speaking of game of the year list, I do want to get this out

330
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,740
at some point. Um, I know it's 2012 but since we didn't have a show last week and the way

331
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,600
timing worked out, we need to have a proper like end of the year kind of recap. So we

332
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,200
will be talking about our games of the year. Dark soccer myself and Alan have picked our

333
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,520
top three games of the year. We'll get Loki's next week guys. Don't worry when he's back.

334
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,000
Uh, but we want to hear your guys's game of the year picks too. So we have some posts

335
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,880
on Facebook and Google plus. So if you haven't chimed in yet, go do that. Cause we're going

336
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,160
to do that in part B and some of our picks might surprise you. So I know that there are

337
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,720
probably what, three games that everybody's picking. Well, we'll see. Maybe our lists

338
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,720
are the same three, maybe not, but I want to emphasize there's no right or wrong answers.

339
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,400
And I got to say, just looking at Facebook and Google plus, I'm really impressed at the

340
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,520
diversity of choices. I really truly don't think that just because every media outlet

341
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,040
says game A, B or C is the game of the year means everybody else is on board. Like I don't

342
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,000
think any two people have picked the same game. Very interesting. So anyway, sorry about

343
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,160
that. Uh, where were we? Your gaming week, Alan? I really think that that's it. I, uh,

344
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,360
as far as this week, I've scrambled around on the steam contest for the holiday sale

345
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:52,240
where you unlock Steve achievements to earn coupons. Um, also I have two coupons for 50

346
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,320
percent off any valve game. Good through, I think the first of March if an all our listener

347
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,520
wants to add me on steam, I'll trade them that coupon. We should have an OLR group on

348
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,280
steam that they could find you on. So I played psycho knots for about an hour and a half

349
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,000
to be able to use my mind power that, um, pyromania to burn two squirrels because there

350
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,040
was an achievement for cooking two critters. So I played some games like super meat boy

351
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,960
has one yesterday that I need to go through. So that's all I know you're doing that too.

352
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,140
So if you want to find us on steam or any of that stuff, um, this, it's awesome on orange

353
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,240
launch radio.com and the upper right hand corner is this little box that says extended

354
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,480
play and you'll see all the logos for like all the community social networking websites

355
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,960
and you'll see the steam logo on there and you can join the OLR clan and you can say

356
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,240
hi to Alan or salacious pop and he'll give you treats. It sounds like maybe, maybe he

357
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,600
may not have enough for everybody. Um, my gaming week, um, I've played a lot of hodgepodge

358
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,440
kind of stuff. Like I mentioned before, I bought seeing star queen clue, but there's

359
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,200
probably two games primarily I've been playing. Um, you know, kind of focusing on the past

360
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,360
couple of weeks. Uh, first one I'll mention is on the three DS, um, a port of one of my

361
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,560
favorite games that I played for the first time last year, even though the game is actually

362
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:13,000
a couple of years old itself. Uh, VVVVVV came out for the three DS it's on the three

363
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,360
DS shop. I mean literally like just last week. Uh, and you know, it's, it's a very faithful

364
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,660
port of the version that's on the PC. You don't have the level editor, although they're

365
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,000
saying that that may be coming in the future, but you do have some like best of user created

366
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,680
levels, which is pretty cool. And of course the games in three D a little bit. I mean,

367
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,260
it's not complicated three D it's kind of like the NES classics. It's like, like three

368
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:45,260
different layers of three D kind of see things on. Um, but the game itself, VVVVV is a great

369
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,120
game and excellent game. Some folks may find it to be a little bit short, but I think it's

370
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,560
well worth it for the $8 kick ass soundtrack. It's kind of very similar to super Metroid,

371
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,840
very easy gimmick, uh, the whole gravity flipping thing, but it works so well. I mean, it's

372
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,880
a, it's a great game. It's, it's great. And of course as somebody who loved Commodore

373
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,960
64 and really grew up on Commodore 64, I love that the game has a lot of, you know, kind

374
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,560
of tips of the hat to the Commodore 64 days, including the loading screen. So I thought,

375
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,960
I think the three DS version is a worthy port. I realize some people may have a hard time

376
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,200
justifying, well, I just bought VVVV as part of the humble indie bundle that was just out

377
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,660
because it was one of the games from the third that came back and I paid five bucks for likes,

378
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:36,620
you know, 15 games that included VVVV. Why would I go pay $7 in the three DS shop now?

379
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,120
That's a damn good question. Maybe it's not worth it in that regard. But for me, I love

380
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,480
the idea of having a portable version. You know, sometimes you just want games to be

381
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,920
able to have wherever you are, airport, you know, commuting or whatever it is that you're

382
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,640
doing, you know, out and about, it's sometimes nice to have some games to go and VVVV is

383
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,440
a worthy addition to the three DS lineup. Um, let's see. Otherwise, the other game that

384
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,440
I spent a huge chunk of time playing is Star Wars, the Old Republic, the new MMO, uh, that's

385
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,560
out from BioWare and EA. I did pick this up, uh, the 21st, the day after it was out. And

386
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,620
I've spent a good part of the past couple weeks playing it. I have like four characters

387
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,440
in the level 10-ish range, two of them Imperial and two of them Empire. So I've gotten a good

388
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,160
feel, especially for the introduction parts of the game. Um, this, God, where do I even

389
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,840
begin with this? A lot of people are comparing it to WoW. And I got to say this comment first.

390
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,800
I, I'm really amazed with how pressed some of the Star Wars players are when it comes

391
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,640
to WoW because the general chat half the time is nothing but talk about, oh, this game is

392
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,200
so much better than WoW. And, oh, this game, oh, this game just kicks WoW's ass. And, oh,

393
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,680
WoW is a kiddie game. And you know, they're just bringing pandas cause it's a kiddie game.

394
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,160
I used to play WoW, but it sucks now. And it's like, wow, you guys hate WoW so much.

395
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,800
You can't stop talking about it. But that's not really a slam on Star Wars. That's just

396
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,400
a slam on the chat community. I was comparing it to Star Trek Online. Let, well, here's

397
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,080
my point. Let both games just be, because does Star Wars have a lot of inspiration from

398
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,400
WoW? Sure. One of the classes I was playing, I was laughing cause I'm like, this place

399
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,620
is just like a warrior. It even has a talent called Sunder and you build up rage. I'm like,

400
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:35,540
this is like, just like a WoW warrior. But at the same time, the questing in Star Wars,

401
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,860
The Old Republic, is so immersive. Like, you know, the voice acting really adds a neat

402
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,200
element to it. Of course, the whole Bioware touch of the conversation trees, the fact

403
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,680
that you can have your character be light side or dark side, even within the Empire

404
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,480
or Imperial. Like, you can be a bad Jedi or you can be a good Sith. It's really funky

405
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,840
how that works, but I like that. And the group conversation is really interesting too. I've

406
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,080
been playing the game a lot with Shane. And, like, we will both kind of go out and quest

407
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,960
together and he likes to have his person be good and I like to have mine be bad. So, it's

408
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,360
kind of funny watching that struggle and you get to see kind of different outcomes and

409
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,000
all that. So, it's neat. I wanted to finish my thought really, really quick though on

410
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,080
the whole, like, pressed Star Wars people and WoW. WoW obviously got its inspiration

411
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,960
from other games too and that's important to say. Like, I think Star Wars is just this

412
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,520
company's evolution of the MMO genre. And the question is, does it work? And my answer

413
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:43,840
is, in most places yes, but in a few places no. And I think any MMO is going to have this

414
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,000
problem when it first comes out and that's kind of about finding the balance. And I think

415
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,520
that's where the game has its trickiest part right now is balance and a lot of that has

416
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,300
to do with the economy. The economy is really clouded, uncertain right now and it's really

417
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,920
hard to make money and they just nerfed one of the big professions for that and so a lot

418
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,400
of that needs some fine tuning. But, you know, the game's only been out two weeks. For an

419
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,800
MMO that's hardly anything, I'm sure a lot of that will be fixed in time. But the other

420
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,440
thing I've got to knock Star Wars for because this is something I keep saying, like, every

421
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,480
time I'm playing the game, damn, I wish they would fix this. One of the reasons I love

422
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,040
WoW is the community and the UIs that they've built and Star Wars desperately needs to open

423
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,120
it up and let users make their own UIs and interfaces and add-ons, especially for things

424
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,600
like the auction house, especially for things like targeting and things of that sort. Because

425
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,860
if you have two people and their companions out, healing is kind of a pain in the butt.

426
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:46,560
So I'd like to see some UI changes for that and just some of the ways things are set up

427
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,000
are a little weird and I just think the community could improve on that a little bit. But, it's,

428
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,320
I mean, especially compared to, I played Riff when it first came out. I played Warhammer

429
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,600
when it first came out. I played, you know, I've played a lot of the Ion. I played Ion

430
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,320
when it first came out. I played a lot of the other ones. And this is really the first

431
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,660
one where I was like, wow, this really is something different. This is a neat experience.

432
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,720
This, you know, I like the story, which is weird because I'm not even that big on the

433
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,320
Star Wars movies. Like, you know, I appreciate them. I understand why there's fandom for

434
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,240
the old movies from the 70s at least, not the new ones. But, you know, I get, you know,

435
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520
I get why Star Wars is popular, but I found myself really getting kind of sucked into

436
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,000
the story and it's really interesting. And I really liked getting to kind of, you know,

437
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,160
play this character that could be light or dark or neutral or what have you. So the biggest

438
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,960
strengths are in the fact that every single player game element is great. And you could

439
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,840
go from 0 to 50 single player, no problem. I think it really helps when MMOs have the

440
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,080
mythology pre-built to then bring in. Because Lord of the Rings Online, obviously, Lord

441
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:06,740
of the Rings is, you know, significantly huge. You know, it's been around for 50, 60 years.

442
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,440
Star Wars Galaxies, I guess, was a bad game, but that also had the Star Wars mythos to

443
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,600
bring with it. Well, hold on. World of Warcraft had WoW or Warcraft Orcs vs. Humans 1, 2,

444
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,280
and 3 and Blizzard put in a shitload of lore. I was going to say quickly, Star Wars Galaxies

445
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,540
wasn't necessarily a bad game. It was a game that made bad decisions. Well, yeah, because

446
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,600
they, yeah, they switched it up to make more, make it more accessible in all the diehard

447
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,880
people. Right. Don't alienate your primary fan base. It's something, it's where, that's

448
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,300
where WoW is that a, because for some people, Cataclysm was the equivalent of the NXC. And,

449
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,360
you know, so anyway, or New User, what did they call it? New User Experience, whatever

450
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,920
it was called. Anyway. But because Bioware doesn't as of yet have a good MMO pedigree,

451
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,240
they do have a great game pedigree. I mean, it's Bioware, so I didn't really have any

452
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:04,440
doubt in my mind that the Old Republic was going to be bad as just a campaign experience.

453
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,480
But a lot of people are wondering when, once you get to level 50, are there, I mean, are

454
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,320
there raids? Like what do you do once you're at max level? Apparently there are, there

455
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,840
are operations, I think they're called, which are the equivalent of raids, I believe. And

456
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,020
there's PVP. You can do PVP at level 10 and all that. But that's a good question. I'm

457
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,440
not really sure. I'm sitting here as somebody who's been playing the game for two weeks

458
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,480
and I'm not really sure. Because with Rift, Rift was a completely new property. They had

459
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,920
to do all that world building about the conflict and there's this race and this race and blah,

460
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,200
blah, blah and why these big portals are opening up in the sky. All the time. All the time,

461
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,360
which is a different problem altogether. And it was just hard to really invest myself in

462
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:50,720
the world that I was playing in. Whereas with Star Wars and WoW, you have the mythology

463
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,960
going back years and years that players already will play that. That's what brings people

464
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,220
to those games, I think. So to try to kind of try and wrap up, because I know I'm rambling

465
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,220
here a bit, but to kind of wrap up my thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic, I think it's

466
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,280
a good game. And if you're into MMOs, you'll probably want to pounce on this pretty quick

467
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,640
because, you know, a lot of people have been. But if you're not sure, I say wait. Because

468
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,840
I think the game's only going to get better with a little more maturity and age. And I

469
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,240
think in six months to a year when they really have a lot of players in end game and they

470
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,320
have a lot of this ironed out, I think the game's going to be very, very neat. Is it

471
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,560
a WoW killer? I don't know. I don't really like that term. Because I don't think, like

472
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,200
there's similar games out there all the time. You know, Burnout didn't kill Need for Speed

473
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,840
and you know, Call of Duty and Battlefield can compete. You know, it's just different.

474
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,480
And it's expensive if you want to play both games. That's the only bummer. But the games

475
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,000
can coexist. I don't think one necessarily has to cannibalize the other. I think there's

476
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,240
going to always be people that want to play WoW. And there's going to be people that don't

477
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,480
want to play WoW that want to play Star Wars. And you know, there's going to be people like

478
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,520
me that kind of want to play a little bit of both. So, there you go. Alan, I do want

479
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,820
to quickly ask you though, because you play a lot of MMOs. You've come on the other show

480
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:12,180
Horde House a lot to talk about WoW. You play a lot of WoW. You raid in WoW. You're an end

481
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,480
game raider. You're one of the tops of the server. But you don't seem to have that same

482
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,080
interest in Star Wars. Is that because of your investment in WoW? Is it a money thing?

483
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:29,880
Is it just being a hater? What is it? Well, I've dedicated myself to raiding with people

484
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:38,080
12 hours a week, which is a lot. And I am comfortable with that arrangement for right

485
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,760
now. Once I get a job, I will probably have to quit doing that. But it's a financial thing.

486
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:51,280
I've already staked my claim with my raiding guild in WoW. And yeah, I don't want to pay

487
00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:01,120
15 bucks a month twice for that. I'm also on the year-long Diablo III Death Pact. So,

488
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,400
I've pretty much said, yes WoW, regardless of how bad you get or how lame your patches

489
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,000
are, I'm going to be sticking with you for a year. And I'm committed to that. I don't

490
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,480
really need Wandering Eyes for MMOs. Though I will say though, the reason why I decided

491
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,040
to start playing Dragon Age Origins until I beat it was the fact that aside from raiding,

492
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,140
I am kind of burned out on WoW. So that's helping my console gaming more. I've actually

493
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,440
been more into WoW than I have been in a WoW, which is really weird. I don't know if that's

494
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,260
just because I've had a lot of time off work, so I've had more time to play things. Or the

495
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:44,120
fact that I am loving Arcane Mage right now in Warcraft. But yeah, I'll play WoW for a

496
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,420
couple hours. I'll play Star Wars for a couple hours. Then I go back to playing WoW. That's

497
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,480
been a lot of my vacation when I'm not doing other more productive things. A lot of chatters

498
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,000
talking about Guild Wars 2. Kaijuto, I think, kicked it off. I cannot wait for Guild Wars

499
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,640
2. That's going to be my main MMO. And yeah, I gotta say, I'm really interested in Guild

500
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,980
Wars 2 as well. I'm hoping the payment model is the same as Guild Wars 1 where it's buy

501
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,000
the game and never pay money again. Would be great. Not have to pay a monthly fee or

502
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,880
whatever. Yeah, I'm looking forward to Guild Wars 2. That'll be another MMO I'm going to

503
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,400
have to somehow juggle. So we'll see. I kind of think in the long run, I may keep... It's

504
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,040
hard to say. I've been off work this whole time, so I've been able to juggle two MMOs.

505
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,880
But when I go back to work, I'm probably going to have to pick one or the other. And I've

506
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,080
agreed to play WoW for a year. I'm on the same thing where I've already signed the death

507
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,440
pact. I want to be, but I'm not. But I think even if I had to choose between the two, I

508
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,840
would choose WoW at this point. Because I think Star Wars will get better with age.

509
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,720
I didn't start... Think about it. I didn't start playing WoW until Burning Crusade expansion

510
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,800
came out. I started WoW with vanilla. And hated it. And hated it. And then I played

511
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,920
Burning Crusade and hated it. And then I didn't even bother with any of the other stuff because

512
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,900
I still hated it. And then Cataclysm came out and I was like, I kind of like this.

513
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:16,620
So does me saying, I don't want to maybe play Star Wars right now a bad thing? Not necessarily.

514
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,000
I mean, God, look at my WoW addiction. And that just took a couple years to grow. So

515
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,900
I think, I think, I think Star Wars will still be here in a year or two, unlike some of these

516
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,920
other MMOs that have come out. Like, is anyone still playing Age of Conan? Anybody?

517
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,560
It's not on the show role because I think it would have been for last week, but we didn't

518
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:41,360
do a Christmas show. Didn't Swotar or the Old Republic hit a million paid subscribers

519
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,840
the fastest out of even faster than WoW? Wasn't that a story? We're not covering it tonight,

520
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,080
but they put out a press release saying that they have a million.

521
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,000
I think they've sold like 1.5 million copies of the game globally. So that wouldn't surprise

522
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,200
me at all. They have that many.

523
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,080
Yeah. There's still two more, one or two more weeks before people start getting rebills.

524
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,640
So the rebuilds is when they're going to be able to say that they have subscribers.

525
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Exactly.

526
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,200
So we'll see. We'll see. All right. Um, there is stuff going on besides MMOs in the world.

527
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,600
Quickly, some housekeeping and then we'll get into some news. Uh, I already mentioned

528
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,580
the game of the year. We're going to talk about in part B, so stay tuned. Get your picks

529
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,400
in at our Facebook or at our Google Plus page. And if you don't have us added on either of

530
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,440
those pages, maybe you should take care of that. Um, also I want to plug some other things

531
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,920
going on elsewhere. One of them that I really, really need to plug and make sure you guys

532
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,080
know about is something called the big battle. And this is something that Derek from dead

533
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,720
pixel live, which is another show on the all games network is kind of spearheading, but

534
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,120
it's a lot of, uh, community shows kind of all pitching in to try and make this thing

535
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,160
a success and get more people at the table wanting to kick each other's ass in a good

536
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,880
way though, because it's all about fighting games. Uh, the big battle this time is I think

537
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,640
the big beat down. Uh, and it's all fighting games. It's mortal combat, it's street fighter,

538
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,480
arcade edition, it's street fighter three, it's ultimate mortal combat three. It's all

539
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,200
these fighting games. Um, and we're trying to get as many people in to participate in

540
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:13,660
the tournament to find out which show has the best fighting game fans. Um, so far I'm

541
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,680
the only one signed up from OLR. So I'm hoping some of you will head on over to the big battle

542
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,040
dot net and change that sign up over there on the beat down board, uh, for one of the

543
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,120
games. Now the only kind of for some people deal breaker for some people is that it's

544
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,840
all xbox 360. So some of you have these on PS3. See, I have mortal combat and super street

545
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,200
fighter four on our PS3, so I couldn't sign up for those games. But yes, you can. What

546
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,280
do you mean you can come to my house? I guess I could, huh? Yes, you can. What does that

547
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,600
mean you're going to sign up to? Maybe I will. Ooh. Ooh. Well, there you go. Keep in mind,

548
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,440
this is gimpy hand lady. You know, if you have an arcade stick that you could use, right?

549
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,280
We have several arcade sticks. That won't be a problem. All right, so maybe, maybe we'll

550
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,640
work something out. But anyway, it's all an xbox 360. So super street fighter for arcade

551
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,780
edition, mortal combat, street fighter three, third strike online, ultimate mortal combat

552
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,840
three. Go sign up on the beat down board at the big battle dot net and say you're going

553
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,200
to represent the OL army or team OLR. Uh, they'll know what you're talking about. Go

554
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,320
sign up and uh, I'll kick your ass soon if you're playing ultimate mortal combat three

555
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,540
because that's the one of the games that I do own on the xbox 360, which I find funny

556
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,520
because you can't buy that game anymore. Yet that's the game that has the most signups

557
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,440
right now. I think people just love the classics. What else can you say? So go sign up. All

558
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,440
right. Um, other thing I got to plug here, the geek dash life awards. Um, you know, we've

559
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,640
talked about this website before and part of it is because you know, dark soccer is

560
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,700
like a rights for it. You still write for it? Yes, I do. It's just with the last semester

561
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:52,600
I slacked off on my writing. You know how busy I was. Well, the editors over there,

562
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,480
which I don't believe was stark Sakura cause I think there's gotta be rules against that.

563
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,440
But uh, the editors over there did nominate us as one of the best podcasts of the years

564
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,760
and the second annual geek life awards. Woo hoo. Um, but the funny thing is, um, another

565
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,360
podcast that was nominated was hoard house, my show about Warcraft right now in the poll

566
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,480
hoard house is beating orange launch radio for best podcast of the year. I'm sure extra

567
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,880
prayer had nothing to do at all with that, but if you want to go vote for hoard house

568
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,600
or you want to go vote for orange lounge radio, I'm going to post that website in chat right

569
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,140
now and you should go vote. Um, of course there are some other good shows nominated.

570
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,720
I'm not going to dog the competition. Maybe you want to go vote for cheap ass gamer, fear

571
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,160
the boot or battleship pretension, which are also nominated and find shows in their own

572
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,760
right. So you know what, if you really think they are the best show of the year, then go

573
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,880
vote for them. That's fine. Um, geek dash life. We just want to thank them. It's an

574
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,680
honor to be nominated, right? Dark Sakura. God, what are you going to do if you lose

575
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:56,480
to ex defer? I don't know. I guess talk about his bleached asshole. All right. Good answer.

576
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,140
All right. Speaking of hoard house, I should mention we haven't done a show for like two

577
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:07,800
weeks over there. Correlation bleacher asshole win an award. Do you want to find out? No.

578
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,800
Okay. Anyway, um, uh, I should say a hoard house hasn't had a show for like two weeks

579
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,800
and probably won't be back till next week. And that's just a timing thing on X for a

580
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,960
nice part. Like I'm going to be gone for four days next week. So yep. Good times. Busy,

581
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,120
busy, but Hey, it's the holidays so we can kind of get away with it. All right. Let's

582
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,680
talk about gaming news. Let's get back into what is going on in the gaming industry this

583
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,440
week. Not a lot come to find out, but there are some things going on. We do want to bring

584
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,920
to the table and talk about with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

585
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:44,020
Alan, start us off tonight. So Nintendo, they've been razzed on so hard, especially by the

586
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,880
gentlemen that I am subbing for tonight. Um, as far as their inability to embrace stuff

587
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:56,280
that other consoles are doing, particularly online supply, uh, online play, but they are

588
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:02,680
jumping on one bandwagon finally, and that is paid DLC. Um, is it true that the Wii didn't,

589
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,160
you couldn't patch games on the Wii, right? There were no, you cannot patch games on the

590
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,200
Wii. Um, and the proof of this would be what's going on with Skyward Sword. They actually

591
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,400
had to release this whole channel and it's there in the Wii shop. If you go look, one

592
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,880
of the games I forgot to mention, I played this week, I found I had extra points in my

593
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,200
Wii balance or Wii accounts. I went and bought blaster master for the NES on virtual console.

594
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,120
Woo. But as I was looking for the shop, I saw the fix your game file channel for Skyward

595
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,760
Sword and I was like, that has to be embarrassing. But yeah, they can't, they can't just patch

596
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,400
Skyward Sword to do it. They have to have a fix my game channel. So even with their

597
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,440
most, uh, up until the 3DS, they supplemental content, whether it be, um, to enhance the

598
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,200
product or to correct the product, they just never did it. Well, um, Nintendo with the

599
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,360
3DS are finally doing paid DLC and the first title that is going to get it is their new,

600
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,600
uh, Fire Emblem franchise. I know Fire Emblem has had some characters in Smash Brothers

601
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:03,600
for a while. It's not really that big of a franchise here, but I know a lot of the diehard

602
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,960
Nintendo fans know about Fire Emblem and it's going to cost several hundred yen. It's kind

603
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,440
of vague right now when it comes out. But yeah, you can expect, uh, you know, with the,

604
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,000
uh, online store that 3DS has where you can buy the old, you know, Game Boy Advance and,

605
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:26,440
um, the little, uh, the DSware games. Now when you buy a actual retail cart product,

606
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,760
you can eventually log in maybe either through the game or through your 3DS and buy bonus

607
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,640
campaigns for it, which is just money, money, money. I mean, look at Microsoft and Sony

608
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,300
and all the millions they've made with pay to unlock launch day DLC that's on the disc.

609
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:49,120
I should say this though. The Wii does have, the Wii does have kind of download content.

610
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:55,600
Um, like Rockband has it. One of the games, Final Fantasy IV, the after years, you could

611
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,240
download the extra chapters for a couple hundred Wii points each. So, I mean, Nintendo's done

612
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:08,240
DLC a little bit, but not a lot of bit. And I want to say everything that was DLC on the

613
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,360
Wii, I'm thinking, Chatter might correct me on this, but I want to say none of it was

614
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,120
Nintendo themselves. All of it was third party companies that were doing it because, you

615
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,320
know, Final Fantasy Square Enix, uh, Rockband is, you know, harmonics. So I don't think

616
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,000
any of it is coming from Nintendo themselves. So that's what makes us notable both that

617
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,720
A, it's the 3DS, which, you know, we haven't seen DLC on the 3DS yet. We've seen, you know,

618
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,240
buy the game, right? I just pimped VVVV, uh, but we haven't seen DLC and it's Nintendo

619
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:42,920
themselves now. That's a big deal. Yeah. So, so I stand corrected. Yeah. We did have the

620
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:49,800
facilities for DLC, but this one, um, you know, for a handheld definitely is interesting.

621
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,000
And the Wii U, they've also confirmed that it's going to have paid DLC, but there's still

622
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,120
a lot more we need to find out about the Wii U than just that. Um, some comments from our

623
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,660
chat room at chat.orangewonstrategy.com. Yuki says, and here I was respecting Nintendo for

624
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:10,280
not doing DLC till now. Tigerclaws theorizing, who knows, maybe a new Zelda quest via DLC.

625
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:17,160
Kaijuto just says, yeah, the DLC sounds lame. So maybe this begs the question, is this good

626
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:25,120
news or is this bad news? I think it's really all about in what is it that they're offering?

627
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,240
I mean, none of us here on the show, and I think in chat really appreciate that pay to

628
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,880
unlock content that feels like a slap in the face, you know, the, uh, content that's already

629
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,720
on the disc that you have to pay money to get like the, you know, the Katamari levels

630
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,080
were there. Some fighting games have characters that are already on the disc. You have to

631
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:48,160
pay to unlock and so on. But when you are truly downloading expansions that enhance

632
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,960
like, you know, what Dragon Age Awakenings in some ways. The Fable ones. Like extra quote.

633
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,400
Well, yes and no. Like some of the DLC I don't think is very good with Fable. But I'm saying

634
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:07,280
I'm using it as a type. Sure. Sure. Well, Awakenings is closer to the, to the model

635
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,120
that PC games used in the 80s and 90s and that it was a proper expansion that was a

636
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,680
good 20 or 30 hours of game, which is about how long I spent on it. With Dragon Age Origins

637
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,440
before I played Awakenings, I did go onto the BioWare store and buy some of their DLC.

638
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,120
And those were only like two or three hours long for five bucks, but I was still, it was

639
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,440
well done. So they're not all terrible. Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, my brother was commenting

640
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,000
to me about Nintendo not doing DLC. He said Nintendo should have made new tracks for Mario

641
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,280
Kart. And yeah, I'm kind of like, I would like to see Mario Kart seven, get more tracks,

642
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,360
download content, you know, as long as they don't go down that path that, you know, we

643
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,640
talked about Ridge Racer on the Vita a couple of weeks ago on the show, like it sounds like

644
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,760
they're doing a horrible thing, but like every Mario Kart game ever has had 32 tracks except

645
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,680
I think the Game Boy one, you could unlock all of the tracks in the original in, which

646
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,560
was a hell of a deal. You know what I mean? But most Mario, you know, you buy a Mario

647
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,720
Kart game, you know, you're going to get eight cups, four of them retro, four of them new

648
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,560
for, you know, it's, it's like the same formula every time, but I think it'd be pretty rad

649
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,080
if some more of the retro levels came back as DLC, you know, I would, I would support

650
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,160
that as long as it was reasonably priced, you know, there's gotta be a limit to it,

651
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,660
but it would be interesting. But I think there's a lot of ways that Nintendo could do this

652
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:31,160
very wrong too. And of course pay to unlock content is the wrong way to do it or stuff

653
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,560
that doesn't enhance stuff that's required for the core gaming experience would be bad.

654
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:43,000
Well, going down the same path, I got a story here about what's happening at the Wii U.

655
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,200
The Wii U obviously not going to be out for a while, but some rumors out there that Nintendo

656
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,960
is going to be doing a full blown app store for the system. So think like, you know, what

657
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,640
iTunes has going on. Right now, you know, they've got the eShop, they've got little

658
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,480
stores, but the Wii U supposedly is going to go one step further. There's going to be

659
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:10,200
a wide variety of apps. It will be stuff that will operate on the Wii U itself like TV things

660
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,080
like you see on Xbox 360, Major League Baseball, but some things that will run independently

661
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,560
on the controller because the tablet obviously is its own little screen or what have you.

662
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,000
Now the only thing that confuses me about that is I thought that controller doesn't

663
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,760
have its own processor in it. Like I thought all that did was stream video that's basically

664
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,280
being processed by your Wii U. It was just like a terminal, just like an output. Yeah,

665
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,400
it's like that on live in your own house. Best way to describe it, you know, that's

666
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,800
how it's working. So my thought is, well, are you really downloading apps to your controller

667
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,080
then or are you downloading apps that just play on your controller but you can't really

668
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,280
take them portable? Unless something drastic has changed with the specs of the system,

669
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,520
maybe they are giving that thing a little processor, I don't know. I would think they're

670
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,040
not because they want to keep the cost down, but it would be interesting if that's happening.

671
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,480
But they are talking about, you know, check your email, browse the web, do Facebook and

672
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,560
maybe some little games too on that little device. I could see where, you know, you have

673
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,480
the controller in your bedroom and it's streaming from the device in the living room and you

674
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,420
can kind of like surf the web from bed and all that, but I don't know, most people have

675
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:23,440
iPhones, iPads, Kindles, you know, other devices for that. Yeah. So I don't know if we use

676
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:31,640
necessary, but I don't know, what do you guys think? I can see the advantage, especially

677
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:38,200
if you just want one thing to give you all the convenience. So maybe that's a good thing.

678
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:44,800
And honestly, it makes me think of that, what's that laptop that my husband wants, the transformer

679
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,900
where you pull off the top and as a tablet, I think it might be something to that extent.

680
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:57,360
So like, say that you're, here's a, just a very domestic example, but you know, say that

681
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,940
your Wii is your way of surfing the web, you know, and you like are looking for a cake

682
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,440
recipe, put the cake recipe on your little tablet, take it to the kitchen and go make

683
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,540
your cake. I mean, I'm just using that as an example. That would work. I could see that

684
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:18,240
in a little Nintendo promo they do, you know, because there, there are marketing it to more

685
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:25,920
of a home family type of thing. So that way you've got more uses out of it. Something

686
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:32,560
that is on that family oriented domestic level. So I don't know why the chatters are doing

687
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,600
this, but they're putting app in the names of all these Nintendo franchises like app

688
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:43,760
zero, the app of Zelda app, Icarus excite app. But that, I mean, one of the ones that was suggested

689
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,240
by GOV day was app crossing. And that made me think, Oh God, there's where DLC could

690
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,520
go really wrong is animal crossing. Oh man. I mean, it could be really good, but I just

691
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,880
see, Oh, I could just see the easy cash in on animal crossing. You know what though for

692
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:05,040
Wii U imagine animal crossing with Wii U you can go to the island again. Maybe, who knows?

693
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,880
I just would like to see them do something really different with animal crossing. You

694
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,080
know, they've got the basics. We've seen the same game four times now. I'll be nice to

695
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:20,400
see something different. Tom Nook is a real estate agent. Great. Tom Nook can foreclose

696
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:28,600
on me. Can't wait. All right. Anyhow, he is the 1%. All right. Dark soccer. What do you

697
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:34,600
have for us news wise? I have a little something actually it's a cease and desist that my

698
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:42,040
apologies. It's that's later story. It's cease and desist that story right now. Yes, I will.

699
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:48,880
All right. It's the UK prices. Well, actually the European union prices for the Vita and

700
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:55,280
the memory cards and stuff. So, um, here's some of the game prices. Um, uncharted golden

701
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:07,320
abyss will be 49.99 euro or 44.99 pound. Bond nation racer will be 39.99 or 34.99 respectively.

702
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:14,240
Everybody's golf the same wipeout 2048 the same unit 13 also the same little deviance

703
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,440
will be 29.99 euro and 24.99 pound. And then, um, reality fighters is the same price as

704
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,240
well. So as far as the, um, different bits that go with it, the four gig memory card

705
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:33,680
will be 19.99, 17.99 pound. Um, eight gig will be 34.99 or 31.99 and the 16 gig will

706
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:44,560
be 49.99 and 44.99. Uh, lots of other stuff too. Like the chargers 49.99 slash 44.99.

707
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,320
All these different man, England. Why do you have to stick with the pounds? Why can't you

708
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,440
know? I should probably kind of a decent thing that they did given where the euro started

709
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,080
going. Anyway. Um, I'm actually trying to get the price of the system on here while

710
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,600
that's loading. Why don't I just jump in here real quick in case you are wondering, you

711
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,920
hadn't heard the, the u s American currencies. I did pull up Amazon real quick to just kind

712
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,880
of most of what dark soccer said. If you just replace euro with dollars, it's pretty much

713
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,080
the same thing. Uh, the wifi system itself, two 49 99 and dollars. The first edition bundles

714
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,000
is going to be three 49 99. The games right now are all over the map. It just really depends

715
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,840
on what the game is. Like uncharted 49 99 little big planet, 39 99. Uh, but like hot

716
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:33,440
shots, golf, golf, golf. What is golf? Hot shots, golf. It's a cool game. Gore physical

717
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,360
game. Hot shots, Gore. If I'd buy that hot shots golf though is 29 99 as is wipeout 2048.

718
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,200
So I'm assuming maybe those games are a little, I don't know. It's hard to tell. Like touch

719
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,160
my Katamari is also 29 99. Is that indicative of the quality? I don't know. I hope not.

720
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:55,040
Well, we do have the list of, um, the, the u s release titles too. Not a, it's actually

721
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:01,280
says the full list from the u s PlayStation blog. On launch day there will be escape plan.

722
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,440
Um, hot shots, a golf world, invitational hustle Kings, little deviants, my nation racers,

723
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:14,000
road trip, super star dust, Delta, uncharted golden abyss, a wipeout 2048 and as far as

724
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,920
third party stuff goes, just to look this over and point out the stuff that isn't absolute

725
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,560
crap as far as I know. Um, blaze blue continuum shift extend. This is just a great name. Army

726
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:29,880
core of hell, luminous electronic symphony. Is that launch day or launch window says launch

727
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:41,120
day. Nice. Um, what else is on here? Uh, plants versus zombies, Rayman origins. Um, touch

728
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,400
of space, mutant blobs, touch my Katamari, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom versus, uh,

729
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:53,120
ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three. And as far as launch windows, um, does Gaia three

730
01:00:53,120 --> 01:01:00,060
Ridge racer, silent hell book of memories. So we're seeing some stuff. I think Ninja

731
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:08,320
guidance. Is that Sigma? Yeah, it's actually the Sigma symbol. I know my Greek. So yeah.

732
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,000
All right. So, um, yeah, Vita, I know I'm going to probably have to pick one up now,

733
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,720
especially that no luminous touch my Katamari. I will totally touch your Katamari. You want

734
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,920
to, I'll only touch yours if you touch mine. Okay. Uh, Alan, I know you're probably not

735
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,120
going to buy a Vita the day they come out cause you know, you'll play mine when I'm

736
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:30,480
at work, but what do you think? You're going to touch this Katamari when you touch my Katamari

737
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,400
while I'm at work. Yeah, probably. Are you excited about the release at all? Are you

738
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,360
just like, eh, whatever, another system, you know, I've heard Vita has had some mixed stuff

739
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,800
going on in Japan that there's been a lot of bumps in the road. I don't really have

740
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:50,440
the energy to like Stan or to be really fanatical about a system, but it took about a year.

741
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:55,800
It took about two or three years, but the PSP I thought was a really good system, a

742
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:02,280
really good handheld. And I really think that the PSP is underrated, dare I say it, because

743
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:08,880
the DS, which was phenomenal, sort of steamrolled it, which is a reality. But you know, I'm

744
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,040
looking forward to the PSP Vita because I thought the PSP itself was damn good, but

745
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:18,920
I just, you know, financially and with the time I have towards games, I can't really

746
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:24,620
get all that excited about a launch day purchase like I would have been 10 years ago. So maybe

747
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:29,360
for next Christmas though, once things get ironed out, the next Christmas, I'll want

748
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,920
a 3DS because if I'm doing things two years later, then I'll want, yeah.

749
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,880
Good to know. Good to know. I can start planning ahead. All right. Well, let's move on with

750
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,540
some more news, Alan.

751
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,000
There was a recent interview with Kojima of Konami, the mastermind who wrote the Metal

752
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,680
Gear series and reminiscing about Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation 1 and how amazing

753
01:02:51,680 --> 01:03:01,120
it was. And just him looking back on the experience and he was basically answering speculation

754
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:07,920
about a possible Metal Gear Solid remake because they are doing the HD remake for the PS3 of

755
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:14,340
I believe it's Metal Gear Solid 2 and Snake Eater. But Metal Gear Solid, the original,

756
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:18,640
isn't a part of it. So people are like, well, obviously that was the most famous of the

757
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,920
3 because it was groundbreaking, you know, especially on the, it was probably one of

758
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,000
the best looking games during the entire PS1 life cycle. Does that mean that they're going

759
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,680
to be releasing one separately? And Kojima has just said, you know, that's ultimately

760
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:41,360
it's Konami's decision. If they want to do a remake of it, that's fine, but he won't

761
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:46,500
really like, he doesn't care enough. He thinks the game is perfect or is good at it as is.

762
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,960
He didn't think any corners were cut that he would want to go back and rewrite parts.

763
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,760
He thought that the story was complete the first time it was told. So they're welcome

764
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:01,400
to do it, but Kojima is not really saying that he's psyched up about wanting to remake

765
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
it.

766
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,640
Would you, do you think it's worth them or worth it for them to put the time and effort

767
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,560
into remaking the first game? I mean, I kind of get why they're doing that because I think

768
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,360
they're probably taking the easy way out with the 2 and 3 remakes, you know, just quickly

769
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
up-rezzing.

770
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,720
It's like what the God of War, which I know it was Sony and not Konami, but it's just,

771
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,400
they were already nice enough graphics that they could just upscale the textures.

772
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,580
Right, which is probably what's happening with Silent Hill too. But this, you know,

773
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,760
going back and doing the first one would be, you know, they're not going to be able to

774
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,760
do that as easy.

775
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,920
Didn't they kind of remake one already for the GameCube with Twin Snakes?

776
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
Yes.

777
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,600
That was, the script and the voice acting was changed a bit, but it was still ultimately

778
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,160
that game. The story was retold.

779
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,880
And it was really great. I mean, I thought it was probably, of course, we have just about

780
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,280
every Metal Gear thing that comes out, so it was really great.

781
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:57,460
Yeah, so with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes for the GameCube, that's kind of like if they

782
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:03,280
did an HD remake of Resident Evil when we have the Resident Evil remake on the GameCube.

783
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,800
Again, totally different franchise, but it's the same thing. Like, we've already kind of

784
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:13,640
had that. So, you know, if, I mean, let's be real. If they remade Metal Gear Solid HD

785
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,680
as a separate release, people would buy it. So if Kami wants money, they should do it.

786
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,520
But Kojima is just, you know, he's not.

787
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,520
But a lot of people would rather they just put that effort into making a Metal Gear Solid

788
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,520
5.

789
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
Yes.

790
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,520
Which, story-wise.

791
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,520
Which obviously you would want Kojima on board for that.

792
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,520
Right.

793
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,520
Because it'd be a new story.

794
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:36,520
Right. So, all right. Well, moving on. It was brought up earlier in the show that Steam

795
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:41,120
is having a crazy sale right now. I wanted to just take some time to kind of talk about

796
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,560
a lot of the crap that's on sale.

797
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,720
I did get Bastion.

798
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,520
Did you? Were you able to buy it through the website?

799
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,520
Yeah.

800
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:52,440
Nice. Well, Bastion is five bucks right now. Skyrim is 33% off. Batman Arkham City is 50%

801
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,500
off right now. That's crazy. There's lots of other games. And in fact, I even saw somebody

802
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,400
in chat earlier, I think it was Pod Culture said, damn it, I just spent 20 bucks on that

803
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,240
sale. Like, curse you, Evil Steam's Tales. Like today, or the first, is really kind of

804
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,880
the encore day.

805
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,680
Magica is a good pick. That's $2.50. LA Noire Complete Editions, $12.50. I mean, that game

806
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:17,880
was just six months old. So it's interesting. A lot of this stuff that's on sale. What's

807
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,600
also interesting is the competition that they're doing. Well, it's a competition. What's the

808
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,720
right thing to call it? The achievements for loot, basically.

809
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
Yeah.

810
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,680
They have these set achievements and with them, you can win little coupons for games.

811
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,360
Like I got a 75% off Left 4 Dead 2. Basically like, have the sale anytime you want type

812
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:44,720
of thing. Or you can get little pieces of coal. And the little pieces of coal can either

813
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,520
be contest entries into winning every game Steam has ever put out ever, is the grand

814
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,840
prize. Like you would never be able to play all that. Or I think you runner up prizes

815
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,320
are like all the games on your wish list and like every Valve game ever made and you know,

816
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,680
things like that. What's interesting, I was reading about this and something I want to

817
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:10,520
bring up. I just read about this today. I guess Steam ran out of the third party prizes.

818
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:14,020
Like if you get seven pieces of coal, you're only going to be able to get Valve stuff with

819
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,640
that now. There's nothing third party you can get with that now.

820
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,200
There was a game I'm blanking on what it was that was released on Steam. I think it happened

821
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:27,600
a year or two ago where they ran out of the license, like the codes, like the CD key code.

822
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:32,040
You get one of those digitally. They didn't have, like they ran out so they couldn't sell

823
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,920
the game anymore because they didn't have the manufacturers. So it's probably the same

824
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,320
thing here. They gave away the little free.

825
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:44,020
Or the agreement was they would take the loss up to X many copies. But a lot of people are

826
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:49,520
upset because there's been those accounts out there that have kind of been abusing this.

827
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,920
We had a story a couple weeks ago about people were creating accounts just to trade the games

828
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,020
and get the coupons and trade, you know, kind of setting up all these sock accounts and

829
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:04,920
Valve had to do this. So a lot of people are kind of upset with the way this played out.

830
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,520
And I'm kind of of two mindsets. I'm like, well, honestly, Valve does a lot more than

831
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,400
most people do when it comes to cheap games and that stuff. So I kind of like they don't

832
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,840
owe you anything. But at the same token, if I was really working towards something and

833
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,680
then found out, oh, they're out of it, like on the last day I got it, it would be frustrating.

834
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:28,800
Certainly. You've been trying to save up coal. Were you going to cash it in now? Maybe not.

835
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,880
I need two or three more and I have no idea what is even available. And now it sounds

836
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,440
like thanks to this story, there's even less available for me to look at. So I'm even less

837
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,440
motivated.

838
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,840
Is there anything Valve you don't own? Counter strike?

839
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:48,180
Counter strike and just stuff that I don't care about because it's multiplayer or whatever.

840
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:52,660
One thing, though, about this whole sale and these achievements is that it really shows

841
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:58,760
how Valve works with the developers of these indie games, because especially with like

842
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:04,700
Toki Tori, whenever Valve has one of these sales on Steam, there will be several games

843
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:09,260
that will get updates where the developers have designed Christmas content specifically

844
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:16,820
for Steam, which is unprecedented. And Toki Tori had, it was basically the first world,

845
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,340
but it was all reskinned with snow and Christmas trees. So the developers went in and added

846
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:25,760
that for the sale. And Super Meat Boy, same thing. There's now a Christmas world for this

847
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,760
sale that you can go in and play.

848
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:32,680
The one for Beat Hazard was mean. You have to play 10 minutes of Christmas music without

849
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:37,840
dying or without losing. And I did it twice and lost it nine minutes, 30 seconds. I was

850
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,840
so pissed.

851
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,560
So you and the developers of Beat Hazard were like, all right, there's a Christmas sale.

852
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,320
We're going to add Christmas music. Your Steam client will update the game automatically

853
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,660
for this sale. Like that's, I can't really think of any other example of when that's

854
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,660
happened.

855
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:56,420
Well, I love, well, the outside of Steam. Yeah. But I was going to say the Portal 2

856
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:01,620
release. Remember they had the whole unlock Portal 2 early thing on Steam and they had

857
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,920
special achievements and like audio surf. Like I remember one day I went to go play

858
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,220
audio surf and suddenly Portal 2 music just showed up like, and like I tried to play a

859
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:14,840
song and it was like, GLaDOS is taking over. And, and suddenly it was a Portal 2 song that

860
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,640
was really awesome. So I like when they kind of do stuff like that. So, yeah, you know,

861
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,180
but you know, I like this comment from Derek H in chat, especially if the thing they are

862
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,240
out of is digital and therefore not real.

863
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,920
That's frustrating knowing that, Oh, you just ran out of something that's on the internet.

864
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,420
Well, it needs a license, but yeah, no. So, um,

865
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:43,020
Advances themselves are more for inventory and marketing purposes.

866
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,180
Well, my thought was that they just have an agreement with the developers. Like, Hey,

867
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:50,140
we're not going to give away unlimited amounts of 75% off your game. It's going to be limited

868
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:55,120
to 100,000 or something like that. You know? And I think for the sake of those third party

869
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,860
developers, many of them indie, I get it. And I cut them some slack.

870
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:03,620
Whatever they sell, they have to report back to the manufacturer because they have those

871
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,620
agreements.

872
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:09,120
Sorry. I love Derek H's follow up comment. It's like running out of birthday wishes.

873
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:16,960
I was going to wish you a happy birthday, but I used up my last one three days ago.

874
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,020
When I woke up this morning, I had like five or six fucks to give, but now it's three o'clock

875
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:26,080
and I don't have a fuck anymore. You missed. I'm you're too late. If you caught me a noon,

876
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:31,860
I would have gave a fuck. But now I don't act deaf in chat says, uh, clarifies the abusing

877
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,280
of this, uh, sky.

878
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,480
Many people cheated and had multiple accounts on steam to trade coals and stuff with themselves.

879
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,040
So why do you need all these fake accounts? Get a significant other Alan and I traded

880
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,220
stuff.

881
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,520
If I have any coal, you guys can have it. There's nothing left to get with it. Like

882
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,900
the only, this is why I don't even do this shit. No, seriously. I didn't sign up for

883
01:11:55,900 --> 01:12:01,320
any of it. I'd do it. Cause you know what? I have other stuff to do. Well, when I'm the

884
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,800
winner of every steam game ever, you can't play it.

885
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,560
Well some of the achievements are have, have a wishlist or make, make sure that your wishlist

886
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,420
has at least 10 things in it. That was worth a lump of coal. So if you created 20 accounts

887
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:18,800
and you added 10 games to your wishlist, you could then pipe all of those other 19 other

888
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:26,180
coals to your, so some of them weren't necessarily game achievements. It was just steam interaction.

889
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:32,160
Then I'm sure I have a coal. So I'm too good for coal. What are you talking about? We want

890
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:37,520
diamonds. I guess what sky is trying to say is that if you're forever alone dot JPG, the

891
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,540
sales isn't for you then apparently cause you need a, you need a, you need a partner

892
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:47,960
to help you do this. No forever alone on steam. Um, some folks are talking about Skyrim and

893
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,200
I just wanted to say, cause this made me think about, you've been playing challenge accepted

894
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:56,160
cause you don't chat says I want Skyrim on PC for the mods. The mods are going to be

895
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,920
sick. I've been playing on PlayStation three and I've been watching Alan play it on PC

896
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,680
and I'm like, no, I kind of want it on PC cause like you had a inventory mod or something

897
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:11,040
that yeah, I downloaded a mod from Skyrim nexus that basically makes managing your bag.

898
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,600
Like I can sort by weight so I can see what all the heavy shit is that's weighing me down

899
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,120
so I can get rid of it. I can sort by weight. I can sort by, yeah, so it's an awesome add

900
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:26,200
on to make bag management and Skyrim awesome and you can do that on PS three. So act Defton

901
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:30,800
chat says, guy, you really have no idea. There are people with over a hundred multiple accounts.

902
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,680
Good thing they got banned. Well yeah, good thing they got at least valve band them. Some

903
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,920
companies may not have even caught it. So you know, at least they got banned. But yeah,

904
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:43,080
I agree that, you know, I don't think valve is this type of company though. Again, I just

905
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,680
kind of look at their track record. Steam overall has been a great thing for the community.

906
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:51,720
It really has. Yeah. Um, and I think in the long run they'll kind of look back at this

907
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,360
and go, okay, next time we need to, if we're going to give somebody coal for getting their

908
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,880
wishlist done, we need to make it so that they can't trade that to somebody else who's

909
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,720
already unlocked it for the same reason. Like they'll go back to the drawing board and I

910
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,440
think they'll fix it for next time or they'll do something different. You know, they'll,

911
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,840
they'll learn from it. I think they will, but it does. It does suck that it had its

912
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:18,080
issues this time. Um, all right, let's move on with more news. Gosh, we're having a long

913
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,080
show.

914
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:23,040
Let me show the story that I was going to read. How about it? I guess I can lift that

915
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:28,320
cease and desist order. Well, actually it was a Activision that put out the cease and

916
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:36,880
desist on a dude who hacked Skylanders Spyro adventures. Anyway, um, this guy named Brandon

917
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:43,760
Wilson had a hacked the game to where basically figured out the conversation between the piece

918
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:50,240
and the game so that he could basically mount any piece he wanted to in the game. And so,

919
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:56,880
uh, so, so he figured out how that little, little, uh, um, toy and portal magic portal

920
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,680
were talking to each other and he got, he put it up on the internet, which of course

921
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:07,440
that's what they send out the cease and desist. Right. And, um, he wrote out, um, a note that

922
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:12,900
said, you know, what, uh, that the accusations were inaccurate, you know, that he wasn't

923
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:17,360
really sharing them with other people. He had them on a zip file for his own use and

924
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:24,200
he wasn't circumventing the game. He was basically just using stuff that was available and not

925
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:32,360
using, um, uh, the hardware on a iOS device. And he didn't really trick anything. So he

926
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:37,440
just, he just figured it out. He just found it out. He didn't actually use it. Well, are

927
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,440
you able to rip off Activision by doing this? Like you can't just suddenly magically buy

928
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:48,320
the figure. You can just make the, if you use another system to make it think you have

929
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,360
the figure, but doesn't, isn't there still like a code for the DLC? Like you can't just

930
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,780
magically download something that isn't there. Right. Like would you be able to exploit and

931
01:15:55,780 --> 01:16:00,480
steal money from Activision by doing this? Or is it just, you figured out how magnets

932
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:07,340
work? Yeah. You figure out how magnets. Well, I mean, but I mean, there are inevitably going

933
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:11,420
to be, would it be somebody that wants to know how the magician does the trick? Well,

934
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:16,880
I'm double checking something on here. He basically just found out how they connect.

935
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:23,100
So I'm trying to find where exactly he listed that. I'm pulling up. I'm asking chatter says

936
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:28,640
I have not played Skylanders yet. So chatters, how do you, do you have to have a code to

937
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:36,640
get the DLC? Um, RFID and uh, as soon as just playing the seat to figure out how to work,

938
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,800
how it worked and he put up the way it worked. And so I guess maybe it's Activision is afraid

939
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,480
that someone's going to use that to seal. Oh, no. You mean if the game is successful,

940
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,760
people are going to try to rip it off? If it's successful. Yeah. I understand it's been

941
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:58,160
doing all right. So anyway. Yeah, I think that's pretty much it. I think he just got

942
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,840
bored, figured it out and save the information for himself and then people, and then activings

943
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,920
like, Oh my God, people are going to use it and steal from us. All these five year olds

944
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,960
with their toys. And so, uh, dark to see in chat says this talk of Skylanders makes me

945
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:19,400
want a new version of barcode battler. I wish you could see how I would just rolled my eyes.

946
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,920
I remember those things are awesome subbing for Loki tonight. Should I be throwing shit

947
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,200
and screaming about Skylanders? Cause we're talking, we're talking about it. Go ahead.

948
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,960
But don't throw anything cause all the stuff near you is heavy. No, I was going to say,

949
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,120
this is, I wouldn't throw stuff in dark Sakura's house either, but like everything that I would

950
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:40,960
hit with stuff that we own. So Skylanders makes me very angry there. It's my Loki rant.

951
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:48,440
That was a pretty crappy impression. All right. Uh, folks in, in chat aren't really, um, uh,

952
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,880
able to answer the question about Skylanders, but I do see Derek H says, Oh, well of course

953
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,560
there's a delay. There's like a minute delay. Derek H in chat says, so corporations are

954
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:02,760
now trying to make it illegal to learn. I think it's the specifics they don't want getting

955
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:08,340
out there. You know, again, I, I don't think it's a big deal. I mean, if this, cause they're,

956
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:13,000
if this guy can reverse engineer the thing and figure out how it works, don't you think

957
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,680
EA's already got somebody on it? They're just not going to post to the internet that they

958
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,080
figured out how it worked. You know, they, they probably emulated it already or either

959
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,680
they have their competing version for their own franchise franchise is going to come out

960
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:29,920
at the end of next year. You know, I think the thing is though, if that, if this somehow

961
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:35,480
allows people to download free DLC, then that's going to be an issue. But at the same time,

962
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:40,700
if they didn't think that far ahead, then I don't want to say they deserve it, but they

963
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:48,560
were asking for it. Hackers going to go cry, cry me a river, build a bridge and get over

964
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,240
it. Well, I'm pretty sure those figures have to come with a code that you have to input

965
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,120
to actually get the DLC. Otherwise the figure just, you know, tells the portal, this is

966
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:01,060
the one I want to use or, you know, maybe we take it to friends houses, whatever. Well,

967
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:06,860
if it works, if it works on just, you know, talking to, because I think that that would

968
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:11,080
make sense to not exactly have a code for it, but to have it just, you put the figure

969
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,960
down and it connects. I think that they might've been confident that no one would be able to

970
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,760
figure it out. But then again, that was, that was, that was a dumb assumption. That was

971
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,480
a stupid, stupid assumption. How many other video game companies have done the same thing

972
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,600
is what I'm saying. Again, I don't want to say they deserve it. Our security is foolproof

973
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:34,120
too. If that's, I don't want to say they deserved it in that case, but derpy do. That wasn't

974
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:39,960
a smart decision. No, but, but it's been going around. It's a common thing amongst, you know,

975
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,200
developers. No one's going to figure this out. Let's just, you know, be all confident

976
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:51,840
and kiss our own asses. No. So. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out

977
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,760
some release dates, some games that are coming to a store near you. I kind of don't think

978
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,000
there's a lot this week. Wonder what that could be. Could it be that the holiday period

979
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,440
is now over? So, uh, but we'll see if there's anything after all. Um, Alan, you're filling

980
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:10,840
in for Loki tonight. What about the US releases? Well, according to, um, the source that we

981
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:18,840
use, it looks like there's one solitary, sad little game coming out this week. Um, it's

982
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:25,000
going to pick up next week. I believe on the 10th is a, is some of the 2012 for Q1 releases.

983
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,840
I think you start, especially towards the 31st. I think you have a couple of big ones

984
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:34,040
on the 31st. But between now and the next episode of OLR, we have Anarchy Reigns for

985
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:40,760
the 360 and that is it. And I couldn't tell you the thing about it. So there you go.

986
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,960
Um, I'm going to Japan to look at, well, I'm not going there physically, but I'm going

987
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,160
to look at their releases of things that are coming out and I got to tell you, I don't

988
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:52,840
see a damn thing coming out in Japan. I'm looking quickly to see if even the 3DS. Well,

989
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:57,400
don't they have any week two VITA stuff or did it just have it launch? Nope, it just

990
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,880
had this big launch. The next big game coming out is Wipeout 2048 on January 19th and Tales

991
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:07,320
of Innocence. It comes out on the 26th. Otherwise, you know, they already, you had a huge launch

992
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:11,760
and you're not going to wait one week to put out your game. So did you hear those stories

993
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,720
though about that? Apparently the 3DS is outselling it already in week two. Someone in chat was

994
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:24,640
saying that I think it was Ranma. It was like LOL at VITA. So, Hmm. Maybe this was the 3DS

995
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:30,600
strategy the whole time. Sure. Right. Yeah. But you know, whatever it is, it'll be interesting

996
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,280
to see if, if the numbers are the same here. You know, I don't want to be all like fan

997
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:39,560
boy and root for one or the other. I'm interested in both, but it's certainly not a good sign.

998
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,820
If you look at the technology of what the VITA has feature wise and what it's trying

999
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:48,440
to do versus the 3DS, which is just, Hey, it's a polarized 3D screen that you don't

1000
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:53,560
need glasses for. I think the VITA is trying to accomplish more with the technology that's

1001
01:21:53,560 --> 01:22:00,220
in it. But Hey, sometimes that just goes to show bleeding edge technology and you know,

1002
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:05,440
the perks aren't necessarily what move the system. All right. Well, um, no releases in

1003
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,120
Japan this week. So how about Europe? Well, to quote a line from one of my favorite movies,

1004
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:17,760
space balls, we ain't found shit. That's it. A very slow release. One game coming out in

1005
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,040
the entire world. I personally don't give a crap about us coming out on the 10th. What's

1006
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,680
that? That Gotham city imposters. What is your hatred for Gotham city imposters? It

1007
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:31,360
looked, it looked silly, silly, cute. That's kind of part of my problem. It's like, it's

1008
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:35,320
a bunch of wannabes and you know what? If I'm going to play a wannabe, I'll just play

1009
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:44,260
DC universe online, which I can't follow that. I can't follow that. And it was shit. Wait

1010
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:51,680
a minute. I, it was shit. I wouldn't say it was shit. Okay. It was, um, here a fart. Here's

1011
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:57,840
it. Look, DC universe was definitely not. Wow. DC universe felt more like teenage mutant

1012
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,280
Ninja turtles, the arcade game than it did. Wow. I hate the control. And if you're not

1013
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,840
into that, then you're, of course you're not going to be into DC universe and I hate the

1014
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,800
camera, but I thought PVP was a lot of fun in DC universe. I gotta say I, but you're

1015
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,520
not a player versus player kind of person. No, I'm not. And I will dabble in it. I'll

1016
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,560
experiment with my previous statement. And if I want to play a superhero game, I'll go

1017
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,440
back and play city of heroes. That's fair. And if I want to play, um, a game by that

1018
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,820
company, I'll just play Star Trek online, which I'm going to once it's free. Isn't that

1019
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:37,960
later this month? Yes, it is. I've been reading on the road to a F2P blog that is every time

1020
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:43,120
that they do an expansion or something, it's road to whatever. So now they've got, um,

1021
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:51,580
number 25 of the road to F2P, uh, blog going on. So I'm pretty excited. Well, of course

1022
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:56,400
you've ruffled the feathers of our chat room, dark Sakura. I don't give a shit. Brad from

1023
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:03,360
pod culture says, Oh no, she didn't. Oh yes I did. Tiger cloth says Gotham city imposters

1024
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:09,440
looks amusing. It looks like a bunch of people in bad cosplay costumes shooting. Yes. Yes,

1025
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:16,640
yes, yes. And if I want bad cosplay, I'll go to Fana Mae where there's occasionally

1026
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:25,560
some good cosplay. Derek, Derek H has drawn a line in the sand and says city of heroes

1027
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,200
is a lot crappier than DC universe online, but it has better control and better camera.

1028
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,920
Alan, you, you were a DC universe or excuse me, you were a city hero stand for quite some

1029
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,880
time. I just played it for like 20 minutes just yesterday. It's free to play now. Um,

1030
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,400
city of heroes has a very strong RP community and it's still kicking. So yeah, that's say

1031
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,280
sea of heroes is, but if you're not into RP, like I don't know when I, when I listened

1032
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:51,960
to dead pixel live and what I know of Derek H, he doesn't strike me as somebody that's

1033
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:57,140
really into RP. I mean, it might, it might be like a, you know, the secret lives of,

1034
01:24:57,140 --> 01:25:01,560
you know, that, that, that, but I just don't get that. That's why he plays games. My favorite

1035
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,800
thing to do though was in city of heroes make costumes, which is actually the same thing

1036
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:11,680
that the only thing I like doing in DC universe. Why are you playing Barbie the game? You should

1037
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:18,720
see how I play Sims. I spent all my Sim game building the damn house and deciding what

1038
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,320
they're going to look like. That's what you fucking do in the Sims is you build a house.

1039
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:28,300
But I don't do any of the get married and have babies shit. If I do anything, it's go

1040
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:33,320
sit in the park and play guitar and get a lot of money and then go home. Hack computer,

1041
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,280
go home. You are living out your fantasies of being a bum. That's what you're doing in

1042
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:43,200
the Sims. You are living out your fantasies of being a bum. No, I can do that in real

1043
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:51,920
life. I'm unemployed. No. All right. Fun, employed, fun, employed. Let's move on a couple

1044
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,400
more news stories for you guys. Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1045
01:25:55,400 --> 01:26:03,640
But first, Alan. Well, we have another classic game story before Dark Sakura gets into hers.

1046
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:09,120
For those who remember the Sierra Online text adventure games, the big three franchises,

1047
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,840
King's Quest, Space Quest, and Police Quest. Well, the fandom community for those games

1048
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,200
is still going strong and a group called... You forgot Quest for Glory. Yeah, Quest for

1049
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,160
Glory came later. Oh, judging you so hard right now. I love that series too. Infamous

1050
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:31,760
dash adventures dot com just released their HD fan community remake of Space Quest II,

1051
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:38,440
Vohaul's Revenge. The original came out in 1987. Space Quest only had two games that

1052
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:43,880
were the really blocky 16 color EGA graphics. Why are you smirking? What do you want to

1053
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:49,600
say? No, I'm looking at chat. I'm not smirking at you. I'm just looking at chat. I promise.

1054
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:57,880
And then Space Quest III, The Pirates of Pestilon had a graphical update, even though it was

1055
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:03,880
still text-based. But yeah, Space Quest II is probably the best one of the whole franchise

1056
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:09,040
to be honest, or at least before they went to point and click. It took them five years

1057
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:14,360
to get this out there. But yeah, it looks like on the 30th of December, just two days

1058
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:20,360
ago, it's final. You can play Space Quest II with updated graphics due to the things

1059
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:25,160
to the fans that go through and revamp this stuff. I would really suggest if you are interested

1060
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,960
in this at all, you grab it now. It's free, right? Yeah. So you should probably grab it

1061
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:33,740
now because as soon as everybody gets back to work on Monday and the lawyers are back

1062
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:38,700
at work, there'll be a cease and desist letter. Any predictions tomorrow? Tuesday? This gets

1063
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:45,560
cease and desisted? What do you think? I think by Monday, five o'clock. See, there's a different

1064
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:51,040
community that remade King's Quest III, and I think four, Perils of Rosella, which I think

1065
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:56,120
when I sat in for Dark Sakura was my pick for classic game. Those are still up there.

1066
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:00,080
Those didn't get C&D'd. Really? Well, what about the whole silver lining thing? That

1067
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,380
was a new property, I think is why. And then the fact that King's Quest... Telltale Games

1068
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:08,440
is getting a new property. Right. And at the time we didn't know that King's Quest had

1069
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:13,480
been handed off and there's gonna be a new one coming out from Telltale. And that silver

1070
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:17,200
lining went through this whole ugly thing where it was like, yes, you can do the game

1071
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:20,880
as a fan game. No, you can't do it at all. Okay, yes, you can do it, but it can't say

1072
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:28,120
King's Quest on it. I mean, finally it fucking came out. But if that's what... I kind of

1073
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:32,160
look at what happened to the silver lining and I'm like, this is not gonna last. Yeah.

1074
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:36,320
There are fan remakes of some of the original King's Quest games that I know are still out

1075
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:40,800
there that have been out for a year more. Also, King's Quest is Roberta and Ken Williams

1076
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,040
and Space Quest is the two guys from Andromeda, Mark and Scott. And Roberta don't give a fuck

1077
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:50,080
anymore. Yeah, she's... She has said fuck off to the game industry. She lives in a cabin

1078
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:54,780
in the Yosemite. She has accomplished the American dream of living in a fort and get

1079
01:28:54,780 --> 01:29:01,680
off her property. Yeah. You know, bless her heart. But the fact that she did King's Quest,

1080
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:06,360
somebody else owns it now. That's a pro. It's probably why she bought a fort. Yeah. You

1081
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:13,880
know, and I'm not lying. I believe that she does live like in a outwards, you know, type

1082
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:18,360
of thing. Yeah, but Space Quest 2 definitely improved on the first one. It's hard as hell.

1083
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:23,320
It's text-based. Save often because you will die and it's possible, like with some of the

1084
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:28,480
other Sierra games, to save your game past a point where you didn't pick up the item

1085
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:33,880
that you need to beat the puzzle and you literally have to start over. And I just want to be

1086
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:38,040
clear when I joke about the whole cease and desist thing. I don't want to see this thing

1087
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:41,880
get cease and desisted. I think this is a great, you know, imitation is the finest form

1088
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,560
of flattery. Yeah. And obviously people have very big spaces in their hearts for these

1089
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,160
types of games of yesteryear. I will probably if I can download this and play it because

1090
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:54,440
I used to love these games. You know, I was more of a King's Quest person than a Space

1091
01:29:54,440 --> 01:30:00,400
Quest, but nonetheless I'll still play and check it out. But I just, you know, I also

1092
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,520
unfortunately am all too familiar with the business side of things and how these things

1093
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,760
tend to get shut down. So we'll see. Well, just this last year, Streets of Rage got the

1094
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:13,120
super hella fan remake and that was one, two and three plus a bunch of extra fan added

1095
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:19,360
crap. That was up for a week before Sega was like, nah, nope. Take the hint game companies.

1096
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,840
I mean, I realized Telltale's like kind of trying to crank those out and that's kind

1097
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:30,960
of their niche now, but you know, they can't do everything. So maybe people want to see

1098
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,920
it. They can try. It's Vivendi Activision that I think has the Sierra properties. I

1099
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,800
will say I am stupid excited for a new King's Quest game from Telltale. I think it's going

1100
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:45,120
to rock. Yeah. So I just, you know, please don't let me down with this Telltale. Please,

1101
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:49,600
please don't let me down with it. But I, I'm, I have high hopes for that. That's, that's

1102
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:54,200
a series that has been gone from the gaming community far too long as King's Quest. These

1103
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,520
other games and King's Quest eight mask of eternity was a horrible nightmare. It never

1104
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,480
really happened. So just, you know, I would have moved into a fort too if I pushed, put

1105
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,920
that game out. Yeah. Yeah. Well no, that wasn't her, but I thought it was no mask of attorney

1106
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:11,440
was developed by nothing to do with Kings. I thought she still kind of oversaw it or

1107
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:15,320
her name was just on it because she ended grant. The plot of it was about some night

1108
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:22,400
goat arriving in Daventry and becoming King after King Graham. But that the whole style

1109
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:27,360
of it, cause it was like I so view three D where you like, it was like an action game.

1110
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,600
It was, it was, it was awful is what it was. Yeah. So yeah, no, that wasn't Roberta Williams.

1111
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,440
Huh? All right. I thought for some reason she had something to do with it, but maybe

1112
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:41,440
it's just because she invented King's Quest and all. Anyhow, moving on. Uh, some stuff

1113
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,000
that is coming to Xbox live arcade, thanks to all these different ratings boards around

1114
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,720
the world, we know some of the games that are becoming to Xbox live arcade within the

1115
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:55,220
next year. And there's some interesting things that are on here. Uh, AMY, but the battle

1116
01:31:55,220 --> 01:32:00,180
rising bang bang racing, deep black episode one and two defenders of our Dania dungeon

1117
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:07,520
fighter live happy action theater haunt. I am alive. Uh, next week's coral Rayman three

1118
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:13,760
hood, limb havoc, retro city rampage. That's that grand theft auto. We type game, uh, saints

1119
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,840
row money shot, a spinoff game that apparently from what I was reading about this game, it's

1120
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,920
some type of little mini game where you play the bullet and you try to go through as many

1121
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,080
things as possible as the bullet. It sounds very over the top and very saints row, a scary

1122
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:35,000
girl shank to the Simpsons arcade game that had been leaked earlier. Uh, sign Mora, Sonic

1123
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:41,960
the hedgehog for episode two, uh, spelunky Tetris party challenge, warp world gone sour

1124
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,040
and racketeer. That is like a compilation of everything over the past few months that

1125
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:51,120
has been leaked from ratings boards and other websites. Uh, that's what the roster will

1126
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:57,160
look like for 2012. That's a good six months or releases right there. I'm sure. So there

1127
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:03,120
you go. All right, well, we've been talking a lot about classic games and indie games

1128
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:10,760
and so forth. We need to take a step back in time to a simpler time when there was no

1129
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:17,960
DLC or patches for games. If the game was broke, it was just broke. It's dark soccer

1130
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:22,360
has picked a broken game. Just kidding. It is a little broken. Sometimes dark soccer

1131
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:26,080
has picked a mighty fine game as a classic game of the week. And as I understand tonight,

1132
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:31,200
kind of a, a nod to, you know, I don't usually pick these kinds of games, but that, that

1133
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:35,680
dot, right? Well, actually it was one that I found myself enjoying quite a bit when it

1134
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:39,520
came out. So this is going to be surprising to a lot of people, even though I've brought

1135
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:49,680
it up before and the game is WWF WrestleMania 2000 for Nintendo 64. Yeah, I, I, I said it,

1136
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:57,920
I picked it with its bad guitar synthesizer sound. Um, basically it, um, it came out in

1137
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:04,720
1999 or it actually came out in 2000 in Japan for Nintendo 64. It was, um, based off of

1138
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:13,320
their annual pay-per-view event. And honestly, this was when I was watching WWF regularly,

1139
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:23,560
you know, during their whole attitude thing. It was the NWO and, uh, China, China. Yeah.

1140
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:32,720
Oh man, that one was a mess. I was a big China fan at the time. You know, back when, uh,

1141
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:38,840
everyone was laughing because, um, Stephanie McMahon got boob implants, like, and you can

1142
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:44,240
totally tell the difference between one episode and the next. And you know, all the best divas

1143
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:54,080
coming out at the time, you still had, um, uh, fabulous moolah and, uh, what was her

1144
01:34:54,080 --> 01:35:02,020
name? May, May, what's her name? Her buddy. They were, you know, we were both fantastic

1145
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:07,640
wrestlers in their day. You're asking the wrong people wrestling trivia. May young,

1146
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:13,800
May young, who would threaten to show her puppies. That was, that was like the best

1147
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:19,500
era of wrestling ever. You know, you had Test back in the day and you had, uh, the Hardy

1148
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:29,480
Boys and, uh, Kidman. Um, I remember his last name, but that was like the time that I would

1149
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:34,120
totally be into wrestling. And Dan and I were both watching it and we loved it. So when

1150
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:38,400
this game came out and everyone's like, this is the best wrestling game ever. You gotta

1151
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:48,200
get it. Guess who got it? That was us. So, um, when it came out, it actually had like

1152
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:54,280
this amazing story mode. You had Royal Rumble, you had King of the Ring, you had, uh, the

1153
01:35:54,280 --> 01:36:00,480
pay-per-views. Yeah. And the, the story modes were like watching the TV episodes, all the,

1154
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:06,280
the, you know, steroidal man drama you can handle. Cause honestly I think that wrestling

1155
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:17,880
is, uh, um, soap operas for straight dudes. No, some of the chatters are chiming in. Um,

1156
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:24,020
you know, we're a little bit delayed here. May young, uh, ivory Tory Wilson, Lita, Billy

1157
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:32,360
Kidman, attitude era, reality era. Yeah. And you know, you also had a lot of stuff going

1158
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:37,400
on with, uh, Steve Austin. So there was that going on too. Yeah. I have never played this

1159
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,800
game, but I'm loving in the background. I see some of the signs. One of the signs says

1160
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:49,960
China suck it. That's awesome. I was hugely into WWF at the time. Um, like all babies

1161
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:54,920
kids were, but there was a part where I think half of it was that I kind of grew out of

1162
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,920
it and then half because I remember it was Roddy Piper versus Hulk Hogan. That was the

1163
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,920
big, that was the, that was the big war of good and evil was Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan.

1164
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:11,320
And then a lot of the major characters left and it was stone cold. It was stone cold Steve

1165
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:17,540
Austin that brought it back from the doldrums because they had an icon again that they could,

1166
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:21,460
you know, he was, he was awesome. But by then I think I had outgrown it. Um, I remember

1167
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:26,240
playing some of the, the PS one wrestling games that were good though. Yeah. Well I

1168
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,800
have to tell you about, okay, the create a wrestler mode in this was actually super good

1169
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,560
and they had a lot of the moves of some of the famous Japanese wrestlers who, because

1170
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,480
what happens I think is that they saved the same engine and use it for like, um, whatever

1171
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:49,940
the fire pro wrestling and the various ones over there. Um, but it had all the signature

1172
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:55,660
moves and you could do custom, uh, a stage entrance when you did the create a character

1173
01:37:55,660 --> 01:38:00,320
so you could actually design everything that happened when they come out on the end of

1174
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:04,200
the ring. You could choose their starting music and it would actually have loops of

1175
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:10,040
some of the original music, but you know, it's an incentive 64 cartridge. It was really

1176
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:16,400
limited on the samples that it can handle. Um, but it was just super fun. I mean, we,

1177
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:25,720
Dan and I made this guy who is in degeneration X. Yeah, yeah. NWO was a WCW. Degeneration

1178
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:34,640
X was the big one for, um, for WWF and we made this guy and he won every match and we

1179
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,440
would just put him in autoplay mode so you could just watch him play. And, um, he went

1180
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:44,580
every match in every title, including the women's belt. He beat China for the women's

1181
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:50,920
title and it was just so super fun. It was a really fun game, but like some of the characters

1182
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:58,480
that you had, the road warriors and Hulk Hogan and Taka Michinoku, who was a legend in Japan.

1183
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:06,960
He did not get enough nods over here. You had, uh, um, you could actually create some

1184
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:13,800
of the WCW characters because, um, I believe it was THQ, but they had the same, um, they

1185
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:18,640
had done the other games too. So you could actually recreate Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Scott

1186
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:27,680
Hall, you know, you can even make Macho Man. Uh, there were, um, if you had two, if you

1187
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,840
were doing a tag team match and you actually picked people who were on the same team, it

1188
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,120
would, you know, have them be introduced under their team name instead of just their individual

1189
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:44,120
names. Um, you had, uh, all kinds of stuff. I think you could also do Hell in a Cell and

1190
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,340
you could do, uh, I don't think you could do, I don't remember if the ladders, tables

1191
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:54,760
and chairs matches were in it at the time, but those were pretty fun too. Um, you actually,

1192
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:59,400
the commercials, I remember they were funny too because you had the Rock, um, doing Christmas

1193
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:06,840
themed ads. Yeah, Kane was in it and the under faker, I mean the under biker, I mean the

1194
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:11,080
undertaker. He's still around, right? Yeah, he's still doing it. I don't know why because

1195
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:15,280
that man's had knee surgery and back surgery and everything else, surgery. You know, what

1196
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:21,760
was the best about this? It had mankind in it. Oh wow. I remember him. Uh, Mick Foley.

1197
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:28,780
Yes. And Mr. Sacco. He would put a dirty sock on his hand with a mouth drawn on it and shove

1198
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:35,680
it in people's mouths. Oh, even I remember that. That was awesome. I remember insane.

1199
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:42,520
I had to learn wrestling because one night and this, you can, I know this was the doing

1200
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:46,880
of Travis and Jessica over at under station live because we used to all do Rocky horror

1201
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,600
in Sacramento together. We did a wrestling night one night. I don't know who's suggesting

1202
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,880
that was, but I somehow think Jessica was a part of it. I don't know why she has the

1203
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:58,200
metal blade. I remember she was heavily involved in that, but I had to learn wrestling because

1204
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:03,960
I had to play one of the characters because we did, we did, we played wrestling people

1205
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:10,220
in Rocky horror. That was the invention of the metal bull bra. Yes, it was. I was supposed

1206
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:17,680
to be Steve McMahon, the owner guy as Vince McMahon. I was Vince McMahon. Yeah. At least

1207
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:23,960
I didn't say Ed McMahon. I was Vince McMahon as riffraff was fun. Cause like I had, I had

1208
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:29,240
the sister or daughter or something. It was magenta and we were like boobs and we were,

1209
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:33,040
you know, like riffraff and magenta in the movie. That's pretty funny. If you're into

1210
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:38,220
Rocky horror, it was really funny. Like it's like, seriously, one of the most, um, fun

1211
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:42,020
fucking shows we ever did because we actually had our own TLC match. It was tables, ladders

1212
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:51,800
and cookie sheets. I'm sitting in front of the bar and we had a fucking table and a ladder

1213
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:58,160
and a cookie sheet. That's great. And you know, I miss, I miss, um, the deadly boys

1214
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,080
because they would actually set the, they used to be in ECW, which was like the really

1215
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:07,600
hardcore wrestling association and they would just set tables on fire and throw each other

1216
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:11,720
through it. Anyway, anyway, sorry, back to games. Anything else you want to say about

1217
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:16,560
the game? Um, you could get special copies that had a special hologram card with it that

1218
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:23,760
had, um, different pictures of in game action, like an entrance or a finish. So, but I mean,

1219
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:28,720
it was just an awesome game and it had everything at the time that you would expect to see on

1220
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:35,000
TV. And yeah, the music was kind of crap, but who cares? It was fun. And I mean, and

1221
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:41,280
like I said, Dan and I would just, I would spend hours making a character and then let

1222
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,640
them watch him play. Just watch him play it. Like we had that one dude who was in purple

1223
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:53,960
and lime green who beat everybody. And I think he had like Sean Michael's hair. So, so he

1224
01:42:53,960 --> 01:43:00,440
had a bullet. All right. Anything else to say about wrestling? I miss when wrestling

1225
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:06,640
was good. Some of the chatters would say it's still good. All right. There it is. Your classic

1226
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:11,680
game of the week. Alan was going to say, you don't like John Cena, the John Cena era. I

1227
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:17,560
like John Cena. I do like John Cena. I have to say, I like him because he doesn't look

1228
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:25,440
over-weighted and he's actually good. I liked the rock because he wasn't acting then name

1229
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:33,080
a good movie with the rock in it. Can't do it. I was actually going to say, um, the mummy

1230
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:38,760
too, cause he was in it for five seconds and he was, whatever. All right. I did like scorpion

1231
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:45,280
King. We're done. That's classic game of the week. That man looks good in tight pants.

1232
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:54,320
WWF. Yes, because it was the WWF back then. WrestleMania 2000 on the Nintendo. All right.

1233
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,920
We're going to take a break. When we come back, we have plenty more horizontal to come,

1234
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,680
including the all important, the moment you've been waiting for all night. I'm sure game

1235
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:05,760
of the year, 2011 discussion. I don't know what dark soccer is going to pick. I don't

1236
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,840
know what Alan's going to pick. They may not. They, they don't know what I'm going to pick.

1237
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:12,360
Alan thinks he knows, but maybe I changed my mind. So I'm worried at least one or two

1238
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:15,900
of ours will be the same. So, well, we'll see. It's okay. Because you know, there is

1239
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:19,240
no right or wrong answer. Also your picks for game of the week. We're going to come

1240
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:25,640
up with the OLR game of the year for 2011. All when we come back, um, you might be surprised.

1241
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:29,800
We'll see, or you might not be. We'll see. So we'll be back with plenty more of orange

1242
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:40,740
launch radio right after this. Stay tuned. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

1243
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:47,760
We are live on this first of January, happy new year, 2012 with the 440th episode of our

1244
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,320
show from the new studio set up. Although if everything's been done, right, you shouldn't

1245
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:56,320
really be able to tell at all that it's a new setup. Uh, Rob Roberts, of course here

1246
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:01,280
with you with dark Sakura and Alan tonight filling in for Loki. It occurred to me, I

1247
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:07,480
realize why we have less background noise and extra reverberation. What's that carpet.

1248
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:11,240
That's yeah, that's a big part of it is that you don't have the sound bouncing everywhere.

1249
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:15,180
Yeah. It's kind of the way it's partitioned is differently too. It's just, you know, setups

1250
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:19,640
are going to be weird. So, uh, anyhow, Loki of course, we'll be back next week. I don't

1251
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:23,360
want anyone thinking funny business is going on, but it is technically a holiday and, and

1252
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,400
uh, he, like many other people has to go back to work tomorrow. So I think there's a dinner

1253
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:30,120
thingy going on tonight that he's at. So, uh, he'll be back next week to talk game of

1254
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:33,880
the year with us. Uh, but the three of us that are here tonight, we'll get into our

1255
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:39,280
game of the year picks here shortly, but first we've got to talk about some rapid fire news.

1256
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:45,120
So Alan, since you're filling in for Loki tonight, why don't you start us off by the

1257
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:50,640
way, it was a slow news week. So, uh, there's kind of some less stories and we usually have

1258
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:58,880
just, you know, yeah, there is a MMO coming out in China, I believe called the age of

1259
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:05,100
Wulin and a certain gentleman, uh, who wants to play this game very much went to an auction

1260
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:11,520
being held by the developers, snail games. And, uh, basically he bought an online item

1261
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,540
for his character. Once this game comes out, he's going to have, I guess some Epic God

1262
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:25,840
tier sword for his character that he spent, um, us dollar equivalent $16,000 for, for

1263
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:33,140
a weapon for his tune in a game that no one knows sort of gigantic E penis if it's even

1264
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:38,400
a good game or not. Now looking at the screenshot and I think this is a, um, yeah, the, the

1265
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:43,800
official age of Wulin trailer it's on YouTube. It looks pretty. So vision, I mean, obviously

1266
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:49,120
it's not some back alley studio that is making an ugly game. It looks pretty, but yeah, 16

1267
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:57,940
grand for an Epic item. Also at this auction, they sold a, a sheath, meaning not a weapon.

1268
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:01,840
It's the thing that you put your weapon in for your character for the hook of departure

1269
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:11,480
for $1,600 and another sheath for the Lordly spear. I'm not, yeah, uh, for 2,500 just does

1270
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:16,680
he get his name in the game or any special thing for spending this much money? I mean,

1271
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,380
I don't know. Like I've heard of people like spending a lot of money on an eBay auction

1272
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:26,120
because they can win a role in the game or the money goes to charity or you know, something.

1273
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:30,280
But this doesn't appear to be the case. It sounds like, um, I would hope that this item

1274
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:34,200
would be bound to his account. So whatever character he rolls can use it. Maybe he'll

1275
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:39,200
be able to kick everyone's ass in PVP. I don't really know enough about the game to know

1276
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:45,160
what this is going to do for him, but it looks like he received a commemorative plaque that

1277
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:50,560
with his name engraved on it by a snail games saying the, you know, thou, Oh, this you now

1278
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,680
own this sword and you're awesome cause you gave a 16 grand for it. Um, and it's a one

1279
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:59,460
of a kind items. So the graphic, I guess of visually the texture of how the sword looks

1280
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:03,560
in its name and its stats, he's the only one in the whole system that's going to have it.

1281
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:08,720
So his EP will be even bigger. Yes. You know what? When I would do stuff like that for

1282
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:16,900
my private servers on Ragnarok online, I would pay $5. Yeah. And I, when I was in the city

1283
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:22,440
of heroes, I would buy their costume packs, which was about three to six bucks for like

1284
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:25,880
mutant. Cause you know, when city of heroes like dark Sakura was saying there are millions

1285
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:31,400
of combinations of costumes for your character, some of them were DLC. So I've spent money.

1286
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:38,720
Um, I've raised change points. I've raised changed a, my main and wow. Um, I'm just not

1287
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:47,680
spend what you could buy a automobile, uh, for a perk. I have the most I've given blizzard

1288
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:51,860
is that I moved my character twice on wow. And that was, you know, that's 50 bucks that

1289
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:57,380
adds up. And the more I think about it, the more it kind of irritates me because blizzard

1290
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:00,880
kind of double dips in that way that you pay a monthly fee and you have all these micro

1291
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:06,000
transactions, but you know, they, they have a quality fucking game. They can get away

1292
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,880
with it for now. Yeah. That's why, that's why the star Wars thing actually excites me.

1293
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:14,220
I think competition is healthy. I think competition is going to be very healthy thing. I hope

1294
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:19,100
star Wars does legitimately, you know, even though I say two games can coexist, I do hope

1295
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:23,560
the two games can kind of tug and pull from each other a little bit. It'll be, it'll help

1296
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:27,640
us all in the long run. And for the record, all the cryptic points, I did a lot of that

1297
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:33,560
in star Trek online. So that's why I have a defiant retrofit. And yeah, it looks like

1298
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:39,960
this game in China is entering open beta this spring. So it's, I should sign up for it and

1299
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:43,820
it looks like we are getting it here in the U S but it still needs to be put through open

1300
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:47,840
beta in China. So I don't think there's really a due date on when we're going to get it here

1301
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:53,640
soon. I played Ragnarok online in Korean. Yeah. So did I, I remember that, but for the

1302
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:57,720
I was like, Jamie, what do I do here? Jamie, what do I do here? You played with me on the

1303
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:02,760
American one on the American beta. I thought there was, I remember a translation patch

1304
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:07,640
for the career. There was a translation patch because some of the NPCs were still in Korean.

1305
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:14,440
Oh, okay. Then. All right. I played that one, but I played the Korean one before that. Whatever

1306
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:19,760
one that great. All right. It was fun. And this article does make a brief mention of

1307
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:24,520
the wank over elder scrolls for oblivion, which of course it was the game that came

1308
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:28,520
out before Skyrim, which is a lot of making a lot of game of the year lists right now,

1309
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:33,760
because oblivion had DLC where you could make pretty armor for your horse that literally

1310
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,320
did nothing. It was just, you know, metal for your horse. I kind of think the gaming

1311
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:43,400
community just needs to let that go. Like I understand that that is the quintessential

1312
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:47,200
like thing that people will point out for DLC, but also at the same time, Bethesda has

1313
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:51,800
come out and the industry has learned from that mistake that we will not do that again.

1314
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,960
That was, you know, you know what, nobody was fucking doing it then and we did it and

1315
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:04,440
we learned, you know? So, okay. Kind of a break. Anyhow, what else do you have for us?

1316
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:13,880
What do I have for you? Hold on. Pirated games via torrents or use net or whatever a list

1317
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:20,000
is. The Torrent Freak, which is a big sort of underground torrent news site, if a torrent

1318
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,960
site gets, like the Pirate Bay, if they ever get raided, Torrent Freak is usually the site

1319
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:32,160
that reports on it, you know, like, journalistically. They have compiled lists of the top pirated

1320
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:42,880
games via piracy or by digital torrent download. For PC, we've got Crysis 2, Call of Duty Modern

1321
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:46,360
Warfare 3, no surprise there, would have been probably number one if it came out earlier

1322
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:54,160
in the year. Top Wii game downloads, Galaxy 2, Mario Sports Mix, surprisingly, and Xenoblade

1323
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:57,760
Chronicles, which is... What the hell is Gal... Oh, Super Mario Galaxy 2. Yeah, sorry. Super

1324
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:03,280
Mario Galaxy 2. Perfect. Okay. Mario Sports Mix and number three is interesting, Xenoblade

1325
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:07,320
Chronicles, which you would think would be a no one cur game, but it's an issue of...

1326
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:16,080
It was translated in English for the Europe market and according to this, the tally, 950,000

1327
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:21,680
confirmed downloads via the various torrents that you could get this game on. And that's

1328
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:27,480
a thing where if Nintendo didn't have their head up their ass and put that out here, then

1329
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:32,360
maybe that number... But they are gonna put it out here, Alan. Yeah, too little, too late.

1330
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:37,600
Anyone here who wanted it either bought it and paid the 90 bucks to import it for their

1331
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:46,280
modded Wii from London or wherever their UK retailer is, or they pirated it. And of course,

1332
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:53,480
Modern Warfare 3 access isn't a problem there because America is the biggest market for

1333
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:58,080
that game and it's just people don't wanna pay 60 bucks for it. So sometimes it's just

1334
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:04,520
an issue of people being cheap. All right. But yeah, and then a top 360 pirated downloads

1335
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:10,120
via BitTorrent. Gears of War 3, no surprise there. And then of course, number two, Call

1336
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:17,520
of Duty Modern Warfare 3. So all the... Mostly the big multiplayer games. All right. Moving

1337
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:25,800
on to a couple... Speaking of piracy and torrents and all that, SOPA exists to try and shut

1338
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,520
some of that down, but unfortunately, the way it's written, it leaves room for a lot

1339
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:34,520
of other stuff to go wrong. And so obviously, a lot of internet savvy people are very much

1340
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:38,920
against SOPA. We've talked about it here on this show before. Obviously, we don't support

1341
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:42,960
it either here at Orange Lounge Radio. And it seems like the number of people that are

1342
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,400
supporting it are dropping. Obviously, I don't think I need to touch on it here. It doesn't

1343
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,840
really directly relate to video games, but I'm sure you've all heard about what GoDaddy's

1344
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,380
been going through with this whole thing. And obviously, they had quite a number of

1345
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:57,900
embarrassing PR stumbles, where I think you were hearing the Benny Hill theme playing

1346
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:03,060
in the background with every press release. Well, the good news is that Nintendo, Sony,

1347
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:10,000
and EA have all as well dropped SOPA support. An update to the government's list of SOPA

1348
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:15,380
supporters show that the names are now no longer on there. Of course, there is no word

1349
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:21,620
as to why. Is it because they saw the tech community backlash to what happened to GoDaddy,

1350
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:26,800
or maybe that whole debacle made them rethink the position, or maybe they just, you know,

1351
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:33,060
realized finally it was not a good idea? Whatever the reason, it's a relief to see these gaming

1352
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:39,620
companies are finally dropping out and taking their names off the list. Hooray.

1353
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:43,280
Some more rumors are floating around about Epic Mickey 2. Now, you might remember there

1354
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:47,660
was an earlier rumor based on a survey that had been out there, some type of like focus

1355
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:52,140
group thing that had people choosing the box art. Well, the rumors are circulating again

1356
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:55,940
this week because I guess there was an online newsletter that Disney put out that just flat

1357
01:54:55,940 --> 01:55:03,500
out said Epic Mickey 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii in fall of 2012. You

1358
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:09,780
might remember the original Epic Mickey game was a Wii exclusive, but maybe because of

1359
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:15,160
that or what, it didn't sell maybe as much as it could have. And so it's kind of interesting

1360
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:19,780
in a way that it is getting a sequel after all. Supposedly the sequel, Epic Mickey 2,

1361
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:23,620
will also have co-op play, including two player split screen, which is something we don't

1362
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:28,580
see in games all the time anymore. One person will be Mickey, the other will be Oswald the

1363
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:33,980
Lucky Rabbit. I love Oswald. So that's kind of cool. I like it because Epic Mickey kind

1364
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:38,660
of brings the classic Disney stuff. I wonder if the bad guy now will be Mortimer. Don't

1365
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:45,380
know. No word yet if Epic Mickey 2 may actually come out for Wii U instead of Wii. Right now

1366
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:50,340
they're saying Wii and that the Wii U ought to be backwards compatible. So there you go,

1367
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:54,780
Dark Sakura. Well, in other news, there's a fun little game that I just purchased today

1368
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:59,820
called Bastion. And apparently other people have decided to buy it as well because it

1369
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:07,980
exceeded $500,000. And that's an indie game. So I mean, it's really catching on, don't

1370
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:14,860
you think? At any rate, that's with Steam and Xbox Live arcade sales. So, and my apologies,

1371
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:23,460
I didn't mean dollars. That's 500,000 copies sold. My apologies. So yeah, good game. And

1372
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:26,740
a lot of people think so. To be honest with some of the deals on Steam and so forth, I'm

1373
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:31,140
surprised it's not higher. It's a quality game. Well, it's, you know, the story is also

1374
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:36,740
like from what, a couple days ago? So maybe. Who knows? Who knows? And it just said exceeded

1375
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:43,540
that. So. And also a really, really hard NES game has been translated into English. It's

1376
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:51,980
called Takeshi's Challenge. And to quote the article here, the game was made by the devil.

1377
01:56:51,980 --> 01:57:01,180
One of the ROM modders, King Mike, has translated it into English so you can play it. Is it

1378
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:07,180
like Beat Takeshi, the guy that was in Battle Royale? I want to think so. Actually, I'm

1379
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:13,980
pretty sure that it is, but I can find out. I am the very sure that it is from Beat Takeshi.

1380
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:18,060
Very cool. Yeah. And he had that, he sees, has the show that's been ripped off here as

1381
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:22,820
Wipeout, right? And that they didn't, they didn't take Takeshi's castle and they had

1382
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:26,820
the dubs that were on here in the States. Didn't they, wasn't that a thing? And that's

1383
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:34,660
still on? Yeah, it was Takeshi's castle and it was what the ultimate challenge. Yes. Yes.

1384
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:44,020
Exactly. So, all right. Hold on. What? Um, yeah, Takeshi no cho senjou and it is Beat

1385
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:51,700
Takeshi, Takeshi Kitano. Nice. All right. Well, before we get into some more news, the time

1386
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:57,140
has come for you to lip sync, wait, no, just kidding. For us to talk about the game of

1387
01:57:57,140 --> 01:58:02,700
the year of 2011. And we're going to go around the table and see what we here at OLR thought

1388
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:05,580
was the game of the year. We're going to start with a community. Obviously it's the show

1389
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:10,260
where every gamer has a voice and earlier this week on Facebook and Google plus in our

1390
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:14,880
communities there, we asked you guys, what do you think is the game of the year? And

1391
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,700
I wanted to make sure this is important. You guys understand there's no right or wrong

1392
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:23,060
answer. The whole point of the show here is that it's where every gamer has a voice and

1393
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:27,600
everybody's into something different. People can only afford sometimes to buy the games

1394
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:33,380
that were from last year or, you know, not everybody is necessarily into RPGs or shooters

1395
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:38,060
or racers. So I think this is important to really just kind of open it up to like, you

1396
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:42,300
know, actual gamers that are enthusiastic enough to be listening to a podcast and fan

1397
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:48,840
their page yet may not necessarily find the same critical darlings to be as successful.

1398
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:54,020
Or maybe they did. I mean sometimes, you know, what the critics pick really is the cream

1399
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:57,180
of the crop. So let's see. Let's start with the community first and see what some of you

1400
01:58:57,180 --> 01:59:03,520
guys out there said was the absolute bestest game to come out in 2011. Or I'm sorry that

1401
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,540
you played in 2011. It may have been a game that actually came out previously. Because,

1402
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:12,940
you know, God there'll probably be some games I don't get to play until 2012. Because 2011

1403
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:18,620
was so crowded with so many good releases. Can I also start off by saying, it was a great

1404
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:22,820
year for games. It really was. I know we come in here like every year and say that, but

1405
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:26,760
well I don't, I actually don't think, I think some people have said, it seems like every

1406
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:32,140
year we keep saying, how are we going to top last year? But I really feel like some years

1407
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:38,140
weren't as good with games. Like I don't remember looking back at last year going this was the

1408
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:43,500
best year ever for games. But this year was really, really, really good. Alright here's

1409
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:49,860
some of what you guys picked. Over on Facebook, Zether said number 3 Mario Kart 7, the best

1410
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:55,300
one. Number 2 Saints Row the 3rd, wacky insane, better than Grand Theft Auto 4 in every way.

1411
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:58,380
And his number 1 game of the year is Portal 2, an excellent follow up with a very good

1412
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:04,300
single player campaign and solid co-op. John Keegan said, I shouldn't say the full last

1413
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:10,540
name, sorry, John K said over on Facebook, best 2011 game, Arkham City, based on the

1414
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:15,720
variety of missions and improvement on an already awesome original. Otherwise I played

1415
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:21,980
older games in 2011 of which Assassin's Creed 2 and Uncharted 2 topped the charts based

1416
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:31,820
on an awesome story and solid gameplay. Derek W said, Resident Evil 4 HD, kind of a remake

1417
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:38,300
of an older game. Great injection to a boring year of military shooters, looks beautiful.

1418
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:43,860
Fallout New Vegas download content, the most rewarding and content heavy DLC seen yet.

1419
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:52,660
And number 1, Skyrim, Fus Ro Dah. Tom S said Skyrim, Skyward Sword and Saints Row 3, didn't

1420
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:57,180
really give reasons but those are the top 3. Mike B said, Gears of War 3, very well

1421
02:00:57,180 --> 02:01:02,580
done, kind of like a masterpiece of sci-fi shooters. Let me think about the other two.

1422
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:09,380
Times up! Johnny R says, number 3, Alice Madness Returns, beautifully haunting sequel to one

1423
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:14,060
of my most beloved games as a child. Number 2, Catherine, excellent puzzle game with a

1424
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:18,500
rad story to go with it. Number 1, Mortal Kombat, great fighting game that stepped it

1425
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:24,900
up with an amazing story mode. Oh, Mike B did come up and say, Saints Row 2, yes 2,

1426
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:36,700
not 3, I just discovered it in 2011. Kashiiko Janai, I think it's DJ Janai, says, number

1427
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:42,340
3, Super Mario Land 3D. I didn't watch a lot of El Hazzard, did I? A great blend of

1428
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:48,260
traditional Mario and new Mario styles. If only Sonic could achieve this feat, oh snap.

1429
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:53,900
Number 2, Portal 2, funny story, great puzzles, awesome acting. Number 1, Minecraft, the ultimate

1430
02:01:53,900 --> 02:02:03,940
never-ending sandbox of building ADD insanity. OMG! Joe R said, number 3, DDRX3 vs DDR Second

1431
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:08,660
Mix, still some love for the Bomani games. Well, it was either this or DDR2 and I noticed

1432
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:13,780
they still couldn't get the interface quite right. Number 2, La Mulana on the Wii, no

1433
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:18,580
surprise there. I think I'm more surprised that it's not number 1. He says, take what

1434
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:22,700
made Kade's story so great but throw in some extra block and switch puzzles. Also recently

1435
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:28,340
announced that a PC port will come to Steam. Number 1, The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.

1436
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:33,420
I'm digging up this one a lot more than Twilight Princess, great game expecting to sink at

1437
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:39,340
least 30 hours in before I'm done. Bradley B said, number 3, Chime Super Deluxe, adds

1438
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:44,340
4 good to great songs to the roster and adds perfect quads and changing layouts to further

1439
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:49,740
add to the gameplay. Number 2, Portal 1, or excuse me, Portal 2, oops, number 2 is Portal

1440
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:55,260
2, all around fun and adds so many more hilarious quotable quotes to the Portal universe. Number

1441
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:59,900
1, Bastion, the narration makes what would be a pretty good action game a great one.

1442
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:07,340
The narration adds a story that is full and vibrant and memorable. Miguel I says, Portal

1443
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:13,580
2, best sequel ever. Forza 4, best driving game to date, a great combination of arcade

1444
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:18,340
and simulation type racing. And Sequence, DDR and RPG combined into a really fun and

1445
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:23,420
addicting game. Jim H says, Infamous 2 improves on everything from the first game and the

1446
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:28,580
user generated content was a great addition. Number 2, LittleBigPlanet 2, any other year

1447
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:31,700
the sequel to one of my all time favorite games that improves on the original would

1448
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:38,980
be my number 1. And number 1 was Portal 2. He picked all 2's for his top list. Sticking

1449
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:42,140
with the theme, it's an improvement on the original, has some of the best storytelling

1450
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:45,820
and voice acting in gaming history. Add in the great gameplay and that makes it the game

1451
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:50,420
of the year. Let me quickly run over to Google Plus because we had a few responses over there

1452
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:59,820
as well. I wanted to read for you guys. And we had from DeadPixelLive commented, F1 2011,

1453
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:05,300
Forza 4 and Pinball FX2. F1 2011 because it did what a sport sequel is supposed to do,

1454
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:09,380
leave the good stuff in and add more good stuff. Forza 4 because the rival mode made

1455
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:14,220
driving and competing fun. And Pinball FX2 because at the end of the year I realized

1456
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:19,980
I had played it more than all my other games. Good reason. We have another response here,

1457
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:24,220
it's written in Russian so I'm not sure how to say this so I apologize. Dark Soccer, do

1458
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:31,140
you read Russian? No. Ok, so. Just pipe it through Google Translate. So unfortunately

1459
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:37,940
name I can't read, sorry ignorant American. Says number 1, Deus Ex Human Revolution for

1460
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:42,300
a great cyberpunk story and enjoyable gameplay. Too bad Exfer is not here. Exfer can read

1461
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:47,420
Russian. Little known fact about Exfer. I remember when he was learning. Thanks to Nelly.

1462
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:52,020
Number 2, Bastion, yeah cuz Loki's wife is Russian. And I remember all of the cards all

1463
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:56,600
over your apartment and I almost learned to read Russian too. You'd think I'd know more

1464
02:04:56,600 --> 02:05:01,620
after living there but. Anyhow, number 2, Bastion for very polished representation,

1465
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:05,780
great music and awesome narration. And number 3, The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings for old

1466
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:11,460
school hardcore RPG brought up to the next level on every aspect. Lastly, Wendy S says

1467
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:15,880
number 3, Battlefield 3, favorite shooter, loved the way they did multiplayer player.

1468
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:21,060
Number 2, NHL 12, favorite sports game, realistic simulation of hockey but not inaccessible.

1469
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:27,180
And number 1, Portal 2 drew me in like nothing else could. So those are some of the responses

1470
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:34,500
from Facebook and Google Plus. Very diverse. Did you guys catch that? Yes, but I put a

1471
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:40,040
game on my list that they didn't. Interesting. So we're about to get to that here in a minute.

1472
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:47,060
I wanted to quickly see if I could bring this up. I forgot to put it in the link or in the

1473
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:53,020
show role because over on NeoGaf there's a thread where they're actually tracking what

1474
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:57,900
the media, you know, all the different gaming outlets are naming as the game of the year.

1475
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:03,100
So I kind of wanted to give you an idea what they were saying, kind of what the rest of

1476
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:10,300
the internet is saying or what the critics are saying and so forth. Let's see. I'll have

1477
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:15,460
to try and dig for this a little bit here. Any games that the chatters mentioned that

1478
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:23,260
you were like, oh, I forgot about that game. No. Because they all like Angry Birds apparently.

1479
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:27,080
I don't think anybody said Angry Birds actually. All right, here we go. I found it. So this

1480
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:30,940
is from NeoGaf. Thank you to the folks over there that tallied this all together. Poster

1481
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:38,200
was Cheesemeister. Has tallied up what the media. 72 different outlets has picked Skyrim,

1482
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:43,420
and that's the number one. 22 outlets have picked Portal 2. 17 have picked Batman Arkham

1483
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:49,280
City. Seven for Zelda Skyward Sword. Seven for Uncharted 3, Drake's Deception. No listener

1484
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:54,260
put Uncharted 3. Very interesting. Four said Gears of War 3. Two said Bastion. Two said

1485
02:06:54,260 --> 02:07:01,260
Catherine. Two said Dark Souls. Two said Deus Ex Human Resolution. Two said L.A. Noire.

1486
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:04,440
Again, surprised I didn't hear that from any of the chatters either. Two said Star Wars

1487
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:09,320
The Old Republic. Two said Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP. And a handful of other

1488
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:17,260
games got a mention as well. So, who cares about what the media thinks? Let's talk about

1489
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:21,220
what we think. You know, I found our certificate where we were listed as the podcast of the

1490
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:27,180
galaxy. Good. We have a little space on the new studio wall. I'll have to remember where

1491
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:32,100
I put it. Go to Hobby Lobby and get a frame. Alright, let's go around top three picks.

1492
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:34,860
Hobby Lobby my ass. I'm going to the dollar store. We're going to do this kind of like

1493
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:40,540
we do Listless but without the elimination and not the voting so much. Let's go around.

1494
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:44,520
And of course, justify your pick. Alan, we'll start with you. What is your number three

1495
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:53,500
pick for best game of 2011? Skyrim. Skyrim. And 72 media outlets agree. I can see that.

1496
02:07:53,500 --> 02:08:01,480
Why did you pick Skyrim? It tries to do something that a lot of game developers are afraid to

1497
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:07,180
do. Bethesda, rather, the makers of Skyrim. Ever since the original two Elder Scrolls

1498
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:14,500
games which most people haven't played, Arena and I'm blanking on what the second one was,

1499
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:21,060
there were sandbox games before Grand Theft Auto which is where that genre and that term

1500
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:28,340
sandbox game came from. So you can literally do anything if you want to make a plate-wearing

1501
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:35,700
warrior who casts spells. You can go exploring for hours, ignore the main plot completely

1502
02:08:35,700 --> 02:08:42,660
and still have stuff to do. Bethesda with Morrowind and Oblivion and now Skyrim, that's

1503
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:48,460
always been their thing to make this really immersive, almost impossible to complete game

1504
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:54,940
and Skyrim is the best attempt at it yet where even I know people in real life that have

1505
02:08:54,940 --> 02:09:01,060
played Morrowind Oblivion and it was such a burden, all this openness. They hated it

1506
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:05,740
and Skyrim, there's something about it where they get better each time in streamlining

1507
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:12,980
that combination of keeping your attention plus, holy shit, this is a whole huge world

1508
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:16,660
to dink around in. Visually, it is gorgeous. It's one of the most beautiful games I've

1509
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:25,660
ever played, especially on my PC which is now four years old. And yeah, it's for kind

1510
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:34,160
of a... I get really into exploration and min-maxing stats and doing crafting and Skyrim

1511
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:40,420
has all of that. It's a great game. Now is it just me or for a game as vast as Skyrim,

1512
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:45,700
we really need a new fucking meme besides this arrow to the knee shit? I didn't get

1513
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:51,340
that until I finally was in a town and I heard some dude, I used to be an adventurer like

1514
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:54,780
you but then I took an arrow to the knee and I was like, oh thank you, it's something that

1515
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:59,700
some dude says to you. Now I finally get that meme. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was from the

1516
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:05,620
game but with a game so fucking huge, seriously there has to be something else. The 50,000

1517
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:09,140
cheese wheels off the mountain was funnier than an arrow to the knee, I'm sorry. There's

1518
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:15,740
a great picture of the Arl of Whiterun, the first king that you meet, where someone had

1519
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:21,600
stacked hundreds of carrots, apples, cabbages all over him and they took a picture and he's

1520
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:26,060
got his chin on his fist like a thinking man on his throne being all kingly and he's just

1521
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:32,780
surrounded by like cabbages. It's awesome. Alright, DarkSakura, what is your number three

1522
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:37,940
pick for game of the year? Batman Arkham City. Batman Arkham City, why'd you pick back Arkham

1523
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:43,900
City? Because, and I honestly didn't play it but I watched Dan play it most of the time

1524
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:47,820
and I just sit back and it's like watching a movie. It's what happens when you're married

1525
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:51,180
or in a committed relationship, sometimes you let the other person do the driving, I

1526
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:56,660
get it. Yeah, well, we've done that for tons of games between the two of us so, you know,

1527
02:10:56,660 --> 02:11:03,020
I just sit back and I totally dig the character designs. I love that they got Penguin right,

1528
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:10,860
that he's this British gangster kind of guy, you know, and Catwoman was absolute hotness

1529
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:16,580
except it is physically impossible to leap around like you do in four inch heels, just

1530
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:21,740
like that. But it was, it was gorgeous a lot and had, Dan said that it took a little, you

1531
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:26,580
know, time to get used to the control but the fact that it also brings over your information

1532
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:33,580
from the last game is a big bonus. And, oh my god, Joker. Mark Hamill's last performance

1533
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:39,600
as Joker. Maybe. No, officially. Yeah, but then they went and teased Arkham World and

1534
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:46,060
you're like. He said on Twitter that he would come back specifically for a killing joke,

1535
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:51,620
animated special. But yeah, it's interesting. Yeah. But throw enough money at him, he'll

1536
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:55,820
do it. No, I don't think so. Get him better seats at the VGA's next year. But that was

1537
02:11:55,820 --> 02:12:02,060
just like a fantastic performance. And I really liked their Harley too, especially you find

1538
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:06,460
the little Easter egg and, oops, spoilers, oops, you find a positive pregnancy test in

1539
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:12,220
their little love nest. And then in one of the endings, she's singing to her baby. So

1540
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:18,300
it's just lots of neat little things thrown about in there. And the whole business with

1541
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:21,820
Hush, that was pretty cool because that was actually the last Batman thing I ever read

1542
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:28,540
was Heart of Hush. I never, I was not a big DC person, but that was a really good storyline.

1543
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:33,300
So yeah, it was really cool. It had lots of nods to just all kinds of different characters

1544
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:41,060
and it was really neat. So that's, and also as a designer, love the design in the game.

1545
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:46,580
It's beautiful for me. I just have to start off by saying this has been extraordinarily

1546
02:12:46,580 --> 02:12:51,420
hard this year. There have been so many, not just good, but phenomenal games this year

1547
02:12:51,420 --> 02:12:56,700
that I have, like, I, I told Alan like three days ago, what my list was going to be and

1548
02:12:56,700 --> 02:13:00,040
I've changed it since then. I've changed it several times since then. And even now in

1549
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:04,460
my head, I'm like, do I really want to say this as number three or do I want to put this

1550
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:09,100
game in there because this game was so fucking good. Um, but I'm, I'm going to just commit

1551
02:13:09,100 --> 02:13:12,880
to what, what I'm going to say here. And I really think, you know, I kind of look back

1552
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:19,380
at fun and what game did I really enjoy? Um, I think my, my number three game of the year

1553
02:13:19,380 --> 02:13:25,780
is, um, Super Mario 3D Land on the 3DS because it, you know, and I said this on the show

1554
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:30,060
when I first reviewed it, I really think it is the greatest Mario game they have done

1555
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:36,420
since, uh, the Super Nintendo one. I think it's just the 3D works. It makes you understand

1556
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:41,700
why a 3DS, you know, can, can work. Um, it's one of those games where you keep peeling

1557
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:46,260
back the layers and even though it seems like, God, this game is easy as cake in the beginning,

1558
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:51,340
it just gets crazier and crazier as you move on. Uh, it has a lot of the retro stuff that,

1559
02:13:51,340 --> 02:13:55,600
you know, you know, we love retro games here at OLR that we love. I just, I, it's such

1560
02:13:55,600 --> 02:14:00,300
a worthy reason to own a 3DS. And I think that Mario 3D Land is my number three pick

1561
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:06,240
for game of the year. I think it might very well be the only 3DS game right now where

1562
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:13,720
the 3D is more than just, oh, that looks neat. Cool. Absolutely. It's in 3D. When you play

1563
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:20,020
Super Mario 3D Land, the 3D is an integral, integral part of the gameplay and the experience

1564
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:26,740
and turning it down, turning that little notch down on the side, like, it damages the game.

1565
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:31,800
And I love that you can have the, uh, you can invert the 3D too. Like, it's, it's hard

1566
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:34,940
to explain unless you do it, but it's very easy. You have it pop out or be recessed inwards.

1567
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:41,660
But it's still 3D. It's great. Uh, and I gotta remind you guys, I think still to this day

1568
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:47,620
that Mario 64 was quite a bit overrated because of a lot of its move to 3D. Yet I love what

1569
02:14:47,620 --> 02:14:55,800
3D has done to Mario here. I look at myself and I can't justify it. Like, it just works.

1570
02:14:55,800 --> 02:15:00,460
And that's why I think it's, it's one of the greatest games to come out this year. Absolutely.

1571
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:10,540
Um, Salacious Pop or Alan, your number two pick. Probably gonna say Dragon Age Origins,

1572
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:15,560
since you said this could be games that we played, um, in this year rather than came

1573
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:19,620
out. Uh, one of the reasons why I'm going back to a game from 2009 is that a lot of

1574
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:23,860
the big, the big A-list games that came out, like Deus Ex, I haven't played them, so I

1575
02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:30,780
don't wanna talk out of my ass and hype up a game I've never played. Um, BioWare, ever

1576
02:15:30,780 --> 02:15:36,060
since, you know, the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG has shown that they are one

1577
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:43,020
of the best narrative and character writers in the industry. Um, I would say even better

1578
02:15:43,020 --> 02:15:49,780
than Blizzard and Valve. And the twists and the, like, Alistair in Morrigan, who's, he's

1579
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:53,900
the, um, other Grey Warden in Morrigan is the Witch of the Wild, they're the first two

1580
02:15:53,900 --> 02:16:00,460
NPCs you pick up. They're so engaging and I was fascinated with each of them for completely

1581
02:16:00,460 --> 02:16:06,180
different reasons and they were acted and written so well. And I was very invested in

1582
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:10,980
how I manipulated the game to make sure that I got endings that were right for them. And,

1583
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:16,620
uh, it's, Origins is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and a lot of the, um, D&D

1584
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:22,420
game-based games that BioWare wrote in the 90s. And Dragon Age 2, if you play it, which

1585
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:27,060
I believe that came out earlier this year, um, the menu and the UI, it's all very new

1586
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:31,140
school. I'm not saying Dragon Age 2 is a bad game, but you can tell right away, even just

1587
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:38,500
by the menus, that it's a different, Origins really harkens back to the 90s experience

1588
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:41,100
for me, but with a present-day game or story.

1589
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:44,300
Alright, so even though you went with a game that's a couple years old, you can do that

1590
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:47,740
because this is your picks for best game of 2011 and sometimes you don't discover the

1591
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:48,740
games till later.

1592
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:54,340
Yeah, so for anyone who overlooked Origins, um, yeah, it's still relevant. Play it.

1593
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:58,620
Alright, fair enough. Dark Sakura, your number two pick.

1594
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:07,940
Ultimate Marvel vs. Ca- Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Galactus Flick. Bing! Making my hand hurt.

1595
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:15,220
Awesome cast. Firebrand. Um, but I still go back and play Phoenix more than anything.

1596
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:22,420
It's just fun. And She-Hulk, of course, because She-Hulk is hardcore. But yeah, it's just

1597
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:27,860
a fun fighting game. It brought out all the DLC characters plus more characters that people

1598
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:35,820
wanted to see except for no freaking Mega Man. But other than that, perfect. Fighting

1599
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:36,820
game perfection.

1600
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:41,860
Didn't bother you that it was only six months after the other Marvel vs. Capcom that also

1601
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:42,860
came out this year?

1602
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:49,500
No. Not really. I didn't buy any of the DLC.

1603
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:50,500
There you go.

1604
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:54,620
And you know, the tweaks and the gameplay actually made it worth it. It felt different

1605
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:55,620
enough.

1606
02:17:55,620 --> 02:18:00,480
Alright. Um, my number two game of the year. It's one that's already been named, but I

1607
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:07,300
think it's a game absolutely worthy of the list. I never expected to enjoy Batman Arkham

1608
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:12,900
City as much as I did. And I, you know, I like Batman all the way back to like the Adam

1609
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:18,860
West Batman. I admit I'm not as into reading the comics. I'm not as into the animated series.

1610
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:24,140
I mean, I watched it a little bit when I was a kid. So I don't know the Mark Hamill Joker.

1611
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:27,860
I don't know the characterizations of these characters as much as some of y'all do. But

1612
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:32,720
I, I'll be damned if I didn't just love this game. I mean, it's just the story in it is

1613
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:37,020
outstanding. The way they juggle all of the villains without making it seem like cheesy

1614
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:43,740
or over the top is great. I love the exploration. Love, love, love the grand theft Batman style

1615
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:49,520
thing that they have going on. Um, I think the DLC has done rather tastefully the way

1616
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:53,180
you can have, I mean, the whole Catwoman debacle outside where some people didn't have their

1617
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:56,360
codes, the stuff they kind of been doing beyond that, like the Nightwing and everything I

1618
02:18:56,360 --> 02:19:01,920
think is neat expansions to the game. I love the side missions. It's, it's a rewarding

1619
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:07,160
experience and it's, it's, it's the total package when it comes to a video game. Absolutely

1620
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:15,080
is. I have to ask you, did you do the, um, the, that were Catwoman abandons Batman? Yes.

1621
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:22,280
Isn't it great? Yes. Screw him. She's such a bitch. Yeah, no, the way that, I mean, just

1622
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:26,240
the way the characters are done alone, it makes the game outstanding, but just, it's

1623
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:32,120
just, I think you said it well when you said you didn't even play it and it was like watching

1624
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:35,880
a movie and that's how good it is. I mean, and then do you even take it a step further

1625
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:40,480
and actually kind of like get your hands on it and be in control is, is just outstanding.

1626
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:43,980
I did actually play a little bit of it. I mean, I'm not going to say I didn't play any

1627
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:48,840
of it, but it, it was Dan's save and I had, since I'd seen so much of it, I was like,

1628
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:53,120
there's no point, but I might go back and do it myself now. So much to go back for with

1629
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:58,800
the Riddler trophies and the little side in the Riddler mission. Oh my God. I barely dented

1630
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:05,880
that, which is actually pretty messed up. Yeah. And not that hard. So, all right, so

1631
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:12,760
now we're going to go around and get Z number one picks. Oh my gosh, here it is. The game

1632
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:21,200
of the year. According to us, Alan portal two, it really elevated the first game and

1633
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:27,140
it's very rare for when a sequel makes the game that came before it a better experience.

1634
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:33,840
It really showed that valve is a heavy hitter when it comes to casting a voice talent narrative

1635
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:40,160
writing and it's a hilarious game. It's an emotional game. You feel sympathetic for both

1636
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:47,800
Wheatley and GLaDOS. You would learn so much backstory for pretty much everyone, including

1637
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:53,760
even shell, if you know how to look for it. And it's, it's a very it's really just holds

1638
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:57,520
on to you to never let's go. It's, it's, it's quick. If once you beat it once, if you love

1639
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:01,520
the story so much, you can run through it again in a couple hours and it never feels

1640
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:07,880
stale. And it really valve, especially with half-life two episodes, one and two really

1641
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:14,720
have tried to increase their game as far as script writing and story being told through

1642
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:18,720
dialogue. But portal two is where they're really like, you're going to listen to this

1643
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:23,760
and you're going to be invested in these characters. And also here's awesome puzzle, you know,

1644
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:28,720
puzzle cracking to where you have to need to figure out what to do. So, all right, well

1645
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:35,880
justified. Dark soccer, your number one game of the year. I will answer it with a sound

1646
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:47,960
from my phone if it will play. I hope that made it through. It might have a little bit.

1647
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:53,360
It's a little quiet, but it made through it's a portal to definitely cause for all the same

1648
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:57,840
reasons that Alan said, and I've beaten it 10 times in single player mode, more than

1649
02:21:57,840 --> 02:22:02,520
10 times now in single player mode, I keep playing through that game. I've probably played

1650
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:08,400
through that game once a month and I go and explore and look for stuff. And while I haven't

1651
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:13,080
done the no clipping trick to, you know, see how the levels are put together, I still have

1652
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:18,480
such a good time every time. And actually, um, I've sat back now and watched, uh, the

1653
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:22,780
ending through third player mode. So it's kind of funny seeing these disembodied arms

1654
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:27,680
floating about for Chell instead of, you know, seeing her whole body attached to everything,

1655
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:31,040
you know, but that's, you know, part of the perspective and part of the camera. So it's

1656
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:37,720
very neat and poor Wheatley. And I love that actor so much. I was watching him on Graham

1657
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:43,520
Norton one time where he was paid a thousand pounds to be donated to charity to do a somersault

1658
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:50,640
on stage and he had never done one before. And this man is tall. This man is like a moose

1659
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:54,640
for well, people would get my reference from Supernatural, but anyway, he's tall. He's

1660
02:22:54,640 --> 02:23:00,800
very tall, very lanky. I think he's taller than you, Alan. Yeah. And just watching how

1661
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:05,520
good natured he is and the fact that he brings so much of himself into the character, I thought

1662
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:13,000
it was perfect. And you can really hear that fun part, even when Wheatley's being an evil

1663
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:19,600
bastard. It's just awesome. So that, and you know, the, the giant mutant potato and all

1664
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:24,800
of the reoccurring jokes. And I would even, I even went in and tried to find all the stuff

1665
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:31,000
that did make it into the final game, like the Garfield conversation in co-op mode, where

1666
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:37,200
apparently two little robots, Atlas and Peabody were supposed to go and find a Garfield comic.

1667
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:43,600
And she glad us rewrites it to say that John Arbuckle filled the house with neurotoxin.

1668
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:49,680
Too bad it's not Garfield without Garfield. God, that's great. I'll have to find you the

1669
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:55,760
little file to play. So, all right. Um, my number one game of the year might surprise

1670
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:03,760
some people. Um, but I, I really had to sit back and go. I don't ever, I don't ever beat

1671
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:07,640
video games anymore. And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that maybe I play

1672
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:12,880
these MMOs games. You can't beat the fact that I do this show, or I just love video

1673
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:17,440
games so much that I try to play as many games as possible. So I'm just never, I never have

1674
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:22,320
that attention span to play, to finish a game. And I know it's a notorious joke on the show.

1675
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:28,880
What bad gamer ADD I have that I never finish games. It's like, Ooh, sparkly. Go that, go

1676
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:34,620
here. But there was one game that came out this year that said, sit down and fucking

1677
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:42,400
play me till I'm finished. Just dance ABBA. That was the best 30 minutes of my life. Contemplated

1678
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:49,200
no, no, it's not just dance ABBA. Shut up. Uh, you can't beat just dance ABBA. Uh, but

1679
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:55,020
I have, I was absolutely sucked into this game start to finish. And it's just, it's

1680
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:59,520
an amazing fucking video game. And it's, it's the best video game of the year. It's portal

1681
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:04,080
to absolutely without question is best video game of the year. And it's, it's, it's everything

1682
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:09,160
these two said. And I will emphasize the fact that this game probably still would have been

1683
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:12,260
the game of the year without the co-op or the shit that they're, they've been adding

1684
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:16,520
to it since then. Haven't even touched COVID. Same. I haven't, I did play a little bit of

1685
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:20,480
the co-op. I beat co-op. I play a little bit of it and it's like, you know, that just further

1686
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:26,080
enhanced the experience of what was already an amazing game. And you know, the story was,

1687
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:31,960
was great. And I have to admit the first game I L I liked, but I didn't like love like dark

1688
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:36,720
soccer did or something. But this game, I think as Alan said a minute ago, made the

1689
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:42,840
first game that much better. It was so good. So, um, absolutely. Portal twos, my game of

1690
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:48,840
the year. So interesting that all three of us picked the same game in portal one, 90%

1691
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:52,920
of the story happened in the last, what, two levels of it. And the story up until then

1692
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:56,880
you could read the signs and a lot of it was really implied. And then at the end, the finale,

1693
02:25:56,880 --> 02:26:01,260
when you're doing the big escape, that's where you figure out, Oh, okay. Portal two just

1694
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:04,120
hits the ground running. You already know what the story is and it just keeps getting

1695
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:07,800
better and better and better and better. Oh yeah. Uh, this is what you wanted me to play

1696
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:13,240
dark soccer here. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, you made it to one of the human habitats.

1697
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:19,560
We're looking for an artifact. Think of it as an archeological dig. Their laughter centered

1698
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:28,080
around one of the objects in this room. That's it. Scan it for me. So this cat loves lasagna

1699
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:34,200
so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house. Oh, apparently it's not the cat's

1700
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:44,840
house or his lasagna. Oh, good. The man who owns the lasagna is furious. The end. The

1701
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:51,360
end. That's not funny. Do either of you feel like laughing? All right. I'm pulling you

1702
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:59,460
out. Welcome back. While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon. It's up on the screen.

1703
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:04,120
As you can see in my version, the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped

1704
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:09,600
with deadly neurotoxin dispensers. That which point the cat reflects on the time he ate

1705
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:18,600
all of the man's lasagna and feels remorse briefly. Reactions. Yes. It's funny because

1706
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:25,240
most of it actually happened. Do you feel more human? Well, let's do some tests and

1707
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:31,400
see what happens. Nice. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, I was telling the chat room earlier,

1708
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:36,600
but Dan and I were at Disneyland in line for space mountain going and the best of space.

1709
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:43,240
Space. Yeah. I, I, I, again, I stand by what we said earlier. We did not compare lists.

1710
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:46,920
So I had no idea that, well, I kind of knew dark soccer will go for portal two is number

1711
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:49,480
one. Like, you know, I just, there was no question. I didn't know Alan was going to

1712
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:54,080
go there too. So, um, very, very interesting that we all picked the same game. I would

1713
02:27:54,080 --> 02:28:00,000
say for the first time in 10 years, I think we've all picked the same game, but hold on.

1714
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:03,320
Loki's not here. And I kind of don't think Loki's going to go that way. He'd go saints.

1715
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:08,220
I think that's on a four. Well, that didn't come out this year. I think that was his game

1716
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:12,040
last year. I think he's going to go saints row the third, which admittedly I thought

1717
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:17,000
you, I thought it was going to be, Oh, I, it was so fucking, how is Skyrim not on my

1718
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:23,480
list? How, how is Skyrim not on my list? It wasn't, it was that good of a year for games.

1719
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:27,160
I mean, sky or Skyrim absolutely should be in my top three. I'm kind of don't care about

1720
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:33,460
Skyrim, but you, you, you're not really into those types of games though. I wouldn't expect

1721
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:39,000
you to like Skyrim yet. All this, all the crap that people do in Skyrim, I tried to

1722
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,560
do and wow, 50,000 cheese wheels off the side of the mountain, but I tried to like climb

1723
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:48,180
every mountain and try to get to places that no one can get to. And, but no, I will admit

1724
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:53,040
for quite some time, uh, saints row the third, just because of the fact, just the fun factor

1725
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:59,200
part of it, like that I have not laughed that fucking hard at a video game. Well, except

1726
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:02,080
maybe portal two. No, I don't even think, I don't think portal two, I laughed as hard

1727
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:06,320
as I did as saints row the third. I mean, it's just that fucking good, but it's just,

1728
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:11,600
I look back and I go, your three favorites got to make a commitment. And I think Mario

1729
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:18,720
edges it out slightly combustible lemons. So there you go. That was the part that cracked

1730
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:24,920
me up to no end. I think we'll be able to say portal two is going to end up the official

1731
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:29,380
OLR game of the year, just looking at the, uh, uh, feedback and so forth. But I, I Loki

1732
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:32,720
needs to have his say, so we'll get his input next week on what he thinks the top three

1733
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:37,200
games of the year are. Any guesses for Loki games? I mean, I think we have all said saints

1734
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:42,040
row. The third will probably be his number one, but what else for Loki games? Skylanders.

1735
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:45,840
I think he'll put Skyrim on there too. I think he'll, I think he'll put, I think he's going

1736
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:52,360
to put, what's that battlefield game. He loves battlefield three. No, not battlefield. What

1737
02:29:52,360 --> 02:30:00,600
am I saying? Like actual battlefield. No. Um, the 1840 or 1940 whatever that he plays

1738
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:06,280
with the ants. Oh, modern war. But they play call of duty modern warfare two right now.

1739
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:12,680
Oh, I don't know. So we'll, we'll see. I just not Loki loves sandbox games. He loves sandbox

1740
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:16,000
games more than anything. So that's why I think it's going to be Skyrim and saints are

1741
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,800
three saints row the third for sure. Yeah. But I don't know what else is going to have

1742
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:23,160
room in there. He'll kind of just say, ah, he'll, he'll just pull it out of his butt.

1743
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:27,040
He might go with portal two for like number three. I think he really did enjoy that. So

1744
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:32,640
we'll see. Only Loki knows. So he'll be back next week. Trismo five this year. No, I don't

1745
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:38,440
think he'd go for that anyway. So I'm thinking more Dan something if, if he could fuck around

1746
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:42,780
with it and hack it and stuff, that's the type of stuff he likes. I think his list will

1747
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:49,460
be portal to Skyrim and saints row the third, but we'll see. All right. I found you something

1748
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:55,400
else to play. You must play it. Oh, act deaf. And I think this is what you were thinking

1749
02:30:55,400 --> 02:31:00,360
of earth defense force. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Thank you. Good. Good call. Act deaf. Absolutely.

1750
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:04,520
Earth defense force will probably be in there. Okay. There's the last thing. It's short.

1751
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:08,480
Okay. Oh, what? Oh, you sent me to play. All right. One more thing. All right. Because

1752
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:15,040
we love portal so much. All right. Make this quick. I am a whore for portal. Yes. And that

1753
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:20,120
made me a hortil. That is earth defense force. Insect Armageddon. Yeah. He'd probably put

1754
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:25,160
that on this list. All right. Here we go. I've been thinking when life gives you lemons

1755
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:31,840
don't make lemonade. Make life. Take the lemons back. Get mad. I don't want your damn lemons.

1756
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:37,120
What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rule the

1757
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:43,160
day it thought it could give cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the man

1758
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:48,800
who's going to burn your house down with the lemons. I'm going to get my engineers to invent

1759
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:56,800
a combustible lemon that burns your house down. Burning people. He says what we're all

1760
02:31:56,800 --> 02:32:01,760
thinking. All right. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't have the one that had got us on there cause

1761
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:06,560
her comments make it extra funny. All right. So there it is. Our game of the year discussion.

1762
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:11,520
Hope you guys enjoyed or if you didn't, well, you're welcome to your own opinion. No. Well,

1763
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:16,220
we got your plenty of your opinions, uh, on the, I was surprised that only one person

1764
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:21,680
said Skyrim. I just, you know, when 72 media outlets say it, I'm kind of surprised, but

1765
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:25,000
I think maybe for a lot of people, it's one of those games where it's like Skyrim. It's

1766
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:29,280
up there, but it just, it just didn't crack the top three. I was limited by the fact that

1767
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:33,600
I play games two to three years late. And the fact that I'm playing Skyrim when it's

1768
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,560
only three years old is actually kind of amazing. And it's thanks to you getting three months

1769
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:43,040
old. Thanks to you getting it for me when it was cheap. All right. All right. Let's

1770
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,760
move on. Uh, more gaming news for you guys. We've got the mailbag FUs of the week and

1771
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:50,960
of course your phone calls coming up in just a little bit. Um, so let's go to Alan with

1772
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:58,880
some more news. So there's been a lot of wank going on, uh, lately due to a feisty, um,

1773
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:05,000
valve employee who was seen at an event wearing a half life. It's the half life lambda circle

1774
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:11,240
logo with a three on it. And people saw that and were like, Ooh, half life three is coming.

1775
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:16,800
Um, I'm a huge half life fan. And for those listening who don't remember half life to

1776
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:24,080
proper came out in 2004, um, nearly 10 years ago and half life to episode two came out

1777
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:28,360
in the orange box, which I believe when it, that was what, September of seven when portal

1778
02:33:28,360 --> 02:33:34,560
one came out. Yeah. So that's pushing, um, four or five years now. So people are like

1779
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:41,080
valve, what is going on with half life three or at least half life to episode three. Thanks

1780
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:47,200
to this t-shirt people thought, um, it's, it's coming. Like this is, this is a tease.

1781
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:54,520
Um, ultimately, uh, Chet Falisek, who is a writer for half life and left for dead. And

1782
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:59,720
he also occasionally hits up the official forums has said that all of the rumors that

1783
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:04,240
the half life community on the official forums has sort of dredged out and saying that valve

1784
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:09,240
is working up to something. There's an, there's an alternate reality game similar to what

1785
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:14,200
portal two had when they updated the ending to portal one, where you call into like modems

1786
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:19,920
and you download all of these images, all the, the portal two stuff, it's all trolling.

1787
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:25,080
It's all trolling by half life fans like myself, just trolling the shadow of each other. Um,

1788
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:30,320
there's no official ARG or if there is, of course it's, it's one of those sort of, you

1789
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:36,600
can kind of see through the, the subtext of his response saying, uh, you know, uh, this

1790
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:40,720
is his official response. You, you are being trolled. There is no ARG Wheatley speech was

1791
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:46,120
set in portal two fiction. That is all. There has been no directive from Gabe to leak anything.

1792
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:51,800
That is all false. So I would imagine there is something to leak, but you know, it's,

1793
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:57,560
it's all under lock and key by valve. I'm finishing his quote. I just want to say, I

1794
02:34:57,560 --> 02:35:02,080
just want to say this. So there is no confusion. This is the community trolling the community.

1795
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:06,080
Nothing more while it is nice to see people excited about anything half life. I hate seeing

1796
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:11,480
people be trolled like this. Thanks. So what we get out of this story is valve is still

1797
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:16,440
committed to half life. It's still going to take them a couple of years to put out any

1798
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:19,880
sequel. They haven't canceled. Obviously it's their bread and butter. It's the reason why

1799
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:23,820
valve is the company is it is, but all of this stuff that we're seeing right now to

1800
02:35:23,820 --> 02:35:28,920
do that employee with his t-shirt, it's all just trolling. They aren't, they aren't ready.

1801
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:34,720
How does that make you feel as a half life fan? Oh, frustrated. But you kind of knew,

1802
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:38,920
right? The minute you saw the shirt, I think you even said to me, somebody's just trolling

1803
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:44,380
better than he came out and said it. Yeah, that's true. Just leaving it to speculation.

1804
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:49,600
Even if he did get disciplined for it, it probably, you know, it's not a fireable offense

1805
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:54,240
for him to make a custom t-shirt that he knew was going to get the fandom to, you know,

1806
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:58,740
lose their minds. And even if he did get in trouble for it, we're not, we're not privy

1807
02:35:58,740 --> 02:36:03,780
to that information. It's none of our business. And plus how could valve not be doing half

1808
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:07,480
life three eventually, you know, like you said, it's their bread and butter and it's

1809
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:12,560
like, it's just, they probably just keep going back and changing stuff. I don't know. I kind

1810
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:17,960
of think it's coming soon. They're like, what else is left for valve to do? Unless it's

1811
02:36:17,960 --> 02:36:22,360
well, they're doing defense defense, defense of the ancients. That's in beta. Now defense

1812
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:27,320
is going to be out before he three. So what's valve got to talk about at E3 this year? Left

1813
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:32,580
for dead three. Well, I shouldn't say that cause I mean, it's not like left for dead

1814
02:36:32,580 --> 02:36:36,440
is a bad franchise. Or if they came out and said portal three, I think we'd all blow a

1815
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:41,360
load. You know, that would be great. But maybe it's a little too soon for portal three. You

1816
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:46,840
know, I would, even though I'm not as into half life as you, I'm kind of like, okay,

1817
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:51,400
give the half life fan, throw them a fucking bone. Let this be their year. 2012 is the

1818
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:55,680
end of the world after all. Let them have their goddamn half life. It was six years

1819
02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:00,640
between one and two and it's now it's eight between two and conceivably three if they

1820
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:04,200
would say anything about it. So it's just like, we know that you're working on it. We

1821
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:08,640
just want throw us a bone. And they're like, no, we're not ready. They're like blizzard.

1822
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:11,720
They're not going to tell a shit. And this is all just trolling that's going on right

1823
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:18,160
now. All right. At least you'll have defense of the ancients to hold you over. No one curve.

1824
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:23,540
All right. Uh, moving on to what I find to be kind of an interesting thing that happened.

1825
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:28,960
This has to do with the game fallout new Vegas. And I guess what happened is that the lead

1826
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:37,360
designer behind fallout new Vegas actually released a mod to go with the game. Uh, it's

1827
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:41,240
not an official patch because, and of course now the source story isn't loading for me,

1828
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:46,560
but I read it earlier and the official patch, uh, or they didn't want to officially patch

1829
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:50,880
it because it was changing the games in ways that they may not want to subject everybody

1830
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:56,720
to in terms of balancing and so on. So I think it's interesting that they, uh, kind of did

1831
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:59,560
it this way without doing an official mod. There we go. Now the story is loaded for me

1832
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:08,040
here. Um, you can download this mod direct from lead designer J E Sawyer and his website

1833
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:16,500
is Diogenes dash lamp dot info slash J Sawyer underscore FNV underscore mod.zip. But yeah,

1834
02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:22,560
it's for fallout new Vegas. It will, uh, turn up the difficulty, uh, putting it up there

1835
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:27,120
to what he wanted in terms of difficulty. Hence part of the reasons why they don't want

1836
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:31,000
to put it out there for everybody. And he also just kind of said, you know what, the

1837
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,120
game's over, the ship sailed, nobody's working on it anymore. There's no testers, there's

1838
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:38,800
nothing. This is just me doing what I want to do in my free time. So fallout new Vegas

1839
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:43,680
is done. So hold out hope for fallout four, I suppose, which would, I would think going

1840
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:47,740
to be their next game. Now that Skyrim is out there, I'll let new Vegas is pretty, pretty

1841
02:38:47,740 --> 02:38:53,720
good. I have to say. Yeah. So there you go. There is by the way, an ultimate edition of

1842
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:58,320
fallout new Vegas coming out on February 7th. That's, but that's just all the DLC from fallout

1843
02:38:58,320 --> 02:39:03,640
new Vegas originally all put together in one little package there. All righty, let's go

1844
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:11,640
to the mailbag. Yes. Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge trader

1845
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:16,400
dot com and dark soccer threatens to not read them, but then we beat her until she does

1846
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:22,120
beat, beat, beat that bat, bat, bat, bat. Okay. I'm going to treat you like a Justin

1847
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:30,600
Bieber pinata. Those things were hideous. Just some paper plates and party hats stapled

1848
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:36,080
together. Okay. So the first email comes from Robert M. Somehow I get the feeling that Jamie

1849
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:39,760
if she's in studio tonight has already seen this. What were you anticipating when I was

1850
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:46,960
definitely not being here, but I mean I wasn't really seriously thinking of calling in. Okay.

1851
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:50,280
If so, please post this link to the chat room and stop reading this now. Otherwise here's

1852
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:55,760
a pro toy, a customizer's version of the metal slug tank. Best of luck in the year ahead.

1853
02:39:55,760 --> 02:40:01,080
And yeah, I, um, I did see this and I will post it in the chat room and if Rama will

1854
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:07,160
be so kind as to, uh, put this picture and the link to the article on, uh, our tumble

1855
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:14,960
bubble. That's a little Lego. It's a Lego. It's cute. Uh, metal slug. Yeah. So I will

1856
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:21,720
post this in the chat room now. You know, also this music makes me kind of wish I was

1857
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:29,720
going on the Matterhorn cause it's kind of the same. Anyway, so this is comes from Holly

1858
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:33,120
D. Hey guys, I just wanted to share something that popped into my head when I heard about

1859
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:37,320
the poor guys on your show who have had their Xbox live impose screwed with, particularly

1860
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:40,880
the guy who said he gave them information to investigate and then they said his credentials

1861
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:45,360
weren't right even though they hadn't changed since he opened the case. We had a similar

1862
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:49,100
experience with Comcast over my internet bill except it wasn't a hacking. It was customer

1863
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:54,000
service fail. I switched to internet and cable from internet service. Well, next time I called

1864
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:57,760
to check the installation time was from my number. I gave it and they told me I was wrong.

1865
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:01,800
I was like WTF. The first one pretty much hung up on me. So I called back again. This

1866
02:41:01,800 --> 02:41:05,000
woman told me she could not access the account with me even though I was calling about an

1867
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:08,220
appointment I obviously knew already. I argued with this woman for an hour and she finally

1868
02:41:08,220 --> 02:41:12,640
found that my account had been closed and then the guy who set up the new service opened

1869
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:16,720
a new one and put in some bs number. So I had to reopen the old account, but she kept

1870
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:20,840
insisting that I had to go physically to one of their locations to fix it. I said like

1871
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:24,640
hell I was and I pointed out to her that if they weren't allowed to change the number,

1872
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:28,240
then who the hell gave him permission to change it in the first place. So she should could

1873
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:32,080
clearly see it had changed. After that she put me on the phone with her supervisor who

1874
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:37,540
fixed it. Took about two hours total. The basic point of this is to say that is to say

1875
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:41,140
try to point out the flaws in their logic and demand who know who authorized changing

1876
02:41:41,140 --> 02:41:44,640
the information. It gets results sometimes because you know if they're claiming they

1877
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:49,600
can't change it, then they sure as hell know who authorized the first change. I hope it

1878
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:55,600
helps and I hope they get their accounts back soon, Holly D. Yeah. You know what happened

1879
02:41:55,600 --> 02:42:00,440
with Comcast with us? We were supposed to have everything fixed on Thursday and Dan

1880
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:05,760
the night before, Dan had a phone call, an automated phone call that said Thursday and

1881
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,520
Dan had taken Thursday off work. Well then he goes to check it in the morning and it

1882
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:17,520
said Friday when Dan had to be at work. So he called me. I told him to call his supervisor,

1883
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:23,280
but I was also you know seven in the morning and asleep. So I just want to say Comcast

1884
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:29,120
automation, these automations and computers and stuff just leads to trouble. It's a problem.

1885
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:34,200
Fail is what it is. She had to talk to a human being to get anything done. Well, no, he Dan

1886
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:38,980
tried to talk to a human being and she wouldn't change it. Hey guys, it's Blade3 again. Just

1887
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:43,680
wanted to say sorry about my grammar a couple of weeks. I'm, I gave everyone a hard time.

1888
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:50,040
She gives everyone shit. But use a period after I go please. I was on a PSP 2000 semicolon

1889
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:56,000
and comma. That's wrong. By the way, I was wondering what studio equipment you use and

1890
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:00,300
setting up a recording studio and I was curious that should have a you in it about your mics

1891
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:09,280
and whatnot. Please keep it IP I guess it is it up the awesome work. Well, it's not

1892
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:13,240
as complicated as you think the setup. I know for a show that's been around as long as we

1893
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:17,100
have you think we'd have this fancy thing going on, but it's actually not that complicated.

1894
02:43:17,100 --> 02:43:20,840
Our first board came off the eBay. Yeah, the first board came off of eBay. The board we're

1895
02:43:20,840 --> 02:43:24,520
using right now. We did upgrade to a newer board some time ago and I'll tell you it's

1896
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:32,540
what's called a Euro rack. Yeah, it's by Beringer. You be one two two two fx Pro. There are pictures

1897
02:43:32,540 --> 02:43:35,260
if you look at the new studio pictures or as long as you do.com you can see the mixing

1898
02:43:35,260 --> 02:43:39,520
board sitting there in the background. It's really as simple as we have three microphones

1899
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:43,500
and they're all hodgepodge microphones. I'll take a picture and put it up right. I've got

1900
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:48,780
a RadioShack in my hand. Yeah, Loki's is from RadioShack dark soccer is a Beringer mic that

1901
02:43:48,780 --> 02:43:52,580
I think she picked up when she picked up the board. Yeah, mine was donated by DDR Angel

1902
02:43:52,580 --> 02:43:57,100
like eight years ago and it still works. She's like this is an expensive mic and I want you

1903
02:43:57,100 --> 02:44:00,480
guys to have it and it still works. This is actually I bought this one because my old

1904
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:05,420
mic died. Well, the DDR Angel mic is also a backup mic because it is sold. We actually

1905
02:44:05,420 --> 02:44:08,460
had another mic that broke and then you've got your courthouse one in the other room.

1906
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:12,020
Yeah, I know what that one's from. They all I think it's another RadioShack mic but they

1907
02:44:12,020 --> 02:44:16,700
all it's like a newer RadioShack mic. Yeah, so they all plug into the board and then you

1908
02:44:16,700 --> 02:44:21,340
know every mic that I've bought I've gotten at Guitar Center. Ah, and every mic I think

1909
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:25,740
I've got at RadioShack maybe one at Fry's but anyway they all plug into the board. We

1910
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:30,760
try to equalize things on the board. I realize our voices are not always equalized. We try

1911
02:44:30,760 --> 02:44:37,020
best we can to adjust things on the fly but unfortunately sometimes some of my co-hosts

1912
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:42,540
especially Dark Soccer and Loki tend to be very quiet if they're in a bad mood. Ah, and

1913
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:48,920
then they get very excited. Loki's worse though. I can talk about him because he's not here.

1914
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:54,620
Loki's a lot worse. By the way, look at our website and our little photos at top. I just

1915
02:44:54,620 --> 02:45:02,100
sent a picture of the computer and the soundboard. By themselves. And the computer was donated

1916
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:08,140
by the listeners. The monitor is from Dan's mom. It's okay when Dan's grandmom got a new

1917
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:13,760
computer we took the monitor. So that's one of our spare monitors. So it's just a simple

1918
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:18,580
flat screen monitor and the computer was donated by the listeners which was an awesome gesture.

1919
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:23,020
That was when I had the DevaFit one episode and I stormed off the set because what had

1920
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:27,380
happened? I think the show just kind of died in the middle like we were having the computer

1921
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:32,100
didn't the sound card? Sound card went out and wrapped in the middle of the show. I think

1922
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:36,780
the graphic card went out too. And then somebody in chat just you know sometimes and they you

1923
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:41,040
know and the person apologized to me afterwards so I don't mean to like dig up this four year

1924
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:45,220
old drama but it was you know just unfortunately say the wrong thing at the wrong moment and

1925
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:53,060
I just fucking lost it. And you know it was a moment when Travis called me the next day

1926
02:45:53,060 --> 02:45:59,120
to go that was the best thing that has ever happened on OLR. And Travis doesn't say nice

1927
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:05,380
things about OLR very often. But he called me to say Rob that was the best thing you

1928
02:46:05,380 --> 02:46:11,880
ever did on OLR. But the listeners after hearing that actually pulled together and bought a

1929
02:46:11,880 --> 02:46:17,920
new computer and we use it to this day. I was in studio Dark Sakura when the show computer

1930
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:21,940
before this one it was going to be my I think my second or third guest appearance on OLR

1931
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:30,100
was when we had just started dating where the old show computer died. It went to put

1932
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:35,540
old show. That's the that's the one that the fans put together for you. It was the old

1933
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:41,180
big one. Oh in this in the garage studio. No no no. It was that it was it. No we we've

1934
02:46:41,180 --> 02:46:45,780
had this one since then. It must be something most of the laptop. This this one. This was

1935
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:50,660
the computer that we got at my house. Right. Then we had the blue one the white and blue

1936
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:56,220
one that was a fan donation. No no no. That was my donation. That was yours. That's right.

1937
02:46:56,220 --> 02:47:00,300
But that's the one that crapped out on that show. Yeah. That caused me to lose it. No

1938
02:47:00,300 --> 02:47:04,300
because it was five thirty and you were firing up the computer and getting everything ready

1939
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:09,860
and it just it would it died. It stopped. Oh yeah. Something happened right before we

1940
02:47:09,860 --> 02:47:14,180
got it. No that was we were able to fix it. We were able to fix it. Something it was something

1941
02:47:14,180 --> 02:47:17,660
we found out later on was like a setting or something was screwed up but we were able

1942
02:47:17,660 --> 02:47:23,640
to fix it. But it just screwed the show that night. So. And yeah and also the this sound

1943
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:28,340
board that you guys have just goes into the line in on your sound card and then you guys

1944
02:47:28,340 --> 02:47:34,300
use what audition for the yeah we use audition for the for the podcasting itself. Yeah. Yeah.

1945
02:47:34,300 --> 02:47:38,140
The mixing board goes into the computer through the line in and then it's all recorded straight

1946
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:43,160
in Adobe Audition. I'll tell you the secret that a lot of people kind of wonder about

1947
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:48,520
is that how do we have the Skype and the music and everything all through the same sound

1948
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:52,440
like we you know it's sometimes it's kind of hard to do. You have to have a really nice

1949
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:56,540
sound card just get a nice sound card and we have a sound blaster card has to be capable

1950
02:47:56,540 --> 02:48:02,220
of what you hear. Yes you need something that's called what you with the letter U here and

1951
02:48:02,220 --> 02:48:06,780
the what you hear component on the sound card is what allows us to do Skype calls without

1952
02:48:06,780 --> 02:48:13,700
call graph do you know just have everything plug into the external mixer. My old laptop

1953
02:48:13,700 --> 02:48:20,220
had the capability except for that card it was actually listed as speaker output. So

1954
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:24,300
so yeah well different sound cards anything that came in you want to have it set to anything

1955
02:48:24,300 --> 02:48:28,480
that's going to come out of the speaker. I think somebody explained it to me as you want

1956
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:32,860
a full duplex card and not a half duplex card because full duplex is what's capable in and

1957
02:48:32,860 --> 02:48:37,140
out at the same time. Yes that's very important to spend if you're going to do podcast your

1958
02:48:37,140 --> 02:48:40,740
computer spend the extra money to get a nicer sound card and you'll be set. My nice awesome

1959
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:45,500
quad core computer doesn't have a sound card that does that but my old crappy laptop does.

1960
02:48:45,500 --> 02:48:52,980
Yeah weird. So in the chat dark Tetsuya says oh I think he had that clip on under station

1961
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:58,620
live not too long after there's a clip. Oh Lord. Well I got it probably was all recorded

1962
02:48:58,620 --> 02:49:03,020
on Justin T.V. because we were or did Justin T.V. go out when the rest of it went out.

1963
02:49:03,020 --> 02:49:08,000
I remember we were using Justin T.V. I don't remember. I will because we were in the garage

1964
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:13,940
studio when that happened. Yeah I think Justin T.V. was out but I don't remember. It was

1965
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:20,020
so long ago now I'm sure that clip will show up soon enough though. And Rama says it sound

1966
02:49:20,020 --> 02:49:23,900
blaster autogy or better. That's what you're going to want out of a card. Anyway that's

1967
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:28,700
my very long winded memory lane answer to that short question. Well we have one last

1968
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:37,780
email. And actually it's from well I didn't I'm just gonna say from Nigel. Here's an article

1969
02:49:37,780 --> 02:49:41,900
from the Guardian UK national newspaper. I read the Guardian all the time. So yeah that

1970
02:49:41,900 --> 02:49:49,100
might interest one dark Sakura. And here it is playing video games makes me sick is what

1971
02:49:49,100 --> 02:49:59,020
it's called. And from I scammed it over and I'll go ahead and read this bit of the paragraph.

1972
02:49:59,020 --> 02:50:05,020
You know and he's talking about playing Modern Warfare 3. This is he says I'm insanely jealous

1973
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:08,460
because I can't play it. This isn't because I haven't got a necessary game console or

1974
02:50:08,460 --> 02:50:12,580
don't like shooting people. I have and I do. After a mere 30 minutes of playing them I

1975
02:50:12,580 --> 02:50:17,140
have to run to the bathroom to throw up. I'm not alone either. Where there is little research

1976
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:22,020
into video games and what has been called simulation sickness estimates suggest that

1977
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:26,880
between 10 percent and 50 percent of people may suffer to various degrees. For me it was

1978
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:33,140
triggered from the first time I played such a game the PlayStation classic Doom in 1995.

1979
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:38,540
And for me the pixel games don't do it to me that badly. You know like Doom. But if

1980
02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:48,220
you the worst game that ever did it to me was Goldeneye on Nintendo 64. That game would

1981
02:50:48,220 --> 02:50:53,980
make me so sick. I couldn't watch because Dan was playing through it at the time and

1982
02:50:53,980 --> 02:51:00,200
he loves that game and I wanted to love it. I really did. Nope sick. I couldn't play unreal.

1983
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:06,620
I couldn't play the newer quakes because anything that was actually 3D would make me sick. Katamari

1984
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:12,660
made me super sick. Portal makes me way sick because it doesn't have that fast reorientation

1985
02:51:12,660 --> 02:51:18,480
the way that Portal 2 does. So Portal 2 made me sick at first but I could get used to it.

1986
02:51:18,480 --> 02:51:22,240
And now I can play it with no problem. I mean I do have to stop every few levels and let

1987
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:26,580
my eyes readjust. But I can't play the first Portal for very long at all because it will

1988
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:31,180
make me very nauseous. Technically you're supposed to do that with any game anyway every

1989
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:35,000
you know 30 minutes or so. How many people do that Rob? Well I'm just saying you're supposed

1990
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:38,940
to and there's a reason. Well I'm usually also multitasking. I'm talking to people while

1991
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:46,780
I'm playing Portal. So. But yeah. But basically it's just. Here's another thing. It says the

1992
02:51:46,780 --> 02:51:51,260
US Army Research Institute for Behavioral Social Science also studied flight simulators

1993
02:51:51,260 --> 02:51:55,820
and found that slightly fewer than half of pilots using them reported symptoms similar

1994
02:51:55,820 --> 02:52:01,500
to motion sickness. So this is actually super cool and I would also. In fact I'm gonna link

1995
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:07,780
this in the chat room as well because I think that other people will benefit from this.

1996
02:52:07,780 --> 02:52:14,660
Spazinator you can shut the fuck up. Spazinator by the way said want to play some Goldeneye.

1997
02:52:14,660 --> 02:52:18,780
But to be fair he did put colon P which means he isn't serious. I know. All right. And I

1998
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:26,020
wasn't serious although. But yeah I just would get so sick. And I get a little motion sick

1999
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:35,180
in a car if I'm not driving. But yeah. All right. That it for emails. You know what.

2000
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:43,180
I do not complain every other second. So AGN 728. Bite me. Bite me. That's not a complaint.

2001
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:46,460
That's a command. You should complain about the fact that they can't be bothered to change

2002
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:55,100
your nickname. Yeah. All right. Moving on. I wonder if that's for Angry Gaming Nerd maybe.

2003
02:52:55,100 --> 02:52:58,940
But no it's somebody that's coming from all games radio all games network. They're in

2004
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:03,260
the all games chat as opposed to the chat that orange on radio. You didn't have to kick

2005
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:08,580
him. What you kick him for. I can handle my own back. I'm a grown woman. I can fight my

2006
02:53:08,580 --> 02:53:13,780
own battles. Now look at that. Despite all that she's got your back. Despite all that

2007
02:53:13,780 --> 02:53:18,340
she's done all that. You need to slap one with the trout right now to kick him myself.

2008
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:22,460
I mean no I'm kidding. I wouldn't have done that. I will. I'm a good girl. I will slap

2009
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:27,980
Rama with the trout for you. Thank you. There you go. All right. We need to. We actually

2010
02:53:27,980 --> 02:53:32,780
I wish we could change that to like with large boobs or something. All right. Moving on.

2011
02:53:32,780 --> 02:53:39,900
OK. We've got to move on. The week. Oh speaking of complaints. What a perfect time for us

2012
02:53:39,900 --> 02:54:04,300
to do our normal segment of the. Um really my my complaint. Fuck you to moving because

2013
02:54:04,300 --> 02:54:10,940
moving is awful. I mean I like being in the new house that isn't falling apart like my

2014
02:54:10,940 --> 02:54:20,100
old house was. I hate paying rent now but I really like being in the new place and it's

2015
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:24,780
just the soreness and the pain that comes with all the moving and not really just the

2016
02:54:24,780 --> 02:54:30,060
physical stuff but the emotional side of it too because I mean Dan and I lived at that

2017
02:54:30,060 --> 02:54:35,980
old house. We got married living in that old house. We had lots of wonderful fights in

2018
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:43,100
that old house. We've done lots of other things in that house. Sure. He's pooped on it. You

2019
02:54:43,100 --> 02:54:46,740
know how many. Sure. He hasn't pooped on this house yet. Prayed in that house is what you

2020
02:54:46,740 --> 02:54:58,540
meant to say. Yeah. Rob I've prayed. I prayed a lot. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. No. But I mean

2021
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:03,140
there and on top of that that house before you know we rented from our friends and they

2022
02:55:03,140 --> 02:55:07,380
got married in the backyard of that house. Oh wow. So I mean we have lots of memories

2023
02:55:07,380 --> 02:55:14,260
of going over there to visit our friends too. You know a decade of memories of that house.

2024
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:18,540
So you know we're going to miss our neighbors. We told them where we love those. We literally

2025
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:24,620
moved three blocks away. But I have to add a thank you to Dan for this morning when he

2026
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:30,140
kind of woke me up when he was about to leave. He said you don't have to do anything today.

2027
02:55:30,140 --> 02:55:37,460
You have my full blessing to stay in bed all day or play well all day if you want to. You

2028
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:43,940
I will not expect a single tour out of you. So I got up and did the dishes. No I did the

2029
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:48,700
dishes when I got up because I just wanted my coffee cup. Chiggers and chat says that

2030
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:53,620
would suck moving all those pinball machines. Well Dan did all that. So we have we have

2031
02:55:53,620 --> 02:56:00,220
this kind of Jack thing. It's got a big flat metal platform on top and you put it under

2032
02:56:00,220 --> 02:56:07,340
the table and you jack it up like a car jack. He had the jacket. But you can it lifts the

2033
02:56:07,340 --> 02:56:11,700
whole table up so that you can move it on this wheeled object so that in and of itself

2034
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:17,500
isn't isn't very heavy and you can raise it to the level of a truck and slide it in. Wow.

2035
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:22,220
So that's the science that the refrigerator was harder to move because we had to take

2036
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:25,700
the doors off the house and the doors off the refrigerator to get the damn thing in.

2037
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:34,700
All right. We got to move on with the. OK. All right. Alan. Oh boy. It's a new year.

2038
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:41,620
It's when people set arbitrary expectations on life changes you know resolutions and I'm

2039
02:56:41,620 --> 02:56:46,220
like really fat right now. So if you've been really out of shape and waiting the most I've

2040
02:56:46,220 --> 02:56:55,380
ever waited my life. I blame happiness. It's relationship weight. Yeah I'm so miserable.

2041
02:56:55,380 --> 02:57:00,860
No speak being unemployed and you know it's apparently done wonders for my appetite that

2042
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:06,980
I don't need. So I just need to lose weight. That happened though when I first moved out

2043
02:57:06,980 --> 02:57:12,420
here and moved in with Dan. I went from a size 12 which I don't care I've always had

2044
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:21,300
some but to me to a 24. So I think Rob's accurate. I mean it happens when you're not working

2045
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:28,500
relationship with a lot of stuff involved. And you're certainly not a size 24 anymore.

2046
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:36,860
No I lost 60 pounds. Yeah. All right. So and when I was helping do like volunteer crew

2047
02:57:36,860 --> 02:57:43,060
for room loud the rock band fundraiser. It's fine now but for like a day or two after for

2048
02:57:43,060 --> 02:57:47,460
a good two weeks my right knee was hurting because I guess I picked something up wrong

2049
02:57:47,460 --> 02:57:52,100
better than my back which is injured. But it's OK now. And it's like I mean you're getting

2050
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:57,860
old with stuff up means you're out of shape and you know getting old. So just being out

2051
02:57:57,860 --> 02:58:04,380
of shape and overweight. My view of the week. I don't know I don't really have a lot because

2052
02:58:04,380 --> 02:58:08,980
shit I'm on vacation right now and I I have an extra week off. I don't have to go back

2053
02:58:08,980 --> 02:58:13,460
tomorrow like most people do. So and I'm going to Disneyland. Shit life's pretty fucking

2054
02:58:13,460 --> 02:58:18,500
good right now. So if you do the fact that it all has to end sometime if you're not taking

2055
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:27,940
me. Well if you do you for for not being taken. I don't know. All right. Heart heart heart.

2056
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:31,020
That's it. That's it for the if he's the week. All right. Just a couple more stories for

2057
02:58:31,020 --> 02:58:34,460
you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line and take your Twitter topics. I

2058
02:58:34,460 --> 02:58:37,940
don't think we have a lot of Twitter Twitter topics yet but we'll see Twitter dot com slash

2059
02:58:37,940 --> 02:58:44,820
O L R. But first just a couple quick stories for you guys. Alan. Team meet to make the

2060
02:58:44,820 --> 02:58:51,180
amazing sort of God. I know right. So you see act deaf in chat. Yeah. That you took

2061
02:58:51,180 --> 02:58:58,080
an arrow to the knee. Yes. And I have I have a sneeze on deck so I'm going to try and burn

2062
02:58:58,080 --> 02:59:02,760
through this story. Team meet released a game called the Binding of Isaac and it's the same

2063
02:59:02,760 --> 02:59:10,140
art as Super Meat Boy which is a great retro game that made a lot of top 10 lists for this

2064
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:15,740
year. The Binding of Isaac it's currently available on PC via steam. They're in talks

2065
02:59:15,740 --> 02:59:23,180
to bring it to the 3DS via their 3DS app store. And you were just playing VVVVV on the 3DS

2066
02:59:23,180 --> 02:59:27,860
different developer but it's still a steam indie game now available on a handheld. And

2067
02:59:27,860 --> 02:59:33,020
so yeah. Team Meat is trying to bring the Binding of Isaac which I guess is a roguelike

2068
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:40,660
dungeon crawler game has some biblical story points to it. And apparently it's really awesome

2069
02:59:40,660 --> 02:59:44,620
kind of gross. But Super Meat Boy was kind of gross too has the same art style. Look

2070
02:59:44,620 --> 02:59:50,020
for it on the 3DS. Maybe they're in talks and that is interesting. Very interesting.

2071
02:59:50,020 --> 02:59:52,540
I kind of like where that's going if a lot of those indie games are suddenly going to

2072
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:57,820
show up on 3DS. They wanted to bring Super Meat Boy to the Wii but the limitations on

2073
02:59:57,820 --> 03:00:03,700
the patching and how big I think the max file size could be. They couldn't do it so the

2074
03:00:03,700 --> 03:00:07,300
fact that they're still talking to Nintendo trying to get their next game after Super

2075
03:00:07,300 --> 03:00:18,500
Meat Boy 2 the 3DS is a great sign. Awesome. Yeah. Alright. And lastly tonight a story

2076
03:00:18,500 --> 03:00:24,180
that is kind of one of those things you sort of saw coming. Online passes it's all the

2077
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:28,740
rage in the industry right? It's happening on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. If you want

2078
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:32,580
to play a game online and you didn't buy it new you're going to have to buy an extra

2079
03:00:32,580 --> 03:00:37,300
little pass. Well guess what? It's coming to the Playstation Vita as well. Yes it was

2080
03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:43,660
confirmed that Hot Shots Golf World Invitational it requires an online pass. New copies have

2081
03:00:43,660 --> 03:00:47,660
a code that comes with it but an online pass is purchased through the Playstation Network

2082
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:52,560
if you have a used or a downloaded copy. Now this was amended later on because I guess

2083
03:00:52,560 --> 03:00:56,300
at first they were like oh shit if you download it you have to get the online pass as well

2084
03:00:56,300 --> 03:01:01,540
but it actually was updated to say that hold on the online pass is actually already included

2085
03:01:01,540 --> 03:01:05,780
when you download it on Playstation Network so you don't have to download it separately

2086
03:01:05,780 --> 03:01:12,540
just to be fair. So the online passes though they are going over to the PS Vita. Now the

2087
03:01:12,540 --> 03:01:20,680
online pass will cost 900 yen for Hot Shots Golf that's about $11.50 US so you can expect

2088
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:30,180
$10 probably to be about the same price here in the US. So well I guess it's probably not

2089
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:36,820
surprising to hear right? Yeah alright. Let's go to the phones. We're going to open up the

2090
03:01:36,820 --> 03:01:42,740
phones right now. I'm sorry I was doing my hair. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype

2091
03:01:42,740 --> 03:01:47,100
is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to go to the Twitter topics real quick and read some

2092
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:51,900
of the stories and things you guys want to talk about. Not a whole lot of feedback this

2093
03:01:51,900 --> 03:01:58,740
week. Didn't get a lot through the week probably because of the holidays but let's see. Redertainment

2094
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:04,180
tweeted us saying voting is live for the 4th annual the 4 star awards. Well I don't know

2095
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:09,540
what is that? Is that like your own personal? What is the 4 star awards? I don't know. And

2096
03:02:09,540 --> 03:02:16,340
we're not nominated. Granted there's no podcast category but we should be nominated for movie

2097
03:02:16,340 --> 03:02:26,100
of the year. Whatever it's on Facebook if you want to check it out. Alright. We'll pimp

2098
03:02:26,100 --> 03:02:32,180
out any awards show what the hell. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2099
03:02:32,180 --> 03:02:35,940
Tigerclaw sent us a couple quick tweets here. I read about one of these earlier. He sent

2100
03:02:35,940 --> 03:02:40,580
us a tweet about dude turned swap note into an RPG. I have to admit I didn't pick this

2101
03:02:40,580 --> 03:02:45,620
story for tonight because I wasn't sure how to explain it. It's a YouTube it's 9 minutes

2102
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:49,100
long so I'm not going to play the entire YouTube for you guys but some guy if you don't know

2103
03:02:49,100 --> 03:02:55,240
what swap note is it came out on the 3DS this week. It's a system that lets you basically

2104
03:02:55,240 --> 03:03:00,060
exchange emails except instead of written emails they're little actual written handwritten

2105
03:03:00,060 --> 03:03:03,820
notes that you can send to other people but as you use swap note more you can start to

2106
03:03:03,820 --> 03:03:08,500
send 5 second messages or pictures. I actually sent to all the people on my friends list

2107
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:13,780
on 3DS I sent a picture of Maruko one of the cats here and sent it out. So you know it's

2108
03:03:13,780 --> 03:03:17,340
kind of like a fun way to share things. It's like oh wow Nintendo is actually embracing

2109
03:03:17,340 --> 03:03:21,720
the internet for something. Well somebody actually turned it into a full fledged RPG

2110
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:25,460
in the vein of Dungeons and Dragons. And I guess there's even like a Dungeon Master template

2111
03:03:25,460 --> 03:03:29,660
you can use and he talks about all this in his YouTube on how he did it. Again it's a

2112
03:03:29,660 --> 03:03:34,740
little long for me to play here but it's MNC Dover is the username on YouTube if you want

2113
03:03:34,740 --> 03:03:41,400
to look that up for yourself. Alright and one other tweet here from Tigerclaw. Epic

2114
03:03:41,400 --> 03:03:49,620
Games scores a victory against Silicon Knights in a Two Human suit. And I don't even remember

2115
03:03:49,620 --> 03:03:52,620
what this suit was all about so I'm loading the story now. He's linked us to a story at

2116
03:03:52,620 --> 03:04:00,300
the multiplayer blog at MTV.com. And let's see. Two Human was supposed to be the start

2117
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:04,480
of the next great expansive RPG franchise and reasons that gamers will want in Xbox

2118
03:04:04,480 --> 03:04:09,980
360 back in the early days. The Silicon Knights developed game was supposed to be a big deal

2119
03:04:09,980 --> 03:04:14,980
but the game was delayed for two years. The critical response to the game was less enthusiastic

2120
03:04:14,980 --> 03:04:19,900
and what was intended to be a trilogy was Dead on Arrival with just 130,000 units sold

2121
03:04:19,900 --> 03:04:25,260
and Microsoft ending their agreement with Silicon Knights. I guess Silicon sued Epic

2122
03:04:25,260 --> 03:04:31,060
Games over Two Human saying that Epic misrepresented the functionality of the Unreal Engine which

2123
03:04:31,060 --> 03:04:36,980
was used for Two Human resulting in the two year delay. Wow interesting. Well the case

2124
03:04:36,980 --> 03:04:42,540
against Epic Games took a blow because one of the key witnesses was excluded from giving

2125
03:04:42,540 --> 03:04:48,060
testimony after a ruling by Judge James Denver the third. The testimony was going to break

2126
03:04:48,060 --> 03:04:53,420
it down into dollars and cents terms what the negative impact of working with the Unreal

2127
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:58,040
Engine was supposed to have on Silicon Knights but the testimony was found to be questionable

2128
03:04:58,040 --> 03:05:02,420
and that the methods did not fit the facts of the case. Interesting. I didn't realize

2129
03:05:02,420 --> 03:05:05,820
there was all this drama going on. Of course this was a game that wasn't on my radar and

2130
03:05:05,820 --> 03:05:08,820
maybe the fact that it wasn't on my radars you know part of the reason why I didn't sell

2131
03:05:08,820 --> 03:05:13,900
so good but there you go. Alright anyhow let's go to the phones and take some calls. Hi you're

2132
03:05:13,900 --> 03:05:23,020
on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Oh hey you don't sound so good try again. Who's this?

2133
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:29,580
Is it just me that doesn't hear that at all? It's really. You sound like a Dalek. I can't.

2134
03:05:29,580 --> 03:05:33,940
I'm hoping oh god I hope that's it was Zaku obviously that was calling in he might have

2135
03:05:33,940 --> 03:05:38,420
been able to make that out but I can't I couldn't understand him at all. No neither could I.

2136
03:05:38,420 --> 03:05:41,820
Now was that his connection or was that ours? See now all these things I'm going to question

2137
03:05:41,820 --> 03:05:48,480
is that the new studio set up so let me just see real quick here. Real quick here. Hello

2138
03:05:48,480 --> 03:05:52,860
welcome to Skype call testing service. See that works fine. Hello British lady. Hello

2139
03:05:52,860 --> 03:05:56,140
British lady. Let's see if maybe this next call sounds a little cleaner. Hi you're on

2140
03:05:56,140 --> 03:06:02,660
Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hello Derek H. Hi Derek H. See I can understand Derek

2141
03:06:02,660 --> 03:06:08,860
just fine. Our last call was a little weird. Alright anyhow Derek what's on your mind buddy?

2142
03:06:08,860 --> 03:06:13,660
I would like to talk about video games I've called you guys too. There's this thing called

2143
03:06:13,660 --> 03:06:17,500
Steam I don't know if you've heard of it that they have like a. Oh a friend was telling

2144
03:06:17,500 --> 03:06:22,220
me about Steam. We don't play games. I play board games. We sure eat a lot of food though.

2145
03:06:22,220 --> 03:06:27,740
Would you like to play some Risk or maybe Axis and Allies? I was thinking more about

2146
03:06:27,740 --> 03:06:36,460
Wits and Wagers maybe. So Steam yes yes I've heard of Steam. I've had Steam for a long

2147
03:06:36,460 --> 03:06:45,820
time and I only buy games when they're like. Whoa whoa whoa Derek you cut out if you can

2148
03:06:45,820 --> 03:06:53,060
hear me you like totally cut out. It sounds like what the hell's going on? It's like the

2149
03:06:53,060 --> 03:07:04,700
void of calls. Your voice like dropped out so did your mic come unplugged or something?

2150
03:07:04,700 --> 03:07:08,100
Hello trying Derek again one two three. I see that we're still connected it's not an

2151
03:07:08,100 --> 03:07:13,500
internet thing but he just the voice dropped out. I don't even know if he can hear us.

2152
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:19,340
He hung up. That's a bummer. I don't even know what he was about to say about Steam

2153
03:07:19,340 --> 03:07:23,180
but I think it was like I only buy games when and I'm thinking it was maybe when they're

2154
03:07:23,180 --> 03:07:27,960
on sale. Yeah dirt cheap maybe. Maybe it was going to lead to a question about is that

2155
03:07:27,960 --> 03:07:31,740
bad that for the industry? I don't know let's see. I just want to make sure here real quick

2156
03:07:31,740 --> 03:07:38,220
let's just let's just maybe this studio is a bad omen for calls. Let's see. Hello welcome

2157
03:07:38,220 --> 03:07:43,380
to Skype call testing service. She works fine. After the beep please record a message. Afterwards

2158
03:07:43,380 --> 03:07:48,860
your message will be played back to you. Hi I'm doing really professional internet radio

2159
03:07:48,860 --> 03:07:56,360
right now and I am testing a Skype connection live. I love you British lady. On the air.

2160
03:07:56,360 --> 03:08:01,100
This is all dark soccer's fault. Hi I'm doing really professional internet radio right now

2161
03:08:01,100 --> 03:08:11,340
and I am. See it's fine. What's up. You know what's up is this delicious stew. It's amazing.

2162
03:08:11,340 --> 03:08:16,140
Thank you so much. Pop is just put in front of my mouth begging me to eat. What is what

2163
03:08:16,140 --> 03:08:25,240
did you make here. It's just stew cubed stew beef small red potatoes carrots and I actually

2164
03:08:25,240 --> 03:08:30,500
cut up two blood oranges and threw them in there and I can taste this I can taste it

2165
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:37,140
too. Yeah I used a peeler to get the rind the orange zest. All right. So it's it's Orange

2166
03:08:37,140 --> 03:08:47,860
Lounge do do. Oh my God we're breaking up. I've had that in my head like all night. All

2167
03:08:47,860 --> 03:08:53,260
right let's move on to another call. Maybe this one will work. Hi you're on orange already.

2168
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:57,940
Who's this. It's Shane. OK. So far we can hear you and you're not a robot. So that's

2169
03:08:57,940 --> 03:09:03,020
good. Hi Shane. Awesome. I'm not a robot. That's cool. What's on your mind Shane. I

2170
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:09,180
don't know. I was calling to see if your stuff would work. Pretty much. Well only the collar

2171
03:09:09,180 --> 03:09:16,340
appears to be broken this time. You need to come play with me on the Horde server. Oh

2172
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:20,480
but there's so much Star Wars going on right now. All right. You know what. Pooh on that.

2173
03:09:20,480 --> 03:09:23,980
Then let's talk Star Wars. Because you were just telling me earlier you do nothing but

2174
03:09:23,980 --> 03:09:28,560
play Star Wars now. Yeah it's really sad. I came on here and I said you know I like

2175
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:32,900
Star Wars and I don't like Star Wars for these particular reasons. So what are your

2176
03:09:32,900 --> 03:09:36,740
thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic. Well first of all I'd like to say I did not listen

2177
03:09:36,740 --> 03:09:40,380
to what you said about why you like it and why you do not. So I don't know if I'm going

2178
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:47,500
to copy you or anything but I like it because the story is really cool and I don't know

2179
03:09:47,500 --> 03:09:54,620
anything about Star Wars so this is all new to me. Like every single last thing. OK I'm

2180
03:09:54,620 --> 03:09:57,900
still there I hear like stuff in the background. Yeah we're just eating we're stuffing our

2181
03:09:57,900 --> 03:10:04,140
face while you're talking. Oh that's what I was eating long questions. That wasn't a

2182
03:10:04,140 --> 03:10:11,300
very long question. All right. I don't like it because it doesn't feel polished still

2183
03:10:11,300 --> 03:10:16,900
which is expected because it's such a new game. But you know that will come with time.

2184
03:10:16,900 --> 03:10:21,300
Wow wasn't that great at vanilla. I played it a little bit but I'm really digging it

2185
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:27,280
like there's plot twists and every single class so far has been really fun to play which

2186
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:32,180
I can't say the same for well but I do love well I'm in a year commitment with wow I have

2187
03:10:32,180 --> 03:10:35,860
like fully paid off with time card so I don't really care if I'm not playing it right now

2188
03:10:35,860 --> 03:10:42,140
so but I'm really enjoying Star Wars I just got a ship on one of my characters and it's

2189
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:59,780
pretty cool. I mean. So describe the glasses for us. Oh my God you pigs. OK. There's dinner.

2190
03:10:59,780 --> 03:11:03,260
Well that's what I was doing and then I thought I would call it help to make sure your Skype

2191
03:11:03,260 --> 03:11:08,060
was working. Why wait no no no hold on. I got another question for you. OK. OK. My question

2192
03:11:08,060 --> 03:11:12,940
is what is supposed to happen in the end game of Star Wars like I don't know because I can't

2193
03:11:12,940 --> 03:11:17,960
even figure out the non end game yet. Like there's no hand holding for the most part

2194
03:11:17,960 --> 03:11:23,260
except for at the very beginning. And so like I'm just kind of pretending I know what I'm

2195
03:11:23,260 --> 03:11:30,180
doing and it's not working out so well in some situations like some quests I kind of

2196
03:11:30,180 --> 03:11:36,780
suck at but oh well I haven't seen but like maybe two level 50 characters and their armors

2197
03:11:36,780 --> 03:11:42,460
ugly so I don't even care about endgame yet. I just want story. Something just occurred

2198
03:11:42,460 --> 03:11:49,260
to me. What. We're sitting at a table eating. I know right. I know. Who does that anymore.

2199
03:11:49,260 --> 03:11:55,360
So Shane have you had any problems with like leveling up crap like keeping your crafting

2200
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:59,180
up to level with what level you are and using the auction house because Rob I haven't played

2201
03:11:59,180 --> 03:12:03,740
myself but Rob was saying that he has trouble with how auction house works. The auction

2202
03:12:03,740 --> 03:12:08,000
house is pretty terrible auction house works like Final Fantasy 11 auction house in some

2203
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:13,280
ways not only it's like a hybrid between 11 and wow it's weird. I don't really like it

2204
03:12:13,280 --> 03:12:19,300
but the crafting funny enough I'm actually doing right now while I'm on this Skype stuff

2205
03:12:19,300 --> 03:12:27,260
because I was not paying attention to it because part of the crafting aspect is that your companions

2206
03:12:27,260 --> 03:12:32,920
do it and not you. So I have I now have two companions so I can kind of do two things

2207
03:12:32,920 --> 03:12:39,640
at once but my companion that's like you know I can run around the world with and do stuff

2208
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:44,300
with and fight is my tank and I'm a healer so I kind of need him to not craft because

2209
03:12:44,300 --> 03:12:51,620
he goes away when he crafts. So I'm just I'm leveling up the little thing that makes lightsaber

2210
03:12:51,620 --> 03:12:58,820
crystals right now because it's really really far behind. I like it. I don't have characters

2211
03:12:58,820 --> 03:13:05,260
later and do flash points. What was that? Sorry I'm eating a potato. Are we gonna get

2212
03:13:05,260 --> 03:13:11,140
on later and do flash points? Yeah. Or just regular quests because we can only do one

2213
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:17,020
flash point until like 16 or 14 I forget. I thought you loved the flash points so much

2214
03:13:17,020 --> 03:13:20,620
in Star Wars though. Why do you love flash points so much that's a good question to ask.

2215
03:13:20,620 --> 03:13:27,220
Let me let me let me clarify that now because I've run a total of three. I like the starter

2216
03:13:27,220 --> 03:13:35,060
flash points for both sides now. It's neat because you can completely change the outcome

2217
03:13:35,060 --> 03:13:40,260
of that flash point story based on dialogue options. So all my characters for the most

2218
03:13:40,260 --> 03:13:47,180
part are light side even though they might be Imperial or Republic. So like I save the

2219
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:51,660
captain from being killed. I save this general from being killed. I take this chick with

2220
03:13:51,660 --> 03:13:59,060
me that the commander wants killed. So if my choice gets picked out of the random roles

2221
03:13:59,060 --> 03:14:04,380
it affects the rest of the story for everybody for that specific flash point. So that's really

2222
03:14:04,380 --> 03:14:10,740
neat to me and they don't feel that long even though I think they're like an hour long each.

2223
03:14:10,740 --> 03:14:20,380
But I did just yesterday run a second flash point on my one of my characters I don't remember

2224
03:14:20,380 --> 03:14:27,460
who and it was very dull because it was all brown. It was like playing Gears of War or

2225
03:14:27,460 --> 03:14:33,380
any other FPS that's come out in the last couple years. Why do you say that just because

2226
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:40,140
it graphically didn't look good? It's because there was just it was all the same color palette

2227
03:14:40,140 --> 03:14:44,620
and it was boring and I didn't even see all the story. See you only like pretty things.

2228
03:14:44,620 --> 03:14:50,060
I what? You only like pretty things. Yeah. Oh okay as long as we're clear. Normal person

2229
03:14:50,060 --> 03:14:55,460
would want something ugly. I don't know. That's why there's so many orphans. I ask myself

2230
03:14:55,460 --> 03:15:06,860
a lot. Wow. I was gonna say I ask myself that a lot when I cry to myself to sleep at night.

2231
03:15:06,860 --> 03:15:12,260
All right. Anyhow I should probably let you go soon so we can get other calls hopefully

2232
03:15:12,260 --> 03:15:17,380
but do you have any other closing thoughts for us tonight Shane? I was going to participate

2233
03:15:17,380 --> 03:15:22,020
in that top three games of the year thing on Facebook and then I got lazy and didn't

2234
03:15:22,020 --> 03:15:27,020
type anything out. But Portal 2 would have been my number one as well after thinking

2235
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:30,660
about every single game that came out this year. Nothing else. I didn't sit through any

2236
03:15:30,660 --> 03:15:35,220
other game from start to finish this year except for Portal. I think what I should have

2237
03:15:35,220 --> 03:15:40,540
done is a top three most disappointing games of the year because there were a lot of hyped

2238
03:15:40,540 --> 03:15:47,740
games that did not meet expectations. My number one would piss people off. My top three would

2239
03:15:47,740 --> 03:15:52,420
probably make lots of people angry. Well you can make people angry because they can't send

2240
03:15:52,420 --> 03:15:57,460
hate mail to you. So what's your top three most disappointing? I wouldn't put them in

2241
03:15:57,460 --> 03:16:03,940
any sort of order because they were all very disappointing. I would say Dragon Age 2 because

2242
03:16:03,940 --> 03:16:11,780
it just wasn't that good. I would also say Uncharted 3 because 2 was so good and Uncharted

2243
03:16:11,780 --> 03:16:18,220
3 kind of dropped the ball. And then I would say Marvel vs Capcom 3. It's just not fun.

2244
03:16:18,220 --> 03:16:23,940
I even have Ultimate and I like playing Phoenix Wright but it's still not a fun game. Dark

2245
03:16:23,940 --> 03:16:34,620
Sakura? You said you like Strider, right? No, I like Phoenix Wright. Oh Phoenix Wright?

2246
03:16:34,620 --> 03:16:43,220
Well he can be wrong. You can choke on a potato too. I agree with Dragon Age 2. I believe

2247
03:16:43,220 --> 03:16:49,380
I've picked up every NPC that I can, I think. I just got off the mountain where Flemeth

2248
03:16:49,380 --> 03:16:55,100
is there and you do the thing where Flemeth comes back. I don't care about the side characters

2249
03:16:55,100 --> 03:17:02,140
like I did in Origins. Yeah, the story's just not as good. The combat's more fun. I own

2250
03:17:02,140 --> 03:17:06,420
it on PC and PS3. That's how much I cared about Dragon Age 1. I was like, oh I love

2251
03:17:06,420 --> 03:17:11,700
2, it's gonna be awesome. No. Yeah, I'm gonna beat it simply because I'm committed to the

2252
03:17:11,700 --> 03:17:17,100
world that they've built but the writing isn't as good. No. Alright. Shane, I gotta let you

2253
03:17:17,100 --> 03:17:22,340
go so we can get more calls. That's cool. Okay? I do. Alright, bye. Alright, we're gonna

2254
03:17:22,340 --> 03:17:28,460
go to some more calls. Hooray! Let's try this again. Hi, on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's

2255
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:33,180
this? Hello, it's Derek H from Fardini Beach. Nice to hear from you again. I don't know

2256
03:17:33,180 --> 03:17:38,220
what happened before. It's a weird internet thing. I blame Skype. Well it's free so you

2257
03:17:38,220 --> 03:17:42,820
can't blame Skype but I still blame Skype. Alright, well you were talking about Steam

2258
03:17:42,820 --> 03:17:47,580
and you were about to say, you were talking about I only buy games on Steam when... They're

2259
03:17:47,580 --> 03:17:53,780
on sale and that is a huge mistake. I should only buy games on Steam. In fact, I'll say

2260
03:17:53,780 --> 03:17:57,620
this about everybody. Everybody should only buy games on Steam when they are full price

2261
03:17:57,620 --> 03:18:03,940
because then you know that you actually want that game because I have a, now after the

2262
03:18:03,940 --> 03:18:11,740
last week I have like 8 games I'm never gonna play again. I bought 2 games. I bought, I

2263
03:18:11,740 --> 03:18:17,660
looked and I said, oh wow, there's 2 flight sims for only $3 a piece and then I looked

2264
03:18:17,660 --> 03:18:24,300
and I have a flight stick that had fallen behind my desk like a year ago and I never

2265
03:18:24,300 --> 03:18:28,460
even bothered to reach it and so when I picked it up it had a layer of dust on it so I was

2266
03:18:28,460 --> 03:18:33,700
like, oh wait, I have a flight stick. I must like flight sims. So I bought those games,

2267
03:18:33,700 --> 03:18:37,660
played them for 20 minutes and realized I hate flight sims. Raise your hand if you've

2268
03:18:37,660 --> 03:18:43,740
been there. Earlier this year, I think it was the Thanksgiving sale, they had Dead Space

2269
03:18:43,740 --> 03:18:48,940
1 and 2 in a combo pack for like 4 or 5 bucks and I was like, alright, Dead Space, you know,

2270
03:18:48,940 --> 03:18:52,980
Resident Evil with aliens or ghosts in outer space, I'll buy that. I had already bought

2271
03:18:52,980 --> 03:18:58,140
it. Completely forgot that I had bought the rights to download that on my Steam. Same

2272
03:18:58,140 --> 03:19:02,660
with Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition. It's like, oh yeah, dirt cheap 3 bucks. I

2273
03:19:02,660 --> 03:19:05,820
get my credit card out. Oh yeah, you bought that 6 months ago but you forgot about it

2274
03:19:05,820 --> 03:19:10,060
instantly afterward. So I definitely have that problem.

2275
03:19:10,060 --> 03:19:15,620
I have Knights of the Old Republic on the Xbox version but you can play it on the 360.

2276
03:19:15,620 --> 03:19:20,780
I bought that like 2 years ago, actually like 4 years ago, a long time ago. I don't like

2277
03:19:20,780 --> 03:19:27,380
it. I'm one of the few people that cannot stand KOTOR and I saw it on Steam, it was

2278
03:19:27,380 --> 03:19:34,540
only $2.50. I actually, I struggled with myself not to buy it. Anyway, I own this game. I

2279
03:19:34,540 --> 03:19:40,460
don't like it but it's only $2.50. You posted on Facebook or Google or something about that

2280
03:19:40,460 --> 03:19:45,460
and I, cause I remember reading that. One of my friends worked on that game. Really?

2281
03:19:45,460 --> 03:19:51,400
You know what she called it? What? Scrotor. But hey, while she was working on it, we got

2282
03:19:51,400 --> 03:19:54,660
to go to the Skywalker Ranch. Oh, that's when you flung the meatball at George Lucas. No,

2283
03:19:54,660 --> 03:19:58,740
when I wanted to fling meatloaf at George Lucas. He walked by and I could have flung

2284
03:19:58,740 --> 03:20:02,300
meatloaf at him. I changed the story a little bit. I embellished. You know what, Derek,

2285
03:20:02,300 --> 03:20:07,500
I did something similar during this most recent Steam sale. I bought Quake Collection. I didn't

2286
03:20:07,500 --> 03:20:13,500
buy just one Quake game. I bought Quake 1, 2 and 3. Quake 2 isn't even that good. Quake

2287
03:20:13,500 --> 03:20:18,320
1 and 3 were good like 10 years ago but playing them now, like my video card doesn't know

2288
03:20:18,320 --> 03:20:22,980
how to handle Quake 3. Like I was having problems getting Quake 3 to even work. Why am I buying

2289
03:20:22,980 --> 03:20:28,780
Quake 3 when I can just go play Quake Live? I almost bought, when they had a thing where

2290
03:20:28,780 --> 03:20:35,540
you can buy all the Star Wars games or something for like $14, I was like, that's a great deal.

2291
03:20:35,540 --> 03:20:41,740
Even though I had no interest in buying these games when they came out or the years afterwards,

2292
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:47,840
all of a sudden I think I kind of need these games. But that's how they get people. This

2293
03:20:47,840 --> 03:20:51,660
happens in our culture all the time is that people want to see that they're getting a

2294
03:20:51,660 --> 03:20:55,460
good deal. Like for example, look at all the hilarity that happened on Black Friday. I'm

2295
03:20:55,460 --> 03:21:00,180
sure everybody here saw the video, Derek I'm assuming you probably saw this too, of the

2296
03:21:00,180 --> 03:21:04,620
people at Walmart that were practically jumping on top of each other and clawing each other's

2297
03:21:04,620 --> 03:21:11,460
eye outs over $2 waffle irons. And it's like, who really needs a waffle iron? How many days

2298
03:21:11,460 --> 03:21:17,900
out of the year do you make waffles at home? Yourself? You know? How many days last year

2299
03:21:17,900 --> 03:21:23,620
did you make waffles? Well, I have a friend that makes waffles. But not you. You. You.

2300
03:21:23,620 --> 03:21:29,620
You make waffles weekly? I. Would you trust a $2 waffle iron to make waffles? No. Exactly.

2301
03:21:29,620 --> 03:21:34,620
Unless it was a recognized brand and a Rudolph. But why do people want to kill each other

2302
03:21:34,620 --> 03:21:39,460
over a $2 waffle iron? Because it's $2. If you waff that much then you don't want waffles

2303
03:21:39,460 --> 03:21:48,520
from a $2 waffle iron. We won a waffle iron at a white elephant exchange and Alan actually

2304
03:21:48,520 --> 03:21:53,740
tried to make waffles with it and he got so frustrated he was cussing at this cheap white

2305
03:21:53,740 --> 03:22:01,240
elephant waffle maker that makes little circus animal waffles. But anyway, sorry I'm totally

2306
03:22:01,240 --> 03:22:05,420
going on a tangent, but you know what I mean, in our culture people want to get things just

2307
03:22:05,420 --> 03:22:09,900
because it's a good deal. Okay, so Becky just messaged me and said I make waffles at least

2308
03:22:09,900 --> 03:22:15,420
twice a month. But Becky is also a great cook. Yeah, and she has a really good waffle iron.

2309
03:22:15,420 --> 03:22:19,620
I wouldn't be surprised at all. She probably has a lot of great cooking things that most

2310
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:25,420
people don't have. So anyway, Alan you look like you're dying to say something over there.

2311
03:22:25,420 --> 03:22:32,780
There's, I'm too lazy to look it up, but there's actually a clinical term culturally for when

2312
03:22:32,780 --> 03:22:37,460
in times of financial hardship, like when the economy's in the shed or just when people

2313
03:22:37,460 --> 03:22:41,880
are broke, they'll go to the gas station when they fill up their car with a tank of gas

2314
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:45,940
and they'll buy a candy bar and they're not even hungry. But it's just an 89 cent thing

2315
03:22:45,940 --> 03:22:51,020
that makes them feel good that they bought this little thing that just makes them feel

2316
03:22:51,020 --> 03:22:58,220
better because it's cheap. And steam is a great outlet for that impulse that we have

2317
03:22:58,220 --> 03:23:04,100
where I need to buy something, I'm tired of being broke or this is only a dollar, so who

2318
03:23:04,100 --> 03:23:09,360
fucking cares? Retail therapy. Really, I mean, in the end.

2319
03:23:09,360 --> 03:23:15,980
So you're saying I bought Wings of Prey because I'm clinically depressed is what you're saying?

2320
03:23:15,980 --> 03:23:23,980
I don't think it's quite that. That maybe, I don't think we could make that conclusion

2321
03:23:23,980 --> 03:23:28,500
here on the show. No, but people are just driven if something

2322
03:23:28,500 --> 03:23:34,340
is cheap. It just, sometimes it feels good to spend a little bit of money on even if

2323
03:23:34,340 --> 03:23:39,180
it's something that you know that you ultimately won't. I know I do it all the time, but yeah,

2324
03:23:39,180 --> 03:23:42,300
if you make something cheap enough, people will buy it whether they want it or not.

2325
03:23:42,300 --> 03:23:48,940
Maybe it would be a good policy moving forward for people before you buy a steam game, you

2326
03:23:48,940 --> 03:23:54,900
need to walk away for an hour and then say after an hour, okay, do I still really want

2327
03:23:54,900 --> 03:23:57,340
that game? And if the answer is yes, then you buy it.

2328
03:23:57,340 --> 03:24:01,820
You can't do it because they have that countdown on the screen.

2329
03:24:01,820 --> 03:24:06,300
What if I only have 57 minutes? Why do you think I just bought Bastion at

2330
03:24:06,300 --> 03:24:09,420
the start of the show? And I even told you, I said, wait till you

2331
03:24:09,420 --> 03:24:19,500
get home, click done. All right, Derek, good luck with your steam.

2332
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:25,100
I don't want to say addiction, but your steam issues will say, and hey, at least I hope

2333
03:24:25,100 --> 03:24:28,980
you're getting to play some great games out of it, even if just for 20 minutes.

2334
03:24:28,980 --> 03:24:34,660
I'm going to go play VVV after the show. Hey, VVVV is awesome. Derek, quickly too,

2335
03:24:34,660 --> 03:24:39,500
since I was trying to pimp the big battle earlier, I want our listeners to understand

2336
03:24:39,500 --> 03:24:45,740
why should they sign up for the big battle? Oh, the big battle is a multi community gaming

2337
03:24:45,740 --> 03:24:51,820
tournament. You should do it because gaming is about having fun and you have more fun,

2338
03:24:51,820 --> 03:24:56,420
I believe, when you're competing and even more fun when you're competing for something

2339
03:24:56,420 --> 03:25:00,900
you enjoy. So basically you get to represent your favorite

2340
03:25:00,900 --> 03:25:08,180
like podcasts or whatever and say, hey, we're the best Mortal Kombat players. And it's not

2341
03:25:08,180 --> 03:25:11,700
even we're the best. It's like, you know, you know, it's not really, you're the best,

2342
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:15,740
but it's something you can hold up over somebody else's head. It's kind of nice. It's always

2343
03:25:15,740 --> 03:25:19,500
fun when you can, when you can compete against all your friends and also you get to meet

2344
03:25:19,500 --> 03:25:22,820
new people, you get to play against people. You probably wouldn't have, you've been playing,

2345
03:25:22,820 --> 03:25:26,020
you've been playing games against the same 20 people for the last four years. Now you

2346
03:25:26,020 --> 03:25:29,140
get to play against some other people who share the same interests as you. It's a good

2347
03:25:29,140 --> 03:25:32,420
thing. I think it's great. And, um, you know, I signed

2348
03:25:32,420 --> 03:25:35,420
up to play and I'm not signing up because I, I'm not going to win. Like, who are we

2349
03:25:35,420 --> 03:25:39,420
kidding here? I'll probably get knocked out the first round, but you know, I may not be

2350
03:25:39,420 --> 03:25:46,780
the best, but I can be the loudest. I think for the, for the Mortal Kombat ones,

2351
03:25:46,780 --> 03:25:51,980
the ringers are the guys from spooky hour horror hour who, who love not only horror

2352
03:25:51,980 --> 03:25:56,420
games, but like everything about horror. So they live and breathe Mortal Kombat. So I

2353
03:25:56,420 --> 03:26:00,420
think they're probably going to be the, the winners there. But you know what? It's good

2354
03:26:00,420 --> 03:26:05,340
to take the, like throw a knife in Tedikins throat every couple of days. That'd be fun.

2355
03:26:05,340 --> 03:26:10,180
That'd be fun. All right. Well, Derek, I gotta let you go. So we wrap up the show, but thank

2356
03:26:10,180 --> 03:26:13,980
you so much for the call. Thank you for doing a show so late tonight. All right. No problem.

2357
03:26:13,980 --> 03:26:18,300
Take care. Bye bye. I didn't realize that God, we were on so damn late. It's like nine

2358
03:26:18,300 --> 03:26:23,500
40 almost. We're usually done at no pink Berry. I know. Right. All right. So I think we might

2359
03:26:23,500 --> 03:26:26,780
need to shut down the Skype line and wrap the show up. I don't know why we're going

2360
03:26:26,780 --> 03:26:30,660
long tonight. I guess we just had a lot to say after a week off. I don't know what else

2361
03:26:30,660 --> 03:26:37,500
to tell you. All right. Um, we finished tweets last minute stories. Usually I turn to Loki

2362
03:26:37,500 --> 03:26:41,980
for that. He's not here. I, I anticipate Alan probably didn't dig anything up. I have one.

2363
03:26:41,980 --> 03:26:46,940
Okay. There's been a clarification about the final fantasy 10 HD remake that Squeenix announced

2364
03:26:46,940 --> 03:26:52,340
in September. Yeah. Um, I guess one of the developers or producers was asked for like

2365
03:26:52,340 --> 03:26:58,620
a timeline and he's like, it's just to make this clear, the final fantasy X remake isn't

2366
03:26:58,620 --> 03:27:06,140
just a texture cleanup and a up and a resolution upscaling. It is a remake. So wow. Redrawing

2367
03:27:06,140 --> 03:27:12,700
of 10. Oh, so redrawing of assets. We just cleaning up the script, new voiceover work.

2368
03:27:12,700 --> 03:27:17,980
It is the real deal. So what everybody wanted from final fantasy seven, 10 is getting 10

2369
03:27:17,980 --> 03:27:24,420
is getting. Yes. Did you just do seven? Well, how about do six? So people thought, how about,

2370
03:27:24,420 --> 03:27:28,620
how about let's really remake a game. Let's, let's take one like six or four. Well, four,

2371
03:27:28,620 --> 03:27:32,860
I guess got the DS from me or may have a remake, but six, six is begging for a really, really

2372
03:27:32,860 --> 03:27:39,020
awesome remake. So interesting. That just came out. Yeah. Stories dated today. Wow.

2373
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:42,580
Neat. Um, I guess the only other thing I could add is that there might be some of you wondering

2374
03:27:42,580 --> 03:27:46,140
why did we not talk about a certain scandal that was going on around the internet this

2375
03:27:46,140 --> 03:27:53,100
week, um, with this whole marketing company and, and the emails exchange and their device

2376
03:27:53,100 --> 03:27:57,780
and all that. There's two reasons. One, I think a lot of that stuff got really out of

2377
03:27:57,780 --> 03:28:05,460
control. Um, like, was it a slow news week or what? Um, and, uh, you know, I think a

2378
03:28:05,460 --> 03:28:11,060
lot of it's been discussed a lot and I don't know what else there is to add to that too.

2379
03:28:11,060 --> 03:28:15,620
I think Loki really wants to talk about it because he's actually used that controller

2380
03:28:15,620 --> 03:28:19,860
that's at the core of it. I think, although it's important to distinguish between the

2381
03:28:19,860 --> 03:28:25,740
individual that, you know, doesn't know how to deal with customers whatsoever and the

2382
03:28:25,740 --> 03:28:30,840
device itself, Loki has used the device itself and really wanted to comment on it. So I,

2383
03:28:30,840 --> 03:28:35,180
I'm kind of pushing that back to next week so we can discuss that a little more. So just

2384
03:28:35,180 --> 03:28:38,420
so you know, I just wanted to say yes, I'm aware that that happened in the gaming world

2385
03:28:38,420 --> 03:28:44,420
this week, but at the same time, I don't know, I might get shit for this, but whatever. I,

2386
03:28:44,420 --> 03:28:49,460
I kind of, it's not really gaming news. It's gaming community news and game community events

2387
03:28:49,460 --> 03:28:55,300
and I get why people are like following it. But I mean, it's just, it's just like horrible

2388
03:28:55,300 --> 03:29:01,020
train wreck, Ricky Lake holding her hand against the face with the jaw dropped, all that stuff.

2389
03:29:01,020 --> 03:29:07,620
So I can't believe you just made a Ricky Lake reference. Go Ricky, go Ricky. All right.

2390
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:11,980
I will say though, um, this is Derek had just called in dead pixel live, actually got the

2391
03:29:11,980 --> 03:29:18,060
guy on the show and from what I understand, he apologized. So at that token, you know,

2392
03:29:18,060 --> 03:29:22,800
what else is there to say if he's apologized? But you know, I also kind of think I feel

2393
03:29:22,800 --> 03:29:27,700
bad cause I have no idea what this is about. I'll find out next week or go listen to dead

2394
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:32,860
pixel live show from Thursday. It's, it's, it's interesting. The whole, the whole debacle

2395
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:38,100
is interesting, but at the same time I think had this happened in November when Skyrim

2396
03:29:38,100 --> 03:29:42,340
and all these things were coming out, it wouldn't have been as big of a, big of a thing. So

2397
03:29:42,340 --> 03:29:45,620
they did a good job covering it in a more timely manner since, you know, they were able

2398
03:29:45,620 --> 03:29:50,220
to get the guy on like the day after it happened. So I think, uh, I don't know what we could

2399
03:29:50,220 --> 03:29:54,780
contribute to that conversation. It's been five days. That's an eternity in internet

2400
03:29:54,780 --> 03:30:03,940
time. All right. Um, let's see. I think we're ready to wrap it up so we can't really wrap

2401
03:30:03,940 --> 03:30:08,060
it up and put a bow on it and call it done until everybody has given their final thoughts.

2402
03:30:08,060 --> 03:30:11,460
So, um, Alan, I'll start with you. Thank you very much as always for filling in for egg

2403
03:30:11,460 --> 03:30:15,940
host who is not here. Um, appreciate it. And um, you know, now that the show is in your

2404
03:30:15,940 --> 03:30:20,100
house, maybe you'll stop by once in a while and say hello or when Loki's here, I'll just

2405
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:24,920
play, you know, on the TV the whole time and ignore the show entirely. When we get the

2406
03:30:24,920 --> 03:30:28,500
video going, we can have you playing a game and you know, kind of talk about that and

2407
03:30:28,500 --> 03:30:37,060
we'll see. So, um, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight? Uh, no. Okay. Nothing

2408
03:30:37,060 --> 03:30:42,780
to plug. Nothing. All right. Fair enough. Uh, my final thought tonight is I haven't

2409
03:30:42,780 --> 03:30:47,380
had Hanson soda in a while, but now that I'm having this delicious black cherry soda, I've

2410
03:30:47,380 --> 03:30:51,900
kind of missed it. Dark soccer. Your final thought tonight? I love reading the stories

2411
03:30:51,900 --> 03:31:01,300
on unicorn booty.com. Nice. Oh, I have another final thought. Last night, New Year's Eve,

2412
03:31:01,300 --> 03:31:05,540
we watched a lot of adventure time. Is that what it's called? Adventure time? Cause that

2413
03:31:05,540 --> 03:31:09,260
show is adventure time with Finn and Jake. That show is pretty funny. I will say that

2414
03:31:09,260 --> 03:31:13,420
it's a good show. All right, that's it. We're done. We'll be back next week. Loki will be

2415
03:31:13,420 --> 03:31:18,260
back finally next week and we'll get his top three and a plenty more gaming news. You know,

2416
03:31:18,260 --> 03:31:22,220
we're into a new year. Uh, the news is going to start to come out as we get into the first

2417
03:31:22,220 --> 03:31:28,300
quarter releases and E3 in the summer all towards another clusterfucker releases in

2418
03:31:28,300 --> 03:31:32,340
October, November of 2012 right before the world ends. Have a wonderful week, everybody.

2419
03:31:32,340 --> 03:31:36,620
