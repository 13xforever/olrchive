00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:24,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, January 1st, 2012, DLC is finally coming to the 3DS, Valve says Half-Life 3 rumors are just trolling, and a fan remake of a computer game classic has been released.

2
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:36,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:42,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It is episode number 440 for this January 1st, 2012.

5
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:44,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Really easy day to remember.

6
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:51,333
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk video games with my co-host, first off, the one, the only, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Or DarkSakura, whatever you want to call her.

8
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:55,734
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?

9
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:57,535
[SPEAKER_06]: When people get my name right.

10
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,557
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:24,111
[SPEAKER_09]: He had a family engagement, I mean it is technically a holiday, New Year's Day, and so sometimes there's family stuff, especially with the new baby he's got.

12
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:27,593
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've got a family thing going on, so he's not here tonight.

13
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:29,675
[SPEAKER_06]: That baby is not as new as that baby once was.

14
00:01:32,037 --> 00:01:33,518
[SPEAKER_06]: He better have the baby thing down.

15
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,459
[SPEAKER_09]: That baby's getting older just like you.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And you.

17
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:42,765
[SPEAKER_09]: But joining us tonight, as he tends to do when we need another host, please welcome to the studio, Alan.

18
00:01:42,805 --> 00:01:43,466
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, Alan?

19
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:43,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

20
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:44,967
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

21
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:46,504
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

22
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:12,716
[SPEAKER_09]: The week before that, though, was our last show, and that was the last show from Studio DarkSakura, or the fifth studio in OLR's history.

23
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:13,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

24
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:15,237
[SPEAKER_09]: But tonight we are in a new studio.

25
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:18,038
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Studio 6, and it's from Alan and I's place.

26
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:18,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

27
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,818
[SPEAKER_09]: So... Rob.

28
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:20,159
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

29
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:20,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch your grammar.

30
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:21,459
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

31
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:22,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine and Alan.

32
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,100
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be Alan and my house.

33
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:26,800
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Shut and Up?

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,441
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Bite My Butt?

35
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:46,616
[SPEAKER_09]: 3rd, no, 2nd studio we were in, which was when Loki and I lived together.

36
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:47,756
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a while ago, right?

37
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:51,198
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually did the show kind of in the dining room and in the living room.

38
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:52,439
[SPEAKER_09]: There was antics that always happen.

39
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,720
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of a similar setup to what we have going on right now in this Studio 6.

40
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:02,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're hoping at some point we can return the live streaming of games and stuff during the show over one of them stream and video websites.

41
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:04,185
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to use JustinTV.

42
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done stuff on Ustream.

43
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:06,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

44
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:07,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know which way we'd go.

45
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:08,967
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure that out when we actually have video.

46
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:13,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I now have experience doing custom graphics for Justin, for not for Justin TV, for Ustream, so.

47
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, hey.

48
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:14,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

49
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:15,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

50
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I did them for you, for Umlaut.

51
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:17,893
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

52
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:25,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello to the chatters, chatroom.orangeloungeradio, or excuse me, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

53
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:26,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little rusty after a week off.

54
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:32,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can join us if you want to talk live with us here on this New Year's Day.

55
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like we have a Bobby Blackwolf Did he just join?

56
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:40,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi Bobby How come Bobby could show up for our show but he couldn't be bothered to do his own show tonight?

57
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:59,818
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because he likes our show better As I said to the all games chatters, Bobby didn't want to work, he just wanted to bang on the drum all day That's a joke because he does drumming stuff for the Atlanta Falcons So my mother is calling me on my cell phone right now, like doesn't she know I have a radio show on Sunday nights?

58
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:00,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't she know?

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe she's listening.

60
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:05,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, what do you mean you moved the show to your house?

61
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:06,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, did that cost money?

62
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:07,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob?

63
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob?

64
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:09,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

65
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,272
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live, of course, Sunday nights, every Sunday night, even when it's New Year's Day.

66
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:20,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And All Games Radio is the kind and gracious network that allows us to steal their bandwidth no matter what studio we're in.

67
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:27,824
[SPEAKER_09]: www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, typically after the Bobby Blackwolf show when he's, you know, not off drumming.

68
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:29,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, after the show, R9 cast.

69
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:33,769
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a jumbo episode because they are usually on it for Pacific.

70
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And they went long.

71
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:36,632
[SPEAKER_09]: They had an extended edition.

72
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:37,713
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

73
00:04:58,126 --> 00:04:59,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might have caught a couple.

74
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,088
[SPEAKER_09]: But the flea market is basically... I don't know how to describe it for those that have never been.

75
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:08,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine everybody's been to one at some point in their town, but then some people might not live in places big enough that have them.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

77
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,591
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're basically like gigantic garage sales.

78
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that an accurate description, Alan?

79
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:16,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I guess you could say that.

80
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,634
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the wares are new and handmade, though.

81
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not all recycled junk, but... I like to think of it as a giant thrift store.

82
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:24,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:26,377
[SPEAKER_09]: That works.

84
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:27,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

85
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:28,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge farmer's market.

86
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the biggest farmer's market I've ever seen.

87
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:31,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

88
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:34,175
[SPEAKER_09]: The one here we have locally in the Sacramento area is just gigantic.

89
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:38,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the things that's fun to go shopping for is produce.

90
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:39,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And we bought blood oranges.

91
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:39,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

92
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:42,537
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other thing that's fun to go shopping for is video games.

93
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:45,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's a lot of people that will bring out their old shit.

94
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:53,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And even I saw arcade machines for sale in some of the little side... They have a side auction.

95
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird.

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the side auction, they had...

97
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It's technically a different one.

98
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,240
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Auction Town.

99
00:05:59,401 --> 00:05:59,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

100
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not part of Deny-Os where we went.

101
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:06,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we saw Burger Time for $950, like a legit arcade cabinet.

102
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cabinet was in good shape.

103
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good for its age.

104
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering that game is from, what, 82?

105
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe somewhere around there, 82, 83.

106
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:20,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering that game is as old as it is, that machine was in beautiful condition.

107
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:20,634
[SPEAKER_09]: It was $950, and I was like,

108
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:22,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan!

109
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:25,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see what was on the other side of the machine next to it?

110
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:26,396
[SPEAKER_09]: No, what was that?

111
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:29,036
[SPEAKER_06]: A berserk in just as good condition.

112
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:29,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

113
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:32,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that's the old one with the little bouncing ball, like the little happy face.

114
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

115
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But we did buy video games.

116
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,658
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I know I bought video games.

117
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:43,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought SingStar Queen, which I've talked about on the show before that I wanted it, but I wasn't going to get it until it went on sale.

118
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess I forgot to get it amongst all the other video games that came out last year because it was a crazy year.

119
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,782
[SPEAKER_09]: and I bought Seeing Star Queen for $8 at the flea market.

120
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:54,764
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome and it was sealed.

121
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:55,944
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have been resealed.

122
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:59,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes the stuff at the flea market, they've used the little machine to reseal it, but it worked fine.

123
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it the other day.

124
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:02,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I bought, get this,

125
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:03,909
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

126
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:49,223
[SPEAKER_09]: it didn't play exactly like the board game like it kind of put this logic puzzle twist on it where it would tell you like the lead pipe was in the conservatory and you have to kind of like tie it all together so if if Miss Peacock was in the conservatory then she must have had the lead pipe you know that whole thing so um yeah good times so it's cool to play retro games and a favorite of mine was Clue on the Super Nintendo for no particular reason it wasn't really that great of a game but it's

127
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:52,579
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

128
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I did and we ate them all last night.

129
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:21,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

130
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,195
[SPEAKER_09]: That tortilla lady took you to the cleaners.

131
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought two for three.

132
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:27,336
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not bad.

133
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Two bags and there were six in each.

134
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I did what she suggested.

135
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:36,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I got pumpkin tortillas which were amazing because pumpkin everything is awesome.

136
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,759
[SPEAKER_09]: You know it wouldn't be OLR if we didn't have a food tangent.

137
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,721
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

138
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:00,279
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

139
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're projecting a little bit.

140
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:17,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.

141
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:25,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing is that I had a lot of amazing Super Nintendo games with the box and instruction booklet and they were all in perfect shape because I treat my stuff very well.

142
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:34,758
[SPEAKER_02]: They've all been sold on eBay years and years ago for a lot of money and I was kind of reminded actually of the price of how some of those games go for at the flea market.

143
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the Super Nest Lufia?

144
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

145
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 80 bucks you wanted for that cart.

146
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's still some rare stuff out there.

147
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:43,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have them but I got rid of them.

148
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,904
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you guys are welcome to borrow.

149
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:49,825
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have the wild hair to play anything, you're welcome to borrow anything I've got.

150
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:56,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I think most stuff on the Super Nintendo, I don't know, it's really like I'll get an urge to just play it.

151
00:09:56,347 --> 00:10:01,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm usually trying to play the new stuff to keep on top of stuff.

152
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:05,349
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very rare that I'm like, oh, I want to go play Clue on the Super Nintendo.

153
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,430
[SPEAKER_09]: But when it's right in front of me, I go, I remember how cool this game was.

154
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to just pick this up and take it home because it's half off.

155
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:11,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid...

156
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,132
[SPEAKER_09]: How many did you get through?

157
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:14,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even one.

158
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:39,595
[SPEAKER_06]: We're toward the end of what we just got.

159
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:42,715
[SPEAKER_06]: When we last played, everyone got their upgrades.

160
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,556
[SPEAKER_09]: You got through Final Fantasy 1-2.

161
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:46,296
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Final Fantasy Half.

162
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, something about just starting off with 6.

163
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:54,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting down and going through 6.

164
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:10,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I like 4 don't get me wrong but 6 is one that we'll just take turns with because I know that game like the back of my freaking hand I've played through that game so many million times or Chrono Trigger because then it's just a matter of New Game Plus

165
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:12,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Nintendos Never Die

166
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:32,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Those things are pretty durable.

167
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought this was interesting.

168
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:42,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaijudo kind of followed it up a little later with, the sad thing is 20 years from now, I doubt many people will say they have a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 that still works.

169
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:43,854
[SPEAKER_09]: How true.

170
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:47,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the old systems were quite durable, weren't they?

171
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were all just hard plastic with a little green circuit board in it.

172
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:51,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

173
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not many moving parts.

174
00:11:52,757 --> 00:12:00,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Dan said that they had dropped a Super Nintendo down two flights of stairs and it still worked when he was a kid.

175
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:01,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Those things are rocks.

176
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:02,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they were.

177
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:07,129
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet, an Xbox 360, you're lucky to get one that never red rings.

178
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,272
[SPEAKER_06]: You knock it over once onto the carpet and it's dead.

179
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:13,138
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

180
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:16,862
[SPEAKER_09]: They sure don't build them like they used to, but of course, a lot of that could be, to be fair.

181
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:24,271
[SPEAKER_09]: We did make a conversion somewhere along the way from cartridges to CDs, therefore DVDs, therefore Blu-rays.

182
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:27,215
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a pretty major shift in format.

183
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: well you can even see just in model releases they go from being super sturdy like I have a first model PS3 and it's still in perfect condition it still plays everything wonderfully well but then you get the newer ones the slims and they're just they feel like nothing they've got no durability they're missing options and they cost you know when they were coming out they were costing as much as the old models did

184
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:54,897
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

185
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, awesome, because I do have Keyboard Mania.

186
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:19,958
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the trunk.

187
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:23,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, if you wanted to hold on to it and do doubles, you're welcome to.

188
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:24,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'll have to get out my PlayStation 2.

189
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:28,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so yeah, flea market shopping, that's one of the things, fun things we did.

190
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:37,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I saw in chat, Actdeft says a friend shops on flea market swap meets and resells the stuff he finds on eBay for a living.

191
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:43,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe DarkSakura was actually talking to one of her friends there that she used to buy a lot of stuff from who said that he doesn't haggle.

192
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:43,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Trader Dan.

193
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:44,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Trader Dan.

194
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:49,665
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't haggle really because he knows that if they haggle with him, they're just trying to remarket it on eBay.

195
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:49,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

196
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:51,025
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what he said.

197
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:57,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's actually said he stopped dealing on eBay and he's doing like on eTrader or something, some website.

198
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:59,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I caught that end of the conversation.

199
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:02,089
[SPEAKER_09]: He seemed very irritated with eBay and Amazon.

200
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what happened there.

201
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:10,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Amazon... He used to just completely resell everything, all the good stuff on eBay.

202
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:14,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and didn't Amazon kick everyone in California out because of the whole tax thing?

203
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:15,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

204
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:15,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they did.

205
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:17,455
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think he did Amazon.

206
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he was strictly eBay and Yahoo.

207
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:20,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

208
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

209
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:23,174
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

210
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this comparison.

211
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting comparison.

212
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:29,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'll move on with How Was Your Gaming Week here in the chat room from SepWin.

213
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:34,664
[SPEAKER_09]: CEPWin in the chat at chat.orange.com says, It's like buildings.

214
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:42,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think the biggest NFL stadiums will be around 100 years from now, let alone 2000 as the Roman Coliseum?

215
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's an example.

216
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I've made no thing.

217
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:49,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from Mobile, Alabama.

218
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:54,806
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a building that was recently restored that was built in like 1850 something.

219
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:58,848
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe after the city was like 150 years old.

220
00:14:58,868 --> 00:14:58,928
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

221
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:10,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still in, even when it was run down, it was still in sturdy condition and lived through years of hurricanes.

222
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:11,934
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred years worth of hurricanes.

223
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:17,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we had, you know, some of the newer buildings had been flooded down and were corroded and everything.

224
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:26,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So just even as an example, in a couple hundred years, you know, construction, we're leaning towards cheaper things that they don't last, right?

225
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a lot of stuff is built for the environment, too.

226
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, here in California, you don't have brick buildings because of earthquakes.

227
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:32,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

228
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:36,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Alabama, almost everything is made out of brick and concrete.

229
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's just interesting.

230
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:40,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And buildings are cheaper there, ironically.

231
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:40,664
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true.

232
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:47,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though they'll last through probably more hard weather than California sees.

233
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:47,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

234
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:04,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, construction.

235
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:05,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

236
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:08,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, you didn't end up buying anything at the flea market, but did anything catch your eye?

237
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you had the money burning a hole in your pocket?

238
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Trader Dan had a lot of big promotional standy things.

239
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:24,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he had that big Samus Super Metroid thing that was like six or seven feet tall from Super Metroid.

240
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:24,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

241
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,847
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I wanted that from the new studio.

242
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:28,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably not for sale because he has it mounted way up high on the wall.

243
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:29,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

244
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah.

245
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:30,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

246
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, he'd sell almost anything if you offer him the right amount, so.

247
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:39,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, because we've bought some stuff that was just on the collection wall before.

248
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:39,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

249
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:42,219
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was back when he had the store in Rio Linda.

250
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:45,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, we put some pictures in the new studio up at orangelawnradio.com.

251
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,305
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little picture bar towards the top of the screen, and you can kind of see some pictures that we take.

252
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:54,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what the website says, you can send in your own pictures, but due to some abuse things we had happen a couple months ago, we had to pull that.

253
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's only the hosts, really, that are adding stuff to that, and we just added a bunch of pictures from the studio.

254
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:00,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's...

255
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,897
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the scrolls and things like that, so it's pretty cool.

256
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:13,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it was funny looking at the flea market at the big collections of the Game Gear and the Atari Lynx and both the console and the cartridge.

257
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:16,129
[SPEAKER_02]: How did anyone ever try to market that as portable?

258
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Either system.

259
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:19,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They were both huge.

260
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:21,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at an old school Game Boy.

261
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember the commercial with the guy sitting on the toilet playing the Lynx?

262
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:24,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

263
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:53,057
[SPEAKER_09]: and I had a Game Gear and I remember it went through four AA batteries probably every 72 hours and it's like worse battery life than a 3DS it weighs four pounds like how is that ever but yeah it was neat seeing all of that really old hardware well go look at an old school Game Boy like those things are fucking bricks but I remember you would have the case for it and I would put it in a backpack and take it to school and it was portable you know back then I just had an inspiration Rob what you know how the people built the house out of Legos

264
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to build a house out of Game Boys.

265
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:11,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

266
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:12,698
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be tricky.

267
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:13,979
[SPEAKER_09]: An entire house?

268
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:16,461
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be able to get a doggy house.

269
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:21,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, maybe like a little office or a storage room or something.

270
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:25,467
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that, or even just do a wall, a wall of Game Boy's.

271
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:27,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a modern art piece?

272
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:28,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, instead of, you know.

273
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,931
[SPEAKER_09]: The 8-bit gaming exhibit that they do?

274
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:38,796
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, instead of tile, you know, with the plaster, tile and plaster, do plaster in Game Boy's.

275
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:41,157
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

276
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:54,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of World of Warcrafts.

277
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:59,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, not a lot because my computer was off for close to a week.

278
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we just got our cable back.

279
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:02,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you had no interwebs for like four days.

280
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:05,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I had to come over here on Christmas Day.

281
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:07,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

282
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:09,331
[SPEAKER_06]: To get my damn Merrymaker achievement.

283
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Open presents under the tree in Ironforge.

284
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:18,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I remember that because then we went out for... Nothing's open on Christmas, but we were able to find that Pha was open on Christmas.

285
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:24,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a proper Jew, I had Asian food on Christmas Day, even if it wasn't Chinese.

286
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:25,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember putting a tweet or something.

287
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:28,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, two gays and a Jew walk into a pho bar on Christmas.

288
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:30,302
[SPEAKER_06]: It was delicious.

289
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:31,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was very good.

290
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:31,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Delicious.

291
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:41,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played, well, once everything got hooked up, I played a little bit of Fractal, which I really like that game.

292
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:43,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you talked about that last week on the show, or two weeks.

293
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:44,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

294
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:44,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Very pretty.

295
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:53,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And we played rock band, of course, like we do every party that we have The quintessential party game Yes, and Bradley came over

296
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:54,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Arcadian 42.

297
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

298
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,442
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get him over here in the new studio.

299
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:57,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And he brought cymbals.

300
00:19:58,504 --> 00:20:03,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he proceeded to impress the cousins with his prowess in pro drum mode.

301
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he does the pro drumming.

302
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:06,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

303
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:14,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had... Well, when I left the house, Dan was watching a playthrough of Gradius on the...

304
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Boy, like the old school Gradius on the Game Boy.

305
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I saw little Moai heads.

306
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:26,487
[SPEAKER_06]: We did, I think we did have a little bit of Proteus going on in the house.

307
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was fun.

308
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:30,169
[SPEAKER_06]: But mostly it was just putting up games.

309
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've probably touched a couple thousand games this weekend.

310
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:35,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally touched them.

311
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,113
[SPEAKER_06]: But as for playing them, that's a different story.

312
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:41,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's also the flea market games that you touched.

313
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:43,456
[SPEAKER_09]: You put your paws on a lot of those too, digging through things.

314
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:43,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

315
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:52,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I really did try to... It's sad going to Trader Dan's, though, because the stuff that he had out, the stuff I would have wanted, was the stuff I already have.

316
00:20:53,647 --> 00:21:00,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, well, see, that's why I was asking who had a Master System, because we have spare games.

317
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:03,219
[SPEAKER_06]: We do literally have spare Master System games.

318
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, any of our listeners, if you have a master system, send me a photo of your master system.

319
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:15,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first person that sends me a picture of their own personal master system will get a game.

320
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:16,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can I email that?

321
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:17,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you don't have an OLR email anymore.

322
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLunchRadio.com Show email.

323
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:20,803
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

324
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:22,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Mail the mailbag.

325
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has to be your master system.

326
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:55,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't Google the picture Maybe they need to put You need to tell them to put a little post-it note that says OLR So we know they didn't like Google it OLR, has to have a post-it note And keep in mind, I'm a designer I can tell if you photoshopped it Yeah, or something If you don't have post-it notes for fuck's sake Just scribble it on a notepad or something And maybe I'll be kind enough And if you've got a power base converter I'll accept that as well Alright Anyhow Inadvertent contest here on the show Alan, why don't you go next

327
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:59,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been several months since I've been on OLRs.

328
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:01,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually completed a lot of games.

329
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:05,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Dragon Age Origins that came out in 2009.

330
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:09,885
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple months ago I fired that up and I just couldn't let it go.

331
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:14,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Between that and the expansion Awakenings, I completed both of those.

332
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:19,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've logged nearly 100 hours on my Archer Ranger Rogue that I rolled.

333
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:21,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I never realized you finished Awakenings.

334
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:27,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that you moved on to Dragon Age 2 at one point, and I was like, oh, maybe he just finally got ADD, and he was like, I gotta go play the sequel.

335
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize you finished Awakenings.

336
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:30,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.

337
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:37,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much with any RPG now, I use a FAQ or a walkthrough to play it, just because I'm old and lazy, and I don't want to miss things the first way through.

338
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,013
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something secret.

339
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I used FAQs.

340
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:46,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Age Oranges was about 70 hours, and Awakenings was about 24 hours before I beat it.

341
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:56,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I played a little Dragon Age 2, which got derailed by Skyrim, because Steam had Skyrim for $40 for 24 hours during its holiday sale.

342
00:22:56,218 --> 00:23:00,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, for the game that a lot are calling Game of the Year, that just came out a couple months ago, is a steal.

343
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so $40 for Skyrim, which is what I'm actively playing.

344
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:10,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a PSA to live listeners, the Encore sale is going on today, and that is $40 again.

345
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:12,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so they brought Skyrim back for $40.

346
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:13,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that'll be it.

347
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:13,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

348
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:14,885
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

349
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:32,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know.

350
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:33,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to ask.

351
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious if the folks... Do we have any chatters?

352
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:38,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to go home now and check my Steam.

353
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:39,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do it during the show.

354
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:42,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless there's Steam for Linux now.

355
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:42,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

356
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:44,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious.

357
00:23:44,428 --> 00:23:46,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, did the folks in chat...

358
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:47,209
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

359
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:47,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any?

360
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Ake Ripper in chat.

361
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:50,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Ake Ripper, can you use Steam?

362
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:51,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweden?

363
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:52,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Close enough.

364
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:58,017
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be able to log into the Steam website and buy something on the website on your account and then it'll download to the client.

365
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:58,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wait till you get home.

366
00:23:58,858 --> 00:23:59,378
[SPEAKER_02]: You have till 10 a.m.

367
00:23:59,418 --> 00:23:59,718
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow.

368
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:10,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'm kind of juggling Dragon Age 2 and Skyrim right now and those are both pretty meaty meals of a game so I don't know how long I'm gonna be able to juggle those two.

369
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:16,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a DSi XL for Christmas for my lovely, kind, generous boyfriend in studio.

370
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:21,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of my DSi XL, I've been playing WarioWare Touched.

371
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:22,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we back up a minute?

372
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this certainly caught me off guard.

373
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I asked you, I said, what do you want for Christmas?

374
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:27,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And you said you wanted a DSi XL.

375
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, you want that?

376
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:30,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it costs as much as a 3DS?

377
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:35,934
[SPEAKER_09]: So just for the listeners that might be asking the same question, why an XL?

378
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:36,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Why now?

379
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:37,434
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to answer.

380
00:24:37,634 --> 00:25:04,180
[SPEAKER_02]: well you have a 3DS and I can play yours when you're at work honest answer that and I have a thing I almost have a thing against Nintendo but the first generation of their little hardware portables I thought the DS original the DS fat was ugly and it looked cheap and the DS light was like oh okay this looks like a good device that's when I finally got on board with the DS was with the light

381
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:33,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think with the weird analog stick on the right side attachment that came out for the 3DS I want the second generation and when I play Mario Kart 7 on your 3DS I can only do two races before my right hand is completely cramped because I have big giant spindly spidery man hands and it hurts to play so I have my giant DS XL and I've got a ton of DS games RPGs that I haven't played so

382
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:35,308
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fair enough.

383
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:36,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

384
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:37,590
[SPEAKER_09]: When you explained it to me, it made a lot of sense.

385
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, all right.

386
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:40,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus, now that I've really got my paws on one of those.

387
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:41,874
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really nice device.

388
00:25:41,894 --> 00:25:42,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a nice device.

389
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:48,001
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a bummer it was so late in the life and now a lot of folks have moved on because, you know, it's a pretty rock solid DS.

390
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:56,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to take a step back for just a minute and chatters have clarified Actdeft from Mexico, Steam sales work worldwide.

391
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:56,970
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

392
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:09,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So aside from MarioWare Touched on the XL, I also did my sort of annual playthrough of Half-Life and Half-Life 2 episodes 1 and 2.

393
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat those from start to finish.

394
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,141
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of like your version of DarkSakura's Christmas Nights, I notice.

395
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Once or twice a year, I just get Half-Life fever and I got to play through it.

396
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:23,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to do Half-Life 2, like the proper Half-Life 2.

397
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:24,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done that yet.

398
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:30,654
[SPEAKER_09]: and some chatters in chat might be thinking about a story that happened in Gaming News this week and yes, we'll be talking about that later.

399
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:32,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, Bastion's five bucks.

400
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:34,136
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good game.

401
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:34,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good game.

402
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:36,637
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of a game of the year list.

403
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:38,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of game of the year list, I do want to get this out at some point.

404
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:46,342
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's 2012, but since we didn't have a show last week and the way timing worked out, we need to have a proper end of the year recap.

405
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:47,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be talking about our games of the year.

406
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:51,104
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, myself, and Alan have picked our top three games of the year.

407
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:52,385
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get Loki's next week, guys.

408
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:53,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry when he's back.

409
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:56,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But we want to hear your guys' game of the year picks too.

410
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:58,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have some posts on Facebook and Google+.

411
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:04,670
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you haven't chimed in yet, go do that because we're going to do that in part B. And some of our picks might surprise you.

412
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:32,404
[SPEAKER_09]: so I know that there are probably what three games that everybody's picking well we'll see maybe our lists are the same three maybe not but I want to emphasize there's no right or wrong answers and I gotta say just looking at Facebook and Google Plus I'm really impressed at the diversity of choices I really truly don't think that just because every media outlet says game A, B, or C is the game of the year means everybody else is on board like I don't think any two people have picked the same game very interesting so anyway

413
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:34,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

414
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:34,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Where were we?

415
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:35,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Your gaming week, Alan.

416
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that that's it.

417
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:48,128
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as this week, I've scrambled around on the Steam contest for the holiday sale where you unlock Steve achievements to earn coupons.

418
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:55,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I have two coupons for 50% off any Valve game, good through, I think, the 1st of March.

419
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:58,270
[SPEAKER_02]: If an OLR listener wants to add me on Steam, I'll trade them that coupon.

420
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:02,357
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have an OLR group on Steam that they could find you on.

421
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:14,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played Psychonauts for about an hour and a half to be able to use my mind power that Pyromania to burn two squirrels because there was an achievement for cooking two critters.

422
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:19,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played some games like Super Meat Boy has one yesterday that I need to go through.

423
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:20,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all.

424
00:28:20,803 --> 00:28:21,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're doing that too.

425
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:24,905
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to find us on Steam or any of that stuff, it's awesome.

426
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:42,578
[SPEAKER_09]: On OrangeLaunchRadio.com, in the upper right-hand corner is this little box that says Extended Play, and you'll see all the logos for all the community social networking websites, and you'll see the Steam logo on there, and you can join the OLR clan, and you can say hi to Alan or Salacious Pop, and he'll give you treats, it sounds like.

427
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:43,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

428
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:43,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

429
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

430
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,280
[SPEAKER_09]: He may not have enough for everybody.

431
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:47,242
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week.

432
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:50,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played a lot of hodgepodge kind of stuff.

433
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:52,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I mentioned before, I bought Seeing Star Queen, Clue.

434
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:58,670
[SPEAKER_09]: There's probably two games primarily I've been playing, kind of focusing on the past couple weeks.

435
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:08,817
[SPEAKER_09]: First one I'll mention is on the 3DS, a port of one of my favorite games that I played for the first time last year, even though the game is actually a couple years old itself.

436
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:12,400
[SPEAKER_09]: VVVVVV came out for the 3DS.

437
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,962
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the 3DS shop, I mean literally, like just last week.

438
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:20,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's a very faithful port of the version that's on the PC.

439
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:25,606
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have the level editor, although they're saying that that may be coming in the future.

440
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:30,208
[SPEAKER_09]: But you do have some, like, best of user-created levels, which is pretty cool.

441
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:32,729
[SPEAKER_09]: and, of course, the game's in 3D a little bit.

442
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:35,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not complicated 3D.

443
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:37,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like the NES classics.

444
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:40,674
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like three different layers of 3D you kind of see things on.

445
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:46,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But the game itself, VVVVV, is a great game, an excellent game.

446
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:50,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks may find it to be a little bit short, but I think it's well worth it for the $8.

447
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:52,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Kick-ass soundtrack.

448
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:55,558
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of very similar to Super Metroid.

449
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:59,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Very easy gimmick, the whole gravity flipping thing, but it works so well.

450
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:00,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's a great game.

451
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:01,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

452
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:13,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, as somebody who loved Commodore 64 and really grew up on Commodore 64, I love that the game has a lot of, you know, kind of tips of the hat to the Commodore 64 days, including the loading screen.

453
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:13,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

454
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:16,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the 3DS version is a worthy port.

455
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:32,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize some people may have a hard time justifying, well, I just bought VVVV as part of the Humble Indie Bundle that was just out because it was one of the games from the third that came back and I paid five bucks for like 15 games that included VVVV.

456
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:36,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I go pay $7 in the 3DS shop now?

457
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,529
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a damn good question.

458
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's not worth it in that regard.

459
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:42,713
[SPEAKER_09]: But for me, I love the idea of having a portable version.

460
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:45,474
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, sometimes you just want games to be able to have wherever you are.

461
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:53,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Airport, you know, commuting or whatever it is that you're doing, you know, out and about, it's sometimes nice to have some games to go.

462
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,381
[SPEAKER_09]: And VVVVV is a worthy addition to the 3DS lineup.

463
00:30:58,622 --> 00:30:59,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see.

464
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:11,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, the other game that I spent a huge chunk of time playing is Star Wars The Old Republic, the new MMO that's out from BioWare and EA.

465
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I did pick this up the 21st, the day after it was out.

466
00:31:16,452 --> 00:31:19,914
[SPEAKER_09]: and I've spent a good part of the past couple weeks playing it.

467
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:23,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I have like four characters in the level 10-ish range.

468
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Two of them Imperial and two of them Empire.

469
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've gotten a good feel especially for the introduction parts of the game.

470
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:33,703
[SPEAKER_09]: God, where do I even begin with this?

471
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,425
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are comparing it to WoW.

472
00:31:37,125 --> 00:32:04,117
[SPEAKER_09]: and I gotta say this comment first I'm really amazed with how pressed some of the Star Wars players are when it comes to WoW because the general chat half the time is nothing but talk about oh this game is so much better than WoW and oh this game just kicks WoW's ass and oh WoW is a kiddie game and they're just bringing pandas because it's a kiddie game I used to play WoW but it sucks now and it's like wow you guys hate WoW so much you can't stop talking about it

473
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,551
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not really a slam on Star Wars.

474
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:10,273
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a slam on the chat community.

475
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:12,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I was comparing it to Star Trek Online.

476
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:13,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's my point.

477
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:15,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Let both games just be.

478
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:20,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Because does Star Wars have a lot of inspiration from WoW?

479
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:21,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

480
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:25,504
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the classes I was playing, I was laughing because I'm like, this plays just like a warrior.

481
00:32:25,524 --> 00:32:28,306
[SPEAKER_09]: It even has a talent called Sunder and you build up rage.

482
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, this is just like a WoW warrior.

483
00:32:30,688 --> 00:32:31,969
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time,

484
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,855
[SPEAKER_09]: The questing in Star Wars, the Old Republic, is so immersive.

485
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,518
[SPEAKER_09]: The voice acting really adds a neat element to it.

486
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:45,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the whole Bioware touch of the conversation trees.

487
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:50,607
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that you can have your character be light side or dark side, even within...

488
00:32:51,147 --> 00:33:16,482
[SPEAKER_09]: The Empire or Imperial like you can be a bad Jedi or you can be a good Sith it's really funky how that works but I like that and the group conversation is really interesting too I've been playing the game a lot with Shane and like we will both kind of go out and quest together and he likes to have his person be good and I like to have mine be bad so it's kind of funny watching that struggle and you get to see kind of different outcomes and all that so it's neat

489
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:24,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to finish my thought really quick though on the whole pressed Star Wars people and WoW.

490
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:29,031
[SPEAKER_09]: WoW obviously got its inspiration from other games too, and that's important to say.

491
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:33,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Star Wars is just this company's evolution of the MMO genre.

492
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:35,936
[SPEAKER_09]: And the question is, does it work?

493
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:40,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And my answer is, in most places, yes, but in a few places, no.

494
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:52,524
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think any MMO is going to have this problem when it first comes out and that's kind of about finding the balance and I think that's where the game has its trickiest part right now is balance and a lot of that has to do with the economy.

495
00:33:53,004 --> 00:34:04,729
[SPEAKER_09]: The economy is really clouded, uncertain right now and it's really hard to make money and they just nerfed one of the big professions for that and so a lot of that needs some fine tuning but

496
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:07,051
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the game's only been out two weeks.

497
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:08,792
[SPEAKER_09]: For an MMO, that's hardly anything.

498
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:10,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure a lot of that will be fixed in time.

499
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:18,019
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other thing I've got to knock Star Wars for, because this is something I keep saying every time I'm playing the game, damn, I wish they would fix this.

500
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,263
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the reasons I love WoW is the community and the UIs that they've built.

501
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:33,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And Star Wars desperately needs to open it up and let users make their own UIs and interfaces and add-ons, especially for things like the auction house, especially for things like targeting.

502
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:35,232
[SPEAKER_09]: and things of that sort.

503
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:40,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you have two people and their companions out, healing is kind of a pain in the butt.

504
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:44,198
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to see some UI changes for that.

505
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:49,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the ways things are set up are a little weird and I just think the community could improve on that a little bit.

506
00:34:50,342 --> 00:35:19,225
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's I mean especially compared to I played Rift when it first came out I played Warhammer when it first came out I played you know I've played a lot of the Ion I played Ion when it first came out I played a lot of the other ones and this is really the first one where I was like wow this really is something different this is a neat experience this you know I like the story which is weird because I'm not even that big on the Star Wars movies like you know I

507
00:35:19,605 --> 00:35:20,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate them.

508
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:25,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand why there's fandom for the old movies from the 70s at least, not the new ones.

509
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:32,913
[SPEAKER_09]: But I get why Star Wars is popular, but I found myself really getting kind of sucked into the story, and it's really interesting.

510
00:35:33,253 --> 00:35:40,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really liked getting to kind of play this character that could be light or dark or neutral or what have you.

511
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So the biggest strengths are in the fact that –

512
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Every single player game element is great.

513
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:51,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could go from 0 to 50 single player, no problem.

514
00:35:51,444 --> 00:36:00,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really helps when MMOs have the mythology pre-built to then bring in... Because Lord of the Rings Online, obviously, Lord of the Rings is...

515
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:04,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars Galaxies wasn't necessarily a bad game.

516
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,330
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a game that made bad decisions.

517
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:32,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, because they switched it up to make it more accessible in all the diehard people.

518
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:33,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

519
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:36,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't alienate your primary fan base.

520
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:38,113
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where WoW is at.

521
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:42,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Because for some people, Cataclysm was the equivalent of the NXE.

522
00:36:43,841 --> 00:37:10,993
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know so anyway or new user what did they call it new user experience whatever it was called anyway but because Bioware doesn't as of yet have a good MMO pedigree they do have a great game pedigree I mean it's Bioware so I didn't really have any doubt in my mind that The Old Republic was going to be bad as just a campaign experience but a lot of people are wondering when once you get to level 50 are there I mean are there raids like what do you do once you're at max level

523
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:16,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently there are operations, I think they're called, which are the equivalent of raids, I believe.

524
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:17,414
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's PvP.

525
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:19,094
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do PvP at level 10 and all that.

526
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:20,915
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's a good question.

527
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:21,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really sure.

528
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:25,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sitting here as somebody who's been playing the game for two weeks, and I'm not really sure.

529
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:30,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with Rift, Rift was a completely new property.

530
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:36,218
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to do all that world building about the conflict, and there's this race and this race and blah, blah, blah, and why these big portals are opening up in the sky.

531
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:55,880
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time which is a different problem altogether and it was just hard to really invest myself in the world that I was playing in whereas with Star Wars and WoW you have the mythology going back years and years that players already that's what brings people to those games I think

532
00:37:57,411 --> 00:38:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So to kind of try and wrap up, because I know I'm rambling here a bit, but to kind of wrap up my thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic, I think it's a good game, and if you're into MMOs, you'll probably want to pounce on this pretty quick, because a lot of people have been.

533
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,664
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're not sure, I say wait, because I think the game's only going to get better with a little more maturity and age.

534
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:26,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think in six months to a year when they really have a lot of players in endgame and they have a lot of this ironed out, I think the game's going to be very neat.

535
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:28,091
[SPEAKER_09]: is it a WoW killer?

536
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:46,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know I don't really like that term because I don't think like there's similar games out there all the time you know Burnout didn't kill Need for Speed and you know Call of Duty and Battlefield can compete you know it's just different and I it's expensive if you want to play both games that's the only bummer but

537
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,341
[SPEAKER_09]: The games can coexist.

538
00:38:49,581 --> 00:38:51,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think one necessarily has to cannibalize the other.

539
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:56,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's going to always be people that want to play WoW and there's going to be people that don't want to play WoW that want to play Star Wars.

540
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:00,149
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be people like me that kind of want to play a little bit of both.

541
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,230
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

542
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:07,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, I do want to quickly ask you, though, because you play a lot of MMOs.

543
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:09,514
[SPEAKER_09]: You've come on the other show, Horde House, a lot to talk about WoW.

544
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:10,635
[SPEAKER_09]: You play a lot of WoW.

545
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:11,616
[SPEAKER_09]: You raid in WoW.

546
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:12,596
[SPEAKER_09]: You're an endgame raider.

547
00:39:12,636 --> 00:39:14,657
[SPEAKER_09]: You're one of the tops of the server.

548
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:17,519
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't seem to have that same interest in Star Wars.

549
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that because of your investment in WoW?

550
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:22,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a money thing?

551
00:39:23,102 --> 00:39:25,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just being a hater?

552
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:25,663
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?

553
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:32,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've dedicated myself to raiding with people 12 hours a week, which is a lot.

554
00:39:33,147 --> 00:39:38,451
[SPEAKER_02]: and I am comfortable with that arrangement for right now.

555
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:42,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I get a job, I will probably have to quit doing that.

556
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:43,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a financial thing.

557
00:39:43,856 --> 00:39:47,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already staked my claim with my rating guild in WoW.

558
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:54,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I don't want to pay $15 a month twice for that.

559
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:58,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also on the year-long Diablo III Death Pact.

560
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:08,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've pretty much said, yes, wow, regardless of how bad you get or how lame your patches are, I'm going to be sticking with you for a year, and I'm committed to that.

561
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:11,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really need Wandering Eyes for MMOs.

562
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:12,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Though I will say, though, the reason why I...

563
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:28,890
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I decided to start playing Dragon Age Origins until I beat it was the fact that aside from raiding, I am kind of burned out on WoW, so that's helping my console gaming more.

564
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:33,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been more into WoW than I have been into WoW, which is really weird.

565
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:41,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's just because I've had a lot of time off work, so I've had more time to play things, or the fact that I am loving Arcane Mage right now in Warcraft, but...

566
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:51,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like, I've really had to, like, I'll play WoW for a couple hours, then I play Star Wars for a couple hours, then I go back to playing WoW for a couple... You know, that's been a lot of my vacation when I'm not doing other more productive things, you know?

567
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:52,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

568
00:40:52,694 --> 00:40:54,596
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of chatter's talking about Guild Wars 2.

569
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaijudo, I think, kicked it off.

570
00:40:56,738 --> 00:40:57,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot wait for Guild Wars 2.

571
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,282
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gonna be my main MMO.

572
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:02,004
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I gotta say...

573
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:04,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really interested in Guild Wars 2 as well.

574
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:10,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping the payment model is the same as Guild Wars 1 where it's buy the game and never pay money again.

575
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:12,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Would be great.

576
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:15,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Not have to pay a monthly fee or whatever.

577
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:20,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to Guild Wars 2.

578
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,648
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be another MMO I'm going to have to somehow juggle.

579
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:24,709
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

580
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think in the long run, I may keep... It's hard to say.

581
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been off work this whole time, so I've been able to juggle two MMOs.

582
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:37,712
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I go back to work, I'm probably going to have to pick one or the other.

583
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:38,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've agreed to play WoW for a year.

584
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:41,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the same thing where I've already signed the death pact.

585
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:43,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to be, but I'm not.

586
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:47,918
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think even if I had to choose between the two, I would choose WoW at this point.

587
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:51,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think Star Wars will get better with age.

588
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:52,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it.

589
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:55,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't start playing WoW until Burning Crusade expansion came out.

590
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:57,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I started WoW with vanilla.

591
00:41:59,032 --> 00:41:59,392
[SPEAKER_06]: and hated it.

592
00:41:59,432 --> 00:41:59,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And hated it.

593
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played Burning Crusade and hated it.

594
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:06,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I didn't even bother with any of the other stuff because I still hated it.

595
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Cataclysm came out and I was like, I kind of like this.

596
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:15,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So just me saying I don't want to maybe play Star Wars right now a bad thing?

597
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:16,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily.

598
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:20,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, God, look at my WoW addiction and that just took a couple years to grow.

599
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:20,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

600
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:27,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Star Wars will still be here in a year or two unlike some of these other MMOs that have come out.

601
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:29,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Is anyone still playing Age of Conan?

602
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:34,341
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on the show roll because I think it would have been for last week but we didn't do a Christmas show.

603
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:43,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't SWTOR or The Old Republic hit a million paid subscribers the fastest out of even faster than WoW?

604
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:43,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that a story?

605
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:48,092
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not covering it tonight, but they put out a press release saying that they have a million.

606
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:51,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they've sold like 1.5 million copies of the game globally.

607
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:53,495
[SPEAKER_09]: So that wouldn't surprise me at all.

608
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:54,156
[SPEAKER_09]: They have that many.

609
00:42:54,176 --> 00:42:57,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's still one or two more weeks before people start getting rebills.

610
00:42:58,038 --> 00:43:01,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rebills is when they're going to be able to say that they have subscribers.

611
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:01,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

612
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:03,903
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

613
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:04,484
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

614
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:05,285
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

615
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:07,849
[SPEAKER_09]: There is stuff going on besides MMOs in the world.

616
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:10,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickly, some housekeeping and then we'll get into some news.

617
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:14,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I already mentioned the game of the year we're going to talk about in part B. So stay tuned.

618
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:16,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your picks in at our Facebook or at our Google Plus page.

619
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:18,985
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't have us added on either of those pages...

620
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:20,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you should take care of that.

621
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I want to plug some other things going on elsewhere.

622
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:30,290
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them that I really, really need to plug and make sure you guys know about is something called The Big Battle.

623
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:36,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something that Derek from Dead Pixel Live, which is another show on the All Games Network, is kind of spearheading.

624
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:45,857
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a lot of community shows kind of all pitching in to try and make this thing a success and get more people at the table wanting to kick each other's ass.

625
00:43:46,977 --> 00:43:48,918
[SPEAKER_09]: In a good way, though, because it's all about fighting games.

626
00:43:49,398 --> 00:43:51,778
[SPEAKER_09]: The big battle this time is, I think, the big beatdown.

627
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:53,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all fighting games.

628
00:43:54,179 --> 00:44:00,281
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Mortal Kombat, it's Street Fighter, Arcade Edition, it's Street Fighter 3, it's Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

629
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,421
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all these fighting games.

630
00:44:03,762 --> 00:44:11,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're trying to get as many people in to participate in the tournament to find out which show has the best fighting game fans.

631
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:19,105
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, I'm the only one signed up from OLR, so I'm hoping some of you will head on over to TheBigBattle.net and change that.

632
00:44:19,185 --> 00:44:22,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Sign up over there on the beatdown board for one of the games.

633
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:25,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the only kind of deal-breaker for some people is that it's all Xbox 360.

634
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:28,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of you have these on PS3.

635
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:34,649
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I have Mortal Kombat and Super Street Fighter IV on PS3, so I couldn't sign up for those games, but...

636
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:35,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you can.

637
00:44:36,269 --> 00:44:36,690
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean?

638
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,670
[SPEAKER_06]: You can come to my house.

639
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I could, huh?

640
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:39,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can.

641
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:41,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that mean you're going to sign up too?

642
00:44:41,832 --> 00:44:42,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I will.

643
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:43,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

644
00:44:43,672 --> 00:44:44,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

645
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:45,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

646
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:46,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind, this is Gimpy Hand Lady.

647
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:48,154
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

648
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:50,335
[SPEAKER_09]: You have an arcade stick that you could use, right?

649
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:52,776
[SPEAKER_06]: We have several arcade sticks.

650
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:55,277
[SPEAKER_06]: That won't be a problem.

651
00:44:55,817 --> 00:44:58,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so maybe, maybe we'll work something out.

652
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,740
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, it's all on Xbox 360.

653
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:05,844
[SPEAKER_09]: So Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter 3, Third Strike Online, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

654
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:13,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Go sign up on the beatdown board at thebigbattle.net and say you're going to represent the OL Army or Team OLR.

655
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:14,971
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll know what you're talking about.

656
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:16,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Go sign up and...

657
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:28,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll kick your ass soon if you're playing Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Because that's the one of the games that I do own on the Xbox 360 Which I find funny because you can't buy that game anymore Yet that's the game that has the most signups right now I think people just love the classics What else can you say?

658
00:45:29,556 --> 00:45:44,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So, go sign up Alright, other thing I gotta plug here The Geek-Life Awards You know, we've talked about this website before And part of it is because, you know, Dark Sakura is like, writes for it You still write for it?

659
00:45:44,591 --> 00:45:45,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do.

660
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:47,894
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just with the last semester, I slacked off on my writing.

661
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:50,195
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how busy I was.

662
00:45:50,476 --> 00:46:03,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the editors over there, which I don't believe was DarkSakura, because I think there's got to be rules against that, but the editors over there did nominate us as one of the best podcasts of the years in the second annual Geek Life Awards!

663
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:03,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

664
00:46:04,147 --> 00:46:08,793
[SPEAKER_09]: But the funny thing is, another podcast that was nominated was Horde House, my show about Warcraft.

665
00:46:09,194 --> 00:46:13,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now in the poll, Horde House is beating Orange Lounge Radio for best podcast of the year.

666
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure Extrovert had nothing to do at all with that.

667
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:18,307
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

668
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:48,425
[SPEAKER_09]: God, what are you going to do if you lose to Extifer?

669
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:51,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

670
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess talk about his bleached asshole.

671
00:46:55,435 --> 00:46:55,675
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

672
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:56,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Good answer.

673
00:46:56,436 --> 00:46:56,696
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

674
00:46:57,658 --> 00:47:00,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Horde House, I should mention we haven't done a show for like two weeks over there.

675
00:47:00,922 --> 00:47:01,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a correlation?

676
00:47:02,124 --> 00:47:03,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Bleach your asshole win an award?

677
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:06,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to find out?

678
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:06,967
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

679
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:08,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

680
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:15,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I should say Horde House hasn't had a show for like two weeks and probably won't be back till next week.

681
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:18,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just a timing thing on X for a Nice Part.

682
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:20,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I'm going to be gone for four days next week.

683
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:21,673
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yep.

684
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:22,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

685
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:23,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Busy, busy.

686
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,455
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, it's the holidays so we can kind of get away with it.

687
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,206
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's talk about gaming news.

688
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:29,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get back into what is going on in the gaming industry this week.

689
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:38,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot come to find out, but there are some things going on we do want to bring to the table and talk about with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

690
00:47:38,575 --> 00:47:39,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, start us off tonight.

691
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:53,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nintendo, they've been razzed on so hard, especially by the gentleman that I am subbing for tonight, as far as their inability to embrace stuff that other consoles are doing, particularly online play.

692
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:59,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are jumping on one bandwagon finally, and that is paid DLC.

693
00:48:00,973 --> 00:48:04,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it true that the Wii didn't, you couldn't patch games on the Wii, right?

694
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:08,138
[SPEAKER_09]: There were no... You cannot patch games on the Wii.

695
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:11,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And the proof of this would be what's going on with Skyward Sword.

696
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:15,004
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually had to release this whole channel, and it's there in the Wii shop.

697
00:48:15,044 --> 00:48:24,111
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go look, one of the games I forgot to mention I played this week, I found I had extra points in my Wii balance, or Wii account, so I went and bought Blaster Master for the NES on Virtual Console.

698
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:24,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

699
00:48:24,631 --> 00:48:30,935
[SPEAKER_09]: But as I was looking for the shop, I saw the Fix Your Game File channel for Skyward Sword, and I was like, that has to be embarrassing.

700
00:48:31,335 --> 00:48:34,077
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, they can't just patch Skyward Sword to do it.

701
00:48:34,117 --> 00:48:36,018
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to have a Fix My Game channel.

702
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:42,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So even with their most up until the 3DS, the supplemental content, whether it be

703
00:48:42,782 --> 00:48:43,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.

704
00:49:05,994 --> 00:49:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's going to cost several hundred yen.

705
00:49:08,735 --> 00:49:10,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of vague right now when it comes out.

706
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:19,141
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you can expect with the online store that 3DS has where you can buy the old Game Boy Advance and the little...

707
00:49:20,994 --> 00:49:48,670
[SPEAKER_02]: DSWare games now when you buy a actual retail cart product you can eventually log in maybe either through the game or through your 3DS and buy bonus campaigns for it which is just money money money I mean look at Microsoft and Sony and all the millions they've made with pay to unlock launch day DLC that's on the disc I should say this though the Wii does have the Wii does have kinda download content

708
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

709
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:50,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

710
00:50:13,906 --> 00:50:15,768
[SPEAKER_09]: All of it was third-party companies that were doing it.

711
00:50:15,788 --> 00:50:19,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, Final Fantasy, Square Enix, Rock Band is, you know, Harmonix.

712
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:23,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think any of it is coming from Nintendo themselves.

713
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:24,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what makes us notable.

714
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:29,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Both that, A, it's the 3DS, which, you know, we haven't seen DLC on the 3DS yet.

715
00:50:29,878 --> 00:50:32,140
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen, you know, Buy the Game, right?

716
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I just pimped BBB.

717
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:35,382
[SPEAKER_09]: But we haven't seen DLC.

718
00:50:35,923 --> 00:50:38,364
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's Nintendo themselves now.

719
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:39,705
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big deal.

720
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:40,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

721
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:41,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stand corrected.

722
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:49,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it did have the facilities for DLC, but this one for a handheld definitely is interesting.

723
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:57,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Wii U, they've also confirmed that it's going to have paid DLC, but there's still a lot more we need to find out about the Wii U than just that.

724
00:50:58,394 --> 00:51:05,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Some comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com Yuki says, and here I was respecting Nintendo for not doing DLC till now.

725
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claws theorizing, who knows, maybe a new Zelda quest via DLC.

726
00:51:10,225 --> 00:51:12,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaijudo just says, yeah, the DLC sounds lame.

727
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:19,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe this begs the question, is this good news or is this bad news?

728
00:51:21,476 --> 00:51:23,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Age Awakening Dragon Age Awakening

729
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:51,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Fable

730
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:29,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Awakenings is closer to the model that PC games used in the 80s and 90s in that it was a proper expansion that was a good 20 or 30 hours of game which is about how long I spent on it with Dragon Age Origins before I played Awakenings I did go onto the Bioware store and buy some of their DLC and those were only like 2 or 3 hours long for 5 bucks but it was well done so they're not all terrible

731
00:52:30,858 --> 00:52:54,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Tetsuya says my brother was commenting to me about Nintendo not doing DLC said Nintendo should have made new tracks for Mario Kart and yeah I'm kind of like I would like to see Mario Kart 7 get more tracks download content you know as long as they don't go down that path that you know we talked about Ridge Racer on the Vita a couple weeks ago on the show like sounds like they're doing a horrible thing but like every Mario Kart game ever has had 32 tracks except I think

732
00:52:54,969 --> 00:53:00,512
[SPEAKER_09]: The Game Boy One you could unlock all of the tracks from the original in, which was a hell of a deal.

733
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,132
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

734
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:09,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But most Mario, you buy a Mario Kart game, you know you're going to get eight cups, four of them retro, four of them new, four, you know, it's like the same formula every time.

735
00:53:09,156 --> 00:53:12,998
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it would be pretty rad if some more of the retro levels came back as DLC.

736
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:17,260
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I would support that as long as it was reasonably priced.

737
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:19,281
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's got to be a limit to it.

738
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:20,202
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

739
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:22,531
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be interesting.

740
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:26,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think there's a lot of ways that Nintendo could do this very wrong too.

741
00:53:26,194 --> 00:53:30,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, pay to unlock content is the wrong way to do it.

742
00:53:30,968 --> 00:53:36,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Stuff that doesn't enhance stuff that's required for the core gaming experience would be bad.

743
00:53:36,872 --> 00:53:51,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, going down the same path, I got a story here about what's happening at the Wii U. The Wii U, obviously, not going to be out for a while, but some rumors out there that Nintendo is going to be doing a full-blown app store for the system.

744
00:53:51,902 --> 00:53:54,284
[SPEAKER_09]: So think like, you know, what iTunes has going on.

745
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:58,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, you know, they've got the eShop, they've got little stores that

746
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:19,182
[SPEAKER_09]: but the Wii U supposedly is going to go one step further there's going to be a wide variety of apps it will be stuff that will operate on the Wii U itself like TV things like you see on Xbox 360 Major League Baseball but some things that will run independently on the controller because the tablet obviously is its own little screen or what have you

747
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:19,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

748
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:44,206
[SPEAKER_09]: So my thought is, well, are you really downloading apps to your controller then?

749
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:48,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you downloading apps that just play on your controller, but you can't really take them portable?

750
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:53,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless something drastic has changed with the specs of the system, maybe they are giving that thing a little processor.

751
00:54:53,231 --> 00:54:53,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

752
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:57,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think they're not because they want to keep the costs down.

753
00:54:58,234 --> 00:54:58,475
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

754
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:27,656
[SPEAKER_09]: it would be interesting if that's happening but they are talking about you know check your email browse the web do Facebook and maybe some little games too on that little device I could see where you know you have the controller in your bedroom and it's streaming from the device in the living room and you can kind of like surf the web from bed and all that but I don't know most people have iPhones iPads Kindles you know other devices for that yeah so I don't know if the Wii U is necessary but I don't know what do you guys think

755
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:34,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see the advantage, especially if you just want one thing to give you all the convenience.

756
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:37,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So, maybe that's a good thing.

757
00:55:38,707 --> 00:55:43,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, it makes me think of that... What's that laptop that my husband wants?

758
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,190
[SPEAKER_06]: The Transformer.

759
00:55:44,891 --> 00:55:46,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you pull off the top and it's a tablet.

760
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:49,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it might be something to that extent.

761
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:52,455
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, say that you're...

762
00:55:53,836 --> 00:56:03,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's just a very domestic example, but say that your Wii is your way of surfing the web, and you're looking for a cake recipe.

763
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:07,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the cake recipe on your little tablet, take it to the kitchen, go make your cake.

764
00:56:08,623 --> 00:56:11,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm just using that as an example.

765
00:56:11,565 --> 00:56:12,445
[SPEAKER_09]: That would work.

766
00:56:12,986 --> 00:56:15,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see that in the little Nintendo promo they do.

767
00:56:15,627 --> 00:56:15,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

768
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:16,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Family Oriented Domestic Level

769
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:41,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why the chatters are doing this, but they're putting app in the names of all these Nintendo franchises like App Zero, the App of Zelda, App Icarus, App of Time, Excite App.

770
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:50,083
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the ones that was suggested by Giovedeo was App Crossing, and that made me think, oh God, there's where DLC could go really wrong, is Animal Crossing.

771
00:56:50,103 --> 00:56:50,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

772
00:56:50,823 --> 00:56:51,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.

773
00:56:51,763 --> 00:56:56,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it could be really good, but I could just see the easy cash-in on Animal Crossing.

774
00:56:56,905 --> 00:56:57,606
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

775
00:56:57,646 --> 00:57:02,427
[SPEAKER_06]: For Wii U, imagine Animal Crossing with Wii U. You can go to the island again.

776
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:03,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

777
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:04,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

778
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:06,787
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us news-wise?

779
00:57:30,171 --> 00:57:31,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a little something.

780
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's a cease and desist.

781
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:35,234
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies.

782
00:57:35,874 --> 00:57:37,675
[SPEAKER_06]: That's later story.

783
00:57:37,835 --> 00:57:41,517
[SPEAKER_09]: You will cease and desist that story right now.

784
00:57:41,577 --> 00:57:42,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I will.

785
00:57:42,518 --> 00:57:43,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the UK prices.

786
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:50,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, the European Union prices for the Vita and the memory cards and stuff.

787
00:57:51,242 --> 00:57:53,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's some of the game prices.

788
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:57,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncharted Golden Abyss will be €49.99 or £44.99.

789
00:57:57,246 --> 00:57:58,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Bond Nation Racer will be €39.99 or £34.99, respectively.

790
00:57:58,787 --> 00:58:00,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's Golf, the same.

791
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:01,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Wipeout, 2048, the same.

792
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Unit 13, also the same.

793
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:04,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Little Deviants will be €29.99 and £24.99.

794
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:06,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Reality Fighters is the same price as well.

795
00:58:21,222 --> 00:58:26,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So as far as the different bits that go with it, the 4 gig memory card will be $19.99, $17.99 pound.

796
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:27,368
[SPEAKER_06]: 8 gig will be $34.99 or $31.99.

797
00:58:27,408 --> 00:58:28,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 16 gig will be $49.99 and $44.99.

798
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of other stuff too, like the charger is $49.99 slash $44.99.

799
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,171
[SPEAKER_06]: All these different...

800
00:58:45,803 --> 00:58:48,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, England, why do you have to stick with the pounds?

801
00:58:48,844 --> 00:58:53,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, probably kind of a decent thing that they did given where the euro started going.

802
00:58:53,886 --> 00:58:59,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm actually trying to get the price of the system on here.

803
00:58:59,928 --> 00:59:02,129
[SPEAKER_09]: While that's loading, why don't I just jump in here real quick?

804
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:06,070
[SPEAKER_09]: In case you are wondering, you hadn't heard the US, American currencies.

805
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I did pull up Amazon real quick to just kind of...

806
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:12,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of what DarkSakura said, if you just replace Euro with dollars, it's pretty much the same thing.

807
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:15,776
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wi-Fi system itself, $249.99 in dollars.

808
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:18,578
[SPEAKER_09]: The first edition bundle is going to be $349.99.

809
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:20,380
[SPEAKER_09]: The games right now are all over the map.

810
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,700
[SPEAKER_09]: It just really depends on what the game is.

811
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Uncharted, $49.99.

812
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:23,221
[SPEAKER_09]: LittleBigPlanet, $39.99.

813
00:59:23,382 --> 00:59:24,402
[SPEAKER_09]: But like Hot Shots Golf...

814
00:59:28,385 --> 00:59:28,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Golf?

815
00:59:28,785 --> 00:59:29,346
[SPEAKER_09]: What is golf?

816
00:59:29,906 --> 00:59:30,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotshots Golf?

817
00:59:30,727 --> 00:59:31,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what GORF is.

818
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:32,548
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cool game.

819
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:33,469
[SPEAKER_09]: GORF is a cool game.

820
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:34,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotshots GORF.

821
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:35,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd buy that.

822
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:38,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotshots Golf, though, is $29.99, as is Wipeout 2048.

823
00:59:39,313 --> 00:59:42,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming maybe those games are a little... I don't know.

824
00:59:42,936 --> 00:59:43,537
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to tell.

825
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:45,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, Touch My Katamari is also $29.99.

826
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:47,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that indicative of the quality?

827
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

828
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:49,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope not.

829
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:52,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do have the list of the U.S.

830
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:53,864
[SPEAKER_06]: release titles, too.

831

[SPEAKER_06]: It actually says the full list from the U.S.

832
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:57,927
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation blog.

[SPEAKER_06]: On launch day, there will be Escape Plan, Hot Shots Golf World Invitational, Hustle Kings, Little Deviants, My Nation Racers, Road Trip, Super Stardust Delta, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Wipeout 2048, and as far as third-party stuff goes, just to look this over and point out the stuff that isn't absolute crap, as far as I know,

834
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:29,289
[SPEAKER_06]: BlazeBlue, ContinuumShift, Extend This is just a great name, Army Corps of Hell Luminous, Electronic Symphony Is that launch day or launch window?

835
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:34,073
[SPEAKER_06]: It says launch day What else is on here?

836
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:38,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants vs. Zombies Rayman Origins

[SPEAKER_06]: Touch of Space, Mutant Blobs, Touch My Katamari, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and as far as launch, Windows, Disgaea 3, Ridge Racer, Silent Hill Book of Memories.

838
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:57,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're seeing some stuff.

839
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Ninja Gaiden, is that Sigma?

840
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:01,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

841
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:04,756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually the Sigma symbol.

842
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:06,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I know my Greek.

843
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:07,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

844
01:01:08,326 --> 01:01:15,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so, yeah, Vita, I know I'm going to probably have to pick one up, now especially that I know Luminous is out Do you want to touch my Katamari?

845
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:36,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I will totally touch your Katamari, I'll only touch yours if you touch mine Okay Alan, I know you're probably not going to buy a Vita the day they come out because, you know, you'll play mine when I'm at work, but what do you think about You're going to touch his Katamari when he's at work Yeah, probably Are you excited about the release at all or are you just like, eh, whatever, another system

846
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:42,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard Vita has had some mixed stuff going on in Japan, that there's been a lot of bumps in the road.

847
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:56,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have the energy to stand or to be really fanatical about a system, but it took about two or three years, but the PSP, I thought, was a really good system, a really good handheld.

848
01:01:56,737 --> 01:01:56,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

849
01:01:58,438 --> 01:02:23,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that the PSP is underrated dare I say it because the DS which was phenomenal sort of steamrolled it which is a reality but I'm looking forward to the PSP Vita because I thought the PSP itself was damn good but I just financially and with the time I have towards games I can't really get all that excited about a launch day purchase like I would have been 10 years ago

850
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe for next Christmas though.

851
01:02:25,928 --> 01:02:27,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

852
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Once things get ironed out.

853
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:33,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, next Christmas I'll want a 3DS because if I'm doing things two years late, then I'll want... Oh, okay.

854
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:33,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

855
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:34,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to know.

856
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:34,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to know.

857
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I can start planning ahead.

858
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:36,883
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

859
01:02:37,243 --> 01:02:38,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's move on with some more news, Alan.

860
01:02:39,486 --> 01:02:40,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

861
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: He was basically answering speculation about a possible Metal Gear Solid remake because they are doing the HD remake for the PS3 of I believe it's Metal Gear Solid 2 and Snake Eater.

862
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,061
[SPEAKER_02]: But Metal Gear Solid, the original, isn't a part of it.

863
01:03:15,161 --> 01:03:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are like, well, obviously that was the most famous of the three because it was groundbreaking.

864
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:25,063
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably one of the best looking games during the entire PS1 life cycle.

865
01:03:25,823 --> 01:03:29,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean that they're going to be releasing one separately?

866
01:03:30,805 --> 01:03:35,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kojima has just said, you know, that ultimately it's Konami's decision.

867
01:03:37,048 --> 01:03:43,011
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to do a remake of it, that's fine, but he won't really, like, he doesn't care enough.

868
01:03:43,071 --> 01:03:46,473
[SPEAKER_02]: He thinks the game is perfect, or is good at it as is.

869
01:03:46,513 --> 01:03:49,794
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't think any corners were cut that he would want to go back and rewrite parts.

870
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:51,715
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought that the story was complete enough.

871
01:03:52,035 --> 01:03:53,096
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time it was told.

872
01:03:53,777 --> 01:04:01,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're welcome to do it, but Kojima's not really saying that he's psyched up about wanting to remake it.

873
01:04:03,448 --> 01:04:09,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think it's worth it for them to put the time and effort into remaking the first game?

874
01:04:09,653 --> 01:04:17,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I kind of get why they're doing that, because I think they're probably taking the easy way out with the 2 and 3 remakes, you know, just quickly up-rezzing.

875
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:23,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like with the God of War, which I know was Sony and not Konami, but it's just, they were already nice enough graphics that they could just upscale the textures.

876
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:25,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, which is probably what's happening with Silent Hill, too.

877
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:31,330
[SPEAKER_09]: But this, you know, going back and doing the first one would be, you know, they're not going to be able to do that as easy.

878
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't they kind of remake one already for the GameCube with Twin Snakes yes that was the script and the voice acting was changed a bit but it was still ultimately that game the story was retold

879
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:45,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really great.

880
01:04:45,357 --> 01:04:51,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I thought it was probably... Of course, we have just about every Metal Gear thing that comes out, so it was really great.

881
01:04:52,740 --> 01:05:03,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes for the GameCube, that's kind of like if they did an HD remake of Resident Evil when we have the Resident Evil remake on the GameCube.

882
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:05,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, totally different franchise, but it's the same thing.

883
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:08,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we've already kind of had that, so, you know...

884
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:15,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be real, if they remade Metal Gear Solid HD as a separate release, people would buy it.

885
01:05:16,006 --> 01:05:19,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So if Konami wants money, they should do it, but Kojima is just, you know...

886
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:24,482
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not... But a lot of people would rather they just put that effort into making a Metal Gear Solid 5.

887
01:05:25,103 --> 01:05:25,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

888
01:05:25,403 --> 01:05:28,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, story-wise... Which obviously you would want Kajima on board for that.

889
01:05:28,366 --> 01:05:28,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

890
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:30,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it'd be a new story.

891
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:31,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

892
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:33,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So... Alright.

893
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, moving on.

894
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:39,014
[SPEAKER_09]: It was brought up earlier in the show that Steam is having a crazy sale right now.

895
01:05:39,475 --> 01:05:42,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to just take some time to kind of talk about a lot of the crap that's on sale.

896
01:05:42,657 --> 01:05:43,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get Bastion.

897
01:05:43,658 --> 01:05:44,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still looking at him.

898
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,540
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

899
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:20,130
[SPEAKER_09]: What's also interesting is the competition that they're doing.

900
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's a competition.

901
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,411
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the right thing to call it?

902
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:26,072
[SPEAKER_09]: The achievements for loot, basically.

903
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:32,534
[SPEAKER_09]: They have these set achievements and with them you can win little coupons for games.

904
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:34,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I got a 75% off Left 4 Dead 2.

905
01:06:35,155 --> 01:06:38,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically like have the sale anytime you want type of thing.

906
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:59,754
[SPEAKER_09]: or you can get little pieces of coal and the little pieces of coal can either be contest entries into winning every game Steam has ever put out ever is the grand prize like you would never be able to play all that or I think you runner up prizes are like all the games on your wish list and like every Valve game ever made and you know things like that

907
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:04,037
[SPEAKER_09]: What's interesting, I was reading about this and something I wanted to bring up.

908
01:07:04,117 --> 01:07:05,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I just read about this today.

909
01:07:05,758 --> 01:07:10,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Steam ran out of the third party prizes.

910
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:14,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you get seven pieces of coal, you're only going to be able to get Valve stuff with that now.

911
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,765
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing third party you can get with that now.

912
01:07:17,606 --> 01:07:27,411
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a game, I'm blanking on what it was, that was released on Steam, I think it happened a year or two ago, where they ran out of the license, like the codes, like the CD key code.

913
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:28,711
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one of those digitally.

914
01:07:29,131 --> 01:07:34,254
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have, like they ran out, so they couldn't sell the game anymore because they didn't have the manufacturer's

915
01:07:35,354 --> 01:08:03,973
[SPEAKER_09]: so it's probably the same thing here they gave away the little free or the agreement was they would take the loss up to X many copies but a lot of people are upset because there's been those accounts out there that have kind of been abusing this we had a story a couple weeks ago about people were creating accounts just to trade the games and get the coupons kind of setting up all these sock accounts and Valve had to do this so a lot of people are kind of upset with the way this played out

916
01:08:04,853 --> 01:08:05,534
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

917
01:08:23,912 --> 01:08:25,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, you've been trying to save up coal.

918
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:27,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you going to cash it in?

919
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:28,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Now maybe not?

920
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:32,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I need two or three more, and I have no idea what is even available.

921
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:36,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it sounds like, thanks to this story, there's even less available for me to look at, so I'm even less motivated.

922
01:08:36,881 --> 01:08:38,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything Valve you don't own?

923
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:40,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Counter-Strike?

924
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:45,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Counter-Strike and just stuff that I don't care about because it's multiplayer or whatever.

925
01:08:45,426 --> 01:08:46,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

926
01:08:48,164 --> 01:09:09,731
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing, though, about this whole sale and these achievements is that it really shows how Valve works with the developers of these indie games, because especially with Toki Tori, whenever Valve has one of these sales on Steam, there will be several games that will get updates where the developers have designed Christmas content specifically for

927
01:09:11,641 --> 01:09:13,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam, which is unprecedented.

928
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:18,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And Toki Tori had, it was basically the first world, but it was all re-skinned with snow and Christmas trees.

929
01:09:19,044 --> 01:09:21,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So the developers went in and added that for this sale.

930
01:09:22,126 --> 01:09:23,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And Super Meat Boy, same thing.

931
01:09:23,266 --> 01:09:26,748
[SPEAKER_02]: There's now a Christmas world for this sale that you can go in and play.

932
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:28,689
[SPEAKER_09]: The one for Beat Hazard was mean.

933
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:34,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to play 10 minutes of Christmas music without dying or without losing.

934
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:37,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did it twice and lost at 9 minutes 30 seconds.

935
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:38,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so pissed.

936
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:42,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so even the developers of Beat Hazard were like, all right, there's a Christmas sale.

937
01:09:42,504 --> 01:09:44,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to add Christmas music.

938
01:09:45,406 --> 01:09:48,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Steam client will update the game automatically for this sale.

939
01:09:48,128 --> 01:09:51,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really think of any other example of when that's happened.

940
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:56,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, outside of Steam, yeah, but I was going to say the Portal 2 release.

941
01:09:56,913 --> 01:09:57,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember they had the whole...

942
01:09:58,314 --> 01:10:03,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Unlock Portal 2 early thing on Steam and they had special achievements and like Audiosurf.

943
01:10:03,778 --> 01:10:07,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I remember one day I went to go play Audiosurf and suddenly Portal 2 music just showed up.

944
01:10:08,221 --> 01:10:15,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I tried to play a song and it was like GLaDOS is taking over and suddenly it was a Portal 2 song that was really awesome.

945
01:10:16,227 --> 01:10:18,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like when they kind of do stuff like that.

946
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

947
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:27,835
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I like this comment from Derek H in chat, especially if the thing they are out of is digital and therefore not real.

948
01:10:28,035 --> 01:10:33,679
[SPEAKER_09]: That's frustrating, knowing that, oh, you just ran out of something that's on the internet.

949
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it needs a license, but yeah.

950
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:38,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um...

951
01:10:39,142 --> 01:10:43,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Licenses themselves are more for inventory and marketing purposes.

952
01:10:43,445 --> 01:10:45,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, my thought was that they just have an agreement with the developers.

953
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:49,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, hey, we're not going to give away unlimited amounts of 75% off your game.

954
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:52,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be limited to $100,000 or something like that.

955
01:10:53,352 --> 01:10:57,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for the sake of those third-party developers, many of them indie, I get it.

956
01:10:57,935 --> 01:10:58,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And I cut them some slack.

957
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:03,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever they sell, they have to report back to the manufacturer because they have those agreements.

958
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:04,379
Yeah.

959
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I love Derek Hage's follow-up comment.

960
01:11:07,123 --> 01:11:08,865
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like running out of birthday wishes.

961
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:13,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to wish you a happy birthday, but I used up my last one three days ago.

962
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:22,559
[SPEAKER_02]: When I woke up this morning, I had like five or six fucks to give, but now it's three o'clock and I don't give a fuck anymore.

963
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You missed.

964
01:11:23,539 --> 01:11:24,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You're too late.

965
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:27,583
[SPEAKER_02]: If you caught me a noon, I would have gave a fuck, but now I don't.

966
01:11:28,604 --> 01:11:32,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in chat says, clarifies the abusing of this.

967
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:37,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Sky, many people cheated and had multiple accounts on Steam to trade coals and stuff with themselves.

968
01:11:40,413 --> 01:11:41,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you need all these fake accounts?

969
01:11:41,754 --> 01:11:42,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a significant other.

970
01:11:43,015 --> 01:11:44,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan and I traded stuff.

971
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,161
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have any coal, you guys can have it.

972
01:11:49,742 --> 01:11:51,302
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing left to get with it.

973
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,544
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why I don't even do this shit.

974
01:11:54,404 --> 01:11:55,044
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously.

975
01:11:55,184 --> 01:11:56,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't sign up for any of it.

976
01:11:57,186 --> 01:11:57,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd do it.

977
01:11:58,246 --> 01:11:58,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know what?

978
01:11:58,946 --> 01:12:00,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I have other stuff to do.

979
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:03,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when I'm the winner of every Steam game ever...

980
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:04,569
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't play it.

981
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:08,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some of the achievements are have a wish list.

982
01:12:09,312 --> 01:12:11,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that your wish list has at least 10 things in it.

983
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:13,074
[SPEAKER_02]: That was worth a lump of coal.

984
01:12:13,114 --> 01:12:24,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you created 20 accounts and you added 10 games to your wish list, you could then pipe all of those other 19 other coals to your... So some of them weren't necessarily game achievements.

985
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:25,960
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just Steam interaction.

986
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then I'm sure I have a coal.

987
01:12:27,841 --> 01:12:28,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

988
01:12:29,522 --> 01:12:30,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too good for coal.

989
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,224
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?

990
01:12:31,945 --> 01:12:33,586
[SPEAKER_09]: You want diamonds.

991
01:12:33,787 --> 01:12:42,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what Sky's trying to say is that if you're forever alone.jpg the sale isn't for you then apparently because you need a partner to help you do this.

992
01:12:43,737 --> 01:12:45,099
[SPEAKER_02]: No forever alone on Steam.

993
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:50,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks are talking about Skyrim and I just wanted to say because this made me think about you've been playing Skyrim.

994
01:12:50,428 --> 01:12:51,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Challenge accepted.

995
01:12:51,269 --> 01:12:54,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaijudo in chat says, I want Skyrim on PC for the mods.

996
01:12:54,513 --> 01:12:55,494
[SPEAKER_09]: The mods are going to be sick.

997
01:12:56,855 --> 01:13:05,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing on PlayStation 3 and I've been watching Alan play it on PC and I'm like, now I kind of want it on PC because you had an inventory mod or something that...

998
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:11,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded a mod from Skyrim Nexus that basically makes managing your bag.

999
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:16,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sort by weight so I can see what all the heavy shit is that's weighing me down so I can get rid of it.

1000
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sort by weight.

1001
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:22,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sort by... Yeah, so it's an awesome add-on to make bag management in Skyrim awesome.

1002
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:23,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do that on PS3.

1003
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in chat says, Sky, you really have no idea.

1004
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:30,352
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people with over 100 multiple accounts.

1005
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:31,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Good thing they got banned.

1006
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:32,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, good thing they got banned.

1007
01:13:32,913 --> 01:13:33,973
[SPEAKER_09]: At least Valve banned them.

1008
01:13:34,554 --> 01:13:36,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Some companies may not have even caught it.

1009
01:13:36,474 --> 01:13:38,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, at least they got banned.

1010
01:13:38,435 --> 01:13:39,436
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I agree.

1011
01:13:40,056 --> 01:13:42,597
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't think Valve is the type of company, though.

1012
01:13:42,677 --> 01:13:44,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I just kind of look at their track record.

1013
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:46,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam overall has been a great thing for the community.

1014
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:47,179
[SPEAKER_09]: It really has.

1015
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:47,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1016
01:13:48,879 --> 01:14:05,924
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think in the long run they'll kind of look back at this and go okay next time we need to if we're going to give somebody coal for getting their wish list done we need to make it so that they can't trade that to somebody else who's already unlocked it for the same reason like they'll go back to the drawing board and I think they'll fix it for next time or they'll do something different you know

1017
01:14:06,364 --> 01:14:07,045
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll learn from it.

1018
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:07,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they will.

1019
01:14:07,925 --> 01:14:11,608
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does suck that it had its issues this time.

1020
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:13,930
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1021
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:15,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on with more news.

1022
01:14:17,032 --> 01:14:18,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh, we're having a long show.

1023
01:14:18,373 --> 01:14:20,995
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the story that I was going to read?

1024
01:14:21,135 --> 01:14:21,716
[SPEAKER_09]: How about it?

1025
01:14:21,876 --> 01:14:24,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I can lift that cease and desist order.

1026
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, it was Activision that put out the cease and desist on a dude who hacked Skylanders!

1027
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Spyro Adventures!

1028
01:14:35,294 --> 01:14:48,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, this guy named Brandon Wilson had hacked the game to where he basically figured out the conversation between the piece and the game so that he could basically mount any piece he wanted to in the game.

1029
01:14:49,484 --> 01:15:08,759
[SPEAKER_06]: and so uh so so he figured out how that little little uh um toy and portal magic portal were talking to each other yeah and he got he put it up on the internet which of course that's what they send out the cease and desist right and um he wrote out um a note that said you know what uh

1030
01:15:10,562 --> 01:15:12,003
[SPEAKER_06]: The accusations were inaccurate.

1031
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:13,984
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't really sharing them with other people.

1032
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:16,164
[SPEAKER_06]: He had them on a zip file for his own use.

1033
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:18,746
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't circumventing the game.

1034
01:15:19,366 --> 01:15:28,870
[SPEAKER_06]: He was basically just using stuff that was available, not using the hardware on an iOS device.

1035
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:31,711
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't really trick anything.

1036
01:15:32,331 --> 01:15:33,512
[SPEAKER_06]: He just figured it out.

1037
01:15:33,972 --> 01:15:34,672
[SPEAKER_06]: He just found it out.

1038
01:15:34,732 --> 01:15:35,953
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't actually use it.

1039
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:39,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, are you able to rip off Activision by doing this?

1040
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:43,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you can't just suddenly magically... You can't buy the figure.

1041
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:48,935
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just make the... If you use another system to make it think you have the figure.

1042
01:15:49,355 --> 01:15:51,736
[SPEAKER_09]: But doesn't... Isn't there still like a code for the DLC?

1043
01:15:51,816 --> 01:15:54,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you can't just magically download something that isn't there, right?

1044
01:15:54,497 --> 01:15:57,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, would you be able to exploit and steal money from Activision by doing this?

1045
01:15:57,838 --> 01:16:00,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is it just you figured out how magnets work?

1046
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you figure out how magnets work.

1047
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:10,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, isn't there inevitably going to be somebody that wants to know how the magician does the trick?

1048
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:12,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm double checking something on here.

1049
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:14,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, I just found out how they connect.

1050
01:16:16,795 --> 01:16:19,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to find where exactly he listed that.

1051
01:16:22,187 --> 01:16:24,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm asking Chatters because I have not played Skylanders yet.

1052
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:29,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So Chatters, do you have to have a code to get the DLC?

1053
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:30,651
[SPEAKER_06]: He uses RFID.

1054
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:37,074
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just playing to figure out how it worked.

1055
01:16:37,595 --> 01:16:39,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And he put up the way it worked.

1056
01:16:39,656 --> 01:16:44,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I guess maybe it's Activision is afraid that someone's going to use that to steal.

1057
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:44,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

1058
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:47,579
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean if the game is successful, people are going to try to rip it off?

1059
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,580
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's successful.

1060
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:48,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1061
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:51,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand it's been doing alright.

1062
01:16:53,971 --> 01:16:56,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

1063
01:16:57,432 --> 01:17:00,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he just got bored, figured it out, and saved the information for himself.

1064
01:17:01,373 --> 01:17:05,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Activision's like, oh my god, people are going to use it and steal from us.

1065
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:07,575
[SPEAKER_06]: All these five-year-olds with their toys.

1066
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:14,837
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, this talk of Skylanders makes me want a new version of Barcode Battler.

1067
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:19,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you could see how I just rolled my eyes.

1068
01:17:19,661 --> 01:17:20,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember those.

1069
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:25,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm subbing for Loki tonight, should I be throwing shit and screaming about Skylanders?

1070
01:17:25,525 --> 01:17:26,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're talking about it.

1071
01:17:26,586 --> 01:17:26,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it.

1072
01:17:26,826 --> 01:17:27,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

1073
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:29,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't throw anything because all the stuff near you is heavy.

1074
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:36,153
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was going to say, but this is, I wouldn't throw stuff in Dark Sakura's house either, but like everything that I would hit with is all stuff that we own.

1075
01:17:36,233 --> 01:17:39,695
[SPEAKER_02]: So Skylanders makes me very angry there.

1076
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:40,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my Loki.

1077
01:17:41,216 --> 01:17:42,997
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a pretty crappy impression.

1078
01:17:43,317 --> 01:17:44,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

1079
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:52,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks in chat aren't really able to answer the question about Skylanders, but I do see Derek H. says, well, of course there's a delay.

1080
01:17:52,483 --> 01:17:53,283
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a minute delay.

1081
01:17:53,704 --> 01:17:57,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Derek H. in chat says, so corporations are now trying to make it illegal to learn.

1082
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:01,344
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1083
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:25,484
[SPEAKER_09]: They've probably emulated it already or they have their competing version for their own franchise that's going to come out at the end of next year.

1084
01:18:26,545 --> 01:18:33,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the thing is, though, that if this somehow allows people to download free DLC, then that's going to be an issue.

1085
01:18:33,928 --> 01:18:41,633
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, if they didn't think that far ahead, then I don't want to say they deserve it, but they were asking for it.

1086
01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:43,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Hacker's going to hack, right?

1087
01:18:44,174 --> 01:18:45,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boo-hoo, go cry.

1088
01:18:47,196 --> 01:18:48,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Crimea River, Build a Bridge, and Get Over It.

1089
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:53,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm pretty sure those figures have to come with a code that you have to input to actually get the DLC.

1090
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:59,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, the figure just tells the portal, this is the one I want to use, or maybe we take it to friends' houses, whatever.

1091
01:18:59,847 --> 01:19:12,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if it works on just, you know, talking to... Because I think that that would make sense to not exactly have a code for it, but to have it just, you put the figure down and it connects.

1092
01:19:13,393 --> 01:19:16,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they might have been confident that no one would be able to figure it out.

1093
01:19:16,954 --> 01:19:19,575
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again... That was a dumb assumption.

1094
01:19:19,596 --> 01:19:21,396
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a stupid, stupid assumption.

1095
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:25,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many other video game companies have done the same thing is what I'm saying.

1096
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I don't want to say they deserved it.

1097
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:29,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Our security is foolproof.

1098
01:19:29,921 --> 01:19:35,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to say they deserved it in that case, but that wasn't a smart decision.

1099
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:35,464
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1100
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:38,006
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's been going around.

1101
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a common thing amongst developers.

1102
01:19:40,707 --> 01:19:41,948
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's going to figure this out.

1103
01:19:42,048 --> 01:19:45,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just be all confident and kiss our own asses.

1104
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:46,231
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1105
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:47,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1106
01:19:49,733 --> 01:19:50,053
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1107
01:19:50,549 --> 01:19:54,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming to a store near you.

1108
01:19:55,194 --> 01:19:56,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of don't think there's a lot this week.

1109
01:19:56,936 --> 01:19:57,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonder what that could be.

1110
01:19:57,857 --> 01:19:59,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it be that the holiday period's now over?

1111
01:20:00,961 --> 01:20:03,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see if there's anything after all.

1112
01:20:04,044 --> 01:20:05,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, you're filling in for Loki tonight.

1113
01:20:05,306 --> 01:20:06,467
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the US releases?

1114
01:20:07,324 --> 01:20:17,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to the source that we use, it looks like there's one solitary, sad little game coming out this week.

1115
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:25,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to pick up next week, I believe on the 10th, as some of the 2012 Q1 releases are coming out.

1116
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially towards the 31st.

1117
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:29,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you have a couple big ones on the 31st.

1118
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:29,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1119
01:20:30,103 --> 01:20:35,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Between now and the next episode of OLR, we have Anarchy Reigns for the 360, and that is it.

1120
01:20:35,908 --> 01:20:37,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the game is.

1121
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:38,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I couldn't tell you a thing about it.

1122
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:41,012
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1123
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:50,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to Japan to look at... Well, I'm not going there physically, but I'm going to look at their releases of things that are coming out, and I gotta tell you, I don't see a damn thing coming out in Japan.

1124
01:20:50,519 --> 01:20:55,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking quickly to see if even the 3DS... Well, don't they have any Week 2 Vita stuff, or did it just have its...

1125
01:20:56,664 --> 01:20:57,545
[SPEAKER_09]: 3DS is outselling it already in week 2

1126
01:21:16,244 --> 01:21:17,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in chat was saying that.

1127
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:17,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Ranma.

1128
01:21:18,027 --> 01:21:19,488
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like LOL at Vita.

1129
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:26,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this was the 3DS's strategy the whole time.

1130
01:21:26,498 --> 01:21:27,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, right.

1131
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:32,746
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever it is, it'll be interesting to see if the numbers are the same here.

1132
01:21:33,386 --> 01:21:35,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be all fanboy and root for one or the other.

1133
01:21:35,889 --> 01:21:39,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm interested in both, but it's certainly not a good sign.

1134
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:53,886
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the technology of what the Vita has feature-wise and what it's trying to do versus the 3DS, which is just, hey, it's a polarized 3D screen that you don't need glasses for, I think the Vita is trying to accomplish more with the technology that's in it.

1135
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:56,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, sometimes that just goes to show.

1136
01:21:57,148 --> 01:22:02,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Bleeding Edge Technology, and, you know, the perks aren't necessarily what move the system.

1137
01:22:02,811 --> 01:22:03,151
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1138
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:06,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no releases in Japan this week, so how about Europe?

1139
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:12,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to quote a line from one of my favorite movies, Spaceballs, we ain't found shit.

1140
01:22:14,276 --> 01:22:14,596
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1141
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,657
[SPEAKER_09]: A very slow release.

1142
01:22:17,017 --> 01:22:17,978
[SPEAKER_09]: One game coming out in the entire world.

1143
01:22:17,998 --> 01:22:20,559
[SPEAKER_06]: A game that I personally don't give a crap about is coming out on the 10th.

1144
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:21,079
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1145
01:22:21,419 --> 01:22:22,860
[SPEAKER_06]: That Gotham City Impostors...

1146
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:25,581
[SPEAKER_09]: What is your hatred for Gotham City Imposters?

1147
01:22:25,661 --> 01:22:27,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked silly, silly cute.

1148
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:29,745
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of part of my problem.

1149
01:22:29,885 --> 01:22:32,427
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, it's a bunch of wannabes.

1150
01:22:32,908 --> 01:22:33,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1151
01:22:33,569 --> 01:22:36,391
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to play a wannabe, I'll just play DC Universe Online.

1152
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:40,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't follow that.

1153
01:22:40,595 --> 01:22:41,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't follow that.

1154
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:46,003
[SPEAKER_09]: DC Universe was definitely not wow.

1155
01:22:46,103 --> 01:22:52,226
[SPEAKER_09]: DC Universe felt more like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the arcade game than it did wow.

1156
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:00,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate the controller so much.

1157
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:04,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're not into that, then of course you're not going to be into DC Universe.

1158
01:23:04,273 --> 01:23:05,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate the camera.

1159
01:23:05,674 --> 01:23:08,316
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought PvP was a lot of fun in DC Universe.

1160
01:23:08,956 --> 01:23:09,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say.

1161
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:11,238
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're not a player versus player kind of person.

1162
01:23:11,438 --> 01:23:11,918
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

1163
01:23:12,438 --> 01:23:13,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I will dabble in it.

1164
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:14,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll experiment with PvP.

1165
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:20,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And to expand on my previous statement, and if I want to play a superhero game, I'll go back and play City of Heroes.

1166
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:21,545
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fair.

1167
01:23:21,825 --> 01:23:27,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I want to play a game by that company, I'll just play Star Trek Online.

1168
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I'm going to once it's free.

1169
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:31,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that later this month?

1170
01:23:31,692 --> 01:23:32,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes it is.

1171
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:40,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been reading on the Road to F2P blog that every time they do an expansion or something it's Road to whatever.

1172
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:46,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So now they've got number 25 of the Road to F2P expansion.

1173
01:23:48,288 --> 01:23:50,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Blog going on, so I'm pretty excited.

1174
01:23:51,009 --> 01:23:53,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, of course, you've ruffled the feathers of our chatroom, DarkSakura.

1175
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit.

1176
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:58,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad from PogCulture says, Oh, no, she didn't.

1177
01:23:59,112 --> 01:23:59,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes, I did.

1178
01:24:00,712 --> 01:24:04,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Tigerclaw says, Gotham City Imposters looks amusing.

1179
01:24:04,314 --> 01:24:08,415
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a bunch of people in bad cosplay costumes shooting at each other.

1180
01:24:08,895 --> 01:24:10,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, yes.

1181
01:24:11,256 --> 01:24:14,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I want bad cosplay, I'll go to Fonamay.

1182
01:24:15,896 --> 01:24:17,777
[SPEAKER_06]: where there's occasionally some good cosplay.

1183
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:27,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Derek H has drawn a line in the sand and says City of Heroes is a lot crappier than DC Universe Online.

1184
01:24:27,883 --> 01:24:28,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has better control.

1185
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:30,144
[SPEAKER_09]: And better camera.

1186
01:24:30,304 --> 01:24:34,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, you were a City of Heroes stand for quite some time.

1187
01:24:34,226 --> 01:24:37,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played it for like 20 minutes just yesterday.

1188
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:39,209
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free to play now.

1189
01:24:39,789 --> 01:24:43,351
[SPEAKER_02]: City of Heroes has a very strong RP community and it's still kicking.

1190
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, City of Heroes is...

1191
01:24:45,812 --> 01:24:52,815
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're not into RP, like, I don't know, when I listen to Dead Pixel Live and what I know of Derek H, he doesn't strike me as somebody that's really into RP.

1192
01:24:52,835 --> 01:24:54,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he might.

1193
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,817
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be like a, you know, the secret lives of, you know, dot, dot, dot.

1194
01:24:57,857 --> 01:24:59,578
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just don't get that.

1195
01:24:59,838 --> 01:25:00,978
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why he plays games.

1196
01:25:00,998 --> 01:25:07,501
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, my favorite thing to do, though, was in City of Heroes, make costumes, which is actually the same thing that the only thing I like doing in DC Universe.

1197
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So why aren't you playing Barbie, the game?

1198
01:25:11,437 --> 01:25:12,819
[SPEAKER_06]: You should see how I play Sims.

1199
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:19,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I spend all my Sim game building the damn house and deciding what they're gonna look like.

1200
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,073
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you fucking do in the Sims is you build a house.

1201
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:25,338
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't do any of the get married and have babies shit.

1202
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:31,274
[SPEAKER_06]: If I do anything, it's go sit in the park and play guitar and get a lot of money and then go home.

1203
01:25:32,355 --> 01:25:33,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Hack computer, go home.

1204
01:25:33,976 --> 01:25:36,058
[SPEAKER_09]: You are living out your fantasies of being a bum.

1205
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:37,800
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you're doing in The Sims.

1206
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,902
[SPEAKER_09]: You are living out your fantasies of being a bum.

1207
01:25:40,522 --> 01:25:40,822
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1208
01:25:42,524 --> 01:25:43,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that in real life.

1209
01:25:43,545 --> 01:25:44,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm unemployed.

1210
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:47,148
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1211
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1212
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:50,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Funemployed, funemployed.

1213
01:25:51,071 --> 01:25:51,452
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1214
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the fandom community for those games is still going strong, and a group called... You forgot Quest for Glory.

1215
01:26:18,836 --> 01:26:20,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Quest for Glory came later.

1216
01:26:20,477 --> 01:26:21,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, judging you so hard right now.

1217
01:26:21,678 --> 01:26:22,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that series, too.

1218
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:30,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Infamous-Adventures.com just released their HD fan community remake of Space Quest II.

1219
01:26:31,742 --> 01:26:34,744
[SPEAKER_02]: VOHAL's Revenge, the original, came out in 1987.

1220
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:42,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Quest only had two games that were the really blocky 16-color EGA graphics.

1221
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:43,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you smirking?

1222
01:26:43,509 --> 01:26:44,169
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to say?

1223
01:26:44,469 --> 01:26:45,110
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm looking at chat.

1224
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:45,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not smirking at you.

1225
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:46,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at chat.

1226
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:46,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise.

1227
01:26:49,557 --> 01:27:14,620
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Space Quest 3, the Pirates of Pestilon had a graphical update or like it just it looked even though it was still text-based but yeah Space Quest 2 is probably the probably the best one of the whole franchise to be honest or at least before they went to point and click it took them five years to get this out there but yeah it looks like on the 30th of December just two days ago

1228
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:16,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It's final.

1229
01:27:16,782 --> 01:27:23,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play Space Quest 2 with updated graphics due to the fans that go through and revamp this stuff.

1230
01:27:23,468 --> 01:27:27,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I would really suggest if you are interested in this at all, you grab it now.

1231
01:27:27,151 --> 01:27:27,812
[SPEAKER_09]: It's free, right?

1232
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:28,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1233
01:27:28,272 --> 01:27:35,739
[SPEAKER_09]: You should probably grab it now because as soon as everybody gets back to work on Monday and the lawyers are back at work, there'll be a cease and desist letter.

1234
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:36,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Any predictions?

1235
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:37,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow?

1236
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:37,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Tuesday?

1237
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:39,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get cease and desisted?

1238
01:27:39,582 --> 01:27:40,403
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

1239
01:27:40,483 --> 01:27:40,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by...

1240
01:27:42,385 --> 01:27:43,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Monday 5 o'clock.

1241
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:53,959
[SPEAKER_02]: See, there's a different community that remade King's Quest 3 and I think 4, Perils of Rosella, which I think when I sat in for DarkSakura was my pick for classic game.

1242
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are still up there.

1243
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:56,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Those didn't get C&D'd.

1244
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:57,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1245
01:27:58,204 --> 01:27:59,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what about the whole Silver Lining thing?

1246
01:27:59,945 --> 01:28:02,907
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a new property, I think is why.

1247
01:28:02,967 --> 01:28:05,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Telltale Games is getting a new property.

1248
01:28:05,409 --> 01:28:17,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and at the time, we didn't know that King's Quest had been handed off and there's going to be a new one coming out from Telltale, and Silver Lining went through this whole ugly thing where it was like, yes, you can do the game as a fan game.

1249
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,220
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't do it at all.

1250
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yes, you can do it, but it can't say King's Quest on it.

1251
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, finally it fucking came out, but...

1252
01:28:26,558 --> 01:28:31,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of look at what happened to the silver lining and I'm like, this is not going to last.

1253
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:37,817
[SPEAKER_02]: There are fan remakes of some of the original King's Quest games that I know are still out there that have been out for a year more.

1254
01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:44,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, King's Quest is Roberta and Ken Williams and Space Quest is the two guys from Andromeda, Mark and Scott.

1255
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:46,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And Roberta don't give a fuck anymore.

1256
01:28:47,339 --> 01:28:49,160
[SPEAKER_09]: She has said fuck off to the game industry.

1257
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,820
[SPEAKER_02]: She lives in a cabin in the Yosemite.

1258
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:55,581
[SPEAKER_09]: She has accomplished the American dream of living in a fort and get off her property.

1259
01:28:56,741 --> 01:28:57,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless her heart.

1260
01:28:57,782 --> 01:28:58,042
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

1261
01:29:00,282 --> 01:29:01,583
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that she did Kingsway.

1262
01:29:01,623 --> 01:29:02,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody else owns it now.

1263
01:29:02,623 --> 01:29:03,243
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a prize.

1264
01:29:03,323 --> 01:29:06,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably why she bought a fort.

1265
01:29:07,445 --> 01:29:08,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not lying.

1266
01:29:08,245 --> 01:29:14,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that she does live in an outwood type of thing.

1267
01:29:14,428 --> 01:29:16,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Space Quest 2 definitely improved on the first one.

1268
01:29:16,929 --> 01:29:17,809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard as hell.

1269
01:29:18,289 --> 01:29:19,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's text-based.

1270
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:21,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Save often, because you will die.

1271
01:29:21,971 --> 01:29:29,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's possible, like with some of the other Sierra games, to save your game past a point where you didn't pick up the item that you need.

1272
01:29:30,234 --> 01:29:32,155
[SPEAKER_09]: to beat the puzzle and you literally have to start over.

1273
01:29:33,296 --> 01:29:36,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to be clear when I joke about the whole cease and desist thing.

1274
01:29:36,978 --> 01:29:39,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to see this thing get ceased and desisted.

1275
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:42,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a great, you know, imitation is the finest form of flattery.

1276
01:29:43,102 --> 01:29:48,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously people have very big spaces in their hearts for these types of games of yesteryear.

1277
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:51,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I will probably fucking download this and play it because I used to love these games.

1278
01:29:52,707 --> 01:29:56,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I was more of a King's Quest person than a Space Quest, but nonetheless, I'll still play it and check it out.

1279
01:29:57,289 --> 01:30:04,851
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also, unfortunately, am all too familiar with the business side of things and how these things tend to get shut down, so we'll see.

1280
01:30:04,891 --> 01:30:13,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just this last year, Streets of Rage got the Super Hela fan remake, and that was 1, 2, and 3, plus a bunch of extra fan-added crap.

1281
01:30:13,873 --> 01:30:17,234
[SPEAKER_02]: That was up for a week before Sega was like, uh-uh, nope.

1282
01:30:17,674 --> 01:30:19,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Take the hint, game companies.

1283
01:30:19,475 --> 01:30:23,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I realize Telltale's like kind of trying to crank those out and that's kind of their niche now.

1284
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:26,681
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, they can't do everything.

1285
01:30:28,942 --> 01:30:31,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe people want to see a new game.

1286
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:31,825
[SPEAKER_02]: They can try.

1287
01:30:32,605 --> 01:30:35,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Vivendi Activision that I think has the Sierra properties.

1288
01:30:35,908 --> 01:30:39,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say I am stupid excited for a new King's Quest game from Telltale.

1289
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:39,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to rock.

1290
01:30:39,971 --> 01:30:40,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1291
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:43,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just, you know, please don't let me down with this Telltale.

1292
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:45,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, please don't let me down with it.

1293
01:30:46,563 --> 01:30:49,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I have high hopes for that.

1294
01:30:49,405 --> 01:30:52,607
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a series that has been gone from the gaming community far too long.

1295
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:53,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It's King's Quest.

1296
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:55,690
[SPEAKER_09]: These other games too.

1297
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:59,232
[SPEAKER_02]: King's Quest VIII, Mask of Eternity was a horrible nightmare and never really happened.

1298
01:31:00,733 --> 01:31:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have moved into a fort too if I had put that game out.

1299
01:31:03,895 --> 01:31:04,396
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't her.

1300
01:31:04,976 --> 01:31:05,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was.

1301
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:09,178
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Mask of Eternity was developed by... She had nothing to do with King's Quest?

1302
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:11,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought she still kind of oversaw it.

1303
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:13,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Her name was just on it because she invented Graham.

1304
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:18,723
[SPEAKER_02]: The plot of it was about some knight arriving in Daventry and becoming king after King Graham.

1305
01:31:19,603 --> 01:31:27,346
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole style of it, because it was like ISO view 3D where you like... It was like an action game.

1306
01:31:27,747 --> 01:31:29,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awful is what it was.

1307
01:31:30,008 --> 01:31:31,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, no, that wasn't Roberta Williams.

1308
01:31:31,908 --> 01:31:32,989
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1309
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:37,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought for some reason she had something to do with it, but maybe it's just because she invented King's Quest and all.

1310
01:31:38,502 --> 01:31:39,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, moving on.

1311
01:31:41,124 --> 01:31:43,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Some stuff that is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1312
01:31:43,446 --> 01:31:51,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to all these different ratings boards around the world, we know some of the games that will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade within the next year.

1313
01:31:51,411 --> 01:31:52,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some interesting things that are on here.

1314
01:31:53,352 --> 01:32:17,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, AMY, Babel Rising, Bang Bang Racing, Deep Black Episode 1 and 2, Defenders of Ardania, Dungeon Fighter Live, Happy Action Theater, Haunt, I Am Alive, uh, Nexuiz, Quarrel, Rayman 3, Hoodlum Havoc, Retro City Rampage, that's that Grand Theft Auto-y type game, uh, Saints Row Money Shot, a spin-off game that apparently-

1315
01:32:17,769 --> 01:32:26,153
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I was reading about this game, it's some type of little mini game where you play the bullet and you try to go through as many things as possible as the bullet.

1316
01:32:26,534 --> 01:32:28,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds very over the top and very Saints Row.

1317
01:32:28,895 --> 01:32:42,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Scary Girl, Shank 2, The Simpsons Arcade Game that had been leaked earlier, Sign Mora, Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Episode 2, Spelunky, Tetris Party Challenge, Warp, World Gone Sour, and Reketeer.

1318
01:32:43,162 --> 01:32:47,144
[SPEAKER_09]: That is like a compilation of everything over the past few months that has been leaked and

1319
01:32:47,384 --> 01:32:49,206
[SPEAKER_09]: from ratings boards and other websites.

1320
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:52,148
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the roster will look like for 2012.

1321
01:32:52,188 --> 01:32:55,451
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good six months of releases right there, I'm sure.

1322
01:32:55,992 --> 01:32:57,593
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1323
01:32:59,335 --> 01:33:03,839
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, we've been talking a lot about classic games and indie games and so forth.

1324
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,141
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to take a step back in time.

1325
01:33:08,376 --> 01:33:14,337
[SPEAKER_09]: to a simpler time when there was no DLC or patches for games.

1326
01:33:14,417 --> 01:33:16,238
[SPEAKER_09]: If the game was broke, it was just broke.

1327
01:33:17,538 --> 01:33:19,138
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura's picked a broken game.

1328
01:33:19,178 --> 01:33:19,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

1329
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:21,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a little broken sometimes.

1330
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:24,339
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura's picked a mighty fine game as a classic game of the week.

1331
01:33:24,379 --> 01:33:31,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I understand tonight, kind of a nod to, you know, I don't usually pick these kind of games, but dot, dot, dot, right?

1332
01:33:31,921 --> 01:33:36,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, it was one that I found myself enjoying quite a bit when it came out.

1333
01:33:36,322 --> 01:33:36,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1334
01:33:37,382 --> 01:33:40,266
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be surprising to a lot of people, even though I've brought it up before.

1335
01:33:40,966 --> 01:33:43,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And the game is WWF WrestleMania 2000 for Nintendo 64.

1336
01:33:48,047 --> 01:33:50,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I said it.

1337
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:51,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked it.

1338
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:54,073
[SPEAKER_06]: With its bad guitar synthesizer sound.

1339
01:33:55,855 --> 01:33:58,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it came out in 1999.

1340
01:33:59,278 --> 01:34:02,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually came out in 2000 in Japan for Nintendo 64.

1341
01:34:02,821 --> 01:34:06,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It was based off of their annual pay-per-view event.

1342
01:34:07,245 --> 01:34:12,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, this was when I was watching WWF regularly.

1343
01:34:13,271 --> 01:34:15,935
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, during their whole attitude thing.

1344
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:22,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the NWO and... This was in China.

1345
01:34:22,766 --> 01:34:23,627
[SPEAKER_06]: China, yeah.

1346
01:34:23,728 --> 01:34:25,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, that one was a mess.

1347
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:28,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a big China fan at the time.

1348
01:34:29,986 --> 01:34:41,209
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, back when everyone was laughing because Stephanie McMahon got boob implants, like, and you could totally tell the difference between one episode and the next.

1349
01:34:42,469 --> 01:34:53,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, all the best divas coming out at the time, you still had Fabulous Moolah and what was her name?

1350
01:34:54,592 --> 01:34:57,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Mae... Mae, what's her name?

1351
01:34:58,814 --> 01:34:59,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Her buddy.

1352
01:35:00,055 --> 01:35:02,996
[SPEAKER_06]: They were both fantastic wrestlers in their day.

1353
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:05,417
[SPEAKER_09]: You're asking the wrong people wrestling trivia.

1354
01:35:05,777 --> 01:35:07,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Mae Young.

1355
01:35:07,598 --> 01:35:08,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Mae Young.

1356
01:35:09,299 --> 01:35:10,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would threaten to show her puppies.

1357
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:15,222
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the best era of wrestling ever.

1358
01:35:15,282 --> 01:35:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: You had Test back in the day and you had the Hardy Boys and...

1359
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember his name either.

1360
01:35:25,782 --> 01:35:26,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Kidman.

1361
01:35:27,343 --> 01:35:28,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember his last name.

1362
01:35:28,385 --> 01:35:30,827
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like the time that I would totally be into wrestling.

1363
01:35:30,988 --> 01:35:33,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan and I were both watching it and we loved it.

1364
01:35:33,951 --> 01:35:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So when this game came out and everyone's like, this is the best wrestling game ever.

1365
01:35:38,115 --> 01:35:38,876
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta get it.

1366
01:35:38,936 --> 01:35:39,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess who got it?

1367
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:40,738
[SPEAKER_06]: That was us.

1368
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:42,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1369
01:35:45,934 --> 01:35:50,596
[SPEAKER_06]: When it came out, it actually had this amazing story mode.

1370
01:35:50,996 --> 01:35:54,958
[SPEAKER_06]: You had Royal Rumble, you had King of the Ring, you had the pay-per-views.

1371
01:35:55,879 --> 01:36:03,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And the story modes were like watching the TV episodes, all the steroidal man drama you could handle.

1372
01:36:04,242 --> 01:36:10,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Because honestly, I think that wrestling is soap operas for straight dudes.

1373
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:17,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the chatters are chiming in.

1374
01:36:17,494 --> 01:36:18,974
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a little bit delayed here.

1375
01:36:19,415 --> 01:36:27,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Mae Young, Ivory, Tori, not Tori Wilson, Lita, Billy Kidman, Attitude Era, Reality Era.

1376
01:36:27,898 --> 01:36:28,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1377
01:36:29,398 --> 01:36:36,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And you also had a lot of stuff going on with Steve Austin, so there was that going on too.

1378
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:36,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1379
01:36:36,721 --> 01:36:38,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I have never played this game, but I'm loving in the background.

1380
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:39,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I see some of the signs.

1381
01:36:39,944 --> 01:36:41,845
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the signs says, China, suck it.

1382
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:44,047
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1383
01:36:44,427 --> 01:36:50,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hugely into WWF at the time, like all 80s kids were.

1384
01:36:50,611 --> 01:36:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a part where I think half of it was that I kind of grew out of it.

1385
01:36:55,995 --> 01:36:59,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember it was Roddy Piper versus Hulk Hogan.

1386
01:36:59,558 --> 01:37:00,279
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the big...

1387
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:24,202
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the big war of good and evil was Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan and then a lot of the major characters left and it was Stone Cold Steve Austin that brought it back from the doldrums because they had an icon again that they could you know he was awesome but by then I think I had outgrown it I remember playing some of the PS1 wrestling games that were good though

1388
01:37:24,522 --> 01:37:25,864
[SPEAKER_06]: www.DarkSakura.com

1389
01:37:35,504 --> 01:38:04,913
[SPEAKER_06]: who because what happens I think is that they save the same engine and use it for like whatever the fire pro wrestling and the various ones over there but it had all the signature moves and you could do custom stage entrance when you did the creative character so you could actually design everything that happened when they come out into the ring you could choose their starting music and it would actually have loops of some of the

1390
01:38:05,573 --> 01:38:06,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan and I made this guy.

1391
01:38:19,491 --> 01:38:21,793
[SPEAKER_06]: D-Generation X D-Generation X

1392
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:48,213
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was just so super fun.

1393
01:38:48,233 --> 01:38:58,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a really fun game but like some of the characters in it you had the Road Warriors and Hulk Hogan and Taka Michinoku who was a legend in Japan.

1394
01:38:58,267 --> 01:39:00,470
[SPEAKER_06]: He did not get enough nods over here.

1395
01:39:01,932 --> 01:39:15,001
[SPEAKER_06]: You could actually create some of the WCW characters because I believe it was THQ, but they had the same... They had done the other games too.

1396
01:39:15,461 --> 01:39:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could actually recreate Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall.

1397
01:39:19,644 --> 01:39:21,205
[SPEAKER_06]: You could even make Macho Man.

1398
01:39:21,225 --> 01:39:22,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe...

1399
01:39:24,213 --> 01:39:37,872
[SPEAKER_06]: There were... If you had two... If you were doing a tag team match and you actually picked people who were on the same team, it would, you know, have them be introduced under their team name instead of just their individual names.

1400
01:39:38,753 --> 01:39:39,254
[SPEAKER_06]: You had...

1401
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:42,031
[SPEAKER_06]: All kinds of stuff.

1402
01:39:42,051 --> 01:39:49,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you could also do Hell in a Cell and you could do... I don't think you could do... I don't remember if the Ladders, Tables, and Chairs matches were in it at the time.

1403
01:39:50,194 --> 01:39:54,036
[SPEAKER_06]: But those were pretty fun too.

1404
01:39:54,757 --> 01:40:00,760
[SPEAKER_06]: The commercials, I remember they were funny too because you had The Rock doing Christmas themed ads.

1405
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Kane was in it.

1406
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Underfaker.

1407
01:40:04,241 --> 01:40:05,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the Underbiker.

1408
01:40:05,482 --> 01:40:06,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the Undertaker.

1409
01:40:06,862 --> 01:40:07,002
Yeah.

1410
01:40:08,183 --> 01:40:09,024
[SPEAKER_06]: He's still around, right?

1411
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:10,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's still doing it.

1412
01:40:10,205 --> 01:40:14,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, because that man's had knee surgery and back surgery and everything else surgery.

1413
01:40:14,868 --> 01:40:16,249
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what was the best about this?

1414
01:40:16,669 --> 01:40:17,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It had mankind in it.

1415
01:40:19,171 --> 01:40:19,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

1416
01:40:19,451 --> 01:40:19,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember him.

1417
01:40:21,052 --> 01:40:21,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Mick Foley.

1418
01:40:21,833 --> 01:40:22,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1419
01:40:22,253 --> 01:40:23,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Socko.

1420
01:40:24,605 --> 01:40:30,248
[SPEAKER_06]: He would put a dirty sock on his hand with a mouth drawn on it and shove it in people's mouths.

1421
01:40:30,929 --> 01:40:32,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, even I remember that.

1422
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:34,030
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

1423
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:35,651
[SPEAKER_09]: That man's insane.

1424
01:40:35,831 --> 01:40:47,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to learn wrestling because one night... I know this was the doing of Travis and Jessica over at Under Station Live because we used to all do Rocky Horror in Sacramento together.

1425
01:40:47,918 --> 01:40:49,479
[SPEAKER_09]: We did a wrestling night one night.

1426
01:40:49,499 --> 01:40:53,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who suggested that was, but I somehow think Jessica was a part of it.

1427
01:40:53,141 --> 01:40:53,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.

1428
01:40:53,741 --> 01:41:04,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember she was heavily involved in that but I had to learn wrestling because I had to play one of the characters because we did we played wrestling people in Rocky Horror

1429
01:41:06,861 --> 01:41:09,102
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the invention of the metal bull bra, wasn't it?

1430
01:41:09,202 --> 01:41:09,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it was.

1431
01:41:09,742 --> 01:41:13,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I was supposed to be Steve McMahon, the owner guy, as Riff Raff.

1432
01:41:13,904 --> 01:41:14,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Vince.

1433
01:41:14,705 --> 01:41:15,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Vince.

1434
01:41:15,085 --> 01:41:15,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Vince McMahon.

1435
01:41:15,765 --> 01:41:16,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I was Vince McMahon.

1436
01:41:17,026 --> 01:41:17,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1437
01:41:17,486 --> 01:41:18,806
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I didn't say Ed McMahon.

1438
01:41:19,407 --> 01:41:21,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I was Vince McMahon as Riff Raff.

1439
01:41:21,467 --> 01:41:22,428
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun.

1440
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:26,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I had the sister or daughter or something that was Magenta.

1441
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:27,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Stephanie McMahon.

1442
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:28,330
[SPEAKER_09]: With the boobs.

1443
01:41:28,651 --> 01:41:30,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were Riff Raff and Magenta in the movie.

1444
01:41:30,992 --> 01:41:31,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1445
01:41:31,932 --> 01:41:32,573
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty funny.

1446
01:41:32,793 --> 01:41:34,514
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're into Rocky Horror, it was really funny.

1447
01:41:34,594 --> 01:41:41,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, seriously, one of the most fun fucking shows we ever did because we actually had our own TLC match.

1448
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:42,800
[SPEAKER_09]: It was tables, ladders, and cookie sheets.

1449
01:41:44,221 --> 01:41:44,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Ow.

1450
01:41:44,582 --> 01:41:46,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hit my head on your counter.

1451
01:41:48,124 --> 01:41:52,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sitting in front of the bar and we had a fucking table and a ladder and a cookie sheet.

1452
01:41:54,113 --> 01:41:54,754
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1453
01:41:55,454 --> 01:42:07,964
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I miss the Deadly Boys, because they would actually set... They used to be in ECW, which was like the really hardcore wrestling association, and they would just set tables on fire and throw each other through it.

1454
01:42:08,804 --> 01:42:09,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, anyway.

1455
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:10,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, back to games.

1456
01:42:10,966 --> 01:42:12,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to say about this game?

1457
01:42:12,967 --> 01:42:21,270
[SPEAKER_06]: You could get special copies that had a special hologram card with it that had different pictures of in-game action like an intro to a finish.

1458
01:42:22,591 --> 01:42:29,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I mean, it was just an awesome game and it had everything at the time that you would expect to see on TV.

1459
01:42:29,213 --> 01:42:30,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, the music was kind of crap.

1460
01:42:32,194 --> 01:42:33,095
[SPEAKER_06]: But who cares?

1461
01:42:33,235 --> 01:42:33,835
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

1462
01:42:34,516 --> 01:42:38,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, Dan and I would spend hours making a character.

1463
01:42:39,999 --> 01:42:42,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And then watch him play.

1464
01:42:42,341 --> 01:42:43,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Just watch him play.

1465
01:42:43,061 --> 01:42:47,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we had that one dude who was in purple and lime green who beat everybody.

1466
01:42:50,046 --> 01:42:52,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think he had like Shawn Michaels hair.

1467
01:42:53,768 --> 01:42:54,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So he had a mullet.

1468
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:56,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1469
01:42:57,131 --> 01:42:58,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else to say about Rasslin'?

1470
01:42:59,605 --> 01:43:01,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed when wrestling was good.

1471
01:43:01,687 --> 01:43:02,748
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

1472
01:43:02,768 --> 01:43:04,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the chatters would say it's still good.

1473
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:07,171
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1474
01:43:07,272 --> 01:43:07,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan?

1475
01:43:07,692 --> 01:43:10,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say you don't like John Cena.

1476
01:43:10,534 --> 01:43:11,435
[SPEAKER_02]: The John Cena era.

1477
01:43:11,495 --> 01:43:12,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I like John Cena.

1478
01:43:12,556 --> 01:43:13,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like John Cena.

1479
01:43:13,877 --> 01:43:17,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say I like him because he doesn't look over-rewarded.

1480
01:43:18,261 --> 01:43:19,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's actually good.

1481
01:43:19,522 --> 01:43:22,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked The Rock because he wasn't acting then.

1482
01:43:25,046 --> 01:43:26,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick, name a good movie with The Rock in it.

1483
01:43:27,895 --> 01:43:28,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do it.

1484
01:43:28,515 --> 01:43:31,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Doom.

1485
01:43:31,337 --> 01:43:33,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually going to say The Mummy 2.

1486
01:43:34,498 --> 01:43:37,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he was in it for five seconds and he was CG'd.

1487
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I did like Scorpion King for the rest of it.

1488
01:43:39,441 --> 01:43:39,641
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

1489
01:43:39,661 --> 01:43:41,582
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Classic Game of the Week.

1490
01:43:43,743 --> 01:43:44,883
[SPEAKER_06]: That man looks good in tight pants.

1491
01:43:45,243 --> 01:43:46,004
[SPEAKER_09]: WWF.

1492
01:43:46,444 --> 01:43:48,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because it was the WWF back then.

1493
01:43:48,345 --> 01:43:50,306
[SPEAKER_09]: WrestleMania 2000 on the Nintendo 64.

1494
01:43:50,346 --> 01:43:51,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw those pandas.

1495
01:43:53,653 --> 01:43:55,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to take a break.

1496
01:43:55,174 --> 01:44:04,202
[SPEAKER_09]: When we come back, we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the all-important, the moment you've been waiting for all night, I'm sure, Game of the Year 2011 discussion.

1497
01:44:04,402 --> 01:44:05,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what DarkSakura's going to pick.

1498
01:44:05,683 --> 01:44:06,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what Alan's going to pick.

1499
01:44:07,025 --> 01:44:08,806
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know what I'm going to pick.

1500
01:44:08,846 --> 01:44:10,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan thinks he knows, but maybe I changed my mind.

1501
01:44:11,408 --> 01:44:13,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm worried at least one or two of ours will be the same.

1502
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:14,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see.

1503
01:44:14,271 --> 01:44:16,993
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay because, you know, there is no right or wrong answer.

1504
01:44:17,433 --> 01:44:18,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, your picks for Game of the Week.

1505
01:44:18,894 --> 01:44:24,259
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to come up with the OLR Game of the Year for 2011 all when we come back.

1506
01:44:24,619 --> 01:44:25,300
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be surprised.

1507
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:25,960
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1508
01:44:26,561 --> 01:44:27,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you might not be.

1509
01:44:27,581 --> 01:44:28,002
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1510
01:44:28,382 --> 01:44:31,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1511
01:44:31,444 --> 01:44:31,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned.

1512
01:44:38,243 --> 01:44:40,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1513
01:44:40,764 --> 01:44:43,685
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live on this 1st of January.

1514
01:44:43,765 --> 01:44:50,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy New Year 2012 with the 440th episode of our show from the new studio setup.

1515
01:44:50,246 --> 01:44:54,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, if everything's been done right, you shouldn't really be able to tell at all that it's a new setup.

1516
01:44:55,508 --> 01:44:59,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob Roberts, of course, here with you with DarkSakura and Alan tonight filling in for Loki.

1517
01:45:00,174 --> 01:45:00,714
[SPEAKER_06]: It occurred to me.

1518
01:45:01,034 --> 01:45:05,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize why we have less background noise and extra reverberation.

1519
01:45:05,497 --> 01:45:05,837
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1520
01:45:06,037 --> 01:45:06,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Carpet.

1521
01:45:07,297 --> 01:45:11,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a big part of it is that you don't have the sound bouncing everywhere.

1522
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,441
[SPEAKER_09]: The way it's partitioned is differently too.

1523
01:45:14,481 --> 01:45:15,901
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just setups are going to be weird.

1524
01:45:17,582 --> 01:45:42,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Loki, of course, will be back next week I don't want anyone thinking funny business is going on But it is technically a holiday And he, like many other people, has to go back to work tomorrow So I think there's a dinner thingy going on tonight that he's at So he'll be back next week to talk Game of the Year with us But the three of us that are here tonight will get into our Game of the Year picks here shortly But first, we've got to talk about some rapid-fire news So, Alan, since you're filling in for Loki tonight, why don't you start us off?

1525
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,117
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, it was a slow news week, so there's kind of some less stories than we usually have, just so you know.

1526
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:59,543
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an MMO coming out in China, I believe, called The Age of Wulin.

1527
01:46:00,243 --> 01:46:12,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And a certain gentleman who wants to play this game very much went to an auction being held by the developers, Snail Games, and basically he bought an online item for his character.

1528
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:16,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Once this game comes out, he's going to have some epic god-tier sword.

1529
01:46:17,313 --> 01:46:24,358
[SPEAKER_02]: for his character that he spent US dollar equivalent $16,000 for.

1530
01:46:25,639 --> 01:46:34,085
[SPEAKER_02]: For a weapon for his toon in a game that no one knows if it's even a good game or not.

1531
01:46:34,165 --> 01:46:40,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, looking at the screenshot, and I think this is the official Age of Woolen trailer, it's on YouTube.

1532
01:46:41,411 --> 01:46:42,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty.

1533
01:46:42,892 --> 01:46:47,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So Vish, I mean, obviously it's not some back alley studio that is making an ugly game.

1534
01:46:47,815 --> 01:46:48,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty.

1535
01:46:48,275 --> 01:46:50,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, $16,000 for an epic item.

1536
01:46:51,137 --> 01:46:57,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Also at this auction, they sold a sheath, meaning not a weapon.

1537
01:46:57,841 --> 01:47:02,543
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the thing that you put your weapon in for your character for the Hook of Departure for $1,600.

1538
01:47:04,104 --> 01:47:06,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And another sheath for the Lordly Spear.

1539
01:47:09,247 --> 01:47:09,467
[SPEAKER_02]: for $2,500.

1540
01:47:09,967 --> 01:47:15,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he get his name in the game or any special thing for spending this much money?

1541
01:47:15,731 --> 01:47:17,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

1542
01:47:17,272 --> 01:47:27,799
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard of people spending a lot of money on an eBay auction because they can win a role in the game or the money goes to charity or something, but this doesn't appear to be the case, does it?

1543
01:47:27,839 --> 01:47:33,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like... I would hope that this item would be bound to his account so whatever character he rolls can use it.

1544
01:47:33,783 --> 01:47:36,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he'll be able to kick everyone's ass in PvP.

1545
01:47:36,385 --> 01:47:37,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know enough about the game.

1546
01:47:38,486 --> 01:47:40,447
[SPEAKER_02]: to know what this is going to do for him.

1547
01:47:40,627 --> 01:47:53,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks like he received a commemorative plaque with his name engraved on it by Snail Games saying, you know, thou own this sword and you're awesome because you gave us 16 grand for it.

1548
01:47:54,315 --> 01:47:55,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a one-of-a-kind item.

1549
01:47:55,616 --> 01:48:02,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So the graphic, I guess, of visually the texture of how the sword looks and its name and its stats, he's the only one in the whole system that's going to have it.

1550
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:05,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So his EP will be even bigger.

1551
01:48:05,382 --> 01:48:05,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1552
01:48:06,997 --> 01:48:07,478
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1553
01:48:07,638 --> 01:48:11,502
[SPEAKER_06]: When I would do stuff like that for my private servers on Ragnarok Online, I would pay $5.

1554
01:48:16,178 --> 01:48:43,095
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was into City of Heroes I would buy their costume packs which was about three to six bucks for like mutant because you know when City of Heroes like DarkSakura was saying there are millions of combinations of costumes for your character some of them were DLC so I've spent money I've race changed I've race changed my Bane and WoW I'm just not going to spend what you could buy a automobile for

1555
01:48:44,216 --> 01:48:45,217
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1556
01:49:14,054 --> 01:49:22,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope Star Wars does legitimately, you know, even though I say two games can coexist, I do hope the two games can kind of tug and pull from each other a little bit.

1557
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll help us all in the long run.

1558
01:49:24,801 --> 01:49:28,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the record, all the cryptic points, I did a lot of that in Star Trek Online.

1559
01:49:29,064 --> 01:49:31,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I have a defiant retrofit.

1560
01:49:32,907 --> 01:49:48,341
[SPEAKER_02]: and it looks like this game in China is entering open beta this spring I should sign up for it and it looks like we are getting it here in the US but it still needs to be put through open beta in China so I don't think there's really a due date on when we're going to get it here soon

1561
01:49:48,721 --> 01:49:50,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Ragnarok Online in Korean.

1562
01:49:51,522 --> 01:49:52,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So did I. I remember that.

1563
01:49:53,383 --> 01:49:55,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, Jamie, what do I do here?

1564
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:56,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, what do I do here?

1565
01:49:56,925 --> 01:49:59,106
[SPEAKER_06]: You played with me on the American one.

1566
01:49:59,346 --> 01:50:00,167
[SPEAKER_06]: On the American beta.

1567
01:50:00,607 --> 01:50:03,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember a translation patch for the Korean.

1568
01:50:04,089 --> 01:50:07,150
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a translation patch because some of the NPCs were still in Korean.

1569
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:09,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1570
01:50:09,871 --> 01:50:11,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Then alright, I played that one.

1571
01:50:11,652 --> 01:50:13,053
[SPEAKER_06]: But I played the Korean one before that.

1572
01:50:14,065 --> 01:50:16,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, it wasn't that great.

1573
01:50:16,686 --> 01:50:17,306
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

1574
01:50:17,486 --> 01:50:27,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And this article does make a brief mention of the wank over Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, which of course was the game that came out before Skyrim, which is making a lot of game of the year lists right now.

1575
01:50:28,208 --> 01:50:34,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Oblivion had DLC where you could make pretty armor for your horse that literally did nothing.

1576
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:35,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just...

1577
01:50:36,010 --> 01:51:01,754
[SPEAKER_09]: you know metal for your horse I kind of think the gaming community just needs to let that go like I understand that that is the quintessential like thing that people will point out for DLC but also at the same time Bethesda has come out the industry has learned from that mistake though that we will not do that again that was you know you know what nobody was fucking doing it then and we did it and we learned you know so okay kind of a break yeah anyhow what else you have for us

1578
01:51:04,396 --> 01:51:05,216
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I have for you?

1579
01:51:05,516 --> 01:51:05,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1580
01:51:08,117 --> 01:51:13,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirated games via torrents or Usenet or whatever.

1581
01:51:14,038 --> 01:51:18,599
[SPEAKER_02]: The Torrent Freak, which is a big torrent, sort of underground torrent news site.

1582
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:27,141
[SPEAKER_02]: If a torrent site gets raided, like the Pirate Bay, if they ever get raided, Torrent Freak is usually the site that reports on it, you know, like journalistically.

1583
01:51:27,721 --> 01:51:33,502
[SPEAKER_02]: They have compiled lists of the top pirated games via piracy.

1584
01:51:35,283 --> 01:51:37,624
[SPEAKER_02]: by digital torrent download.

1585
01:51:39,305 --> 01:51:46,889
[SPEAKER_02]: For PC, we've got Crysis 2, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, no surprise there, would have been probably number one if it came out earlier in the year.

1586
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:50,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Top Wii game downloads, Galaxy 2.

1587
01:51:51,752 --> 01:51:57,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Sports Mix, surprisingly, and Xenoblade Chronicles, which is... What the hell is... Oh, Super Mario Galaxy 2.

1588
01:51:57,175 --> 01:51:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry, Super Mario Galaxy 2.

1589
01:51:59,597 --> 01:52:00,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Sports Mix.

1590
01:52:00,918 --> 01:52:19,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And number three is interesting, Xenoblade Chronicles, which you would think would be a no-one-curr game, but it's an issue of... It was translated in English for the Europe market, and according to this, the tally, 950,000 confirmed downloads via the various torrents that you could get this game on.

1591
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:30,192
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's a thing where if Nintendo didn't have their head up their ass and put that out here then maybe that number... But they are going to put it out here, Alan.

1592
01:52:30,212 --> 01:52:31,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, too little too late.

1593
01:52:31,572 --> 01:52:43,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone here who wanted it either bought it and paid the 90 bucks to import it for their modded Wii from London or wherever their UK retailer is or they pirated it.

1594
01:52:45,375 --> 01:52:46,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course Modern Warfare 3...

1595
01:52:48,983 --> 01:52:57,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Access isn't a problem there because it's, you know, America is the biggest market for that game and it's just people don't want to pay 60 bucks for it.

1596
01:52:57,366 --> 01:52:59,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes it's just an issue of people being cheap.

1597
01:53:00,807 --> 01:53:01,107
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1598
01:53:01,167 --> 01:53:08,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, and then top 360 pirated downloads via BitTorrent, Gears of War 3, no surprise there.

1599
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:11,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, number two, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

1600
01:53:12,171 --> 01:53:14,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the, mostly the big multiplayer games.

1601
01:53:15,813 --> 01:53:16,133
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1602
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,235
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1603
01:53:36,524 --> 01:53:38,086
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about it here on this show before.

1604
01:53:38,146 --> 01:53:40,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, we don't support it either here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1605
01:53:41,429 --> 01:53:43,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like the number of people that are supporting it are dropping.

1606
01:53:44,131 --> 01:53:46,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, I don't think I need to touch on it here.

1607
01:53:46,273 --> 01:53:47,934
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't really directly relate to video games.

1608
01:53:48,254 --> 01:53:51,477
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure you've all heard about what GoDaddy's been going through with this whole thing.

1609
01:53:51,537 --> 01:53:59,364
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously, they had quite a number of embarrassing PR stumbles where I think you were hearing the Benny Hill theme playing in the background with every press release.

1610
01:53:59,924 --> 01:54:06,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the good news is that Nintendo, Sony, and EA have all as well dropped SOPA support.

1611
01:54:07,449 --> 01:54:13,553
[SPEAKER_09]: An update to the government's list of SOPA supporters show that the names are now no longer on there.

1612
01:54:13,994 --> 01:54:16,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, there is no word as to why.

1613
01:54:17,076 --> 01:54:29,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it because they saw the tech community backlash to what happened to GoDaddy, or maybe that whole debacle made them rethink the position, or maybe they just realized finally it was not a good idea?

1614
01:54:30,944 --> 01:54:37,426
[SPEAKER_09]: For whatever the reason, it's a relief to see these gaming companies are finally dropping out and taking their names off the list.

1615
01:54:37,846 --> 01:54:38,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray!

1616
01:54:39,607 --> 01:54:41,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more rumors are floating around about Epic Mickey 2.

1617
01:54:42,628 --> 01:54:50,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you might remember there was an earlier rumor based on a survey that had been out there, some type of focus group thing that had people choosing the box art.

1618
01:54:50,490 --> 01:54:56,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the rumors are circulating again this week because I guess there was an online newsletter that Disney put out that just flat out said,

1619
01:54:56,992 --> 01:55:02,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic Mickey 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii in fall of 2012.

1620
01:55:03,557 --> 01:55:13,784
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember the original Epic Mickey game was a Wii exclusive, but maybe because of that or what, it didn't sell maybe as much as it could have.

1621
01:55:14,184 --> 01:55:17,586
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's kind of interesting in a way that it is getting a sequel after all.

1622
01:55:18,267 --> 01:55:25,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Supposedly the sequel, Epic Mickey 2, will also have co-op play, including two-player split-screen, which is something we don't see in games all the time anymore.

1623
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:26,092
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

1624
01:55:51,775 --> 01:55:55,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, there's a fun little game that I just purchased today called Bastion.

1625
01:55:56,697 --> 01:56:01,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently other people have decided to buy it as well because it exceeded $500,000.

1626
01:56:02,219 --> 01:56:04,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's an indie game.

1627
01:56:04,439 --> 01:56:08,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it's really catching on, don't you think?

1628
01:56:09,641 --> 01:56:13,743
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, that's with Steam and Xbox Live Arcade sales.

1629
01:56:14,323 --> 01:56:15,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And my apologies, I didn't mean dollars.

1630
01:56:15,923 --> 01:56:17,104
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 500,000 copies sold.

1631
01:56:17,124 --> 01:56:17,504
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies.

1632
01:56:21,446 --> 01:56:22,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, good game.

1633
01:56:22,866 --> 01:56:24,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people think so.

1634
01:56:24,347 --> 01:56:27,789
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, with some of the deals on Steam and so forth, I'm surprised it's not higher.

1635
01:56:28,089 --> 01:56:28,949
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a quality game.

1636
01:56:29,029 --> 01:56:32,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's, you know, the story is also like from what, a couple days ago?

1637
01:56:32,791 --> 01:56:34,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, who knows, who knows.

1638
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:37,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just exceeded that, so.

1639
01:56:38,234 --> 01:56:42,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, a really, really hard NES game has been translated into English.

1640
01:56:43,396 --> 01:56:45,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's called Takeshi's Challenge.

1641
01:56:45,717 --> 01:56:49,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And to quote the article here, the game was made by the devil.

1642
01:56:51,932 --> 01:57:14,155
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the Ram modders King Mike has translated it into English so you can play it is it like Beat Takeshi the guy that was in Battle Royale I want to think so actually I'm pretty sure that it is but I can find out I am though very sure that it is from Beat Takeshi very cool

1643
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:18,906
[SPEAKER_09]: and he has the show that's been ripped off here as Wipeout, right?

1644
01:57:21,388 --> 01:57:25,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Takeshi's Castle and they had the dubs that were on here in the States.

1645
01:57:25,352 --> 01:57:25,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that a thing?

1646
01:57:25,933 --> 01:57:27,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that still on?

1647
01:57:27,895 --> 01:57:33,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was Takeshi's Castle and it was the ultimate challenge, blah, blah.

1648
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:35,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.

1649
01:57:36,563 --> 01:57:36,883
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1650
01:57:37,263 --> 01:57:37,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

1651
01:57:38,244 --> 01:57:38,424
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1652
01:57:40,047 --> 01:57:46,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Takeshi no Chosenjo And it is Beat Takeshi Takeshi Kitano Nice

1653
01:57:48,553 --> 01:57:53,776
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, before we get into some more news, the time has come for you to lip sync.

1654
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:54,797
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just kidding.

1655
01:57:55,077 --> 01:57:58,019
[SPEAKER_09]: For us to talk about the Game of the Year of 2011.

1656
01:57:58,919 --> 01:58:03,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to go around the table and see what we here at OLR thought was the Game of the Year.

1657
01:58:03,542 --> 01:58:04,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to start with the community.

1658
01:58:04,963 --> 01:58:06,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, it's a show where every gamer has a voice.

1659
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:13,969
[SPEAKER_09]: And earlier this week on Facebook and Google+, in our communities there, we asked you guys, what do you think is the Game of the Year?

1660
01:58:14,589 --> 01:58:34,154
[SPEAKER_09]: and I wanted to make sure this is important you guys understand there's no right or wrong answer the whole point of the show here is that it's where every gamer has a voice and everybody's into something different people can only afford sometimes to buy the games that were from last year or you know not everybody is necessarily into RPGs or shooters or racers

1661
01:58:34,514 --> 01:58:48,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this is important to really just kind of open it up to actual gamers that are enthusiastic enough to be listening to a podcast and fan their page, yet may not necessarily find the same critical darlings to be as successful.

1662
01:58:48,941 --> 01:58:50,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe they did.

1663
01:58:50,122 --> 01:58:54,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sometimes what the critics pick really is the cream of the crop.

1664
01:58:54,624 --> 01:58:55,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's see.

1665
01:58:55,204 --> 01:58:58,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start with the community first and see what some of you guys out there said.

1666
01:58:59,406 --> 01:59:02,790
[SPEAKER_09]: was the absolute bestest game to come out in 2011.

1667
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:04,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I'm sorry, that you played in 2011.

1668
01:59:04,411 --> 01:59:07,294
[SPEAKER_09]: It may have been a game that actually came out previously.

1669
01:59:07,314 --> 01:59:14,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, God, there'll probably be some games I don't get to play until 2012 because 2011 was so crowded with so many good releases.

1670
01:59:15,843 --> 01:59:17,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I also start off by saying

1671
01:59:18,206 --> 01:59:18,727
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1672
01:59:35,942 --> 01:59:39,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember looking back at last year going, this was the best year ever for games.

1673
01:59:39,865 --> 01:59:42,668
[SPEAKER_09]: But this year was really, really, really good.

1674
01:59:43,148 --> 01:59:44,790
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here's some of what you guys picked.

1675
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:50,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Over on Facebook, Zether said, number three, Mario Kart 7, the best one.

1676
01:59:50,414 --> 01:59:54,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, Saints Row the Third, wacky, insane, better than Grand Theft Auto 4 in every way.

1677
01:59:55,239 --> 02:00:00,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And his number one game of the year is Portal 2, an excellent follow-up with a very good single-player campaign and solid co-op.

1678
02:00:01,364 --> 02:00:26,382
[SPEAKER_09]: John Keegan said I shouldn't say the full last name sorry John K said over on Facebook best 2011 game Arkham City based on the variety of missions and improvement on an already awesome original otherwise I played older games in 2011 of which Assassin's Creed 2 and Uncharted 2 topped the charts based on awesome story and solid gameplay Derek W said

1716
02:02:32,182 --> 02:02:35,004

[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, Bastion.

1724
02:02:56,518 --> 02:02:59,579
[SPEAKER_09]: The narration makes what would be a pretty good action game a great one.

1725
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,741
[SPEAKER_09]: The narration adds a story that is full and vibrant and memorable.

1726
02:03:05,183 --> 02:03:08,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Miguel I says, Portal 2, best sequel ever.

1727
02:03:09,767 --> 02:03:11,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Forza 4, best driving game to date.

1728
02:03:12,150 --> 02:03:14,792

[SPEAKER_09]: Jim H says, Infamous 2 improves on everything from the first game and the user generated content was a great addition.

[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, LittleBigPlanet 2 improves

1732
02:03:27,984 --> 02:03:32,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other year, the sequel to one of my all-time favorite games that improves on the original would be my number one.

1733
02:03:33,267 --> 02:03:34,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And number one was Portal 2.

1734
02:03:35,629 --> 02:03:38,450
[SPEAKER_09]: He picked all twos for his top list.

1735
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:43,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Sticking with the theme, it's an improvement on the original, has some of the best storytelling and voice acting in gaming history.

1736
02:03:44,114 --> 02:03:46,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Add in the great gameplay, and it makes it the game of the year.

1737
02:03:47,616 --> 02:03:51,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me quickly run over to Google+, because we had a few responses over there as well.

1738
02:03:51,898 --> 02:04:06,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to read for you guys and we had from DeadPixelLive commented F1 2011 Forza 4 and Pinball FX 2 F1 2011 because it did what a sports sequel is supposed to do leave the good stuff in and add more good stuff

1739
02:04:07,583 --> 02:04:16,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Forza 4 because the rival mode made driving and competing fun, and Pinball FX 2 because at the end of the year I realized I had played it more than all my other games.

1740
02:04:16,896 --> 02:04:17,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Good reason.

1741
02:04:18,658 --> 02:04:19,780
[SPEAKER_09]: We have another response here.

1742
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:23,244
[SPEAKER_09]: It's written in Russian, so I'm not sure how to say this, so I apologize.

1743
02:04:23,685 --> 02:04:24,726
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, do you read Russian?

1744
02:04:25,647 --> 02:04:25,907
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1745
02:04:26,288 --> 02:04:29,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so just pipe it through Google Translate.

1746
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:32,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So, unfortunately, name I can't read.

1747
02:04:32,171 --> 02:04:32,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1748
02:04:33,012 --> 02:04:33,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Ignorant American.

1749
02:04:34,873 --> 02:04:40,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Says, number one, Deus Ex, Human Revolution for a great cyberpunk story and enjoyable gameplay.

1750
02:04:40,896 --> 02:04:41,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad Extro is not here.

1751
02:04:41,797 --> 02:04:42,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Extro can read Russian.

1752
02:04:43,018 --> 02:04:44,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Little known fact about Extro.

1753
02:04:44,218 --> 02:04:45,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when he was learning.

1754
02:04:45,219 --> 02:04:46,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I remember that, too.

1755
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:46,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to Nelly.

1756
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, Bastion.

1757
02:04:48,301 --> 02:04:50,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because Loki's wife is Russian.

1758
02:04:50,442 --> 02:04:54,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remembered all of the cards all over your apartment, and I almost learned to read Russian, too.

1759
02:04:55,525 --> 02:04:57,446
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd think I'd know more after living there.

1760
02:04:58,186 --> 02:05:02,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, number two, Bastion for very polished representation, great music, and awesome narration.

1761
02:05:03,108 --> 02:05:09,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And number three, The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings for old school hardcore RPG brought up to the next level on every aspect.

1762
02:05:10,090 --> 02:05:15,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, Wendy S says, number three, Battlefield 3, favorite shooter, love the way they did multiplayer.

1763
02:05:15,731 --> 02:05:16,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, NHL 12...

1764
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:18,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Favorite sports game?

1765
02:05:18,592 --> 02:05:20,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Realistic simulation of hockey but not inaccessible.

1766
02:05:20,973 --> 02:05:25,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And number one, Portal 2 drew me in like nothing else could.

1767
02:05:26,035 --> 02:05:28,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are some of the responses from Facebook and Google+.

1768
02:05:29,636 --> 02:05:30,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Very diverse.

1769
02:05:30,416 --> 02:05:32,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you guys catch that?

1770
02:05:32,777 --> 02:05:35,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but I put a game on my list that they didn't.

1771
02:05:36,198 --> 02:05:37,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1772
02:05:37,219 --> 02:05:40,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're about to get to that here in a minute.

1773
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:42,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to quickly see if I could bring this up.

1774
02:05:44,422 --> 02:05:57,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to put it in the link or in the show role because over on NeoGAF, there's a thread where they're actually tracking what the media, all the different gaming outlets are naming as the game of the year.

1775
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:59,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So I kind of wanted to give you an idea.

1776
02:06:00,669 --> 02:06:17,514
[SPEAKER_09]: What they were saying, kind of what the rest of the internet is saying, or what the critics are saying and so forth Let's see, I'll have to try and dig for this a little bit here Any games that the chatters mentioned that you were like, oh I forgot about that game

1777
02:06:18,519 --> 02:06:19,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no.

1778
02:06:20,982 --> 02:06:22,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they all like Angry Birds, apparently.

1779
02:06:23,325 --> 02:06:25,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anybody said Angry Birds, actually.

1780
02:06:25,407 --> 02:06:25,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

1781
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I found it.

1782
02:06:26,809 --> 02:06:27,870
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is from NeoGaf.

1783
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:30,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to the folks over there that tallied this all together.

[SPEAKER_09]: Two said Deus Ex Human Resolution Two said L.A.

[SPEAKER_09]: Noire Again, surprised I didn't hear that from any of the chatters either Two said Star Wars The Old Republic Two said Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP and a handful of other games got a mention as well So

1791
02:07:14,207 --> 02:07:15,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares about what the media thinks?

1792
02:07:16,851 --> 02:07:18,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about what we think.

1793
02:07:29,247 --> 02:07:30,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Skyrim Why did you pick Skyrim?

1794
02:07:56,025 --> 02:08:13,329
[SPEAKER_02]: it tries to do something that a lot of game developers are afraid to do Bethesda rather the makers of Skyrim ever since the original two Elder Scrolls games which most people haven't played Arena and I'm blanking on what the second one was

1795
02:08:16,111 --> 02:08:30,307
[SPEAKER_02]: they're sandbox games before Grand Theft Auto which is where that genre and that term sandbox game came from so you can literally do anything if you want to make a plate wearing warrior who casts

1796
02:08:31,968 --> 02:08:59,179
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go exploring for hours ignore the main plot completely and still have stuff to do Bethesda with Morrowind and Oblivion and now Skyrim that's always been their thing to make this really immersive almost impossible to complete game and Skyrim is the best attempt at it yet where even I know people in real life that have played Morrowind and Oblivion and it was such a burden all this openness

1797
02:09:00,459 --> 02:09:26,000
[SPEAKER_02]: they hated it and Skyrim there's something about it where they get better each time in streamlining that combination of keeping your attention plus holy shit this is a whole huge world to dink around in visually it is gorgeous it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played especially on my PC which is now four years old and yeah it's for a for you know kind of a

1798
02:09:28,567 --> 02:09:34,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I get really into exploration and min-maxing stats and doing crafting and Skyrim has all of that.

1799
02:09:34,944 --> 02:09:36,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great game.

1800
02:09:36,593 --> 02:09:43,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, is it just me, or for a game as vast as Skyrim, we really need a new fucking mem besides this arrow to the knee shit?

1801
02:09:45,362 --> 02:09:56,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get that until I finally was in a town, and I heard some dude, I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee, and I was like, oh, thank you, it's something that some dude says to you.

1802
02:09:56,453 --> 02:09:57,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I finally get that man.

1803
02:09:57,795 --> 02:09:58,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1804
02:09:59,096 --> 02:10:28,560
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it was from the game but it's like with a game so fucking huge like seriously there has to be something else the 50,000 cheese wheels off the mountain was funnier than an arrow to the knee I'm sorry there's a great picture of the the um the aural of Whiterun the first king that you meet where someone had stacked hundreds of like carrots apples cabbages all over him and they took a picture and he's got his chin on his fist like a thinking man on his throne being all kingly and he's just surrounded by like cabbages it's awesome

1805
02:10:29,855 --> 02:10:30,115
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1806
02:10:30,856 --> 02:10:33,737
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what is your number three pick for Game of the Year?

1807
02:10:34,777 --> 02:10:35,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Batman Arkham City.

1808
02:10:36,258 --> 02:10:37,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Batman Arkham City.

1809
02:10:37,099 --> 02:10:38,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did you pick Batman Arkham City?

1810
02:10:38,819 --> 02:10:43,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, and I honestly didn't play it, but I watched Dan play it most of the time.

1811
02:10:44,122 --> 02:10:45,723
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just sit back and it's like watching a movie.

1812
02:10:46,043 --> 02:10:46,263
Really?

1813
02:10:46,603 --> 02:10:49,345
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what happens when you're married or in a committed relationship.

1814
02:10:49,385 --> 02:10:51,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you let the other person do the driving.

1815
02:10:51,165 --> 02:10:51,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

1816
02:10:51,486 --> 02:10:55,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, we've done that for tons of games between the two of us.

1817
02:10:55,368 --> 02:10:59,650
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I just sit back and I totally dig the character designs.

1818
02:11:00,330 --> 02:11:02,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that they got Penguin right.

1819
02:11:03,372 --> 02:11:06,213
[SPEAKER_06]: That he's this British gangster kind of guy, you know.

1820
02:11:07,354 --> 02:11:09,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And Catwoman was absolute hotness.

1821
02:11:11,015 --> 02:11:15,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it is physically impossible to leap around like you do in four-inch heels, just saying.

1822
02:11:17,344 --> 02:11:19,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Hamill's last performance as Joker.

1823
02:11:35,362 --> 02:11:35,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1824
02:11:35,903 --> 02:11:36,743
[SPEAKER_06]: No, officially.

1825
02:11:37,784 --> 02:11:46,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then they went and teased Arkham World and you're like... He said on Twitter that he would come back specifically for a Killing Joke animated special.

1826
02:11:46,933 --> 02:11:50,337
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's interesting.

1827
02:11:50,617 --> 02:11:51,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw enough money at him, he'll do it.

1828
02:11:52,058 --> 02:11:52,919
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think so.

1829
02:11:52,979 --> 02:11:54,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Get him better seats at the VGAs next year.

1830
02:11:55,406 --> 02:12:23,449
[SPEAKER_06]: but that was just like a fantastic performance and I really liked their Harley too especially you find the little Easter egg and oops spoilers oops you find a positive pregnancy test in their little love nest and then in one of the endings she's singing to her baby so it's just lots of neat little things thrown about in there and the whole business with Hush that was pretty cool because that was actually the last Batman thing I ever read was Heart of Hush

1831
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:28,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not a big DC person but that was a really good storyline.

1832
02:12:28,472 --> 02:12:29,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it was really cool.

1833
02:12:29,913 --> 02:12:34,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It had lots of nods to just all kinds of different characters and it was really neat.

1834
02:12:36,357 --> 02:12:40,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, as a designer, love the design in the game.

1835
02:12:41,041 --> 02:12:41,501
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.

1836
02:12:43,414 --> 02:13:00,790
[SPEAKER_09]: for me I just have to start off by saying this has been extraordinarily hard this year there have been so many not just good but fucking phenomenal games this year that I have like I told Alan like three days ago what my list was going to be and I've changed it since then I've changed it several times since then and even now in my head I'm like

1837
02:13:01,511 --> 02:13:03,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I really want to say this as number three?

1838
02:13:03,774 --> 02:13:06,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do I want to put this game in there because this game was so fucking good?

1839
02:13:07,398 --> 02:13:10,482
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to just commit to what I'm going to say here.

1840
02:13:10,602 --> 02:13:16,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really think, you know, I kind of look back at fun and what game did I really enjoy.

1841
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:19,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I think my number three game of the year is...

1842
02:13:20,633 --> 02:13:45,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario 3D Land on the 3DS because you know and I said this on the show when I first reviewed it I really think it is the greatest Mario game they have done since the Super Nintendo one I think it's just the 3D works it makes you understand why a 3DS you know can can work it's one of those games where you keep peeling back the layers and even though it seems like god this game is easy as cake it's

1843
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:45,901
[SPEAKER_09]: in the beginning.

1844
02:13:46,241 --> 02:13:49,105
[SPEAKER_09]: It just gets crazier and crazier as you move on.

1845
02:13:49,665 --> 02:13:53,810
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a lot of the retro stuff that, you know, we love retro games here at OLR that we love.

1846
02:13:54,290 --> 02:14:00,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a worthy reason to own a 3DS, and I think that Mario 3D Land is my number three pick for Game of the Year.

1847
02:14:01,278 --> 02:14:09,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might very well be the only 3DS game right now where the 3D is more than just, oh, that looks neat.

1848
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:10,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1849
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:12,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in 3D.

1850
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:19,882
[SPEAKER_02]: When you play Super Mario 3D Land, the 3D is an integral part of the gameplay and the experience.

1851
02:14:20,222 --> 02:14:23,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And turning that little notch down on the side...

1852
02:14:24,503 --> 02:14:26,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it damages the game.

1853
02:14:26,684 --> 02:14:30,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love that you can invert the 3D, too.

1854
02:14:30,946 --> 02:14:33,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's hard to explain unless you do it, but it's very easy.

1855
02:14:33,427 --> 02:14:36,328
[SPEAKER_02]: You have it pop out or be recessed inwards, but it's still 3D.

1856
02:14:36,528 --> 02:14:37,028
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

1857
02:14:37,628 --> 02:14:45,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And I gotta remind you guys, I think, still to this day, that Mario 64 was quite a bit overrated because of a lot of its move to 3D.

1858
02:14:46,232 --> 02:14:48,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet, I love what 3D has done to Mario here.

1859
02:14:50,514 --> 02:14:52,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at myself and I can't justify it.

1860
02:14:52,414 --> 02:14:53,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it just works.

1861
02:14:55,737 --> 02:15:04,373
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's why I think it's one of the greatest games to come out this year absolutely Salacious Pop or Alan your number two pick

1862
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:15,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably going to say Dragon Age Origins since you said this could be games that we played in this year rather than came out.

1863
02:15:16,931 --> 02:15:27,001
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why I'm going back to a game from 2009 is that a lot of the big A-list games that came out like Deus Ex, I haven't played them so I don't want to talk out of my ass and hype up a game I've never played.

1864
02:15:29,303 --> 02:15:50,564
[SPEAKER_02]: um Bioware ever since you know the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG has shown that they are one of the best narrative and character writers in the industry um I would say even better than Blizzard and Valve and the twists and the care like Alistair and Morrigan who's he's the um

1865
02:15:51,124 --> 02:15:55,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Other Grey Warden and Morrigan is the Witch of the Wild are the first two NPCs you pick up.

1866
02:15:55,825 --> 02:16:10,467
[SPEAKER_02]: They are so engaging and I was fascinated with each of them for completely different reasons and they were acted and written so well and I was very invested in how I manipulated the game to make sure that I got endings that were right for them.

1867
02:16:11,968 --> 02:16:19,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Origins is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and a lot of the D&D engine based games that Bioware wrote in the 90s.

1868
02:16:20,349 --> 02:16:35,966
[SPEAKER_02]: and Dragon Age 2 if you play it which I believe that came out earlier this year the menu and the UI it's all very new school I'm not saying Dragon Age 2 is a bad game but you can tell right away even just by the menus that it's a different origins really harkens back to

1869
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:41,262
[SPEAKER_02]: The 90s experience for me, but with a present day game or story.

1870
02:16:41,602 --> 02:16:48,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so even though you went with a game that's a couple years old, you can do that because this is your picks for best game of 2011 and sometimes you don't discover the games until later.

1871
02:16:48,623 --> 02:16:53,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So for anyone who overlooked Origins, yeah, it's still relevant.

1872
02:16:53,805 --> 02:16:54,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Play it.

1873
02:16:54,445 --> 02:16:55,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fair enough.

1874
02:16:55,585 --> 02:16:58,045
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your number two pick.

1875
02:16:58,426 --> 02:17:02,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultimate Marvel vs. Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1876
02:17:03,487 --> 02:17:04,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Galactus Flick.

1877
02:17:04,547 --> 02:17:04,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Fling!

1878
02:17:06,024 --> 02:17:14,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Making My Hand Hurt, Awesome Cast, Firebrand, but I still go back and play Phoenix more than anything.

1879
02:17:15,129 --> 02:17:16,649
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just fun.

1880
02:17:17,350 --> 02:17:20,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And She-Hulk, of course, because She-Hulk is hardcore.

1881
02:17:21,672 --> 02:17:23,493
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's just a fun fighting game.

1882
02:17:23,973 --> 02:17:31,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It brought out all the DLC characters, plus more characters that people wanted to see, except for no freaking Mega Man.

1883
02:17:32,537 --> 02:17:34,138
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, perfect.

1884
02:17:35,578 --> 02:17:36,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Fighting Game Perfection.

1885
02:17:37,219 --> 02:17:42,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't bother you that it was only six months after the other Marvel vs. Capcom that also came out this year?

1886
02:17:42,861 --> 02:17:43,081
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1887
02:17:46,023 --> 02:17:46,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

1888
02:17:46,903 --> 02:17:48,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't buy any of the DLC.

1889
02:17:49,304 --> 02:17:49,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

1890
02:17:50,285 --> 02:17:53,366
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the tweaks in the gameplay actually made it worth it.

1891
02:17:53,746 --> 02:17:54,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt different enough.

1892
02:17:55,567 --> 02:17:55,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1893
02:17:57,124 --> 02:17:58,365
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two game of the year.

1894
02:17:58,965 --> 02:18:03,968
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one that's already been named, but I think it's a game absolutely worthy of the list.

1895
02:18:04,168 --> 02:18:08,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I never expected to enjoy Batman Arkham City as much as I did.

1896
02:18:09,170 --> 02:18:13,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Batman all the way back to the Adam West Batman.

1897
02:18:14,193 --> 02:18:16,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I admit I'm not as into reading the comics.

1898
02:18:16,954 --> 02:18:19,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not as into the animated series.

1899
02:18:19,275 --> 02:18:20,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched it a little bit when I was a kid.

1900
02:18:21,036 --> 02:18:24,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know the Mark Hamill Joker.

1901
02:18:24,198 --> 02:18:27,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the characterizations of these characters as much as some of y'all do.

1902
02:18:27,699 --> 02:18:30,901
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll be damned if I didn't just love this game.

1903
02:18:31,121 --> 02:18:33,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just the story in it is outstanding.

1904
02:18:33,622 --> 02:18:38,345
[SPEAKER_09]: The way they juggle all of the villains without making it seem like cheesy or over the top is great.

1905
02:18:38,765 --> 02:18:40,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the exploration.

1906
02:18:40,406 --> 02:18:42,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Love, love, love the Grand Theft...

1907
02:18:43,027 --> 02:19:12,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Batman style thing that they have going on I think the DLC is done rather tastefully the way you can have I mean the whole Catwoman debacle outside where some people didn't have their codes the stuff they kind of been doing beyond that like the Nightwing and everything I think is neat expansions to the game I love the side missions it's a rewarding experience and it's the total package when it comes to a video game absolutely is I have to ask you did you do the bit where Catwoman abandons Batman

1908
02:19:14,218 --> 02:19:14,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1909
02:19:15,058 --> 02:19:15,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it great?

1910
02:19:15,658 --> 02:19:15,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1911
02:19:17,059 --> 02:19:17,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw him.

1912
02:19:19,459 --> 02:19:20,400
[SPEAKER_06]: She's such a bitch.

1913
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:25,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, the way that I mean, just the way the characters are done alone, it makes the game outstanding.

1914
02:19:25,621 --> 02:19:31,163
[SPEAKER_09]: But just it's just I think you said it well when you said you didn't even play it.

1915
02:19:31,543 --> 02:19:32,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was like watching a movie.

1916
02:19:32,883 --> 02:19:33,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how good it is.

1917
02:19:34,463 --> 02:19:39,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and then to even take it a step further and actually kind of like get your hands on it and be in control is just outstanding.

1918
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:42,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I did actually play a little bit of it.

1919
02:19:42,481 --> 02:19:46,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not going to say I didn't play any of it, but it was Dan's save.

1920
02:19:47,023 --> 02:19:49,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And since I'd seen so much of it, I was like, there's no point.

1921
02:19:50,224 --> 02:19:51,665
[SPEAKER_06]: But I might go back and do it myself now.

1922
02:19:51,985 --> 02:19:54,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So much to go back for with the Riddler trophies and the little side.

1923
02:19:54,806 --> 02:19:55,867
[SPEAKER_06]: He's beaten the Riddler mission.

1924
02:19:55,887 --> 02:19:56,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

1925
02:19:57,207 --> 02:19:58,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I barely dented that.

1926
02:19:59,153 --> 02:20:01,294
[SPEAKER_06]: which is actually pretty messed up.

1927
02:20:02,455 --> 02:20:03,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and not that hard.

1928
02:20:04,796 --> 02:20:10,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so now we're going to go around and get the number one picks.

1929
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:12,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, here it is.

1930
02:20:12,241 --> 02:20:14,022
[SPEAKER_09]: The game of the year according to us.

1931
02:20:14,702 --> 02:20:14,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan.

1932
02:20:15,483 --> 02:20:15,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Portal 2.

1933
02:20:17,629 --> 02:20:18,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1934
02:20:33,575 --> 02:21:01,767
[SPEAKER_02]: narrative writing and it's a hilarious game it's an emotional game you feel sympathetic for both Wheatley and GLaDOS you learn so much backstory for pretty much everyone including even Shell if you know how to look for it and it's a very it really just holds on to you and it never lets go it's quick once you beat it once if you love the story so much you can run through it again in a couple hours and it never feels stale

1935
02:21:03,067 --> 02:21:26,666
[SPEAKER_02]: and it really um Valve especially with Half-Life 2 episodes 1 and 2 really have tried to increase their game as far as script writing and story being told through dialogue but Portal 2 is where they're really like you're gonna listen to this and you're gonna be invested in these characters and also here's awesome puzzle you know puzzle cracking too where you have to need to figure out what to do so

1936
02:21:30,748 --> 02:21:33,229
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your number one game of the year.

1937
02:21:33,449 --> 02:21:37,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I will answer it with a sound from my phone if it will play.

1938
02:21:45,872 --> 02:21:46,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that made it through.

1939
02:21:47,116 --> 02:21:47,536
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have.

1940
02:21:47,556 --> 02:21:47,896
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

1941
02:21:47,936 --> 02:21:49,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little quiet, but it made through.

1942
02:21:49,237 --> 02:21:51,538
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Portal 2, definitely.

1943
02:21:51,898 --> 02:21:57,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Because for all the same reasons that Alan said, and I've beaten it ten times in single player mode.

1944
02:21:57,660 --> 02:21:59,281
[SPEAKER_06]: More than ten times now in single player mode.

1945
02:22:00,221 --> 02:22:01,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep playing through that game.

1946
02:22:01,802 --> 02:22:03,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I've probably played through that game once a month.

1947
02:22:04,903 --> 02:22:05,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And poor Wheatley.

1948
02:22:33,052 --> 02:22:49,044
[SPEAKER_06]: and I love that actor so much I was watching him on Graham Norton one time where he was paid a thousand pounds to be donated to charity to do a somersault on stage and he had never done one before and this man is tall this man is like a moose

1949
02:22:50,878 --> 02:22:53,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, people would get my reference from Supernatural, but anyway.

1950
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:54,440
[SPEAKER_06]: He's tall.

1951
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:55,941
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very tall, very lanky.

1952
02:22:56,461 --> 02:22:57,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's taller than you, Alan.

1953
02:22:59,142 --> 02:23:06,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And just watching how good-natured he is, and the fact that he brings so much of himself into the character, I thought it was perfect.

1954
02:23:07,147 --> 02:23:13,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can really hear that fun part, even when Wheatley's being an evil bastard.

1955
02:23:14,210 --> 02:23:15,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just awesome, so...

1956
02:23:16,051 --> 02:23:20,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That and, you know, the giant mutant potato and all of the reoccurring jokes.

1957
02:23:21,695 --> 02:23:26,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And I even went in and tried to find all the stuff that did make it into the final game.

1958
02:23:26,858 --> 02:23:29,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Garfield conversation in co-op mode.

1959
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:36,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Where apparently the two little robots, Atlas and Peabody, were supposed to go and find a Garfield comic.

1960
02:23:37,064 --> 02:23:43,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And GLaDOS rewrites it to say that John Arbuckle filled the house with neurotoxin.

1961
02:23:43,548 --> 02:23:45,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad it's not Garfield without Garfield.

1962
02:23:46,608 --> 02:23:50,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to find you the little file to play.

1963
02:23:51,601 --> 02:23:51,901
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1964
02:23:53,102 --> 02:23:56,244
[SPEAKER_09]: My number one game of the year might surprise some people.

1965
02:23:58,146 --> 02:24:04,671
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really had to sit back and go, I don't ever beat video games anymore.

1966
02:24:05,191 --> 02:24:09,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that maybe I play these MMOs, games you can't beat.

1967
02:24:10,235 --> 02:24:20,062
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that I do this show or I just love video games so much that I try to play as many games as possible so I never have that attention span to finish a game.

1968
02:24:20,542 --> 02:24:26,950
[SPEAKER_09]: and I know it's a notorious joke on this show what bad gamer ADD I have that I never finish games.

1969
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:29,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, ooh, Sparkly, go here.

1970
02:24:29,573 --> 02:24:35,721
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was one game that came out this year that said, sit down and fucking play me till I'm finished.

1971
02:24:35,821 --> 02:24:36,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Just Dance ABBA.

1972
02:24:38,499 --> 02:24:41,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the best 30 minutes of my life.

1973
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:42,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Contemplated it.

1974
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:42,840
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

1975
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:44,161
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Just Dance ABBA.

1976
02:24:44,221 --> 02:24:44,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1977
02:24:46,661 --> 02:24:48,062
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't beat Just Dance ABBA.

1978
02:24:49,022 --> 02:24:58,885
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was absolutely sucked into this game start to finish, and it's an amazing fucking video game, and it's the best video game of the year.

1979
02:24:58,925 --> 02:25:02,166
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Portal 2, absolutely without question, is the best video game of the year.

1980
02:25:02,666 --> 02:25:26,637
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's everything these two said and I will emphasize the fact that this game probably still would have been the game of the year without the co-op or the shit that they've been adding to it since then I haven't even touched co-op I did play a little bit of the co-op I didn't beat co-op, I played a little bit of it and it's like, you know, that just further enhanced the experience of what was already an amazing game and, you know, the story was great

1981
02:25:27,177 --> 02:25:32,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to admit, the first game I liked, but I didn't love like DarkSakura did.

1982
02:25:33,361 --> 02:25:37,824
[SPEAKER_09]: But this game, I think as Alan said a minute ago, made the first game that much better.

1983
02:25:38,224 --> 02:25:38,825
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so good.

1984
02:25:41,627 --> 02:25:43,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, Portal 2 is my game of the year.

1985
02:25:44,548 --> 02:25:46,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting that all three of us have picked the same game.

1986
02:25:46,890 --> 02:25:51,513
[SPEAKER_02]: In Portal 1, 90% of the story happened in the last two levels of it.

1987
02:25:52,053 --> 02:26:05,588
[SPEAKER_02]: and the story up until then you could read the signs and a lot of it was really implied and then at the end the finale when you're doing the big escape that's where you figure out oh okay Portal 2 just hits the ground running you already know what the story is and it just keeps getting better and better and better and better

1988
02:26:10,377 --> 02:26:12,498
[SPEAKER_01]: You made it to one of the human habitats.

1989
02:26:13,139 --> 02:26:14,820
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for an artifact.

1990
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:17,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it as an archaeological dig.

1991
02:26:18,162 --> 02:26:21,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Their laughter centered around one of the objects in this room.

1992
02:26:22,624 --> 02:26:23,124
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1993
02:26:23,665 --> 02:26:24,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Scan it for me.

1994
02:26:25,946 --> 02:26:31,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house.

1995
02:26:31,849 --> 02:26:35,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, apparently it's not the cat's house or his

1996
02:26:38,702 --> 02:26:41,383
[SPEAKER_01]: The man who owns the lasagna is furious.

1997
02:26:42,823 --> 02:26:43,303
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

1998
02:26:44,804 --> 02:26:45,284
[SPEAKER_01]: The end?

1999
02:26:46,164 --> 02:26:46,864
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not funny.

2000
02:26:47,744 --> 02:26:49,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Do either of you feel like laughing?

2001
02:26:50,305 --> 02:26:51,745
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm pulling you out.

2002
02:26:54,106 --> 02:26:54,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.

2003
02:26:55,246 --> 02:26:57,167
[SPEAKER_01]: While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon.

2004
02:26:57,627 --> 02:26:58,547
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up on the screen.

2005
02:26:59,447 --> 02:27:06,329
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, in my version, the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped with deadly neurotoxin dispensers.

2006
02:27:07,239 --> 02:27:07,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Briefly.

2007
02:27:07,419 --> 02:27:07,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

2008
02:27:28,191 --> 02:27:35,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and by the way, I was telling the chat room earlier, but Dan and I were at Disneyland in line for Space Mountain going in the best of space.

2009
02:27:36,188 --> 02:27:37,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Space!

2010
02:27:40,657 --> 02:27:42,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I stand by what we said earlier.

2011
02:27:42,097 --> 02:27:43,878
[SPEAKER_09]: We did not compare lists, so I had no idea.

2012
02:27:43,898 --> 02:27:47,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of knew DarkSakura would go for Portal 2 as number one.

2013
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:48,620
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no question.

2014
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know Alan was going to go there, too.

2015
02:27:51,802 --> 02:27:53,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very interesting that we all picked the same game.

2016
02:27:53,943 --> 02:27:57,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say, for the first time in 10 years, I think we've all picked the same game.

2017
02:27:58,305 --> 02:27:59,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Consensus!

2018
02:27:59,365 --> 02:28:02,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, Loki's not here, and I kind of don't think Loki's going to go that way.

2019
02:28:02,647 --> 02:28:04,768
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll go Grand Theft Auto 4.

2020
02:28:05,428 --> 02:28:06,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that didn't come out this year.

2021
02:28:07,169 --> 02:28:08,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was his game last year.

2022
02:28:09,232 --> 02:28:13,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's going to go Saints Row the third, which admittedly... I thought it was going to be on your list.

2023
02:28:14,598 --> 02:28:17,021
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so fucking... How is Skyrim not on my list?

2024
02:28:18,122 --> 02:28:19,404
[SPEAKER_09]: How is Skyrim not on my list?

2025
02:28:20,104 --> 02:28:20,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't on mine.

2026
02:28:20,605 --> 02:28:22,687
[SPEAKER_09]: It was that good of a year for games.

2027
02:28:23,607 --> 02:28:25,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Skyrim absolutely should be in my top three.

2028
02:28:25,868 --> 02:28:27,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of don't care about Skyrim.

2029
02:28:28,990 --> 02:28:32,912
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're not really into those types of games, though.

2030
02:28:32,952 --> 02:28:35,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't expect you to like Skyrim.

2031
02:28:35,374 --> 02:28:39,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all the crap that people do in Skyrim, I try to do in WoW.

2032
02:28:41,677 --> 02:28:42,997
[SPEAKER_09]: 50,000 cheese wheels off the side of the mountain.

2033
02:28:43,017 --> 02:28:46,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can't do that, but I try to climb every mountain and try to get to places that no one can get to.

2034
02:28:47,479 --> 02:28:58,101
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I will admit, for quite some time, Saints Row the Third, just because of the fun factor part of it, that I have not laughed that fucking hard at a video game.

2035
02:28:58,842 --> 02:28:59,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, except maybe Portal 2.

2036
02:29:00,002 --> 02:29:03,243
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't even think Portal 2 I laughed as hard as I did at Saints Row the Third.

2037
02:29:03,543 --> 02:29:05,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just that fucking good.

2038
02:29:05,303 --> 02:29:07,304
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just, I look back and I go...

2039
02:29:08,785 --> 02:29:09,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Your three favorites.

2040
02:29:09,869 --> 02:29:10,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta make a commitment.

2041
02:29:11,014 --> 02:29:12,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mario edges it out slightly.

2042
02:29:13,182 --> 02:29:14,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Combustible lemons.

2043
02:29:17,305 --> 02:29:20,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the part that cracked me up to no end.

2044
02:29:20,807 --> 02:29:28,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we'll be able to say Portal 2 is going to end up the official OLR game of the year, just looking at the feedback and so forth.

2045
02:29:28,291 --> 02:29:33,515
[SPEAKER_09]: But Loki needs to have his say, so we'll get his input next week on what he thinks the top three games of the year are.

2046
02:29:34,335 --> 02:29:35,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Any guesses for Loki games?

2047
02:29:35,976 --> 02:29:39,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think we have all said Saints Row the Third will probably be his number one, but what else for Loki games?

2048
02:29:40,919 --> 02:29:41,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Skylanders.

2049
02:29:42,119 --> 02:29:43,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he'll put Skyrim on there too.

2050
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:46,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he'll put Skyrim in his top three.

2051
02:29:46,801 --> 02:29:48,802
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that Battlefield game?

2052
02:29:49,182 --> 02:29:50,843
[SPEAKER_09]: He loves Battlefield 3?

2053
02:29:51,523 --> 02:29:52,263
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not Battlefield.

2054
02:29:52,283 --> 02:29:52,843
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I saying?

2055
02:29:52,863 --> 02:29:53,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Like actual Battlefield?

2056
02:29:54,064 --> 02:30:01,406
[SPEAKER_06]: No, um... The 1840 or 1940 whatever that he plays with the ants.

2057
02:30:02,167 --> 02:30:04,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Modern War... But they play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

2058
02:30:04,907 --> 02:30:05,828
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not that.

2059
02:30:05,988 --> 02:30:06,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

2060
02:30:06,128 --> 02:30:08,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2061
02:30:08,709 --> 02:30:08,869
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

2062
02:30:09,488 --> 02:30:10,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking more of Dan.

2063
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:42,063
[SPEAKER_09]: If he could fuck around with it and hack it and stuff, that's the type of stuff he likes.

2064
02:30:42,164 --> 02:30:46,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I think his list will be Portal 2, Skyrim, and Saints Row the Third.

2065
02:30:47,407 --> 02:30:47,827
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

2066
02:30:48,848 --> 02:30:49,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I found you something else to play.

2067
02:30:50,669 --> 02:30:51,689
[SPEAKER_06]: You must play it.

2068
02:30:52,130 --> 02:30:52,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

2069
02:30:52,890 --> 02:30:53,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft.

2070
02:30:54,431 --> 02:30:55,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is what you were thinking of.

2071
02:30:55,632 --> 02:30:56,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Earth Defense Force.

2072
02:30:56,772 --> 02:30:58,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2073
02:30:58,373 --> 02:30:59,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Good call, Actdeft.

2074
02:30:59,854 --> 02:31:00,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

2075
02:31:00,315 --> 02:31:01,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Earth Defense Force will probably be in there.

2076
02:31:02,256 --> 02:31:03,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there's the last thing.

2077
02:31:04,037 --> 02:31:04,317
[SPEAKER_06]: It's short.

2078
02:31:04,753 --> 02:31:05,394
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

2079
02:31:21,460 --> 02:31:22,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.

2080
02:31:22,421 --> 02:31:23,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I've been thinking.

2081
02:31:23,922 --> 02:31:26,664
[SPEAKER_00]: When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade.

2082
02:31:27,125 --> 02:31:29,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Make life take the lemons back.

2083
02:31:29,507 --> 02:31:30,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Get mad!

2084
02:31:30,167 --> 02:31:31,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want your damn lemons!

2085
02:31:31,989 --> 02:31:33,570
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I supposed to do with these?

2086
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:35,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Demand to see life's manager.

2087
02:31:36,232 --> 02:31:40,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons.

2088
02:31:40,516 --> 02:31:42,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who I am?

2089
02:31:42,678 --> 02:31:46,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down with the lemons.

2090
02:31:46,801 --> 02:31:52,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!

2091
02:31:55,428 --> 02:31:56,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Burning people!

2092
02:31:56,168 --> 02:31:57,289
[SPEAKER_06]: He says what we're all thinking!

2093
02:31:58,770 --> 02:31:59,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2094
02:32:00,091 --> 02:32:03,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry I don't have the one that had GLaDOS on there because her comments make it extra funny.

2095
02:32:04,668 --> 02:32:06,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so there it is, our Game of the Year discussion.

2096
02:32:06,529 --> 02:32:11,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you guys enjoyed, or if you didn't, well, you're welcome to your own opinion.

2097
02:32:11,231 --> 02:32:17,013
[SPEAKER_09]: No, well, we got plenty of your opinions on the... I was surprised that only one person said Skyrim.

2098
02:32:18,143 --> 02:32:26,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I was limited by the fact that I play games 2-3 years late and the fact that I'm playing Skyrim when it's only 3 years old is actually kind of amazing and it's thanks to you getting it for me when it was cheap

2099
02:32:42,608 --> 02:32:43,549
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on.

2100
02:32:44,009 --> 02:32:45,410
[SPEAKER_09]: More gaming news for you guys.

2101
02:32:45,430 --> 02:32:46,671
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got the Mailbag FUs of the Week.

2102
02:32:46,691 --> 02:32:48,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, your phone call is coming up in just a little bit.

2103
02:32:49,634 --> 02:32:51,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go to Alan with some more news.

2104
02:32:53,457 --> 02:33:07,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of wank going on lately due to a feisty Valve employee who was seen at an event wearing a Half-Life Lambda circle logo with a 3 on it.

2105
02:33:07,708 --> 02:33:11,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And people saw that and were like, ooh, Half-Life 3 is coming.

2106
02:33:11,871 --> 02:33:28,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge Half-Life fan, and for those listening who don't remember, Half-Life 2 proper came out in 2004, nearly 10 years ago, and Half-Life 2 Episode 2 came out in the orange box, which I believe, when did, that was what, September of 07, when Portal 1 came out?

2107
02:33:28,966 --> 02:33:29,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

2108
02:33:36,312 --> 02:33:37,433
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2109
02:33:50,973 --> 02:34:17,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Chet Falasek who is a writer for Half-Life and Left 4 Dead and he also occasionally hits up the official forums has said that all of the rumors that the Half-Life community on the official forums has sort of dredged out and saying that Valve is working up to something there's an alternate reality game similar to what Portal 2 had when they updated the ending to Portal 1 where you call into like modems and you download all of these images all the Portal 2 stuff and

2110
02:34:18,895 --> 02:34:19,556
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all trolling.

2111
02:34:19,856 --> 02:34:23,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all trolling by Half-Life fans like myself, just trolling each other.

2112
02:34:24,921 --> 02:34:33,730
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no official ARG, or if there is, of course, it's one of those sort of, you can kind of see through the subtext of his response saying...

2113
02:34:36,457 --> 02:34:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: This is his official response.

2114
02:34:37,758 --> 02:34:38,718
[SPEAKER_02]: You are being trolled.

2115
02:34:38,818 --> 02:34:39,798
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no ARG.

2116
02:34:39,978 --> 02:34:41,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheatley's speech was set in Portal 2 fiction.

2117
02:34:41,979 --> 02:34:42,539
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all.

2118
02:34:43,059 --> 02:34:45,840
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been no directive from Gabe to leak anything.

2119
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:47,000
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all false.

2120
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:53,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would imagine there is something to leak, but it's all under lock and key by Valve.

2121
02:34:54,062 --> 02:34:56,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Finishing his quote, I just want to say...

2122
02:34:57,423 --> 02:34:57,943
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all just trolling.

2123
02:35:28,171 --> 02:35:28,692
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2124
02:35:44,253 --> 02:35:55,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if he did get disciplined for it, it's not a fireable offense for him to make a custom t-shirt that he knew was going to get the fandom to lose their minds.

2125
02:35:55,946 --> 02:35:59,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if he did get in trouble for it, we're not privy to that information.

2126
02:35:59,670 --> 02:36:00,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It's none of our business.

2127
02:36:01,707 --> 02:36:05,828
[SPEAKER_09]: How could Valve not be doing Half-Life 3 eventually?

2128
02:36:05,928 --> 02:36:07,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said, it's their bread and butter.

2129
02:36:09,449 --> 02:36:11,429
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably just keep going back and changing stuff.

2130
02:36:11,449 --> 02:36:11,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2131
02:36:12,169 --> 02:36:14,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think it's coming soon.

2132
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:16,890
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is left for Valve to do?

2133
02:36:17,110 --> 02:36:20,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're doing Defense of the Ancients.

2134
02:36:21,031 --> 02:36:22,031
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's in beta now.

2135
02:36:22,151 --> 02:36:23,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Defense of the Ancients is going to be out before E3.

2136
02:36:24,271 --> 02:36:26,092
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's Valve got to talk about at E3 this year?

2137
02:36:27,212 --> 02:36:27,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Left 4 Dead 3

2138
02:36:46,696 --> 02:36:49,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Give the Half-Life fans, throw them a fucking bone.

2139
02:36:49,197 --> 02:36:50,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Let this be their year.

2140
02:36:50,978 --> 02:36:52,639
[SPEAKER_09]: 2012 is the end of the world after all.

2141
02:36:53,419 --> 02:36:54,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Let them have their goddamn Half-Life 3.

2142
02:36:54,680 --> 02:37:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was six years between 1 and 2, and now it's 8 between 2 and conceivably 3 if they would say anything about it.

2143
02:37:01,783 --> 02:37:04,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like, we know that you're working on it.

2144
02:37:04,164 --> 02:37:06,605
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want, throw us a bone.

2145
02:37:06,665 --> 02:37:07,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, no, we're not ready.

2146
02:37:07,846 --> 02:37:08,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like Blizzard.

2147
02:37:08,566 --> 02:37:09,587
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to tell us shit.

2148
02:37:10,307 --> 02:37:11,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all just trolling that's going on right now.

2149
02:37:13,048 --> 02:37:13,329
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2150
02:37:13,949 --> 02:37:15,650
[SPEAKER_09]: At least you'll have Defense of the Ancients to hold you over.

2151
02:37:15,991 --> 02:37:17,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I no longer care.

2152
02:37:19,393 --> 02:37:19,674
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2153
02:37:20,474 --> 02:37:23,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to what I find to be kind of an interesting thing that happened.

2154
02:37:23,517 --> 02:37:25,739
[SPEAKER_09]: This has to do with the game Fallout New Vegas.

2155
02:37:26,539 --> 02:37:36,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess what happened is that the lead designer behind Fallout New Vegas actually released a mod to go with the game.

2156
02:37:37,268 --> 02:37:38,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an official patch.

2157
02:37:39,125 --> 02:37:42,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course now the source story isn't loading for me, but I read it earlier.

2158
02:37:42,488 --> 02:37:53,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And the official patch, or they didn't want to officially patch it because it was changing the games in ways that they may not want to subject everybody to in terms of balancing and so on.

2159
02:37:53,517 --> 02:37:53,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

2160
02:37:54,358 --> 02:37:56,080
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2161
02:38:12,057 --> 02:38:28,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Slash J. Sawyer underscore FNV underscore mod dot zip But yeah, it's for Fallout New Vegas It will turn up the difficulty Putting it up there to what he wanted in terms of difficulty Hence part of the reasons why they don't want to put it out there for everybody

2162
02:38:28,866 --> 02:38:30,767
[SPEAKER_09]: and he also just kind of said, you know what?

2163
02:38:30,787 --> 02:38:31,468
[SPEAKER_09]: The game's over.

2164
02:38:31,568 --> 02:38:32,148
[SPEAKER_09]: The ship's sailed.

2165
02:38:32,188 --> 02:38:33,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's working on it anymore.

2166
02:38:33,289 --> 02:38:33,989
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no testers.

2167
02:38:34,029 --> 02:38:34,530
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing.

2168
02:38:34,570 --> 02:38:36,831
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just me doing what I want to do in my free time.

2169
02:38:37,511 --> 02:38:39,292
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Fallout New Vegas is done.

2170
02:38:39,533 --> 02:38:45,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hold out hope for Fallout 4, I suppose, which would I would think going to be their next game now that Skyrim's out there.

2171
02:38:45,896 --> 02:38:48,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Fallout New Vegas is pretty good, I have to say.

2172
02:38:48,958 --> 02:38:49,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2173
02:38:50,419 --> 02:39:00,953
[SPEAKER_09]: so there you go there is by the way an ultimate edition of Fallout New Vegas coming out on February 7th but that's just all the DLC from Fallout New Vegas originally all put together in one little package there

2174
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:05,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty, let's go to the mailbag.

2175
02:39:05,553 --> 02:39:05,813
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2176
02:39:06,413 --> 02:39:06,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2177
02:39:07,234 --> 02:39:16,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaundradio.com and DarkSakura threatens to not read them, but then we beat her until she does.

2178
02:39:16,422 --> 02:39:17,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Beat, beat, beat.

2179
02:39:17,643 --> 02:39:17,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Beat.

2180
02:39:18,023 --> 02:39:19,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Bat, bat, bat, bat, bat.

2181
02:39:20,125 --> 02:39:20,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2182
02:39:20,505 --> 02:39:22,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna treat you like a Justin Bieber piñata.

2183
02:39:23,047 --> 02:39:23,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Bat, bat, bat, bat.

2184
02:39:25,089 --> 02:39:26,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things were hideous.

2185
02:39:27,551 --> 02:39:28,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Just some paper plates and party hats.

2186
02:39:28,852 --> 02:39:30,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper plates and party hats is what they are.

2187
02:39:30,233 --> 02:39:30,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Stapled together.

2188
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:38,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the first email comes from Robert M. Somehow I get the feeling that Jamie, if she's in studio tonight, has already seen this.

2189
02:39:38,317 --> 02:39:40,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But were you anticipating what I was about me not being here?

2190
02:39:41,181 --> 02:39:44,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I wasn't really seriously thinking of calling in.

2191
02:39:45,931 --> 02:39:49,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if so, please post this link to the chatroom and stop reading this now.

2192
02:39:49,834 --> 02:39:54,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, here's a pro-toy customizer's version of the Metal Slug Tank.

2193
02:39:54,318 --> 02:39:55,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Best of luck in the year ahead.

2194
02:39:55,699 --> 02:40:07,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I did see this, and I will post it in the chatroom, and if Ranma will be so kind as to put this picture and the link to the article on our Tumblr.

2195
02:40:07,429 --> 02:40:08,770
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little Lego.

2196
02:40:09,030 --> 02:40:09,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Lego.

2197
02:40:09,851 --> 02:40:10,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cute.

2198
02:40:11,992 --> 02:40:15,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Slug Cute So I will post this in the chat room now

2199
02:40:19,557 --> 02:40:22,658
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, also this music makes me kind of wish I was going on the Matterhorn.

2200
02:40:24,518 --> 02:40:25,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's kind of the same.

2201
02:40:25,819 --> 02:40:26,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

2202
02:40:28,740 --> 02:40:36,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So this comes from Holly D. Hey guys, I just wanted to share something that popped into my head when I heard about the poor guys on your show who have had their Xbox Live in-post screwed with.

2203
02:40:36,982 --> 02:40:43,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Particularly the guy who said he gave them information to investigate and then they said his credentials weren't right even though they hadn't changed since he opened the case.

2204
02:40:44,765 --> 02:40:45,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like WTF

2205
02:40:59,458 --> 02:41:01,639
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one pretty much hung up on me, so I called back again.

2206
02:41:01,679 --> 02:41:06,501
[SPEAKER_06]: This woman told me she could not access the account with me, even though I was calling about an appointment I obviously knew already.

2207
02:41:06,561 --> 02:41:14,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I argued with this woman for an hour, and she finally found that my account had been closed, and then the guy who set up the new service opened a new one and put in some BS number.

2208
02:41:15,004 --> 02:41:19,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had to reopen the old account, but she kept insisting that I had to go physically to one of their locations to fix it.

2209
02:41:20,189 --> 02:41:27,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, like hell I was, and I pointed out to her that if they weren't allowed to change the number, then who the hell gave him permission to change it in the first place?

2210
02:41:27,396 --> 02:41:29,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So she could clearly see it had changed.

2211
02:41:30,258 --> 02:41:53,400
[SPEAKER_06]: after that she put me on the phone with her supervisor who fixed it took about two hours total the basic point of this is to say try to point out the flaws in their logic and demand to know who authorized changing the information it gets results sometimes because you know if they're claiming they can't change it then they sure as hell know who authorized the first change I hope it helps and I hope they get their accounts back soon Holly D yeah

2212
02:41:55,142 --> 02:41:56,523
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what happened with Comcast with us?

2213
02:41:56,683 --> 02:41:56,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

2214
02:41:57,203 --> 02:42:07,006
[SPEAKER_06]: We were supposed to have everything fixed on Thursday, and the night before, Dan had a phone call, an automated phone call that said Thursday, and Dan had taken Thursday off work.

2215
02:42:07,426 --> 02:42:12,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then he goes to check it in the morning, and it said Friday, when Dan had to be at work.

2216
02:42:13,168 --> 02:42:20,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he called and he said, I told him to call his supervisor, but I was also, you know, seven in the morning and sleep.

2217
02:42:21,351 --> 02:42:21,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

2218
02:42:22,451 --> 02:42:28,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes these automations and computers and stuff just leads to trouble.

2219
02:42:28,496 --> 02:42:29,076
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a problem.

2220
02:42:29,116 --> 02:42:29,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Fail is what it is.

2221
02:42:30,217 --> 02:42:32,158
[SPEAKER_09]: She had to talk to a human being to get anything done.

2222
02:42:33,279 --> 02:42:33,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no.

2223
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:35,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan tried to talk to a human being and she wouldn't change it.

2224
02:42:37,258 --> 02:42:38,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, it's Blade 3 again.

2225
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:41,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say sorry about my grammar a couple weeks ago.

2226
02:42:42,102 --> 02:42:43,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I give everyone a hard time.

2227
02:42:43,643 --> 02:42:44,544
[SPEAKER_09]: She gives everyone shit.

2228
02:42:44,804 --> 02:42:46,405
[SPEAKER_06]: But use a period after a go, please.

2229
02:42:47,266 --> 02:42:50,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on a PSP 2000 semicolon and comma.

2230
02:42:51,109 --> 02:42:52,310
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.

2231
02:42:52,991 --> 02:42:55,533
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I was wondering what studio equipment you use.

2232
02:42:55,953 --> 02:43:00,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm setting up a recording studio and I was curious that should have a U in it about your mics and whatnot.

2233
02:43:01,557 --> 02:43:07,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Please keep it up, the awesome work.

2234
02:43:08,724 --> 02:43:11,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not as complicated as you'd think, the setup.

2235
02:43:11,186 --> 02:43:16,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I know for a show that's been around as long as we have, you'd think we'd have this fancy thing going on, but it's actually not that complicated.

2236
02:43:17,091 --> 02:43:18,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Our first board came off of eBay.

2237
02:43:19,073 --> 02:43:20,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the first board came off of eBay.

2238
02:43:20,474 --> 02:43:26,218
[SPEAKER_09]: The board we're using right now, we did upgrade to a newer board some time ago, and I'll tell you, it's what's called a Eurorack.

2239
02:43:27,279 --> 02:43:27,740
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by Behringer.

2240
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:29,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's by Behringer.

2241
02:43:29,541 --> 02:43:31,482
[SPEAKER_09]: UB1222FX Pro.

2242
02:43:31,883 --> 02:43:36,366
[SPEAKER_09]: There are pictures, if you look at the new studio pictures at orangeonestudio.com, you can see the mixing board sitting there in the background.

2243
02:43:36,746 --> 02:43:41,310
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really as simple as we have three microphones, and they're all hodgepodge microphones.

2244
02:43:42,130 --> 02:43:43,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a picture and put it up right now.

2245
02:43:43,311 --> 02:43:44,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a radio shack in my hand.

2246
02:43:44,592 --> 02:43:46,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Loki's is from Radio Shack.

2247
02:43:46,996 --> 02:43:50,420
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura's is a Behringer mic that I think she picked up when she picked up the board.

2248
02:43:50,861 --> 02:43:54,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine was donated by DDR Angel like eight years ago and it still works.

2249
02:43:55,247 --> 02:43:57,710
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like, this is an expensive mic and I want you guys to have it.

2250
02:43:57,790 --> 02:43:58,471
[SPEAKER_09]: And it still works.

2251
02:43:59,553 --> 02:44:00,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought this one because my old mic died.

2252
02:44:01,655 --> 02:44:05,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the DDR Angel mic is also a backup mic because it is sold.

2253
02:44:05,057 --> 02:44:06,658
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually had another mic that broke.

2254
02:44:06,818 --> 02:44:08,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you've got your Horde House one in the other room.

2255
02:44:08,660 --> 02:44:09,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know what that one's from.

2256
02:44:10,721 --> 02:44:13,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's another Radio Shack mic, but it's like a newer Radio Shack mic.

2257
02:44:14,003 --> 02:44:16,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So they all plug into the board.

2258
02:44:16,965 --> 02:44:19,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Every mic that I've bought, I've gotten at Guitar Center.

2259
02:44:20,126 --> 02:44:23,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And every mic I think I've got at Radio Shack, maybe one at Fry's.

2260
02:44:23,670 --> 02:44:25,672
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, they all plug into the board.

2261
02:44:25,732 --> 02:44:27,394
[SPEAKER_09]: We try to equalize things on the board.

2262
02:44:27,454 --> 02:44:30,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize our voices are not always equalized.

2263
02:44:30,557 --> 02:44:32,419
[SPEAKER_09]: We try best we can to adjust things on the fly.

2264
02:44:32,859 --> 02:44:41,468
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, sometimes some of my co-hosts, especially DarkSakura and Loki, tend to be very quiet if they're in a bad mood.

2265
02:44:41,828 --> 02:44:42,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2266
02:44:42,409 --> 02:44:43,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they get very excited!

2267
02:44:45,973 --> 02:44:46,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's worse, though.

2268
02:44:47,855 --> 02:44:49,697
[SPEAKER_09]: He is a lot worse.

2269
02:44:49,797 --> 02:44:54,102
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, look at our website and our little photos at the top.

2270
02:44:54,182 --> 02:44:58,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sent a picture of the computer and the soundboard.

2271
02:44:58,707 --> 02:44:59,467
[SPEAKER_09]: By themselves.

2272
02:45:01,309 --> 02:45:02,691
[SPEAKER_09]: The computer was donated by the listeners.

2273
02:45:02,731 --> 02:45:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: The monitor is from Dan's mom.

2274
02:45:05,073 --> 02:45:09,538
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... Okay, when Dan's grandmom got a new computer, we took the monitor.

2275
02:45:10,679 --> 02:45:12,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of our spare monitors.

2276
02:45:13,101 --> 02:45:14,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just a simple flat screen monitor.

2277
02:45:15,083 --> 02:45:18,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And the computer was donated by the listeners, which was an awesome gesture.

2278
02:45:18,506 --> 02:45:23,130
[SPEAKER_09]: That was when I had the Diva Fit one episode and I stormed off the set because... What had happened?

2279
02:45:23,591 --> 02:45:25,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the show just kind of died in the middle.

2280
02:45:25,673 --> 02:45:28,576
[SPEAKER_09]: The computer... Didn't the sound card...

2281
02:45:29,136 --> 02:45:31,758
[SPEAKER_09]: The sound card went out and- Just crapped in the middle of the show.

2282
02:45:31,818 --> 02:45:33,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the graphic card went out too.

2283
02:45:33,319 --> 02:45:46,389
[SPEAKER_09]: And then somebody in chat just, you know, sometimes, and they, you know, the person apologized to me afterwards, so I don't mean to like dig up this four-year-old drama, but it was, you know, just unfortunately say the wrong thing at the wrong moment, and I just fucking lost it.

2284
02:45:47,609 --> 02:45:55,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know it was a moment when Travis called me the next day to go, that was the best thing that has ever happened on OLR.

2285
02:45:55,735 --> 02:45:55,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2286
02:45:57,777 --> 02:46:13,409
[SPEAKER_09]: and Travis doesn't say nice things about OLR very often but he called me to say Rob that was the best thing you ever did on OLR but the listeners after hearing that actually pulled together and bought a new computer and we use it to this day

2287
02:46:14,350 --> 02:46:27,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in studio DarkSakura when the show computer before this one, it was going to be my second or third guest appearance on OLR, it was when we had just started dating, where the old show computer died.

2288
02:46:27,902 --> 02:46:28,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It went kaput.

2289
02:46:30,034 --> 02:46:30,594
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2290
02:46:53,121 --> 02:46:54,562
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, that was my donation.

2291
02:46:54,602 --> 02:46:55,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That was yours, that's right.

2292
02:46:56,283 --> 02:46:58,084
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the one that crapped out on that show.

2293
02:46:58,224 --> 02:46:58,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2294
02:46:58,604 --> 02:46:59,605
[SPEAKER_09]: That caused me to lose it.

2295
02:47:00,165 --> 02:47:03,888
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because it was 5.30 and you were firing up the computer and getting everything ready.

2296
02:47:04,488 --> 02:47:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just, it died, it stopped.

2297
02:47:07,810 --> 02:47:09,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, something happened.

2298
02:47:09,231 --> 02:47:11,192
[SPEAKER_06]: That was right before we got, no, that was it.

2299
02:47:11,212 --> 02:47:12,213
[SPEAKER_09]: But we were able to fix it.

2300
02:47:12,333 --> 02:47:13,193
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to fix it.

2301
02:47:13,334 --> 02:47:18,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Something, it was something we found out later on was like a setting or something was screwed up, but we were able to fix it.

2302
02:47:18,177 --> 02:47:20,378
[SPEAKER_09]: But it just screwed the show that night, so.

2303
02:47:20,398 --> 02:47:20,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2304
02:47:20,658 --> 02:47:38,912
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah and also the uh this soundboard that you guys have just goes into the line in on your sound card and then you guys use what audition for the yeah we use audition for the for the podcasting itself yeah the mixing board goes into the computer through the line in and then it's all recorded straight in adobe audition

2305
02:47:39,212 --> 02:47:40,192
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2306
02:47:55,578 --> 02:47:58,459
[SPEAKER_06]: My old laptop had the capability, except for that card, it was actually listed as speaker output.

2307
02:47:58,499 --> 02:47:58,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2308
02:48:19,793 --> 02:48:21,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, well different sound cards.

2309
02:48:21,755 --> 02:48:25,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that came, you want to have it set to anything that's going to come out of the speaker.

2310
02:48:26,121 --> 02:48:30,866
[SPEAKER_09]: I think somebody explained it to me as you want a full duplex card and not a half duplex card.

2311
02:48:31,227 --> 02:48:33,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Because full duplex is what's capable in and out at the same time.

2312
02:48:34,150 --> 02:48:35,632
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's very important.

2313
02:48:36,032 --> 02:48:40,017
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to do podcasts from your computer, spend the extra money to get a nicer sound card and you'll be set.

2314
02:48:40,177 --> 02:48:45,202
[SPEAKER_06]: My nice awesome quad core computer doesn't have a sound card that does that, but my old crappy laptop does.

2315
02:48:49,066 --> 02:48:54,130
[SPEAKER_09]: In the chat, DarkTetsuya says, oh, I think he had that clip on Understation Live not too long after.

2316
02:48:54,150 --> 02:48:54,811
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a clip?

2317
02:48:55,392 --> 02:48:55,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Lord.

2318
02:48:56,633 --> 02:49:02,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it probably was all recorded on Justin.TV, or did Justin.TV go out when the rest of it went out?

2319
02:49:03,079 --> 02:49:03,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

2320
02:49:03,499 --> 02:49:05,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we were using Justin.TV.

2321
02:49:06,115 --> 02:49:06,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

2322
02:49:06,915 --> 02:49:08,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because we were in the garage studio when that happened.

2323
02:49:09,237 --> 02:49:13,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think Justin TV was out, but... I don't remember.

2324
02:49:13,839 --> 02:49:14,959
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so long ago now.

2325
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that clip will show up soon enough, though.

2326
02:49:18,281 --> 02:49:21,363
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ranma says it's Sound Blaster, Odigy, or Better.

2327
02:49:21,923 --> 02:49:23,024
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you're going to want out of a card.

2328
02:49:23,664 --> 02:49:26,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that's my very long-winded memory lane answer to that short question.

2329
02:49:27,486 --> 02:49:28,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have one last email.

2330
02:49:28,906 --> 02:49:29,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2331
02:49:29,527 --> 02:49:35,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, it's from... Well, it didn't... I'm just going to say from Nigel.

2332
02:49:37,051 --> 02:49:39,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's an article from The Guardian, UK national newspaper.

2333
02:49:40,092 --> 02:49:41,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I read The Guardian all the time, so yeah.

2334
02:49:41,813 --> 02:49:43,453
[SPEAKER_06]: That might interest one DarkSakura.

2335
02:49:44,354 --> 02:49:46,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And here it is.

2336
02:49:46,334 --> 02:49:49,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing video games makes me sick, is what it's called.

2337
02:49:50,396 --> 02:49:53,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And I scammed it over, and...

2338
02:49:56,149 --> 02:49:57,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go ahead and read this bit of the paragraph.

2339
02:49:59,411 --> 02:50:00,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's talking about playing MW3.

2340
02:50:00,952 --> 02:50:01,212
[SPEAKER_06]: He says,

2341
02:50:26,205 --> 02:50:31,309
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it was triggered from the first time I played such a game, the PlayStation Classic Doom in 1995.

2342
02:50:33,070 --> 02:50:42,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, the pixel games don't do it to me that badly, like Doom, but the worst game that ever did it to me was...

2343
02:50:43,757 --> 02:50:44,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Crap, what was it?

2344
02:50:44,778 --> 02:50:46,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Goldeneye on Nintendo 64.

2345
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:50,483
[SPEAKER_06]: That game would make me so sick.

2346
02:50:50,683 --> 02:50:56,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't watch, because Dan was playing through it at the time, and he loves that game, and I wanted to love it.

2347
02:50:56,408 --> 02:50:57,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I really did.

2348
02:50:57,669 --> 02:50:58,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, sick.

2349
02:50:58,729 --> 02:50:59,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't play Unreal.

2350
02:51:00,271 --> 02:51:05,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't play the newer Quakes, because anything that was actually 3D would make me sick.

2351
02:51:06,036 --> 02:51:07,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Katamari made me super sick.

2352
02:51:07,717 --> 02:51:09,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal makes me way sick.

2353
02:51:10,339 --> 02:51:13,742
[SPEAKER_06]: because it doesn't have that fast reorientation the way that Portal 2 does.

2354
02:51:14,342 --> 02:51:17,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So Portal 2 made me sick at first, but I could get used to it.

2355
02:51:18,425 --> 02:51:19,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I can play it with no problem.

2356
02:51:20,326 --> 02:51:27,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I do have to stop every few levels and let my eyes readjust, but I can't play the first Portal for very long at all because it will make me very nauseous.

2357
02:51:28,132 --> 02:51:31,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Technically, you're supposed to do that with any game anyway, every 30 minutes or so.

2358
02:51:31,814 --> 02:51:32,954
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people do that, Rob?

2359
02:51:33,114 --> 02:51:35,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just saying, you're supposed to, and there's a reason.

2360
02:51:36,195 --> 02:51:37,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm usually also multitasking.

2361
02:51:37,976 --> 02:51:39,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking to people while I'm playing Portal.

2362
02:51:40,997 --> 02:51:46,479
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, basically, it's just... Here's another thing that he says.

2363
02:51:46,639 --> 02:51:47,000
[SPEAKER_06]: The U.S.

2364
02:51:47,100 --> 02:51:56,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Army Research Institute for Behavioral Social Science also studied flight simulators and found that slightly fewer than half of pilots using them reported symptoms similar to motion sickness.

2365
02:51:58,104 --> 02:52:06,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is actually super cool, and I would also, in fact, I'm gonna link this in the chat room as well, because I think that other people will benefit from this.

2366
02:52:07,309 --> 02:52:08,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Spazinator, you can shut the fuck up.

2367
02:52:11,592 --> 02:52:13,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator, by the way, said, wanna play some GoldenEye?

2368
02:52:14,634 --> 02:52:17,115
[SPEAKER_09]: But to be fair, he did put colon P, which means he isn't serious.

2369
02:52:17,275 --> 02:52:17,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2370
02:52:17,815 --> 02:52:19,797
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wasn't serious, although...

2371
02:52:21,075 --> 02:52:33,684
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah I just would get so sick and I get a little motion sick in a car if I'm not driving but yeah alright that it for emails?

2372
02:52:34,865 --> 02:52:46,973
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I do not complain every other second so AGN728 bite me bite me that's not a complaint that's a command you should complain about the fact that they can't be bothered to change your nickname

2373
02:52:48,524 --> 02:52:48,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2374
02:52:50,545 --> 02:52:50,825
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2375
02:52:51,206 --> 02:52:51,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

2376
02:52:52,306 --> 02:52:54,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if that's for Angry Gaming Nerd, maybe?

2377
02:52:56,189 --> 02:52:58,690
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's somebody that's coming from All Games Radio, All Games Network.

2378
02:52:58,750 --> 02:53:01,252
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in the All Games chat as opposed to chat.orange.radio.

2379
02:53:01,752 --> 02:53:03,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you didn't have to kick him.

2380
02:53:04,694 --> 02:53:05,735
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you kick him for?

2381
02:53:05,855 --> 02:53:06,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I can handle my own battles.

2382
02:53:07,136 --> 02:53:09,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a grown woman and I can fight my own battles.

2383
02:53:10,157 --> 02:53:10,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Now look at that.

2384
02:53:10,858 --> 02:53:12,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite all that, she's got your back.

2385
02:53:12,839 --> 02:53:14,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite all that, she has your back.

2386
02:53:14,139 --> 02:53:14,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite all that.

2387
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:16,740
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to slap Ranma with a trout right now.

2388
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:18,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I wanted to kick him myself.

2389
02:53:18,461 --> 02:53:19,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, no, I'm kidding.

2390
02:53:20,081 --> 02:53:21,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have done that because I'm a good girl.

2391
02:53:21,902 --> 02:53:23,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I will slap Ranma with a trout for you.

2392
02:53:23,783 --> 02:53:24,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2393
02:53:24,203 --> 02:53:24,483
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2394
02:53:24,523 --> 02:53:25,703
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2395
02:53:26,764 --> 02:53:30,325
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to, we actually, I wish we could change that to like with large boobs or something.

2396
02:53:31,865 --> 02:53:32,646
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on.

2397
02:53:32,766 --> 02:53:33,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2398
02:53:33,346 --> 02:53:34,066
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to move on.

2399
02:53:35,947 --> 02:53:36,527
[SPEAKER_09]: FUs of the Week.

2400
02:53:36,747 --> 02:53:41,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, speaking of complaints, what a perfect time for us to do our normal segment of the FUs of the Week.

2401
02:53:56,972 --> 02:54:03,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, really, my complaint is fuck you to moving.

2402
02:54:04,119 --> 02:54:06,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Because moving is awful.

2403
02:54:07,583 --> 02:54:11,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I like being in the new house that isn't falling apart like my old house was.

2404
02:54:12,928 --> 02:54:18,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate paying rent now, but I really like being in the new place.

2405
02:54:19,275 --> 02:54:23,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just the soreness and the pain that comes with all the moving.

2406
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:27,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And not really just the physical stuff, but the emotional side of it too.

2407
02:54:27,905 --> 02:54:30,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, Dan and I lived at that old house.

2408
02:54:31,368 --> 02:54:33,631
[SPEAKER_06]: We got married living in that old house.

2409
02:54:34,474 --> 02:54:36,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We had lots of wonderful fights in that old house.

2410
02:54:37,717 --> 02:54:40,060
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done lots of other things in that house.

2411
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:42,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Shermie's pooped on it.

2412
02:54:43,042 --> 02:54:45,285
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, how many... Shermie hasn't pooped on this house yet.

2413
02:54:45,305 --> 02:54:47,307
[SPEAKER_09]: You've prayed in that house, is what you meant to say.

2414
02:54:49,369 --> 02:54:50,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob, I've prayed.

2415
02:54:50,830 --> 02:54:52,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I've prayed a lot.

2416
02:54:52,932 --> 02:54:54,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh God, oh God, oh God.

2417
02:54:55,822 --> 02:54:56,623
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2418
02:54:57,964 --> 02:55:05,269
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, on top of that, that house before, you know, we rented from our friends and they got married in the backyard of that house.

2419
02:55:05,749 --> 02:55:06,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

2420
02:55:06,310 --> 02:55:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, we have lots of memories of going over there to visit our friends, too.

2421
02:55:09,933 --> 02:55:13,375
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a decade of memories of that house.

2422
02:55:14,176 --> 02:55:16,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we're going to miss our neighbors.

2423
02:55:16,978 --> 02:55:17,758
[SPEAKER_06]: We told them where we live.

2424
02:55:18,219 --> 02:55:19,540
[SPEAKER_06]: We literally moved three blocks away.

2425
02:55:20,420 --> 02:55:23,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to add a thank you to Dan for this morning.

2426
02:55:24,362 --> 02:55:29,565
[SPEAKER_06]: When he kind of woke me up when he was about to leave, he said, you don't have to do anything today.

2427
02:55:30,085 --> 02:55:36,788
[SPEAKER_06]: You have my full blessing to stay in bed all day or play WoW all day if you want to.

2428
02:55:37,629 --> 02:55:40,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not expect a single chore out of you.

2429
02:55:40,690 --> 02:55:41,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got up and did the dishes.

2430
02:55:43,078 --> 02:55:46,809
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I did the dishes when I got up because I just wanted my coffee cup.

2431
02:55:51,044 --> 02:55:54,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dan did all that, so... We have this kind of jack thing.

2432
02:55:55,587 --> 02:56:02,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a big metal platform on top, and you put it under the table, and you jack it up like a car jack.

2433
02:56:03,593 --> 02:56:04,594
[SPEAKER_09]: He had to jack it.

2434
02:56:06,015 --> 02:56:10,178
[SPEAKER_06]: But it lifts the whole table up so that you can move it on this wheeled object.

2435
02:56:10,598 --> 02:56:16,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So that in and of itself isn't very heavy, and you can raise it to the level of a truck and slide it in.

2436
02:56:16,903 --> 02:56:17,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2437
02:56:17,864 --> 02:56:19,066
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a science to that shit.

2438
02:56:19,086 --> 02:56:20,748
[SPEAKER_06]: The refrigerator was harder to move.

2439
02:56:21,570 --> 02:56:25,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we had to take the doors off the house and the doors off the refrigerator to get the damn thing in.

2440
02:56:25,775 --> 02:56:26,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we gotta move on with the FUs.

2441
02:56:26,777 --> 02:56:27,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2442
02:56:27,197 --> 02:56:27,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2443
02:56:28,018 --> 02:56:28,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan.

2444
02:56:31,192 --> 02:56:47,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy, um, it's a new year, it's when people set arbitrary expectations on life changes, you know, resolutions, and I'm like really fat right now, so I've ended up being really out of shape and weighing the most I've ever weighed in my life.

2445
02:56:47,398 --> 02:56:49,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame happiness.

2446
02:56:52,136 --> 02:56:53,277
[SPEAKER_09]: It's relationship weight.

2447
02:56:54,197 --> 02:56:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm so miserable.

2448
02:56:55,378 --> 02:57:03,943
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's being unemployed, and, you know, it's apparently done wonders for my appetite that I don't need, so... I just need to lose weight.

2449
02:57:05,684 --> 02:57:07,985
[SPEAKER_06]: That happened, though, when I first moved out here and moved in with Dan.

2450
02:57:08,805 --> 02:57:14,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I went from a size 12, which I don't care, I've always had some butt to me, to a 24 size.

2451
02:57:17,063 --> 02:57:19,707
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think Rob's accurate.

2452
02:57:19,747 --> 02:57:27,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it happens when you're not working, relationship weight, when you're... A lot of stuff involved, so... And you're certainly not a size 24 anymore.

2453
02:57:28,460 --> 02:57:30,984
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I lost 60 pounds.

2454
02:57:31,725 --> 02:57:31,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2455
02:57:31,985 --> 02:57:32,346
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not!

2456
02:57:34,588 --> 02:57:47,434
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was helping do volunteer crew for Umlaut, the rock band fundraiser, it's fine now, but for a day or two after, for a good two weeks, my right knee was hurting because I guess I picked something up wrong.

2457
02:57:47,514 --> 02:57:50,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Better than my back, which is injured, but it's okay now.

2458
02:57:51,275 --> 02:57:52,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that means you're getting old.

2459
02:57:52,736 --> 02:57:55,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Lift stuff up means you're out of shape and you're getting old.

2460
02:57:56,118 --> 02:57:58,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So just being out of shape and overweight.

2461
02:58:00,917 --> 02:58:17,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, my FU of the week, I don't know, I don't really have a lot, because, shit, I'm on vacation right now, and I, I have an extra week off, I don't have to go back tomorrow like most people do, so, and I'm going to Disneyland, shit, life's pretty fucking good right now, so, FU to the fact that it all has to end sometime.

2462
02:58:17,639 --> 02:58:18,640
[SPEAKER_06]: FU for not taking me.

2463
02:58:19,571 --> 02:58:22,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, F you to you for not being taken.

2464
02:58:23,055 --> 02:58:23,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2465
02:58:23,935 --> 02:58:24,216
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2466
02:58:26,538 --> 02:58:27,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart, heart, heart.

2467
02:58:27,539 --> 02:58:28,260
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2468
02:58:28,320 --> 02:58:29,341
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for the FUs of the week.

2469
02:58:29,421 --> 02:58:29,721
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2470
02:58:30,122 --> 02:58:34,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line and take your Twitter topics.

2471
02:58:34,226 --> 02:58:36,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have a lot of Twitter topics yet, but we'll see.

2472
02:58:36,808 --> 02:58:38,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2473
02:58:38,730 --> 02:58:41,013
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, just a couple quick stories for you guys.

2474
02:58:41,273 --> 02:58:41,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan.

2475
02:58:42,970 --> 02:58:47,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Meat, who made the amazing sort of... God.

2476
02:58:47,233 --> 02:58:47,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

2477
02:58:48,314 --> 02:58:49,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see Actdeft in chat?

2478
02:58:50,055 --> 02:58:50,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2479
02:58:50,875 --> 02:58:51,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That you took an arrow to the knee?

2480
02:58:51,996 --> 02:58:52,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2481
02:58:53,717 --> 02:58:54,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Die!

2482
02:58:54,918 --> 02:58:58,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a sneeze on deck, so I'm going to try and burn through this story.

2483
02:58:59,201 --> 02:59:10,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Meat released a game called The Binding of Isaac, and it's the same art as Super Meat Boy, which is a great retro-ish game that made a lot of top ten lists for this year.

2484
02:59:11,390 --> 02:59:14,212
[SPEAKER_02]: The Binding of Isaac, it's currently available on PC via Steam.

2485
02:59:14,733 --> 02:59:19,878
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in talks to bring it to the 3DS via their 3DS app store.

2486
02:59:20,458 --> 02:59:23,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are just playing VVVVV on the 3DS.

2487
02:59:23,141 --> 02:59:25,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Different developer, but it's still a Steam indie game.

2488
02:59:25,943 --> 02:59:27,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Now available on a handheld.

2489
02:59:27,925 --> 02:59:34,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Meat is trying to bring The Binding of Isaac, which I guess is a roguelike dungeon crawler game.

2490
02:59:34,912 --> 02:59:38,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It has some biblical story points to it.

2491
02:59:38,576 --> 02:59:40,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's really awesome.

2492
02:59:40,838 --> 02:59:43,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of gross, but Super Meat Boy was kind of gross too.

2493
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:44,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the same art style.

2494
02:59:44,581 --> 02:59:46,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for it on the 3DS.

2495
02:59:46,203 --> 02:59:47,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're in talks.

2496
02:59:48,245 --> 02:59:49,206
[SPEAKER_02]: That is interesting.

2497
02:59:49,406 --> 02:59:50,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

2498
02:59:50,087 --> 02:59:53,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like where that's going if a lot of those indie games are suddenly going to show up on 3DS.

2499
02:59:53,670 --> 03:00:03,518
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to bring Super Meat Boy to the Wii, but the limitations on the patching and how big I think the max file size could be, they couldn't do it.

2500
03:00:03,578 --> 03:00:11,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that they're still talking to Nintendo trying to get their next game after Super Meat Boy 2, the 3DS is a great sign.

2501
03:00:12,671 --> 03:00:12,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2502
03:00:14,255 --> 03:00:14,576
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2503
03:00:16,461 --> 03:00:18,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly tonight, a story that...

2504
03:00:20,428 --> 03:00:21,369
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2505
03:00:42,985 --> 03:01:06,619
[SPEAKER_09]: new copies have a code that comes with it but an online pass is purchased through the PlayStation Network if you have a used or a downloaded copy now this was amended later on because I guess at first they were like oh shit if you download it you have to get the online pass as well but it actually was updated to say that hold on the online pass is actually already included when you download it on PlayStation Network so you don't have to download it separately just to be fair

2506
03:01:07,319 --> 03:01:11,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So the online passes though, they are going over to the PS Vita.

2507
03:01:12,305 --> 03:01:16,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the online pass will cost 900 yen for Hot Shots Golf.

2508
03:01:16,489 --> 03:01:19,893
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about $11.50 US.

2509
03:01:19,933 --> 03:01:25,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can expect $10 probably to be about the same price here in the US.

2510
03:01:26,941 --> 03:01:27,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

2511
03:01:28,816 --> 03:01:31,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess it's probably not surprising to hear, right?

2512
03:01:32,497 --> 03:01:32,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2513
03:01:33,478 --> 03:01:33,778
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2514
03:01:34,978 --> 03:01:36,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones.

2515
03:01:36,279 --> 03:01:37,599
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to open up the phones right now.

2516
03:01:38,039 --> 03:01:38,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2517
03:01:38,399 --> 03:01:40,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I was doing my hair.

2518
03:01:40,920 --> 03:01:44,221
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2519
03:01:44,721 --> 03:01:49,603
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go to the Twitter topics real quick and read some of the stories and things you guys want to talk about.

2520
03:01:50,143 --> 03:01:52,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot of feedback this week.

2521
03:01:52,725 --> 03:01:56,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't get a lot through the week probably because of the holidays.

2522
03:01:57,049 --> 03:01:57,990
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's see.

2523
03:01:58,190 --> 03:02:03,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Redertainment tweeted us saying, voting is live for the fourth annual The Four Star Awards.

2524
03:02:04,115 --> 03:02:04,595
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?

2525
03:02:04,796 --> 03:02:08,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like your own personal... What is The Four Star Awards?

2526
03:02:08,699 --> 03:02:09,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2527
03:02:09,479 --> 03:02:10,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not nominated.

2528
03:02:11,141 --> 03:02:16,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, there's no podcast category, but we should be nominated for Movie of the Year.

2529
03:02:19,133 --> 03:02:19,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

2530
03:02:20,336 --> 03:02:20,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

2531
03:02:20,817 --> 03:02:21,599
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on Facebook.

2532
03:02:21,619 --> 03:02:22,721
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to check it out.

2533
03:02:22,962 --> 03:02:23,262
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2534
03:02:25,731 --> 03:02:27,132
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll pimp out any awards show.

2535
03:02:27,152 --> 03:02:28,052
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

2536
03:02:28,072 --> 03:02:31,114
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2537
03:02:31,874 --> 03:02:34,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Tigerclaw sent us a couple quick tweets here.

2538
03:02:34,596 --> 03:02:35,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I read about one of these earlier.

2539
03:02:35,756 --> 03:02:38,978
[SPEAKER_09]: He sent us a tweet about dude turned Swapnote into an RPG.

2540
03:02:39,358 --> 03:02:43,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to admit, I didn't pick this story for tonight because I wasn't sure how to explain it.

2541
03:02:44,141 --> 03:02:45,001
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a YouTube.

2542
03:02:45,041 --> 03:02:52,205
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nine minutes long, so I'm not going to play the entire YouTube for you guys, but some guy... If you don't know what Swapnote is, it came out on the 3DS this week.

2543
03:02:52,405 --> 03:02:52,866
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, um...

2544
03:02:53,826 --> 03:03:02,093
[SPEAKER_09]: A system that lets you basically exchange emails, except instead of written emails, they're little actual written handwritten notes that you can send to other people.

2545
03:03:02,133 --> 03:03:06,377
[SPEAKER_09]: But as you use Swapnote more, you can start to send five second messages or pictures.

2546
03:03:06,597 --> 03:03:12,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually sent to all the people on my friends list on 3DS, I sent a picture of Maruko, one of the cats here, and sent it out.

2547
03:03:13,203 --> 03:03:15,544
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's kind of like a fun way to share things.

2548
03:03:15,664 --> 03:03:18,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, oh, wow, Nintendo is actually embracing the Internet for something.

2549
03:03:18,426 --> 03:03:23,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, somebody actually turned it into a full-fledged RPG in the vein of Dungeons & Dragons.

2550
03:03:23,629 --> 03:03:26,070
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess there's even like a Dungeon Master template you can use.

2551
03:03:26,611 --> 03:03:29,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And he talks about all this in his YouTube on how he did it.

2552
03:03:29,192 --> 03:03:35,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it's a little long for me to play here, but it's mncdover is the username on YouTube if you want to look that up for yourself.

2553
03:03:37,297 --> 03:03:46,709
[SPEAKER_09]: and one other tweet here from Tigerclaw Epic Games scores a victory against Silicon Knights in a two-human suit

2554
03:03:48,658 --> 03:03:50,659
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't even remember what this suit was all about.

2555
03:03:50,699 --> 03:03:51,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm loading the story now.

2556
03:03:51,740 --> 03:03:54,602
[SPEAKER_09]: He's linked us to a story at the multiplayer blog at MTV.com.

2557
03:03:56,403 --> 03:03:57,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's see.

2558
03:03:58,665 --> 03:04:06,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Too Human was supposed to be the start of the next great expansive RPG franchise and the reasons that gamers were wanting Xbox 360 back in the early days.

2559
03:04:07,170 --> 03:04:35,596
[SPEAKER_09]: the Silicon Knights developed game was supposed to be a big deal but the game was delayed for two years the critical response to the game was less enthusiastic and what was intended to be a trilogy was dead on arrival with just 130,000 units sold and Microsoft ending their agreement with Silicon Knights I guess Silicon sued Epic Games over 2Human saying that Epic misrepresented the functionality of the Unreal Engine which was used for 2Human resulting in the two year delay wow interesting

2560
03:04:36,076 --> 03:04:45,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the case against Epic Games took a blow because one of the key witnesses was excluded from giving testimony after a ruling by Judge James Denver III.

2561
03:04:46,779 --> 03:05:00,823
[SPEAKER_09]: The testimony was going to break it down into dollars and cents terms what the negative impact of working with the Unreal Engine was supposed to have on Silicon Knights, but the testimony was found to be questionable and that the methods did not fit the facts of the case.

2562
03:05:01,423 --> 03:05:01,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2563
03:05:01,943 --> 03:05:03,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize there was all this drama going on.

2564
03:05:03,524 --> 03:05:05,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, this was a game that wasn't on my radar.

2565
03:05:05,786 --> 03:05:09,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe the fact that it wasn't on my radar is part of the reason why it didn't sell so good.

2566
03:05:09,469 --> 03:05:10,669
[SPEAKER_09]: But there you go.

2567
03:05:11,830 --> 03:05:12,110
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2568
03:05:12,190 --> 03:05:13,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

2569
03:05:13,751 --> 03:05:14,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2570
03:05:14,672 --> 03:05:15,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2571
03:05:16,153 --> 03:05:19,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, hey, you don't sound so good.

2572
03:05:19,215 --> 03:05:19,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Try again.

2573
03:05:19,956 --> 03:05:20,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2574
03:05:23,044 --> 03:05:25,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just me that doesn't hear that at all?

2575
03:05:25,425 --> 03:05:29,106
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really... You sound like a Dalek.

2576
03:05:29,186 --> 03:05:29,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't.

2577
03:05:29,667 --> 03:05:33,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping... Oh God, I hope that's... It was Zaku, obviously, that was calling in.

2578
03:05:33,648 --> 03:05:36,129
[SPEAKER_09]: He might have been able to make that out, but I couldn't understand him at all.

2579
03:05:36,649 --> 03:05:40,170
[SPEAKER_09]: No, neither could I. Now, was that his connection or was that ours?

2580
03:05:40,231 --> 03:05:41,851
[SPEAKER_09]: See, now all these things I'm going to question.

2581
03:05:41,911 --> 03:05:42,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the new studio setup?

2582
03:05:43,012 --> 03:05:44,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me just see real quick here.

2583
03:05:46,901 --> 03:05:47,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick here.

2584
03:05:48,002 --> 03:05:50,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, welcome to Skype call testing service.

2585
03:05:50,384 --> 03:05:51,245
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that works fine.

2586
03:05:51,325 --> 03:05:52,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, British lady.

2587
03:05:52,687 --> 03:05:53,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, British lady.

2588
03:05:53,888 --> 03:05:55,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if maybe this next call sounds a little cleaner.

2589
03:05:55,890 --> 03:05:56,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2590
03:05:56,711 --> 03:05:57,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2591
03:05:58,293 --> 03:06:03,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Derek H. Hi, Derek H. See, I can understand Derek just fine.

2592
03:06:03,879 --> 03:06:05,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Our last call was a little weird.

2593
03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:06,962
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow, Derek, what's on your mind, buddy?

2594
03:06:09,058 --> 03:06:10,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to talk about video games.

2595
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:11,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I've called you guys.

2596
03:06:12,982 --> 03:06:14,143
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this thing called Steam.

2597
03:06:14,163 --> 03:06:16,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've heard of it.

2598
03:06:16,565 --> 03:06:18,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, a friend was telling me about Steam.

2599
03:06:18,267 --> 03:06:19,108
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't play games.

2600
03:06:20,229 --> 03:06:21,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I play board games.

2601
03:06:21,070 --> 03:06:22,291
[SPEAKER_09]: We sure eat a lot of food though.

2602
03:06:22,311 --> 03:06:23,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to play some Risk?

2603
03:06:24,333 --> 03:06:25,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe Axis and Allies?

2604
03:06:26,415 --> 03:06:29,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking more about Wits and Wagers maybe.

2605
03:06:30,894 --> 03:06:31,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So Steam, yes.

2606
03:06:32,095 --> 03:06:33,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I've heard of Steam.

2607
03:06:33,376 --> 03:06:34,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the listeners do too.

2608
03:06:35,138 --> 03:06:44,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had Steam for a long time and I only buy games when they're like... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2609
03:06:44,847 --> 03:06:45,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Derek, you cut out.

2610
03:06:45,627 --> 03:06:48,470
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can hear me, you like totally cut out.

2611
03:06:48,890 --> 03:06:49,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like...

2612
03:06:49,798 --> 03:06:50,879
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell's going on?

2613
03:06:51,119 --> 03:06:55,342
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the void of calls.

2614
03:06:57,463 --> 03:06:58,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Your voice like dropped out.

2615
03:06:59,044 --> 03:07:01,686
[SPEAKER_09]: So did your mic come unplugged or something?

2616
03:07:04,548 --> 03:07:05,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, trying Derek again.

2617
03:07:06,009 --> 03:07:06,510
[SPEAKER_09]: One, two, three.

2618
03:07:06,570 --> 03:07:07,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I see that we're still connected.

2619
03:07:07,790 --> 03:07:08,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an internet thing.

2620
03:07:09,292 --> 03:07:11,353
[SPEAKER_09]: But he just, the voice dropped out.

2621
03:07:11,853 --> 03:07:13,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know if he can hear us.

2622
03:07:13,474 --> 03:07:13,915
[SPEAKER_09]: He hung up.

2623
03:07:14,795 --> 03:07:15,656
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a bummer.

2624
03:07:17,771 --> 03:07:23,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know what he was about to say about Steam, but I think it was like, I only buy games when... And I'm thinking it was maybe when they're on sale.

2625
03:07:23,894 --> 03:07:24,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dirt cheap.

2626
03:07:25,535 --> 03:07:25,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

2627
03:07:26,015 --> 03:07:29,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it was going to lead to a question about is that bad for the industry?

2628
03:07:29,657 --> 03:07:29,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2629
03:07:29,998 --> 03:07:30,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2630
03:07:30,518 --> 03:07:31,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure here real quick.

2631
03:07:31,779 --> 03:07:37,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just... Maybe this studio is a bad omen for calls.

2632
03:07:37,161 --> 03:07:37,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2633
03:07:37,442 --> 03:07:37,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

2634
03:07:37,982 --> 03:07:39,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Skype Core Testing Service.

2635
03:07:40,243 --> 03:07:42,264
[SPEAKER_04]: After the beep, please record a message.

2636
03:07:42,804 --> 03:07:45,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Afterwards, your message will be played back to you.

2637
03:07:46,277 --> 03:07:51,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm doing really professional internet radio right now, and I am testing a Skype connection live.

2638
03:07:51,963 --> 03:07:52,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you, British lady.

2639
03:07:54,385 --> 03:07:54,845
[SPEAKER_09]: On the air.

2640
03:07:56,287 --> 03:07:57,488
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all DarkSakura's fault.

2641
03:07:57,828 --> 03:08:02,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm doing really professional internet radio right now, and I am... See, it's fine.

2642
03:08:05,336 --> 03:08:05,696
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

2643
03:08:08,220 --> 03:08:10,365
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's up is this delicious stew.

2644
03:08:10,425 --> 03:08:11,127
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.

2645
03:08:11,207 --> 03:08:11,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

2646
03:08:12,009 --> 03:08:15,657
[SPEAKER_09]: The delicious pop is just put in front of my mouth begging me to eat.

2647
03:08:16,098 --> 03:08:17,040
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you make here?

2648
03:08:18,220 --> 03:08:28,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stew, cubed stew beef, small red potatoes, carrots, and I actually cut up two blood oranges and threw them in there.

2649
03:08:29,072 --> 03:08:30,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I can taste the citrus.

2650
03:08:30,153 --> 03:08:30,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I can taste it too, yeah.

2651
03:08:31,374 --> 03:08:34,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I used a peeler to get the rind, the orange.

2652
03:08:34,678 --> 03:08:35,158
[SPEAKER_02]: The zest.

2653
03:08:35,539 --> 03:08:35,919
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2654
03:08:35,979 --> 03:08:39,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's Orange Lounge Studio.

2655
03:08:39,303 --> 03:08:40,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

2656
03:08:42,666 --> 03:08:45,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, we're breaking up.

2657
03:08:45,469 --> 03:08:47,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had that in my head like all night.

2658
03:08:47,831 --> 03:08:50,954
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on to another call.

2659
03:08:51,554 --> 03:08:52,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this one will work.

2660
03:08:52,395 --> 03:08:53,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Ones Radio.

2661
03:08:53,236 --> 03:08:53,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2662
03:08:54,257 --> 03:08:54,897
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Shane.

2663
03:08:54,998 --> 03:08:58,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, so far we can hear you and you're not a robot, so that's good.

2664
03:08:58,241 --> 03:08:58,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Shane.

2665
03:08:59,101 --> 03:09:00,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome, I'm not a robot.

2666
03:09:00,643 --> 03:09:01,363
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

2667
03:09:01,443 --> 03:09:02,324
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, Shane?

2668
03:09:03,025 --> 03:09:03,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2669
03:09:03,806 --> 03:09:05,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I was calling to see if your stuff would work, pretty much.

2670
03:09:08,072 --> 03:09:10,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, only the collar appears to be broken this time.

2671
03:09:10,893 --> 03:09:14,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane, you need to come play with me on the Horde server.

2672
03:09:15,996 --> 03:09:18,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but there's so much Star Wars going on right now.

2673
03:09:18,977 --> 03:09:19,758
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2674
03:09:19,798 --> 03:09:20,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Poo on that.

2675
03:09:20,418 --> 03:09:21,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Then let's talk Star Wars.

2676
03:09:21,939 --> 03:09:24,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you were just telling me earlier, you do nothing but play Star Wars now.

2677
03:09:25,381 --> 03:09:26,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's really sad.

2678
03:09:27,001 --> 03:09:31,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I came on here and I said, you know, I like Star Wars and I don't like Star Wars for these particular reasons.

2679
03:09:31,644 --> 03:09:34,285
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are your thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic?

2680
03:09:34,818 --> 03:09:51,660
[SPEAKER_10]: well first of all I'd like to say I did not listen to what you said about why you like it and why you do not so I don't know if I'm going to copy you or anything but I like it because the story is really cool and I don't know anything about Star Wars so this is all new to me like every single last thing

2681
03:09:54,372 --> 03:09:55,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm still there.

2682
03:09:55,033 --> 03:09:56,534
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear stuff in the background.

2683
03:09:56,734 --> 03:09:57,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're just eating.

2684
03:09:57,555 --> 03:09:58,716
[SPEAKER_09]: We're stuffing our face while you're talking.

2685
03:09:58,836 --> 03:09:59,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's what I was doing.

2686
03:09:59,697 --> 03:10:00,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I was eating crappy McDonald's.

2687
03:10:00,438 --> 03:10:01,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to ask you long questions.

2688
03:10:03,861 --> 03:10:05,042
[SPEAKER_10]: That wasn't a very long question.

2689
03:10:05,062 --> 03:10:05,943
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2690
03:10:06,724 --> 03:10:14,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like it because it doesn't feel polished still, which is expected because it's such a new game.

2691
03:10:14,751 --> 03:10:16,713
[SPEAKER_10]: But that will come with time.

2692
03:10:16,893 --> 03:10:18,534
[SPEAKER_10]: WoW wasn't that great at vanilla.

2693
03:10:18,595 --> 03:10:19,655
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it a little bit.

2694
03:10:20,336 --> 03:10:46,506
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm really digging it like there's plot twists and every single class so far has been really fun to play which I can't say the same for WoW but I do love WoW I'm in a year commitment with WoW I have it like fully paid off with time cards so I don't really care if I'm not playing it right now so but I'm really enjoying Star Wars I just got a ship on one of my characters and it's pretty cool I'm eating

2695
03:10:50,737 --> 03:10:51,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So describe the glasses for us.

2696
03:10:52,958 --> 03:10:54,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, you pigs.

2697
03:10:56,780 --> 03:10:57,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2698
03:10:57,400 --> 03:10:58,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, some of us haven't had dinner.

2699
03:10:59,722 --> 03:11:04,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's what I was doing, and then I thought I would call in help to make sure your Skype was working.

2700
03:11:04,064 --> 03:11:04,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, no, no, no.

2701
03:11:04,964 --> 03:11:05,405
[SPEAKER_10]: No, hold on.

2702
03:11:05,545 --> 03:11:06,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I got another question for you.

2703
03:11:06,525 --> 03:11:06,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2704
03:11:07,666 --> 03:11:10,867
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is, what is supposed to happen in the endgame of Star Wars?

2705
03:11:11,108 --> 03:11:14,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, because I can't even figure out the non-endgame yet.

2706
03:11:15,110 --> 03:11:15,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Like...

2707
03:11:16,050 --> 03:11:19,352
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no hand-holding for the most part, except for at the very beginning.

2708
03:11:20,313 --> 03:11:30,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm just kind of pretending I know what I'm doing, and it's not working out so well in some situations, like some quests I kind of suck at.

2709
03:11:31,299 --> 03:11:31,800
[SPEAKER_10]: But oh well.

2710
03:11:33,321 --> 03:11:38,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen but maybe two level 50 characters, and their armor is ugly, so I don't even care about endgame yet.

2711
03:11:38,964 --> 03:11:39,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want story.

2712
03:11:41,886 --> 03:11:42,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Something just occurred to me.

2713
03:11:43,347 --> 03:11:43,527
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2714
03:11:43,807 --> 03:11:45,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sitting at a table eating.

2715
03:11:46,089 --> 03:11:46,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

2716
03:11:46,850 --> 03:11:47,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2717
03:11:47,510 --> 03:11:48,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Who does that anymore?

2718
03:11:49,211 --> 03:11:58,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So Shane, have you had any problems with like leveling up, like keeping your crafting up to level with what level you are and using the auction house?

2719
03:11:58,058 --> 03:12:02,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Rob, I haven't played it myself, but Rob was saying that he has trouble with how auction house works.

2720
03:12:03,462 --> 03:12:05,544
[SPEAKER_09]: The auction house is pretty terrible.

2721
03:12:05,564 --> 03:12:08,286
[SPEAKER_09]: The auction house works like Final Fantasy XI's auction house in some ways.

2722
03:12:08,626 --> 03:12:10,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a hybrid between XI and WoW.

2723
03:12:10,347 --> 03:12:10,748
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird.

2724
03:12:11,548 --> 03:12:28,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really like it, but the crafting, funny enough, I'm actually doing right now while I'm on this Skype stuff because I was not paying attention to it because part of the crafting aspect is that your companions do it and not you.

2725
03:12:28,905 --> 03:12:36,191
[SPEAKER_10]: So I now have two companions, so I can kind of do two things at once, but my companion, that's a...

2726
03:12:36,932 --> 03:12:45,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I can run around the world with and do stuff with and fight is my tank and I'm a healer so I kind of need him to not craft because he goes away when he crafts.

2727
03:12:46,216 --> 03:12:55,381
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just leveling up the little thing that makes lightsaber crystals right now because it's really, really far behind.

2728
03:12:57,062 --> 03:12:57,662
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like it.

2729
03:12:57,802 --> 03:12:59,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to get on our characters later and do flashpoints?

2730
03:13:00,711 --> 03:13:02,832
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2731
03:13:26,165 --> 03:13:29,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the starter flashpoints for both sides now.

2732
03:13:29,907 --> 03:13:38,273
[SPEAKER_10]: It's neat because you can completely change the outcome of that flashpoint story based on dialogue options.

2733
03:13:38,353 --> 03:13:45,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So all my characters, for the most part, are light side, even though they might be Imperial or Republic.

2734
03:13:45,578 --> 03:13:48,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So I save the captain from being killed.

2735
03:13:48,440 --> 03:13:50,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I save this general from being killed.

2736
03:13:50,381 --> 03:13:54,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I take this chick with me that the commander wants killed.

2737
03:13:55,164 --> 03:14:02,671
[SPEAKER_10]: So if my choice gets picked out of the random rolls, it affects the rest of the story for everybody for that specific flashpoint.

2738
03:14:03,511 --> 03:14:05,053
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really neat to me.

2739
03:14:05,173 --> 03:14:09,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't feel that long, even though I think they're like an hour long each.

2740
03:14:10,677 --> 03:14:19,945
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did just yesterday run a second flashpoint on one of my characters.

2741
03:14:19,985 --> 03:14:20,726
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember who.

2742
03:14:21,607 --> 03:14:23,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was very dull.

2743
03:14:23,592 --> 03:14:25,635
[SPEAKER_10]: because it was all brown.

2744
03:14:25,675 --> 03:14:30,981
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like playing Gears of War or any other FPS that's come out in the last couple years.

2745
03:14:32,026 --> 03:14:32,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2746
03:14:32,166 --> 03:14:32,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2747
03:15:02,361 --> 03:15:05,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say I ask myself that a lot when I cry myself to sleep at night.

2748
03:15:06,862 --> 03:15:07,182
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2749
03:15:08,643 --> 03:15:12,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, I should probably let you go soon so we can get other calls, hopefully.

2750
03:15:12,444 --> 03:15:15,685
[SPEAKER_09]: But do you have any other closing thoughts for us tonight, Shane?

2751
03:15:16,165 --> 03:15:22,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to participate in that top three games of the year thing on Facebook, and then I got lazy and didn't type anything out.

2752
03:15:23,427 --> 03:15:26,268
[SPEAKER_10]: But Portal 2 would have been my number one as well.

2753
03:15:26,548 --> 03:15:33,473
[SPEAKER_10]: After thinking about every single game that came out this year, I didn't sit through any other game from start to finish this year except for Portal.

2754
03:15:33,973 --> 03:15:44,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what we should have done is a top three most disappointing games of the year because there were a lot of hyped games that did not meet expectations at all.

2755
03:15:44,360 --> 03:15:45,761
[SPEAKER_09]: My number one would piss people off.

2756
03:15:47,182 --> 03:15:50,644
[SPEAKER_09]: My top three would probably make lots of people angry.

2757
03:15:50,664 --> 03:15:53,206
[SPEAKER_09]: You can make people angry because they can't send hate mail to you.

2758
03:15:53,726 --> 03:15:54,647
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's your top three?

2759
03:15:55,407 --> 03:15:56,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Most disappointing.

2760
03:15:56,648 --> 03:15:56,868
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

2761
03:16:26,912 --> 03:16:28,113
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you like Strider, right?

2762
03:16:29,614 --> 03:16:30,174
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

2763
03:16:30,194 --> 03:16:31,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Phoenix Wright.

2764
03:16:31,335 --> 03:16:31,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Phoenix Wright?

2765
03:16:32,136 --> 03:16:33,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2766
03:16:34,577 --> 03:16:35,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he can be wrong.

2767
03:16:37,299 --> 03:16:38,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You can choke on a potato, too.

2768
03:16:40,402 --> 03:16:41,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Dragon Age 2.

2769
03:16:42,723 --> 03:16:47,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe I've picked up every NPC that I can, I think.

2770
03:16:47,747 --> 03:16:52,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got off the mountain where Flemeth is there and you do the thing where Flemeth comes back.

2771
03:16:53,071 --> 03:16:56,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about the side characters like I did in Origins.

2772
03:16:56,897 --> 03:16:59,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the story's just not as good.

2773
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:01,101
[SPEAKER_10]: The combat's more fun.

2774
03:17:02,022 --> 03:17:03,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I own it on PC and PS3.

2775
03:17:03,924 --> 03:17:05,385
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how much I cared about Dragon Age 1.

2776
03:17:05,445 --> 03:17:06,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, oh, I love 2.

2777
03:17:06,666 --> 03:17:07,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be awesome.

2778
03:17:07,987 --> 03:17:08,188
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2779
03:17:09,309 --> 03:17:14,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna beat it simply because I'm committed to the world that they've built, but the writing isn't as good.

2780
03:17:15,396 --> 03:17:15,576
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2781
03:17:15,836 --> 03:17:16,117
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2782
03:17:16,537 --> 03:17:17,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, I got to let you go so we can get more calls.

2783
03:17:18,018 --> 03:17:18,558
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

2784
03:17:18,578 --> 03:17:19,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, okay?

2785
03:17:19,759 --> 03:17:20,039
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

2786
03:17:20,059 --> 03:17:20,300
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2787
03:17:20,320 --> 03:17:20,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2788
03:17:21,741 --> 03:17:22,141
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2789
03:17:22,181 --> 03:17:23,842
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go to some more calls.

2790
03:17:23,882 --> 03:17:24,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

2791
03:17:25,483 --> 03:17:26,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try this again.

2792
03:17:27,025 --> 03:17:28,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

2793
03:17:28,125 --> 03:17:28,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2794
03:17:29,326 --> 03:17:29,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

2795
03:17:29,646 --> 03:17:31,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Derek H. from Virginia Beach.

2796
03:17:31,508 --> 03:17:32,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to hear from you again.

2797
03:17:33,029 --> 03:17:33,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what happened before.

2798
03:17:34,010 --> 03:17:35,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a weird internet thing.

2799
03:17:36,559 --> 03:17:37,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame Skype.

2800
03:17:37,459 --> 03:17:40,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's free, so you can't blame Skype, but I still blame Skype.

2801
03:17:40,441 --> 03:17:40,741
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2802
03:17:40,781 --> 03:17:50,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you were talking about Steam, and you were about to say, you were talking about, I only buy games on Steam when... They're on sale, and that is a huge mistake.

2803
03:17:50,565 --> 03:17:52,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I should only buy games on Steam.

2804
03:17:53,246 --> 03:17:54,486
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'll say this about everybody.

2805
03:17:54,506 --> 03:18:00,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody should only buy games on Steam when they're full price, because then you know that you actually want that game.

2806
03:18:01,308 --> 03:18:06,857
[SPEAKER_03]: because I have a... Now, after the last week, I have like eight games I'm never gonna play again.

2807
03:18:09,242 --> 03:18:10,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought two games.

2808
03:18:10,384 --> 03:18:12,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought... I looked and I said, oh, wow.

2809
03:18:14,209 --> 03:18:16,790
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two flight sims for only $3 a piece.

2810
03:18:17,010 --> 03:18:22,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I looked and I have a flight stick that had fallen behind my desk like a year ago.

2811
03:18:22,352 --> 03:18:25,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never even bothered to reach it.

2812
03:18:25,593 --> 03:18:28,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I picked it up, it had a layer of dust on it.

2813
03:18:28,094 --> 03:18:29,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, oh, wait, I have a flight stick.

2814
03:18:30,475 --> 03:18:31,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I must like flight sims.

2815
03:18:32,075 --> 03:18:36,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bought those games, played them for 20 minutes and realized I hate flight sims.

2816
03:18:36,917 --> 03:18:38,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hand if you've been there.

2817
03:18:39,738 --> 03:19:06,781
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier this year I think it was the Thanksgiving sale they had Dead Space 1 and 2 in a combo pack for like 4 or 5 bucks and I was like alright Dead Space you know Resident Evil with aliens or ghosts in outer space I'll buy that I had already bought it completely forgot that I had bought the rights to download that on my Steam same with Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition it's like oh yeah dirt cheap 3 bucks I get my credit card out oh yeah you bought that 6 months ago but you forgot about it instantly afterward

2818
03:19:08,001 --> 03:19:09,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely have that problem.

2819
03:19:10,122 --> 03:19:14,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Knights of the Old Republic on the Xbox version, but you can play it on the 360.

2820
03:19:15,704 --> 03:19:17,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought that two years ago.

2821
03:19:18,125 --> 03:19:18,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, four years ago.

2822
03:19:19,005 --> 03:19:19,565
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time ago.

2823
03:19:20,346 --> 03:19:20,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.

2824
03:19:21,406 --> 03:19:24,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of the few people that cannot stand KOTOR.

2825
03:19:25,047 --> 03:19:27,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it on Steam.

2826
03:19:27,248 --> 03:19:27,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only $2.50.

2827
03:19:28,168 --> 03:19:33,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually struggle with myself not to buy it.

2828
03:19:33,210 --> 03:19:34,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I own this game.

2829
03:19:34,511 --> 03:19:35,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.

2830
03:19:35,911 --> 03:19:45,334
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's only $2.50 You posted on Facebook or Google or something about that Because I remember reading that One of my friends worked on that game Really?

2831
03:19:45,414 --> 03:19:46,115
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what she called it?

2832
03:19:46,195 --> 03:19:46,435
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2833
03:19:46,595 --> 03:20:01,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Scrotor But hey, while she was working on it, we got to go to the Skywalker Ranch Oh, that's when you flung the meatball at George Lucas No, when I wanted to fling meatloaf at George Lucas He walked by and I could have flung meatloaf at him I changed the story a little bit, I embellished

2834
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:02,320
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, Derek?

2835
03:20:02,500 --> 03:20:05,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I did something similar during this most recent Steam sale.

2836
03:20:05,361 --> 03:20:07,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought Quake Collection.

2837
03:20:07,361 --> 03:20:08,762
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't just buy one Quake game.

2838
03:20:08,802 --> 03:20:10,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought Quake 1, 2, and 3.

2839
03:20:11,082 --> 03:20:12,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Quake 2 isn't even that good.

2840
03:20:12,903 --> 03:20:19,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And Quake 1 and 3 were good like 10 years ago, but playing them now, like my video card doesn't know how to handle Quake 3.

2841
03:20:19,705 --> 03:20:21,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I was having problems getting Quake 3 to even work.

2842
03:20:22,385 --> 03:20:25,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Why am I buying Quake 3 when I can just go play Quake live?

2843
03:20:27,205 --> 03:20:34,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost bought... When they had a thing where you can buy all the Star Wars games or something for like $14, I was like, that's a great deal.

2844
03:20:35,432 --> 03:20:43,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I had no interest in buying these games when they came out or the years afterwards, all of a sudden I think I kind of need these games.

2845
03:20:44,179 --> 03:20:45,800
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's how they get people.

2846
03:20:46,040 --> 03:20:46,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

2847
03:20:46,921 --> 03:20:52,222
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this happens in our culture all the time, is that people want to see that they're getting a good deal.

2848
03:20:52,302 --> 03:20:55,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, for example, look at all the hilarity that happened on Black Friday.

2849
03:20:55,423 --> 03:21:06,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure everybody here saw the video, Derek, I'm assuming you probably saw this too, of the people at Walmart that were practically jumping on top of each other and clawing each other's eye outs over $2 waffle irons.

2850
03:21:07,105 --> 03:21:10,706
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, who really needs a waffle iron?

2851
03:21:10,966 --> 03:21:13,987
[SPEAKER_09]: How many days out of the year do you make waffles at home?

2852
03:21:14,347 --> 03:21:14,467
Yeah.

2853
03:21:14,887 --> 03:21:16,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Yourself, you know?

2854
03:21:16,408 --> 03:21:18,790
[SPEAKER_09]: How many days last year did you make waffles?

2855
03:21:19,330 --> 03:21:21,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have a friend that makes waffles.

2856
03:21:21,472 --> 03:21:21,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But not you.

2857
03:21:22,152 --> 03:21:22,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Weekly.

2858
03:21:23,013 --> 03:21:24,434
[SPEAKER_09]: You make waffles weekly?

2859
03:21:25,655 --> 03:21:29,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I... Would you trust a $2 waffle iron to make waffles?

2860
03:21:29,618 --> 03:21:30,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2861
03:21:30,198 --> 03:21:32,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it was a recognized brand and a Rudolph.

2862
03:21:32,320 --> 03:21:36,543
[SPEAKER_09]: But why do people want to kill each other over a $2 waffle iron?

2863
03:21:36,603 --> 03:21:36,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's $2.

2864
03:21:37,023 --> 03:21:40,606
[SPEAKER_03]: If you waffle that much, then you don't want waffles from a $2 waffle iron.

2865
03:21:40,626 --> 03:21:40,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2866
03:21:43,916 --> 03:21:57,345
[SPEAKER_09]: We won a waffle iron at a white elephant exchange and Alan actually tried to make waffles with it and he got so frustrated he was cussing at this cheap white elephant waffle maker that makes little circus animal waffles.

2867
03:21:58,464 --> 03:22:02,046
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, sorry, I'm totally going on a tangent.

2868
03:22:02,106 --> 03:22:03,087
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what I mean.

2869
03:22:03,107 --> 03:22:06,629
[SPEAKER_09]: In our culture, people want to get things just because it's a good deal.

2870
03:22:06,869 --> 03:22:10,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Becky just messaged me and says, I make waffles at least twice a month.

2871
03:22:11,351 --> 03:22:13,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But Becky is also a great cook.

2872
03:22:13,833 --> 03:22:15,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she has a really good waffle iron.

2873
03:22:15,534 --> 03:22:16,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be surprised at all.

2874
03:22:16,955 --> 03:22:20,296
[SPEAKER_09]: She probably has a lot of great cooking things that most people don't have.

2875
03:22:23,452 --> 03:22:25,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, you look like you're dying to say something over there.

2876
03:22:26,295 --> 03:22:47,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too lazy to look it up, but there's actually a clinical term culturally for when in times of financial hardship, like when the economy's in a shitter, just when people are broke, they'll go to the gas station when they fill up their car with a tank of gas and they'll buy a candy bar and they're not even hungry, but it's just an 89 cent thing that makes them feel good that they bought this little...

2877
03:22:49,194 --> 03:23:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: this little thing that just makes them feel better because it's cheap and Steam is a great outlet for that impulse that we have where I need to buy something, I'm tired of being broke or this is only a dollar so who fucking cares Retail therapy, really, I mean, in the end So you're saying I bought Wings of Prey because I'm clinically depressed is what you're saying?

2878
03:23:15,376 --> 03:23:20,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's quite that.

2879
03:23:21,530 --> 03:23:24,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we could make that conclusion here on the show.

2880
03:23:27,013 --> 03:23:29,155
[SPEAKER_02]: People are just driven if something is cheap.

2881
03:23:31,176 --> 03:23:36,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it feels good to spend a little bit of money, even if it's something that you know that you ultimately won't.

2882
03:23:36,499 --> 03:23:41,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I do it all the time, but yeah, if you make something cheap enough, people will buy it whether they want it or not.

2883
03:23:42,042 --> 03:23:50,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it would be a good policy moving forward for people, before you buy a Steam game, you need to walk away for an hour.

2884
03:23:50,467 --> 03:23:50,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2885
03:23:51,764 --> 03:23:55,407
[SPEAKER_09]: and then say after an hour, okay, do I still really want that game?

2886
03:23:55,447 --> 03:23:56,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the answer is yes, then you buy it.

2887
03:23:57,308 --> 03:23:59,429
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do it because they have that countdown on the screen.

2888
03:23:59,529 --> 03:24:00,790
[SPEAKER_03]: The number's going down.

2889
03:24:01,731 --> 03:24:03,492
[SPEAKER_07]: What if I only have 57 minutes?

2890
03:24:03,572 --> 03:24:07,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think I just bought Bastion at the start of the show?

2891
03:24:07,890 --> 03:24:27,498
[SPEAKER_09]: and I even told you I said wait till you get home click done bitch alright Derek good luck with your Steam I don't want to say addiction but your Steam issues we'll say and hey at least I hope you're getting to play some great games out of it even if just for 20 minutes

2892
03:24:29,045 --> 03:24:31,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go play VVV right after the show

2893
03:24:42,049 --> 03:24:46,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the big battles, the multi-community gaming tournament.

2894
03:24:46,892 --> 03:24:57,059
[SPEAKER_03]: You should do it because gaming is about having fun, and you have more fun, I believe, when you're competing, and even more fun when you're competing for something you enjoy.

2895
03:24:58,440 --> 03:25:05,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you get to represent your favorite podcast or whatever and say, hey, we're the best.

2896
03:25:06,192 --> 03:25:07,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Mortal Kombat players.

2897
03:25:07,673 --> 03:25:08,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not even we're the best.

2898
03:25:09,053 --> 03:25:14,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really you're the best, but it's something you can hold up over somebody else's head.

2899
03:25:14,055 --> 03:25:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of nice.

2900
03:25:15,376 --> 03:25:18,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always fun when you can compete against your friends.

2901
03:25:18,757 --> 03:25:20,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And also you get to meet new people.

2902
03:25:20,778 --> 03:25:22,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to play against people you probably wouldn't have.

2903
03:25:22,639 --> 03:25:25,840
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been playing games against the same 20 people for the last four years.

2904
03:25:25,860 --> 03:25:28,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you get to play against some other people who share the same interests as you.

2905
03:25:28,881 --> 03:25:29,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good thing.

2906
03:25:29,582 --> 03:25:30,162
[SPEAKER_03]: The big battle done.

2907
03:25:30,442 --> 03:25:31,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's great.

2908
03:25:32,185 --> 03:25:32,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I signed up to play.

2909
03:25:33,086 --> 03:25:35,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not signing up because I'm not going to win.

2910
03:25:35,229 --> 03:25:35,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are we kidding here?

2911
03:25:35,990 --> 03:25:37,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll probably get knocked out the first round.

2912
03:25:38,734 --> 03:25:41,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I may not be the best, but I can be the loudest.

2913
03:25:42,543 --> 03:26:10,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for the Mortal Kombat ones the ringers are the guys from Spooky Hour Horror Hour who love not only horror games but like everything about horror so they live and breathe Mortal Kombat so I think they're probably going to be the winners there but you know what it's good to take to like throw a knife in Tedekin's throat every couple of days that'll be fun alright well Derek I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show but thank you so much for the call

2914
03:26:11,547 --> 03:26:13,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for doing a show so late tonight

2915
03:26:33,650 --> 03:26:34,591
[SPEAKER_09]: We finished tweets.

2916
03:26:35,331 --> 03:26:36,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Last minute stories.

2917
03:26:36,532 --> 03:26:37,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually I turn to Loki for that.

2918
03:26:37,992 --> 03:26:38,593
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not here.

2919
03:26:38,953 --> 03:26:41,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I anticipate Alan probably didn't dig anything up.

2920
03:26:41,154 --> 03:26:41,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one.

2921
03:26:42,555 --> 03:26:47,737
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a clarification about the Final Fantasy X HD remake that Squeenix announced in September.

2922
03:26:49,578 --> 03:26:53,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess one of the developers or producers was asked for a timeline.

2923
03:26:53,786 --> 03:27:02,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, just to make this clear, the Final Fantasy X remake isn't just a texture cleanup and a resolution upscaling.

2924
03:27:02,972 --> 03:27:04,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a remake.

2925
03:27:04,433 --> 03:27:07,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So redrawing of 10.

2926
03:27:08,155 --> 03:27:12,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So redrawing of assets, cleaning up the script, new voiceover work.

2927
03:27:12,778 --> 03:27:13,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the real deal.

2928
03:27:13,819 --> 03:27:17,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So what everybody wanted from Final Fantasy 7... 10 is getting.

2929
03:27:18,082 --> 03:27:18,522
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 is getting.

2930
03:27:18,642 --> 03:27:18,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2931
03:27:19,383 --> 03:27:19,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just do 7.

2932
03:27:20,003 --> 03:27:20,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

2933
03:27:21,864 --> 03:27:22,665
[SPEAKER_09]: How about do six?

2934
03:27:22,785 --> 03:27:26,167
[SPEAKER_09]: So people thought... How about let's really remake a game?

2935
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:28,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take one like six or four.

2936
03:27:28,189 --> 03:27:30,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, four I guess got the DS remake, but six.

2937
03:27:31,271 --> 03:27:33,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Six is begging for a really, really awesome remake.

2938
03:27:34,114 --> 03:27:35,154
[SPEAKER_09]: So, interesting.

2939
03:27:35,615 --> 03:27:36,275
[SPEAKER_09]: That just came out?

2940
03:27:36,916 --> 03:27:38,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, story's dated today.

2941
03:27:38,277 --> 03:27:38,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2942
03:27:38,868 --> 03:27:39,809
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2943
03:27:55,151 --> 03:28:00,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of that stuff got really out of control.

2944
03:28:00,414 --> 03:28:02,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a slow news week or what?

2945
03:28:05,158 --> 03:28:10,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of it's been discussed a lot and I don't know what else there is to add to that.

2946
03:28:10,561 --> 03:28:16,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, I think Loki really wants to talk about it because he's actually used that controller that's at the core of it.

2947
03:28:17,045 --> 03:28:30,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I think although it's important to distinguish between the individual that doesn't know how to deal with customers whatsoever and the device itself, Loki has used the device itself and really wanted to comment on it.

2948
03:28:30,194 --> 03:28:33,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm kind of pushing that back to next week so we can discuss that a little more.

2949
03:28:34,237 --> 03:28:39,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So just so you know, I just wanted to say, yes, I'm aware that that happened in the gaming world this week, but at the same time,

2950
03:28:42,443 --> 03:28:42,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2951
03:28:42,763 --> 03:28:44,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I might get shit for this, but whatever.

2952
03:28:44,724 --> 03:28:46,686
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really gaming news.

2953
03:28:47,046 --> 03:29:00,757
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gaming community news and gaming community events, and I get why people are following it, but it's just horrible train wreck, Rikki Lake holding her hand against the face with the jaw dropped, all that stuff.

2954
03:29:00,997 --> 03:29:01,097
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

2955
03:29:02,498 --> 03:29:04,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe you just made a Ricky Lake reference.

2956
03:29:04,580 --> 03:29:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Ricky.

2957
03:29:05,420 --> 03:29:05,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Ricky.

2958
03:29:06,241 --> 03:29:06,541
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2959
03:29:07,742 --> 03:29:13,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say, though, since Derek had just called in, Dead Pixel Live actually got the guy on the show.

2960
03:29:14,427 --> 03:29:16,289
[SPEAKER_09]: And from what I understand, he apologized.

2961
03:29:16,569 --> 03:29:19,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So at that token, what else is there to say if he's apologized?

2962
03:29:20,032 --> 03:29:24,916
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also kind of think... I feel bad because I have no idea what this is about.

2963
03:29:25,056 --> 03:29:25,556
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2964
03:29:25,636 --> 03:29:26,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find out next week.

2965
03:29:26,917 --> 03:29:29,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Or go listen to Dead Pixel Live show from Thursday.

2966
03:29:29,139 --> 03:29:29,739
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

2967
03:29:29,759 --> 03:29:30,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

2968
03:29:30,600 --> 03:29:41,369
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole debacle is interesting, but at the same time, I think had this happened in November when Skyrim and all these things were coming out, it wouldn't have been as big of a thing.

2969
03:29:42,390 --> 03:29:47,895
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a good job covering it in a more timely manner since they were able to get the guy on the day after it happened.

2970
03:29:48,776 --> 03:29:51,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what we could contribute to that conversation.

2971
03:29:52,319 --> 03:29:53,440
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been five days.

2972
03:29:53,480 --> 03:29:54,861
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an eternity in internet time.

2973
03:29:55,922 --> 03:29:56,242
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2974
03:29:57,843 --> 03:29:58,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2975
03:30:00,296 --> 03:30:02,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're ready to wrap it up.

2976
03:30:02,777 --> 03:30:07,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can't really wrap it up and put a bow on it and call it done until everybody has given their final thoughts.

2977
03:30:08,060 --> 03:30:09,480
[SPEAKER_09]: So Alan, I'll start with you.

2978
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:12,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much as always for filling in for a host who is not here.

2979
03:30:13,422 --> 03:30:14,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

2980
03:30:14,402 --> 03:30:17,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that the show is in your house, maybe you'll stop by once in a while and say hello.

2981
03:30:18,464 --> 03:30:24,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or when Loki's here, I'll just play, you know, on the TV the whole time and ignore the show entirely.

2982
03:30:24,566 --> 03:30:29,028
[SPEAKER_09]: When we get the video going, we can have you playing a game and, you know, kind of talk about that and we'll see.

2983
03:30:29,228 --> 03:30:29,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2984
03:30:29,508 --> 03:30:31,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2985
03:30:34,750 --> 03:30:34,870
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2986
03:30:35,570 --> 03:30:35,830
Okay.

2987
03:30:36,950 --> 03:30:37,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing to plug?

2988
03:30:37,670 --> 03:30:37,751
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2989
03:30:37,811 --> 03:30:38,171
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2990
03:30:38,371 --> 03:30:38,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

2991
03:30:40,331 --> 03:30:48,034
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought tonight is I haven't had Hanson's soda in a while, but now that I'm having this delicious black cherry soda, I've kind of missed it.

2992
03:30:49,246 --> 03:30:53,312
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight I love reading the stories on unicornbooty.com

2993
03:30:56,181 --> 03:30:56,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2994
03:30:57,922 --> 03:30:59,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I have another final thought.

2995
03:30:59,843 --> 03:31:02,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Last night, New Year's Eve, we watched a lot of Adventure Time.

2996
03:31:03,665 --> 03:31:04,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what it's called?

2997
03:31:04,225 --> 03:31:04,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Adventure Time?

2998
03:31:05,546 --> 03:31:07,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Adventure Time with Finn and Jake.

2999
03:31:07,167 --> 03:31:08,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that show is pretty fucking funny.

3000
03:31:08,687 --> 03:31:09,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that.

3001
03:31:09,328 --> 03:31:09,808
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good show.

3002
03:31:10,248 --> 03:31:10,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's it.

3003
03:31:11,209 --> 03:31:11,669
[SPEAKER_09]: We're done.

3004
03:31:11,769 --> 03:31:12,669
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back next week.

3005
03:31:12,909 --> 03:31:17,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki will be back finally next week and we'll get his top three and plenty more gaming news.

3006
03:31:18,012 --> 03:31:19,173
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're into a new year.

3007
03:31:20,133 --> 03:31:24,355
[SPEAKER_09]: The news is going to start to come out as we get into the first quarter releases and E3 in the summer.

3008
03:31:26,456 --> 03:31:30,559
[SPEAKER_09]: all towards another Clusterfucker releases in October, November of 2012 right before the world ends.

3009
03:31:31,119 --> 03:31:32,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a wonderful week everybody.

3010
03:31:32,280 --> 03:31:34,342
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

3011
03:31:34,362 --> 03:31:34,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.

[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
