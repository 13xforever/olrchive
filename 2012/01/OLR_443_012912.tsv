0	21000	Tonight, January 29, 2012, a network makeover is rumored for Nintendo consoles, a new handheld
21000	31600	may bring back a classic gaming system, and Steam goes mobile with a new iOS app.
31600	35160	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35160	39040	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39040	47720	We are live on this January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.
47720	51720	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.
51720	55360	First off, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55360	56360	Hi.
56360	57360	How are you, Miss Summers?
57360	58360	Been better.
58360	59360	Been better?
59360	65120	It's kind of a gloomy Sunday, Sunday Bloody Sunday, like the U2 song.
65120	74960	No, there's no big massacres and wars going on in my house and I don't live in Ireland
74960	78080	as people I'm sure would know that's what the song was about.
78080	80800	That was not a PMS joke because that would be gross.
80800	85960	I could say it's Shark Week.
85960	88040	Are the communists invading?
88040	89440	That's none of anyone's business.
89440	91440	However, I am very pissy.
91440	92440	I'm sorry.
92440	96120	Well, so this week everybody better be extra careful on their spelling and grammar because
96120	99760	remember it's those little things that'll tick her off unless she gets chocolate.
99760	103560	Everything has been pissing me off today, so it's going to be a great show.
103560	104560	I'm sorry.
104560	107600	I didn't help because we were supposed to have a Pinkberry date today and I had to cancel
107600	113320	because my mommy just had surgery and I know she doesn't listen to the show, but I'm thinking
113320	114320	about my mother.
114320	118040	She had surgery on Friday, but she's doing a lot better, so I had to go visit her today
118040	120760	because she's out of the hospital.
120760	124000	Anyhow, let's talk about who else is here with us here in studio.
124000	125520	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
125520	126520	Hi.
126520	127520	How are you, Techmaster Loki?
127520	128520	I'm fine.
128520	129520	Are you on your period or are we good?
129520	132280	I'm fine, I guess.
132280	134440	You're always angry on this show no matter what it is.
134440	138080	I was like, I don't know how to answer that.
138080	139080	Yes.
139080	140520	What's new with Loki?
140520	143080	Um, not much.
143080	144080	Just playing Skyrim.
144080	145080	All right.
145080	147840	Well, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit, but first I have to plug
147840	153600	of course the lovely All Games Radio where we do our show every week, www.allgames.com
153600	157420	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
157420	158860	It is where we tape live.
158860	162680	If you are listening live, and we hope you do sometime if you are been listening on the
162680	166280	podcast all these years, if you are listening live, join us in our chat room.
166280	171080	Just point your browsers over to chat dot orange lounge radio.com and there's a fine
171080	173960	little Java chat room that will open right up and you can join our chat room.
173960	177600	If you prefer to do it the old school way, you can do it with an IRC client still because
177600	182200	our chat rooms IRC based and you just want to connect to the game surge network at IRC
182200	188480	dot game surge.net and we are in channel with the channel sign or the pound orange lounge
188480	190560	is where you can find us on IRC.
190560	191560	Hey Rob.
191560	192560	Hey Rob.
192560	193560	Yes ma'am.
193560	196120	I have to share the neat thing that I just posted in the chat room.
196120	197120	Okay.
197120	200960	Apparently some nerd has narrowed down when Ice Cube's good day was.
200960	202600	Like today was a good day?
202600	203600	What day was it?
203600	204600	Well, I'll just.
204600	205600	Wasn't today right?
205600	207200	I'll go through just a quickie on this one.
207200	213400	The clues were what they were watching UMTV wraps, which started on August 6th, 1988.
213400	218480	The single was released on February 23rd, 93 and the Lakers beat the Supersonics.
218480	222760	So they narrowed down all of those dates and then went to clue for the dates.
222760	226720	The Laker wins over the Supersonics was a clear day with no smog.
226720	233340	So they narrowed it down to November 30th, 88 and at the date in 89, 91 and 92 good Lord.
233340	235240	Some people have too much free time.
235240	237880	Clue five got a beep from Kim.
237880	239440	So it was when beepers were available.
239440	246800	So that led it to two dates, uh, January 18th, 91, January 20th, 92 clue six Ice Cube started
246800	251720	filming boys in the hood in 1991 there was only one day I'm going to quote this only
251720	254520	one day where UMTV wraps was on air.
254520	256200	It was a clear and smog less day.
256200	259960	Beepers were commercially sold Lakers beat the Supersonics and Ice Cube had no events
259960	266160	to attend January 20th, 1992 national good day day.
266160	271120	So we just celebrated 20 years of today was a good day 20 years ago.
271120	272360	Yeah.
272360	276260	What an incredibly useless piece of information, but I thought it was cool that someone went
276260	278000	to the trouble and I wanted to share it.
278000	279000	That's when the good day was.
279000	282000	And those, and for those listening to orange on radio for the first time, those are the
282000	286400	lovely types of tidbits you can expect, but we will get into video games here in a minute.
286400	289000	First I have to apologize to livelicious and the podcasters.
289000	291600	There was no live show last week and it was a little bit last minute.
291600	295160	We had to cancel the show due to illness and I was a little bit self-conscious about it
295160	296160	last week.
296160	298680	I didn't want to talk about a whole lot, but I'll talk about it now.
298680	304440	I had pink eye, which is why we didn't have the show last week or is what, what did Victoria
304440	306360	call it I herps or something like that.
306360	315480	Look dark soccer just choked on her soda when I said that.
315480	319960	It's like, what am I seven and going to a preschool where kids are putting fingers in
319960	321920	their butt and their eye or something.
321920	325520	No, I work in a place with adults and stuff.
325520	326520	I don't know.
326520	327720	We had a pink eye outbreak at work.
327720	329200	It just ended plague.
329200	330600	I don't know what happened.
330600	332100	Someone got careless with the mascara.
332100	338000	I got pink because I w I do work with primarily women and I got pink guy just cause everybody
338000	339280	else in the office had it.
339280	343560	So unfortunately what that means is that nobody wants to come over to Rob's house where the
343560	348120	studio is or touch the equipment and everything like that because he has pink eye and when
348120	352240	one co-host has a kid at home and you know, the other just doesn't want pink eye, it kind
352240	353480	of fucks up the show for the night.
353480	356000	Oh no, you are, you, I was eating cheesecake.
356000	360320	Fuck your pink eye.
360320	361980	You had something else going on anyway.
361980	366360	You were going to miss two weeks in a row anyway because there was a, a family deal.
366360	367360	Yeah.
367360	375320	And um, I, uh, it was a cousin's birthday at the cheesecake factory and I had fantastic
375320	378380	carrot cake cheesecake and Dan had food poisoning.
378380	382880	So um, and of course our chat room is lighting up pink guy, what the hell?
382880	385440	And uh, Kai's Judo's like, all it was, was pink eye WTF.
385440	386440	Yes.
386440	389180	But you have to remember pink eye is super duper contagious.
389180	392880	Like it's not like I lick the eyes of these women I work with.
392880	397480	Like if you touch something they've touched, you can get it like break room stuff, you
397480	398480	know?
398480	406340	So, so yeah, yeah, yet Alan who lives here with me never got it.
406340	407840	So I don't know what that's about.
407840	411360	Maybe you have natural immunity to the undead plague.
411360	413800	You will be the salvation of us all.
413800	418840	And I actually wiped down all of the mics and the studio area with Clark's wipes to
418840	419840	make sure.
419840	420840	You're so considerate.
420840	421840	Yeah.
421840	422840	I never got pink eye.
422840	423840	So Rob's lying.
423840	424840	This whole story is a lie.
424840	430200	I had a very, very minor case of pink eye and yet it was like Alan went through here
430200	434440	in a hazmat suit making sure he would not get it no matter what happened.
434440	441840	So um, uh, Hamakara in our chat room at chat.orange.com says someone wasn't washing their hands after
441840	442840	using the potty.
442840	443840	Okay.
443840	447400	First off, I find that to be one of the most disgusting habits of men that I see in the
447400	453080	potty is that I see guys who just walk in the restroom, do their thing, walk right out.
453080	454080	They don't even flush.
454080	456080	They don't even stop to walk, wash their hands.
456080	459840	And if that's you, especially if they're handling their junk or something, you know, and you
459840	460840	know who you are.
460840	461840	That's gross.
461840	464640	A flush B wash.
464640	465640	It's not that hard.
465640	472080	Although I will say it has been proven that the place with the most germs on the body
472080	474860	is actually the mouth and the hands.
474860	477600	So you were right about not washing the hands regularly.
477600	481760	However the butt is one of the cleanest places.
481760	483780	Thank you for that piece of information.
483780	484880	So what have I learned today?
484880	489180	January 20th was a good day and my ass is kind of clean after all.
489180	490180	Thank you.
490180	491180	And urine is sterile.
491180	492180	All right.
492180	496800	Anyhow, I don't want to talk about my goddamn pink eye anymore.
496800	499640	Let's talk about, uh, let's talk about gaming.
499640	500720	I don't want to get into our gaming weeks.
500720	504520	I want to get right into the gaming news tonight or actually we can talk about one of two things
504520	510040	because we could talk about what's going on with Xbox and all these rumors about the new
510040	513560	Xbox and, and the, the used games and all that.
513560	517760	Or we could talk about RuPaul's drag race season four premiers tomorrow, which is the
517760	518760	best show on television.
518760	519760	Am I right?
519760	520760	Dark soccer.
520760	521760	Yeah, but there's really nothing.
521760	523520	I interviewed Tatiana once.
523520	526460	There's really nothing to talk about until it airs though.
526460	530400	That's true, but we can, so I guess, I guess we'll, we'll just combine the two worlds a
530400	531400	little bit.
531400	554560	I tried, all right, so going around an Xbox bullshit this week, I don't know.
554560	558080	It might be true, but look, I, it's the pink elephant in the room.
558080	559080	Everybody's talking about it.
559080	563840	It's the whole, the new Xbox, which we're called, we will not call it the Xbox 720 here
563840	564840	on orange on radio.
564840	565840	I'm sorry.
565840	566840	That's not what it's going to be called.
566840	571000	We already decided weeks ago amongst a highly scientific process, we will refer to the system
571000	574120	as the Xbox lube until Microsoft gives us something better.
574120	579180	So the Xbox lube supposedly is not going to play, use games whatsoever that I guess there's
579180	586920	this amazing technology that will just fuck your disc up once you install a game or something
586920	591480	like Loki clue us all in, how is this technology supposed to work from what I don't fucking
591480	592480	know.
592480	593480	It doesn't exist.
593480	598920	So how am I, it's going to use these cardboard rings.
598920	604500	Basically what happens is they'll prompt you to enter in, um, a special code that's generated
604500	610440	by turning these rings so that, you know, you can create a certain phrase like for example,
610440	616000	you know, banana monkey pirate, or you'll have to get out the instruction manual and
616000	623780	look up the keyword on page 24, some of which may actually require the use of a decoder
623780	632360	device that will be a red plastic, a transparent piece of, um, of, uh, yeah, it's, it's, I
632360	634360	don't know codes.
634360	635360	I okay.
635360	636360	No.
636360	640200	What I think I was reading about what's supposed to happen is it's supposed to be that the
640200	647920	X box would have a burner in it, that the drive functions is both a burner and a reader.
647920	652560	And once you play the game for the first time, it would basically burn your console cereal
652560	654340	into the disc.
654340	656880	And at that point it would only work on that console.
656880	661680	And I'm like, that has got to be the most hideous idea I've ever heard.
661680	666320	Like really like, so I can't take a disc over to a friend's house anymore and play the game.
666320	670200	I mean, that's how crazy we're getting.
670200	671720	It's not going to happen.
671720	677600	I just, just even the way that they say that that's how that's going to work is retarded.
677600	685880	I mean, it's just, it's no, not even close to how it's going to work or they're not going
685880	686880	to do that.
686880	687880	Okay.
687880	691560	First off, you know, you have companies like GameStop, basically if Microsoft were to do
691560	696480	that on system, that would cut out the whole used business altogether, which is a good
696480	700920	portion of where the revenue is for GameStop.
700920	707280	I mean, who is by far the biggest company out there selling games to consumers.
707280	711280	And it'd be also the same way if they decided, Hey, we're going to go digital only.
711280	714460	Now granted with that, they could, you know, sell the little cards that they're doing now
714460	716660	and that's fine.
716660	721300	But I mean, there's no, there's not a lot of money to be made in new games.
721300	726640	It's all used sales is where they're making their money and yeah, they could probably,
726640	731880	you know, for some sort of kickbacks from, you know, these, um, hardware manufacturers,
731880	733280	but it's not going to happen.
733280	736040	It's just not, no one's going to buy into that.
736040	737640	They're going to be like, fuck that bullshit.
737640	740240	I'm going to buy a PlayStation or a Wii U.
740240	744400	We definitely see game companies are already trying to kind of cut at the knees a little
744400	745600	bit of the used game market.
745600	750200	We see the online passes, but I see a big push towards digital distribution.
750200	754360	Like isn't the VEDA supposed to have the games are cheaper now to download than they are.
754360	756000	But they haven't released any of those yet.
756000	757000	So we don't know.
757000	763280	I mean, Japan, I mean it may be a little bit cheaper, but even still though, it's just
763280	768520	that stuff is kind of to entice you to buy new, not forcing you to buy new.
768520	774000	And I mean, they're not going to do anything like that anyways to tie it to one system
774000	779880	because come on, what company had a huge failure rate with their launch systems?
779880	781280	Who's really going to risk that bullshit?
781280	785120	Oh, I bought 20 games, but now they're all fucking useless because my system died.
785120	786120	I don't think so.
786120	787980	They're not going to do that.
787980	790560	It would be so ridiculous to even try to do that.
790560	797640	And let's just say that, I mean, that would be easy to break for hackers to break, oh,
797640	798840	let's make it burn stuff.
798840	801400	Oh, we'll just break the burner out of it.
801400	802400	It's not going to happen.
802400	806320	And fuck, they're not going to make a console with a goddamn burner that can actually read
806320	807320	those disks.
807320	809040	That's just like piracy right there.
809040	812080	Like, oh, no, one's going to hack that to burn games.
812080	813760	Oh no, not at all.
813760	814760	Of course.
814760	818640	Now, granted, I think that was only one theory about how it's all supposed to work.
818640	823240	I mean, that theory is so like vague and just like, well, here's how I think.
823240	824240	It doesn't make any sense.
824240	826020	They're just making assumptions.
826020	827720	There's no data to support that.
827720	828720	Yes.
828720	832180	Will they continue on this trend where they're going to have, you know, some sort of code
832180	835520	that you put in to give you some extra something or other?
835520	836520	Yeah, maybe.
836520	840040	Are they going to maybe do something where it's going to tie it to your console as far
840040	842600	as like your game saves or something?
842600	843600	Maybe.
843600	844600	I don't know.
844600	847600	But I think Microsoft's a little bit more lax with that at least.
847600	852360	You're tying them to at least your profile, but even that you can get around.
852360	857460	I just don't think anyone's going to do anything that ballsy right now as far as making it
857460	859800	where the used games will just not play in the system.
859800	864660	Because I'm telling you, if one does that and the other ones don't, that's a big disadvantage
864660	865660	for them.
865660	871280	Because GameStop will just say, fuck you guys, I'm not going to support your system as much.
871280	876200	Well, you know what, Microsoft's in an interesting situation as well with the whole online pass
876200	881320	is that I don't think Microsoft can still justify the online pass for their first party
881320	882320	games.
882320	885440	And if they do it, there's going to be a lot of crap that they're going to start getting.
885440	887920	Because notice they're the one company that kind of hasn't been able to do it yet because
887920	890740	they're charging for Xbox Live.
890740	894360	So I mean, literally they're going to start double dipping for online passes.
894360	898060	See here's the thing though, theirs is a little bit different.
898060	900740	It's the same, it's same but different I guess.
900740	907160	They have content that comes with the launch, I guess the launch pressing or whatever, the
907160	908820	first pressing of a game.
908820	911020	They have extra content that comes with it.
911020	917360	Now the thing is, so is they're not fucking putting out there saying, hey, this is our
917360	919040	online pass.
919040	920600	It's just, it's download content.
920600	924480	Like for example, I think with Alan Wake you got an episode or something for, it's like
924480	926600	the first piece of download content for free.
926600	931600	And that's cool that they're putting something in there for you to entice you to buy new.
931600	937440	And that's all they have to do to spin it with EA instead of saying, this is an online
937440	938440	pass.
938440	939440	They say, hey, guess what?
939440	944160	The launch, the first launch pressing of this game is going to get some extra download content
944160	945160	with it.
945160	947840	Oh my God, you don't even have to fucking call it an online pass.
947840	949560	Why did you call it an online pass?
949560	953720	There's such a negative connotation with that and you're just going to go and cut yourself
953720	957880	at the niche just because this is what you've done with the other games?
957880	962200	Just say, hey, look, it's a bonus DLC that we're putting out for those people that buy
962200	963200	new.
963200	965680	If you buy it used, you can still enjoy the wonderful game, but you're going to have to
965680	966680	buy the DLC.
966680	971160	I mean, that's not, that's not that bad and people can kind of expect that.
971160	975920	Why should I get fucking free DLC if I didn't buy the game new?
975920	981080	It's just how they're free, they really were dumb how they phrase it.
981080	985040	Going to our chat, I'm a chat that orange on a trader.com Amiga 777 says, unless the
985040	988300	next Xbox is download only, then that could be a problem.
988300	989680	It's not going to fucking happen.
989680	991800	Well, let me, let me say something for a minute.
991800	998040	You can't be download only because we all have those caps on the, like the Comcast service
998040	1000160	and stuff is still 250 gig cap.
1000160	1001400	One Xbox 360 game.
1001400	1003580	If it's a big one, I mean, some of them don't really fill up the disc.
1003580	1005400	They're like maybe 900 megs.
1005400	1009560	Some of them though, like, you know, are probably what a good four or five gigabytes Blu-rays
1009560	1011520	especially on average six gigs.
1011520	1012520	Yeah.
1012520	1016240	So I mean, you can only download so many of those and if you're streaming more movies,
1016240	1019580	something's going to give everybody wants a piece of this.
1019580	1024680	Now Xbox wants to charge me to, you know, download the game cause I can't buy it used
1024680	1025680	anymore.
1025680	1029000	But yet Comcast wants to charge me for using the bandwidth to download the game.
1029000	1031760	I mean the consumers are going to reject this at some point.
1031760	1032860	They're going to say it's not worth it.
1032860	1035840	Go back to playing the old system.
1035840	1042220	Some people will buy digital downloads and they have that out there right now.
1042220	1045800	There's nothing wrong with offering things in multiple ways.
1045800	1048600	Whether you want to buy a new disc, you want to buy a used disc, you want to buy a digital
1048600	1052860	copy, you want to rent, whatever.
1052860	1055800	There's nothing wrong with that.
1055800	1056800	Giving people options.
1056800	1060920	But when you start forcing people to download only, then people aren't going to buy your
1060920	1061920	system.
1061920	1062920	Hello?
1062920	1063920	PSP Go.
1063920	1064920	Yeah, I know.
1064920	1067280	I think the PSP Go is a great example of that.
1067280	1072920	I know people that own a PSP Go that actually really like the system from a hardware perspective
1072920	1073920	and all of that.
1073920	1077280	So it really sounds like what happened with the PSP Go was kind of a tragedy because their
1077280	1081880	whole implementing the digital download thing kind of got rejected by the user base as a
1081880	1088080	whole and only, you know, definitely people that were more into like hardware and, you
1088080	1091920	know, the game, gamophobes or whatever you want to call them, gamophiles, weren't really
1091920	1092920	into the system.
1092920	1094480	Otherwise, it was really rejected by people.
1094480	1102080	And I think if the game makers kind of go down that path of making these systems that
1102080	1107560	are going to be really complicated and expensive for the end user, I think they are going to
1107560	1112960	make a hideous mistake that most people, probably not the type of people who listen to this
1112960	1115760	show, although I would say a good portion that, you know, listen to show or are gaming
1115760	1119960	enthusiasts and do podcasts, but most people, as in the people that carry the Nintendo Wii
1119960	1125760	to number one, are not going to feel like they need a new console.
1125760	1128760	They're not going to feel like they need to upgrade to this console because it sounds
1128760	1129760	like, like what?
1129760	1131200	You're going to charge me all this?
1131200	1132760	This sounds like a Divix machine.
1132760	1133760	Okay.
1133760	1136760	First off, most of those people are going to know what a Divix machine is.
1136760	1138160	You know what I mean, right?
1138160	1140800	Second, the people aren't going to be comfortable.
1140800	1146360	You know, your average consumer, sadly, is not comfortable with understanding how digital
1146360	1147880	downloads work and stuff.
1147880	1150760	They don't understand how that is.
1150760	1154800	And that's why they like WiiWare's taken off really for Nintendo as far as like, I think
1154800	1161040	more of the hardcore crowd because no one's, I mean, if they offered it in a way they presented
1161040	1164720	it like Wii Sports Resort had DLC or something like that, well, of course, you know, none
1164720	1167000	of the Nintendo games had DLC.
1167000	1171360	If they had DLC for like Wii Sports Resort, maybe they would have sold some stuff.
1171360	1174520	But I think most people aren't comfortable with that.
1174520	1178580	I mean, hell, with those wireless systems, I'd be willing to bet most people didn't know
1178580	1185280	how to hook it up to their internet, let alone be able to have the equipment to hook it up
1185280	1186280	to their internet.
1186280	1190080	Because a lot of people don't have wifi in their house.
1190080	1195520	Bochi Kawa in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, I saw a PSP go for sale at Kmart last
1195520	1198200	week and I said, huh, didn't know they still made those.
1198200	1200560	Oh, wait, those are probably just never taken off the shelf.
1200560	1203680	Dude, you're at Kmart.
1203680	1206380	I was at Kmart.
1206380	1207380	What did you find?
1207380	1208380	Dust bunnies?
1208380	1209760	No, I bought cat litter there.
1209760	1210760	Okay.
1210760	1211760	Because cat litter doesn't go bad.
1211760	1213080	It doesn't matter if it's five years old.
1213080	1217040	Do they still have the doors that have the pressure sensors that you step on to open
1217040	1218040	them up?
1218040	1221400	That's always fascinating.
1221400	1225920	Really I couldn't tell because they were very squishy anyway.
1225920	1227480	Do they still have the icy machines?
1227480	1229280	No, it didn't have an icy machine.
1229280	1231520	Everybody has icy machines now.
1231520	1232520	This is what I remember.
1232520	1236780	I did however go to the opening of a 7-Eleven and they gave up free Slurpees.
1236780	1237780	Good times.
1237780	1241320	All right, going to the chat room from other comments on Loki's rants and this whole story.
1241320	1244800	Spazinator PC says, download only is risky.
1244800	1248560	Look at what I went through with Sony and my videos kind of referencing how he's, you
1248560	1252480	know, his PlayStations will break or he'll lose the license to his videos and he's had
1252480	1253480	this huge collection.
1253480	1255200	It's just a big pain in the butt.
1255200	1258180	Uni in our chat room says, I rather want a physical copy of the game.
1258180	1260040	It's all about the gratification.
1260040	1261160	And I agree with that too.
1261160	1266440	There is, you know, what happens to game collectors if things go digital only?
1266440	1270780	Like Dark Soccer, I imagine that's got to piss you off to no end because you're so,
1270780	1274360	you and Dan are so into like collecting that if everything goes digital, it's like, great.
1274360	1276160	What do I have to show for it?
1276160	1277160	Bits and bytes.
1277160	1278160	Great.
1278160	1279160	Good job.
1279160	1289440	Because that there goes, you know, the need for your manuals for production material is
1289440	1290440	pissing me off.
1290440	1294440	Well, let me put it this way, a lot of this stuff I think already is digital as far as
1294440	1300020	like, you know, Xbox Live Arcade, Xbox Indie Games, PlayStation Network, all that stuff.
1300020	1302240	There's a lot of digital content out there already.
1302240	1305040	I think if you're going to see anything in the new consoles, it's probably going to be
1305040	1310140	some sort of actual cloud streaming as well where you may have the option to stream your
1310140	1311140	game or whatever.
1311140	1316000	Instead of a demo, you get a time, you know, demo of the actual full game and get to play
1316000	1317000	that.
1317000	1319320	You mean what they're doing now on PlayStation Plus?
1319320	1320320	Sort of.
1320320	1326360	Or you can actually, you know, have games on demand almost like where you actually rent
1326360	1329360	them and play them that way.
1329360	1335920	Because that way the publisher still gets a, you know, kick out of that or kick back
1335920	1340400	and you know, it's all trackable and it's win-win.
1340400	1344560	Gamers get to try a game and the publishers get paid.
1344560	1348640	All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks or we'll be here all night.
1348640	1351400	So we're going to go around and talk about what video games we have been playing this
1351400	1354120	week and our impressions thereof.
1354120	1355640	Dark Sakura, ladies first.
1355640	1357320	Stupid computer just froze again.
1357320	1358320	No.
1358320	1363040	It does this thing where the cursor will freeze and it's seriously pissing me off.
1363040	1364040	Okay.
1364040	1369320	Um, I played, I actually got Bubble Bobble for iPhone, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble.
1369320	1370320	Best move.
1370320	1375200	I've been playing the crap out of it because if there's a puzzle game that I think I love
1375200	1378800	almost as much as P.O.P.O., it's Puzzle Bobble.
1378800	1380000	How does that work with the iOS Touch?
1380000	1383040	Do you just kind of touch on the grid where you want the bubble to fly or do you still
1383040	1384040	have to kind of drag?
1384040	1385040	You drag your finger across.
1385040	1386040	Okay.
1386040	1391600	It kind of sucks though if you've accidentally tapped it and then, oh shoot, I sent the bubble
1391600	1392600	out.
1392600	1393600	But so far it's not like super hard.
1393600	1401520	I've gotten like a gold star on every level but one and I've beaten the first two areas.
1401520	1407880	So um, I've played that, I've played WoW.
1407880	1411760	I really haven't done a lot of playing of much of anything else though just because
1411760	1413160	I've been hurting.
1413160	1418520	So I was going to start Skyrim but I'd really rather play it on PC.
1418520	1421000	You should go check out how Alan's modded his all out.
1421000	1423080	He's made the inventory screens like usable.
1423080	1424080	It's pretty awesome.
1424080	1425080	Cool.
1425080	1426360	That's one of the nice things about having it on PC I think.
1426360	1430200	But I'm still loyal to my P.A.S. 3 because I like to sit my big butt on the couch and
1430200	1431200	have my controller.
1431200	1434040	And Dan's lusting out for the new Borderlands.
1434040	1435040	Oh yeah, yeah.
1435040	1436040	Yeah.
1436040	1437040	Soon.
1437040	1438040	Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?
1438040	1441480	Um, well since it's been a few weeks, I've played quite a bit actually.
1441480	1446560	Of course, you know, there's new DLC for Saints Row the Third.
1446560	1453720	I mean, I kind of knew what it was going to be getting in, you know, just looking at it.
1453720	1458040	Basically the new Saints Row the Third DLC is Game Evil 7.
1458040	1463720	It's a bunch of side missions or activities if you will that you get to play on it.
1463720	1468160	And most of them are just kind of redressed activities from the regular game.
1468160	1473400	Like they have an escort mission where it's you're escorting Genki and then you run people
1473400	1478360	over with your car and that charges up a flamethrower that you torch people with.
1478360	1479360	It's very boring.
1479360	1481720	But, you know, and I've finished those.
1481720	1490480	And then of course there's also the one that's the sad panda one.
1490480	1491480	I can't remember.
1491480	1495480	It's some kitten thing where you're rolling around a giant ball and it looks like, oh,
1495480	1496480	Katamari.
1496480	1498560	No, it's actually, it handles like a car.
1498560	1501200	It even has like the sounds of a car.
1501200	1502400	It's basically a car.
1502400	1505640	So you're running stuff over and it's just a mayhem mission like they have in the regular
1505640	1507840	game.
1507840	1509640	So that was neat, I guess.
1509640	1518160	And then of course there was another one that was basically just the regular Professor Genki,
1518160	1521820	just his normal running through a maze and killing mascots and stuff.
1521820	1525640	And then the one that was actually really weird that I thought was the most enjoyable
1525640	1529840	out of all of them, because it is actually unique, was where you're skydiving as a panda
1529840	1535280	through rings, landing on roofs and then chainsawing mascots and then skydiving down some more,
1535280	1537080	bouncing off of balloons and stuff like that.
1537080	1538400	It's really ridiculous.
1538400	1542600	But that was kind of fun because it was somewhat unique.
1542600	1548600	The only thing that's terrible about this is I finished the whole DLC portion in about
1548600	1550920	45 minutes.
1550920	1552480	Maybe less than 45 minutes.
1552480	1554100	I didn't get all the achievements.
1554100	1556520	I got about 80% of them.
1556520	1557960	But that's sad.
1557960	1560960	$7 for 45 minutes of entertainment.
1560960	1566200	I mean, really they could have added a lot more content to it, but they only put two
1566200	1569480	different levels of each activity that they added.
1569480	1574680	I mean, they could have added a ton more activities or at least more versions of it that are difficult,
1574680	1575880	more increasingly difficult.
1575880	1582800	But no, they took the easy way out and just pretty much put out the, I don't know, the
1582800	1588620	most minimal version of DLC as possible, which is very disappointing.
1588620	1593400	So I'm kind of hesitant on whether I'm going to be buying some more of the other DLC that's
1593400	1594520	going to be coming out.
1594520	1597520	Probably because I do like Saints Row the Third and actually did go back and play some
1597520	1604500	of the car theft missions that I had problems with it glitching out.
1604500	1609200	And so I got some of those done, which is cool because I'm trying to get all the achievements
1609200	1610920	for that.
1610920	1612400	And then what else?
1612400	1617680	Oh, I played, I downloaded some indie games, I actually played one of them, which is DLC
1617680	1618680	Quest.
1618680	1621240	Oh yeah, I remember that one.
1621240	1626080	DLC Quest, it's kind of funny, it's more of like, it's something that would be a free
1626080	1627080	Flash game.
1627080	1632720	I mean, it's a cute little concept, but the game's over in less than an hour, but it's
1632720	1635460	a buck, so it's not that bad.
1635460	1639360	Better than paying $7 for 45 minutes.
1639360	1643000	So it was alright, I mean, I'd recommend if you want to check it out, but that's kind
1643000	1647840	of the problem with indie games, there's a lot of cool concepts on there, but when you
1647840	1650080	go and play them, they're really short.
1650080	1655600	It's kind of disappointing that it's not a full-fledged game.
1655600	1658440	And then, let's see, what else did I play?
1658440	1660000	Oh, of course, tons of Skyrim.
1660000	1667400	I'm already, god, I don't even know, probably 120 hours into the game already.
1667400	1676160	Level 54, although once I glitch out the Ogma and Finium, that'll be level 81 soon enough.
1676160	1680480	And let's see, what else, did I do anything fun in Skyrim?
1680480	1685240	I don't know, the game's getting more glitchy, as I mentioned before, I'm having texture
1685240	1689960	problems now where it's not drawing the proper textures on things, and all sorts of weird
1689960	1690960	stuff happening.
1690960	1693300	But there's a new patch coming in really soon for Skyrim, right?
1693300	1694920	I don't think it's gonna fix it.
1694920	1698800	Every patch makes things worse, okay, I'm telling you.
1698800	1703680	So we'll see, at least that patch, though, at the very least, that is gonna fix the Blood
1703680	1708200	on Ice mission, the one that's all fucked up for me right now.
1708200	1710400	So I'm glad that's gonna be fixed soon.
1710400	1715600	And then, of course, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, I'm playing lots of that, and kicking
1715600	1716600	ass.
1716600	1717600	Nice.
1717600	1720720	Alright, quickly, my gaming week, because there really hasn't been a whole lot I've
1720720	1723880	been playing this week outside of WoW, there's not a lot of World of Warcraft this week.
1723880	1726640	Okay, you know what, that's what I've been into.
1726640	1730720	There's not a lot of old games I've really gone back to visit, although we did manage
1730720	1735980	to get a copy of Toy Story Midway Mania on the Wii, because, you know, I love Disneyland,
1735980	1739780	I love the rides and all that stuff, so Midway Mania's one of my favorite rides.
1739780	1743040	So I was like, what the heck, let's just, you know, let's just check this out and see
1743040	1744040	what it's like.
1744040	1749420	And it's, okay, yeah, they try to emulate the ride by, basically you point the Wii mode
1749420	1754640	at the screen, you hit A, and try to hit the targets, but, as you can imagine, it's pretty
1754640	1755640	basic.
1755640	1757240	Did you play it in 3D?
1757240	1760880	No, I heard you could, but- It's supposed to come with glasses.
1760880	1767600	No, I had a used one, so maybe they didn't have it, yeah, so, so, I don't know.
1767600	1770200	I guess I'll have to, what are they, are they the red-blue, or are they the polarized ones?
1770200	1772480	I don't know, I think it's red-blue.
1772480	1776680	I wonder if it's kind of like the ride, which uses the polarized ones, I don't know.
1776680	1777680	No, it's not that fancy.
1777680	1780040	Maybe if I steal a copy from the ride, maybe it'll work at home?
1780040	1784200	No, they don't have, you don't have a TV that supports polarized glasses.
1784200	1786320	It's just, it's either red-blue or the cyan-purple, so.
1786320	1787320	Yeah, I'm sure.
1787320	1788720	Or a cyan-green.
1788720	1793920	It's probably, you know, it's not gonna really change my opinion on the game.
1793920	1798080	They've tried to do some cute stuff with, like, you know, collecting stickers, and,
1798080	1803480	you know, all the levels are not quite the same that they are in the ride itself.
1803480	1807200	You feel a lot of influence from achievements and that whole thing.
1807200	1809640	You know, you gotta score so many points on a stage.
1809640	1813300	But everything's relatively easy, but you have to remember, it is, it's a Disney game.
1813300	1814940	It's more geared towards kids.
1814940	1819120	I bet it would be kind of fun to bring out at a party, especially with my friends that
1819120	1820120	love Disneyland.
1820120	1823880	Like, let's say Dark Sakura, myself, and maybe a couple of our other Disney-loving friends
1823880	1825420	got together and did some drinking.
1825420	1827680	This game might be fun.
1827680	1829240	Anything's fun with drinking.
1829240	1830240	Exactly!
1830240	1831240	Otherwise...
1831240	1832560	No, a game would be fun with drinking.
1832560	1833560	What?
1833560	1835280	Is the Kinect Disneyland adventures, I think, would be fun.
1835280	1836800	I totally want that game still.
1836800	1837960	I've heard it's pretty good.
1837960	1840080	I don't have it myself, but I have some friends that have it.
1840080	1841520	It's surprisingly not as bad as you'd think.
1841520	1846440	There's also that other one, though, they're doing, was it the Pixar, was it, uh, Kinect
1846440	1849080	Rush, Disney Pixar adventure?
1849080	1850360	I hadn't heard of that, no.
1850360	1851360	It's coming out in March.
1851360	1852360	Oh.
1852360	1855000	I wonder if that, is that similar to the Disneyland adventures?
1855000	1856000	Because it's just...
1856000	1857000	Sort of.
1857000	1858000	California adventures, maybe?
1858000	1859000	I don't know.
1859000	1860000	No, it's all Pixar movies.
1860000	1861000	No.
1861000	1864880	But they have, like, the Incredibles and stuff in there, and Ratatouille, and...
1864880	1865880	Yeah.
1865880	1869000	And you wanna see Wall-E's in there, too, which is kinda cool.
1869000	1870000	Very cool.
1870000	1872760	Alright, well, but, otherwise, that's really the only new game I've been playing this week.
1872760	1877200	Keep in mind, next week, I have Coming to My House Tuesday, Final Fantasy XIII-2, and
1877200	1878200	Soulcalibur V.
1878200	1880240	So, it's gonna be a busy week next week.
1880240	1883960	I haven't finished XIII, so, you know what, I'm holding off on it, and...
1883960	1887760	Just, I, you know what, I never completely finished it either, but I'm not gonna, I,
1887760	1891400	I, I'm worried that's gonna stop a lot of people from playing it, but, you know what,
1891400	1893120	there's, just go watch the spoiler video online.
1893120	1896160	I already know what the spoiler is, but I still wanna finish the game.
1896160	1897160	Yeah.
1897160	1901720	Well, Soulcalibur V is coming out this week, and, um, believe it or not, we know somebody
1901720	1906480	who's been able to get their hands on it already, and we're gonna call him right now, and he's
1906480	1910960	gonna come on and talk to us a little bit about Soulcalibur V!
1910960	1916080	And it's my buddy from the one and only, Hoard House!
1916080	1918040	Xtaphir should hopefully be on the line.
1918040	1919040	Hello!
1919040	1920040	Hello!
1920040	1922040	Is this Xtaphir?
1922040	1923040	This is Xtaphir.
1923040	1924040	Hey, Xtaphir!
1924040	1925040	How are you?
1925040	1926040	Good!
1926040	1928800	I'm so glad we finally have an excuse to get you on Orange Lawn's radio, cause usually
1928800	1931320	it's, it's only ever Hoard House.
1931320	1932520	I know!
1932520	1937560	But you have been able to play Soulcalibur V, right?
1937560	1938560	This is true.
1938560	1942560	Alright, now, I don't know how you did that, but I'm not gonna ask questions, but, okay,
1942560	1948440	so you had to play Soulcalibur V, so, first off, now, I think our listeners have to remember,
1948440	1951160	you, you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?
1951160	1954920	You play a lot of WoW, but you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?
1954920	1957080	Um, not, not usually.
1957080	1965560	I, I got a PS3 last year, and I, um, you know, I, I played through Uncharted 2, and I have
1965560	1970600	a few fighting games, like, well, a couple fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street
1970600	1977560	Fighter IV, so, uh, you know, I, I've been, I've been getting, uh, you know, down with
1977560	1979280	console games lately, you know?
1979280	1980280	You getting jiggy with it?
1980280	1981760	And jiggy with the consoles?
1981760	1982760	Yeah.
1982760	1984640	I, I guess.
1984640	1987320	Have you ever played a Soulcalibur game in your life?
1987320	1988320	Yes.
1988320	1989320	Okay.
1989320	1995400	I played, I, well, I actually played the original Soul Blade, which I guess was Soul Edge in
1995400	2003720	Japan, and, uh, and so I, I do, I did, uh, play that when it came out on the PlayStation,
2003720	2010520	um, you know, years and years and years ago, and then, um, I played Soulcalibur 2 when
2010520	2016200	I actually lived with you, um, because I remember you got the Weaver, or it was the GameCube
2016200	2022200	version with Link in it, and so I do remember playing that, but that was the last time I
2022200	2028800	ever played Soulcalibur, any kind of Soulcalibur game was, uh, you know, your copy of Soulcalibur
2028800	2029800	2.
2029800	2031600	Well, you know what you're saying isn't different from a lot of people.
2031600	2036560	A lot of people missed Soulcalibur 3 because it was kind of late in the PlayStation 2 lifespan,
2036560	2040880	and if I remember right, it was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so it never came out to the other
2040880	2041880	consoles.
2041880	2045760	Then Soulcalibur 4, some people saw Darth Vader and Yoda on the box and were like, no
2045760	2046760	thank you.
2046760	2050480	Although, I think, I think Soulcalibur 4 wasn't bad.
2050480	2054960	I like all the Soulcalibur games, but, alright, so here we are, Soulcalibur 5, so tell us
2054960	2056920	a little bit about the game.
2056920	2068880	Yeah, I was lucky enough to get a collector's edition, and I was, you know, didn't really
2068880	2076200	know what to expect, so I started playing with the story mode, which, I don't know what
2076200	2080960	it is about fighting games and story modes, but they're all lame.
2080960	2085160	They all, like, I think that the story mode is kind of cheap.
2085160	2093080	All of the cutscenes are like little, you know, comic book pictures, and you just see
2093080	2099400	little, you see little blurbs of what's going on, you know, and they do have voice acting
2099400	2100900	accompanying it.
2100900	2104120	But who plays fighting games for the stories?
2104120	2105120	Who plays fighting games for the stories?
2105120	2109160	And I'm going to get emails from angry fighting game fans.
2109160	2110160	I do.
2110160	2115200	But then again, Street Fighter 4 had a really cool story mode and had that little anime
2115200	2117200	thing that went along with it, too.
2117200	2120320	So it was actually really immersive, and I've always liked the Street Fighter stories.
2120320	2123480	But Soulcalibur 5 gave you comic book and bad acting.
2123480	2131240	Yeah, well, it wasn't that it was bad acting, it was just, it just felt kind of cheap.
2131240	2136200	But they do have cutscenes, it's just the, well, animated cutscenes, they're kind of
2136200	2141000	few and, you know, you blink and you miss them.
2141000	2146620	But in terms of the fighting portion of the game, I love it.
2146620	2150560	I think it's really cool.
2150560	2155840	And the thing is, you know, of course, I'm used to Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2,
2155840	2159000	you know, or Street Fighter 4.
2159000	2164700	And so I was half thinking when I hit up, I'm going to jump.
2164700	2169520	And so when I didn't, I'm like, Oh, God, like, this is 3D, right?
2169520	2171440	Like I'm not I'm not used to that.
2171440	2174400	I'm more used to the 2D fighting style.
2174400	2178120	So it was kind of disorienting for me.
2178120	2179680	But that's just a personal thing.
2179680	2185640	But I really think the graphics and the way the fighting works and everything I kind of
2185640	2186640	you kind of ease into it.
2186640	2190880	And I think that Soulcalibur is kind of user friendly.
2190880	2192320	When it comes to fighting.
2192320	2199000	I think it's a really good game to be introduced to if you haven't ever done any 3D fighting
2199000	2200640	games before.
2200640	2205920	And I said, like, a tutorial or something was that was there a tutorial or something?
2205920	2213160	No, there's no well, there is a training mode and they kind of hold your hand through combos
2213160	2214520	and all that stuff.
2214520	2220200	But it's just in terms of, I don't know, it just felt like really intuitive, like, you
2220200	2229240	know, there's not much to every move that you you make feels like a special move because
2229240	2234280	it all has flashy graphics and everything is just kind of it's aesthetically pleasing,
2234280	2236240	I guess is what I'm trying to get at.
2236240	2240200	Now I know I know you had a minute to play around with the create your own character
2240200	2244040	mode, which has been a popular part of Soulcalibur since the third one.
2244040	2246320	What did you think of create a character?
2246320	2248680	Oh, I love it.
2248680	2251080	I think it's, I think it's really good.
2251080	2255440	I mean, they have a ton of options that you can do.
2255440	2261280	I made a black chick chick and I named her Rob after you because you're a black chick.
2261280	2262280	Thank you.
2262280	2263280	Thank you.
2263280	2264280	Yeah.
2264280	2265280	I appreciate it.
2265280	2266280	Yeah.
2266280	2268760	And you can you can make her her special moves.
2268760	2275480	Have like a little, you know, aura and you are, you know, and make that excuse me make
2275480	2279760	that aura a color and I made it purple.
2279760	2280760	Like Tinky Winky.
2280760	2281760	I appreciate that.
2281760	2282760	Oh, no problem.
2282760	2283760	Whatever.
2283760	2285280	I don't get that.
2285280	2288800	But um, yeah, it's it's really cool.
2288800	2294560	And then then I brought it over to my brother in laws and he was able to make a character
2294560	2302240	that looks a lot like Cole from what's an infamous and and my sister made a character
2302240	2304840	that I can't quite describe.
2304840	2314840	She looks like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica, but with like, a monk's outfit on and like
2314840	2319640	some kind of like really heavy looking.
2319640	2322000	She has like heavy looking gauntlets on or something.
2322000	2323040	It's like really weird.
2323040	2326800	So that's something that a lot of people in Soul Calibur will do is they try to like copy
2326800	2330400	characters from you know, popular culture and stuff best they can and they create a
2330400	2331580	character mode.
2331580	2334000	So yeah, and then fuck them up.
2334000	2335000	Yeah, exactly.
2335000	2338680	Because you can't ever get it perfect in Soul Calibur.
2338680	2342140	So did you did you get to do any verses like were you playing against other people and
2342140	2343140	you know,
2343140	2348160	no, because the game isn't isn't really out yet.
2348160	2353960	I tried to go online, but it said nobody's playing the game or whatever it like didn't
2353960	2356240	let me connect to anybody.
2356240	2361040	So I didn't really get to experience the online element to the game.
2361040	2365480	But I'm sure that it has a nice user interface.
2365480	2367520	So there's that.
2367520	2368520	Okay.
2368520	2371080	It has a nice interface.
2371080	2372480	I appreciate that.
2372480	2373480	Yeah.
2373480	2374480	All right.
2374480	2378120	So anything else that the OLR listeners should know about Soul Calibur five before it comes
2378120	2381560	out this week?
2381560	2384000	I think that it's it's a good game.
2384000	2388560	I mean, if you like fighting games, and you like 3d fighting games in particular, like
2388560	2390280	I don't think you'll be disappointed.
2390280	2395840	I think that from what I hear, I read a few reviews on it.
2395840	2402160	And they seem to think that it's improved from since Soul Calibur four, I guess there
2402160	2407200	were some little buggy issues that they say that it's improved on.
2407200	2415220	But they also kind of echo my my opinion that the story the single player story mode is
2415220	2418880	kind of, you know, kind of cheap, but whatever, you know, it's a fighting game.
2418880	2422280	You don't you don't play for the story, but no, you just want to wrestle.
2422280	2426480	That's why we play fighting games, you know, sometimes you just want to wrestle.
2426480	2427480	Exactly.
2427480	2428480	You know.
2428480	2429480	All right.
2429480	2430480	Well, extra for I gotta let you go.
2430480	2431480	So we get to some gaming news.
2431480	2434320	But thank you for coming on and talking about Soul Calibur five.
2434320	2437460	What would you give it on a scale of one to 10?
2437460	2440920	I would give it Can I do point five?
2440920	2441920	Sure.
2441920	2442920	I'll do do 8.5.
2442920	2443920	How about that?
2443920	2444920	Good.
2444920	2445920	Good.
2445920	2447760	Because we have to always have that arbitrary score for no particular reason.
2447760	2448760	Yeah.
2448760	2453680	So before we let you go, is there anything you want to plug?
2453680	2454680	Somebody's but
2454680	2459280	well, we hope this show will help you in accomplishing that.
2459280	2460680	Oh, okay.
2460680	2461680	I'm sure this show will.
2461680	2462680	All right.
2462680	2463680	Me that.
2463680	2464680	All right.
2464680	2465680	Bye extrovert.
2465680	2466680	Okay.
2466680	2467680	Bye.
2467680	2468680	All right.
2468680	2474520	The one and only expert from Hoard House www.hoardhouse.com World of Warcraft discussion,
2474520	2475520	and so forth.
2475520	2476520	All right.
2476520	2477680	Let's get into some actual gaming news now.
2477680	2478880	Oh, housekeeping real quick.
2478880	2483120	Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio or our Twitter, twitter.com slash
2483120	2484120	OLR.
2484120	2488800	As far as our upcoming schedule of shows, we are scheduled to be here every week.
2488800	2490080	Yes, we will be here next week.
2490080	2494840	I know it's Super Bowl Sunday, but whatever.
2494840	2497360	So our local team isn't even in it anyway.
2497360	2498360	So whatever.
2498360	2503680	Uh, and, uh, yeah, so we'll be here and throughout, I don't see any weeks off coming up.
2503680	2506680	Do you have any, do you have any more cheesecake dates, star soccer that I need to be aware
2506680	2507680	of?
2507680	2508680	Huh?
2508680	2509680	All right.
2509680	2511600	Excuse me.
2511600	2516160	Let's get into some, uh, gaming news then Loki.
2516160	2517160	All right.
2517160	2526920	Uh, let's start off with talking about some ridiculous rumors regarding the Xbox lube.
2526920	2535640	And um, of course the rumor is that apparently the new system will launch on holiday 2013
2535640	2543080	and it's going to launch with a new GPU that's going to be put out by, um, ATI or AMD I guess
2543080	2544440	at this point.
2544440	2554460	It's um, I guess part of the AMD 6,000 series, um, which is roughly about 20%, uh, more performance
2554460	2559000	power than the Wii U, at least what the Wii U is specced at right now.
2559000	2565960	And also, um, apparently it is, uh, quite a bit stronger than, uh, the Xbox 360 and
2565960	2566960	PlayStation three.
2566960	2572760	Obviously, I mean, why would you put out a system with a graphics card or a graphics
2572760	2579600	chip that's not, I mean, put out the same stuff with more copy protection, two of them
2579600	2580600	together.
2580600	2582600	Call it a weed.
2582600	2583600	No.
2583600	2590200	So yeah, it's going to support DirectX or the Radeon, uh, HD, uh, 66, 70, which is what
2590200	2594920	this chip is going to be sort of based on, uh, supports DirectX 11, which is going to
2594920	2595920	look nice.
2595920	2601080	A 10 ADP HD multi display output, 3d and a bunch of other fun stuff.
2601080	2604680	I mean, and that's what it's assumed as right now, what they're going to be using.
2604680	2609920	I guess they're already manufacturing the chips for it, so we'll see.
2609920	2615760	I mean, it's all rumors, so we'll know until they officially announce it, which they could,
2615760	2617900	they could announce the new systems coming.
2617900	2620280	Do rumors like this really even matter?
2620280	2624440	Because the whole, like the Xbox will be whatever it's called, will be more powerful.
2624440	2625440	Duh.
2625440	2627180	It's all potential.
2627180	2628960	This just basically says potential.
2628960	2631800	I mean, however they use that, it's hard to say.
2631800	2636960	I mean, and even the chips that are in the Xbox 360 right now compared to today's standards
2636960	2639000	are not powerful at all.
2639000	2640760	But it's just how they use it.
2640760	2647400	Um, so it's, it's, I mean, it's hard to say what it will look like.
2647400	2651860	I'm sure it'll look nice, but also I think a lot of it has to do with when you put the
2651860	2655560	specs out there, then your competition can see it and they know how to one up you.
2655560	2658480	So one reason I would think that Microsoft may not want to put it out there this year
2658480	2662300	is that they don't want Sony to know what's going in there because then Sony will just
2662300	2664080	do whatever they have to do to one up it.
2664080	2666360	I could still do that anyways.
2666360	2670440	They put their system out longer, but the thing is it's not like, Oh, well we're going
2670440	2676400	to use the AMD 7,000 instead they have a manufacturer fucking thousands of these chips or millions
2676400	2677400	of these chips.
2677400	2684040	You know, they're not going to just all of a sudden change their mind because IGN's reporting
2684040	2689160	on something that it's a rumor inside source.
2689160	2695440	They're going to put the most powerful GPU CPU that they can in the system and still
2695440	2697300	make it cost effective for the consumer.
2697300	2698300	That's what they're going to do.
2698300	2704920	I mean, I mean, they're not going to, they're going to put an old, uh, the Intel, what's
2704920	2709040	it like seller graphics card 500 or whatever.
2709040	2710040	All right.
2710040	2713120	Moving on to games that are going to be coming out a lot sooner than whatever the next X-Box
2713120	2714120	is.
2714120	2715120	Resident Evil Revelations.
2715120	2717320	There was a couple of news stories going around about it this week.
2717320	2718520	One, the demo is out.
2718520	2722580	I didn't mention it during my gaming week cause I don't like to review demos, but I
2722580	2725680	did download the demo for Resident Evil Revelations.
2725680	2729040	I thought it was interesting because on the 3DS, when you download the demo, or at least
2729040	2734880	this one, it says uses left 30, meaning I would get to play the demo 30 times.
2734880	2735880	And then what?
2735880	2736880	I don't know.
2736880	2737880	Do I have to delete it and download it again?
2737880	2743280	Or, or will my system like know that, Oh, I can't play any, I'm milking this demo for
2743280	2746560	all it's worth having played through it 30 times.
2746560	2748400	Has anyone ever played a demo 30 times?
2748400	2751640	I'm trying to think if I've ever loved a demo that much.
2751640	2752640	I have once.
2752640	2753640	Yes.
2753640	2754640	Really?
2754640	2755640	Okay.
2755640	2756640	What, what?
2756640	2757640	Jumping Flash.
2757640	2758640	Really?
2758640	2764400	I played the demo of Jumping Flash for weeks, several times a day, cause it was so freaking
2764400	2766800	fun and I couldn't afford the game at the time.
2766800	2768200	Alan wants to comment.
2768200	2771520	I played the Bayonetta demo at least two dozen times.
2771520	2772960	The Bayonetta demo was pretty sweet.
2772960	2774200	I'll give it that.
2774200	2775200	Logie?
2775200	2776840	The original Cool Borders demo.
2776840	2779120	I played that tons of times.
2779120	2781480	And the original Saints Row demo.
2781480	2784880	It was a 30 minute demo and I played that over and over and over again.
2784880	2787480	The Final Fantasy, uh, eight demo.
2787480	2791200	I would say maybe the demo for Parappa the Rappa.
2791200	2792200	Yes.
2792200	2794040	I played that a bunch too.
2794040	2795040	That's the only thing.
2795040	2796040	And the Umjammerlami one.
2796040	2797040	Oh.
2797040	2798040	I played that a bunch too.
2798040	2799040	Okay.
2799040	2800040	Okay.
2800040	2802840	Well anyway, look, I don't think Resident Evil Revelations is going to be one of those
2802840	2803840	games.
2803840	2805440	Maybe, I don't know, maybe for you it will be whatever.
2805440	2808080	I played it and I was like, this is kind of neat.
2808080	2810480	I like the 3d effects and it's, it's cool.
2810480	2815240	It's, you know, it's, you know, got that scary Resident Evil S kind of like, like the older
2815240	2819120	games had kind of feels a lot more like that, but I'm going to be honest.
2819120	2820120	What do they want for this game?
2820120	2821120	New?
2821120	2824200	They wanted what, 50 bucks at one point and then they dropped it down to 40, right?
2824200	2825200	Yes.
2825200	2829640	And I don't think I, I don't personally, I'm not into the series enough where I can justify
2829640	2830640	40 bucks.
2830640	2832520	I know there are some people that will, and that's cool.
2832520	2836320	I don't think they're going to be terribly disappointed, but, uh, just, you know, not
2836320	2837920	so much for me.
2837920	2842220	But those that are getting on this game early are going to get something that's a bit of
2842220	2843480	a blessing and a curse.
2843480	2846160	And there's a lot of lulls going around the internet about that this week.
2846160	2847880	I mean, this is on the front page of Yahoo.
2847880	2854040	I saw this is the fact that the Resident Evil Revelations box art is spelled wrong.
2854040	2855880	That was only review copies on the side.
2855880	2859880	It's only, well, they're saying it's the it's well, Capcom put out a statement.
2859880	2863760	Uh, it has come to our attention that there was a misspelling on the Resident Evil Revelations
2863760	2864760	packaging.
2864760	2868480	We apologize for the mistake, which will be corrected for subsequent productions of the
2868480	2869480	game.
2869480	2872000	It makes it sound like the first printing cause it, the first printing has to already
2872000	2873000	be out there.
2873000	2874720	It's, it's hitting shelves on the seventh, right?
2874720	2876360	You're so funny with your print.
2876360	2882320	Remember way back when Okami came out and the, we, and there was an IGN watermark on
2882320	2883320	it.
2883320	2884320	Oh yeah.
2884320	2885320	Oh God.
2885320	2886320	That was funny.
2886320	2890280	They had to like recall them all or something or no, they had the substitute box art and
2890280	2891280	you know what?
2891280	2893520	I didn't even own the game and I got the substitute box art.
2893520	2896180	Well, they're going to do something similar for this.
2896180	2900760	They are saying that they might, uh, actually be, I guess they're going to work on a solution
2900760	2903400	to provide affected customers with the correct packaging.
2903400	2909760	But in my mind, I'm thinking the value of the misspelled ones just shot like way up.
2909760	2914520	Nah, no, you don't think I beg to differ with Logie.
2914520	2920620	Monopoly and I'm thinking like baseball cards that are spelled on or is it in reference
2920620	2921620	to a game?
2921620	2922620	Yeah.
2922620	2923620	Uh huh.
2923620	2928480	There was a release of Monopoly on the Sega master system that had it mono space pulley.
2928480	2930720	But was that in the game or on the box art?
2930720	2933120	On the box art, on the cartridge.
2933120	2934680	Nice.
2934680	2937040	And it's a collector's item.
2937040	2940660	But here's the thing, and this is the only thing I can think of where I do somewhat agree
2940660	2941660	with Logie.
2941660	2944400	Like I agree with you with the classic stuff, but then Logie, I'm thinking that stuff is
2944400	2948480	really easy to fake in this day and age with the types of color printers we have.
2948480	2950280	You know, like how easy would that be?
2950280	2951960	There's ways around it.
2951960	2958840	There are ways to find if it's a fake because, okay, first of all, you'd be dealing with
2958840	2961560	the pound of paper that they use.
2961560	2966040	You would, uh, you would be dealing with their print resolutions.
2966040	2970600	You would be dealing with, you can actually sometimes tell what type of printer was used
2970600	2975640	for something just by looking with, there's a, with a, what's it called?
2975640	2979280	A loop at the, um, the print itself.
2979280	2980280	Yeah.
2980280	2985360	And it says, I hear that eBay is lighting up with high prices for the misspelled ones.
2985360	2987340	Be careful with something like eBay.
2987340	2993280	Just, you know, remember, go back a few episodes, uh, slate or excuse me, Alan got me a birthday
2993280	2998640	present game on eBay that ended up coming from China and it was the wrong damn game.
2998640	3003240	He bought me, he bought me child of Eden and we ended up getting a copy of Assassin's Creed
3003240	3004240	brotherhood.
3004240	3005480	It was a bootleg of the wrong game.
3005480	3006480	It was a bootleg of the wrong game.
3006480	3007480	It was ridiculous.
3007480	3008480	Just be careful with eBay.
3008480	3011800	Not knocking eBay and get a lot of good stuff there, but be very careful with video games.
3011800	3012800	Oh yeah.
3012800	3014520	There are lots of people that will take advantage of you.
3014520	3015520	That reminds me before I forget.
3015520	3019800	I do have master system games to be sending out, um, probably in the next couple of weeks.
3019800	3020800	Awesome.
3020800	3021800	To winners.
3021800	3022800	Good.
3022800	3023800	Good deal.
3023800	3024800	I haven't forgotten about you guys.
3024800	3025800	And, uh, I did have a story here.
3025800	3030320	We already mentioned it though because of the four gigabyte cartridge that resident evil
3030320	3033680	revelations uses as opposed to the two gigabyte cartridge.
3033680	3036800	They were trying to justify a $50 price tag.
3036800	3037800	Well that didn't last.
3037800	3042720	They did officially drop it to $40, but you may think about, well, if you want to play
3042720	3046560	it with a circle pad pro, you're going to have to dump an extra $20 on it anyway.
3046560	3047800	So it's really not that cheap.
3047800	3048800	Well, cool.
3048800	3053240	I saved myself 60 bucks.
3053240	3054840	Which would you download it or something?
3054840	3058400	No, I'm just not going to play it.
3058400	3059400	Okay.
3059400	3060400	Anyhow.
3060400	3063320	All right, let's move on.
3063320	3064320	Tark Sagra.
3064320	3067840	Well, um, I never can pronounce the name of this company, right?
3067840	3069840	Is it ASIS or ASIS or A-S-U-S?
3069840	3070840	ASUS?
3070840	3071840	A-S-U-S.
3071840	3072840	Yeah.
3072840	3073840	Like Loki's laptop.
3073840	3074840	ASUS.
3074840	3075840	ASUS.
3075840	3076840	Um, but...
3076840	3078840	I think most people say A-S-U-S.
3078840	3079840	Yeah.
3079840	3088120	At any rate, um, there is a, uh, note that there is a PC connect SKU, um, going to be
3088120	3091760	coming out for an ASIS, uh, laptop.
3091760	3095520	It's going to apparently have a built-in Kinect sensor.
3095520	3098480	It's, uh, just licensed out by Microsoft.
3098480	3106240	Um, they're not doing the, I guess, the creation of the item itself, but, um, Microsoft did
3106240	3111800	confirm that the laptops are going to have Kinect's functionality built in.
3111800	3116840	And of course, you know, we know the standalone PC Kinect is going to be out, um, on February
3116840	3118600	1st for $249.
3118600	3119600	I'm not surprised.
3119600	3122200	They already, I think they already said that they're going to be trying to integrate that
3122200	3123200	in the PCs.
3123200	3124200	I mean, it makes sense.
3124200	3128120	You're not going to have just a separate Kinect sensor that's going to be separate from the
3128120	3129120	laptop.
3129120	3130120	Of course it's going to be integrated.
3130120	3131120	Makes sense.
3131120	3134640	See, honestly, something like that would be great for me when too much typing, you know,
3134640	3137120	starts to hurt after a while.
3137120	3138120	You know, air type.
3138120	3141240	That would just be pretty awesome.
3141240	3147200	But I mean, I guess for a laptop, I don't know how it would make as much sense as having
3147200	3151520	something like that for a PC because, you know, a lot of people do PC gaming and we
3151520	3155080	have a PC hooked up to our TV in the front room.
3155080	3156080	Something like that would be a good idea.
3156080	3159200	I just don't see exactly how it would work for a laptop unless it's for like virtual
3159200	3162440	keyboard and disabled services.
3162440	3163440	So.
3163440	3165080	All right.
3165080	3173760	Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, this is kind of funny, um, the Wii U getting
3173760	3177400	a brand new, uh, network to go along with it, which is good.
3177400	3183480	I mean, cause right now what they've got for, I don't even know if you really call it and
3183480	3188620	there was a wifi connect or something like that, which I guess that's, that makes sense
3188620	3192240	for like, you know, the Wii and the Nintendo wifi connection.
3192240	3193240	Yes.
3193240	3197660	The Wii and the DS because those are all wifi, but I don't know if the Wii U is wifi.
3197660	3201200	So that wouldn't make much sense if it was a wired connection.
3201200	3205620	But um, the Wii U is getting this brand new thing called the Nintendo network and it's
3205620	3207960	actually going to start with the 3DS.
3207960	3212960	Um, this was kind of leaked out a little bit early with the new Final Fantasy theater was
3212960	3216720	a the rhythm, um, cover actually the logo on there.
3216720	3221820	And then of course, Nintendo, uh, was talking a little bit about it as part of an investor
3221820	3226360	presentation and some of the things that are going to be coming with the Nintendo network
3226360	3229240	communities of Mario Kart seven players.
3229240	3232780	So they're going to have some sort of community feature with that already has communities
3232780	3233780	in it.
3233780	3234780	So are they expanding that?
3234780	3238640	I guess that would be cool if there's like web integration or something like, you know,
3238640	3242400	things that were in halo three like five years ago.
3242400	3246840	Well they're saying, they're saying that community building functionality that, um, they've already
3246840	3248560	implemented in Mario Kart seven.
3248560	3252000	So I don't know if they're still expanding on that, but um, they're also doing an add
3252000	3257280	on content sales and the fact that they don't have DLC yet.
3257280	3258280	Come on.
3258280	3259280	What do you do?
3259280	3260280	Rockband has DLC.
3260280	3261280	Yeah.
3261280	3265120	For the Wii, but not like on the three D S and the DS and stuff like that.
3265120	3266120	All right.
3266120	3267120	Whatever.
3267120	3268120	All right.
3268120	3269120	Okay.
3269120	3271800	Um, preparing for digital distribution of package software.
3271800	3275920	So I mean, they're going to have some, you know, downloadable games, I guess.
3275920	3280520	And the introduction of personal accounts for the Wii U, which in my opinion is the
3280520	3282640	only actual new news in here.
3282640	3283640	Yeah.
3283640	3284640	Yeah.
3284640	3287660	I mean, because yes, I understand that now Nintendo is saying they could sell full games
3287660	3290800	online or whatever, but virtual console is full games.
3290800	3296760	The three DS shots, bigger, full games are fantastic that you can sell full games online.
3296760	3299920	Welcome to 10 years ago for everybody else.
3299920	3304000	I mean, it's like, come on, where the fuck have you been Nintendo?
3304000	3308560	But yay for them finally catching up because I would like to see a Nintendo console that
3308560	3310400	understands online.
3310400	3311880	So that'd be nice.
3311880	3319880	Um, but uh, yeah, um, the fact that they are, um, you know, finally doing this whole personal
3319880	3322600	accounts and maybe that means no more friend code.
3322600	3325960	I hope we'll see.
3325960	3326960	I would hope not.
3326960	3329520	I don't like friend codes there.
3329520	3330520	Who does?
3330520	3331640	Does anyone like friend codes?
3331640	3334040	I don't like friends.
3334040	3338280	No, it was an overrated TV show.
3338280	3339280	I agree.
3339280	3345200	I really don't like that show, except I always liked when what's her face, his hair would
3345200	3349000	frizz out because it totally reminded me of going back to Alabama.
3349000	3355120	All right, so Nintendo network, when will we get like, I know we've had investor information,
3355120	3356440	but when do we get the real information?
3356440	3359040	Have they said anything about that or no?
3359040	3360040	Nope.
3360040	3361040	Soon.
3361040	3362040	E3.
3362040	3363040	Right?
3363040	3364040	Probably.
3364040	3365040	Hey, guess what guys?
3365040	3372000	We have this little technology that we're in implements called patching our games.
3372000	3373000	Downloadable content.
3373000	3377760	It's like getting the new game, but you're downloading extra pieces.
3377760	3382040	Now I know this is totally revolutionary and you only have to pay a hundred Mario coins
3382040	3386000	to unlock the online features.
3386000	3395020	This thing that we're going to call the wifi pass, uh, you need to play the play as Luigi
3395020	3396020	though.
3396020	3400560	They should really, I think that the only two lazy to walk, do you need to buy extra
3400560	3401560	play coins?
3401560	3406220	You can unlock stationary and swap notes DLC that's going to have it.
3406220	3407220	Watch it happen.
3407220	3414080	DLC quest with the first DLC you buy is the ability to walk left and animations.
3414080	3415080	And then I love it.
3415080	3421420	The, uh, sexy outfit, um, DLC that you can get in DLC quests, add sexy outfits to everybody
3421420	3422420	in the game.
3422420	3425080	It's the bikinis all around fun.
3425080	3426080	Good times.
3426080	3428240	All right, well let's move on and talk about guy.
3428240	3432520	Kai, you know, guy Kai is one of those online streaming networks, kind of like on live and
3432520	3433520	so forth.
3433520	3438880	Um, guy Kai is going to be doing a full game streaming services on the various gaming and
3438880	3443480	entertainment websites that they, um, we'll be working with now.
3443480	3444480	Right now.
3444480	3445480	They only do demos.
3445480	3446480	That's the difference right now.
3446480	3450340	Guy Kai specializes in demos, but they are going to be doing full game streaming services.
3450340	3455200	Now here's the thing, one of those partners involved is Facebook, which you know, if you
3455200	3457240	might've heard of it, it's a pretty popular website.
3457240	3463080	Um, also guy Kai is supposed to be doing stuff with YouTube, best buy Walmart, and even directly
3463080	3468240	with the publishers, EA and Ubisoft full game streaming is supposed to go about 90 days
3468240	3472180	after the Facebook version begins, which is going to be very soon.
3472180	3476600	Guy Kai does compete with on live, but, um, the folks behind guy Kai, including the head,
3476600	3480360	Dave Perry says that one of the big difference between the two companies is they have to
3480360	3481680	modify the game.
3481680	3483460	They have to get the source code to the game.
3483460	3486280	Guy Kai does not require modification of the game.
3486280	3490280	So throwing a little shade at the competition, they're saying, basically we can just stream
3490280	3491280	the game.
3491280	3497240	Um, guy Kai is not planned for consoles, uh, but they are, you know, saying, you know,
3497240	3499560	this could work on consoles basically.
3499560	3504800	So very interesting that that could be integrated with Facebook soon.
3504800	3508640	Cause especially because Facebook games, you know, are still kind of a big thing.
3508640	3509760	There's a lot that people play.
3509760	3512740	I've, I've heard that a lot of them are dying.
3512740	3516120	Like there's not nearly as many farmers in Farmville as there were some time ago, but
3516120	3522200	I will admit as terrible as they are, I can't stop playing like the pressure luck.
3522200	3527340	There's a new pressure luck game on Facebook and you get to actually spin the board and
3527340	3529280	hit the button and go, no whammies, no whammies.
3529280	3532740	You know, it's kind of, kind of fun cause you're playing against like real people.
3532740	3535720	So I don't know, dark soccer is giving me that look like she's judging me and I don't
3535720	3536720	like it.
3536720	3538080	Are you judging me?
3538080	3539080	Dark soccer.
3539080	3540080	I'm judging you.
3540080	3542240	Haven't you played Facebook games?
3542240	3543240	There's gotta be a face.
3543240	3548240	I quit a lot of my Facebook games, but you have in the past played that stupid final
3548240	3549240	fantasy one.
3549240	3553280	I was going to say there was the fun nights of the clicky nights of the clicky.
3553280	3555280	And then I was like, what the fuck am I doing?
3555280	3556280	Oh yeah.
3556280	3557280	And I played some social.
3557280	3558280	Oh God.
3558280	3564080	And I got really tired of block.
3564080	3568760	They just, they try too much to, a lot of those Facebook games try way too hard to get
3568760	3570120	your money.
3570120	3574680	Like they need, if they wanted to be smart, they would actually look at, um, like tiny
3574680	3577840	tower I think is a lot more subtle about it.
3577840	3581720	You know, certainly it's there and they're not shy about it, but you know, it's not like
3581720	3584360	in your face all the fricking time.
3584360	3589160	So it's just, plus the game show games that I play kind of do that too.
3589160	3590680	I play who wants to be a millionaire as well.
3590680	3592360	And it's like, you are out of shows.
3592360	3595860	Do you want to buy more shows for the day?
3595860	3597840	But I don't need to play more than once a day.
3597840	3601680	I don't, I don't know, but that's just me.
3601680	3605880	So it would be interesting though, if like full on streaming games, more powerful stuff
3605880	3610040	was coming to Facebook, like, cause some of the, you know, especially games like who wants
3610040	3613120	to be a millionaire and press your luck and the stuff I'm playing don't really have that
3613120	3617200	great animations and Sims social for like the week I was playing it before I blocked
3617200	3618200	it.
3618200	3622800	You know, the animation's kind of old, but imagine if they could have a game like Sims
3622800	3628000	social with Sims three graphical quality to it that actually ran pretty smoothly.
3628000	3631600	Gaikai could bring that, couldn't it maybe.
3631600	3635920	I mean, I know we're talking about streaming, I don't know, Arkham city and things that
3635920	3640360	are already out there on the PC and stuff, but couldn't Facebook games be developed with
3640360	3641360	this in mind.
3641360	3643240	So that's very interesting.
3643240	3647080	So anyhow, well, anything is possible.
3647080	3648080	That's true.
3648080	3649080	All right, moving on.
3649080	3654280	Well, coral, um, X-Box live arcade found what the filter is.
3654280	3655280	Okay.
3655280	3659240	Well, coral is one of those, you know, word games.
3659240	3665800	And uh, if you play it with the parental, uh, filters on, there are a bunch of words
3665800	3668780	that you can't play on the list.
3668780	3678040	There's help train, start dice and God, of course, balls and shaft are not allowed.
3678040	3680840	Um, and then the offensive words are not allowed.
3680840	3686000	Like arse, shit, fuck, cock.
3686000	3694360	But now I heard that see you next Tuesday was allowed somehow was slipping through.
3694360	3702440	Whereas all these other words are blocked, the mother of all curse words is not the source,
3702440	3708400	literally the source of all your cursing.
3708400	3713720	You can say it, you know, I actually don't like that word, but it is a funny word.
3713720	3724120	What kind of, um, there's, um, basically the other, uh, words that, uh,
3724120	3728480	Well, I can't understand what the problem is.
3728480	3733200	Other words that aren't allowed are skid and poop and bung and hung and dice.
3733200	3735080	Oh, great.
3735080	3740680	Now it's sounding like extra first back on the show, bleached asshole.
3740680	3744400	I was going to suggest that to him for that little issue he posted about.
3744400	3745400	Okay.
3745400	3746560	So shut up.
3746560	3749880	Aren't there some actual, like, so there's some words that are blocked that are like
3749880	3751360	very dictionary words.
3751360	3754160	Like why are these hope help, Oh, help.
3754160	3756200	I thought you said hope was hung.
3756200	3761280	So if I want to, if I want to talk about Oscar movies, I cannot talk about the help because
3761280	3762280	it will be blocked.
3762280	3767020	You also can't talk, talk about the picture you hung, huh?
3767020	3770040	You can't talk about having to poop.
3770040	3776360	You can't start anything, but yet you can't roll the dice.
3776360	3777360	Gamers are beat.
3777360	3782320	They're, they are discriminating against tabletop gamers because they don't let dice.
3782320	3783320	I'm offended.
3783320	3787200	They, they are, they are discriminating against my people.
3787200	3789840	But here, this is the, okay.
3789840	3792640	To me, this is the hilarious thing about this story and trains.
3792640	3795840	So we find, Hey, my dad was a conductor for the railroad.
3795840	3796840	That's offensive.
3796840	3797840	That is offensive.
3797840	3799320	You can't say train on X was ever came.
3799320	3804480	But yet, yeah, here's the, this is the hilarious thing to me is that Microsoft bans all these
3804480	3809000	words for whatever reason, like maybe, I don't know, whatever.
3809000	3810000	They're banned.
3810000	3812600	Listen, the Xbox 360 does not start.
3812600	3820040	All I have to, all I have to do is turn on my headset and all I'll hear on Xbox live
3820040	3822360	while I'm probably playing coral.
3822360	3825080	Nice word, fag.
3825080	3826080	This game is gay.
3826080	3829700	Why are you playing this faggy gay game?
3829700	3831960	Because I saw the game blowing some guy in the back.
3831960	3838840	Well, you're playing this game too, so nice little fag better words.
3838840	3841600	It says the quote from go there.
3841600	3846900	The quote from Gary Penn with Denki, the developer, it says a coral uses the Collins official
3846900	3852480	Scrabble dictionary comprising over 110,000 words, up to eight letters in length, including
3852480	3855080	a huge collection of words deemed offensive.
3855080	3861920	So we're talking about like just regularly used words, you know, like how was trained
3861920	3866000	offensive?
3866000	3868880	It's a really shitty band.
3868880	3870320	It's a really shitty band.
3870320	3874440	Unless you're, you know, maybe it's a sex move or something.
3874440	3877880	The train.
3877880	3878880	It's a move in fisting.
3878880	3881840	You don't know what a train is?
3881840	3883880	Rob's looking it up too.
3883880	3887180	You're talking about the human centipede stuff, aren't you?
3887180	3889820	My friend just bought that movie.
3889820	3891720	She loves that movie.
3891720	3892720	Something to that effect.
3892720	3893720	Yes.
3893720	3895600	A train is something to that effect.
3895600	3896600	Okay.
3896600	3899640	Except maybe not sewing someone's ass to their face.
3899640	3900640	It's yeah.
3900640	3901640	Oh, this.
3901640	3903160	Oh my God.
3903160	3907240	Microsoft has forced dance central to remove one of their songs.
3907240	3908640	I can't believe it.
3908640	3912320	This, this song is deemed way too offensive.
3912320	3920640	That's not like she fucking said train.
3920640	3928400	You know, that's, that's a euphemism for big fat cock.
3928400	3932880	She says, listen, she's all come on, ride the big fat cock.
3932880	3934880	Lord.
3934880	3940440	I see.
3940440	3945040	I was thinking it was, you know, maybe a euphemism for fisting.
3945040	3953960	Rob just turned driving sex with Muppets.
3953960	3955800	Gosh.
3955800	3957520	Okay.
3957520	3963040	Allow me to enlighten you to what a train is.
3963040	3966840	I will refer to the official source of all sorts of things like this.
3966840	3967840	The urban dictionary.
3967840	3968840	Urban dictionary.
3968840	3969840	I knew it.
3969840	3973880	A group of guys stand in line outside of a room one by one and they enter a room to have
3973880	3975520	sex with one girl inside.
3975520	3980000	The line must have at least seven guys to be qualified as a train.
3980000	3981000	That is a train.
3981000	3987280	Does that make her the caboose?
3987280	3992400	Well now we understand why the game has banned the word train orange on radio.
3992400	3993400	Got that word ban.
3993400	3994400	Thank you very much.
3994400	3995400	All right.
3995400	3998640	Anyhow, or, or, you know, I'm leaving the room.
3998640	4002920	You guys are dirty or it would be a line of men having intercourse connected by penis
4002920	4008800	to ass.
4008800	4017080	The conductor or man in the back controls, the conductor or man in the back controls
4017080	4020880	the speed while the front controls the direction of the train.
4020880	4023800	As one ejaculates, he will then exit the train.
4023800	4025320	We involve train sound.
4025320	4027320	Is it, is it, is it kind of like this?
4027320	4037160	I'm not sure asked to ask what the hell is asked to wrecking for a dream.
4037160	4039760	Oh, it's the ass.
4039760	4040760	All right.
4040760	4041760	Anyways.
4041760	4042760	Thank you.
4042760	4043760	Urban dictionary.
4043760	4044760	Welcome.
4044760	4045760	All right.
4045760	4046760	I like how I said you're welcome as if I'm urban dictionary.
4046760	4047840	All right, let's move on.
4047840	4053720	Let's stop being 12 and move on to, um, travel around the world and check out what the trains
4053720	4057720	bring into a game store near you as we look at some release dates.
4057720	4062200	Lots of good stuff this week, actually, uh, the only releases for this month, um, that
4062200	4067360	are worth picking up Final Fantasy 13-2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4067360	4069260	Also in a collector's edition.
4069260	4075960	If you want to buy the game with the collector's edition stuff, uh, Soul Calibur 5 on PlayStation
4075960	4080000	3 and Xbox 360 also available in a collector's edition as well.
4080000	4086240	And Never Dead on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which looks like a more action-packed, slightly
4086240	4089680	less strange Shadows of the Dead.
4089680	4094780	And then, um, and that's actually it.
4094780	4095780	And then, uh, nothing.
4095780	4096880	There you go.
4096880	4101120	I thought we might have had, there was, I think, uh, at one point there was, uh, Pro
4101120	4105520	Evolution Soccer 2012 3D for the 3DS, but that's been delayed again.
4105520	4106520	I see.
4106520	4107920	3D balls were considered offensive.
4107920	4114520	Uh, it took extra time to render the balls, you know, they had to pay special attention
4114520	4115520	to the balls.
4115520	4116520	Yeah, that's right.
4116520	4117520	Yep.
4117520	4118520	I know.
4118520	4119520	Or else somebody might get offended.
4119520	4120520	All right.
4120520	4121520	Moving on.
4121520	4122520	Let's check out what's coming out in Japan.
4122520	4123520	We'll start with the Xbox 360.
4123520	4125680	Japan finally gets Dragon Age 2.
4125680	4127720	So you can say meh, just like the rest of us.
4127720	4131880	On February 2nd, 2012 is when Dragon Age 2 finally gets to Japan.
4131880	4136420	Also coming to Japan on February 2nd, Never Dead and Soul Calibur 5 obviously is released
4136420	4139580	here this week and it looks like it's timed pretty well to actually be released in Japan
4139580	4141160	at the same time.
4141160	4145920	Coming to the PlayStation 3, um, a lot of the same stuff, Dragon Age 2, Never Dead,
4145920	4149920	Soul Calibur 5, but you also get Gran Turismo 5 Spec 2012.
4149920	4154160	Uh, I'm not sure exactly what this is, but I want to say this is probably similar, I
4154160	4157040	think you were talking about this in the show, Loki, they were going to put out like a Gran
4157040	4160520	Turismo 5 that came with a bunch of download content, like a good...
4160520	4165560	It came with $20 worth of download content and the Spec 2012 update.
4165560	4169600	They are saying that this new update does the simplified cockpit view.
4169600	4170600	So I guess that's all.
4170600	4173320	It's the Spec 2012 update, they were just calling something different in there.
4173320	4174320	Alright, got it.
4174320	4175320	So that's what Japan is getting.
4175320	4177120	Spec 2.0 is what they're calling it.
4177120	4178880	So Japan gets that, hooray.
4178880	4184480	The Vita is out in Japan and out this week on the Vita is Ragnarok Odyssey.
4184480	4188720	Comes out from Gung-Ho and I believe, if I'm not mistaken, this is the Ragnarok Online
4188720	4190640	game on the Vita, I think.
4190640	4196600	Although, I don't know if it's like specific, oh no, I think this is different.
4196600	4201120	Ragnarok Odyssey pits gamers against giants from Norse myths, so I don't think that's
4201120	4202680	it, but it's like more of an action game.
4202680	4212720	I saw the name and I thought maybe, maybe, alright, anyhow, um, let's see, uh, coming
4212720	4215680	out on other systems.
4215680	4218320	Like a train.
4218320	4219600	That's just never gonna die.
4219600	4224080	I'm trying to see if anything's coming out on the Wii.
4224080	4226020	It's coming out.
4226020	4232080	On the 3DS, Fishing 3D from D3, ooh, Fishing 3D.
4232080	4235080	It's almost like the real thing, just as boring.
4235080	4238720	And lastly, that's it.
4238720	4241120	I guess I could check the PSP real quick.
4241120	4242120	How about it?
4242120	4243120	Photokano.
4243120	4244120	Okay.
4244120	4249800	On the 30th, in the UK, January 30th, we have Call of Cthulhu, The Wasted Land.
4249800	4251920	Call of Cthulhu.
4251920	4257560	And now I have to go to February because this thing's set up really bizarre.
4257560	4263680	And in February, on the 1st, we have Rhythm Party, ooh, on the 2nd, we have Pixel Junk
4263680	4272760	Eden, and on the 3rd, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, Never Dead,
4272760	4276520	and Soulcalibur V.
4276520	4280120	Shane knows a lot about the Vita and what's going on and says that Ragnarok Odyssey is
4280120	4282760	partially the people that did Ragnarok Online.
4282760	4288160	So it's not Ragnarok Online, but it's like them, a lot of the same people making a new
4288160	4289160	thing.
4289160	4290160	Aye.
4290160	4291160	So there you go.
4291160	4292160	Just thought you wanna know.
4292160	4295800	Alright, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna get into the classic game
4295800	4296800	of the week.
4296800	4298840	So let's go to Loki.
4298840	4304280	It's like Ragnarok Wi-Fi ad hoc.
4304280	4307680	Yes, it's just like that.
4307680	4310080	With a 3G connection provided by AT&T, yes.
4310080	4314400	Yes, well in Japan it would be something else.
4314400	4320400	So yeah, the Vita's getting hacked, as usual.
4320400	4324240	But it's not exactly the Vita getting hacked, it's more of the Playstation 3 getting hacked
4324240	4327960	and the Vita kind of benefiting from said hack.
4327960	4333160	Of course with the power of custom firmwares on the Playstation 3, and this has been something
4333160	4338520	that they did with the PSP before where they added more games supported through remote
4338520	4342080	play, they have done the same with the Vita.
4342080	4348440	Now you can support more games via remote play on the Vita, including Batman Arkham
4348440	4354200	Asylum, Battlefield 3, Alice in Madness Returns, Mortal Kombat, and Red Dead Redemption.
4354200	4358600	However, the games display a hefty amount of input lag.
4358600	4366360	Also, they had some extra games that they're gonna be supporting via remote play, including
4366360	4376040	Killzone 3, but those are not yet supported.
4376040	4380240	But it looks like, if I remember correctly, with the PSP there were a lot of games that
4380240	4385560	didn't have remote play enabled, but with hacks were able to get remote play enabled
4385560	4388100	on those, and they actually worked just fine.
4388100	4396080	So there may be more games beyond just those five that they will work and work well.
4396080	4400080	So they have videos online too if you wanna check them out.
4400080	4405160	I mean, I think it'd be pretty awesome to play Battlefield 3 on the Vita or Red Dead.
4405160	4410360	I didn't even think about that the PSP and the PlayStation 3 already have similar connectivity,
4410360	4414120	you know, and it's one of the most underlooked features in the PSP, so the Vita ought to
4414120	4418080	kick it up, and you should be able to play, like, PS3 games streaming, right?
4418080	4421880	Yes, and especially since the controls will be nice instead of having to worry about before
4421880	4425600	where, oh, I only have one analog stick, you know, and now you have dual analog, and to
4425600	4432880	be honest, I mean, they should be supporting, you know, the L2R2 just by tapping a portion
4432880	4438840	of the back touch panel, and then you have pretty much full compatibility with, you know,
4438840	4445240	the DualShock controls, so assuming that you're not gonna run to input lag that's gonna really
4445240	4449320	affect your game, I don't see why more games aren't supporting this.
4449320	4454880	All right, well, I'm hoping to see more of this kind of technology coming to the Vita,
4454880	4460080	because I gotta say, if I could play, like, Final Fantasy XIII-2 on my Vita, like, while
4460080	4464480	I'm in bed, like, you know, just do a little bit of the, do a little bit of the grinding
4464480	4466960	in my bedroom.
4466960	4471160	I'm in experience grinding, you sick perv, stop laughing over there, DarkSakura.
4471160	4473400	You certainly are experienced, huh?
4473400	4474400	Bitch.
4474400	4475400	All right.
4475400	4477200	Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.
4477200	4480840	I would, I would love to do that, like, that would be so awesome, like, it's almost like
4480840	4487160	a, I mean, what, isn't the Wii U's whole point kind of moot if the PlayStation can do that
4487160	4488160	same thing?
4488160	4489160	Sort of.
4489160	4492720	Sort of, except for the fact that it'll be a way more expensive on the PlayStation 3,
4492720	4493720	I'm sure.
4493720	4495720	But it's just, I don't know.
4495720	4497680	AlphaCananagram wants to make a good point, though.
4497680	4503680	The thing is, PS3 is Wi-Fi G, not Wi-Fi N, so it's gonna suck.
4503680	4510200	Yes, but at the same time, you know, who's to say the next system's not gonna be, I'd
4510200	4512080	assume the next system's gonna be Wi-Fi N.
4512080	4514000	Are you already thinking about Vita II?
4514000	4516000	No, I'm talking about the, um...
4516000	4518200	Oh, oh, the, oh, I'm sorry, the PS3.
4518200	4519200	Oh, that's a good point.
4519200	4523080	I don't know if the Vita is N. I think it might be.
4523080	4524080	It just occurred to me.
4524080	4525080	Might be G.
4525080	4529600	There's another game that I played today, but we're bringing it up.
4529600	4531480	I played with the Sony tablet.
4531480	4532480	Oh?
4532480	4538960	Um, the, what's it called, the tablet S, and it has PlayStation games on it, but I was
4538960	4540880	playing the Uncharted pinball game today.
4540880	4541880	Oh.
4541880	4547720	But it was, I was thinking about that, you know, if they've got PlayStation, um, I think
4547720	4555160	it said some PS2 games, too, on, um, on their little tablet, then it actually seems to,
4555160	4560680	you know, that it wouldn't be that hard for them to have the Vita that played, you know,
4560680	4562800	your PS3 games.
4562800	4564800	AlphaCananagram has another great suggestion here.
4564800	4570500	They need to release an updated PS3 or some sort of dongle to upgrade the Wi-Fi N, for
4570500	4576280	the Vita's Wi-Fi N. And dongle, who, he's changed his name, is confirming the Vita does
4576280	4577840	have an N in it.
4577840	4586400	To be honest, you could do that with a Wi-Fi N bridge, um, you could, you know, upgrade
4586400	4592360	your connection or, you know, have a router that's Wi-Fi N that you connect, you know,
4592360	4595680	physically to your PS3 and then have it stream from there.
4595680	4600120	But yeah, I mean, next system, you know, obviously gonna be N, probably will be able to support
4600120	4602800	a lot more streaming, especially if you're gonna be downloading games and stuff, and
4602800	4604320	I mean, that could be kinda cool.
4604320	4609720	You could see a lot of new functionality with the Vita with that, um, although by the time
4609720	4614200	that that system comes out, the Vita could be dead in the water already, so, let's hope
4614200	4615200	not.
4615200	4622760	Alright, well, let's move on to another story here I have on THQ, of course, the makers
4622760	4624880	of Saints Row, right?
4624880	4628280	Uh, apparently it's gonna be refocusing a bit over THQ.
4628280	4632080	First, I should say this, there were some crazy-ass rumors this week that THQ was, like,
4632080	4633760	gonna just fuckin' fold.
4633760	4634760	Like, right?
4634760	4637440	Weren't they going around Twitter like THQ is just done, they're waiting, they're gonna
4637440	4638440	get bought.
4638440	4640880	That was like a couple weeks ago that they were, like, gonna stop.
4640880	4642320	Oh, we haven't been here for a couple weeks.
4642320	4643880	Well, they had canceled their 2014 portfolio.
4643880	4648040	Oh yeah, they canceled their entire 2014 lineup, yes, I remember now.
4648040	4652960	Well, here's what happened is that what's actually happening is that THQ is going to
4652960	4658760	renew its focus to be on core game franchises and not traditional kids licensed video games.
4658760	4662520	Sorry, guys, no more SpongeBob SquarePants.
4662520	4664720	And somebody else will pick up the license, I'm sure.
4664720	4670760	But anyway, um, UFC, Darksiders, Company of Heroes, Insane, Saints Row, Warhammer 40k,
4670760	4674640	and so on, these are all still in production and there will be that going forward.
4674640	4676760	They have a ton of fuckin' titles coming out.
4676760	4680620	I mean, I'm not surprised that they're, I mean, look at the titles that are coming out
4680620	4681620	from THQ.
4681620	4685000	They have the fuckin' South Park RPG game that's coming out at the end of the year.
4685000	4688080	I mean, they've got plenty of big titles.
4688080	4693200	I mean, they're on par with, like, EA and, you know, Activision, I mean, they're easily
4693200	4695120	one of the top three.
4695120	4698800	I mean, hell, even First Party can't really top, you know, I mean, First Party doesn't
4698800	4702720	have a lot of titles coming out anymore, but yeah, they're not going anywhere.
4702720	4707560	I mean, if you're gonna see another company die, it's gonna be, like, Konami or, you know,
4707560	4714400	maybe even, like, Capcom, one of the smaller guys, like, D3, you know, I can see them folding.
4714400	4718200	South Peak, they could have very well already folded.
4718200	4720400	Yeah, it's gonna be one of those.
4720400	4721400	It's not gonna be THQ.
4721400	4723520	They're not gonna just all of a sudden get bought out.
4723520	4725400	They have a ton of properties.
4725400	4730160	Well, one thing that didn't work out so well for them was the U-Draw tablet, and I think
4730160	4734560	that's part of what's probably not going to be so much coming out of THQ in the future.
4734560	4738800	Hey, did you remember the Ubisoft tablet that they had?
4738800	4739800	No.
4739800	4742400	Yeah, that's, nobody did either.
4742400	4743720	That came out around Christmas.
4743720	4747880	Um, what, I thought one of those tablets did quite well.
4747880	4748880	Was that the first?
4748880	4751200	It was the first U-Draw on the Wii.
4751200	4754320	But then when they tried to kind of put it everywhere, it didn't do so well, right?
4754320	4758320	And I don't really know if it did well, it did alright, but I'm glad that's gone, because
4758320	4763920	it was, it had potential, but what, the problem with that tablet is you didn't have anybody
4763920	4767680	coming on, like, they were saying, oh yeah, Nintendo's gonna develop some titles for the
4767680	4768680	U-Draw tablet.
4768680	4773020	If they had done that, then yeah, it would have kicked ass on the Wii, but since there
4773020	4778760	wasn't a Mario Paint or anything like that on the U-Draw, it just died, you know, no
4778760	4779760	one cares.
4779760	4782360	Because it's a peripheral that's going to be used for a couple of games, and that's
4782360	4783360	it.
4783360	4790200	Alright, well, let's take a minute to go down memory lane, and think about a time when we
4790200	4794720	weren't so worried about games' financial situations, we didn't have these tablet things
4794720	4800880	that were coming out and destroying game companies, it's the classic game of the week.
4800880	4805040	Dark Soccer is going to dive head first into the classic gaming vault and find a game that
4805040	4808480	she says, hey, you kids, better respect.
4808480	4811640	And you picked a real oldie but goodie tonight, didn't you?
4811640	4813160	I picked one of my favorite old games.
4813160	4816840	Alright, and you think, how many episodes have you done the classic game of the week
4816840	4817840	now?
4817840	4818840	It started episode 250, right?
4818840	4821520	So damn near 200 classic games of the week.
4821520	4822520	Yeah.
4822520	4827080	And you're still finding ones you kind of forgot, or whatever, just never did before.
4827080	4836480	Well, and actually this game last night from Dan and I, we were watching this, like, series
4836480	4839000	of Colecovision games.
4839000	4842280	So I had to go back to the Colecovision with something that I grew up with.
4842280	4843280	So I picked Mousetrap.
4843280	4844280	Mousetrap.
4844280	4848440	Now tell me if you remember this gaming company, Exedy.
4848440	4851720	You know what Exedy stands for?
4851720	4853360	I didn't know it stood for anything.
4853360	4855320	Is the portmanteau of excellence in dynamics.
4855320	4856720	I didn't know that.
4856720	4858680	I remember the name Exedy, though.
4858680	4859680	Yeah.
4859680	4863200	So maybe it's Exedy, since it's dynamics.
4863200	4868080	Anyway, Mousetrap was basically, I don't know what everyone's going to say, it was a Pac-Man
4868080	4869080	clone.
4869080	4876920	Well, unlike Zynga, Exedy decided to actually innovate on the genre and throw in a few other
4876920	4878600	twists.
4878600	4885160	With Mousetrap, and the one that I linked, and if you will share that with Rama, I shared
4885160	4887880	the Colecovision version because that's the one that I grew up with.
4887880	4894720	Although it was in the arcade, it was a pretty good game, the Atari version is shit.
4894720	4900560	So moving forward, you've got these, you play as a mouse and you're being chased by cats
4900560	4905920	and you are eating up little pieces of cheese and you can collect bones.
4905920	4910840	Now the bones, as opposed to how the power pills work, you store up your bones and you
4910840	4914600	activate them at a certain time that you choose.
4914600	4917320	You can save all of your bones and not use them in that level.
4917320	4920760	I mean, you don't, you have to start over the next level, but still, you know, you don't
4920760	4922200	have to use all your bones.
4922200	4925860	But with, you have the bones, you turn into a dog and the dog, you know, bites the cats
4925860	4930160	and sends the cats back into their little places that aren't in the center of the screen,
4930160	4934800	they are on the, uh, each side of the screen.
4934800	4939560	In the center, you have a little area that says in, and when you go through the in, it
4939560	4944280	actually puts you into one of the four corners at random, you don't get to control.
4944280	4949440	Actually, I think there was a way to determine which one, but I think it had, depending on
4949440	4951880	how you entered the little thing.
4951880	4958640	So, um, you, uh, actually, instead of there being four enemies on screen, you had six
4958640	4960640	cats.
4960640	4965320	And they, uh, had point multipliers, 100 for the first, 300 for the second, 500 for
4965320	4972000	the third, 700, 900, and that was it.
4972000	4975040	And of course, it resets every time you use a new bone.
4975040	4979440	Um, now, the cats, though, will respawn faster.
4979440	4984360	As you got through later levels, you also had a hawk that would pop up that would, uh,
4984360	4989580	eat both the mouse and the dog, if you were the dog, and you, um, the only way to get,
4989580	4994080	to change its direction from going right after you, was to go in the infield in the center
4994080	4997020	so that it would just go to a random place.
4997020	5002560	You also had, uh, bonus, um, items that, when you got one, a next one would appear, and
5002560	5005880	your bonus items, they would also be towards the different corners.
5005880	5010920	Uh, there are a thousand points each and would increase by 200 points for each subsequent
5010920	5013720	ply, so the last one was 7,200 points.
5013720	5018280	The items are, there's 32 of them, there's a wedge of swiss cheese, a paperclip, a safety
5018280	5022760	pin, a key, an apple, a trophy, a candlestick, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, a pair
5022760	5027560	of eyeglasses, a clock, a bottle, a gem, a bugle, a screw, a hammer, a diamond ring,
5027560	5032040	a lightbulb, a sewing needle, a fork, a thimble, a knife, a cocktail glass, a fishbone, a pear,
5032040	5039040	a peanut, a dye, a telephone handset, a dye with C-A-F on the faces, I guess that would
5039040	5043640	be like a block, a spool of thread, a teacup, and a pistol, what a mouse needs a pistol
5043640	5047800	for, and a martini glass, and eyeglasses, I have no freaking clue.
5047800	5052500	Some of the 80s games had the strangest power-ups in them, though, you know.
5052500	5058580	You also get a 10,000 point bonus for clearing the board of all cheese, and if you end the
5058580	5063680	stage as the dog, you will begin the next stage as the dog, which is kind of stupid
5063680	5065120	because the cats don't really appear.
5065120	5071320	Now here is, I think, the really innovative part of the game, are the doors.
5071320	5076760	And with the doors, you had three different colors, you had a yellow, a red, and a blue
5076760	5081000	door, that if you pressed that colored button, the door would open and close.
5081000	5085960	And my goal, every time I played the damn game, was to trap the cats.
5085960	5089440	And I was really good at trapping the cats, because then you trap the cats, you don't
5089440	5091680	have to worry about them hunting you down.
5091680	5097960	You just, you know, you may have to go around another door, but, you know, what's a little
5097960	5100200	inconvenience for safety, you know?
5100200	5101200	Right.
5101200	5105120	Now this is not to be confused, as some people are saying in the chat room here, the board
5105120	5108640	game, yes, Torment is saying, my mom loved that game, she would set up for hours playing
5108640	5111720	Mouse Trap, but there was somebody else that says that before that, Torment didn't just
5111720	5117680	come out and say that, somebody said, somebody said something about the board game in there.
5117680	5121760	The board game is not the same as the arcade game.
5121760	5124600	But the board game is awesome in its own way.
5124600	5127320	And it had lots of breakable parts, and it really pissed me off.
5127320	5128320	Yes.
5128320	5132240	I could never get the little dude to flip the right way at the end.
5132240	5136280	So yeah, my thing was always trapping the cats, and then just having free reign of the
5136280	5142120	board, and, oh, I can take my time, ooh, look at you mousies, I mean, kitty cats trapped
5142120	5144120	in the little areas.
5144120	5145120	So there were different ports.
5145120	5153320	Like I said, I had the ColecoVision version, which to me was the most true version, I think.
5153320	5158480	It had fewer prizes, and you could actually have an option to leave out the hawk, and
5158480	5162400	the sound effects were a little different, but as far as, you know, having the doors
5162400	5167400	and everything, it was probably the closest to the arcade you could get.
5167400	5175040	The Intellivision one actually added an audio warning when the cats were entering the maze,
5175040	5177480	but the graphics were blockier.
5177480	5183440	And then the Atari 2600 version, okay, you know how awful Pac-Man looked on the Atari
5183440	5184440	2600?
5184440	5190840	Yeah, I'm looking at the videos now, because I want to say I played this one.
5190840	5193120	Similarly hideous.
5193120	5195560	And no sound.
5195560	5196560	Very quiet.
5196560	5198840	Block, block, block, block, block, block.
5198840	5203340	Actually my friend had this game, we used to play this all the time, but it only had
5203340	5204340	the one door.
5204340	5209400	Yeah, only the one color door, and it flickers instead of really opens, it just vanishes.
5209400	5210400	Yeah.
5210400	5218640	So it's not really good, and you had reduced scoring in it, it had no hawk, the in area
5218640	5223960	is missing, like from the center, so you didn't have your little teleport boxes.
5223960	5228840	You only have three cats instead of six, and all the doors move at the same time.
5228840	5232200	So it was really just bastardized.
5232200	5237560	However, now, you remember the song Pac-Man Fever, Rob?
5237560	5239360	Of course I do.
5239360	5245960	Pac-Man Fever, Bugner and Garcia, well they also did a song called Mouse Trap on the same
5245960	5246960	album.
5246960	5248760	I did not know that.
5248760	5252720	It was made using the sound effects from the game.
5252720	5256360	A little note on here from the article I'm reading is that when they re-recorded the
5256360	5264080	album in 1999, they could not find the machine, and so had to use sounds from nature.
5264080	5267680	Let's see, I'm actually, I found it here on the good old YouTube that has everything.
5267680	5285200	Wow, they do really just sing about the game, don't they?
5285200	5292440	Well, they do with Pac-Man Fever.
5292440	5296760	Rest in peace by the way, that guy died last year.
5296760	5299320	One of them, there was two of the guys died last year.
5299320	5300320	Anyhow.
5300320	5306200	So that's the game, and again, it was one of my all-time favorites, and my mother would
5306200	5310320	sit and play this for hours, although her game was Space Fury.
5310320	5311320	Alright.
5311320	5315640	Classic Game of the Week, folks, is Mouse Trap for the ColecoVision, or you know, really
5315640	5317960	it did start in the arcade, so there it is.
5317960	5322560	I'm gonna say, if you want to play it at home, without maim, ColecoVision.
5322560	5324000	Alright, that's the way to go.
5324000	5326000	Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week.
5326000	5328080	We're gonna be back, there's plenty more of Orange Laundrio to come.
5328080	5329080	We have a list list tonight.
5329080	5333520	We're gonna be doing a list list, tonight's list list is inspired by Twitter.
5333520	5336440	There was a listener on Twitter that said you should do this as a topic, and I'm like,
5336440	5337440	okay, we can do that.
5337440	5342180	So we are gonna do a list list, Alan's gonna join us for that here in a little bit, and
5342180	5346800	we'll get to more of that in part B, and we're gonna talk a little bit about a new pocket
5346800	5351760	system that could have Dark Sakura, very excited, we'll see some other Nintendo updates and
5351760	5352760	more when we come back.
5352760	5357160	Your calls and your Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, get those in, and plenty more
5357160	5366200	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5366200	5369080	Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5369080	5374800	We are live on January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.
5374800	5377120	You know, if you've never listened to Orange Lounge Radio live, you really should consider
5377120	5378120	it sometime.
5378120	5382280	We are, of course, I do something, I know some of our listeners are overseas, so like
5382280	5385920	if you guys are in Europe, it is really hard to listen to our show unless you have severe
5385920	5386920	insomnia.
5386920	5389320	So I apologize for that, but that is why we have a podcast.
5389320	5393860	But for those of you guys who are in the States, your excuses are severely numbered.
5393860	5398720	So we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, of course,
5398720	5400220	and we do have the chat room.
5400220	5403360	And when you're not here with us in live chat, you miss fun things like Dark Sakura's having
5403360	5405040	a contest right now.
5405040	5407480	Whoever can guess her bra size gets to buy her a taco.
5407480	5415080	Now, I'm not sure how there's a winner in that situation.
5415080	5419640	There's two winners and they're both me because everyone gets to know what a fantastic rack
5419640	5420640	I have.
5420640	5421640	And I also get a taco.
5421640	5423640	Can I just put pics on OLR?
5423640	5424640	No.
5424640	5425640	No.
5425640	5428320	And then I am kind of wearing a cleavage-y shirt today.
5428320	5429320	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5429320	5432800	Actually, I keep saying OLR.com, but that's not our site.
5432800	5434080	And my hair is cute.
5434080	5435080	You do look cute today.
5435080	5436440	I put effort into my hair today.
5436440	5441400	Considering how, like, shitty I felt, mad you were, I don't know, yeah, angsty you were
5441400	5442400	earlier.
5442400	5447240	A, you've seemed like the show has helped you unwind a little bit, and B, you might
5447240	5449520	be in a bad mood, but you're looking good.
5449520	5451520	Oh, yeah.
5451520	5452520	Yeah.
5452520	5454120	Pissy bitch gotta be hot.
5454120	5455520	All right.
5455520	5456520	All right.
5456520	5459880	We're going to do some rapid-fire news.
5459880	5462840	Believe it or not, we're not just a video game show about boobies.
5462840	5465600	Although, don't get me wrong, everybody loves boobies.
5465600	5466600	Loki?
5466600	5467600	Boobies?
5467600	5469960	He gave the big thumbs up.
5469960	5470960	Great radio.
5470960	5471960	Dark Sakura?
5471960	5472960	Boobies?
5472960	5473960	Yeah.
5473960	5474960	And I love boobies, too.
5474960	5475960	Boobies are great.
5475960	5479960	Oh, is Dark Sakura taking a picture of her boobies?
5479960	5482560	I'm just gonna put a picture up.
5482560	5483560	Oh, okay.
5483560	5485320	That kind of comes with the radio show territory.
5485320	5486320	What?
5486320	5487320	Taking pictures of boobs.
5487320	5493320	It's just, you know, you eventually devolve into that type of show.
5493320	5494320	Yeah.
5494320	5495320	There's the picture.
5495320	5496320	See?
5496320	5497320	You gotta put that on the site.
5497320	5498320	I am.
5498320	5499320	All right.
5499320	5500320	Moving on.
5500320	5503320	All right.
5503320	5505320	Let's talk about Skylanders.
5505320	5506320	Yay.
5506320	5507320	Skylanders.
5507320	5508320	Your favorite game.
5508320	5509320	It's my favorite game.
5509320	5510320	What a different type of boob.
5510320	5511320	Hey, you know what?
5511320	5512320	Here's the thing.
5512320	5517980	You can't win here if you can't avoid them, then at least benefit from them, but that's
5517980	5518980	another story.
5518980	5519980	Anyways, Skylanders.
5519980	5526520	So, apparently Activision has grabbed the rights to a domain called Skylanders Giants,
5526520	5531640	so you can probably guess that's probably gonna be the next Skylander game or whatever.
5531640	5536120	So Skylander Giants coming to a store near you.
5536120	5538360	You wanna hear something funny?
5538360	5544920	So as I mentioned weeks prior that those toys are so hard to find right now that they're
5544920	5552760	going for astronomical prices on auction sites like eBay and Amazon, Activision, cause most
5552760	5558040	companies eventually they will drop the price of their merchandise.
5558040	5559400	Oh no, no, no, no.
5559400	5562360	They are raising the price of the merchandise.
5562360	5565280	Those toys, remember how they used to cost you like eight bucks or whatever?
5565280	5568160	They're gonna cost you one additional dollar to buy that.
5568160	5571520	That's like, that'd be like those Call of Duty map packs selling so well that they're
5571520	5574280	gonna charge more money for them.
5574280	5575280	But guess what?
5575280	5577400	You stupid fuckers will keep buying them.
5577400	5581960	And so that's why Skylanders Giants is allowed to exist.
5581960	5586720	So don't you fucking bitch and complain about your goddamn map packs costing too much because
5586720	5590200	it's all your fucking fault for buying those stupid Skylander toys.
5590200	5591200	Why are you so angry?
5591200	5592200	You're so angry.
5592200	5594760	Yeah, I'm not fucking angry.
5594760	5598280	I'll make a quick buck off of those fucking toys.
5598280	5602360	So whatever, you know.
5602360	5605520	I'm gonna be laughing all the way to the bank.
5605520	5609200	Because you people can't get your hands on those toys.
5609200	5616200	Anyways, Capcom has announced Ace Eternity 5 that's gonna be coming out soon thanks to
5616200	5619220	their wonderful logo which is completely in Japanese.
5619220	5623720	But I do see a five, so I know that it's Ace Eternity 5.
5623720	5629280	And of course they've offered nothing whatsoever as far as specifics about the game, but eh,
5629280	5630280	whatever.
5630280	5637040	And also there's the Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney series for the 3DS that's been
5637040	5641400	announced and the game's due out this year.
5641400	5646040	And also of course they're gonna be doing some HD versions of some of the older Ace
5646040	5647040	Attorney games.
5647040	5656640	One through three are coming to IOS platforms soon with refresh sprites and that fun stuff.
5656640	5661280	And last but not least, there's a new game coming out on the Playstation 3 for the Move.
5661280	5670720	And it's gonna allow you to use your Playstation Move controllers to engage in combat.
5670720	5677960	Looks almost like that Kinect game that they have coming out from the guys that do Crysis
5677960	5678960	from Crytek.
5678960	5685160	Very, you know, Roman combat type stuff.
5685160	5691560	Anyways, the game's called Quandramortis and it's done by the guys that did the fight the
5691560	5692560	lights out.
5692560	5694640	So they know a little bit about battle games.
5694640	5697000	They also know about games that don't sell well.
5697000	5702040	So it's hard to say whether that game will do well or not.
5702040	5703040	Yeah.
5703040	5707920	And you'll be able to fight against your friends over the Playstation.
5707920	5714720	Also if you happen to not want to engage in move combat or multi-move controller combat,
5714720	5716880	you can still use a regular controller as well.
5716880	5720800	So it's nice to at least have that option in there.
5720800	5721800	All right.
5721800	5724680	Well, moving on to some other rapid fire news.
5724680	5728900	I think I need a correct musical background for this because it's one of the greatest
5728900	5730960	theme songs ever.
5730960	5732960	Hopefully it'll work.
5732960	5737320	It's the Muppet Show!
5737320	5748520	Ah, that's right, I played this song because Muppets DLC is coming to LittleBigPlanet 2!
5748520	5750520	That's right, Sackboys will meet the Muppets.
5750520	5752520	This is going to be so awesome.
5752520	5758320	Like, I have to admit, I'm so embarrassed because I never really got into LittleBigPlanet
5758320	5759320	2.
5759320	5761320	Like, I never just bought it because I was like, oh no, there's a stellar game right
5761320	5762320	now.
5762320	5763320	I can't do it.
5763320	5764320	But I love LittleBigPlanet 1.
5764320	5766480	So this might seriously push me over the edge right here.
5766480	5771080	I've got to get LittleBigPlanet 2 because now there's Muppet DLC in it.
5771080	5775240	It's going to have two new minigames, five new levels, a new soundtrack, objects, voices,
5775240	5779760	new trophies, twelve new kids, and a Ralph the Dog costume.
5779760	5781120	Outstanding.
5781120	5786600	It's going to cost $5.99 and it actually just came out this week.
5786600	5789520	Also a new game mechanic is the Attract-O-Gel.
5789520	5792140	Now Sackboy can walk on walls and ceilings.
5792140	5797600	And any object can do the same thanks to the Attract-O-Gel.
5797600	5798600	Amazing.
5798600	5802080	You know, I haven't played through LittleBigPlanet 2 at all, other than like the first level
5802080	5803080	or so.
5803080	5804640	I should probably go back.
5804640	5805640	Oh man.
5805640	5808960	It's just one of those games that unfortunately just came out at a really bad time, so I kind
5808960	5811960	of missed it.
5811960	5813320	The first one was so, so good.
5813320	5816600	I can't imagine how the second one is suddenly bad.
5816600	5821520	Anyhow, rumors going around, big rumors that Wii U might change their name.
5821520	5827500	Nintendo is seriously considering renaming the Wii U and it has to do with the fact that,
5827500	5831200	I guess a lot of people were confused by the 3DS and the fact that the 3DS and the way
5831200	5836000	they're kind of selling it looks so similar to the DS that people think the 3DS is just
5836000	5840660	a souped up DS, although I'm kind of like, well that's what it is, isn't it?
5840660	5842880	But whatever.
5842880	5846560	So Nintendo is very scared about this because maybe it's too similar.
5846560	5850080	So they're thinking that folks will see Wii U and think it's just the same thing, that
5850080	5852840	they already have one at home.
5852840	5857440	I don't know how much I'm on board with this, but I don't really care for the name Wii U,
5857440	5863240	but then again I didn't really like the name Wii and it kind of grew on everybody, so those
5863240	5865880	jokes will never get old.
5865880	5869560	I'm noticing this thread on Destructoid, which is one of the sites that ran the news story,
5869560	5874260	had some comments for people suggesting a new name and a lot of people are suggesting
5874260	5879080	a lot of the development names like Ultra, Dolphin, whatever, but I think honestly the
5879080	5884400	best name I saw in here was Nintendo HD.
5884400	5887040	What a great name for the console, just fucking call it what it is.
5887040	5888040	It's Nintendo HD.
5888040	5890680	I think that's the best suggestion I saw in there.
5890680	5894280	Loki you look like you're wanting to comment on this or something.
5894280	5896800	That sounds fine to me, that makes sense.
5896800	5898800	Wii U, do you love the name Wii U?
5898800	5901280	Do you hope it sticks?
5901280	5907580	Well I am very fond of the movie Kung Pao and yes, Wii U does tie into Kung Pao quite
5907580	5913760	a lot, so I am hoping it sticks just because of all the wonderful Kung Pao clips they get
5913760	5914760	to watch.
5914760	5915760	Wii U, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U.
5915760	5916760	Yeah, yeah.
5916760	5920740	You should be able to beat him now.
5920740	5925080	Also Nintendo has announced that at their recent online thing that they do with investors,
5925080	5927400	one of the other things they talked about, not just the Nintendo network, but another
5927400	5934020	little gem slipped in there, a new 2D Mario game that will be released in the next fiscal
5934020	5939620	year, meaning before March 2013, that will be on the 3DS.
5939620	5943800	So I know that sounds a little weird because we're talking a 2D game on the 3DS, but think
5943800	5948440	New Super Mario Brothers Wii, something like that, on the 3DS, which wouldn't surprise
5948440	5951940	anybody because that was a huge seller, and that's a game I'm sure they could crank out
5951940	5952940	no problem.
5952940	5956400	New Super Mario Brothers Wii wasn't a bad game by any means either.
5956400	5957400	It was pretty good.
5957400	5961560	Yeah, I already played that on my 3DS, it was called New Super Mario Brothers for the
5961560	5964280	3DS.
5964280	5969280	Well there'll probably be a 3D one of those as well that just has slight 3D in it or something.
5969280	5971600	But I wouldn't go expecting Mario 3D Land.
5971600	5975600	But you know what, who gives a shit, you know what, you don't need to even fucking change
5975600	5979600	any of the goddamn game mechanics as long as you make completely all new levels.
5979600	5984280	No one cares, it's just, it's a Mario game, oh my god.
5984280	5986040	Just make really fun levels and done.
5986040	5990760	You don't need to like, make something brand new every time.
5990760	5994960	That's not to say that you shouldn't make brand new things because, you know, they've
5994960	6002400	been, you know, they've had the problem with releasing games that they've changed nothing
6002400	6009960	for like ages on, Animal Crossing, or you know, it's just like any of the new play control
6009960	6010960	things.
6010960	6015280	I mean, they should change a little bit, but you know, it's not to say that the old stuff
6015280	6018040	wasn't good.
6018040	6022920	Some comments on our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, Rama says, no, just call it Nintendo.
6022920	6024960	The Nintendo, Nintendo.
6024960	6028380	You know, that's been suggested a lot, and that was even rumored, one of the titles at
6028380	6034360	one point, but the NES was the Nintendo, and I think, I don't know, I just, I like Nintendo
6034360	6040520	HD or Wii HD, just something, I like to keep it simple, but that might be too simple.
6040520	6044520	Call it the Nintendo money press because it prints money.
6044520	6049560	Some other comments on our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, Dongle says, give me true Super Mario World
6049560	6052600	sequel with 2D art in 3D.
6052600	6055560	AhMyEye says, I want a good Yoshi's Island sequel.
6055560	6061840	Well, yeah, Super Mario Bros. 2 Yoshi's Island, that was one of the best.
6061840	6063840	Weeee, weeee, weeee, weeee.
6063840	6064840	No, thank you.
6064840	6065840	All right.
6065840	6068400	Anyhow, let's move on, DarkSakura.
6068400	6072120	Well, we do have a few other things.
6072120	6076360	It would also be good if I did not have the mailbag pulled up over it.
6076360	6080800	So how about Street Fighter X Tekken?
6080800	6089600	There's some interesting news, and that is a weird picture of Mega Man.
6089600	6090840	It's Mr. Mega Man.
6090840	6091840	Mr. Mega Man?
6091840	6094920	Well, it's technically Mega Man.
6094920	6102640	He's in the pose from the American box art for the first Mega Man, and that's just weird.
6102640	6106600	Also, the image of his showing, so I can link it in the chatroom, so.
6106600	6112080	But it was, yeah, bizarre.
6112080	6115520	And also Pac-Man's in it, which I don't get.
6115520	6117240	Well, the Pac-Man thing was cool.
6117240	6119040	Have you seen the trailer with him in action yet?
6119040	6120040	No.
6120040	6121040	Because it's, okay.
6121040	6124200	Pac-Man, this is worth, yeah, because this is the weird thing.
6124200	6127840	Like, Pac-Man sounds stupid to me, but wait until you see what they did to Pac-Man.
6127840	6129680	You're gonna say the same thing I did, I bet.
6129680	6131520	Well, it said with mechanical assistance.
6131520	6133640	Well, it's a very specific mechanical.
6133640	6134640	It's Pac-Man.
6134640	6136560	Let her see, because she's a Tekken fan.
6136560	6141160	Don't spoil it!
6141160	6143520	Or I will throw a cartoon Megan Fox at you.
6143520	6144520	All right, let's see.
6144520	6145520	Ah, here it is.
6145520	6149160	Okay, let's, uh, I hope this isn't some stupid-ass parody or something.
6149160	6150720	Let's see here.
6150720	6152160	No!
6152160	6153160	I hate YouTube advertisements.
6153160	6154160	Damn it.
6154160	6155160	Damn it.
6155160	6156160	Damn it.
6156160	6157160	All right, hold on.
6157160	6158160	We gotta...
6158160	6159160	It's some dude proposing to some chick.
6159160	6160160	No, no, no, no.
6160160	6161160	She's not gonna marry you.
6161160	6162160	What?
6162160	6163160	What were you saying?
6163160	6164160	It's a stupid commercial.
6164160	6167520	Oh, we're not gonna watch the stupid commercial.
6167520	6168760	We had to get through it.
6168760	6169760	We had to get through it.
6169760	6170760	Here we go.
6170760	6171760	Warning.
6171760	6172760	The following trailer may...
6172760	6173760	God damn it!
6173760	6174760	It's just some...
6174760	6177760	Ah, I see a lot of warnings.
6177760	6178760	I don't think that was...
6178760	6181400	I hate when people take the videos and...
6181400	6182400	There we go.
6182400	6183400	That was just on it, Rob.
6183400	6184400	Oh.
6184400	6185400	Ah, you ruined it.
6185400	6186400	Sorry, I closed it.
6186400	6187400	Hold on.
6187400	6188400	Let me do one more.
6188400	6189400	This is great, great radio.
6189400	6190400	Let's try this one.
6190400	6191400	Geez, Rob.
6191400	6192400	That's a website I know.
6192400	6193400	So this ought to be something I can trust.
6193400	6194400	I like machinima.
6194400	6195400	Come on.
6195400	6196400	Play the trailer.
6196400	6197400	Here we go.
6197400	6198400	Crude humor.
6198400	6205400	That's like this show with its trains.
6205400	6218240	I love the cat.
6218240	6219240	So Mega Man looks terrible.
6219240	6220240	The fuck is that?
6220240	6229480	Oh, he's in the Tetsujin outfit.
6229480	6230480	That is cool.
6230480	6231480	Okay, cool's okay.
6231480	6235480	Cool makes sense.
6235480	6243880	Yay, Kuro and Toto.
6243880	6250360	That's awful.
6250360	6252240	They've got to be just trolling us with that.
6252240	6253400	No, that's the real deal.
6253400	6256480	It has, um, what's his name's Kenji Nefuni's blessing.
6256480	6258120	No, no, no, hold on.
6258120	6261280	It has his blessing from a year ago.
6261280	6265520	Prior to the whole Mega Man stuff being canceled prior to him leaving the company.
6265520	6266520	Yeah.
6266520	6268320	He's like, Hey, you wanted to use that in the game?
6268320	6269320	Okay.
6269320	6270320	Yeah, sure.
6270320	6271320	That's fine.
6271320	6272320	I'm going to work on making Mega Man Legends three.
6272320	6273320	Oh, by the way, we're letting you go.
6273320	6278600	Or it's like, yeah, that, that is the whole, yeah.
6278600	6281080	Blessing from a year ago is what he has.
6281080	6284920	But I mean, now it's just like fans are pissed off that you won't make a mega game.
6284920	6289200	He won't put Mega Man in Mega Man, you know, ultimate, uh, Marvel vs Capcom three.
6289200	6290960	And then you pull this fucking shit.
6290960	6294360	You might as well just dressed up Frank West as Mega Man, cause that would be less offensive
6294360	6295360	than this.
6295360	6299200	It's funny watching what's happening because a lot of people are like, like it's really
6299200	6302840	interesting cause a lot of gamers are looking at this going, not funny.
6302840	6304040	This is not funny.
6304040	6305120	Like gamers.
6305120	6307880	I feel like gamers are like actually offended by that.
6307880	6309020	Let's let's let's dark soccer.
6309020	6310520	You just saw it for the first time.
6310520	6313640	Are you having that reaction to, it's not funny.
6313640	6315200	I feel like I've got to throw up.
6315200	6318400	I mean, I'm not, I have a headache now.
6318400	6323320	I started to have a headache earlier and it was going away as I started to feel better,
6323320	6325840	but now I feel nauseous and my headache has come back.
6325840	6328480	Think about Pac-Man as Mokujin, cause that is kind of awesome.
6328480	6329480	That's Tetsujin.
6329480	6330480	Oh, I thought it was Mokujin.
6330480	6331480	It was the metal outfit.
6331480	6332480	Oh, okay.
6332480	6333480	Tetsujin means iron.
6333480	6334600	Ah, got it.
6334600	6338960	Now Moku would, now listen, I mean, now I can speak Japanese.
6338960	6340560	Domo Oregato, Mr. Roboto.
6340560	6343320	Hey, here's another, another lesson.
6343320	6346660	Moku Yobi is Wednesday.
6346660	6349320	No one curry.
6349320	6355320	I mean, I was just going to say that, uh, doesn't Capcom understand that these fucking
6355320	6357720	characters are not part of Street Fighter or Tekken?
6357720	6364240	I mean, I understand that they want to do like a SNK versus, you know, a Namco versus
6364240	6366440	Capcom game or something like that.
6366440	6370360	But there was a Namco cross Capcom game, but it wasn't a fighting game.
6370360	6374360	Why didn't they just do, you know, instead of Street Fighter cross Tekken, why don't
6374360	6377600	they just do Namco cross Capcom, the fighting game?
6377600	6378880	Cause that's what this is.
6378880	6380480	Like they had the fucking final fight characters.
6380480	6383160	They have Cole, which I'm that cool.
6383160	6385720	You got your exclusive characters for the PlayStation.
6385720	6387680	Cole isn't either one, but okay.
6387680	6388680	Whatever.
6388680	6391720	You know, and, and like Pac-Man stuff, it just doesn't make any sense.
6391720	6395720	And none for Xbox buy.
6395720	6399920	The only cool thing about this Pac-Man Pac-Man's adorable.
6399920	6403200	See right before you watch that trailer, you're like, what the fuck Pac-Man?
6403200	6405280	Like that's not going to make sense when you're watching it like, Oh, okay.
6405280	6406280	That's right.
6406280	6407280	Mega Man.
6407280	6408280	What'd they do to Mega Man?
6408280	6411340	That's like the exact same reaction the rest of the internet had.
6411340	6418720	He's like, not even, you know, kind of lean and mean looking, but he's, it looks like
6418720	6420440	he's been eating too many donuts.
6420440	6422520	He looks like Mega Man going through a midlife crisis.
6422520	6424720	It looks like I put on a Mega Man outfit.
6424720	6425720	No.
6425720	6427320	Rob, you would look better than that dude.
6427320	6428800	Oh, well thank you.
6428800	6429800	All right.
6429800	6430800	Next story.
6430800	6431800	Yes.
6431800	6434280	I know about some Doctor Who news.
6434280	6441760	There will be a two Doctor Who games that are going to be on the PC, PlayStation three
6441760	6450280	and actually there's, there were two, there is a Doctor Who, the eternity clock is going
6450280	6460000	to come out on March, 2012 and it is going to be a, well it has the silence and apparently
6460000	6463400	a bunch of the other bad guys who like the Daleks cause you can't have a Doctor Who game
6463400	6466780	without the Daleks being all over at exterminate.
6466780	6472120	So next news, um, we're not having a BlizzCon next year.
6472120	6473440	No BlizzCon.
6473440	6474720	As in this year?
6474720	6475720	This year.
6475720	6476720	Yeah.
6476720	6479560	That means that I won't be able to do disc on like I did last year.
6479560	6480840	Oh yeah.
6480840	6489680	No BlizzCon because apparently they are so busy with Diablo three and the pandas and
6489680	6495760	the Titan MMO who that they're just not going to do it or they just have nothing to show
6495760	6496760	us.
6496760	6497760	I mean, let's be real.
6497760	6498760	They have nothing to show us.
6498760	6499760	Everything.
6499760	6500760	We already know everything.
6500760	6504280	Titans not ready to show and you know, whatever the next next expansion is for a while.
6504280	6509560	They're not going to show this or little pandas, but they didn't have a BlizzCon in 2006 so
6509560	6512240	folks do need to realize it was never supposed to be an annual event.
6512240	6514080	It just kind of worked out that way.
6514080	6519720	All pandas I'm going to have you realize I have saved the name fatty cakes to make my
6519720	6520720	Panda.
6520720	6521720	I know.
6521720	6526160	What did I call my mud slapper after it was, you don't, we were playing around the, you
6526160	6531040	don't know Jack and I think it was, is it one of Baskin Robbins 31 flavors or is it
6531040	6536040	a term for a fart and mud slapper came up and I'm like, I'm going to name my pandar
6536040	6537040	in that.
6537040	6538040	I almost, that's a fart.
6538040	6544120	I almost did, um, named, named, uh, named her after my would name my Panda after my
6544120	6545120	current druid.
6545120	6546720	And they made her pond arena.
6546720	6547720	Nice.
6547720	6549400	All right.
6549400	6551000	That's it for rapid fire news.
6551000	6553240	I think we've been promising this for some time now.
6553240	6560680	I think it's time to get into tonight's list list.
6560680	6567240	Tonight's list list topic is what bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U Xbox lube
6567240	6569400	or PlayStation four.
6569400	6573080	This was inspired by a tweet that was sent to me earlier this week for message J one
6573080	6577280	hundred, Matt that said the next listless or match game should feature gaming bullshit
6577280	6582520	rumors because, uh, I was tweeting about the whole ridiculousness of some of the Xbox rumors
6582520	6586700	that were going around and he suggested that and I said, you know what, consider it done.
6586700	6587700	So here it is.
6587700	6592900	What bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U Xbox lube or PlayStation four.
6592900	6595800	If you have suggestions, you should yell them out in our chat room at chat, that orange
6595800	6599520	ready.com because when a host needs an answer, they might consult our chat room and pick
6599520	6600520	some of our favorites.
6600520	6601520	Okay.
6601520	6602520	The way to listless works.
6602520	6603800	I'll recap for you one time.
6603800	6607560	Four people are going to participate, so it's going to be us and Alan is in the room.
6607560	6608560	Hi Alan.
6608560	6609560	How you doing?
6609560	6610560	Good.
6610560	6611560	Yay.
6611560	6612560	Hi.
6612560	6613560	What's new.
6613560	6614560	Skyrim.
6614560	6615560	Okay.
6615560	6616560	All right.
6616560	6619280	So we're all going to go around and name our top three and then we each go around the room
6619280	6622280	and take one off of the list.
6622280	6624060	That leaves a list of eight.
6624060	6627500	You guys in our chat room, then vote on the list of eight to pick your number one and
6627500	6628500	number two favorites.
6628500	6633640	And then we have our definitive list of the top three bullshit rumors that will be next
6633640	6637720	about the Wii U Xbox lube or PlayStation four.
6637720	6638720	Okay.
6638720	6641320	All right.
6641320	6642320	So let's start it off.
6642320	6647440	Um, who wants to start off, uh, dark soccer is going to start up dark soccer in the air
6647440	6648500	like I was in school.
6648500	6654780	Your number three bullshit rumor headset will come out that will send a signal directly
6654780	6658360	to the brain through a small laser shot toward the optical nerve that will provide an immersive
6658360	6664080	environment at Andy fork effect, making them easily conquerable by our alien overlords.
6664080	6666840	So I'm going to shorten that to say board headset.
6666840	6677960	This the little thing from the Star Trek episode, the game, ah, what console will that be on?
6677960	6679920	It's Nintendo.
6679920	6680920	It'll be on the wheel.
6680920	6681920	All right.
6681920	6683920	That's a Sony thing.
6683920	6684920	Okay.
6684920	6685920	Controlling you.
6685920	6686920	That would be Sony.
6686920	6688440	It's always one step closer to the holodeck, right?
6688440	6689440	Yes.
6689440	6690440	One step closer to the holiday.
6690440	6691440	All right.
6691440	6692440	How about Loki?
6692440	6693440	Why don't you go next?
6693440	6694440	Loki?
6694440	6695440	What's your number three answer?
6695440	6698800	My number three answer will be that the Xbox lube, uh, to further its immersion with gamers
6698800	6704840	and stuff will fire, uh, different colored liquids at you, depending on the situation.
6704840	6712240	Black spray, sweat, pain.
6712240	6718640	So it will actually, it's going to be liquid vision and it will actually fire shit at you
6718640	6721880	and get your living room.
6721880	6729100	And when you're playing a sex game, it's iridescent and foamy and shows up really well under a
6729100	6730100	black light.
6730100	6731100	All right.
6731100	6732740	I'll go next.
6732740	6736120	My number three answer for next bullshit rumor.
6736120	6742800	The Xbox lube will introduce a new technology that is 100% hack proof.
6742800	6743800	Yay.
6743800	6746480	See what I did there?
6746480	6747800	I see what you did there.
6747800	6748800	All right.
6748800	6751680	So the Xbox lube will be a hundred percent hack proof.
6751680	6758680	It'd be funnier if it was a hundred percent hack proof by the fact that it's just a solid
6758680	6759680	steel block.
6759680	6767040	Like you have to cut through with like welding material, welding tools to get to the actual
6767040	6771640	like people, people put it on their entertainment centers and then the entertainment center
6771640	6774560	just collapses because it can't hold the weight.
6774560	6776760	It's like, ah, don't worry about it.
6776760	6779760	It's made out of a mystery material from space.
6779760	6780760	All right.
6780760	6785480	So, uh, Alan, what is your number three answer?
6785480	6791600	Microsoft purchases the mega video brand next Xbox cap streaming Netflix in 72 minutes as
6791600	6795680	DLC two for XBLA silver.
6795680	6797560	How am I supposed to shorten that way?
6797560	6799880	They're going to cap Netflix in 72 minutes.
6799880	6805520	Are you familiar with watching pirate stuff on mega video after 72 minutes, it would say,
6805520	6810800	we're sorry, you're, you know, you've watched too much, so you have to, and it would piss
6810800	6811800	people off.
6811800	6819360	So LOL, if the Xbox did that in some ways, that's funny.
6819360	6824600	That's trolling the pirates because it's like, LOL, you got a free movie and then trolled.
6824600	6825600	You don't get to see the ending.
6825600	6826600	That's kind of funny.
6826600	6829160	And what was the other half of that?
6829160	6833760	Also on for mega download, you have to enter a queue to actually download the episode you
6833760	6834760	want.
6834760	6836520	And sometimes it would be up to an hour or more.
6836520	6840920	So if you're an Xbox silver member, you'd have to wait to buy to get your DLC.
6840920	6841920	All right.
6841920	6842920	There you go.
6842920	6844040	Xbox taking some tips from mega video.
6844040	6848760	All right, let's go to Loki for his number two and I'm sorry, dark soccer was first.
6848760	6851440	I was going to say, please, I was doing things out of order.
6851440	6852440	Dark soccer.
6852440	6853440	Your number two answer, please.
6853440	6857080	The Wii U will actually have a camera and the controller that maps your face to your
6857080	6862840	me, but it secretly steals your soul and feeds it to Miyamoto.
6862840	6867780	They advertise it as having a webcam in it, but it steals your soul.
6867780	6870040	Now what will Miyamoto be doing with those souls?
6870040	6878880	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, using it to fuel his dark magical powers to make a new Zelda
6878880	6879880	game.
6879880	6880880	All right.
6880880	6884800	Loki, your number two, it'll be Zelda soul force.
6884800	6889360	Well, I was going to have it be like the Wii U as a VR headset, but that's kind of been
6889360	6890360	done before.
6890360	6892040	So the Wii U is the controller.
6892040	6894480	Like the actual console is the controller.
6894480	6899960	So you better make sure you don't throw it because that might be bad.
6899960	6905800	Wait, I put Wii U as a console as a controller.
6905800	6906800	Don't throw it.
6906800	6907800	Here we go.
6907800	6908800	It's gotta be funnier.
6908800	6909800	All right.
6909800	6910800	All right, fine.
6910800	6911800	Okay.
6911800	6914640	It's a, it is the controller, but it's shaped like a giant, like number one, you know, foam
6914640	6923560	glove because they're the number one console.
6923560	6930760	I like the idea of a big number one foam glove being the next controller.
6930760	6931760	All right.
6931760	6934840	They're trying to, you know, real in the sports lover demographic.
6934840	6936640	All right.
6936640	6943160	My number two answer is that the PlayStation four will actually let you beam yourself into
6943160	6946200	the grid so you can participate in Tron.
6946200	6951120	Like IRL reboot and the blind, the show reboot, right?
6951120	6953120	Is that what you're talking about?
6953120	6954120	That show?
6954120	6955120	What was that?
6955120	6956120	Incoming game.
6956120	6957120	It was a Saturday morning.
6957120	6958120	Part two.
6958120	6959800	It was one of the first police ever.
6959800	6960800	They had blue faces.
6960800	6961800	They were purple.
6961800	6964800	They were purple.
6964800	6968760	Hold on.
6968760	6969760	I'm typing this out.
6969760	6972440	PS four will actually let you beam yourself in the grid.
6972440	6973440	Okay.
6973440	6978640	I have a friend that's a really big fan of that show too.
6978640	6980440	How many years has that been off the show?
6980440	6981440	All right.
6981440	6986880	So Alan, your number two answer for next bullshit rumor.
6986880	6992480	Taking a hint from the PS two emotion engine, the PS four will have an empathy engine chip
6992480	7001800	that actually really does feel the same pain as you when it's $799 price point is revealed.
7001800	7002800	Womp womp.
7002800	7003800	All right.
7003800	7008480	So the PS four empathy engine actually will feel sorry for Sony when the price point is
7008480	7009480	revealed.
7009480	7011600	I don't like that PS four empathy engine.
7011600	7012600	All right.
7012600	7013600	Dark Sakura.
7013600	7016880	It's time for the number one answer is let me, let me recap just so we don't have any
7016880	7017880	double heads.
7017880	7018880	Let me recap.
7018880	7020120	Headset from the game for PS four.
7020120	7021120	I should put Star Trek.
7021120	7028640	The game headset from Star Trek, the game for PlayStation four fire different colored
7028640	7029640	liquids at you.
7029640	7039440	What console was that loop of the loop lubricating liquid and fires warming gel in your eye.
7039440	7041040	All right.
7041040	7043520	Xbox lube is a hundred percent hack group.
7043520	7047220	Xbox teams up with mega video, which brings caps for Netflix.
7047220	7050240	The Wii U will steal your soul and feed the Miyamoto.
7050240	7054440	We use the console is the controller and it comes with a big number one foam glove.
7054440	7059440	A PS four will actually let you beam yourself into the grid and the PlayStation four has
7059440	7060440	an empathy engine.
7060440	7064280	When you hear the $799 price point, it will cry.
7064280	7065280	All right.
7065280	7066280	Dark Sakura.
7066280	7073240	I'm going to laugh number one answer for next bullshit rumor for the lube.
7073240	7077000	Everyone will be issued a skin implant that has what games they've purchased registered
7077000	7083840	to their DNA.
7083840	7088400	That would be the only real way and most importantly, hack proof.
7088400	7092880	So when you actually go in to give blood samples, they'll be able to see what games you've purchased.
7092880	7096360	Ooh, someone's been playing X tango.
7096360	7097360	Okay.
7097360	7098360	Really?
7098360	7099360	You bought fusion frenzy.
7099360	7103280	All right, Loki number one answer.
7103280	7107480	The PlayStation four will be a co-produced by Capcom.
7107480	7113040	It will arrive in the shape of the bad box art mega man in the position of where he is
7113040	7120640	teabagging the consumer as a special thanks from Capcom for your wait, the console or
7120640	7121640	the box.
7121640	7125240	The actual console will be in the shape of bad box art mega man.
7125240	7132080	Think of it as a statue, if you will, uh, where he is teabagging the user PS four co-produced
7132080	7136120	by Capcom console is shaped as mega man teabag.
7136120	7138920	It's the ultimate insult or the ultimate troll.
7138920	7139920	I see.
7139920	7140920	I see it.
7140920	7141920	It's all been leading up to this.
7141920	7142920	Exactly.
7142920	7143920	All right.
7143920	7144920	It's a PlayStation exclusive.
7144920	7148640	You see my number one answer.
7148640	7158160	President cat is a launch title for the Wii U as a seller that might sell me the system.
7158160	7159480	Hey, it could happen.
7159480	7160480	All right.
7160480	7164000	Hey, an insider source told me they're thinking about it.
7164000	7167320	Alan, your number one answer.
7167320	7170120	My ideas kind of fell apart when it came to number three.
7170120	7172120	So this kind of really is good.
7172120	7178040	Um, the second gen three DS XL will also double as and work better than the we use controller
7178040	7185640	tablet from launch comes with a free step of coup blade for early adopters.
7185640	7190760	So basically the next three years will work with the Wii U and actually be better than
7190760	7195040	what comes with the new and you can fall on it when you realize how much you paid for
7195040	7196040	it.
7196040	7197040	Yeah.
7197040	7198040	Got it.
7198040	7199040	All right.
7199040	7200040	All right guys.
7200040	7201040	Here we go.
7201040	7202040	Let's see.
7202040	7203040	First I got to read off some of the answers from chat here.
7203040	7205960	I don't know if I see a tiger class says, how about the Wii U introduces a new peripheral
7205960	7210160	to let you control the dashboard or games, but only using your mind.
7210160	7215880	Uh, a hum, a hum Kara says Sony and Microsoft secretly joined forces to develop a console
7215880	7219160	to beat Nintendo since that's the only way that they could win the console battle in
7219160	7224640	Japan and the worldwide, uh, acidic vampire thinks that in dark soccer's answer about
7224640	7228200	Miyamoto taking the souls, they'll be transferred to the means.
7228200	7229760	Let's see.
7229760	7236240	Uh, tiger class says the Xbox introduces a perfect, oh wait, I already saw that one.
7236240	7238680	Um, so we said something about the only play MMOs.
7238680	7239680	There you go.
7239680	7242120	Some of the answers from our chat room.
7242120	7243120	All right.
7243120	7245120	But we, we, you want to change yours.
7245120	7246120	Yeah.
7246120	7247120	Get rid of my third one.
7247120	7249120	I have a new, I are at my first five, my final one.
7249120	7251120	I want to replace it.
7251120	7252120	Yes.
7252120	7258600	So it's rumored that the load up a splash screen for the Wii U is actually a memory
7258600	7274000	erasing pulse so that they can get you to buy a budget of Zelda and Mario.
7274000	7276880	So I have the Wii U loading screen erases your memory.
7276880	7278800	So you rebuy games all over again.
7278800	7279800	I like that.
7279800	7282320	Do I, do I own the super Mario three?
7282320	7283320	I can't remember.
7283320	7284960	Don't I have Mario three?
7284960	7286760	I love Mario three.
7286760	7287880	All right.
7287880	7290760	Now's the part where we go around and eliminate items from the list.
7290760	7292680	It's very difficult, but it has to be done.
7292680	7294000	All right.
7294000	7295840	Here's the list of stands so far.
7295840	7301240	Headset from Star Trek, the game for PS4, uh, Xbox lube fire different colored liquids
7301240	7302240	at you.
7302240	7304000	Xbox lube is a hundred percent hack proof.
7304000	7307040	Xbox teams up with mega video caps for Netflix.
7307040	7309800	Wii U will steal your soul and feed them to Miyamoto.
7309800	7313880	We use the console as a controller and it's just a big number one foam glove.
7313880	7317160	The PlayStation four will actually let you beam yourself into the grid.
7317160	7321960	PlayStation four has an empathy engine price of $799 fuel pain.
7321960	7326960	Xbox lube skin implant, which purchases registered to your DNA.
7326960	7331040	The PlayStation four is co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as Mega Man teabagging
7331040	7332040	you.
7332040	7336200	Uh, president cat has a launch title for the Wii U and the Wii U loading screen erases
7336200	7337200	your memory.
7337200	7339360	So you rebuy the games again.
7339360	7342640	Unfortunately, the list cannot stay in this shape.
7342640	7346120	We have to tinker with it a little bit and erase those that are unworthy.
7346120	7349240	Dark Sakura, which of these is unworthy of the list?
7349240	7352600	I have to go with the, um, liquid one.
7352600	7355520	Oh, that's just, that's one of my favorites.
7355520	7358960	The Xbox lube firing different colored liquids at you.
7358960	7362080	I would love that one, but it is off the list.
7362080	7363080	Sorry.
7363080	7364160	Chatters low key.
7364160	7365720	Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7365720	7366720	I take off.
7366720	7369920	It's a hundred percent hack proof because they will make that claim and unfortunately
7369920	7372920	it, you know, it's not going to be a hundred percent.
7372920	7373920	All right.
7373920	7377040	That is stricken from the list.
7377040	7385120	Um, I'm thinking, sorry, I don't mean to be quiet.
7385120	7390720	Um, I'm going to erase.
7390720	7392880	I'm going to erase.
7392880	7397320	I'm sorry, Jamie, the headset from Star Trek, the game for the PlayStation four, it went
7397320	7398320	over my head.
7398320	7399320	All right.
7399320	7402320	It is off the list.
7402320	7404960	Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7404960	7406960	Oh boy.
7406960	7420840	Um, looking, looking, the, uh, president cats, a launch title for the Wii U.
7420840	7426160	I think you just eliminated the one the entire chat would have voted for, but it is off the
7426160	7427160	list.
7427160	7428160	What?
7428160	7430160	That's probably the second or third time I've done that on this list.
7430160	7435560	I'm not rid of the popular fandom one, so I'm just keeping up with my shitty reputation.
7435560	7442200	All right, Alan keeps his shitty reputation by striking president cat as a launch title
7442200	7445060	for the Wii U hit is off the list.
7445060	7446060	So here it is.
7446060	7447060	Here's the list.
7447060	7450840	As you can vote for, please send your number one and your number two answers as a private
7450840	7455400	message to sky in the chat room, S K I E sky in the chat room.

7457320	7460320	Xbox teams up with mega video and there's caps for Netflix.
7460320	7463200	The Wii U will steal your soul and feed it to Miyamoto.
7463200	7467180	The Wii U where the console is the controller and it's a big number one foam glove.
7467180	7471840	The PS4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid from Tron PlayStation four empathy
7471840	7475760	engine that will feel the pain of a $799 price point.
7475760	7480040	Xbox lube has a skin implant with purchases registered to your DNA.
7480040	7484560	PlayStation four is co-produced by Capcom and the old school mega man will teabag you.
7484560	7488660	A Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you rebuy games.
7488660	7491240	There is the list as it stands now.
7491240	7496360	Place your number one and your number two votes in a private message to sky S K I E
7496360	7497620	in the chat with your vote.
7497620	7500960	We will tally them up and have the answers for you shortly.
7500960	7504960	In the meantime, let's go to more news from Loki.
7504960	7505960	Thank you, Alan.
7505960	7507320	You can stick around for results later.
7507320	7508320	Yeah.
7508320	7511900	Just, just tell chat the reason why I deleted the president cat one is because it was more
7511900	7514840	about a game than the console.
7514840	7517640	Justify, justify, justify.
7517640	7519800	All right.
7519800	7520800	No, it's fine.
7520800	7521800	All right.
7521800	7522800	Moving on.
7522800	7528680	Uh, there's a rumor that SNK may be releasing a new Neo Geo handheld system.
7528680	7534680	Uh, not necessarily a Neo Geo pocket, but it's currently known as the Neo Geo portable
7534680	7535680	device.
7535680	7540720	Um, and it's a handheld it's, they're saying it's slightly bigger than an iPhone.
7540720	7546800	It comes with two gigs of storage, uh, plenty of buttons, a 4.3 inch screen, SD card slot,
7546800	7548200	headphone jack, and AV out.
7548200	7551640	It sounds just like a dingo to be honest.
7551640	7553160	Looks just like a dingo.
7553160	7560560	Um, and, uh, they're saying, um, thanks to official SNK licensing, it comes preloaded
7560560	7566520	with 20 Neo Geo titles, um, North American versions, including metal slug, fatal fairy
7566520	7573680	specials, and Goku, uh, King of the monsters and a magician Lord, as well as many others.
7573680	7576160	I have magician Lord already.
7576160	7582560	And um, let's see, yeah, it sounds neat.
7582560	7591080	Of course, you know, this is coming from Famicom Plaza and, uh, SNK hasn't really, uh, confirmed
7591080	7595200	anything yet, but, uh, it looks neat.
7595200	7602720	We want interesting, as long as the games are cheaper, that's the most important thing.
7602720	7603720	Oh yeah.
7603720	7604720	All right.
7604720	7608080	Moving on with some other, uh, little Nintendo updates going on.
7608080	7613880	Uh, Nintendo has apparently, um, I guess they're, they're really experiencing some heavy losses
7613880	7617840	and it's even funny because the story's so much out there that that one, what is that
7617840	7621380	Asian company that does all the animations that end up on like Conan O'Brien and stuff
7621380	7622380	of the news NME?
7622380	7623380	Is that their name?
7623380	7625360	I can't remember NMA or something.
7625360	7626360	Yeah.
7626360	7630040	Um, they actually did a video on this whole, like Nintendo's losing money thing, but the
7630040	7634560	interesting kind of silver lining to this is that apparently 15 million 3DS units have
7634560	7635720	been sold since the launch.
7635720	7639800	So 3DS has really recovered in many ways, which I seem to remember saying on this show
7639800	7645160	would happen around Christmas, but anyway, um, here's the thing though, uh, Nintendo
7645160	7651440	did basically switch their forecast around from a $20 billion profit to an actual loss.
7651440	7656760	Hey, Nintendo had sales of 7.2 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal year.
7656760	7658760	And that was a 31% decrease.
7658760	7662960	And their overall loss was 48.4 billion yen.
7662960	7668600	That's $620 million, um, quote Nintendo 3DS hardware during the nine months ended December
7668600	7672020	31st, 2011 were 11.4, 3 million units.
7672020	7675780	And the total worldwide sales since its launch exceeded 15 million units.
7675780	7679960	That's in the official press release from the company, uh, Mario 3D land and Mario Kart
7679960	7681560	7 are million selling titles.
7681560	7685040	I want to say I've heard they're up to like 5 million actually at this point.
7685040	7690960	So, um, apparently some of these financial woes are making people think maybe they should
7690960	7692440	get into more mobile gaming.
7692440	7697120	There's that whole talk again, maybe Nintendo should put something out on iOS, but I highly
7697120	7698800	doubt that will ever happen.
7698800	7702140	Their stock by the way, is currently at a five year low.
7702140	7706320	So they have a lot riding on them for this E3, in my opinion, um, they're going to have
7706320	7707580	to impress.
7707580	7713320	If they don't impress, impress at this year's E3, it's going to be very bad.
7713320	7714320	Very bad.
7714320	7719920	All right, moving on, Dark Sakura is going to open up the email bag and read some emails
7719920	7724560	for us.
7724560	7728760	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and Dark Sakura
7728760	7733880	dives into the email bag and reads some of those emails here on air.
7733880	7738660	I would be able to read them if they would actually go to the email because my computer
7738660	7741240	has decided to be a bitch.
7741240	7743240	Okay, there we go.
7743240	7744960	This is from blade three.
7744960	7748640	I was interested in your setup a couple of weeks ago because I have a couple of handheld
7748640	7754160	dynamics that are studio grade that I would like to donate to the show.
7754160	7758600	I don't have any spare XLR cables unfortunately, but I believe you are likely already using
7758600	7759600	them.
7759600	7762200	So if you guys could contact me back, whatever, we can work it out.
7762200	7763200	Thanks guys.
7763200	7764200	Fantastic work.
7764200	7765200	PS.
7765200	7766200	My grammar sucks lol.
7766200	7767200	Raffle party limafo.
7767200	7768200	Heart.
7768200	7771160	You don't give everyone a hard time.
7771160	7772160	Heck yeah.
7772160	7773160	I'll take donations.
7773160	7774680	We could actually, actually we do need one mic right now.
7774680	7776560	We could, and actually we could really use two.
7776560	7778240	So um, heck yeah.
7778240	7779840	And we have plenty of cables.
7779840	7783560	Um, so yes, I should have responded to that offline.
7783560	7784560	Sorry.
7784560	7787240	I should have taken that out of the mailbag, but yes, we want it.
7787240	7788960	Now everybody knows our business.
7788960	7796240	Well, we first had, um, an email from Rubba Bubba that said, um, I looked around for sites
7796240	7798040	blacking out today, January 18th.
7798040	7799640	I'm very disappointed.
7799640	7803120	Sites, um, that could bring a lot more force to the event are not participating.
7803120	7806720	Google censored their own logo, but I think being blacked out would be more effective.
7806720	7810360	The only one of my favorite sites that is down is game politics.
7810360	7813720	Your site was also down when I checked, but something tells me that wasn't on purpose.
7813720	7814720	Yes it was.
7814720	7817240	Now we took it down on purpose.
7817240	7818320	There should have been a message there.
7818320	7819320	Now there's a PS.
7819320	7820320	Okay.
7820320	7821320	Sorry.
7821320	7824600	Almost immediately after writing the email below, senators and reps are dropping their
7824600	7826640	support from SOPA and PIPA.
7826640	7831600	Even the sponsors of the bills, the MPAA, then responded in the most ironic way, accusing
7831600	7835300	sites like Reddit and Wikipedia of trying to make Congress into their corporate puppets
7835300	7838560	to further their financial empire.
7838560	7840600	That is ironic and stupid.
7840600	7843800	Also the Google protest seems to have caught some attention for linking their censorship
7843800	7847560	logo directly to a petition with a very cool infographic.
7847560	7851520	My own opinion is that piracy is already wrong and we have the legal system in place to address
7851520	7853080	that via due process.
7853080	7858320	Well, look what happened to that mega video, although, you know, it did take a while, but
7858320	7863080	that guy's, you know, and a lot of his people are in jail now and not getting out anytime
7863080	7864080	soon.
7864080	7866860	By the way, did you know, did you know that that same guy was like the number one call
7866860	7869520	of duty modern warfare three player like in the world?
7869520	7870520	He cheated.
7870520	7871520	Did he?
7871520	7872520	Yeah.
7872520	7873520	How'd he do it?
7873520	7875720	Uh, there's ways.
7875720	7876720	You don't want to share.
7876720	7877720	Okay.
7877720	7878720	No, I just, I don't play quality tomorrow.
7878720	7879720	Warfare three.
7879720	7885440	I mean, if it's, I'm assuming it's very much like, uh, uh, you know, the other ones.
7885440	7890360	It is ironic though that he's getting more time in jail than some rapists and killers,
7890360	7894080	but you know, welcome to America.
7894080	7898600	Apparently he used to play like quake and stuff like that and rude rage quit and stuff.
7898600	7901160	And I don't know, whatever.
7901160	7902160	I don't know.
7902160	7906760	I can't really speak for, you know, playing him, so I don't know.
7906760	7908280	Well, we have one last email.
7908280	7916760	Oh, and by the way, people who, uh, um, sent me the, uh, master system things, I am, I've
7916760	7919560	got two of you already and I'm going to be sending those out.
7919560	7920560	Just let you know.
7920560	7921560	Haven't forgotten.
7921560	7923560	Um, I just have to get paid.
7923560	7928040	Hey, OLR crew, happy new year and congratulations on the move to the new studio.
7928040	7932160	The show sounds great and it's good to hear Alan is a regular contributor now, although
7932160	7935880	I have to express my endless, oops, sorry.
7935880	7939760	The Twitter music started playing my endless sorrow at the retirement of Shermy.
7939760	7941440	Shermy is not sorrowful.
7941440	7947200	She has her own room that smells like her butt, except I cleaned.
7947200	7948200	It's also the laundry room.
7948200	7949200	I cleaned it.
7949200	7950200	But you know what?
7950200	7951200	She's happy.
7951200	7954120	That room gets warm every time we dry the clothes.
7954120	7960240	Sometimes a warm towel gets dropped on her as a blanket and she's a very happy girl for
7960240	7961240	happy girl.
7961240	7962240	Well, keep in mind guys.
7962240	7963240	I love Shermy too.
7963240	7964680	You have to remember, I love Shermy too.
7964680	7968720	She's a great cat, but we, we do have kitties in the new OLR studio.
7968720	7970840	It's just that they're not as friendly.
7970840	7975560	Well, they're, they're pretty friendly, but they're just, they're, they're shy.
7975560	7976560	So they run out of the room.
7976560	7980360	They don't want to be in here cause they, they hide, they don't recognize Loki and they
7980360	7983240	should recognize our soccer, but for whatever reason they pretend they don't and they run
7983240	7984240	out of the room.
7984240	7985800	So, but here's the thing.
7985800	7991520	If you're my 3DS friend, I send out pictures of the cats in 3D all the time on swap note.
7991520	7997200	So just ask Tiger Claw or Jason if he's listening tonight or Shane I think is in chat.
7997200	8000920	A few of you are on my Facebook and I put pictures up on Facebook.
8000920	8001920	Yeah.
8001920	8005520	Especially Marco walking around with that tail in the air.
8005520	8006520	Look at me.
8006520	8007520	My tail's in the air.
8007520	8009520	Look at my butt.
8009520	8010520	I love Marco.
8010520	8011520	Such a sweetie.
8011520	8015680	Sanrio is very, very, she's, she's a cute little old lady, but she gives me the stink
8015680	8016680	eye sometimes.
8016680	8017680	Yeah.
8017680	8018680	Cause you're another girl.
8018680	8019680	I know.
8019680	8025720	So I have two disparate top topics I was hoping that Rob, Jamie and Loki could weigh in on.
8025720	8026720	No.
8026720	8029080	The first being the announcement of Resident Evil 6.
8029080	8031040	Are any of you excited by this news?
8031040	8032040	Not really.
8032040	8034900	Um, I don't play the Resident Evil series, so no.
8034900	8036140	I got out of this.
8036140	8041280	I got out of the series some time ago, although I did dabble in Resident Evil 4, which was
8041280	8042280	pretty darn good.
8042280	8044740	And I really should have committed more time to the game.
8044740	8051840	And then Resident Evil 5 was like, from what I hear, Resident Evil 6 is a little more like
8051840	8055040	four than it was like five, which is probably a very good thing.
8055040	8062480	So I'm, what I want to know is why does the logo look like a chick blowing a giraffe?
8062480	8065000	Have you looked at the logo?
8065000	8067200	Wait, let me, let me put it here in chat here.
8067200	8071600	Well, while you do that, I'm going to finish reading the part of the email.
8071600	8072960	Are you excited by the news?
8072960	8078080	I am personally having a bit of a fan-gasm, seeing them bring back Leon, Ashley, and Hunnigan,
8078080	8083780	as I am a huge Resident Evil 4 fan, but have been playing all the games since day one.
8083780	8085880	It does kind of look like giraffe.
8085880	8086880	See?
8086880	8087880	It's just blowing!
8087880	8090520	It's a chick blowing a giraffe!
8090520	8091520	Cannot unsee.
8091520	8093320	Yes, now you won't be able to unsee it.
8093320	8095320	There it is.
8095320	8100120	Oh, Jeffrey, what have you gotten yourself into?
8100120	8101920	That's what happened to the Toys R Us mascot.
8101920	8102920	I haven't seen him in forever.
8102920	8107280	I'm glad he found work on Resident Evil porn.
8107280	8109880	Speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.
8109880	8114200	And by the way, the last one that I actually played was, uh, that I really actually last
8114200	8116960	played was Gun Survivor.
8116960	8119920	The one that was like Code Veronica, Gun Survivor 2.
8119920	8120920	Oh, okay.
8120920	8121920	In the arcade.
8121920	8124240	That was the last one I actually played myself.
8124240	8126960	So speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.
8126960	8129400	Have any of you downloaded the Revelations demo for 3DS?
8129400	8130800	No, because I don't have one.
8130800	8132800	Why yes, I have.
8132800	8134240	Would you like to play a Dark Sakura?
8134240	8135240	It's right there.
8135240	8137000	I have 28 uses left.
8137000	8138000	Maybe in a bit.
8138000	8139000	All right.
8139000	8142900	I was particularly impressed by the graphical potential the 3DS is beginning to show.
8142900	8146760	With the Vita coming out next month and games for dedicated portable systems trending toward
8146760	8152760	console level graphics, do any of you feel that at some point the two will intersect?
8152760	8156780	Well, haven't handheld's always kind of felt like they're just a generation behind.
8156780	8157780	I mean look at the DS.
8157780	8160480	The DS is a lot like a Nintendo 64.
8160480	8163400	Like the 1DS was a bunch of ports in Nintendo 64 stuff.
8163400	8165880	The Game Boy Advance was a bunch of ports and Super Nintendo stuff.
8165880	8166880	The original Game Boy.
8166880	8182060	And I kind of like just having it kind of with the Great
8182060	8186380	Gameboy especially the color had a lot of NES stuff on it so they're always
8186380	8192300	kind of you know just a generation behind so I I think I don't know about
8192300	8195380	the Vita so much I wouldn't say that the Vita is gonna have the potential to play
8195380	8200500	like PlayStation 3 stuff although it's supposed to be PlayStation 3 quality
8200500	8203740	graphics yeah because it because a smaller resolution so yeah that's kind
8203740	8206980	of what I'm talking out here is that because of the smaller resolution you
8206980	8211940	know your TV when you say 1080p that's 1080 pixels right but the amount that's
8211940	8217040	on the Vita is less so you can still render high-definition images but just a
8217040	8222460	lower resolution because it's a smaller picture so he's gonna look really good
8222460	8226900	but I especially don't know about direct ports I'm more excited about this whole
8226900	8230140	thing we were talking about earlier with the whole Vita possibly connecting to
8230140	8235820	your ps3 if you know with with be it hacks or whatever all I'm waiting for is
8235820	8240980	Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Vita so well there's a little bit more I wonder if at
8240980	8244700	some point one market might cannibalize the other while I'm personally thrilled
8244700	8249620	by the prospect of having ps3 slash 360 quality games on the go it seems only
8249620	8253340	logical to assume that at some point these systems will function as portable
8253340	8257220	consoles right oh that was really the point he was getting out with that okay
8257220	8261020	I get it now why not just wirelessly stream the content from the portable
8261020	8264980	system to the TV in your living room if you want a console style experience and
8264980	8269260	slip it into your pocket when you don't I understand that the Wii U is trying to
8269260	8272600	walk the fine line between those two entities but it honestly seems like a
8272600	8277260	letdown if the remote only works when you were in Wi-Fi range your thoughts
8277260	8282460	okay I get it so okay the rest email really kind of fills that in so the iPad
8282460	8290020	too what about it it does just that you can stream content from the iPad to your
8290020	8294820	Apple TV to your TV I get what he's saying though is that if if the power of
8294820	8299540	what is taking up all the space in my living room is in my pocket then why do
8299540	8304260	I need a console but keep in mind that's why console developers are kind of start
8304260	8306820	I think console developers kind of see this too and I think that's why you're
8306820	8311940	starting to see things that won't fit in your pocket like connect you know all
8311940	8315860	these streaming devices that you know will go to your home theater sound
8315860	8319380	system and so forth and these systems becoming more of like entertainment hubs
8319380	8325700	but I don't know like for me I don't like playing handheld games all the time
8325700	8331100	sometimes I want that gigantic you know 34 inch or however big our TV is picture
8331100	8335100	you know like I would want to play a game like Final Fantasy 13 2 on my
8335100	8339580	little DS in bed you know I want to maybe sometimes it would be cool like
8339580	8342180	once in a while for the mundane stuff but the big cutscenes and things like
8342180	8347940	that I want to see on the hi-def TV you know I don't know I I don't know if one's
8347940	8351340	necessarily gonna cannibalize the other but it's a very interesting point that
8351340	8356060	you're making and it's kind of neat that now the the consoles are kind of doing
8356060	8361220	things that the the TVs are having a hard time like 3d the TVs haven't all
8361220	8365180	been able to adopt that across the board yet now here we have the 3ds so it's
8365180	8368300	interesting um a lot of ports then you're gonna continue to see a lot of
8368300	8372260	ports like the same stuff coming out on the ps3 you're gonna see on the Vita and
8372260	8379820	the 3ds be interesting yes to conclude yes your loyal olr fanboy tonic vision
8379820	8385380	who I would love to commend on fantastic grammar and spelling gold star emailer
8385380	8391460	of the week yep you win the no prize I kai judo in our chat room says my
8391460	8394780	thoughts is this person plays way too many video games why would you want to
8394780	8399740	walk around with a PlayStation 3 well I seem to hey I have a nomad didn't do
8399740	8403620	well that and didn't they used to have that little like tiny screen that you
8403620	8407580	could plug into the back of a PlayStation one yes make it like it was
8407580	8411580	an actual thing play it in the car yeah I see you like play in the car and and
8411580	8418280	didn't somebody in this room make one for an Xbox yeah that had Xbox blew up
8418280	8424860	by the way like literally put pow yes well it's sort of Wow less less lesser
8424860	8428540	extent I was trying to I was trying to take it because that Xbox case is
8428540	8432540	falling apart and so I was trying to put it in the traditional case and the drive
8432540	8435740	that was in there where the motherboard that was in there there's something
8435740	8442500	wrong with the power supplies or something and hooked up pop and blew
8442500	8448500	something so yeah whatever for the record I have a nomad and I have a turbo
8448500	8454500	Express which with a TV tuner you could hook up your turbo Express to the to the
8454500	8458220	TV and then you could just take the turbo Express with you and with your
8458220	8462420	Hugh hearts I really like this comment from bocce kawa and chat and I think
8462420	8465860	this really gives you something to think about on the topics let me read it again
8465860	8469860	from bocce kawa at chat orange on twitter.com handheld games are different
8469860	8474380	to me if I were to pull out Street Fighter on break at work I wouldn't stop
8474380	8480380	but playing Pokemon at work is quick and easy that's a very interesting point is
8480380	8483860	think about the types of games that are being made on these systems what is
8483860	8486780	easier to play on the go and I think I was mentioning this before it might have
8486780	8489620	been on Bobby show we were doing the call at the end of the Bobby Black Wolf
8489620	8493500	show as we do every week but I was talking about how tiny tower makes a
8493500	8497020	great iOS game because you can play it for 30 seconds or whatever and then
8497020	8502140	you're done like it would be a terrible game to play on PlayStation 3 or
8502140	8505860	something like that like it just kind of works on iOS and a lot of the stuff that
8505860	8509940	they kind of try to force on iOS like ports of games like Mega Man 2 or the
8509940	8513980	Capcom arcade where you can play Street Fighter 2 on the iPhone that's it's it
8513980	8517820	sucks you can't control it the touch screen thing doesn't work it's it's
8517820	8523820	terrible so sometimes it is designing about really the right game to go with
8523820	8532460	the system very interesting all right is that it for emails tonight that would be
8532460	8538700	it no more emails sad face all right well I think it's about time for the F
8538700	8543660	use of the week this is the part of the show where we get angsty
8543660	8567700	if you to the day I've had and not having a tablet
8567700	8573060	Loki fuck you for the FBI going after mega upload because I actually did have
8573060	8577780	files they use on there and I also had a paid subscription thankfully wasn't that
8577780	8583700	long okay it's description but it's annoying because I lost a lot of my
8583700	8590100	files that's more piracy related at all so yeah that sucks and besides yeah
8590100	8593300	taking out mega upload really that stopped all the piracy it's all gone
8593300	8599140	there's not like file sharing sites everywhere else oh yeah you lot of good
8599140	8603620	job a lot of those file share sites block the u.s. which I thought was
8603620	8608220	interesting yeah that's I can get you can get around that shit I'm sure you
8608220	8615460	can't same way you do it in China all right um my F you the week I don't know
8615460	8621700	I don't really want too many details about it but F you to uncertainty we'll
8621700	8628060	leave it at that all right uh let's go and do the listless results from angry
8628060	8637060	to happy listless results here it is as you guys voted the top three to sit
8637060	8641420	definitive list these are the rumors that are coming next on the or they're
8641420	8648540	not not true number three answer for the next bullshit rumor about the Wii U the
8648540	8653820	Xbox lube or the PlayStation 4 number three answer the PlayStation 4 is
8653820	8658380	co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as a Mega Man teabagging you
8658380	8666420	excellent the number two answer the Wii U will steal your soul and beat it to
8666420	8674140	Miyamoto yeah and lastly the number one answer the thing this is it is the next
8674140	8680420	rumor and it's a thing the Wii U where the console is the controller because
8680420	8686380	it's a big number one foamy glove there it is how appropriate that number one is
8686380	8691820	number one ah Alan the chatters rejected both your and I answers all the way
8691820	8696540	because I ruin their fun I pick what they like and then I get rid of it
8696540	8701900	everybody it's Alan the destroyer of dreams I swear I don't do it on purpose
8701900	8705540	it's usually after the fact I'm like oh shit but then it's like I don't give a
8705540	8708620	fuck either so well since you're here is there anything you want to plug real
8708620	8714860	quick not really anything you've been playing you want a shout out Skyrim more
8714860	8721980	Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim yes and I cheat I cheat for gold and I'm not sorry did you
8721980	8731100	take an arrow to the knee yes get out all right all right there it is your
8731100	8734140	list list for tonight just a few more news stories for you guys and then the
8734140	8738620	Twitter topics and your calls at one eight seven seven game olr not just yet
8738620	8743100	we have some more stories for you guys Loki let's talk a little bit about
8743100	8747860	Resident Evil 6 again other than the fact that the logo sort of looks like
8747860	8757360	giraffe lacio giraffe lacio it rolls off the tongue is that censored on Xbox
8757360	8765700	giraffe lacio anyways so apparently it's the largest scale game ever made for
8765700	8773100	Capcom it has 600 people involved and should be pretty expensive by that you
8773100	8778020	know but it sounds like that apparently to put the numbers in the perspective
8778020	8786980	Assassin's Creed 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 were completed by 450 people and well
8786980	8793220	450 for Assassin's Creed 2 1000 for Grand Theft Auto 4 so be pretty
8793220	8800140	significant of course it can also be very buggy who knows you ever heard this
8800140	8806740	phrase too many cooks in the kitchen mm-hmm I want to know how on earth that
8806740	8811460	Resident Evil box art got out it's like nobody looked at the work that the
8811460	8817740	designer did the designer screwed it all up I was trying to get a reaction I'm
8817740	8822940	not getting anything she's just not paying attention to me I'm sorry what I
8822940	8828060	said for Resident Evil resolutions I'm surprised that that got out no well I'm
8828060	8831020	talking about the box art for isn't even you said resident evil in my brain just
8831020	8835660	went easy Resident Evil revelations that box art went out with a misspelling and
8835660	8839260	I was surprised how that happened and got out I said the designer didn't check
8839260	8844220	their work is all the designers fault and the design no blame no I'll tell you
8844220	8849620	what happened okay well yeah first of all the designer made a typo the
8849620	8855380	designer should have caught that but also QA should have caught that
8855380	8861140	marketing should have caught that distribution should have caught that
8861140	8868940	the end anyhow sorry I didn't mean to derail from Resident Evil 6 but I'm
8868940	8875820	sure it'll be great even if the logo looks like your a fella show hey steam
8875820	8881820	has a new iOS client it's in beta right now but I found that it's actually
8881820	8885660	pretty easy well I don't know maybe I'm just lucky but I tried to log into the
8885660	8889060	steam iOS app and it said sorry you're not in the beta and I'm like well boo
8889060	8892740	you whore and I shut it off but then the next day I was like well I wonder if I'm
8892740	8896060	in the beta yet I don't have an email but I'm just gonna try it anyway and
8896060	8901060	sure enough it let me right in so I'm able to get into the steam beta app and
8901060	8904900	here's what it basically lets you do is is basically sorry you're not gonna be
8904900	8908900	able to like suddenly play Arkham City on your iPhone it doesn't do that okay
8908900	8912060	you don't actually get to play the games but it's a front end for the store you
8912060	8915060	can see the stores you can see the sales you could actually of course they want
8915060	8918300	you to be able to spend your money right there from the you know wallet there's
8918300	8922180	buy some games but here's something else that's interesting is that you can use
8922180	8927220	the chat from steam from your phone and I actually was doing that a little bit
8927220	8931340	like I was on my phone in the other room and I started sending messages to Alan
8931340	8935620	while he was playing Skyrim I was like lol ghost I'm not there to be doing this
8935620	8939340	and so he figured out that I must have got into the iOS app but the chat
8939340	8942420	functionality is pretty cool at least so and you can see what your friends are
8942420	8945420	playing and I guess you can still look at things like screenshots and videos
8945420	8948820	all on the go so the good news about that is is that like if you have this
8948820	8954420	awesome Skyrim bug that you got a video of you could get out your iPhone you
8954420	8957580	know and say hey look at what happened to me in Skyrim dude and play it and
8957580	8961660	then you know it's right there so that's kind of cool I bet it's a matter of time
8961660	8964580	before maybe we start seeing some games so I don't know if it'll be like the
8964580	8970340	same games you see on but well I guess maybe that can't happen because Apple's
8970340	8973140	got to have control over all that and they're not gonna exactly let steam just
8973140	8977580	waltz right in and do that so I guess that is kind of a dumb train of thought
8977580	8983660	I'm going down but regardless it is neat that the chat is all integrated and you
8983660	8988180	know what they can kind of tie together is and who knows what might come in the
8988180	8993860	future who knows all right and dark soccer is trying to get into the app
8993860	8997580	right yeah maybe I should check and see if they let me in yet you never know
8997580	9005820	all right moving on dark soccer me oh yeah that's right me how about pixel
9005820	9012460	junk Eden guess where it's gonna be sting as in Thursday this week February
9012460	9020700	2nd we will have pixel jump Eden come from coming to a PC on Steam so you can
9020700	9026260	get it for $9.99 it's the full game and the encore DLC and you can get the
9026260	9034220	soundtrack separately for six whole dollars ooh six dollars that's a bargain
9034220	9038860	at half the price I'll wait for the it is a bargain at half the price I'll wait
9038860	9044100	for the fourth of July sale when it's gonna be 75 cents I know right no pixel
9044100	9047860	junk are pretty good games so you know and six dollars which I found one of the
9047860	9053940	pixel junk games for PSP at RC Willie for five bucks what is RC Willie it's
9053940	9059140	like a big lot no it's a huge expensive furniture store and they have
9059140	9062220	electronics except they're owned by Mormon so they're closed on Sunday
9062220	9066700	that's weird well not the Mormon part but the part about the whole like PSP
9066700	9071620	games got weird all right a couple more news stories for you guys and then the
9071620	9078580	skype line Loki all right and see the last thing we're gonna talk about here
9078580	9086340	well last thing I want to talk about is I can online passes and especially it's
9086340	9090300	not so bad that you know you have like an online pass for a game that has
9090300	9095300	online content but to call it an online pass for a game that does not have
9095300	9099620	online content is kind of idiotic but that's what they did with kingdoms of
9099620	9105300	Amalur reckoning they have an online pass for the game that will basically
9105300	9112020	unlock this house of valor faction quest line which they came out afterwards
9112020	9115540	because everyone's going well you know what the fuck you know why I have to I
9115540	9120300	could actually you know buy this game knew they have you know the actual quest
9120300	9123940	line for the game you know doesn't make any sense they're saying that you know
9123940	9130260	we always wanted to put this game or this content out as free bonus content
9130260	9135140	like free download content that would come later on or something like that but
9135140	9138860	now it's being you know part of the only past and they were defending that you
9138860	9143500	know well you know we need to do this because you know fit you generates more
9143500	9147220	sales and blah blah anyways I don't know I just stopped paying attention when
9147220	9153020	they're calling it online pass for a non online game what they really should have
9153020	9162620	done is just put out you know put bonus DLC with your you know first run games I
9162620	9165940	mean that's honestly would just be a different way of phrasing the same thing
9165940	9169740	it'd be yes and people will not get pissed off they'd be like you get this
9169740	9173460	bonus I mean no one's gonna complain oh hey guess what you know what we're
9173460	9178220	gonna give the people that buy the new game our first content pack of DLC for
9178220	9182900	free everyone to be like fuck yeah that's awesome thank you for rewarding
9182900	9186500	you know people for buying it new but then you're saying you know instead that
9186500	9191340	oh it's just you know it's an online you're making people feel like you're
9191340	9194220	giving him something as opposed to taking something away exactly that's
9194220	9203020	what it is yeah but all boils down to yeah so and in 38 studios your community
9203020	9212580	manager muse needs a fucking learn what you never never ever ever fucking say
9212580	9217380	that the content was once on the disc even if it was on the disc you never
9217380	9221500	fucking admit to that because then it is that this is that the same guy that's
9221500	9224660	like the guy behind it who was like a big baseball player back in the day well
9224660	9227940	Kurt Schilling is actually the head of the company 38 studio and isn't he the
9227940	9231980	same guy that's posting online no this is their community manager okay but yeah
9231980	9236820	he posted online some follow-up to but no he said you know so we wanted to post
9236820	9240300	a quick clarification for something that we've seen a few comments on for what
9240300	9246060	it's worth the House of Valor content was not in the finished game disc at one
9246060	9249900	point and then removed okay so it sounded like before that it was part of
9249900	9253420	the finished game this but it's not that they're saying that it isn't it's
9253420	9256980	nothing that we're locking you out of it was supposed to be standalone download
9256980	9260620	content okay well that's great so it was the situation where it's gonna be free
9260620	9263460	download content later on but don't fucking call an online pass because it
9263460	9268540	still implies that you're taking some away I mean I understand that EA calls
9268540	9273940	their passes online passes but just call it like a voucher for free DLC cuz it's
9273940	9277700	people won't get as pissed off about that I've heard the demos pretty
9277700	9282140	dreadful like just because it's so buggy and like they've actually apologized to
9282140	9286460	the demo and all this and it's kind of like dude why would you I mean I I'm so
9286460	9291260	shocked that companies allow this to happen like how did that happen if if
9291260	9295420	people up at the top are so upset and like I can't believe that we put out a
9295420	9299460	product like that like oh my god why would I be give you give you $60 of my
9299460	9304260	money to trust that I'm gonna get a good time this is what I've you know said
9304260	9308940	about download passes and stuff like that even though you're not getting this
9308940	9313700	extra quest line who gives a fuck I mean seriously we're talking like a bonus
9313700	9319380	quest DLC thing that you may or if it was you free yeah you probably downloaded
9319380	9322500	if it was paid if you don't like the game you're probably not gonna buy it
9322500	9328060	and I don't think you know something like this you should really pay $60 for
9328060	9332040	a way I mean it sounded like a cool game you know the character artworks done by
9332040	9338140	you know Tom McFarland which you know that's pretty awesome but it's just I
9338140	9340840	heard some positive things about it though some people say it's it is the
9340840	9345620	game that everybody thought fable would be yeah I mean it looks cool and and I
9345620	9349240	hate to see like games that kind of try something a little bit different you
9349240	9353100	know sorry was it supposed to be like multiplayer MMO at some point I don't
9353100	9355540	think so I thought it was like there was supposed to be some type of like
9355540	9362260	multi-person element in it that went away but I mean I don't know don't let
9362260	9367660	it the fact that you know this online passes in there because I'd say for like
9367660	9370780	a game like battlefield or something like that where you can't access online
9370780	9376180	portion you know demoing it out used without paying for the online pass that
9376180	9379500	is kind of crippling because you can miss a whole portion of the game that
9379500	9384700	it's kind of integral I mean people play battlefield 3 for their the online
9384700	9389300	portion of it but but oh you know if you don't buy those new copies and the
9389300	9398020	servers don't run yeah that makes no sense but I don't know it's whatever it
9398020	9404260	is what it is buy it or don't all right lastly for you guys tonight I don't know
9404260	9407980	as a resident here the state of California this this just pisses me off
9407980	9412020	but California has agreed that they're gonna reimburse the Entertainment
9412020	9416580	Software Association just shy of 1 million dollars that's nine hundred and
9416580	9422380	fifty thousand dollars in legal fees for bright fighting Brown versus the EMA up
9422380	9427940	to the Supreme Court let's see that the state negotiated that down from the
9427940	9433900	1.1 million Wow now there was already reimbursements previously for the case
9433900	9439660	in 2008 this means that California has paid out in total 1.3 million dollars to
9439660	9445780	the ESA yeah they're raising our tuition it and I quote Senator Yee and Governor
9445780	9449300	Schwarzenegger wasted more than 1 million dollars in taxpayer funds at a
9449300	9453900	time when Californians could ill afford it says Mike Gallagher who is the
9453900	9457740	president of the ESA however we feel strongly that some of these funds should
9457740	9461220	be used to improve services for California's youth so the ESA is just
9461220	9466220	kind of like rubbing it in basically now the ESA did say they will donate a
9466220	9469940	portion of the proceeds from the reimbursement to quote develop
9469940	9474500	after-school educational programs for under underserved communities in Oakland
9474500	9480460	and Sacramento hey our backyard this new education initiative will be start in
9480460	9484420	the spring and quote harness young people's natural passion for playing and
9484420	9488700	making video games and connecting them to the development of critical 21st
9488700	9493140	century job skills well while that's all nice and good that the ESA is pouring
9493140	9498620	some of that money back into you know the community I'm a realist and I know
9498620	9501880	certainly not all of it is going back into the community and that's my fucking
9501880	9506940	tax dollars like that just went to the ESA which if I remember right is now an
9506940	9509800	organization that was supporting SOPA and PIPA and all this stuff and it's
9509800	9513460	like I don't want my money they're going to draw me for this stuff okay fair
9513460	9519140	enough they did withdraw but I still feel like in some indirect way I paid to
9519140	9523420	help lobby for SOPA and PIPA for a short time and that kind of irritates me you
9523420	9528860	know I'm just I'm I I'm really irritated and I and Senator Yee will not kind of
9528860	9533180	give up this fight and I feel like he needs to be removed from office by vote
9533180	9536380	now sadly I don't live in a place that gets to vote for him or against him but
9536380	9542620	I mean sorry he needs to go he wasted that money and so did the governor but
9542620	9549060	the governor's already gone thank God that was just a joke I look I realize
9549060	9552460	they're not a political show and people get very very passionate and personal
9552460	9557140	about political stuff but I just governor Schwarzenegger was absolutely
9557140	9562280	terrible for the state I'm sorry he was he was so bad so so bad and if you need
9562280	9566160	proof here's one of many examples how taxpayer dollars were just fucking
9566160	9571340	wasted and now it's like the state is fucking broke businesses are leaving
9571340	9574820	this state they want to talk about upping taxes they're upping education I
9574820	9581380	mean like you know what's gonna oh you know what's gonna ultimately and oh you
9581380	9584620	know what's gonna ultimately end Orange Lounge radio I'm gonna tell you you
9584620	9588080	know what's gonna ultimately end this show one of us is gonna leave California
9588080	9591300	because we can't afford to be here anymore in our career it was almost that
9591300	9595860	it was literally almost that yep Dan wanted us to up and move to Washington
9595860	9607460	and I begged I was seriously in a really bad way over over that potential I can't
9607460	9612300	do it so I mean you well I won't do it you barely dodged a bullet and you know
9612300	9616900	you never know if heaven forbid myself Loki or something lost our job and could
9616900	9620280	only find something somewhere else you know that'll be what ends the show
9620280	9623860	because California couldn't fucking keep the business here because it's stuff
9623860	9629020	like this well I mean on top of that they're they're turning students away
9629020	9633860	now when that's your source of tuition right there you know for at the CS at
9633860	9638900	the CS level and they've raised the tuition so much yet they won't you know
9638900	9643000	let more students come in and put some of that money into building larger
9643000	9647260	facilities and hiring more teachers it's just absolutely ridiculous you know you
9647260	9653700	know what I'm paying right now in junior college is just under what I was paying
9653700	9663700	for my four-year school in 95 I'm paying $36 unit hour and I was paying about 42
9663700	9670540	at the University of South Alabama it's ridiculous no so I know a lot of folks
9670540	9676540	go Oh California is all sunshiny and all this stuff but it's it's can sometimes
9676540	9683220	be a little bit sad there you go sorry I didn't mean to be Debbie downer but
9683220	9687740	that's that's where we live and that's an important story to talk about please
9687740	9691740	do not let senator you get it reelected he fucked up he won that he would not
9691740	9695060	let this go he would not let it go and I think he has to pay the price for it
9695060	9700860	that's that's my my thought let's take calls 1 877 game olr or a username on
9700860	9704420	skype is orange lounge radio that's all one word the skype line is open and we
9704420	9707820	are taking calls right now although I don't know after that downer of a topic
9707820	9710660	people and we might have scared everybody off so let's see if there's
9710660	9716940	any tweets whoop whoop whoop whoop that's my wacky morning DJ noise here's
9716940	9721260	let's talk let's do a story about pot that'll make everybody feel better at
9721260	9726060	least a lot more relaxed make me throw up Tiger Claw has sent us a link to a
9726060	9729980	story on Kotaku that says hey you might want to get rid of those pictures of you
9729980	9734500	smoking weed before you unload your Nintendo 3ds and you can imagine where
9734500	9740580	this story goes somebody bought an Xbox off a Craigslist or GameStop or whatever
9740580	9745260	what is this um well was from the UK where this happened where somebody
9745260	9751700	inherited a used 3ds and on the 3ds was a picture of a dude smoking a bong which
9751700	9756540	I believe is as illegal in the UK as it is here meaning technically it's illegal
9756540	9761700	but you know most people won't do anything about it but still I mean
9761700	9767820	fucking if you're gonna sell you system back delete your pictures geez hi you're
9767820	9771260	an orange launch radio who's this hey it's the one and only Bronva hey I
9771260	9774740	haven't heard from you in a while what's up not too much I've been around here
9774740	9783180	and there you know oh I bet you get around what's up um something
9783180	9788660	interesting that happened to me and Jill video yesterday do tell we played dance
9788660	9793660	central for the very first time it took you this long I don't have a
9793660	9798860	connect and my sister who had a housewarming she has a connect in a three
9798860	9803460	and the 360 after she put her daughter down and the drinking kind of went a
9803460	9808780	little crazy she suggested a rock band let's do dance central souls like so it
9808780	9814500	was all like why the fuck not why the fuck not so you you played DDR and dance
9814500	9819980	games for many years what did you think of dance central I the main reason why
9819980	9824420	I never played dance central so I thought I would make a fool of myself
9824420	9833860	still did just it was just as funny but I noticed that to me one song and dance
9833860	9838900	central is equal to maybe in my normal two or three song dance set and DDR
9838900	9844100	because when I was done I felt like I was going to collapse well to be fair I
9844100	9847220	believe the songs are a little bit longer I don't know if they're like
9847220	9850700	they're not full length of the song but I want to say as opposed to like a
9850700	9854180	minute and a half it's more like two minutes I think it kind of feels like it
9854180	9857580	is the full-length song though yeah I mean they get enough of the song in
9857580	9863900	there that works for me so what what would you think of the songs that were
9863900	9869300	available I was tripping out when I saw the song list I was like are you
9869300	9875320	serious mm-hmm have you played did you get to play the sequel dance central to
9875320	9879880	it all yes yes cuz um we it was sitting there my sister didn't finish that one
9879880	9884540	so we was all like you know we might as well help her and um popped it in first
9884540	9891780	song I did with sandstorm Oh Lordy I was like Oh many a con many a con did you
9891780	9897900	get to see the dance for born this way I I believe somebody did do born this way
9897900	9905180	it was um it was pretty uh feminine wasn't it yes but what's enough alcohol
9905180	9909820	it's all good it's all good everything's all good with alcohol that's for sure
9909820	9916540	so did playing dance central make you go maybe I want to get a connect after all
9916540	9921980	actually kind of yeah and then we were all talking about like how come cannot
9921980	9925260	we doesn't do give us power power paradise and I was like well it kind of
9925260	9930020	gave his dance masters you know what's funny uh I'm glad you brought this up
9930020	9934340	because I forgot to mention it somewhere else it was on now keys Facebook no no
9934340	9939540	or you mentioned it as part of the UK releases the rhythm party oh I just
9939540	9942260	totally missed it cuz I was focused on something else yeah rhythm party is a
9942260	9946940	game by Konami it's all the people that did dance masters on Xbox Live arcade
9946940	9951860	and it's uh it's some like I saw the song list now if you had the song list
9951860	9956660	up but it's seriously like a bunch of Konami originals and then born this way
9956660	9961540	by Lady Gaga like they finally licensed like a big song and one other one too
9961540	9965620	that caught my eyes like celebration I think or something let me go let me go
9965620	9968620	look at now keys Facebook cuz yeah they're gonna they're gonna it's like a
9968620	9973220	$10 game I'm sure they're gonna put DLC out on it or something but it's coming

10141660	10145820	topics pretty much all right let's try to do one more quick one okay this is a
10145820	10150900	quick one this turned into like a giant 100 post third on my friends Facebook
10150900	10156140	there was a discussion about this do you believe that using a strategy guide is
10156140	10164900	cheating in a game my personal opinion it's not it's not cheating but there's
10164900	10170420	certainly a reward to some people for being able to do it without it I think
10170420	10175820	for some people it's more rewarding to do it without it but not everybody gets
10175820	10179140	that same sense of satisfaction like I definitely used to be one of those
10179140	10183260	people it's like scuff I don't need a stinkin strategy guide to get through
10183260	10187660	this game don't insult my intelligence but now I'm like yeah whatever get out
10187660	10193420	get out the iPhone let's let's pull a game facts and do that I found it hmm
10193420	10200100	does row is one of the many aliases of Osama me me get era along with D crew
10200100	10205980	positive MA and MTO does Q represents a collaboration of him and Taku well
10205980	10210660	Osama is known by his trademark hard rock sound and hard-hitting beats the
10210660	10214060	songs have appeared in Papa music beat mania beat mania TDX guitar frix
10214060	10219500	germania and dance dance revolution sorry there you go and just you know
10219500	10223420	stand in our chat room also says using a strategy guide isn't cheating I don't
10223420	10227900	think so I don't think so look at all these RPG games and I look at them like
10227900	10231940	I let me get the strategy guy I cuz I know I'm going to need it and now look
10231940	10236020	at AC strategy guys they don't really spoil anything it's just like a guy to
10236020	10239900	tell you how to get through to various levels and half the time if you're
10239900	10244260	starting to look at as a reference I will say this some strategy guides have
10244260	10249140	cheats in them mm-hmm so only you know if you looked at that page or not
10249140	10253100	usually like way in the back there might be some codes to help you cheat so it's
10253100	10256180	it's only up to you but here's my here's the other thing I would have come back
10256180	10260540	to your friend with is that if it's a single-player game who cares who cares
10260540	10264820	if it's a single-player game cheat all you want you're the one that chooses I
10264820	10268460	had to spend your $60 you know if you want to get there the hard way and get

10276460	10280420	need to do mm-hmm it's in MMOs but then of course they have strategy guides for
10280420	10284100	MMOs but I don't consider like I don't consider a Warcraft strategy guide
10284100	10289380	cheating they bundle it in the deluxe edition would allow that if it was
10289380	10294020	cheating it's not cheating it's just maps and shit you know and tips yeah
10294020	10299380	because I said this and I walked away using a strategy guide or game guide is
10299380	10304960	not cheating well you hacked the game that's when you're cheating I agree with

10352580	10357100	would block miners from playing online games for over three hours something
10357100	10360740	Tiger call linked us from gamasutra the South Korea Ministry of Education
10360740	10364820	Science and Technology is reviewing a policy that would ban miners accounts if
10364820	10369940	they play games for more than two hours consecutively or a total of three hours
10369940	10374180	in a day what would you think of that what do you think about banning kids
10374180	10382220	straight up from playing games we're buying you wasn't Ragnarok online that's
10382220	10385260	a Korean company by the way just you know there already is a law that
10385260	10390140	prevents children under 18 from playing online games during the late nights but
10390140	10393660	this would be something else kind of new trying to read through some of these
10393660	10398340	quotes here if the game industry is really a troublemaker then the related
10398340	10401660	government should discuss it and provide guidelines to instruct us that was from
10401660	10406940	a game industry representative who's trying to fight this interesting all
10406940	10409060	right let's go to the phones take another call hi you're on orange launch
10409060	10414380	radio who's this look at Zaku here hey Zaku how you doing pretty good actually
10414380	10419600	just uh resting up right now getting ready for tomorrow's a gruellish work
10419600	10425980	week tomorrow is a Monday yeah case of the Mondays yeah all right anyways no
10425980	10431380	you know aside from like having not like calling in a while been busy building
10431380	10437180	new new PC getting battlefield 3 up and running and just spending most of my
10437180	10443020	time on that sorry I've been busy having pink eye like a three-year-old wonder if
10443020	10446140	you can still spread it over the Internet's probably not let's not find
10446140	10451500	out but yeah I guess aside from like playing Battlefield 3 I kind of noticed
10451500	10455900	that this whole spat on like you know having to include online passes in games
10455900	10460380	and the fact that Kurt Schilling's video game company is like still trying to do
10460380	10466060	damage control of what were how how they ended up describing it it's like it
10466060	10469300	brings up a fundamental shift in the fact that this wasn't the case like
10469300	10474300	several years ago even like in the previous generation like Japan was like
10474300	10478620	the only country that really had had it out for used games to the point where if
10478620	10482180	I recall correctly a Supreme Court decision over there paved the way for
10482180	10488380	for retailers actually sell used games like this wasn't like I know it was like
10488380	10492660	illegal to sell like used games like you know in the early days of video gaming
10492660	10496220	over there I'm actually with you I remember that I do remember something
10496220	10499900	like that not here in the US but over there yes I do remember that and so I
10499900	10505100	guess for some reason or another due to other factors beyond their control I
10505100	10510260	guess because of like bad economic times and the fact that most gamers are are
10510260	10514020	starting to become a lot more casual like we're seeing a lot more casuals and
10514020	10519820	then hardcores to be honest so it really doesn't justify you know having a
10519820	10525860	demographic that will constantly buy it on day one you know I myself I mean I
10525860	10531260	try not to buy you know I try to buy it new but if for some reason there there's
10531260	10536060	no compelling reason whatsoever to get it that quickly I may just opt for a
10536060	10539900	used copy like most of the other games I bought you know most of them are just
10539900	10543540	like used the second-hands except for the ones that I bought new like a four
10543540	10546860	is a four that was definitely worth you know buying just because of the the
10546860	10550660	value added the fact that it was something that you know they they
10550660	10554300	offered up not only just an impressive card list but just like some really good
10554300	10559540	deal see it off the bat well but then you also get like really mediocre games
10559540	10564100	in which the only way they can really try to draw in people is to try to offer
10564100	10570780	DLC they'll they'll make up for for a lackluster game then you also have like
10570780	10575060	a recent example of that and I I know I I'm thinking there's something is this
10575060	10579220	game my mind where DLC kind of helped add stuff in a game that was kind of
10579220	10584820	lackluster trying to think right now no it can't be Mortal Kombat that game the
10584820	10588900	game was pretty good on the online pass but it's like the whole notion of trying
10588900	10593700	to trying to stifle another industry like you know GameStop I guess that
10593700	10597900	that's where they're I guess my point is like they really I guess in the next
10597900	10602220	generation we won't we probably won't see GameStop I give it like another five
10602220	10606700	years before they're like calling it quits because they because once
10606700	10610780	technology gets better to the point where where Microsoft could actually pull
10610780	10615660	off a system that detects use game copies then you know to the point where
10615660	10622380	it may not be you know may not it may not be like a viable to even like sell
10622380	10626580	any of those new copy you know any of those copies anymore that's assuming
10626580	10630460	the system is successful and I kind of think I think the consumer base at large
10630460	10634740	will reject a system with those types of restrictions in place then again it
10634740	10638940	unless of course those restrictions are like you can't play use copies at all
10638940	10643340	which would be suicide for for that manufacturer anyway but something that
10643340	10647580	basically instead of having a paper printout of a of an online passcode
10647580	10652380	something that gets activated for that particular account you know like if you
10652380	10658340	you you run the disk once and you need you need like a like an account I guess
10658340	10662980	like a gold account or something on an Xbox Live where it would detect that you
10662980	10667460	already ran this particular copy of the game and you get that online pass so any
10667460	10670940	other person running that game afterwards for a different account will
10670940	10675780	have to pay so something like that which is which takes a sting out of a
10675780	10680180	draconian system that would just prevent use games from playing at all well and
10680180	10684380	it's also insulting when I pay $60 for the game and I'm paying this premium you
10684380	10689900	know I get with 99 cent or dollar 99 games you know that's a digital license
10689900	10693220	or whatever but like you know with $60 I want my physical copy that I could take
10693220	10696640	to a friend's house this is ridiculous you know at some point the consumers are
10696640	10701220	going to say no to that so I I think that whole thing was a load of bullshit
10701220	10705180	I understand but it has to be at a point where it gets really bad right now it
10705180	10709260	really isn't because you know what most gamers don't really care they'll just
10709260	10712940	they'll just know that if the game is like really good and it's and it has
10712940	10717140	good reviews and it's getting a lot of buzz that they'll line up outside of
10717140	10722100	GameStop or Best Buy to get it day one. So why was the PSP Go not successful?
10722100	10727420	Well I guess it's it's it's a factors in in the sense that it was all digital
10727420	10732700	like people want and you're right you do bring up a point of having to wanting to
10732700	10737460	own your you know the games that you buy and I kind of have to go through the
10737460	10741980	same thing with Steam in that all the PC games that I that currently own are all
10741980	10746820	digital so you know but I know. I know very sorry sorry to interrupt but I know
10746820	10751100	very few people that spend like $50 to get games on Steam there are some
10751100	10755940	there's some. I only buy on the sale or unless I really need to have that copy. Everybody buys Steam stuff on the sale
10755940	10759140	because it's dirt cheap and so you don't mind that you're not having a physical
10759140	10764260	copy because but there are certain times where I did buy the game for price like
10764260	10767540	there were certain times where I actually like how to like suck it up and
10767540	10772700	buy those games full price. I bought one. I bought Civilization 5 at full price
10772700	10777220	that's it. Like right now I'm gonna have to buy Skyrim full price because you
10777220	10782100	know what the sale wasn't like it was it was not low enough in the sense that I
10782100	10785260	could probably pick it up cheap later on but if I wanted to play it right now
10785260	10788740	would have to suck it up same thing with Battlefield 3 I bought that full price
10788740	10793460	it was Origin but nevertheless I bought it I didn't I didn't wait for it to go
10793460	10797380	on sale I wanted to play that now and I still haven't bought the the expansion
10797380	10801660	bag yet. I just want to point out you don't have to shop around a little bit
10801660	10806060	because Steam is charging $59.99 still I think but I looked at Amazon for $47.46.
10806060	10809420	Well that's the thing that Battlefield 3 is only on Origin anything other than
10809420	10814540	Steam remember that whole spat where EA wanted to like you know because of what
10814540	10819780	Valve set up in their terms that they took most of their games away out of Steam
10819780	10825220	and into Origin. Why get a digital copy then? Well because it sucks having you
10825220	10828660	know it doesn't make a difference if it's activated through Origin because
10828660	10833140	that's that's where all EA games are going you know at this rate so even if I
10833140	10838640	have a digital copy only be tied to my Origin account just like Steam. Alright I
10838640	10843380	gotta wrap up and let you go buddy but we'll hope that gaming manufacturers get
10843380	10847420	the right idea what we really want. Alright yeah definitely have a good one.
10847420	10850740	Alright you too buddy. Alright that's gonna do it for the Sky Flying tonight.
10850740	10854100	We're running a little bit over tonight so we're gonna wrap it up and get on out
10854100	10858220	of here but first I want to go around see if there's any last-minute stories
10858220	10864800	Dark Sakura or Loki? Meh. Nothing I really wanted to talk about. No? I know like
10864800	10868180	Dark Souls you wanted me to mention there was some gaming chair so not even really
10868180	10872380	gaming chair but like some PC pod chair thing that you know that someone's
10872380	10877060	trying to sell it it's really expensive and sort of looks like you know some
10877060	10881940	immersion rig from you know Ready Player One or something but uh oh yeah yeah I
10881940	10885620	saw that you know I was expensive you know and there was another story that he
10885620	10889060	posted that was interesting about the whole like world record somebody spent
10889060	10893300	like 40 hours trying to beat some DDR record and got denied by Guinness but it
10893300	10896700	was a little bit too busy of a Newsweek to fit something like that in especially
10896700	10902220	you know DDR's. I saw one that was also I was it Jimmy Kimmel or not Jimmy Kimmel
10902220	10909660	uh Jimmy Fallon did some really stupid record a while back where most consoles
10909660	10912940	played in a minute you know something like that were like I don't even know
10912940	10917060	how you arbitrarily do that because it's like press a press a press a press it's
10917060	10919820	not even they have to do something for a second I don't even know what the
10919820	10924180	requirements like WarioWare in real life. It's stupid but then someone else
10924180	10928180	apparently beat their record or they claim to beat the record with 13 consoles
10928180	10934460	played I don't know it's dumb I mean that's you can't have a record on that
10934460	10939380	because there's what are you gonna say that you it can constitutes playing just
10939380	10947220	like pushing pause and I mean pushing a I don't know we have had 16 consoles on
10947220	10952340	in my house before well you need to do WarioWare IRL where you just run
10952340	10956440	around all those you know and do do something for a second on each one do
10956440	10961220	doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo all right we're gonna go around wrap up the
10961220	10966300	show and get everybody's final thoughts so where do we start Dark Sakura thank
