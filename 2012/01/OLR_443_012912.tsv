14018	25946	Tonight, January 29th, 2012, a network makeover is rumored for Nintendo consoles, a new handheld may bring back a classic gaming system, and Steam goes mobile with a new iOS app.
31587	38869	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38989	47112	We are live on this January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.
47692	51513	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
51713	55194	First off, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55414	55614	Hi.
55995	56575	How are you, Ms.
56595	56895	Summers?
57495	58395	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
87912	88632	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
108442	114068	My mommy just had surgery and I know she hasn't listened to the show, but I'm thinking about my mother.
114228	116130	She had surgery on Friday, but she's doing a lot better.
116870	119012	So I had to go visit her today because she's out of the hospital.
120694	123897	Anyhow, let's talk about who else is here with us here in studio.
123977	125339	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
125599	125779	Hi.
126059	127080	How are you, Tech Master Loki?
127200	127721	I'm fine.
127961	129242	Are you on your period or are we good?
129603	131625	I'm fine, I guess.
132185	134387	You're always angry on this show, no matter what it is.
134407	135908	I was like, I don't know how to answer that.
137489	137810	Yes.
138990	139871	What's new with Loki?
142313	142793	Not much.
142934	144335	Just playing Skyrim.
144615	145015	All right.
145055	146797	Well, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit.
146837	151280	But first, I have to plug, of course, the lovely All Games Radio, where we do our show every week.
151880	157385	www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
157425	158526	It is where we tape live.
158846	159847	If you are listening live...
160327	163609	and we hope you do sometime if you have been listening on the podcast all these years.
163969	166131	If you are listening live, join us in our chat room.
166191	173936	Just point your browsers over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com and there's a fine little Java chat room that will open right up and you can join our chat room.
173956	188046	If you prefer to do it the old school way, you can do it with an IRC client still because our chat room is IRC based and you just want to connect to the Game Surge Network at irc.gamesurge.net and we are in channel with the channel sign of the pound Orange Lounge.
188486	189567	This is where you can find us
191888	192328	Hey, Rob.
192468	193108	Yes, ma'am.
193208	195789	I have to share the neat thing that I just posted in the chat room.
195909	196189	Okay.
196529	199651	Apparently, some nerd has narrowed down when Ice Cube's good day was.
200911	202232	Like, isn't today was a good day?
202472	203212	What day was it?
203872	205573	Well, I'll just... Wasn't today, right?
205613	207134	I'll go through just a quickie on this one.
207174	209315	The clues were they were watching Yo!
209455	211595	MTV Raps, which started on August 6, 1988.
211936	217058	The single was released on February 23, 1993, and the Lakers beat the Supersonics.
217098	217898	Okay.
218358	234794	so they narrowed down all of those dates and then went to clue four the dates the Laker wins over the Supersonics was a clear day with no smog so they narrowed it down to November 30th 88 and at the date in 89 91 and 92 good lord some people have too much free time
235120	235720	Clue 5.
235800	237060	Got a beep from Kim.
237781	239301	So it was when beepers were available.
239341	240561	So that led it to two dates.
241422	242742	January 18th, 1991.
242802	243582	January 20th, 1992.
245182	245423	Clue 6.
246223	248543	Ice Cube started filming Boys in the Hood in 1991.
249143	250124	There was only one day.
250144	251204	I'm going to quote this.
251604	254425	Only one day where UMTV Reps was on air.
254485	255785	It was a clear and smogless day.
255865	257185	Beepers were commercially sold.
257546	260446	Lakers beat the Supersonics and Ice Cube had no events to attend.
260786	261206	January 20th, 1992.
261246	261867	National Good Day Day.
266106	269878	So we just celebrated 20 years of today was a good day 20 years ago.
270179	270359	Yeah.
272242	274422	What an incredibly useless piece of information.
274622	277803	But I thought it was cool that someone went to the trouble and I wanted to share it.
277863	278803	That's when the good day was.
278983	283924	And for those listening to Orange Lawns Radio for the first time, those are the lovely types of tidbits you can expect.
283964	285705	But we will get into video games here in a minute.
286205	288925	First, I have to apologize to LiveLicious and the podcasters.
288965	291566	There was no live show last week and it was a little bit last minute.
291586	292946	We had to cancel the show due to illness.
293546	295666	And I was a little bit self-conscious about it last week.
295686	298147	I didn't want to talk about it a whole lot, but I'll talk about it now.
298767	301471	I had pink eye, which is why we didn't have the show last week.
301491	302112	The undead plague.
303194	304836	Or is, what did Victoria call it?
304996	306158	Eye herps or something like that.
306238	306438	Look.
310224	312928	DarkSakura just choked on her soda when I said that.
315391	321618	It's like, what am I, seven and going to a preschool where kids are putting fingers in their butt and their eye or something?
322079	325543	No, I work in a place with adults and stuff.
325643	325983	I don't know.
326003	327385	We had a pink eye outbreak at work.
327725	328866	It just... Undead plague.
329287	330088	I don't know what happened.
330328	332210	Someone got careless with the mascara at work.
332270	357073	I got pink eye because I do work with primarily women and I got pink eye just because everybody else in the office had it so unfortunately what that means is that nobody wants to come over to Rob's house where the studio is or touch the equipment and everything like that because he has pink eye and when one co-host has a kid at home and you know the other just doesn't want pink eye it kind of fucks up the show for the night oh no you are you I was eating cheesecake fuck your pink eye something
360290	360670	Pink Eye, WTF?
386102	412840	yes but you have to remember pink eye is super duper contagious like it's not like I lick the eyes of these women I work with like if you touch something they've touched you can get it like break room stuff you know so so yeah yeah yet Alan who lives here with me never got it so I don't know what that's about maybe you have natural immunity to the undead plague you will be the salvation of us all
413749	419232	And I actually wiped down all of the mics in the studio area with Clark's wipes to make sure.
419252	420533	You're so considerate, thank you.
420573	422594	Yeah, I never got pink eye, so Rob's lying.
422614	423355	This whole story's a lie.
424475	434041	I had a very, very minor case of pink eye, and yet it was like Alan went through here in a hazmat suit making sure he would not get it no matter what happened.
434401	442666	So, uh, um, Ahamakara in our chat room at chat.orange.com says someone wasn't washing their hands after using the potty.
442987	443227	Okay.
443287	452913	First off, I find that to be one of the most disgusting habits of men that I see in the potty is that I see guys who just walk in the restroom, do their thing, walk right out.
453053	453914	They don't even flush.
454154	455795	They don't even stop to walk, wash their hands.
456015	457296	And if that's you...
459017	461178	And you know who you are, that's gross.
461518	462218	A, flush.
463078	463978	B, wash.
464578	465479	It's not that hard.
465599	473841	Although, I will say, it has been proven that the place with the most germs on the body is actually the mouth and the hands.
474801	476981	So you were right about not washing the hands regularly.
477561	479762	However, the butt is one of the cleanest places.
481601	484867	Thank you for that piece of information So what have I learned today?
484947	490438	January 20th was a good day And my ass is kind of clean after all Thank you And urine is sterile
493715	494215	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
523454	525616	There's really nothing to talk about until it airs, though.
526356	526857	That's true.
527858	531621	So I guess we'll just combine the two worlds a little bit.
531921	532701	I tried.
532721	533662	All right.
533682	537365	So going around in Xbox bullshit this week.
554099	557761	I don't know, it might be true, but look, it's the pink elephant in the room.
557781	558902	Everybody's talking about it.
558962	564745	It's the whole, the new Xbox, which we're calling, we will not call it the Xbox 720 here on Orange Lounge Radio.
564765	566145	I'm sorry, that's not what it's going to be called.
566586	573589	We already decided weeks ago, amongst a highly scientific process, we will refer to this system as the Xbox Lube until Microsoft gives us something better.
574130	578212	So the Xbox Lube supposedly is not going to play used games whatsoever.
578552	579513	That I guess there's this...
580533	587240	Amazing technology that will just fuck your disc up once you install a game or something.
587661	589082	Loki, clue us all in.
589122	590684	How is this technology supposed to work?
590784	591925	I don't fucking know.
592406	593327	It doesn't exist.
595729	598210	It's going to use these cardboard rings.
598390	609574	Basically, what happens is it'll prompt you to enter in a special code that's generated by turning these rings so that you can create a certain phrase.
609614	611895	Like, for example, Banana Monkey Pirate.
613196	618218	Or you'll have to get out the instruction manual and look up the keyword on page 24.
619562	633398	Some of which may actually require the use of a decoder device that will be a red plastic transparent piece of... I don't know, codes?
635185	635565	Okay, no.
636146	653173	What I think I was reading about what's supposed to happen is it's supposed to be that the Xbox would have a burner in it, that the drive functions is both a burner and a reader, and once you play the game for the first time, it would basically burn your console's serial into the disc.
654233	668796	and at that point it would only work on that console and I'm like that has got to be the most hideous idea I've ever heard like really like so I can't take a disc over to a friend's house anymore and play the game I mean that's how crazy we're getting
670089	671430	It's not gonna happen.
700229	706799	GameStop, who is by far the biggest company out there selling games to consumers.
707119	710964	And it'd be also the same way if they decided, hey, we're going to go digital only.
711245	714630	Now granted, with that, they could sell the little cards that they're doing now.
715811	716272	That's fine.
716532	721016	But, I mean, there's not a lot of money to be made in new games.
721196	724939	It's all used sales is where they're making their money.
725039	732066	And, yeah, they could probably, you know, force some sort of kickbacks from, you know, these hardware manufacturers.
732086	733167	But it's not going to happen.
733247	733827	It's just not...
734608	735869	No one's going to buy into that.
735889	737631	They're going to be like, fuck that bullshit.
737751	745637	I'm going to buy a PlayStation or a Wii U. We definitely see game companies are already trying to kind of cut at the knees a little bit of the used game market.
745677	747259	We see the online passes.
747539	750101	We see a big push towards digital distribution.
750161	754225	Like, isn't the Vita supposed to have the games are cheaper now to download than they are?
754285	756627	But they haven't released any of those yet, so we don't know.
756727	759609	I mean, Japan, I mean, it may be a little bit cheaper.
759669	762171	But even still, though, it's just...
763152	767536	That stuff is kind of to entice you to buy new, not forcing you to buy new.
768396	774060	And, I mean, they're not going to do anything like that anyways to tie it to one system.
774341	779405	Because, come on, what company had a huge failure rate with their launch systems?
779765	781346	Who's really going to risk that bullshit?
781386	784909	Oh, I bought 20 games, but now they're all fucking useless because my system died.
785229	785769	I don't think so.
785789	786850	They're not going to do that.
787971	790293	It would be so ridiculous to even try to do that.
790493	791514	And let's just say that...
792845	793565	Thanks for watching!
814833	818395	Now, granted, I think that was only one theory about how it's all supposed to work.
818716	822858	I mean, that theory is so vague and just like, well, here's how I think.
823218	824119	It doesn't make any sense.
824139	825420	They're just making assumptions.
825900	827361	There's no data to support that.
827481	835306	Yes, will they continue on this trend where they're going to have some sort of code that you put in to give you some extra something or other?
835547	836107	Yeah, maybe.
836407	840610	Are they going to maybe do something where it's going to tie it to your console as far as like...
840990	842731	Your game saves or something, maybe.
842971	846153	I don't know, but I think Microsoft's a little bit more lax with that at least.
847534	848995	You're tying them to at least your profile.
849256	850516	But even that, you can get around.
852418	859622	I just don't think anyone's going to do anything that ballsy right now as far as making it where used games will just not play on the system.
859642	865066	Because I'm telling you, if one does that and the other ones don't, that's a big disadvantage for them.
865426	870630	I mean, because GameStop will just say, fuck you guys, I'm not going to support your system as much.
871731	872431	Well, you know what?
872611	881478	Microsoft's in an interesting situation as well with the whole online pass is that I don't think Microsoft can still justify the online pass for their first party games.
881958	889844	And if they do it, there's going to be a lot of crap that they're going to start getting because notice they're the one company that kind of hasn't been able to do it yet because they're charging for Xbox Live.
890724	894167	So, I mean, literally, they're going to start double dipping for online passes.
894347	895348	See, here's the thing, though.
895888	897149	Theirs is a little bit different.
897989	899991	It's the same, it's same but different, I guess.
900731	908456	They have content that comes with the launch, I guess the launch pressing or whatever, the first pressing of a game.
908796	910598	They have extra content that comes with it.
910998	918443	Now, the thing is, so they're not fucking putting out there saying, hey, this is our online pass.
919003	920504	It's just, it's download content.
920544	926108	Like, for example, I think with Alan Wake, you got like an episode or something for, it's like the first piece of download content for free.
926548	931271	And that's cool that they're putting something in there for you to entice you to buy new.
931531	937874	And that's all they have to do is spin it with EA instead of saying this is an online pass.
938074	938975	They say, hey, guess what?
939255	944458	The first launch pressing of this game is going to get some extra download content with it.
945123	947503	Oh my god, you don't even have to fucking call it an online pass.
947784	949484	Why did you call it an online pass?
949504	951284	There's such a negative connotation with that.
951644	957526	And you're just going to go and cut yourself at the knees just because this is what you've done in the other games?
957746	962687	Just say, hey, look, it's a bonus DLC that we're putting out for those people that buy new.
963087	966307	If you buy it used, you can still enjoy the wonderful game, but you're going to have to buy the DLC.
966447	969088	I mean, that's not that bad.
969668	971048	And people can kind of expect it.
971148	974149	Why should I get fucking free DLC if I didn't buy the game new?
975867	977789	It's just how they're phrasing it.
977809	979990	They really were dumb how they phrased it.
980971	988175	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeonestradio.com, Amiga777 says, unless the next Xbox is download only, then that could be a problem.
988235	989676	It's not going to fucking happen.
990096	991537	Well, let me say something for a minute.
991778	998122	You can't be download only because we all have those caps on the Comcast service and stuff.
998162	999562	It's still a 250 gig cap.
1000163	1003485	One Xbox 360 game, if it's a big one, I mean, some of them don't really fill up the disk.
1003525	1004306	They're like maybe 900 megs.
1005306	1009009	Some of them, though, like, you know, are probably, what, a good four or five gigabytes.
1009089	1010190	Blu-rays, especially.
1010210	1011511	It's on average six gigs.
1011611	1011892	Yeah.
1011952	1014394	So, I mean, you can only download so many of those.
1014434	1017276	And if you're streaming more movies, something's going to give.
1017476	1019077	Everybody wants a piece of this.
1019558	1025022	Now Xbox wants to charge me to, you know, download the game because I can't buy it used anymore.
1025082	1029005	But yet Comcast wants to charge me for using the bandwidth to download the game.
1029085	1030627	I mean, the consumers are going to reject this.
1031127	1031648	at some point.
1031668	1032789	They're going to say it's not worth it.
1032849	1034470	Go back to playing the old system.
1034570	1040816	And once again, some people will buy digital downloads, and they have that out there right now.
1042117	1050805	There's nothing wrong with offering things in multiple ways, whether you want to buy a new disc, you want to buy a used disc, you want to buy a digital copy, you want to rent, whatever.
1052687	1054188	There's nothing wrong with that.
1055629	1056629	giving people options.
1056749	1061250	But when you start forcing people to download only, then people aren't going to buy your system.
1062070	1063150	Hello, PSP Go.
1063991	1064331	Yeah, I know.
1064371	1066931	I think the PSP Go is a great example of that.
1067411	1073532	I know people that own a PSP Go that actually really like the system from a hardware perspective and all of that.
1073892	1083374	So it really sounds like what happened with the PSP Go was kind of a tragedy because their whole implementing the digital download thing kind of got rejected by the user base as a whole and only, you know,
1083914	1092459	Definitely people that were more into hardware and the gamophobes or whatever you want to call them, gamophiles, were really into the system.
1092599	1094321	Otherwise, it was really rejected by people.
1094421	1111031	And I think if the game makers kind of go down that path of making these systems that are going to be really complicated and expensive for the end user, I think they are going to make a hideous mistake that most people...

1133630	1136512	Okay, first off, most of those people aren't going to know what a DivX machine is.
1136532	1138053	But you know what I mean, right?
1138073	1147780	The second that people aren't going to be comfortable, you know, your average consumer, sadly, is not comfortable with understanding how digital downloads work and stuff.
1148121	1149041	They don't understand how...
1150302	1155787	That is... And that's why I don't think, like, WiiWare's taken off, really, for Nintendo as far as, like, I think more of the hardcore crowd.
1155807	1163634	Because no one's... I mean, if they offered it in a way, they presented it like Wii Sports Resort had DLC or something like that.
1163654	1166096	Well, of course, you know, none of the Nintendo games had DLC.
1166996	1171140	If they had DLC for, like, Wii Sports Resort, maybe they would have sold some stuff.
1171240	1171400	But...
1172601	1174242	I think most people aren't comfortable with that.
1174582	1188608	I mean, hell, with those wireless systems, I'd be willing to bet most people didn't know how to hook it up to their internet, let alone be able to have the equipment to hook it up to their internet, because a lot of people don't have Wi-Fi in their house.
1190048	1198051	Bochikawa in our chatroom at chat.orangelandredo.com says, I saw a PSP go for sale at Kmart last week, and I said, huh, didn't know they still made those.
1198412	1200512	Oh, wait, those were probably just never taken off the shelf.
1200752	1201693	Dude, you were at Kmart.
1203792	1206976	I was at Kmart What did you find?
1207056	1207596	Dust bunnies?
1208177	1217427	No, I bought cat litter there Because cat litter doesn't go bad It doesn't matter if it's five years old Do they still have the doors that have the pressure sensors that you step on to open them up?
1218549	1219550	That's always fascinating
1221025	1226051	Actually, I couldn't tell because they were very squishy anyway.
1226111	1227533	Do they still have the icy machines?
1227974	1229235	No, they didn't have an icy machine.
1229275	1230777	Everybody has icy machines now.
1231518	1234141	I did, however, go to the opening of a 7-Eleven.
1234561	1234802	Yeah?
1235162	1236524	And they gave out free Slurpees.
1236724	1237285	Good times.
1237825	1241228	All right, going to the chat room from other comments on Loki's rants and this whole story.
1241308	1244331	Spazinator PC says, Download only is risky.
1244711	1247153	Look at what I went through with Sony and my videos.
1247213	1252218	Kind of referencing how his PlayStations will break or he'll lose the license to his videos.
1252238	1253379	And he's had this huge collection.
1253399	1254379	It's just a big pain in the butt.
1255240	1258103	Uni in our chat room says, I rather want a physical copy of the game.
1258143	1259604	It's all about the gratification.
1260004	1261005	And I agree with that, too.
1261085	1261366	There is...
1262886	1266468	What happens to game collectors if things go digital only?
1266888	1275972	DarkSakura, I imagine that's got to piss you off to no end because you and Dan are so into collecting that if everything goes digital, it's like, great, what do I have to show for it?
1276012	1276592	Bits and bytes.
1276912	1278513	Great, where am I going to get a job?
1279994	1286856	Because there goes the need for your manuals for production material.
1288797	1290258	It's pissing me off.
1291195	1292076	Well, let me put it this way.
1292116	1299641	A lot of this stuff I think already is digital as far as Xbox Live Arcade, Xbox Indie Games, PlayStation Network, all that stuff.
1299901	1302022	There's a lot of digital content out there already.
1302342	1311008	I think if you're going to see anything in the new consoles, it's probably going to be some sort of actual cloud streaming as well where you may have the option to stream your game or whatever.
1311048	1316091	Instead of a demo, you get a timed demo of the actual full game and get to play that.
1316291	1318493	You mean what they're doing now on PlayStation Plus?
1319233	1344166	or you can actually have games on demand almost where you actually rent them and play them that way because that way the publisher still gets a kickback and it's all trackable and it's win-win gamers get to try a game and the publishers get paid
1345356	1345637	DarkSakura.com
1358363	1362765	It does this thing where the cursor will freeze and it's seriously pissing me off.
1364005	1366466	I actually got Bubble Bobble for iPhone.
1366806	1367426	Not Bubble Bobble.
1368247	1368887	Puzzle Bobble.
1369287	1369767	Best move.
1370307	1371888	I've been playing the crap out of it.
1372708	1377770	Because if there's a puzzle game that I think I love almost as much as P.O.P.O., it's Puzzle Bobble.
1378749	1380130	How does that work with the iOS touch?
1380150	1382652	Do you just kind of touch on the grid where you want the bubble to fly?
1382772	1384634	You drag your finger across.
1385294	1389377	But it kind of sucks if you've accidentally tapped it.
1390018	1391859	And then, oh shoot, I sent the bubble out.
1392219	1393540	But so far it's not like super hard.
1393600	1396022	I've gotten like a gold star on every level but one.
1397203	1400165	And I've beaten the first two areas.
1401446	1401627	So...
1404270	1405252	I've played that.
1405652	1407215	I've played WoW.
1407976	1412884	I really haven't done a lot of playing of much of anything else though just because I've been hurting.
1413184	1417210	I was going to start Skyrim but I'd really rather play it on PC.
1418479	1420880	You should go check out how Alan's modded his all out.
1420940	1423001	He's made the inventory screens usable.
1423021	1423682	It's pretty awesome.
1423702	1424022	Cool.
1424222	1426183	That's one of the nice things about having it on PC, I think.
1426824	1430986	But I'm still loyal to my PS3 because I like to sit my big butt on the couch and have my controller.
1431146	1433507	And Dan's lusting out for the new Borderlands.
1434308	1434928	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1435008	1435208	Yeah.
1435448	1435688	Soon.
1436169	1438150	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1438590	1441311	Well, since it's been a few weeks, I played quite a bit, actually.
1442312	1445674	Of course, there's new DLC for Saints Row III.
1448937	1452798	I mean, I kind of knew what it was going to be just looking at it.
1453298	1457880	Basically, the new Saints Row, the third DLC, is Genki Vol.
1457900	1457880	7.
1457960	1463041	It's a bunch of side missions or activities, if you will, that you get to play in.
1463581	1467942	And most of them are just kind of redressed activities from the regular game.
1468042	1476505	Like, they have an escort mission where you're escorting Genki and then you run people over with your car and that charges up a flamethrower that you...
1477285	1477666	and DarkSakura.
1487270	1488371	and SadPanda.
1488451	1491113	It's just a mayhem mission like they have in the regular game.
1491133	1491893	So that was neat, I guess.
1491913	1495756	And then, of course, there was another one that was basically just the regular Professor Genki
1517870	1521652	and just his normal running through a maze and killing mascots and stuff.
1521752	1536639	And then the one that was actually really weird that I thought was the most enjoyable out of all of them because it is actually unique was where you're skydiving as a panda through rings, landing on roofs and then chainsawing mascots and then skydiving down some more, bouncing off of balloons and stuff like that.
1537040	1537840	It's really ridiculous.
1538280	1542482	But that was kind of fun because it was somewhat unique.
1542582	1543503	The only thing that's...
1544463	1545304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1566145	1569528	Two different levels of each activity that they had there.
1569548	1575754	I mean, they could have added a ton more activities or at least more versions of it that were difficult or increasingly difficult.
1575794	1586244	But no, they took the easy way out and just pretty much put out the, I don't know, the most minimal version of DLC as possible.
1586264	1586384	Yeah.
1587495	1588136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1610854	1612355	And then, what else?
1612495	1615058	Oh, I played, I downloaded some indie games.
1615098	1617520	I actually played one of them, which is DLC Quest.
1618881	1620942	Oh, yeah, I remember that one.
1621062	1622724	DLC Quest, it's kind of funny.
1622744	1626947	I mean, it's more of like, it's something that would be a free Flash game.
1627528	1631411	I mean, it's a cute little concept, but the game's over in less than an hour.
1632232	1634754	I mean, but it's a buck, so it's not that bad.
1635294	1636515	Better than paying $7 for 45 minutes.
1639317	1640499	So, it was alright.
1640539	1641940	I mean, I'd recommend it if you want to check it out.
1641980	1643902	But that's kind of the problem with indie games.
1643922	1649387	There's a lot of cool concepts on there, but when you go and play them, they're really short.
1649827	1653010	And it's just, I don't know, it's kind of disappointing that it's not a full-fledged game.
1655513	1658375	And then, let's see, what else did I play?
1658536	1659817	Oh, of course, tons of Skyrim.
1660197	1660738	I'm already...
1662139	1663219	God, I don't even know.
1663600	1665541	Probably 120 hours into the game already.
1667242	1674307	Level 54, although once I glitch out the Ogma Infinium, that'll be level 81 soon enough.
1675988	1677610	And let's see what else.
1678871	1680652	Did I do anything fun in Skyrim?
1681372	1681693	I don't know.
1681913	1684134	The game's getting more glitchy, as I mentioned before.
1684515	1690759	I'm having texture problems now where it's not drawing the proper textures on things and all sorts of weird stuff happening.
1690899	1693001	But there's a new patch coming in really soon for Skyrim, right?
1693341	1694302	I don't think it's going to fix it.
1694803	1696544	Every patch makes things worse, okay?
1696685	1697225	I'm telling you.
1698746	1699447	So we'll see.
1700568	1707515	At least that patch, though, the very least, that is going to fix the Blood on Ice mission, the one that's all fucked up for me right now.
1708175	1710117	So I'm glad that that's going to be fixed soon.
1710337	1712479	And then, of course, Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
1712960	1715903	I'm playing lots of that and kicking ass.
1716471	1716691	Nice.
1717811	1718051	All right.
1718371	1722072	Quickly, my gaming week, because there really hasn't been a whole lot I've been playing this week outside of WoW.
1722152	1723733	There's not a lot of World of Warcraft this week.
1723873	1724573	Hey, you know what?
1724873	1725673	That's what I've been into.
1726513	1734115	There's not a lot of old games I've really gone back to visit, although we did manage to get a copy of Toy Story Midway Mania on the Wii.
1734455	1735976	Because, you know, I love Disneyland.
1735996	1737416	I love the rides and all that stuff.
1737476	1739337	So Midway Mania is one of my favorite rides.
1739737	1741357	So I was like, what the heck?
1741537	1743618	Let's just check this out and see what it's like.
1743658	1743898	And it's...
1744998	1755094	Okay, yeah, they try to emulate the ride by basically you point the Wiimote at the screen, you hit A and try to hit the targets, but as you can imagine, it's pretty basic.
1755294	1756476	Did you play it in 3D?
1757337	1758599	No, I heard you could.
1758619	1760082	It's supposed to come with glasses.
1760542	1763683	No, I had a used one, so maybe they didn't have it.
1764063	1766283	So, I don't know.
1767703	1768984	I guess I'll have to... What are they?
1769004	1770464	Are they the red-blue or are they the polarized ones?
1770484	1771184	I don't know.
1771364	1772024	I think it's red-blue.
1772584	1776285	I wonder if it's kind of like the Ride, which uses the polarized ones.
1776425	1776845	I don't know.
1776865	1779825	No, it's not like... Or maybe if I steal a copy from the Ride, maybe it'll work at home.
1779865	1782926	No, you don't have a TV that supports polarized classes.
1784126	1786427	It's either red-blue or the cyan-purple stuff.
1786667	1787367	Yeah, I'm sure.
1787507	1788407	Or cyan-green.
1788647	1793131	It's probably, you know, it's not going to really change my opinion on the game.
1793811	1797494	They've tried to do some cute stuff with, like, you know, collecting stickers.
1797614	1803118	And, you know, all the levels are not quite the same that they are in the ride itself.
1803458	1806821	You feel a lot of influence from achievements and that whole thing.
1807161	1809303	You know, you've got to score so many points on a stage.
1809603	1810944	But everything's relatively easy.
1810964	1812966	But you have to remember, it's a Disney game.
1813246	1814567	It's more geared towards kids.
1815047	1819991	I bet it would be kind of fun to bring out at a party, especially with my friends that love Disneyland.
1820311	1825075	Let's say DarkSakura, myself, and maybe a couple of other Disney-loving friends got together and did some drinking.
1825375	1826156	This game might be fun.
1827621	1828822	Anything's fun with drinking.
1828902	1829502	Exactly.
1830262	1832364	You know what game would be fun with drinking?
1832424	1832644	What?
1832964	1835385	Is the Kinect Disneyland Adventures, I think would be fun.
1835405	1836706	I totally want that game still.
1836946	1837946	I've heard it's pretty good.
1838026	1839847	I don't have it myself, but I have some friends who have it.
1839887	1841448	It's surprisingly not as bad as you'd think.
1841468	1843229	There's also that other one that they're doing.
1843269	1848352	Was it the Kinect Rush Disney Pixar Adventure?
1849212	1854877	I hadn't heard of that, no It's coming out in March Is that similar to the Disneyland Adventures?
1855598	1857880	Sort of California Adventures maybe?
1858280	1869290	No, it's all Pixar movies But they have like the Incredibles and stuff in there and Ratatouille I want to see WALL-E's in there too, which is kind of cool Very cool
1869950	1872632	All right, well, otherwise, that's really the only new game I've been playing this week.
1872672	1880177	Keep in mind, next week, I have Coming to My House Tuesday, Final Fantasy XIII 2, and Soul Calibur V. So it's going to be a busy week next week.
1880197	1882058	I haven't finished XIII, so you know what?
1882158	1883078	I'm holding off on it.
1884659	1885080	You know what?
1885200	1887461	I never completely finished it either, but I'm not going to.
1888382	1890723	I'm worried that's going to stop a lot of people from playing it.
1890763	1891524	But you know what?
1891704	1893125	Just go watch the spoiler video online.
1893225	1895766	I already know what the spoiler is, but I still want to finish the game.
1895786	1896127	All right.
1896847	1914537	Well, Soul Calibur V is coming out this week, and believe it or not, we know somebody who's been able to get their hands on it already, and we're going to call him right now, and he's going to come on and talk to us a little bit about Soul Calibur V. And it's my buddy from the one and only Horde House.
1915978	1917599	Extifer should hopefully be on the line.
1917619	1917959	Hello?
1918980	1919560	Hello?
1919700	1920661	Is this Extifer?
1920681	1920781	Hello?
1921909	1923231	Xtifer, SoulCalibur V
1937462	1938244	This is true.
1938464	1938764	All right.
1938804	1942069	Now, I don't know how you did that, but I'm not going to ask questions.
1942169	1943931	But OK, so you had to play Soul Calibur 5.
1944192	1951121	So first off, now, I think our listeners have to remember you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?
1951161	1953625	You play a lot of WoW, but you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?
1956171	1956732	Not usually.
1957232	1966995	I got a PS3 last year, and I played through Uncharted 2, and I have a few fighting games.
1967556	1971377	Well, a couple of fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 4.
1972117	1979040	So I've been getting down with console games lately.
1979180	1980020	You're getting jiggy with it?
1980040	1981341	You're getting jiggy with the consoles?
1983342	1983882	I guess.
1983902	1984182	Yeah.
1984582	1986646	Have you ever played a Soul Calibur game in your life?
1987868	1988148	Yes.
1989110	1996041	I played... Well, I actually played the original Soul Blade, which I guess was Soul Edge in Japan.
1996983	1997143	And...
1999249	2005932	I did play that when it came out on the PlayStation years and years and years ago.
2006412	2012195	And then I played Soul Calibur 2 when I actually lived with you.
2013136	2015557	Because I remember you got the GameCube version with Link.
2017498	2019039	Yep, yep, good times.
2019439	2028924	So I do remember playing that, but that was the last time I ever played any kind of Soul Calibur game was your copy of Soul Calibur 2.
2029084	2031645	Well, you know what you're saying isn't different from a lot of people.
2031665	2041090	A lot of people missed Soul Calibur 3 because it was kind of late in the PlayStation 2 lifespan, and if I remember right, it was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so it never came out to the other consoles.
2041130	2046333	Then Soul Calibur 4, some people saw Darth Vader and Yoda on the box and were like, no thank you.
2047293	2050335	Although I think Soul Calibur 4 wasn't bad.
2050656	2051997	I like all the Soul Calibur games.
2052617	2054338	Alright, so here we are, Soul Calibur 5.
2054639	2056020	So tell us a little bit about the game.
2057813	2079575	Yeah, I was lucky enough to get a collector's edition, and I didn't really know what to expect, so I started playing with the story mode, which, I don't know what it is about fighting games and story modes, but they're all lame.
2080917	2084520	They all, like, I think that the story mode is kind of cheap.
2085081	2089745	All of the cutscenes are like little, you know, comic book pictures.
2090986	2097453	And you just see little blurbs of what's going on, you know.
2097733	2100255	And they do have voice acting accompanying it.
2100776	2103138	But who plays fighting games for the stories?
2103158	2103338	Right.
2104059	2105280	Who plays fighting games?
2106301	2108904	And I'm going to get emails from angry fighting game fans.
2109584	2110645	I do.
2111065	2116310	But then again, Street Fighter 4 had a really cool story mode and had that little anime thing that went along with it too.
2117151	2119913	So it was actually really immersive and I've always liked the Street Fighter stories.
2120274	2122556	But Soul Calibur 5 gave you comic book and bad acting.
2124289	2127890	Yeah, well, it wasn't that it was bad acting.
2127930	2130210	It just felt kind of cheap.
2131031	2133051	But they do have cutscenes.
2134051	2135392	Well, animated cutscenes.
2135732	2139873	They're kind of few, and you blink and you miss them.
2140313	2146534	But in terms of the fighting portion of the game, I love it.
2146775	2147335	I think it's...
2149075	2151377	I was half thinking when I hit up, I'm gonna jump
2164649	2168511	And so when I didn't, I'm like, oh god, this is 3D, right?
2169992	2171013	I'm not used to that.
2171913	2173854	I'm more used to the 2D fighting style.
2174354	2179217	So it was kind of disorienting for me, but that's just a personal thing.
2179637	2186561	But I really think the graphics and the way the fighting works and everything, you kind of ease into it.
2186601	2190303	And I think that Soul Calibur is kind of user-friendly.
2190803	2200705	When it comes to fighting, I think it's a really good game to be introduced to if you haven't ever done any 3D fighting games before.
2204306	2205546	Was there a tutorial or something?
2206246	2214008	No, there's no... Well, there is a training mode and they kind of hold your hand through combos and all that stuff.
2214488	2215988	But it's just in terms of...
2217094	2219436	I don't know, it just felt really intuitive.
2225581	2231425	Every move that you make feels like a special move because it all has flashy graphics and everything.
2231905	2235788	It's aesthetically pleasing, I guess, is what I'm trying to get at.
2236169	2243214	Now, I know you had a minute to play around with the create your own character mode, which has been a popular part of Soul Calibur since the third one.
2243955	2245816	What did you think of create a character mode?
2247857	2248978	Oh, I love it.
2249098	2251039	I think it's really good.
2251359	2254261	They have a ton of options that you can do.
2255481	2257883	I made a black chick and I named her Rob.
2259076	2259476	Oh, thank you.
2259496	2261017	After you, because you're a black chick.
2261057	2261657	Thank you.
2262317	2262758	Thank you.
2262838	2263058	Yeah.
2263078	2263618	I appreciate it.
2264038	2265179	Yeah.
2265459	2279544	And you can make her special moves have like a little aura and make that aura a color, and I made it purple just for you.
2279564	2280505	Oh, like Tinky Winky.
2280545	2281365	I appreciate that.
2282466	2283206	Oh, no problem.
2283866	2284206	Whatever.
2284246	2284787	I don't get that.
2285167	2285287	But...
2286644	2288044	Yeah, it's really cool.
2289245	2298567	Then I brought it over to my brother-in-laws and he was able to make a character that looks a lot like Cole from what's it, Infamous?
2299827	2304608	And my sister made a character that I can't quite describe.
2304768	2315911	She looks like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica but with like a monk's outfit on and like some kind of
2317102	2317943	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2343732	2347333	No, because the game isn't really out yet.
2348233	2353355	I tried to go online, but it said nobody's playing the game or whatever.
2353415	2355596	It didn't let me connect to anybody.
2356236	2360797	So I didn't really get to experience the online element to the game.
2360877	2364998	But I'm sure that it has a nice user interface.
2365439	2366639	So there's that.
2367379	2367739	Okay.
2369960	2371241	It has a nice interface.
2371421	2372242	I appreciate that.
2372282	2373402	Yeah, exactly.
2373542	2378765	So anything else that the OLR listeners should know about Soul Calibur V before it comes out this week?
2381755	2383997	I think that it's a good game.
2384037	2390203	I mean, if you like fighting games and you like 3D fighting games in particular, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
2390343	2401733	I think that from what I hear, I read a few reviews on it, and they seem to think that it's improved since Soul Calibur 4.
2401793	2403915	I guess there were some little buggy issues that...
2404335	2417598	They say that it's improved on, but they also kind of echo my opinion that the single player story mode is kind of cheap, but whatever.
2418019	2418779	It's a fighting game.
2418799	2420459	You don't play for the story mode.
2420499	2421459	No, you just want to wrestle.
2422140	2423280	That's why we play fighting games.
2423880	2424840	Sometimes you just want to wrestle.
2426161	2426601	Exactly.
2428001	2433484	Well, Extrovert, I gotta let you go so we can get to some gaming news, but thank you for coming on and talking about Soul Calibur 5.
2434204	2435705	What would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?
2438066	2440807	I would give it... Can I do .5?
2441007	2441307	Sure.
2441568	2442228	I'll do 8.5.
2442388	2443849	How about that?
2444029	2444649	Good, good.
2444669	2447510	Because we have to always have that arbitrary score for no particular reason.
2448071	2450272	And quickly, before we let you go, is there anything you want to plug?
2452633	2454254	Uh... Somebody's butt?
2456174	2458659	Well, we hope this show will help you in accomplishing that.
2460042	2460624	Oh, okay.
2460704	2462668	I'm sure this show will help me with that.
2463959	2464960	Alright, bye, Extrofer!
2465780	2466620	Okay, bye.
2494807	2497808	So our local team isn't even in it anyway, so whatever.
2499069	2500349	And yeah, so we'll be here.
2500709	2503590	And throughout, I don't see any weeks off coming up.
2503990	2506831	Do you have any more cheesecake dates, DarkSakura, that I need to be aware of?
2507311	2507532	No.
2508932	2509192	All right.
2511053	2511393	Excuse me.
2511493	2513794	Let's get into some gaming news then.
2513954	2514154	Loki.
2516169	2526217	Alright, let's start off with talking about some ridiculous rumors regarding the Xbox Lube.
2526797	2533883	And, of course, the rumor is that apparently the new system will launch on holiday 2013.
2534263	2543651	And it's going to launch with a new GPU that's going to be put out by ATI or AMD, I guess, at this point.
2544331	2558204	It's, um, I guess part of the AMD 6000 series, um, which is roughly about 20% more performance power than the Wii U, at least what the Wii U is spec'd at right now.
2558925	2562108	And also, um, apparently it is, uh...
2562688	2564970	We're gonna tape two of them together!
2581480	2583481	Call it a Wii.
2583622	2592228	So yeah, it's going to support DirectX or the Radeon HD 6670, which is what this chip is going to be sort of based on.
2592248	2595410	It supports DirectX 11, which is going to look nice.
2596230	2600873	1080p HD multi-display output, 3D, and a bunch of other fun stuff.
2601214	2604656	I mean, and that's what it's assumed as right now, what they're going to be using.
2604676	2607078	I guess they're already manufacturing the chips for it, so...
2609005	2609265	We'll see.
2610006	2614108	I mean, it's all rumors, so we won't know until they officially announce it.
2614648	2617429	Which, they could announce a new systems coming.
2617889	2619950	Do rumors like this really even matter?
2620010	2624233	Because the whole, like, the Xbox will be, whatever it's called, will be more powerful.
2625393	2626174	Duh!
2626194	2627075	It's just all potential.
2627115	2628977	This just basically says potential.
2629017	2631801	I mean, however they use that, it's hard to say.
2631861	2638308	I mean, and even the chips that are in the Xbox 360 right now, compared to today's standards, are not powerful at all.
2638929	2640611	But it's just how they use it.
2641612	2645136	So it's, I mean, it's hard to say what it will look like.
2647478	2648479	I'm sure it'll look nice.
2649220	2655107	But also I think a lot of it has to do with when you put the specs out there then your competition can see it and they know how to one-up you.
2655547	2663717	So one reason I would think that Microsoft may not want to put it out there this year is that they don't want Sony to know what's going in there because then Sony will just do whatever they have to do to one-up it.
2664949	2666150	I can still do that anyways.
2687735	2689057	An inside source.
2689077	2697165	They're going to put the most powerful GPU, CPU that they can in the system and still make it cost effective for the consumer.
2697185	2697926	That's what they're going to do.
2698627	2705273	I mean, they're not going to... They're going to put an old... The Intel, was it?
2705514	2707536	Accelerator Graphics Card 500 or whatever it is.
2709042	2713146	All right, moving on to games that are going to be coming out a lot sooner than whatever the next Xbox is.
2713647	2715188	Resident Evil Revelations.
2715208	2717251	There was a couple news stories going around about it this week.
2717471	2718492	One, the demo is out.
2718612	2725419	I didn't mention it during my gaming week because I don't like to review demos, but I did download the demo for Resident Evil Revelations.
2725819	2731405	I thought it was interesting because on the 3DS, when you download the demo, or at least this one, it says uses left 30.
2732526	2733107	Jumping Flash
2756212	2756753	Really?
2757394	2766028	I played the demo of Jumping Flash for weeks several times a day because it was so freaking fun and I couldn't afford the game at the time.
2766930	2767651	Alan wants to comment.
2768312	2770576	I played the Bayonetta demo at least two dozen times.
2771459	2772200	Final Fantasy VIII Demo
2787663	2790865	I would say maybe the demo for Parappa the Rapper.
2791045	2791325	Yes.
2792126	2793546	I played that a bunch, too.
2793927	2795467	And the Um Jambalami one.
2796268	2796368	Oh.
2796568	2797609	I played that a bunch, too.
2797629	2798329	Okay, okay.
2798609	2802931	Well, anyway, look, I don't think Resident Evil Revelations is going to be one of those games.
2802991	2805413	Maybe, I don't know, maybe for you it will be, whatever.
2805533	2808074	I played it, and I was like, this is kind of neat.
2808154	2810516	I like the 3D effects, and it's cool.
2811116	2812897	It's got that scary...
2813497	2837040	Resident Evil S kind of like the older games had kind of feels a lot more like that but I'm going to be honest what do they want for this game new they wanted what 50 bucks at one point and then they dropped it down to 40 right yes yeah I don't think I don't personally I'm not into the series enough where I can justify 40 bucks I know there are some people that will and that's cool I don't think they're going to be terribly disappointed but uh just you know not so much for me
2837700	2843308	But those that are getting on this game early are going to get something that's a bit of a blessing and a curse.
2843448	2846191	And there's a lot of lulls going around the internet about that this week.
2846232	2847633	I mean, this is on the front page of Yahoo.
2847994	2848454	I saw this.
2848775	2853601	It's the fact that the Resident Evil Revelations box art is spelled wrong.
2854002	2854903	That was the only review caught.
2855243	2855804	on the side.
2856204	2859506	Well, Capcom put out a statement.
2860467	2864350	It has come to our attention that there was a misspelling on the Resident Evil Revelations packaging.
2864730	2868553	We apologize for the mistake, which will be corrected for subsequent productions of the game.
2868933	2872576	It makes it sound like the first printing, because the first printing has to already be out there.
2872876	2873957	It's hitting shelves on the 7th, right?
2873977	2876118	Oh, Capcom, you're so funny with your printing.
2876138	2882383	Remember way back when Okami came out and there was an IGN watermark on it?
2882803	2884824	Oh yeah, oh god, that was funny.
2885485	2889687	They had to recall them all or something, or no, they had to substitute box art.
2890247	2892868	And you know what, I didn't even own the game and I got to substitute box art.
2894629	2896110	Well, they're going to do something similar for this.
2896150	2903034	They are saying that they might actually be, I guess, they're going to work on a solution to provide affected customers with the correct packaging.
2903374	2909317	But in my mind, I'm thinking, the value of the misspelled ones just shot like way up.
2909757	2911538	Nah, you don't think?
2912039	2913640	I beg to differ with Loki.
2914520	2915200	Monopoly.
2916561	2918843	And I'm thinking like baseball cards that are spelled wrong.
2919283	2921144	No, in reference to a game.
2921624	2922285	Monopoly.
2923005	2927908	There was a release of Monopoly on the Sega Master System that had it Monospace Poly.
2928408	2930470	But was that in the game or on the box art?
2930690	2931310	On the box art.
2931570	2932451	On the cartridge.
2933612	2933892	Nice.
2934572	2935733	And it's a collector's item.
2936960	2953193	but here's the thing and this is the only thing I can think of where I do somewhat agree with Loki like I agree with you with the classic stuff but then Loki I'm thinking that stuff is really easy to fake in this day and age with the types of color printers we have you know like how easy would that there's ways around it there are ways to find if it's a fake
2953933	2954173	Okay.
2954794	2960376	Because, okay, first of all, you'd be dealing with the pound of paper that they use.
2961537	2965378	You would be dealing with their print resolutions.
2965999	2979105	You would be dealing with, you can actually sometimes tell what type of printer was used for something just by looking with a, what's it called, a loop at the print itself.
2979125	2979205	Okay.
2979778	2984980	Yeah, Amiga777 in our chatroom says, I hear that eBay is lighting up with high prices for the misspelled ones.
2985320	2987101	Be careful with something like eBay.
2987181	2989942	Just remember, go back a few episodes.
2991263	2998746	Excuse me, Alan got me a birthday present game on eBay that ended up coming from China, and it was the wrong damn game.
2998966	3003768	He bought me Child of Eden, and we ended up getting a copy of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
3005339	3005960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3022117	3048184	I haven't forgotten about you guys and I did have a story here we already mentioned it though because of the four gigabyte cartridge that Resident Evil Revelations uses as opposed to the two gigabyte cartridge they were trying to justify a $50 price tag well that didn't last they did officially drop it to $40 but you may think about well if you want to play it with the Circle Pad Pro you're gonna have to dump an extra $20 on it anyway so it's really not that cheap
3048584	3049085	Oh, cool.
3049145	3049825	I saved myself $60.
3050246	3054710	Would you download it or something?
3055070	3056352	No, I'm just not going to play it.
3056572	3058414	Oh, okay.
3061356	3062157	Anyhow, all right.
3062177	3062898	Let's move on.
3062918	3063819	DarkSakura.
3064537	3067782	Well, I never can pronounce the name of this company, right?
3067822	3070445	Is it Asus or Asus or Asus?
3071527	3071987	Asus?
3072588	3074370	Like Loki's laptop?
3074430	3074771	Asus.
3075051	3075412	Asus.
3076633	3079117	I think most people say Asus, but I like Asus.
3079497	3094412	at any rate, there is a note that there is a PC Connect SKU going to be coming out for an Asus laptop it's going to apparently have a built-in Kinect sensor
3095413	3098616	It's just licensed out by Microsoft.
3099196	3103680	They're not doing the, I guess, the creation of the item itself.
3104561	3109445	But Microsoft did confirm that the laptops are going to have Kinect's functionality built in.
3111767	3117272	And of course, we know the standalone PC Kinect is going to be out on February 1st for $249.
3117312	3117452	Yeah.
3118709	3119329	I'm not surprised.
3119889	3123170	I think they already said that they're going to be trying to integrate that in the PCs.
3123230	3124031	I mean, it makes sense.
3124251	3128232	You're not going to have just a separate Kinect sensor that's going to be separate from the laptop.
3128512	3129532	Of course, it's going to be integrated.
3129792	3130273	It makes sense.
3130553	3136014	See, honestly, something like that would be great for me when too much typing starts to hurt after a while.
3137135	3137975	You know, air type.
3138475	3139495	That would just be pretty awesome.
3141136	3141316	But...
3142904	3148726	I mean, I guess for a laptop, I don't know how it would make as much sense as having something like that for a PC.
3149106	3154027	Because, you know, a lot of people do PC gaming and we have a PC hooked up to our TV in the front room.
3154928	3156308	Something like that would be a good idea.
3156368	3161970	I just don't see exactly how it would work for a laptop unless it's for like virtual keyboard and disabled services.
3163230	3163310	So...
3165143	3177331	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of funny, the Wii U getting a brand new network to go along with it, which is good.
3177551	3187098	I mean, because right now what they've got for, I don't even know what you really call it, was it Wi-Fi Connect or something like that, which...
3187478	3188619	Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection
3208610	3215014	This was kind of leaked out a little bit early with the new Final Fantasy The Rhythm cover.
3215054	3216514	It actually had that logo on there.
3217175	3222858	And then, of course, Nintendo was talking a little bit about it as part of an investor presentation.
3223458	3228921	And some of the things that are going to be coming with the Nintendo Network, communities of Mario Kart 7 players.
3229221	3231302	So they're going to have some sort of community feature with that.
3231322	3233143	Well, Mario Kart 7 already has communities in it.
3233403	3234644	So are they expanding that?
3234884	3235845	RockBand has DLC.
3260845	3264849	Yeah, for the Wii, but not like on the 3DS and the DS and stuff like that.
3265209	3265810	Alright, whatever.
3266010	3266270	Alright.
3266530	3266811	Okay.
3267792	3270875	Preparing for digital distribution of packaged software.
3271735	3275099	So, I mean, they're going to have some downloadable games, I guess.
3275819	3282105	And the introduction of personal accounts for the Wii U. Which, in my opinion, is the only actual new news in here.
3282505	3282746	Yeah.
3285165	3290888	Yes, I understand that now Nintendo is saying they can sell full games online or whatever, but virtual console is full games.
3290908	3293290	The 3DS shot is just bigger full games.
3293430	3295972	Fantastic that you can sell full games online.
3296672	3299974	Welcome to 10 years ago for everybody else.
3300055	3301195	I mean, it's like, come on.
3301435	3303197	Where the fuck have you been, Nintendo?
3303917	3309679	But yay for them finally catching up because I would like to see a Nintendo console that understands online.
3310340	3311360	So that would be nice.
3312881	3323045	But yeah, the fact that they are finally doing this whole personal accounts and maybe that means no more friend code, I hope.
3323385	3323765	We'll see.
3326078	3326778	I would hope not.
3327619	3329060	I don't like friend codes, sir.
3329520	3329980	Who does?
3330100	3331641	Does anyone like friend codes?
3331761	3332902	I don't like friends.
3334683	3335003	No.
3336884	3338785	It was an overrated TV show, I agree.
3339586	3341047	I really don't like that show.
3342768	3347671	Except I always liked when What's-Her-Face's hair would frizz out because it totally reminded me of going back to Alabama.
3350470	3352271	Alright, so Nintendo Network.
3352832	3356595	I know we've had investor information, but when do we get the real information?
3356615	3358116	Have they said anything about that or no?
3358176	3358376	Nope.
3359477	3359857	Soon.
3361038	3361439	E3, right?
3362039	3362660	Probably.
3363140	3364121	Hey, guess what, guys?
3364141	3366603	We have this wonderful technology that we're going to implement.
3366623	3369665	It's called patching our games.
3371286	3372587	Downloadable content.
3372827	3376971	It's like getting a new game, but you're downloading extra pieces.
3377711	3379313	Now I know this is totally revolutionary.
3379453	3384137	And you only have to pay 100 Mario coins to unlock the online features.
3385919	3389022	This thing that we're going to call the Wi-Fi Pass.
3391946	3395207	You need to play... The play is Luigi.
3395908	3399429	No, they should really... I think that the online... Are you too lazy to walk?
3399609	3403571	Do you need to buy extra play coins so you can unlock stationary and swap notes?
3403591	3405652	That's DLC Quest.
3406112	3406792	Watch it happen.
3407032	3407893	DLC Quest.
3407913	3410454	The first DLC you buy is the ability to walk left.
3412162	3413083	and Animations.
3414024	3419329	And then I love it, the sexy outfit DLC that you can get in DLC Quest.
3419509	3421991	Add sexy outfits to everybody in the game.
3422392	3423553	So bikinis all around.
3424213	3424454	Fun.
3424554	3424974	Good times.
3426215	3428678	Alright, well let's move on and talk about Gaikai.
3428798	3433082	You know, Gaikai is one of those online streaming networks, kind of like OnLive and so forth.
3433742	3443071	Guy Kai is going to be doing full game streaming services on the various gaming and entertainment websites that they will be working with.
3443172	3444853	Now, right now, they only do demos.
3444913	3445654	That's the difference.
3445714	3449838	Right now, Guy Kai specializes in demos, but they are going to be doing full game streaming services.
3450318	3451079	Now, here's the thing.
3451219	3456925	One of those partners involved is Facebook, which if you might have heard of it, it's a pretty popular website.
3457965	3465149	Also, Gaikai is supposed to be doing stuff with YouTube, Best Buy, Walmart, and even directly with the publishers, EA and Ubisoft.
3465649	3471652	Full game streaming is supposed to go about 90 days after the Facebook version begins, which is going to be very soon.
3472132	3485878	Gaikai does compete with OnLive, but the folks behind Gaikai, including the head Dave Perry, says that one of the big differences between the two companies is they have to modify the game, they have to get the source code to the game, Gaikai does not require modification of the game.
3486178	3486579	So, very interesting.
3502738	3504539	That could be integrated with Facebook soon.
3505279	3508520	Especially because Facebook games are still kind of a big thing.
3508540	3509720	There's a lot that people play.
3510160	3512121	I've heard that a lot of them are dying.
3512861	3515982	There's not nearly as many farmers in Farmville as there were some time ago.
3516022	3522064	But I will admit, as terrible as they are, I can't stop playing the Press Your Luck.
3522104	3524525	There's a new Press Your Luck game on Facebook.
3525245	3525465	DarkSakura
3539744	3540565	I'm judging you, Rob.
3557967	3558488	Oh, God.
3558588	3563611	And I got really tired of block.
3564031	3565272	They try too much.
3566012	3571375	A lot of those Facebook games try way too hard to get your money.
3571435	3575098	If they wanted to be smart, they would actually look at Tiny Tower.
3575758	3578099	I think it's a lot more subtle about it.
3578179	3583502	Certainly, it's there, and they're not shy about it, but it's not in your face all the freaking time.
3584323	3585143	So, it's just...
3586284	3589129	Plus the game show games that I play kind of do that too.
3589209	3592294	I play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire as well and it's like you are out of shows.
3592334	3593957	Do you want to buy more shows for the day?
3595760	3597743	But I don't need to play more than once a day.
3598644	3598965	I don't know.
3599406	3599866	That's just me.
3601641	3629731	so it would be interesting though if like full on streaming games more powerful stuff was coming to Facebook like cause some of the you know especially games like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and Press Your Luck and the stuff I'm playing don't really have that great animations and SimSocial for like the week I was playing it before I blocked it you know the animation's kinda old but imagine if they could have a game like SimSocial with Sims 3 graphical quality to it that actually ran pretty smoothly Gaikai could bring that couldn't it?
3631198	3631538	Maybe?
3631639	3640928	I mean, I know we're talking about streaming, I don't know, Arkham City and things that are already out there on the PC and stuff, but couldn't Facebook games be developed with this in mind?
3640968	3641849	That'd be very interesting.
3642950	3644632	So, anyhow.
3645352	3646493	Well, anything is possible.
3646934	3647334	That's true.
3647474	3648035	All right, moving on.
3648796	3653901	Well, Quarrel Xbox Live Arcade found what the filter is.
3655521	3657862	Coral is one of those word games.
3659063	3666626	And if you play it with the parental filters on, there are a bunch of words that you can't play.
3667446	3675330	On the list is help, train, start, dice, and god.
3675550	3677431	Of course, balls and shaft are not allowed.
3678971	3682633	And then the offensive words are not allowed, like arse, shit.
3684209	3684489	Fuck.
3685410	3685770	Cock.
3685951	3688573	But now I heard that see you next Tuesday was allowed.
3689073	3690414	Somehow was slipping through.
3694258	3695839	Whereas all these other words are blocked.
3697321	3699883	The mother of all curse words is not.
3700464	3700964	The source.
3703546	3706729	Literally, the source of all your cursing.
3708370	3708990	You can say it.
3711152	3713233	You know, I actually don't like that word, but it is a funny word.
3713633	3714114	What, cunt?
3714394	3718837	Yeah.
3719538	3723521	There's basically the other words that...
3726095	3728137	Well, I cunt understand what the problem is.
3728377	3732781	In other words, it's not allowed to skid and poop and bung and hung and dice.
3734323	3734783	Oh, great.
3735063	3736945	Now it's sounding like Extifer's back on the show.
3738166	3739387	Bleached asshole.
3740789	3743932	I was going to suggest that to him for that little issue he posted about
3744572	3744652	Help!
3744672	3745073	Help!
3745233	3745713	And Hung!
3745853	3745993	Huh.
3766989	3768510	You can't talk about having to poop.
3770010	3771871	You can't start anything.
3773832	3775673	You can't roll the dice.
3776053	3782095	Gamers are discriminating against tabletop gamers because they don't let dice.
3782635	3783476	I'm offended.
3784316	3786717	They are discriminating against my people.
3788373	3791554	But here, this is the, okay, to me, this is the hilarious thing about this story.
3791854	3792355	And trains.
3792615	3795776	So we find, hey, my dad was a conductor for the railroad.
3795796	3796516	That's offensive.
3796696	3797437	That is offensive.
3797557	3799137	You can't say train on Xbox Live Arcade.
3799257	3808301	But yet, this is the hilarious thing to me, is that Microsoft bans all these words for whatever reason, like maybe, I don't know, whatever.
3808941	3809502	They're banned.
3809602	3812283	Listen, the Xbox 360 does not start.
3812583	3817205	All I have to do is turn on my headset.
3818436	3823860	and all I'll hear on Xbox Live while I'm probably playing Quarrel, Nice word, fag.
3825001	3826142	This game is gay.
3826382	3828664	Why are you playing this faggy gay game?
3829465	3831947	Because I saw the game blowing some guy in the backyard.
3831987	3834629	Well, you're playing this game too.
3836010	3837311	Nice move, fag.
3837331	3841154	Ain't you playing better words?
3841174	3844197	The quote from Gary Penn with Denki, the developer,
3845458	3854369	Coral uses the Collins Official Scrabble Dictionary comprising over 110,000 words up to 8 letters in length including a huge collection of words deemed offensive
3865913	3867294	It's a really shitty band.
3868796	3870158	It's a really shitty band.
3870558	3874343	Unless you're, you know, maybe it's a sex move or something.
3874443	3874964	The train.
3874984	3875965	Choo-choo.
3875985	3878368	It's a move and fisting.
3878388	3879569	You don't know what a train is?
3879970	3880150	No.
3881673	3882754	Rob's looking it up, too.
3882774	3886316	Wait, you're talking about the human centipede stuff, aren't you?
3886336	3886936	No, no, no.
3887156	3888857	My friend just bought that movie.
3889778	3890939	She loves that movie.
3891419	3892620	Something to that effect.
3892920	3895341	Yes, a train is something to that effect.
3896242	3899444	Except maybe not sewing someone's ass to their face.
3900384	3901685	Yeah.
3901825	3902286	Oh, my God.
3903146	3907209	Microsoft has forced Dance Central to remove one of their songs.
3907309	3908129	I can't believe it.
3908549	3910731	This song is deemed way too offensive.
3918887	3920488	She fucking said train.
3920528	3922369	That's offensive.
3922509	3923590	Ride the train?
3923850	3928292	You know that's a euphemism for big fat cock.
3928772	3929613	Listen to her.
3929633	3931514	She's all, come on, ride the big fat cock.
3938277	3939818	Lord.
3940258	3943380	See, I was thinking it was maybe a euphemism for fisting.
3946576	3951080	Rob just turned red.
3951101	3952962	Who are you having sex with, Muppets?
3955885	3956826	Gosh, okay.
3957427	3961611	Allow me to enlighten you to what a train is.
3965288	3975417	A group of guys stand in line outside of a room one by one and they enter a room to have sex with one girl inside.
3975517	3979701	The line must have at least seven guys to be qualified as a train.
3979881	3980722	That is a train.
3980742	3981482	What does that make her?
3981542	3982063	The caboose?
3987165	3991106	Well, now we understand why the game has banned the word train.
3991606	3993107	Orange Sons Radio got that word banned.
3993127	3993707	Thank you very much.
3994167	3994427	All right.
3995767	3996127	Anyhow.
3996407	3996548	Or.
3997168	3997348	Or.
3997528	3997828	You know what?
3997928	3998588	I'm leaving the room.
3998608	3999288	You guys are dirty.
3999908	4003449	Or it would be a line of men having intercourse connected by penis to ass.
4009326	4020250	The conductor or man in the back controls the speed while the front controls the direction of the train.
4020871	4023351	As one ejaculates, he will then exit the train.
4023772	4025712	We involve train sounds.
4026193	4027213	Is it kind of like this?
4027373	4027873	I'm not sure.
4027893	4032415	S to S. S to S.
4034278	4035618	What the hell is... Ass to Ass.
4035658	4036419	Requiem for a Dream.
4036719	4036819	Oh.
4037839	4038579	Ass to Ass.
4040080	4040300	Alright.
4040580	4040920	Anyways.
4041420	4042421	Thank you, Urban Dictionary.
4042441	4042941	You're welcome.
4043021	4043301	Alright.
4044501	4046582	I like how I said you're welcome as if I'm Urban Dictionary.
4046862	4047722	Alright, let's move on.
4047762	4049583	Let's stop being 12 and move on to...
4051505	4057287	Travel around the world and check out what the trains bring into a game store near you as we look at some release dates.
4057567	4058928	Lots of good stuff this week, actually.
4059288	4063109	The only releases for this month that are worth picking up.
4063189	4066990	Final Fantasy XIII 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4067190	4072052	Also in a collector's edition if you want to buy the game with the...
4072512	4075874	Soul Calibur V on PS3 and Xbox 360 Never Dead on PS3 and Xbox 360
4092671	4093372	And that's actually it.
4094713	4096014	And then nothing.
4096275	4096735	There you go.
4096995	4105364	I thought we might add, there was, I think at one point there was Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 3D for the 3DS, but that's been delayed again.
4105624	4106085	I see.
4106105	4107466	3D balls were considered offensive.
4109108	4110690	It took extra time to render the balls.
4110870	4111110	All right.
4113112	4116173	They had to pay special attention to the balls.
4117154	4118775	Or else somebody might get offended.
4119235	4119835	Alright, moving on.
4119855	4121536	Let's check out what's coming out in Japan.
4121576	4123017	We'll start with the Xbox 360.
4123057	4124637	Japan finally gets Dragon Age 2.
4125678	4127659	So you can say meh just like the rest of us.
4127779	4131741	On February 2nd, 2012 is when Dragon Age 2 finally gets to Japan.
4131801	4140405	Also coming to Japan on February 2nd, Never Dead and Soul Calibur V obviously is released here this week and it looks like it's timed pretty well to actually be released in Japan at the same time.
4141045	4164163	Coming to the PlayStation 3, a lot of the same stuff, Dragon Age 2, Never Dead, Soul Calibur V But you also get Gran Turismo 5 Spec 2012 I'm not sure exactly what this is, but I want to say this is probably similar I think you were talking about this on the show, Loki They were going to put out a Gran Turismo 5 that came with a bunch of download content It came with $20 worth of download content and the Spec 2012 update
4165564	4169507	They are saying that this new update does the simplified cockpit view.
4169747	4171949	It's a spec 2012 update.
4171969	4173150	They're just calling something different in there.
4173330	4173931	Alright, got it.
4174051	4175192	So that's what Japan is getting.
4175212	4176633	Spec 2.0 is what they're calling it.
4177113	4178294	So Japan gets that, hooray.
4178915	4183999	The Vita is out in Japan, and out this week on the Vita is Ragnarok Odyssey.
4184339	4189824	Comes out from Gung Ho, and I believe, if I'm not mistaken, this is the Ragnarok online game on the Vita, I think.
4192346	4193867	Although I don't know if it's specific...
4195490	4196550	Oh no, I think this is different.
4196590	4199731	Ragnarok Odyssey pits gamers against giants from Norse myths.
4200451	4202452	So I don't think that's it, but it's like more of an action game.
4202812	4204893	I saw the name and I thought maybe, maybe.
4205533	4205813	All right.
4207973	4208273	Anyhow.
4211354	4211814	Let's see.
4212495	4214395	Coming out on other systems.
4215595	4216235	Like a train.
4218136	4219276	That's just never going to die.
4219856	4221637	I'm trying to see if anything's coming out on the Wii.
4223980	4226102	It's coming out.
4226122	4229664	On the 3DS, Fishing 3D from D3.
4229844	4231145	Ooh, Fishing 3D.
4232026	4234007	It's almost like the real thing, just as boring.
4234968	4237029	And lastly, that's it.
4238755	4240257	I guess I could check the PSP real quick.
4241078	4241518	How about it?
4241538	4242039	Photo Kano.
4242760	4243000	Okay.
4244121	4248487	On the 30th in the UK, January 30th, we have Call of Cthulhu, The Wasted Land.
4249688	4250509	Call of Cthulhu.
4251871	4254634	And now I have to go to February because this thing's set up really bizarre.
4257356	4273423	and in February on the 1st we have Rhythm Party on the 2nd we have Pixel Junk Eden and on the 3rd Final Fantasy 13-2 Metal Gear Solid HD Collection Never Dead and Soul Calibur V
4276590	4282512	Shane knows a lot about the Vita and what's going on and says that Ragnarok Odyssey is partially the people that did Ragnarok Online.
4282692	4288254	So it's not Ragnarok Online, but it's like a lot of the same people making a new thing.
4288834	4289634	So there you go.
4290695	4291435	Just thought you'd want to know.
4291455	4296437	All right, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.
4296657	4297897	So let's go to Loki.
4298717	4303219	It's like Ragnarok Wi-Fi ad hoc.
4305251	4306633	Yes, it's just like that.
4307594	4310036	With a 3G connection provided by AT&T, yes.
4310597	4310857	Yes.
4311017	4314141	Well, in Japan, it would be something else.
4314341	4319006	So, yeah, the Vita's getting hacked, as usual.
4320227	4322629	But it's not exactly the Vita getting hacked.
4322669	4326554	It's more of the PlayStation 3 getting hacked and the Vita kind of benefiting from said hack.
4327334	4339778	Of course, with the power of custom firmwares on the PlayStation 3, and this has been something that they did with the PSP before, where they added more games supported through remote play.
4340338	4341978	They have done the same with the Vita.
4342078	4353322	Now you can support more games via remote play on the Vita, including Batman Arkham Asylum, Battlefield 3, Alice in Madness Returns, Mortal Kombat, and Red Dead Redemption.
4355023	4357964	However, the games display a hefty amount of input lag.
4358464	4370070	Also, they had some extra games that they're going to be supporting via remote play, including Killzone 3, but those are not yet available.
4371482	4398380	I guess not yet supported but it looks like if I remember correctly the PSP there were a lot of games that didn't have remote play enabled but with hacks were able to get remote play enabled on those and they actually worked just fine so there may be more games beyond just those five that they will work and work well so they have videos online too if you want to
4399020	4422133	check them out um I mean I think it'd be pretty awesome play Battlefield 3 on the Vita or you know Red Dead I didn't even think about that the PSP and the PlayStation 3 already have similar connectivity you know yes it's one of the most underlooked features in the PSP so the Vita ought to kick it up and you should be able to play like PS3 games streaming right yes and especially since the controls will be nice instead of having to worry about before we're
4422313	4423894	Oh, I only have one analog stick.
4423954	4425114	Now you have dual analog.
4425394	4434559	And to be honest, they should be supporting the L2R2 just by tapping a portion of the back touch panel.
4435259	4440561	And then you have pretty much full compatibility with the dual shock controls.
4442542	4448765	Assuming that you're not going to run into input lag that's going to really affect your game, I don't see why more games aren't supporting this.
4451457	4463835	Alright, well, I'm hoping to see more of this kind of technology coming to the Vita, because I gotta say, if I could play, like, Final Fantasy XIII too, on my Vita, like, while I'm in bed, like, you know, just do a little bit of the grinding in my bedroom...
4467048	4469150	I meant experience grinding, you sick perv.
4469210	4470812	Stop laughing over there, DarkSakura.
4471072	4472773	You certainly are experienced, huh?
4473774	4474014	Bitch.
4474035	4474635	All right.
4475316	4477658	Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.
4477738	4478559	I would love to do that.
4478599	4479840	Like, that would be so awesome.
4480140	4481682	Like, it's almost like a... I mean...
4483324	4487887	Isn't the Wii U's whole point kind of moot if the PlayStation can do that same thing?
4489067	4489508	Sort of.
4489688	4493050	Sort of, except for the fact that it would be way more expensive on the PlayStation 3, I'm sure.
4495651	4497592	Alpha Cananagram wants to make a good point, though.
4497692	4502595	The thing is, PS3 is Wi-Fi G, not Wi-Fi N, so it's going to suck.
4504358	4512086	Yes, but at the same time, who's to say the next system's not going to be... I'd assume the next system's going to be Wi-Fi in.
4512166	4513487	Are you already thinking about Vita 2?
4514388	4517972	No, I'm talking about the... Oh, I'm sorry, the PS3.
4517992	4519193	That's a good point.
4519213	4520514	I don't know if the Vita is in.
4521035	4521756	I think it might be.
4523075	4523776	It just occurred to me.
4524596	4526158	There's another game that I played today.
4527479	4529121	But we're bringing it up.
4529661	4530842	I played with the Sony tablet.
4531703	4533084	Oh?
4533845	4535046	Was it called the Tablet S?
4536447	4538069	And it has PlayStation games on it.
4538609	4540551	But I was playing the Uncharted pinball game today.
4541312	4541492	Oh, okay.
4541972	4562385	But I was thinking about that, you know, if they've got PlayStation, I think it said some PS2 games too on their little tablet, then it actually seems to, you know, that it wouldn't be that hard for them to have the Vita that played, you know, your PS3 games.
4562887	4564708	Alpha Cananigram has another great suggestion here.
4564768	4576913	They need to release an updated PS3 or some sort of dongle to upgrade the Wi-Fi N for the Vita's Wi-Fi N. And Dongle, he's changed his name, is confirming the Vita does have an N in it.
4577814	4582436	To be honest, you could do that with a Wi-Fi N bridge.
4583176	4584817	You could, you know...
4586138	4595464	Upgrade your connection or have a router that's Wi-Fi and connect physically to your PS3 and then have it stream from there.
4596745	4603150	Next system, obviously going to be N. Probably will be able to support a lot more streaming, especially if you're going to be downloading games and stuff.
4603170	4604010	That could be kind of cool.
4604311	4606953	You could see a lot of new functionality with the Vita with that.
4609154	4612416	Although by the time that system comes out, the Vita could be dead in the water already.
4613957	4614538	Let's hope not.
4616354	4624617	Alright, well let's move on to another story here I have on THQ, of course the makers of Saints Row, right?
4625978	4628359	Apparently it's going to be refocusing a bit over THQ.
4628439	4633241	First, I should say this, there were some crazy ass rumors this week that THQ was going to just fucking fold.
4633661	4634362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4662463	4664224	and somebody else will pick up the license, I'm sure.
4664664	4671368	But anyway, UFC, Darksiders, Company of Heroes, Insane, Saints Row, Warhammer 40K and so on.
4671388	4674750	These are all still in production and there will be that going forward.
4674770	4676751	They have a ton of fucking titles coming out.
4676811	4681454	I mean, I'm not surprised that they're... I mean, look at the titles that are coming out from THQ.
4681734	4684955	They have the fucking South Park RPG game that's coming out at the end of the year.
4685016	4685256	I mean...
4686116	4688297	They've got plenty of big titles.
4688317	4692179	They're on par with EA and Activision.
4692659	4694240	They're easily one of the top three.
4695440	4700143	Hell, even First Party can't really top... First Party doesn't have a lot of titles coming out anymore.
4701403	4702904	Yeah, they're not going anywhere.
4702924	4709386	I mean, if you're going to see another company die, it's going to be like Konami or maybe even like Capcom.
4710026	4711606	One of the smaller guys like D3.
4712887	4713967	I could see them folding.
4714567	4717468	South Peak, they could have very well already folded.
4719409	4720269	Yeah, it's going to be one of those.
4720329	4721650	It's not going to be THQ.
4721790	4723591	They're not going to just all of a sudden get bought out.
4723751	4724751	They've got a ton of properties.
4725731	4726492	Thanks for watching!
4745449	4747430	I thought one of those tablets did quite well.
4747810	4750852	Was that the first you draw on the Wii?
4751152	4754234	But then when they tried to kind of put it everywhere, it didn't do so well, right?
4754274	4755474	And I don't really know if it did well.
4755514	4756135	It did all right.
4756535	4759696	But I'm glad that it's gone because it had potential.
4759756	4764459	But the problem with that tablet is you didn't have anybody coming on it.
4764859	4768600	They were saying, oh yeah, Nintendo's going to develop some titles for the UDraw tablet.
4768900	4771841	If they had done that, then yeah, I would have kicked ass on the Wii.
4772342	4778123	But since there wasn't a Mario Paint or anything like that on the UDraw, it just died.
4778744	4779284	No one cares.
4779564	4782565	Because it's a peripheral that's going to be used for a couple of games, and that's it.
4784335	4792818	Alright, well, let's take a minute to go down memory lane and think about a time when we weren't so worried about games' financial situations.
4792858	4797739	We didn't have these tablet things that were coming out and destroying game companies.
4799180	4800680	It's the classic game of the week.
4800740	4808502	DarkSakura's gonna dive headfirst into the classic gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey, you kids, better respect.
4809363	4811603	And you picked a real oldie but goodie tonight, didn't you?
4811703	4813044	I picked one of my favorite old games.
4813737	4813997	All right.
4814037	4817100	And you think after... How many episodes have you done of the Classic Game of the Week now?
4817140	4818782	It started episode 250, right?
4818802	4821064	So damn near 200 Classic Games of the Week.
4821404	4821805	Yeah.
4822065	4826689	And you're still finding ones you kind of forgot or whatever, just never did before.
4826989	4832174	Well, and actually this came last night from Dan and I. We were watching...
4834435	4837636	I didn't know it stood for anything.
4853323	4855145	is the portmanteau of excellence in dynamics.
4855966	4856406	I didn't know that.
4856786	4857927	I remember the name Exidy, though.
4858328	4859529	Yeah.
4859549	4862632	So maybe it's Exidi, since it's dynamics.
4862732	4868277	Anyway, Mousetrap was basically, and everyone's going to say it was a Pac-Man clone.
4869078	4877405	Well, unlike Zynga, Exidy decided to actually innovate on the genre and throw in a few other twists.
4878366	4879768	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4894624	4905366	So moving forward, you play as a mouse, and you're being chased by cats, and you are eating up little pieces of cheese, and you can collect bones.
4905847	4914028	Now, the bones, as opposed to how the power pills worked, you store up your bones, and you activate them at a certain time that you choose.
4914528	4917069	You can save all of your bones and not use them in that level.
4917529	4921690	I mean, you have to start over the next level, but still, you don't have to use all your bones.
4922350	4930032	But you have the bones, you turn into a dog, and the dog bites the cats and sends the cats back into their little places that aren't in the center of the screen.
4930072	4933253	They are on each side of the screen.
4934773	4942436	In the center, you have a little area that says, N. And when you go through the N, it actually puts you into one of the four corners at random.
4942476	4943336	You don't get to control.
4944396	4950918	Actually, I think there was a way to determine which one, but I think it depended on how you entered the little thing.
4951818	4959363	So, um... You, uh... Actually, instead of there being four enemies on screen, you had six cats.
4960483	4964766	And they had point multipliers, 100 for the first, 300 for the second, 500 for the third, 700, 900, and that was it.
4964786	4964826	Um...
4971940	4973702	and, of course, it resets every time you use a new bone.
4976063	4978786	Now, the cats, though, will respawn faster.
4979426	4996220	As you got through later levels, you also had a hawk that would pop up that would eat both the mouse and the dog, if you were the dog, and the only way to change its direction from going right after you was to go in the infield in the center so that it would just go to a random place.
4996960	5002406	You also had bonus items that when you got one, the next one would appear.
5002526	5005809	And your bonus items, they would also be towards the different corners.
5006790	5011315	There are 1,000 points each and would increase by 200 points for each subsequent prize.
5011355	5012176	So the last one was 7,200 points.
5013697	5039873	The items are, there's 32 of them, there's a wedge of Swiss cheese, a paperclip, a safety pin, a key, an apple, a trophy, a candlestick, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, a pair of eyeglasses, a clock, a bottle, a gem, a bugle, a screw, a hammer, a diamond ring, a lightbulb, a sewing needle, a fork, a thimble, a knife, a cocktail glass, a fishbone, a pear, a peanut, a die, a telephone handset, a die with CAF on the faces, I guess that would be like a block, a
5040653	5042394	A spool of thread, a teacup, and a pistol.
5042615	5044015	What a mouse needs a pistol for.
5044596	5046437	And a martini glass and eyeglasses.
5046557	5047978	I have no freaking clue.
5047998	5051480	Some of the 80s games had the strangest power-ups in them, though.
5051540	5051801	I know.
5052481	5056464	You also get a 10,000 point bonus for clearing the board of all cheese.
5057124	5062408	And if you end the stage as the dog, you will begin the next stage as the dog.
5062668	5064929	Which is kind of stupid because the cats don't really appear.
5065290	5068852	Now here is, I think, the really innovative part of the game.
5069392	5069973	Are the doors.
5071234	5084556	and with the doors you had three different colors you had a yellow a red and a blue door that if you press that colored button the door would open and close and my goal every time I played the damn game was to trap the cats
5085802	5086383	DarkSakura.com
5101002	5104544	Now, this is not to be confused, as some people are saying in the chat room here.
5104564	5105184	It's a board game.
5105224	5107245	Yes, Torment is saying, my mom loved that game.
5107285	5109426	She would set up for hours playing Mousetrap.
5109666	5111247	But there was somebody else that says it before that.
5111267	5112448	Torment didn't just come out and say that.
5112488	5116970	Somebody said something about the board game in there.
5117620	5120603	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5137296	5138737	and, oh, I can take my time.
5139537	5140318	Look at you, mouses.
5140538	5143660	I mean, kitty cats trapped in the little areas.
5144020	5144860	So there were different ports.
5145101	5152105	Like I said, I had the Clicovision version, which to me was the most true version, I think.
5153265	5179071	it had fewer prizes and you could actually had an option to leave out the hawk and the sound effects were a little different but as far as having the doors and everything it was probably the closest to the arcade you could get the Intellivision one actually added an audio warning when the cats were entering the maze but the graphics were blockier and then the Atari 2600 version
5180891	5183075	I'm looking at the videos now because I want to say I played this one.
5183135	5183435	And no sound.
5195427	5196628	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5211443	5211983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5233851	5237313	However, now you remember the song Pac-Man Fever, Rob?
5238434	5238954	Of course I do.
5239314	5240715	Pac-Man Fever.
5241235	5242256	Bugner and Garcia.
5242716	5246218	Well, they also did a song called Mousetrap on the same album.
5248019	5248539	I did not know that.
5248559	5251321	And it was made using the sound effects from the game.
5252841	5259425	A little note on here from the article I'm reading is that when they re-recorded the album in 1999, they could not find the machine.
5260005	5261686	And so had to use sounds from nature.
5263973	5267416	Let's see, I actually found it here on the good old YouTube that has everything.
5268436	5272439	Mousetrap, mousetrap What can I do?
5275982	5285008	I could turn into a dog if I only had a bone And compress a doggy butt and they would leave me all alone Wow, they do really just sing about the game, don't they?
5285629	5286870	Well, they do with Pac-Man Fever.
5286910	5290792	I could block and trap the cats and turn into a mouse again Mousetrap
5292392	5293212	Rest in peace, by the way.
5293232	5294113	That guy died last year.
5296693	5296953	One of them.
5296993	5297674	There was two of the guys.
5297734	5298414	One of them died last year.
5299014	5299274	Anyhow.
5299714	5301375	But so that's the game.
5301755	5304176	And again, it was one of my all-time favorites.
5304276	5309758	And my mother would sit and play this for hours, although her game was Space Fury.
5310638	5310958	All right.
5311755	5317898	Classic Game of the Week, folks, is Mousetrap for the ColecoVision or, you know, really it did start in the arcade, so there it is.
5317959	5322761	I'm going to say if you want to play it at home without MAME, ColecoVision.
5322941	5323802	All right, that's the way to go.
5324142	5325483	All right, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week.
5325883	5326463	We're going to be back.
5326483	5328004	There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5328024	5329045	We have a list list tonight.
5329085	5330145	We're going to be doing a list list.
5330406	5333087	Tonight's list list is inspired by Twitter.
5333407	5337349	There was a listener on Twitter that said you should do this as a topic, and I'm like, okay, we can do that.
5337369	5338470	So we are going to do a list list.
5338830	5339831	Alan's going to join us for that.
5340331	5343374	and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5366121	5369022	Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5369082	5374704	We are live on January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.
5374764	5377705	You know, if you've never listened to Orange Lounge Radio live, you really should consider it sometime.
5378665	5386388	Of course, I know some of our listeners are overseas, so if you guys are in Europe, it is really hard to listen to our show unless you have severe insomnia.
5386428	5388668	So I apologize for that, but that is why we have a podcast.
5389188	5390769	But for those of you guys who are in the States...
5391209	5393452	Your excuses are severely numbered.
5393812	5398797	So we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, of course.
5398817	5399758	And we do have the chat room.
5400159	5404563	And when you're not here with us in live chat, you miss fun things like DarkSakura's having a contest right now.
5405044	5407627	Whoever can guess her bra size gets to buy her a taco.
5407707	5413313	Now, I'm not sure how there's a winner in that situation.
5414969	5416430	There's two winners and they're both me.
5417331	5420114	Because everyone gets to know what a fantastic rack I have.
5420815	5421896	And I also get a taco.
5421916	5423678	Can I just put pics on OLR.com?
5423698	5423738	No.
5423758	5428002	And then I am kind of wearing a cleavage-y shirt today.
5428182	5429964	Orangeloungeradio.com, actually.
5430004	5430945	I keep saying OLR.com.
5430965	5431966	And my hair is cute.
5431986	5432667	That's not our site.
5432707	5432887	What?
5432967	5433848	And my hair is cute.
5434068	5434809	You do look cute today.
5434969	5454180	I put effort into my hair today considering how like shitty I felt mad you were I don't know yeah angsty you were earlier you A you seem like the show has helped you unwind a little bit yes you might be in a bad mood but you're looking good oh yeah yeah pissy bitch gotta be hot alright
5457859	5459701	All right, we're going to do some rapid-fire news.
5459721	5462763	Believe it or not, we're not just a video game show about boobies.
5462843	5463564	Although, don't get me wrong.
5464144	5465405	Everybody loves boobies.
5465585	5466466	Loki, boobies?
5468107	5469388	He gave the big thumbs up.
5469769	5470489	Great radio.
5471210	5472111	DarkSakura, boobies?
5473352	5473632	Yeah.
5473892	5475273	And I love boobies, too.
5475694	5476274	Boobies are great.
5477055	5478516	Is DarkSakura taking a picture of her boobies?
5479437	5481418	I'm not going to put a picture up.
5482739	5483019	Oh, okay.
5483340	5485221	That kind of comes with the radio show territory.
5485522	5485742	What?
5486042	5487003	Taking pictures of boobs.
5489051	5493135	It's just, you know, you eventually devolve into that type of show.
5493315	5495177	There's the picture.
5495297	5495577	Oh, see?
5495697	5496878	You gotta put that on the site.
5496898	5498159	I am.
5499641	5500381	Alright, moving on.
5500401	5502343	Alright.
5503164	5506067	Let's talk about Skylanders.
5506207	5506927	Yay, Skylanders.
5506947	5507788	Your favorite game.
5507828	5509029	My favorite game.
5509129	5509910	Hey, you know what?
5511001	5513002	Here's the thing.
5513242	5516523	If you can't avoid them, then at least benefit from them.
5517563	5518543	But that's another story.
5519043	5520204	Anyways, Skylanders.
5520244	5526345	So apparently Activision has grabbed the rights to a domain called Skylanders Giants.
5526465	5530987	So you can probably guess that's probably going to be the next Skylander game or whatever.
5531607	5535388	So Skylander Giants coming to a store near you.
5536092	5537293	You want to hear something funny?
5538313	5549579	So as I mentioned weeks prior that those toys are so hard to find right now that they're going for astronomical prices on auction sites like eBay and Amazon.
5550799	5558063	Activision, because most companies eventually they will drop the price of their merchandise automatically.
5558183	5559244	Oh no, no, no, no.
5559384	5561966	They are raising the price of the merchandise.
5562206	5565188	Those toys, remember how they used to cost you like eight bucks or whatever?
5565208	5567710	They're going to cost you one additional dollar to buy that.
5568030	5573234	That'd be like those Call of Duty map packs selling so well that they're going to charge more money for them.
5574174	5574815	But guess what?
5574915	5576816	You stupid fuckers will keep buying them.
5577337	5580439	And so that's why Skylanders Giants is allowed to exist.
5581914	5590139	So don't you fucking bitch and complain about your goddamn map packs costing too much because it's all your fucking fault for buying those stupid Skyliner toys.
5590159	5591180	Why are you so angry?
5591700	5592420	You're so angry.
5593321	5594462	Yeah, I'm not fucking angry.
5594802	5597143	I'll make a quick buck off of those fucking toys.
5600566	5614764	whatever you know I'm gonna be laughing all the way to the bank uh because you people can't get your hands on those toys uh anyways Capcom has announced Ace Attorney 5 that's gonna be coming out uh
5615865	5617386	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
5641296	5646840	and also of course they're going to be doing some HD versions of some of the older Ace Attorney games.
5647060	5653844	1 through 3 are coming to iOS platforms soon and with refreshed sprites and that fun stuff.
5656586	5660370	And last but not least, there's a new game coming out on the PlayStation 3 for the Move.
5661150	5669338	And it's going to allow you to use your PlayStation Move controllers to engage in combat.
5670599	5672300	Looks almost like that...
5674482	5701634	that Kinect game that they have coming out from the guys that do Crysis from Crytek very you know Roman combat type stuff but anyways the game's called Quandra Mortis and it's done by the guys that did the fight the lights out so they know a little bit about battle games they also know about games that don't sell well so it's hard to say whether that game will do well or not but
5703444	5707326	Yeah, and you'll be able to fight against your friends over the PlayStation Network.
5707766	5716790	Also, if you happen to not want to engage in move combat or multi-move controller combat, you can still use a regular controller as well.
5716870	5719751	So it's nice to at least have that option in there.
5721351	5723913	All right, well, moving on to some other rapid-fire news.
5724853	5729715	I think I need a correct musical background for this because it's one of the greatest theme songs ever.
5730955	5731656	Hopefully it'll work.
5731676	5731876	Yeah.
5741563	5747727	Ah, that's right, I played this song because Muppets DLC is coming to LittleBigPlanet 2!
5748348	5750469	That's right, Sackboys will meet the Muppets.
5751210	5752491	This is gonna be so awesome.
5752711	5758475	Like, I have to admit, I'm so embarrassed because I never really got into LittleBigPlanet 2.
5758515	5761917	Like, I never just bought it, because I was like, oh, another $60 game right now, I can't do it.
5762137	5766400	But I love LittleBigPlanet 1, so this might seriously push me over the edge right here.
5766500	5768422	I've got to get LittleBigPlanet 2, because now...
5769102	5770643	There's Muppet DLC in it.
5770984	5779191	It's gonna have 2 new minigames, 5 new levels, a new soundtrack, objects, voices, new trophies, 12 new pins, and a Ralph the Dog costume.
5780032	5780673	Outstanding.
5781033	5786338	It's going to cost $5.99, and it actually just came out this week.
5786438	5789260	Also a new game mechanic is the attractogel.
5789521	5791642	Now Sackboy can walk on walls and ceilings.
5792103	5795025	And any object can do the same, thanks to the attractogel.
5796576	5796956	Amazing.
5796977	5802602	You know, I haven't played through LittleBigPlanet 2 at all other than the first level or so.
5803363	5804304	I should probably go back.
5804544	5804985	Oh, man.
5806126	5810851	It's just one of those games that unfortunately just came out at a really bad time, so I kind of missed it, but it's such a...
5811972	5813332	The first one was so, so good.
5813372	5815693	I can't imagine how the second one is suddenly bad.
5816533	5820814	Anyhow, rumors going around, big rumors that Wii U might change their name.
5821534	5837117	Nintendo is seriously considering renaming the Wii U and it has to do with the fact that I guess a lot of people were confused by the 3DS and the fact that the 3DS and the way they're kind of selling it looks so similar to the DS that people think the 3DS is just a souped up DS.
5837237	5839358	Although I'm kind of like, well, that's what it is, isn't it?
5840578	5840938	But what...
5842119	5842760	But whatever.
5842840	5846083	So Nintendo is very scared about this because maybe it's too similar.
5846523	5851268	So they're thinking that folks will see Wii U and think it's just the same thing, that they already have one at home.
5852930	5861758	I don't know how much I'm on board with this, but I don't really care for the name Wii U. But then again, I didn't really like the name Wii, and it kind of grew on everybody.
5861858	5864381	So those jokes will never get old.
5866001	5889826	I'm noticing this thread on Destructoid which one of the sites that ran the news story had some comments like for people suggesting a new name and a lot of people are suggesting a lot of the development names like Ultra, Dolphin, whatever but I think honestly the best name I saw in here was Nintendo HD what a what a great name for the console just fucking call it what it is it's Nintendo HD I think that's the best suggestion I saw in there
5890649	5893571	Loki, you look like you're wanting to comment on this or something.
5894112	5895193	That sounds fine to me.
5895233	5895913	That makes sense.
5896734	5898955	Wii U, do you love the name Wii U?
5900216	5901017	Do you hope it sticks?
5901097	5908143	Well, I am very fond of the movie Kung Pao and yes, Wii U does tie into Kung Pao quite a lot.
5909844	5914748	I am hoping it sticks just because of all the wonderful Kung Pao clips I get to watch.
5916649	5918451	You should be able to beat him now!
5920575	5936301	also Nintendo has announced that at their recent online thing that they do with investors one of the other things they talked about not just the Nintendo Network but another little little gem slipped in there a new 2D Mario game that will be released in the next fiscal year meaning before March 2013 that will be on the 3DS
5939582	5940143	New Super Mario Bros.
5940163	5940223	Wii
5964144	5964524	Thanks for watching!
5982089	5983310	It's a Mario game.
5983470	5984071	Oh my god.
5984191	5985993	Just make really fun levels and done.
5986033	5990257	You don't need to make something brand new every time.
5990317	6005531	Now, that's not to say that you shouldn't make brand new things because they've had the problem with releasing games that they've changed nothing for ages on, Animal Crossing.
6005951	6006151	Yeah.
6007212	6010133	or, you know, it's just like any of the new play control things.
6010233	6016014	I mean, they should change a little bit, but, you know, it's not to say that the old stuff wasn't good.
6018014	6020315	Some comments in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com.
6020815	6022715	Ranma says, no, just call it Nintendo.
6022935	6024215	The Nintendo, Nintendo.
6024975	6032337	You know, that's been suggested a lot, and that was even rumored, one of the titles at one point, but the NES was the Nintendo, and I think, I don't know, I just...
6033617	6036398	I like Nintendo HD or Wii HD.
6036798	6040279	Just something I like to keep it simple, but that might be too simple.
6040459	6042980	Call it the Nintendo Money Press because it prints money.
6044480	6047081	Some other comments in our chatroom at chat.orange.com.
6047121	6051802	Dongle says, give me true Super Mario World sequel with 2D art in 3D.
6052502	6055163	Amaya says, I want a good Yoshi's Island sequel.
6057251	6058333	Well, yeah, Super Mario Bros.
6058353	6058893	2, Yoshi's Island.
6058913	6062417	That was one of the best.
6063318	6063779	No, thank you.
6065841	6066862	Anyhow, let's move on.
6066962	6067603	DarkSakura.
6069145	6071007	Well, we do have a few other things.
6072168	6075032	It would also be good if I did not have the mailbag pulled up over it.
6076335	6080398	So how about Street Fighter X Tekken?
6080638	6082060	There's some interesting news.
6082780	6088364	And that is a weird picture of Mega Man.
6089565	6090466	It's Mr. Mega Man.
6090786	6091447	Mr. Mega Man?
6091467	6093488	Well, it's technically Mega Man.
6094829	6098532	He's in the pose from the American box art for the first Mega Man.
6100274	6100434	And...
6101877	6102519	That's just weird.
6102659	6105144	Also, the image of it isn't showing, so I can link it in the chat room.
6106487	6107169	But it was...
6110774	6111575	Yeah, bizarre.
6112035	6115538	And also Pac-Man's in it, which I don't get.
6115818	6117199	Well, the Pac-Man thing was cool.
6117219	6118840	Have you seen the trailer with him in action yet?
6119041	6119221	No.
6121042	6122243	Pac-Man was in a while.
6122283	6124305	This is the weird thing.
6124345	6127667	Pac-Man sounds stupid to me, but wait until you see what they did to Pac-Man.
6127767	6129549	You're going to say the same thing I did, I bet.
6129949	6131430	It said with mechanical assistance.
6131550	6133632	Well, it's a very specific mechanical.
6134933	6136414	Let her see, because she's a tech fan.
6136434	6137215	Don't spoil it.
6141352	6143374	I will throw a cartoon Megan Fox at you.
6143614	6144274	Alright, let's see.
6144374	6144815	Ah, here it is.
6146416	6148878	I hope this isn't some stupid-ass parody or something.
6149058	6149619	Let's see here.
6151720	6152141	No!
6152241	6153562	I hate YouTube advertisements.
6153622	6154382	Dammit, dammit, dammit.
6155023	6155623	Alright, hold on.
6156344	6158185	It's some dude proposing to some chick.
6158846	6159746	She's not gonna marry you.
6161948	6162168	What?
6164350	6164810	What are you saying?
6166144	6167405	Oh, we're not going to watch this stupid commercial.
6167525	6168686	We had to get through it.
6168726	6169266	We had to get through it.
6169286	6169626	Here we go.
6169666	6169946	Warning.
6170306	6172608	The following trailer may contain... God damn it.
6172808	6181813	It's some... I hate when people take... I don't think that was... I hate when people take the videos... There we go.
6182314	6183314	It was just on it, Rob.
6184675	6185676	Sorry, I closed it.
6185736	6185976	Hold on.
6186016	6186656	Let me do one more.
6187237	6188597	This is great, great radio.
6188617	6190939	Let's try this one because that's a website I know.
6191139	6193460	So this ought to be something I can trust.
6193960	6194661	I like Machinima.
6196550	6197310	Come on, play the trailer.
6197330	6197650	Here we go.
6198330	6199131	Crude humor.
6199811	6200671	That's like this show.
6201691	6202471	With its trains.
6215294	6216034	I love the cat.
6218175	6219395	So Mega Man looks terrible.
6219415	6220875	The fuck is that?
6226405	6228347	Oh, he's in the Tetsujin outfit.
6229328	6230189	That is cool!
6231030	6232011	Okay, cool's okay.
6234934	6235775	Cool makes sense.
6236556	6238178	Yay, Kuro and Toro!
6247167	6248229	That's awful!
6250225	6252027	They've got to be just trolling us with that.
6252227	6253348	No, that's the real deal.
6253388	6256391	It has, um, what's his name's, Kenji Nafuni's blessing.
6256531	6257352	No, no, no, hold on.
6258553	6265320	It has his blessing from a year ago, prior to the whole Mega Man stuff being cancelled, prior to him leaving the company.
6265854	6268136	Yeah, he's like, hey, you wanted to use that in the game?
6268237	6269378	Okay, yeah, sure, that's fine.
6269398	6271480	I'm going to work on making Mega Man Legends 3.
6271640	6272741	Oh, by the way, we're letting you go.
6275384	6280810	That is the whole... Yeah, blessing from a year ago is what he has.
6280930	6286436	But, I mean, now it's just like fans are pissed off that you won't make a Mega Man game, that you won't put Mega Man in Mega Man...
6287016	6290719	Ultimate, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and then you pull this fucking shit.
6290920	6295503	You might as well just dress up Frank West as Mega Man because that would be less offensive than this bullshit.
6295603	6301848	It's funny watching what's happening because a lot of people... It's really interesting because a lot of gamers are looking at this going, not funny.
6302809	6303650	This is not funny.
6304390	6308254	I feel like gamers are actually offended by that.
6308314	6310515	DarkSakura, you just saw it for the first time.
6310575	6311736	Are you having that reaction too?
6311796	6312337	It's not funny?
6313757	6315118	I feel like I've got to throw up.
6315278	6318219	I mean, I'm not, I have a headache now.
6318559	6322822	I started to have a headache earlier and it was going away as I started to feel better.
6323262	6325463	But now I feel nauseous and my headache has come back.
6325763	6328344	Think about Pac-Man as Mokujin because that is kind of awesome actually.
6328364	6329025	That's Tetsujin.
6329245	6329325	Oh.
6329945	6331486	It was the metal outfit.
6331506	6332046	Oh, okay.
6332286	6333147	Tetsujin means iron.
6333908	6336372	Moku would Mokuyobi is Wednesday
6346661	6347341	No one curry.
6349402	6357746	I mean, I was just going to say that doesn't Capcom understand that these fucking characters are not part of Street Fighter or Tekken?
6357786	6365809	I mean, I understand that they want to do like a SNK versus, you know, versus Capcom game or something like that.
6366289	6392880	but there was a Namco cross Capcom game but it wasn't a fighting game why didn't they just do you know instead of Street Fighter cross Tekken why didn't they just do Namco cross Capcom the fighting game because that's what this is like they have the fucking final fight characters they have Cole which I mean that cool you got your exclusive characters for the PlayStation Cole isn't either one but okay whatever you know and and like Pac-Man so it just doesn't make any sense and none for Xbox buy
6395718	6397438	The only cool thing about this is Pac-Man.
6398939	6399679	Pac-Man's adorable.
6399699	6402480	But see, right before you watch that trailer, you're like, what the fuck?
6402520	6403100	Pac-Man?
6403140	6404240	Like, that's not gonna make sense.
6404260	6405480	But you watch it, you're like, oh, okay, that's right.
6405700	6406200	Mega Man!
6406220	6407281	What'd they do to Mega Man?
6408221	6410742	That's like the exact same reaction the rest of the internet had.
6411242	6416583	He's like, not even, you know, kinda lean and mean looking, but he's...
6418487	6420329	Looks like he's been eating too many donuts.
6420429	6422470	He looks like Mega Man going through a midlife crisis.
6422510	6424532	It looks like I put on a Mega Man outfit.
6424872	6425093	No.
6425673	6427354	Rob, you would look better than that dude.
6427374	6427855	Well, thank you.
6429784	6430344	Next story.
6430704	6430925	Yes.
6431585	6432965	How about some Doctor Who news?
6434166	6447610	There will be two Doctor Who games that are going to be on the PC, PlayStation 3, and... Actually, there's... There were two.
6448090	6451991	There is a Doctor Who The Eternity Clock is going to come out on March 2012.
6452931	6458133	And it is going to be... Well, it has The Silence.
6459568	6465352	and apparently a bunch of the other bad guys too like the Daleks because you can't have a Doctor Who game without the Daleks being all over it.
6465412	6466192	Exterminate.
6467473	6467973	Next news.
6469254	6470595	We're not having a BlizzCon next year.
6472116	6472656	No BlizzCon.
6473416	6473977	As in this year?
6474637	6475238	This year, yeah.
6475598	6478980	That means that I won't be able to do DisCon like I did last year.
6480541	6488005	Yep, no BlizzCon because apparently they are so busy with Diablo 3 and the pandas
6489526	6492709	and the Titan MMO.
6492829	6494270	They're just not going to do it.
6494751	6496052	Or they just have nothing to show us.
6496632	6497373	I mean, let's be real.
6497413	6498314	They have nothing to show us.
6498674	6499375	We already know everything.
6499715	6501036	Titan's not ready to show.
6501697	6505020	And whatever the next next expansion is for WoW, they're not going to show this early.
6505040	6506101	Little pandas.
6506601	6508923	But they didn't have a BlizzCon in 2006.
6509263	6512306	So folks do need to realize it was never supposed to be an annual event.
6512326	6513327	It just kind of worked out that way.
6514008	6516211	LOL Pandas.
6516512	6519436	You realize I have saved the name Fatty Cakes to make my panda.
6519736	6519936	I know.
6520497	6521819	What did I call my mud slapper?
6524108	6532054	After it was, you don't, we were playing around to You Don't Know Jack, and I think it was, is it one of Baskin-Robbins 31 flavors, or is it a term for a fart?
6533636	6536498	And Mud Slapper came up, and I'm like, I'm going to name my pandar in that.
6537098	6537859	Yes, that's a fart.
6538019	6545925	I almost did, named her after my, would name my panda after my current druid, and made her Ponderina.
6546746	6546966	Nice.
6548047	6548287	All right.
6549246	6550848	That's it for Rapid Fire News.
6551148	6553251	I think we've been promising this for some time now.
6553291	6556054	I think it's time to get into tonight's list list.
6559639	6559860	Yay!
6560440	6568345	Tonight's listless topic is What bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U, Xbox Lube, or PlayStation 4?
6569306	6586138	This was inspired by a tweet that was sent to me earlier this week from SSJ100Matt that said The next listless or match game should feature gaming bullshit rumors Because I was tweeting about the whole ridiculousness of some of the Xbox rumors that were going around And he suggested that and I said, you know what, consider it done
6586678	6587178	So here it is.
6587338	6592041	What bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U, Xbox Loop, or PlayStation 4?
6592881	6600405	If you have suggestions, you should yell them out in our chatroom at chat.orangemonstrady.com because when a host needs an answer, they might consult our chatroom and pick some of our favorites.
6601405	6603586	The way this works, I'll recap for you one time.
6603706	6607408	Four people are going to participate, so it's going to be us and Alan is in the room.
6607648	6608569	Hi Alan, how you doing?
6609169	6610329	Good, yay, hi.
6611090	6611650	What's new?
6612631	6613091	Skyrim.
6613891	6614672	Okay, alright.
6615232	6621715	So we're all going to go around and name our top three, and then we each go around the room and take one off of the list.
6622175	6623656	That leaves a list of eight.
6624016	6636843	You guys in our chat room then vote on the list of eight to pick your number one and number two favorites, and then we have our definitive list of the top three bullshit rumors that will be next about the Wii U, Xbox Loom, or PlayStation 4.
6637683	6638965	My hand was in the air like I was in school
6652358	6663024	A headset will come out that will send a signal directly to the brain through a small laser shot toward the optical nerve that will provide an immersive environment and a euphoric effect, making them easily conquerable by our alien overlords.
6664045	6666386	So, I'm going to shorten that to say Borg headset.
6666726	6669368	The little thing from the Star Trek episode, The Game.
6670408	6670528	Ah.
6675171	6676492	And what console will that be on?
6677870	6678651	It's Nintendo.
6679832	6683695	It'll be on the Wii U. That's a Sony thing.
6684376	6685797	Controlling you, that would be Sony.
6686197	6688459	It's always one step closer to the holodeck, right?
6688639	6690241	Yes, one step closer to the holodeck.
6690281	6691021	How about Loki?
6691041	6691642	Why don't you go next?
6691682	6692803	Loki, what's your number three answer?
6693291	6704236	My number three answer will be that the Xbox loop to further its immersion with gamers and stuff will fire different colored liquids at you depending on the situation.
6704617	6709459	Blood spray, sweat, paint.
6712160	6735673	so it will actually it's gonna be liquid vision and it'll actually fire shit at you and get your living room and when you're playing a sex game it's iridescent and foamy and shows up really well under a black light all right I'll go next my number three answer for next bullshit rumor is
6736093	6742476	The Xbox Lube will introduce a new technology that is 100% hackproof!
6744317	6745238	Yay!
6745578	6746238	See what I did there?
6746538	6747599	I see what you did there.
6747659	6750300	Alright, so the Xbox Lube will be 100% hackproof.
6753258	6754680	Outro Music
6776701	6778944	It's made out of a mystery material from space.
6779785	6780106	All right.
6780646	6783570	So, Alan, what is your number three answer?
6785493	6788116	Microsoft purchases the Mega Video brand.
6788136	6791300	Next, Xbox caps streaming Netflix at 72 minutes.
6791340	6793683	Adds DLC queue for XBLA silver numbers.
6795629	6797029	How am I supposed to shorten that?
6797049	6799050	Wait, they're going to cap Netflix to 72 minutes?
6817696	6819097	In some ways, that's funny.
6819177	6824338	That's trolling the pirates because it's like, LOL, you got a free movie and then trolled.
6824498	6825919	You don't get to see the ending.
6825959	6826579	That's kind of funny.
6826599	6827679	And what was the other half of that?
6828880	6836002	Also, for Mega Download, you have to enter a queue to actually download the episode you want, and sometimes it would be up to an hour or more.
6836462	6839583	So if you're an Xbox Silver member, you'd have to wait to buy to get your DLC.
6840864	6841624	All right, there you go.
6841744	6843885	Xbox taking some tips from Mega Video.
6844565	6847508	All right, let's go to Loki for his number two answer.
6847528	6848749	I'm sorry, DarkSakura was first.
6848829	6850310	I was going to say, please.
6850350	6851231	I was doing things out of order.
6851271	6852873	DarkSakura, your number two answer, please.
6853073	6859518	The Wii U will actually have a camera and a controller that maps your face to your Mii, but it secretly steals your soul and feeds it to Miyamoto.
6860459	6867586	So they advertise it as having a webcam in it, but it steals your soul.
6867746	6869668	Now, what will Miyamoto be doing with those souls?
6870393	6872114	Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
6872915	6873355	Okay.
6873695	6875897	Using it to fuel his dark magical powers.
6878178	6879159	To make a new Zelda game.
6879499	6880200	All right.
6880720	6882561	Loki, your number two answer.
6882621	6883882	It'll be Zelda Soul Force.
6885744	6890047	Well, I was going to have it be like the Wii U as a VR headset, but that's kind of been done before.
6890167	6891828	So the Wii U is the controller.
6891948	6894450	Like the actual console is the controller.
6894810	6897632	So you better make sure you don't throw it because that might be bad.
6900598	6901399	It's a giant glove.
6903300	6905662	Wait, I put Wii U. The console is the controller.
6905722	6906523	Don't throw it.
6906663	6906984	Change it.
6907004	6908205	Here we go.
6908265	6909025	It's got to be funnier.
6909245	6910006	Alright, fine.
6910887	6915231	It is the controller, but it's shaped like a giant number one foam glove.
6919254	6923538	Because they're the number one consoles.
6923698	6927161	I like the idea of a big number one foam glove being the next
6930849	6935592	They're trying to reel in the sports lover demographic.
6936652	6946998	My number two answer is that the PlayStation 4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid so you can participate in Tron, like IRL.
6948638	6949139	End of line.
6950099	6951200	This show reboot, right?
6951220	6952100	Is that what you're talking about?
6952160	6952420	Yeah.
6952440	6953481	I don't remember that show.
6953541	6954001	What was that?
6954241	6955162	Incoming Game.
6955322	6957763	It was a Saturday morning cartoon on ABC.
6957843	6960765	It was one of the first fully featured... Remember they had blue faces?
6960845	6961345	They were purple.
6961605	6968128	They were purple.
6968509	6969569	Hold on, I'm typing this out.
6969629	6971930	PS4 will actually let you beam yourself in the grid.
6972371	6973031	Okay.
6973831	6976253	I have a friend that's a really big fan of that show, too.
6978615	6980357	How many years has that been off the show?
6980417	6981417	All right.
6982699	6985641	Alan, your number two answer for next bullshit rumor.
6986762	6995710	Taking a hint from the PS2 Emotion Engine, the PS4 will have an empathy engine chip that actually really does feel the same pain as you when its $799 price point is revealed.
7001791	7002572	Womp womp.
7002752	7003032	Alright.
7003953	7008877	So the PS4 Empathy Engine actually will feel sorry for Sony when the price point is revealed.
7009517	7010117	Alright, I like that.
7010137	7011298	PS4 Empathy Engine.
7011939	7013080	Alright, DarkSakura.
7013340	7015261	It's time for the number one answers.
7015281	7017343	Let me recap, just so we don't have any duplicates.
7017363	7017963	Let me recap.
7018363	7020165	Headset from the game for PS4.
7020185	7021466	I should put Star Trek the game.
7024380	7026682	Okay, headset from Star Trek The Game for PlayStation 4.
7027522	7029383	Fire different colored liquids at you.
7029423	7030384	What console was that?
7031385	7032045	Lube.
7032165	7032605	Oh, the Lube.
7033706	7034527	Come on.
7034667	7035948	It's lubricating.
7036568	7036928	Liquid.
7037569	7039190	It fires warming gel in your eye.
7041031	7042952	Xbox Lube is 100% hack proof.
7043513	7046635	Xbox teams up with Mega Video, which brings caps for Netflix.
7047215	7049617	The Wii U will steal your soul and feed to Miyamoto.
7050157	7054000	Wii U is the console, is the controller, and it comes with a big number one foam glove.
7055140	7057821	PS4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid.
7058381	7060962	And the PlayStation 4 has an empathy engine.
7060982	7063503	When you hear the $799 price point, it will cry.
7064243	7065424	Alright, DarkSakura.
7065584	7066724	I would think it would laugh.
7067665	7071566	Number one answer for next bullshit rumor.
7071586	7072326	For the lube.
7073147	7077708	Everyone will be issued a skin implant that has what games they've purchased registered to their DNA.
7083713	7086966	That would be the only real way And most importantly, hack-proof
7088365	7092627	So when you actually go in to give blood samples, they'll be able to see what games you've purchased.
7092947	7095528	Ooh, someone's been playing X-Tango.
7096228	7096728	Okay.
7097749	7098029	Really?
7098089	7099249	You bought Fusion Frenzy?
7099529	7100010	All right.
7100530	7102711	Loki, number one answer.
7103251	7107393	The PlayStation 4 will be co-produced by Capcom.
7107493	7114836	It will arrive in the shape of the Bad Box art Mega Man in the position where he is teabagging the consumer.
7116476	7121260	As a special thanks from Capcom Wait, the console or the box?
7121520	7144918	No, the actual console will be in the shape of Bad Box Art Mega Man Think of it as a statue, if you will Where he is teabagging the user PS4 co-produced by Capcom Console is shaped as Mega Man teabag It's the ultimate insult Or the ultimate troll I see, I see It's all been leading up to this Exactly It's a PlayStation exclusive, you see
7146132	7153125	My number one answer, President Cat is a launch title for the Wii U. That's a seller.
7156753	7157934	I might sell me the system.
7158014	7159355	Hey, it could happen.
7159836	7160136	All right.
7160476	7163038	Hey, an insider source told me they're thinking about it.
7164639	7166741	Alan, your number one answer.
7167301	7171244	My ideas kind of fell apart when I came to number three, so this one is really as good.
7173006	7178970	The second gen 3DS XL will also double as and work better than the Wii U's controller tablet from launch.
7179191	7181392	Comes with a free seppuku blade for early adopters.
7185600	7195224	So basically the next 3DS will work with the Wii U and actually be better than what comes with the Wii U. And you can fall on it when you realize how much you paid for it.
7195424	7196485	Yeah.
7196505	7196825	Got it.
7196925	7197225	All right.
7198085	7198926	All right, guys.
7198986	7199566	Here we go.
7199686	7199986	Let's see.
7200026	7202227	First, I got to read off some of the answers from chat here.
7202287	7203067	I don't know if I see.
7203447	7209390	TigerClaw says, how about the Wii U introduces a new career field that lets you control the dashboard or games but only using your mind?
7211271	7220699	Ahamkara says, Sony and Microsoft secretly joined forces to develop a console to beat Nintendo, since that's the only way that they could win the console battle in Japan and the worldwide.
7221780	7227705	Acidic Vampire thinks that in DarkSakura's answer about Miyamoto taking the souls, they'll be transferred to the Miis.
7228545	7230006	Let's see.
7231426	7234027	TigerClaw says, the Xbox introduces a peripheral.
7234107	7234287	Oh, wait.
7234307	7236428	I already saw that one.
7236768	7238849	Somebody said something about they only play MMOs.
7239889	7240269	There you go.
7240289	7242030	Some of the answers from our chat room.
7242430	7242670	All right.
7242710	7244851	But we want to change yours.
7246051	7246932	Yeah, get rid of my third one.
7246952	7247272	Or my final one.
7247292	7248072	I want to replace it.
7248092	7248392	The 3DS XL?
7248412	7248552	Yes.
7248652	7249412	It's all that I need.
7254286	7272352	So it's rumored that the load up splash screen for the Wii U is actually a memory erasing pulse so that they can get you to buy Legend of Zelda and Mario yet another time.
7273893	7278735	So I have the Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you re-buy games all over again.
7278755	7279295	I like that.
7280530	7282392	Do I own Super Mario 3?
7282692	7283293	I can't remember.
7283313	7284274	Don't I have Mario 3?
7285075	7285916	I love Mario 3!
7287558	7290662	Alright, now's the part where we go around and eliminate items from the list.
7290702	7292304	It's very difficult, but it has to be done.
7292805	7295428	Alright, here's the list as it stands so far.
7295828	7298031	Headset from Star Trek The Game for PS4.
7299232	7301594	Xbox Lube, fire different colored liquids at you.
7302095	7303736	Xbox Lube is 100% hack-proof.
7303976	7306518	Xbox teams up with Mega Video, caps for Netflix.
7306999	7309280	Wii U will steal your soul and feed them to Miyamoto.
7309761	7313404	Wii U is the console's controller and it's just a big number one foam glove.
7313864	7316606	The PlayStation 4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid.
7317106	7319628	PlayStation 4 has an empathy engine, priced at $799, so it will feel pained.
7321910	7326034	Xbox Lube, Skin Implant, which purchase is registered to your DNA.
7326915	7331138	The PlayStation 4 is co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as Mega Man teabagging you.
7331979	7338965	President Cat is a launch title for the Wii U and the Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you rebuy the games again.
7339826	7342188	Unfortunately, the list cannot stay in this shape.
7342588	7345751	We have to tinker with it a little bit and erase those that are unworthy.
7346131	7348273	DarkSakura, which of these is unworthy of the list?
7349335	7352217	I have to go with the liquid one.
7352237	7354119	That's just ew.
7354199	7355340	That's one of my favorites.
7355460	7359023	The Xbox Lube firing different colored liquids at you.
7359083	7361785	I would vote for that one, but it is off the list.
7361925	7362626	Sorry, chatters.
7363066	7365708	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7365848	7372914	I take off it's 100% hack-proof because they will make that claim and unfortunately it's not going to be 100% hack-proof.
7373435	7375136	Alright, it is stricken from the list.
7375897	7375997	Um...
7382236	7384438	I'm thinking, sorry, I don't mean to be quiet.
7386499	7396326	I'm going to erase... I'm going to erase... I'm sorry, Jamie, the headset from Star Trek The Game for the PlayStation 4.
7397147	7397967	It went over my head.
7399669	7402030	Alright, it is off the list.
7402511	7404312	Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7406133	7407154	Oh boy, um...
7417204	7423628	President Cat's launch title for the Wii U. I think you just eliminated the one the entire chat would have voted for.
7425489	7426630	But it is off the list.
7426810	7427050	What?
7427631	7429912	That's probably the second or third time I've done that on this list.
7429952	7432194	We've gotten rid of the popular fandom one.
7432314	7435016	So I'm just keeping up with my shitty reputation.
7436554	7444657	All right, Alan keeps his shitty reputation by striking President Cat as a launch title for the Wii U. It is off the list.
7445037	7445718	So here it is.
7445818	7446458	Here is the list.
7446558	7452700	As you can vote for, please send your number one and your number two answers as a private message to Sky in the chat room.
7452920	7454921	S-K-I-E, Sky in the chat room.
7455341	7456782	Here is the list as it stands now.
7457302	7459883	Xbox teams up with Mega Video, and there's caps for Netflix.
7460283	7462644	The Wii U will steal your soul and feed it to Miyamoto.
7463124	7483841	The Wii U where the console is the controller and it's a big number one foam glove The PS4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid from Tron PlayStation 4 empathy engine that will feel the pain of a $799 price point Xbox Lube has a skin implant with purchases registered to your DNA PlayStation 4 is co-produced by Capcom and the old school Mega Man will teabag you
7485022	7506829	Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you rebuy games there is the list as it stands now place your number one and your number two votes in a private message to Sky S-K-I-E in the chat with your vote we will tally them up and have the answers for you shortly in the meantime let's go to more news from Loki thank you Alan are you going to stick around for results later?
7507509	7512991	yeah just to tell chat the reason why I deleted the President Cat one is because it was more about a game than the console
7514642	7517223	Justify, justify, justify.
7519523	7520324	Alright, no, it's fine.
7520664	7521944	Alright, moving on.
7523465	7528366	There's a rumor that SNK may be releasing a new Neo Geo handheld system.
7529446	7535188	Not necessarily a Neo Geo Pocket, but it's currently known as the Neo Geo Portable Device.
7536288	7538451	Um... And it's a handheld.
7538831	7540673	They're saying it's slightly bigger than an iPhone.
7540693	7548060	It comes with 2 gigs of storage, plenty of buttons, a 4.3 inch screen, SD card slot, headphone jack, and AV out.
7548620	7551263	Sounds just like a Dingu, to be honest.
7551563	7552484	Looks just like a Dingu.
7552504	7556829	Um... And, uh... They're saying, um...
7557409	7573058	Thanks to official SNK licensing, it comes preloaded with 20 Neo Geo titles, North American versions, including Metal Slug, Fatal Fury Specials, Sengoku, King of the Monsters, and Magician Lord, as well as many others.
7573879	7575420	I have Magician Lord already.
7576000	7579042	And, let's see...
7580615	7582237	Yeah, it sounds neat.
7582537	7593289	Of course, this is coming from Famicom Plaza, and SNK hasn't really confirmed anything yet, but it looks neat.
7594951	7595492	Totally want...
7598539	7623133	interesting as long as the games are cheaper that's the most important thing oh yeah all right moving on with some other uh little Nintendo updates going on uh Nintendo has apparently um I guess they're they're really experiencing some heavy losses and it's even funny because the story's so much out there that that one what is that Asian company that does all the animations that end up on like Conan O'Brien and stuff of the news NME is that their name
7623493	7623914	I can't remember.
7623934	7625976	It's like anime or something.
7626076	7629359	They actually did a video on this whole Nintendo's losing money thing.
7629679	7635645	But the interesting kind of silver lining to this is that apparently 15 million 3DS units have been sold since the launch.
7635685	7641051	So 3DS has really recovered in many ways, which I seem to remember saying on this show would happen around Christmas.
7641071	7641431	But anyway...
7643633	7651179	Here's the thing though, Nintendo did basically switch their forecast around from a $20 billion profit to an actual loss.
7652040	7662749	Nintendo had sales of $7.2 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal year, and that was a 31% decrease, and their overall loss was 48.4 billion yen, that's $620 million dollars.
7665752	7675600	Quote, Nintendo 3DS hardware during the nine months ended December 31st, 2011 were 11.43 million units and the total worldwide sales since its launch exceeded 15 million units.
7675640	7677681	That's in the official press release from the company.
7678342	7681584	Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 are million selling titles.
7681624	7684347	I want to say I've heard they're up to like 5 million actually at this point.
7684987	7713661	so apparently some of these financial woes are making people think maybe they should get into more mobile gaming there's that whole talk again maybe Nintendo should put something out on iOS but I highly doubt that will ever happen their stock by the way is currently at a five year low so they have a lot riding on them for this E3 in my opinion they're gonna have to impress if they don't impress at this year's E3 it's gonna be very bad very bad
7715270	7720436	Alright, moving on, DarkSakura is going to open up the email bag and read some emails for us.
7724461	7732191	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com DarkSakura dives into the email bag and reads some of those emails here on air.
7733959	7734520	Blade 3 Studio Grade
7752677	7753438	Ooh!
7754239	7758864	I don't have any spare XLR cables, unfortunately, but I believe you are likely already using them.
7759245	7762148	So if you guys could contact me back, whatever, we can work it out.
7762208	7762648	Thanks, guys.
7762668	7763710	Keep up the fantastic work.
7764030	7764310	P.S.
7764350	7765111	My grammar sucks.
7765211	7765532	Lol.
7765612	7766353	Raffle party.
7766393	7766913	Limifo.
7767734	7768635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7789545	7797929	Well, we first had an email from Rabababa that said, I looked around for sites blacking out today, January 18th.
7798389	7799189	I'm very disappointed.
7799429	7802791	Sites that could bring a lot more force to the event are not participating.
7803191	7806312	Google censored their own logo, but I think being blacked out would be more effective.
7806693	7810274	The only one of my favorite sites that is down is GamePolitics.
7810334	7813696	Your site was also down when I checked, but something tells me that wasn't on purpose.
7813736	7814436	I guess it was.
7815899	7817140	Yeah, we took it down on purpose.
7817180	7818160	There should have been a message there.
7818300	7819001	Now there's a PS.
7819481	7819701	Okay.
7820761	7821021	Sorry.
7821642	7825844	Almost immediately after writing the email below, senators and reps are dropping their support from SOPA and PIPA.
7826524	7836729	Even the sponsors of the bills, the MPAA, then responded in the most ironic way, accusing sites like Reddit and Wikipedia of trying to make Congress into their corporate puppets to further their financial empire.
7838496	7839837	That is ironic and stupid.
7840478	7846965	Also, the Google protest seems to have caught some attention for linking their censorship logo directly to a petition with a very cool infographic.
7847565	7852891	My own opinion is that piracy is already wrong and we have the legal system in place to address that via due process.
7853427	7855367	Well, look what happened to that mega video.
7855628	7863309	Although, you know, it did take a while, but that guy's, you know, and a lot of his people are in jail now and not getting out anytime soon.
7863609	7869411	By the way, did you know that that same guy was, like, the number one Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 player, like, in the world?
7869451	7869731	He cheated.
7870471	7870851	Did he?
7871031	7871211	Yeah.
7871311	7871871	How'd he do it?
7872672	7873752	Uh, there's ways.
7875672	7876452	You don't want to share?
7876512	7876853	Okay.
7876953	7878993	No, I just, I don't play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
7879893	7881494	I'm assuming it's very much like, uh...
7885426	7906441	it is ironic though that he's getting more time in jail than some rapists and killers but you know welcome to America apparently he used to play like Quake and stuff like that and Rage Quit and stuff and I don't know whatever I don't know I can't can't really speak for you know playing him so I don't know
7906957	7908137	We have one last email.
7908898	7919261	Oh, and by the way, people who sent me the Master System things, I've got two of you already, and I'm going to be sending those out.
7919461	7920521	Just to let you know, I haven't forgotten.
7921642	7922362	I just have to get paid.
7923362	7927544	Hey, OLR crew, happy new year and congratulations on the move to the new studio.
7928004	7934766	The show sounds great, and it's good to hear Alan is a regular contributor now, although I have to express my endless... What?
7935071	7936952	Oops, sorry, the Twitter music started playing.
7937032	7939533	My endless sorrow at the retirement of Shermie.
7939853	7941314	Shermie is not sorrowful.
7941374	7944776	She has her own room that smells like her butt.
7945356	7948057	Except I cleaned, it's also the laundry room.
7948137	7949318	I cleaned it, but you know what?
7949338	7949898	She's happy.
7950238	7952980	That room gets warm every time we dry the clothes.
7954000	7957882	Sometimes a warm towel gets dropped on her as a blanket.
7958462	7959523	And she's a very happy girl.
7960143	7960503	DarkSakura.com
7984421	7985462	So, but here's the thing.
7985742	7991165	If you're my 3DS friend, I send out pictures of the cats in 3D all the time on Swap Note.
7991445	7997149	So, just ask Tiger Claw or Jason if he's listening tonight or Shane, I think, is in chat.
7997189	8000270	A few of you are on my Facebook and I put pictures up on Facebook.
8000351	8000551	Yeah.
8001191	8004553	Especially Mariko walking around with that tail in the air.
8005413	8005954	Look at me.
8006194	8007014	My tail's in the air.
8007094	8007955	Look at my butt.
8009556	8010216	I love Mariko.
8010677	8011277	Such a sweetie.
8011880	8014521	Sanrio is very, very, she's a cute little old lady too.
8014541	8016321	She's sweet, but she gives me the stink eye sometimes.
8016581	8017662	Yeah, because you're another girl.
8018282	8018582	I know.
8019422	8024844	So I have two disparate topics I was hoping that Rob, Jamie, and Loki could weigh in on.
8025144	8025324	No.
8026684	8028425	The first being the announcement of Resident Evil 6.
8029045	8030686	Are any of you excited by this news?
8030906	8031486	Not really.
8033142	8036104	I don't play the Resident Evil series, so no.
8036285	8044190	I got out of the series some time ago, although I did dabble in Resident Evil 4, which was pretty darn good, and I really should have committed more time to the game.
8044670	8048193	And then Resident Evil 5 was like, what?
8048713	8054897	From what I hear, Resident Evil 6 is a little more like 4 than it was like 5, which is probably a very good thing.
8057499	8061862	What I want to know is, why does the logo look like a chick blowing a giraffe?
8064140	8065140	Have you looked at the logo?
8065180	8066922	Wait, let me put it here in chat here.
8067502	8070405	Well, while you do that, I'm going to finish reading the part of the email.
8071626	8072967	Are you excited by the news?
8073087	8082255	I am personally having a bit of a fangasm seeing them bring back Leon, Ashley, and Hunnigan as I am a huge Resident Evil 4 fan but have been playing all the games since day one.
8083797	8086059	It does kind of look like giraffe.
8086339	8086619	See?
8086639	8088220	It's just blowing!
8088480	8090122	It's a chick blowing a giraffe.
8090322	8091443	Cannot unsee.
8091603	8093204	Yes, now you won't be able to unsee it.
8093244	8093704	There it is.
8097787	8099929	Oh, Jeffrey, what have you gotten yourself into?
8099949	8101910	That's what happened to the Toys R Us mascot.
8101930	8103191	I haven't seen him in forever.
8103291	8105773	I'm glad he found work on Resident Evil porn.
8106994	8109797	Speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.
8109837	8115963	And by the way, the last one that I actually played was, that I really actually last played was Gun Survivor.
8116944	8119526	The one that was like Code Veronica, Gun Survivor 2.
8119586	8120427	Oh, okay.
8120507	8121008	In the arcade.
8121688	8123550	That was the last one I actually played myself.
8124231	8126813	So speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.
8126933	8129496	Have any of you downloaded the Revelations demo for 3DS?
8129816	8130497	No, because I don't have one.
8131197	8142460	I was particularly impressed by the graphical potential the 3DS is beginning to show.
8142840	8152122	With the Vita coming out next month and games for dedicated portable systems trending toward console-level graphics, do any of you feel that at some point the two will intersect?
8153863	8154203	Maybe.
8154223	8154323	Maybe.
8154966	8155426	I'm not sure.
8155506	8156607	Wait, read that last sentence again.
8157607	8168372	With the Vita coming out next month and games for dedicated portable systems trending toward console level graphics, do any of you feel that at some point the two will intersect?
8168683	8172585	Well, haven't handhelds always kind of felt like they're just a generation behind?
8172965	8173845	I mean, look at the DS.
8173925	8176066	The DS is a lot like a Nintendo 64.
8176706	8179207	Like, the first DS was a bunch of ports and Nintendo 64 stuff.
8179507	8181908	The Game Boy Advance was a bunch of ports and Super Nintendo stuff.
8181928	8185370	The original Game Boy, especially the color, had a lot of NES stuff on it.
8185430	8189651	So they're always kind of, you know, just a generation behind.
8189731	8190772	So I think...
8191892	8193233	I don't know about the Vita so much.
8193253	8200996	I wouldn't say that the Vita is going to have the potential to play like PlayStation 3 stuff, although... It's supposed to be PlayStation 3 quality graphics.
8201076	8202897	Yeah, because it's smaller resolution.
8202937	8210941	So yeah, that's kind of what I'm talking out here is that because of the smaller resolution, you know, your TV, when you say 1080p, that's 1080 pixels, right?
8211261	8213302	But the amount that's on the Vita is less.
8213602	8219325	So you can still render high definition images, but just a lower resolution because it's a smaller picture.
8219565	8221025	So I think it's going to look really good.
8223366	8225387	But I especially don't know about direct ports.
8225607	8234249	I'm more excited about this whole thing we were talking about earlier with the whole Vita possibly connecting to your PS3, be it hacks or whatever.
8234829	8237470	All I'm waiting for is Grand Theft Auto V on the Vita.
8237810	8238090	Sold.
8238750	8258017	there's a little bit more I wonder if at some point one market might cannibalize the other while I'm personally thrilled by the prospect of having PS3 slash 360 quality games on the go it seems only logical to assume that at some point these systems will function as portable consoles right oh so that was really the point he was getting out of that okay I get it now
8258357	8267122	Why not just wirelessly stream the content from the portable system to the TV in your living room if you want a console-style experience and slip it into your pocket when you don't?
8267543	8276068	I understand that the Wii U is trying to walk the fine line between these two entities, but it honestly seems like a letdown if the remote only works when you are in Wi-Fi range.
8276228	8276688	Your thoughts?
8278109	8279190	Okay, I get it.
8279330	8281771	So, okay, the rest of the email really kind of fills that in.
8281871	8282552	So the iPad 2?
8284744	8285165	What about it?
8286086	8287027	It does just that.
8287647	8291651	You can stream content from the iPad to your Apple TV to your TV.
8292032	8300421	I get what he's saying though is that if the power of what is taking up all the space in my living room is in my pocket, then why do I need a console?
8301622	8306025	But keep in mind, that's why console developers are kind of... I think console developers kind of see this too.
8306065	8308827	And I think that's why you're starting to see things that won't fit in your pocket.
8308927	8311269	Like Kinect.
8312009	8316813	All these streaming devices that will go to your home theater sound system and so forth.
8317173	8319535	And these systems becoming more of like entertainment hubs.
8320015	8320536	But I don't know.
8320556	8320716	For me...
8323057	8345153	I don't like playing handheld games all the time sometimes I want that gigantic you know 34 inch or however big our TV is picture you know like I would want to play a game like Final Fantasy 13 too on my little DS in bed you know I want to you know maybe sometimes it would be cool like once in a while for the mundane stuff but the big cut scenes and things like that I want to see on the high def TV you know I don't know I
8347409	8374411	I don't know if one's necessarily going to cannibalize the other but it's a very interesting point that you're making and it's kind of neat that now the consoles are kind of doing things that the TVs are having a hard time like 3D, the TVs haven't all been able to adopt that across the board yet now here we have the 3DS so it's interesting a lot of ports, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of ports like the same stuff coming out on the PS3 you're going to see on the Vita and the 3DS it'll be interesting
8374744	8374924	Yes.
8375984	8383466	To conclude, your loyal OLR fanboy, TonicVision, who I would love to commend on fantastic grammar and spelling.
8384227	8385907	Gold star emailer of the week.
8386247	8388668	Yep, you win the no prize.
8389968	8393909	Kaijudo in our chatroom says, my thoughts is this person plays way too many video games.
8394249	8395990	Why would you want to walk around with a PlayStation 3?
8396823	8398883	Well, I seem to remember... Hey, I have a Nomad.
8399464	8405685	Well, that, and didn't they used to have that little, like, tiny screen that you could plug into the back of a PlayStation 1?
8406345	8406605	Yes.
8406825	8408566	Like, it was an actual thing.
8408806	8409346	Play it in the car.
8409526	8411286	Yeah, so you could, like, play it in the car.
8411986	8415147	And didn't somebody in this room make one for an Xbox?
8416227	8418768	Yeah, that Xbox blew up, by the way.
8419500	8419940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8439733	8440554	Hooked up, pop!
8441834	8444536	And... blew something, so... Eh, whatever.
8444796	8445056	It was old.
8445716	8457123	For the record, I have a Nomad, and I have a Turbo Express, which with a TV tuner, you could hook up your Turbo Express to the, uh... to the TV, and then you could just take the Turbo Express with you.
8457743	8458704	And with your cue cards.
8459955	8462157	I really like this comment from Bochikawa in chat.
8462177	8464759	And I think this really gives you something to think about on the topics.
8465159	8467962	Let me read it again from Bochikawa at chat.
8468642	8470144	Handheld games are different to me.
8470704	8474507	If I were to pull out Street Fighter on break at work, I wouldn't stop.
8475148	8477510	But playing Pokemon at work is quick and easy.
8478905	8483447	That's a very interesting point is think about the types of games that are being made on these systems.
8483627	8484988	What is easier to play on the go?
8485308	8486489	And I think I was mentioning this before.
8486529	8487529	It might have been on Bobby's show.
8487549	8490531	We were doing the call at the end of the Bobby Blackwolf show as we do every week.
8491431	8497354	But I was talking about how Tiny Tower makes a great iOS game because you can play it for 30 seconds or whatever and then you're done.
8497894	8502798	Like, it would be a terrible game to play on PlayStation 3 or something like that.
8503118	8504680	Like, it just kind of works on iOS.
8505040	8514588	And a lot of the stuff that they kind of try to force on iOS, like ports of games like Mega Man 2 or the Capcom Arcade where you can play Street Fighter 2 on the iPhone, it sucks.
8515108	8516089	You can't control it.
8516129	8517490	The touchscreen thing doesn't work.
8517750	8518351	It's terrible.
8519171	8525296	So sometimes it is designing about really the right game to go with the system.
8526637	8527278	Very interesting.
8529065	8530948	Is that it for emails tonight?
8532050	8532651	That would be it.
8533292	8534474	No more emails.
8534755	8535336	Sad face.
8535977	8539743	I think it's about time for the FUs of the week.
8539843	8541886	This is the part of the show where we get angsty.
8561247	8565851	F you to the day I've had and not having a tablet.
8568393	8568754	Loki?
8569594	8574459	Fuck you for the FBI going after Mega Upload because I actually did have files that I use on there.
8575219	8576721	And I also had a paid subscription.
8576981	8579323	Thankfully it wasn't that long of a paid subscription.
8579383	8586289	But it's annoying because I lost a lot of my files that weren't piracy related at all.
8586569	8588791	So yeah, that sucks.
8589031	8591233	and besides, yeah, taking down Mega Upload.
8591253	8592673	Really, that stopped all the piracy.
8592894	8593614	It's all gone.
8594174	8596856	There's not, like, file sharing sites everywhere else.
8597356	8597757	Oh, yeah.
8597957	8600779	You did a good job.
8600799	8604101	A lot of those file share sites block the U.S., which I thought was interesting.
8604461	8607603	Yeah, that's... You can get around that shit.
8607723	8608564	Oh, I'm sure you can.
8608644	8609724	Same way you do it in China.
8611986	8612266	All right.
8613298	8621344	Um, my FU of the week, I don't know, I don't really want too many details about it, but FU to uncertainty.
8621584	8622264	We'll leave it at that.
8623265	8628608	Alright, uh, let's go and do the listless results from Angry to Happy.
8630450	8630730	Oops.
8632471	8636654	Listless results, here it is as you guys voted the top three.
8636674	8638055	This is it, this is the definitive list.
8638075	8639796	These are the rumors that are coming next.
8640396	8641817	Or they're not true.
8644627	8649210	The PlayStation 4 is co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as a Mega Man teabagging you.
8649230	8649430	Excellent.
8661358	8662560	The number two answer.
8663581	8667084	The Wii U will steal your soul and feed it to Miyamoto.
8668145	8668646	Yay.
8669727	8675653	And lastly, the number one answer, the thing, this is it, this is the next rumor, and it's a thing.
8676468	8682637	The Wii U, where the console is the controller because it's a big number one foamy glove.
8683318	8683999	There it is.
8684680	8687143	How appropriate that number one is number one.
8688024	8691930	Ah, Alan, the chatter's rejected both your and I answers all the way.
8692688	8693208	Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim
8719246	8721428	Yes, and I cheat for gold, and I'm not sorry.
8721808	8722849	Did you take an arrow to the knee?
8723710	8723910	Yes.
8725511	8725771	Get out.
8726172	8726392	All right.
8730215	8732036	All right, there it is, your list list for tonight.
8732116	8738101	Just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the Twitter topics, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8738121	8739902	But not just yet, we have some more stories for you guys.
8740263	8740503	Loki?
8742321	8749486	Let's talk a little bit about Resident Evil 6 again, other than the fact that the logo sort of looks like giraffe-flatio.
8750286	8752028	Giraffe-flatio.
8754029	8755030	It rolls off the tongue.
8755050	8758352	Is that censored on Xbox, giraffe-flatio?
8761527	8766369	Anyways, so apparently it's the largest scale game ever made for Capcom.
8766409	8775593	It has 600 people involved and should be pretty expensive by the sounds of that.
8775893	8782396	Apparently, to put the numbers into perspective, Assassin's Creed 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 were completed by 450 people.
8782416	8784076	Well, 450 for Assassin's Creed 2, 1,000 for Grand Theft Auto 4.
8791451	8793873	So it would be pretty significant.
8795254	8797636	Of course, it could also be very buggy.
8797756	8798076	Who knows?
8799657	8802119	You ever heard the phrase, too many cooks in the kitchen?
8805101	8808804	I want to know how on earth that Resident Evil box art got out.
8808884	8812587	It's like nobody looked at the work that the designer did.
8813007	8814889	The designer screwed it all up.
8816778	8817659	I was trying to get a reaction.
8817699	8818480	I'm not getting anything.
8818741	8820543	She's just not paying attention to me.
8821845	8822706	I'm sorry, what?
8823287	8825089	I said for Resident Evil Resolations.
8825249	8827292	I'm surprised that that got out.
8827592	8829495	No, well, I'm talking about the box art for Resident Evil.
8829575	8832218	You said Resident Evil and my brain just went... Zzzz.
8833241	8862423	Resident Evil Revelations that box art went out with a misspelling and I was surprised how that happened and it got out and I said the designer didn't check their work it's all the designer's fault and the designer is to blame no I'll tell you what happened okay well yeah first of all the designer made a typo the designer should have caught that but also QA should have caught that marketing should have caught that distribution should have caught that the end
8863809	8871417	Anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to derail from Resident Evil 6, but I'm sure it'll be great, even if the logo looks like Giraffe Lay Show.
8875202	8877544	Hey, Steam has a new iOS client.
8877764	8879145	It's in beta right now.
8880085	8882527	But I found that it's actually pretty easy.
8882587	8883147	Well, I don't know.
8883227	8884008	Maybe I'm just lucky.
8884388	8888291	But I tried to log into the Steam iOS app and it said, sorry, you're not in the beta.
8888331	8889611	And I'm like, well, boo, you whore.
8889651	8890372	And I shut it off.
8890732	8893454	But then the next day I was like, well, I wonder if I'm in the beta yet.
8893554	8895916	I don't have an email, but I'm just going to try it anyway.
8896036	8897336	And sure enough, it let me right in.
8898117	8899418	So I'm able to get into the Steam app.
8899818	8900558	Beta App.
8901078	8902499	And here's what it basically lets you do.
8903899	8907741	Sorry, you're not going to be able to suddenly play Arkham City on your iPhone.
8907781	8908941	It doesn't do that.
8908981	8910281	You don't actually get to play the games.
8910682	8911962	But it's a front end for the store.
8912002	8913002	You can see the stores.
8913022	8913983	You can see the sales.
8914043	8918384	Of course, they want you to be able to spend your money right there from the wallet there.
8918844	8919584	Buy some games.
8920085	8921565	But here's something else that's interesting.
8921805	8923846	You can use the chat from Steam.
8924806	8951529	from your phone and I actually was doing that a little bit like I was on my phone in the other room and I started sending messages to Alan while he was playing Skyrim I was like lol ghost I'm not there to be doing this and so he figured out that I must have got into the iOS app but the chat functionality is pretty cool at least so and you can see what your friends are playing and I guess you can still look at things like screenshots and videos all on the go so the good news about that is is that like if you have this awesome Skyrim bug that you got a video of
8952049	8958794	You could get out your iPhone and say, hey, look at what happened to me in Skyrim, dude, and play it, and then it's right there.
8958814	8959514	So that's kind of cool.
8960695	8963717	I bet it's a matter of time before maybe we start seeing some game stuff.
8963757	8966820	I don't know if it'll be like the same games you see on –
8967580	8968521	DarkSakura.com
8995174	8996981	Yeah, maybe I should check and see if they let me in yet.
8997142	8997643	You never know.
8998487	8998788	Alright.
8999932	9000514	Moving on.
9000976	9001377	DarkSakura.
9002688	9002968	Me.
9003509	9004269	Oh yeah, that's right.
9004490	9004710	Me.
9005230	9006391	How about PixelJunk Eden?
9006511	9007452	Guess where it's going to be?
9008393	9009594	Steam!
9010334	9011295	As in Thursday.
9011415	9019462	This week, February 2nd, we will have PixelJunk Eden coming to PC on Steam.
9020262	9021103	So you can get it for $9.99.
9021864	9024806	It's the full game and the Encore DLC.
9025627	9027448	And you can get the soundtrack separately for $6.
9027488	9027748	Okay.
9032769	9035030	$6?
9033530	9035030	That's a bargain at half the price.
9036710	9038411	It is a bargain at half the price.
9038651	9040552	I'll wait for the 4th of July sale when it's going to be $0.75.
9040972	9042652	I know, right?
9043633	9045433	No, PixelJunk are pretty good games.
9046213	9051015	I found one of the PixelJunk games for PSP at RCWilly for $5.
9052350	9052950	What is R.C.
9052990	9053310	Willey?
9053330	9055391	Is that like a Big Lots type of store?
9055431	9058492	No, it's a huge, expensive furniture store.
9058852	9059713	And they have electronics.
9060113	9062253	Except they're owned by Mormons, so they're closed on Sunday.
9062694	9063194	That's weird.
9063734	9067075	Well, not the Mormon part, but the part about the whole, like, PSP games.
9067755	9068235	Kind of weird.
9069216	9069496	All right.
9069936	9072197	A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.
9072277	9072577	Loki.
9074938	9075318	All right.
9075718	9081240	And, see, the last thing we're going to talk about here... Well, the last thing I want to talk about is...
9083493	9084553	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9110163	9114907	which they came out afterwards because everyone's going, you know, what the fuck, you know, why?
9114927	9121371	I have to actually, you know, buy this game new to have, you know, the actual quest line for the game?
9121411	9122732	You know, that doesn't make any sense.
9123113	9130218	They're saying that, you know, we always wanted to put this game or this content out as free bonus content, um...
9131158	9131899	Thanks for watching!
9152196	9162521	What they really should have done is just put bonus DLC with your first run games.
9162641	9166483	It honestly would just be a different way of phrasing the same thing.
9166583	9168443	Yes, and people would not get pissed off.
9168804	9170424	They'd be like, you get this bonus.
9170905	9172825	No one's going to complain, oh, hey, guess what?
9173346	9178628	We're going to give the people that buy the new game our first content pack of DLC for free.
9179412	9181534	Everyone to be like, fuck yeah, that's awesome.
9181614	9184216	Thank you for rewarding people for buying it new.
9184576	9190040	But then you're saying instead that, oh, it's just, you know, it's an online pass.
9190060	9193342	You're making people feel like you're giving them something as opposed to taking something away.
9193502	9194023	Exactly.
9194123	9194683	That's what it is.
9195003	9196324	That's what it all boils down to.
9198542	9205849	Is that the same guy that's like the guy behind it who was like a big baseball player back in the day?
9224562	9227424	Well, Kurt Schilling is actually the head of the company, 38 Studios.
9227444	9229065	And isn't he the same guy that's posting online?
9229786	9231247	No, this is their community manager.
9231707	9233789	But yeah, he posted online some follow-up too.
9234169	9239573	But no, he said, you know, we wanted to post a quick clarification for something that we've seen a few comments on.
9239993	9247138	For what it's worth, the House of Valor content was not in the finished game disc at one point and then removed.
9247219	9251402	Okay, so it sounded like before that it was part of the finished game disc, but it's not.
9251422	9251602	Yeah.
9252182	9253243	They're saying that it isn't.
9253343	9255205	It's nothing that we're locking you out of.
9255386	9257388	It was supposed to be standalone download content.
9257508	9258249	Okay, well that's great.
9258549	9261492	So it was a situation where it was going to be free download content later on.
9261632	9265116	But don't fucking call an online pass because it still implies that you're taking something away.
9267148	9276315	I mean, I understand that EA calls their passes online passes, but just call it, like, a voucher for free DLC, because people won't get as pissed off about that.
9276376	9288986	I've heard the demo is pretty dreadful, like, just because it's so buggy, and they've actually apologized for the demo and all this, and it's kind of like, dude, why would you... I mean, I'm so shocked that companies allow this to happen.
9289086	9290467	Like, how did that happen?
9291228	9292629	If people up at the top are so...
9293949	9296070	I can't believe that we put out a product like that.
9296410	9302031	Oh my god, why would I give you $60 of my money to trust that I'm going to get a good time?
9302151	9302811	Let me put it this way.
9303032	9306352	This is what I've said about download passes and stuff like that.
9307713	9311794	Even though you're not getting this extra quest line, who gives a fuck?
9312014	9316475	Seriously, we're talking a bonus quest DLC thing that you may or...
9316855	9318456	I've heard some positive things about it though.
9318476	9320497	Some people say it is the game that everybody thought Fable would be.
9343416	9349469	Yeah, I mean, it looks cool, and I hate to see, like, games that kind of try something a little bit different, you know?
9349709	9352295	Sorry, was it supposed to be, like, multiplayer or MMO at some point?
9352912	9353472	I don't think so.
9353672	9354333	I thought it was.
9354353	9358354	There was supposed to be some type of multi-person element in it that went away.
9359315	9361916	But, I mean, I don't know.
9361976	9379484	Don't let the fact that this online pass is in there... Because I'd say for a game like Battlefield or something like that where you can't access the online portion, demoing it out used without paying for the online pass, that is kind of crippling because you can miss a whole portion of the game that...
9380184	9380485	DarkSakura,
9395361	9395682	I don't know.
9395882	9397403	It's whatever.
9397983	9398583	It is what it is.
9398904	9399504	Buy it or don't.
9400585	9400965	All right.
9401745	9404327	Lastly for you guys tonight, I don't know.
9404647	9408249	As a resident here in the state of California, this just pisses me off.
9408730	9415754	But California has agreed that they're going to reimburse the Entertainment Software Association just shy of $1 million.
9415814	9423579	That's $950,000 in legal fees for fighting Brown versus the EMA up to the Supreme Court.
9424820	9425160	Let's see.
9425621	9429186	The state negotiated that down from the $1.1 million.
9430627	9430928	Wow.
9431268	9434612	Now, there was already reimbursements previously for the case in 2008.
9435173	9440420	This means that California has paid out in total $1.3 million to the ESA.
9440920	9441982	Yeah, they're raising our tuition.
9443703	9455148	and I quote, Senator Yee and Governor Schwarzenegger wasted more than $1 million in taxpayer funds at a time when Californians could ill afford it, says Mike Gallagher, who is the president of the ESA.
9455548	9460290	However, we feel strongly that some of these funds should be used to improve services for California's youth.
9460390	9462891	So the ESA is just kind of like rubbing it in basically.
9463511	9475282	Now, the ESA did say they will donate a portion of the proceeds from the reimbursement to, quote, develop after-school educational programs for underserved communities in Oakland and Sacramento.
9475402	9476102	Hey, our backyard.
9477984	9489834	This new education initiative will start in the spring and, quote, harness young people's natural passion for playing and making video games and connecting them to the development of critical 21st century job skills.
9490555	9509586	Well, while that's all nice and good that the ESA is pouring some of that money back into the community, I'm a realist, and I know certainly not all of it is going back into the community, and that's my fucking tax dollars that just went to the ESA, which, if I remember right, is now an organization that was supporting SOPA and PIPA and all this stuff.
9509626	9512728	And it's like, I don't want my money going to lobby for this stuff.
9513068	9513749	Okay, fair enough.
9513789	9515110	They did withdraw, but...
9516130	9523692	I still feel like in some indirect way I paid to help lobby for Soba and Pippa for a short time and that kind of irritates me.
9523792	9533255	I'm really irritated and Senator Yi will not kind of give up this fight and I feel like he needs to be removed from office by vote.
9533295	9539517	Now sadly I don't live in a place that gets to vote for him or against him but I mean, sorry, he needs to go.
9540057	9544439	He wasted that money and so did the governor but the governor's already gone, thank God.
9546259	9547120	That was just a joke.
9548501	9558007	Look, I realize we're not a political show and people get very, very passionate and personal about political stuff, but I just... Governor Schwarzenegger was absolutely terrible for the state.
9558107	9558567	I'm sorry.
9558668	9559648	He was so bad.
9560088	9560729	So, so bad.
9561069	9566913	And if you need proof, here's one of many examples of how taxpayer dollars were just fucking wasted.
9567694	9570015	And now it's like the state is fucking broke.
9570355	9571936	Businesses are leaving this state.
9572177	9573638	They want to talk about upping taxes.
9573678	9574738	They're upping education.
9574898	9575479	I mean, like,
9577361	9582266	You know what's going to ultimately end Orange Lounge Radio?
9582386	9584368	I'm going to tell you.
9584489	9585910	You know what's going to ultimately end this show?
9586671	9589754	One of us is going to leave California because we can't afford to be here anymore.
9590315	9591456	It was almost that.
9591616	9593018	It was literally almost that.
9593078	9593218	Yep.
9594119	9620328	Dan wanted us to up and move to Washington and I begged I was seriously in a really bad way over that potential I can't do it I won't do it you barely dodged a bullet and you never know if heaven forbid myself, Loki lost our job and we could only find something somewhere else that'll be what ends the show
9620888	9621529	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
9645289	9646650	It's just absolutely ridiculous.
9646731	9657299	You know what I'm paying right now in junior college is just under what I was paying for my four-year school in 95.
9660662	9662164	I'm paying $36 a unit hour.
9662684	9665827	And I was paying about $42 at the University of South Alabama.
9666888	9667448	It's ridiculous.
9668329	9668489	Yeah.
9669545	9696728	so I know a lot of folks go oh California's all sunshiny and all this stuff but it's it can sometimes be a little bit sad there you go sorry I didn't mean to be Debbie Downer but that's where we live and that's an important story to talk about please do not let Senator Yee get re-elected he fucked up he would not let this go he would not let it go and I think he has to pay the price for it that's my thought
9697918	9698619	Let's take calls.
9698639	9702322	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9702342	9703103	That's all one word.
9703143	9706086	The Skype line is open and we are taking calls right now.
9706266	9706787	Although, I don't know.
9706807	9709590	After that downer of a topic, we might have scared everybody off.
9710070	9711271	So let's see if there's any tweets.
9714374	9715716	That's my wacky morning DJ noise.
9716809	9719571	Here's a... Let's talk... Let's do a story about pot.
9719712	9722414	That'll make everybody feel better, at least a lot more relaxed.
9722934	9723855	It'll make me throw up.
9724316	9733143	Tigerclaw has sent us a link to a story on Kotaku that says, Hey, you might want to get rid of those pictures of you smoking weed before you unload your Nintendo 3DS.
9733644	9735485	And you can imagine where this story goes.
9736446	9762945	um somebody bought an xbox off a craigslist or gamestop or whatever what what is this um oh it was from the uk where this happened where somebody inherited a used 3ds and on the 3ds was a picture of a dude smoking a bong which i believe is as illegal in the uk as it is here meaning technically it's illegal but you know most people won't do anything about it um but still i mean fucking if you're
9767540	9768561	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9768581	9768982	Who's this?
9769642	9771064	Hey, it's the one and only Ranma.
9771124	9772285	Hey, I haven't heard from you in a while.
9772305	9772666	What's up?
9773366	9773827	Not too much.
9773867	9775649	I've been around here and there, you know.
9775729	9776850	Oh, I bet you get around.
9780474	9780895	What's up?
9782897	9785560	Something interesting that happened to me and Jill Videa yesterday.
9786060	9786461	Do tell.
9787659	9790340	We played Dance Central for the very first time.
9791160	9792181	It took you this long?
9793101	9799843	I don't have a Kinect, and my sister who had a housewarming, she has a Kinect and a 360.
9799903	9807746	After she put her daughter down and the drinking kind of went a little crazy, she suggested instead of rock band, let's do Dance Central.
9807826	9810427	So it was all like, why the fuck not?
9811867	9812707	Why the fuck not?
9812747	9815748	So you played DDR and dance games for many years.
9815828	9817069	What did you think of Dance Central?
9819214	9824057	The main reason why I never played Dance Central is because I thought I would make a fool of myself.
9825078	9825919	Still did.
9826779	9828181	It was just as funny.
9828941	9838989	But I noticed that, to me, one song in Dance Central is equal to maybe my normal two or three song dance set in DDR.
9839029	9842592	Because when I was done, I felt like I was going to collapse completely.
9843399	9843699	Are you serious?
9843719	9843859	Mm-hmm.
9873038	9875680	Have you played, did you get to play the sequel, Dance Central 2 at all?
9876161	9893577	Yes, yes, because it was sitting there, my sister didn't finish that one, so we was all like, you know, we might as well help her, and popped it in, first song I did was Sandstorm Oh lordy I was like, oh, many a con, many a con Did you get to see the dance for Born This Way?
9896145	9898346	I believe somebody did do Born This Way.
9899107	9901628	It was pretty feminine, wasn't it?
9903368	9907150	Yes, but with enough alcohol, it's all good across the board.
9907230	9909891	Everything's all good with alcohol, that's for sure.
9910491	9916334	So did playing Dance Central make you go, maybe I want to get a Kinect after all?
9916934	9917955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9934260	9938903	Now, you mentioned it as part of the UK releases, the Rhythm Party.
9939163	9941264	Oh, I just totally missed it because I was focusing on something else.
9941284	9944186	Yeah, Rhythm Party is a game by Konami.
9944266	9946807	It's all the people that did Dance Masters on Xbox Live Arcade.
9948168	9951009	And it's some, like I saw the song list.
9951049	9957513	Naoki had the song list up, but it's seriously like a bunch of Konami originals and then Born This Way by Lady Gaga.
9957893	9960314	Like, they finally licensed, like, a big song.
9960674	9963855	And one other one, too, that caught my eye is, like, Celebration, I think.
9965015	9966876	Let me go look at Naoki's Facebook.
9966896	9969656	Because, yeah, it's like a $10 game.
9970737	9974098	I'm sure they're going to put DLC out on it or something, but it's coming out very soon.
9974658	9975318	Like, uh...
9976492	9977193	Was it this week?
9978093	9978473	Yeah, yeah.
9978493	9980594	Well, she read it for UK releases, so I think it's out here, too.
9982155	9982876	I'm trying to find it.
9982896	9983116	Where is it?
9983416	9983696	Here it is.
9984076	9993781	Rhythm Party, Born This Way, Every Little Step by Bobby Brown, YMCA by the Village People, the Desro featuring Vanilla Ice songs.
9993982	9995762	Yes, that happened, apparently, at some point.
9995803	9996043	What?
9997023	9997844	I would like to hear those.
9997864	9999224	Desro and Vanilla Ice?
9999284	9999985	For real, yeah.
10000385	10000625	Hold on.
10000665	10001886	Let me see if I can pull this up here.
10002987	10006949	Desro was one of the Konami in-house bands.
10007149	10007550	I think so.
10007590	10008590	Aren't they an in-house band?
10009090	10014954	They did Cobalt in Poppin' Music and Dancer in 2DX.
10017935	10020837	And don't forget, there's also Daikinkai in DDR, I believe.
10020857	10021657	Yeah, Daikinkai.
10021857	10022138	Oh, yeah.
10022518	10022878	Here we go.
10022918	10028821	This is a clip from Dance Dance Revolution 2, which has... Let's see if...
10035856	10037598	I'm so out of the loop on DDR stuff.
10037618	10038999	I'm kind of ashamed of myself.
10041522	10042863	I like it already.
10042963	10047768	It's a little bit repetitive here in the beginning.
10047828	10048769	It's good stuff.
10048809	10052572	That's not Vanilla Ice.
10052652	10052873	Hold on.
10052953	10054214	It does not sound like Vanilla Ice.
10055874	10056915	Actually, I kind of like it.
10056935	10057996	That sounds pretty good.
10058056	10062559	I love Des Rho, so... Wait a minute, isn't... There's a song called Say a Prayer, Des Rho featuring Maxi Priest.
10062639	10064320	Isn't Maxi Priest the guy from Faithless?
10064360	10065121	No, that's Maxi Jazz.
10085700	10087521	Maxi Priest is, I think, is a reggae singer.
10087581	10087921	Yeah.
10088201	10089542	Okay, I was like, I know I knew that name somewhere.
10089562	10093484	Maxi Priest did, um, there was a song that came out, like, in... Oh, yeah.
10093804	10095645	He's a British guy of Jamaican descent.
10095745	10095965	Huh.
10097826	10104068	But there was, like, that big single that came out, um... Close to You was the biggest song he had.
10105209	10105409	Huh.
10107321	10111483	Wow, so I didn't realize Desro was doing all these big collaborations.
10112103	10113763	I want to know if they're Konami in-house or not.
10113783	10115604	I'm sure the chat room is like screaming it out here.
10115644	10117145	I'm not really paying attention to chat.
10117825	10118605	A little chat.
10122046	10126368	Anyhow, sorry, I know you didn't call in to talk about the Xbox game, but now you know, right?
10126888	10128049	And knowing is half the battle.
10128389	10130309	Exactly, exactly.
10130810	10132830	All right, well, anything else you want to talk about with us tonight, Ranma?
10134870	10135410	It depends.
10135450	10137491	You want me on the phone for another five, six minutes?
10138771	10139171	Why?
10139271	10139891	What's it about?
10140591	10140891	Let's see.
10140971	10142812	I have a couple of other topics pretty much.
10142832	10143032	All right.
10143052	10144372	Let's try to do one more quick one.
10145272	10145512	Okay.
10145552	10146292	This is a quick one.
10146532	10150933	This turned into like a giant 100th poster on my friend's Facebook.
10150953	10152874	There was a discussion about this.
10153534	10157655	Do you believe that using a strategy guide is cheating in a game?
10157975	10159595	My personal opinion, it's not.
10162122	10169669	It's not cheating, but there's certainly a reward to some people for being able to do it without it.
10170290	10177477	For some people, it's more rewarding to do it without it, but not everybody gets that same sense of satisfaction.
10177937	10183603	I definitely used to be one of those people that's like, scoff, I don't need a stinking strategy guide to get through this game.
10183643	10185204	Don't insult my intelligence.
10185945	10187306	But now I'm like, eh, whatever.
10187426	10189106	Get out the iPhone.
10189166	10191507	Let's pull up GameFAQs and do that.
10191587	10191987	I found it.
10192788	10193408	For the record.
10194128	10202112	Desro is one of the many aliases of Osamu Migitera, along with D.Crew, PositiveMA, and MTO.
10202172	10204953	DesQ represents a collaboration of him and Taku.
10205933	10206173	Wow.
10206473	10210275	Osamu is known by his trademark hard rock sound and hard-hitting beats.
10210655	10215537	His songs have appeared in pop and music, Beatmania, Beatmania 2DX, Guitar Freakstormania, and Dance Dance Revolution.
10217202	10219423	Some strategy guides have cheats in them.
10245939	10246060	Mm-hmm.
10246080	10246300	Mm-hmm.
10260222	10260682	Who cares?
10261262	10263243	If it's a single-player game, cheat all you want.
10263663	10266023	You're the one that chooses how to spend your $60.
10266923	10269644	If you want to get there the hard way and get those rewards, then yay.
10270024	10276045	But if you want to just cheat your way through it and get all the video in it or whatever, then yay.
10276065	10276905	Whatever you need to do.
10277505	10278365	It's in MMOs.
10278385	10284607	But then, of course, they have strategy guides for MMOs, but I don't consider a Warcraft strategy guide cheating.
10284867	10286767	They bundle it in the Deluxe Edition.
10286787	10287047	Yeah.
10288086	10289848	would Blizzard allow that if it was cheating?
10290309	10303726	it's not cheating, it's just maps and shit and tips I said this and I walked away using a strategy guide or game guide is not cheating when you hack the game that's when you're cheating
10304514	10306234	I agree with that and I think we'll leave it at that.
10306434	10307795	Ranma, thanks so much for your call tonight.
10308195	10308875	Hey, no problem.
10308895	10309395	Take care, buddy.
10309775	10310055	You too.
10310175	10310795	Stay fabulous.
10311576	10312256	I will.
10312276	10319117	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10319137	10319918	Go ahead and give us a call.
10319938	10321578	We got time for at least like one more call.
10321678	10322058	Get in here.
10323798	10325259	Meanwhile, oh, I had more tweets.
10325279	10326179	There was at least one.
10326199	10327379	We didn't get a lot of tweets tonight.
10328079	10330120	I'm a little bit disappointed in you tweeters.
10332249	10333810	We will read one more from Tigerclaw, though.
10334350	10338811	Tigerclaw is always... You can always count on certain things in life.
10339231	10340331	You can count on taxes.
10340991	10343032	You can count on getting ripped off from vending machines.
10343812	10348153	And you can count on Tigerclaw posting two stories for the OLR Twitter every night, every Sunday.
10348713	10349273	All right.
10349874	10350374	Korea...
10351434	10356656	is considering a move that would block minors from playing online games for over three hours.
10356676	10358756	This is something Tiger Call linked us from Gamasutra.
10359276	10370740	The South Korea Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology is reviewing a policy that would ban minors' accounts if they play games for more than two hours consecutively or a total of three hours in a day.
10372080	10372760	What would you think of that?
10372780	10375941	What do you think about banning kids straight up from playing games?
10376121	10376782	We ban you!
10380336	10383138	Wasn't Ragnarok Online a Korean company?
10383678	10392043	By the way, there already is a law that prevents children under 18 from playing online games during the late nights, but this would be something else kind of new.
10392063	10394385	I'm trying to read through some of these quotes here.
10395325	10401269	If the game industry is really a troublemaker, then the related government should discuss it and provide guidelines to instruct us.
10401329	10404471	That was from a game industry representative who's trying to fight this.
10405211	10405651	Interesting.
10405671	10408413	Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.
10408453	10409394	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10409414	10409734	Who's this?
10410438	10411361	I'd like to do Zaku here.
10411501	10412705	Hey, Zaku, how you doing?
10413868	10419971	Pretty good actually, just resting up right now, getting ready for tomorrow's gruelish work week.
10420451	10421851	Tomorrow is a Monday.
10422612	10424032	Yeah, case of the Mondays, yeah.
10424312	10437758	Alright, anyways, aside from not calling in a while, I've been busy building a new PC, getting Battlefield 3 up and running, and just spending most of my time on that.
10438038	10440539	It's alright, I've been busy having pink eye like a three year old.
10442608	10444689	I wonder if you can still spread it over the internet.
10444909	10445409	Probably not.
10445609	10446449	Let's not find out.
10447290	10464416	But yeah, I guess aside from playing Battlefield 3, I kind of noticed that this whole spat on having to include online passes in games and the fact that Curt Schilling's video game company is still trying to do damage control over how they ended up describing it.
10465399	10472745	It brings up a fundamental shift in the fact that this wasn't the case several years ago, even in the previous generation.
10473606	10484955	Japan was the only country that really had it out for used games, to the point where, if I recall correctly, a Supreme Court decision over there paved the way for retailers to actually sell used games.
10485987	10488050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10502287	10503008	Thanks for watching!
10524159	10538201	I myself, I mean, I try not to buy, I try to buy it new, but if for some reason there's no compelling reason whatsoever to get it that quickly, I may just opt for a used copy like most of the other games I bought.
10539202	10544046	Most of them are just used second hands, except for the ones that I bought new, like Forza 4.
10544086	10547569	That was definitely worth buying just because of the value added.
10548150	10555856	The fact that it was something that they offered up not only just an impressive card list, but just some really good DLC off the bat.
10556817	10567166	But then you also get really mediocre games in which the only way they can really try to draw in people is to try to offer DLC that will make up for a lackluster game.
10569750	10572694	Yeah, I'm trying to think of a recent example of that.
10572914	10579883	And I know I'm thinking there's something that just came to my mind where DLC kind of helped add stuff in a game that was kind of lackluster.
10581403	10581764	I don't know.
10605967	10625743	Because once technology gets better to the point where Microsoft could actually pull off a system that detects used game copies, then to the point where it may not be viable to even sell any of those copies anymore.
10625823	10627884	That's assuming the system is successful.
10627944	10633209	And I think the consumer base at large will reject a system with those types of restrictions in place.
10633769	10642396	Then again, unless of course those restrictions are like you can't play used copies at all, which would be suicide for that manufacturer anyways.
10642696	10650923	But something that basically, instead of having a paper print out of an online passcode, something that gets activated for that particular account.
10651703	10661972	You know, like if you run the disc once and you need like an account, I guess like a gold account or something on Xbox Live where it would detect...
10662891	10666775	You already ran this particular copy of the game and you get that online pass.
10667215	10671579	So any other person running that game afterwards for a different account will have to pay.
10673061	10679487	So something like that, which takes a sting out of a draconian system that would just prevent used games from playing at all.
10680244	10684248	It's also insulting when I pay $60 for the game and I'm paying this premium.
10685229	10688772	I get with $0.99 or $1.99 games.
10688832	10690473	That's a digital license or whatever.
10690533	10693936	But with $60, I want my physical copy that I can take to a friend's house.
10693956	10694797	It's just ridiculous.
10695458	10698961	At some point, the consumers are going to say no to that.
10699021	10701323	So I think that whole thing was a load of bullshit anyway.
10701343	10702724	So why was the PSP Go not successful?
10722984	10727471	Well, I guess it's a factor in the sense that it was all digital.
10727872	10731518	Like people want, and you're right, you do bring up a point of having to...
10732338	10734400	I only buy on the sale unless I really need to have that copy.
10755117	10756498	I bought Civilization 5 at full price, that's it
10774130	10777552	Right now, I'm going to have to buy Skyrim full price because you know what?
10777572	10786259	The sale was not low enough in the sense that I could probably pick it up cheap later on, but if I wanted to play it right now, I would have to suck it up.
10786579	10787700	Same thing with Battlefield 3.
10787840	10788881	I bought that full price.
10789481	10791502	It was Origin, but nevertheless, I bought it.
10791522	10793984	I didn't wait for it to go on sale.
10794044	10797827	I wanted to play that now, and I still haven't bought the expansion pack yet.
10797987	10805233	I just want to point out, you don't have to shop around a little bit, because Steam is charging $59.99 still, I think, but I looked at Amazon, $47.46.
10805273	10810016	Well, that's the thing, Battlefield 3 is only on Origin, anything other than Steam.
10810617	10820785	Remember that whole spat where EA wanted to, because of what Valve set up in their terms, that they took most of their games away out of Steam and into Origin?
10820805	10822146	Yeah, but why get a digital copy then?
10822984	10844717	well because it sucks having you know it doesn't make a difference if it's activated through Origin because that's where all EA games are going you know at this rate so even if I have a digital copy it will only be tied to my Origin account just like Steam alright I gotta wrap up and let you go buddy but we'll hope that gaming manufacturers get the right idea of what we really want
10846193	10846915	Yeah, definitely.
10846995	10847455	Have a good one.
10847495	10848056	Alright, you too, buddy.
10849178	10850881	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10851341	10854466	We're running a little bit over tonight, so we're going to wrap it up and get on out of here.
10855167	10859895	But first, I want to go around and see if there's any last minute stories, DarkSakura or Loki.
10861137	10861297	Meh.
10861776	10863057	Nothing I really wanted to talk about.
10863337	10863457	No?
10863758	10864498	I don't know.
10864758	10873184	Like, DarkSakura, you wanted me to mention there was some gaming chair, not even really a gaming chair, but like some PC pod chair thing that, you know, that someone's trying to sell.
10873304	10880510	It's really expensive and sort of looks like, you know, some immersion rig from, you know, Ready Player One or something, but...
10881130	10881771	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
10882311	10883292	I saw that.
10883613	10884314	It's expensive.
10884614	10888398	And there was another story that he posted that was interesting about the whole world record.
10888438	10892722	Somebody spent like 40 hours trying to beat some DDR record and got denied by Guinness.
10893143	10897948	But it was a little bit too busy of a news week to fit something like that in, especially DDRs.
10898589	10900811	I saw one that was also – what was it?
10900911	10902292	Jimmy Kimmel – or not Jimmy Kimmel.
10903914	10910596	Jimmy Fallon did some really stupid record a while back where most consoles played in a minute.
10911596	10915658	I don't even know how you arbitrarily do that.
10915678	10917538	Press A, press A, press A. It's not even.
10917578	10918999	They had to do something for a second.
10919059	10920459	I don't even know what the requirements were.
10920499	10922060	It's like WarioWare in real life.
10922080	10928522	It's stupid, but then someone else apparently beat their record or they claimed to beat their record with 13 consoles played.
10929863	10930263	I don't know.
10930423	10931204	It's dumb.
10933105	10934526	You can't have a record on that.
10934546	10939150	What are you going to say that constitutes playing?
10939250	10940851	Just like pushing pause?
10940871	10941511	Pushing A?
10941631	10942032	I don't know.
10944233	10948116	We have had 16 consoles on in my house before.
10949597	10955702	Well, you need to do WarioWare IRL where you just run around all those and do something for a second on each one.
10959804	10963025	All right, we're going to go around, wrap up the show, and get everybody's final thoughts.
10963265	10964546	So where do we start?
10964946	10967467	DarkSakura, thank you for being here as always.
10967547	10969048	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
10969408	10969568	Al.
10971568	10972889	I'm going to go have some strudel.
10973700	10974160	Delicious.
10974800	10975881	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10976941	10980322	I really should play some more LittleBigPlanet 2.
10981703	10982563	I agree with that.
10982723	10983224	I hear that.
10983364	10984924	I just probably won't.
10985864	10988105	My final thought tonight is wow, wow, wow.
10988145	10988686	More wow.
10988746	10989426	Wow, wow, wow.
10990126	10992488	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

11013487	11015108	folks at Loki earlier this evening.
11017210	11019312	Say nice things about us on the internet and help spread the word.
