00:00.000 --> 00:20.360
Tonight, January 1st, 2012, DLC is finally coming to the 3DS, Valve says Half Life 3

00:20.360 --> 00:29.920
rumors are just trolling and a fan remake of a computer game classic is released.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.080
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.080 --> 00:41.820
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. It is episode number 440 for this January

00:41.820 --> 00:46.160
1st, 2012. Really easy day to remember. My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you

00:46.160 --> 00:50.360
over the next few hours to talk video games with my co-hosts, first off, the one, the

00:50.360 --> 00:56.120
only, Jamie Summers. Or Dark Sakura, whatever you want to call her. How are you doing?

00:56.120 --> 01:04.480
People get my name right. Bitter table for one. Not bitter. I'm judgmental. All right.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.960
Also joining us tonight, not joining us tonight. Sadly, I know this might surprise some people,

01:07.960 --> 01:12.040
but Tech Master Loki unfortunately had to cancel on tonight's show. Unfortunately. Well,

01:12.040 --> 01:16.680
you know, you miss him with every fiber of your being. No, I miss him with everything

01:16.680 --> 01:21.540
I throw. He had a family engagement. I mean, it is technically a holiday, New Year's Day.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.520
And so sometimes there's family stuff, especially with the new baby he's got. So they've got

01:25.520 --> 01:29.100
a family thing going on. So he's not here tonight. That baby is not as new as that baby

01:29.100 --> 01:34.860
once was. He better, he better have the baby thing down. That baby's getting older just

01:34.860 --> 01:41.000
like you and you, but joining us tonight as he tends to do when we need another host,

01:41.000 --> 01:46.400
please welcome to the studio. Alan, how you doing Alan? Hello. How are you? This is all

01:46.400 --> 01:51.400
happening in my house right now. I need to get out. Yes. Um, here's the deal. If we sound

01:51.400 --> 01:54.400
a little different tonight, we're kind of having to just adjust some audio on the fly

01:54.400 --> 01:58.540
and that's because we're in a new studio and we talked about this when we were last on,

01:58.540 --> 02:02.440
we did not have a show last week because it was on December 25th, which is a big holiday

02:02.440 --> 02:08.360
for some people. Uh, and the week before that though was our last show. And, um, w that

02:08.360 --> 02:13.280
was the last show from studio dark Sakura or the fifth studio in OLR's history. Yes.

02:13.280 --> 02:18.980
But tonight we are in a new studio at studio six and it's from Alan and I's place. Yep.

02:18.980 --> 02:27.080
So what, what's your grammar? What should be Alan and my house? How about shut and up?

02:27.080 --> 02:32.160
Uh, how about bite my butt? Anyhow, unfortunately I was really hoping to surprise everybody

02:32.160 --> 02:36.300
with the return of a webcam tonight, but it was just a bit pricey and, and logistically

02:36.300 --> 02:40.400
a pain in the butt to set up, but we are set up very similar to, for those who've been

02:40.400 --> 02:45.260
listening a long time, I believe it was the third, no second studio we were in, which

02:45.260 --> 02:49.360
was when Loki and I lived together. It was a while ago, right? We actually did the show

02:49.360 --> 02:52.740
kind of in the dining room and then the living room. There was antics that always happen.

02:52.740 --> 02:56.040
That's kind of a similar setup to what we have going on right now in this studio six.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.540
So we're hoping at some point we can return the live streaming of games and stuff during

02:59.540 --> 03:04.900
the show over one of them stream and video websites. We used to use Justin TV. I've done

03:04.900 --> 03:08.200
stuff on Ustream. I don't know. I don't know which way we'd go. We'll figure that out when

03:08.200 --> 03:11.720
we actually have video. I now have experience doing custom graphics for Justin for not for

03:11.720 --> 03:18.940
Justin TV for a Ustream. So, Hey, yep. Awesome. I did them for you for Umlaut. All right.

03:18.940 --> 03:24.480
Say hello to the chatters chat room dot orange lounge, excuse me, chat dot orange lounge

03:24.480 --> 03:28.100
radio.com. I'm a little rusty after we got chat dot orange lounge radio.com is where

03:28.100 --> 03:33.260
you can join us. Uh, if you want to talk live with us here on this new year's day and it

03:33.260 --> 03:38.100
looks like we have a Bobby Black Wolf. Did he just join? How come Bobby could show up

03:38.100 --> 03:42.020
for our show, but he couldn't be bothered to do his own show tonight. No, that's because

03:42.020 --> 03:46.720
he likes our show better. As, as I said to the all games chatters, Bobby didn't want

03:46.720 --> 03:51.000
to work. He just wanted to bang on the drum all day because he, that's a joke because

03:51.000 --> 03:56.400
he does drumming. He does drumming stuff for the Atlanta Falcons. So my mother is calling

03:56.400 --> 03:59.960
me on my cell phone right now. Like, doesn't she know I have a radio show on Sunday nights?

03:59.960 --> 04:04.700
Doesn't she know? Maybe she's listening. Rob, what do you mean you moved the show to your

04:04.700 --> 04:11.820
house? Rob, did that cost money? Rob, Rob. And you know, we are live of course, Sunday

04:11.820 --> 04:16.760
nights, every Sunday night, even when it's new year's day at all games radio is the kind

04:16.760 --> 04:20.260
and gracious network that allows us to steal their bandwidth no matter what studio we're

04:20.260 --> 04:25.480
in. Www dot all games.com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern. Typically after the

04:25.480 --> 04:29.240
Bobby Black Wolf show when he's, you know, not off drumming tonight after the show, our

04:29.240 --> 04:34.240
nine cast, they had a jumbo episode cause they are usually on it for Pacific and they

04:34.240 --> 04:40.820
went long. They had an extended edition. They like it long. That's right. So anyhow, um,

04:40.820 --> 04:44.360
let's start off with some topics tonight. I thought we could talk a little bit about

04:44.360 --> 04:48.160
some of the stuff we did yesterday on new year's eve. Now we didn't party together sadly.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.640
Um, it just didn't work out that way, but we did spend the day together and one of the

04:51.640 --> 04:55.520
things we did during new year's eve was we went to the flea market. That was awesome.

04:55.520 --> 05:02.340
Except I didn't buy any fleas. I think I might've caught a couple, but the flea market is basically,

05:02.340 --> 05:04.640
I don't know how to describe it for those that have never been. I imagine everybody's

05:04.640 --> 05:07.660
been to one at some point in their town, but then some people might not live in places

05:07.660 --> 05:11.560
big enough that have them. I don't know, but they're basically like gigantic garage sales.

05:11.560 --> 05:17.480
Is that an accurate description? Alan? Well, yeah, I guess you could say that a lot of

05:17.480 --> 05:22.520
the wares are new and handmade though. It's not all recycled junk, but I'd like to think

05:22.520 --> 05:29.000
of it as a giant thrift store. Yeah. Yeah. That works. So huge farmer's market, probably

05:29.000 --> 05:32.520
the biggest farmer's market I've ever seen. Yeah. The one here we have locally in the

05:32.520 --> 05:36.620
Sacramento area is just gigantic. So, um, you know, one of the things that's fun to go shopping

05:36.620 --> 05:41.120
for is produce and we have a blood oranges. So the other thing that's fun to go shopping

05:41.120 --> 05:44.340
for is like video games cause like there's a lot of people that will bring out their

05:44.340 --> 05:50.160
old shit. And even I saw like arcade machines for sale in some of the, um, junk and some

05:50.160 --> 05:55.360
of the little like, um, side, they have like a side auction. It's weird. So in the side

05:55.360 --> 06:00.840
auction they had, um, it's technically a different one. It's auction town. Yeah. So it's not

06:00.840 --> 06:07.840
part of deniers where we went. Well, we saw burger time for $950 like a legit arcade cabinet

06:07.840 --> 06:11.700
was in good shape. It was, it was pretty good for its age. Considering that game is from

06:11.700 --> 06:17.800
what 82 maybe it was somewhere around there. 82, 83. Considering that game is like as old

06:17.800 --> 06:22.840
as it is, that that machine was in beautiful condition. It was $950 and I was like, Alan,

06:22.840 --> 06:26.560
did you see what was on the other side of the machine next to it? No. What was that?

06:26.560 --> 06:31.440
A berserk in just as good condition. Wow. Like that's the old one with the little bouncing

06:31.440 --> 06:36.840
ball, like the little happy face. Good times. But we did buy video games. At least I know

06:36.840 --> 06:41.200
I bought video games. I bought Sing Star Queen, which I've talked about on the show before

06:41.200 --> 06:44.080
that I wanted it, but I wasn't going to get it until it went on sale. Well, I guess I

06:44.080 --> 06:47.120
forgot to get it amongst all the other video games that came out last year cause it was

06:47.120 --> 06:52.480
a crazy year and I bought Sing Star Queen for eight bucks at the flea market. That was

06:52.480 --> 06:56.200
awesome. And it was, it was, it was sealed. It might've been like resealed. Sometimes

06:56.200 --> 06:59.240
the stuff at the flea market, like they've used the little machinery seal it, but it

06:59.240 --> 07:03.920
worked fine. I played it the other day. Uh, and then I bought get this just because I

07:03.920 --> 07:08.400
wanted it and it was in the box of half off stuff. We actually have a super Nintendo hooked

07:08.400 --> 07:12.160
up that works and it's in good condition. I mean, it doesn't look like it's in good

07:12.160 --> 07:16.160
condition cause the super Nintendo is like Brown, but it works. That's the important

07:16.160 --> 07:20.780
thing. I bought clue for the super Nintendo. Remember the old ass board game. They made

07:20.780 --> 07:25.540
a port of it on super Nintendo that was kind of like, it didn't play exactly like the board

07:25.540 --> 07:30.160
game. Like it kind of put this logic puzzle twist on it where it would tell you like the

07:30.160 --> 07:34.800
lead pipe was in the conservatory and you have to kind of like tie it all together.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.920
So if, if Ms. Peacock was in the conservatory, then she must've had the lead pipe, you know,

07:38.920 --> 07:45.320
that whole thing. So, um, yeah, good times. So it was cool to play retro games and a favorite

07:45.320 --> 07:48.360
of mine was clue on the super Nintendo for no particular reason. It wasn't really that

07:48.360 --> 07:53.120
great of a game, but it's, you know, one I remember. So dark soccer. What did you, did

07:53.120 --> 07:58.400
you pick up any games? I did. I got one game. I got moral combat, the new one on PS three.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.800
Nice because Dan was complaining about not having any more PS three games. So, um, I

08:02.800 --> 08:05.960
got the form. We didn't play it yet. I mean, I know later on we're probably going to do

08:05.960 --> 08:10.640
our, how was our gaming week? Of course we always do. Yes. Um, but I picked that up and

08:10.640 --> 08:19.080
I got blood oranges and D and um, dried pineapple and you bought a shit ton of tortillas. I

08:19.080 --> 08:24.280
did. And we ate them all last night. Oh my God. That tortilla lady took you to the cleaners.

08:24.280 --> 08:30.360
You bought like two for three. That's not bad. Two bags. And there were six in each.

08:30.360 --> 08:34.720
So what I did, I did what she suggested with the, I got pumpkin tortillas, which were amazing

08:34.720 --> 08:38.160
because pumpkin, everything is awesome. You know, it would be OLR if we didn't have a

08:38.160 --> 08:42.800
food tangent, but I wrapped vanilla ice cream and then rolled them up and put them in the

08:42.800 --> 08:46.580
freezer and chopped and sliced them. Oh my God. That sounds good. They were amazing.

08:46.580 --> 08:52.320
They were gone. They vanished. And then I made, um, uh, black bean and cheddar quesadillas

08:52.320 --> 08:57.780
with and the, the tortillas were black bean and garlic and they vanished like they didn't

08:57.780 --> 09:01.980
last 15 minutes. So I'm just, I've decided we need to make flea market shopping a regular

09:01.980 --> 09:06.720
thing because like we have a super Nintendo and I think, I think Alan has secretly not

09:06.720 --> 09:10.080
so secretly, cause I'm about to share it on the radio, express to me that he would like

09:10.080 --> 09:14.240
to build a collection someday that rivals the vault.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.320
I think you're projecting a little bit, a little bit. Well, the thing is, is that I

09:19.320 --> 09:23.320
had a lot of amazing super Nintendo games with the box and instruction booklet and they

09:23.320 --> 09:27.300
were all in perfect shape cause I treat my stuff very well. I, they've all been sold

09:27.300 --> 09:32.200
on eBay years and years ago for a lot of money and I was kind of reminded actually of the

09:32.200 --> 09:36.200
price of how some of those games go for at the flea market. Cause there was a, was it,

09:36.200 --> 09:41.400
was it the super nest luffia was like 80 bucks one for that cart. So yeah, there's still

09:41.400 --> 09:44.880
some rare stuff out there. I used to have them, but I got rid of them. So you know,

09:44.880 --> 09:48.880
you guys are welcome to borrow. If you have the wild hair to play anything, you're welcome

09:48.880 --> 09:52.040
to borrow anything. I've got, I think most stuff on the super Nintendo, like I don't

09:52.040 --> 09:56.520
know, like it's, it's really like I'll get a, just an, an urge to just play it. Like,

09:56.520 --> 10:00.680
you know, I don't usually, I'm usually trying to play the new stuff cause you keep on top

10:00.680 --> 10:04.700
of stuff. It's very rare that I'm like, Oh, I just, I want to go play clue on the super

10:04.700 --> 10:08.360
Nintendo like, but when it's right in front of me, I go, I remember how cool this game

10:08.360 --> 10:13.000
was. I needed, I need to just pick this up and take it home cause half off. I paid six

10:13.000 --> 10:17.440
50 for it, which considering it was still in a box with the manual, I mean it wasn't

10:17.440 --> 10:22.260
new obviously, but they, they shrunk rapid to make it look new, but you know, whatever,

10:22.260 --> 10:26.400
you know, it was a good deal. So I was happy. Well, I've actually, it's funny that you mentioned

10:26.400 --> 10:30.840
that cause I was thinking since Dan and I are a quest to play through every final fantasy

10:30.840 --> 10:38.040
game in a row has a died. I was, how many did you get through? Not even one. We were

10:38.040 --> 10:43.000
toward the end of what we just got. Um, when we last played the, everyone got their upgrades.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.360
You got through final fantasy one, two, that's final fantasy half. Anyway, as something about

10:50.360 --> 10:56.160
just starting off with six, sitting down and just jumped to the good stuff, going through

10:56.160 --> 11:00.240
six, although I think four is amazing. So it's like four, don't get me wrong, but six

11:00.240 --> 11:03.840
is one that, you know, we'll, we'll just take turns with because I know that game like the

11:03.840 --> 11:08.260
back of my freaking hand, I've played through that game so many million times or chrono

11:08.260 --> 11:12.480
trigger because then it's just a matter of new game plus. Let me go to our chat room

11:12.480 --> 11:16.240
at chat.orangelaunchradio.com. Interesting kind of discussion going on in the chat room

11:16.240 --> 11:19.680
tonight, kind of about the durability of consoles because I mentioned the super Nintendo and

11:19.680 --> 11:23.480
the fact that, you know, it's still working and that led to some comments in chat room.

11:23.480 --> 11:28.080
Uh, Yuki, I hope I'm saying that right in our chat room, uh, says my super Nintendo's

11:28.080 --> 11:33.280
SNS is plural. Super Nintendo's never die. Those things are pretty durable and I thought

11:33.280 --> 11:37.240
this is interesting. Kai's Judo kind of followed up a little later with the sad thing is 20

11:37.240 --> 11:41.240
years from now, I doubt many people will say they have a PlayStation three or Xbox three

11:41.240 --> 11:47.560
60 that still works. How true. I mean the old systems were quite durable, weren't they?

11:47.560 --> 11:51.760
I mean, and they were all just hard plastic with a little green circuit board in it, right?

11:51.760 --> 11:57.120
Many moving parts. I think Dan said that they had dropped a super Nintendo down two flights

11:57.120 --> 12:02.360
of stairs and it still worked when he was a kid. Those things are rocks. I mean they

12:02.360 --> 12:07.440
were, but yet an Xbox three 60, you're lucky to get one that never red rings. You knock

12:07.440 --> 12:14.160
it over once onto the carpet and it's dead. That's true. They sure don't build them like

12:14.160 --> 12:17.540
they used to, but of course a lot of that could be, to be fair, you know, we did make

12:17.540 --> 12:22.560
a conversion somewhere along the way from CDs or excuse me, from cartridges to CDs,

12:22.560 --> 12:26.920
therefore DVDs, therefore Blu-rays, you know, that was a pretty major shift in, you know,

12:26.920 --> 12:32.880
format. Well, you can even see just in model releases, they go from being super sturdy,

12:32.880 --> 12:37.880
like I have a first model PS3 and it's still in perfect condition. It still plays everything

12:37.880 --> 12:43.220
wonderfully well, but then you get the newer ones, the slims, and they're just, they feel

12:43.220 --> 12:49.800
like nothing. They've got no durability. They're missing options and they cost, you know, when

12:49.800 --> 12:53.920
they were coming out, they were costing as much as the old models did. You know, I found

12:53.920 --> 12:57.240
my Japanese PlayStation 2 the other day and we were cleaning up, setting up for the studio.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.640
I found it and I kind of wanted to hook it up and play some old school BeatMania 2DX,

13:00.640 --> 13:05.880
but the problem is like you, they don't work through component cables. All the styles before

13:05.880 --> 13:10.320
I think 6 don't work through component cables. Like it just, no signal. This is the weirdest

13:10.320 --> 13:16.000
thing. Yeah. Well, and by the way, I have something that I wanted to lend you. My keyboard

13:16.000 --> 13:20.240
mania keyboard so you can do double. Oh, awesome. Cause I do have keyboard mania. I was going

13:20.240 --> 13:24.040
to say if you wanted to hold onto it and do doubles, you're going to have to get out my

13:24.040 --> 13:27.620
PlayStation 2 anyway. So yeah, flea market shopping. That's one of the things, fun things

13:27.620 --> 13:34.840
we did. And I also, I saw in chat, act def says a friend shops on a flea market swap

13:34.840 --> 13:38.840
meets and resells the stuff he finds on eBay for a living. I believe dark soccer was actually

13:38.840 --> 13:42.680
talking to one of her friends there that she used to buy a lot of stuff from who said that

13:42.680 --> 13:46.040
he doesn't have trader Dan trader and he doesn't have a really because he knows that if they

13:46.040 --> 13:50.800
haggle with him, they're just trying to. Yeah. Remarket it on eBay. So that's exactly what

13:50.800 --> 13:55.320
he said. And he's actually said he stopped dealing on eBay and he's doing like on E E

13:55.320 --> 13:59.360
trader or something. Some website. Yeah. I caught that end of the conversation. He seemed

13:59.360 --> 14:04.520
very irritated with eBay and Amazon. I'm not sure what happened there. I mean, Amazon,

14:04.520 --> 14:11.360
he used to just completely resell every everything, all the good stuff on, on eBay. Well then

14:11.360 --> 14:15.440
didn't Amazon kick everyone in California out because the whole tax thing, I don't know.

14:15.440 --> 14:21.640
I think they did. I don't think he did Amazon. I think he was strictly eBay and Yahoo. Hmm.

14:21.640 --> 14:25.960
Very interesting. All right. Um, I, I like this comparison. Very interesting comparison.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.680
Then we'll move on with how was your gaming week here in the chat room, uh, from SEP,

14:29.680 --> 14:35.760
win, uh, CEP win in the chat, a chat.org.com says it's like buildings. Do you think the

14:35.760 --> 14:41.760
biggest NFL stadiums will be around a hundred years from now, let alone 2000 as the Roman

14:41.760 --> 14:50.280
Colosseum? Well, here's an example. Um, I'm sure I've made no thing. I'm from mobile Alabama.

14:50.280 --> 14:56.060
We have a building that was recently restored that was built in like 1850 something. Um,

14:56.060 --> 15:04.640
you know, maybe after the city was like 150 years old and um, it's still in, even when

15:04.640 --> 15:10.880
it was run down, it was still in sturdy condition and lived through years of hurricanes, a hundred

15:10.880 --> 15:15.020
years worth of hurricanes where we had, you know, some of the newer buildings had been

15:15.020 --> 15:20.960
flooded down and were corroded and everything. So just even as an example in a couple hundred

15:20.960 --> 15:25.880
years, you know, construction, we're, we're leaning towards cheaper things that they don't

15:25.880 --> 15:29.160
last. Well, a lot of stuff is built for the environment too. Like here in California,

15:29.160 --> 15:34.000
you don't have brick buildings because of earthquakes. Yeah. So, but, um, in Alabama

15:34.000 --> 15:38.380
you almost everything is made out of brick and concrete. It's just interesting. And buildings

15:38.380 --> 15:46.320
are cheaper there, ironically, even though they'll last through probably more hard weather

15:46.320 --> 15:49.700
than California sees. It's also part of the reason why San Francisco buildings are very

15:49.700 --> 15:53.280
unique and you don't see buildings like it anywhere else is because San Francisco's weather

15:53.280 --> 15:58.220
and layout for a town is really unlike anyone else. Like the Hills in San Francisco are

15:58.220 --> 16:02.840
crazy and just, you know, anyhow, I don't know how we got from video games to that,

16:02.840 --> 16:07.040
but whatever. Well, construction. Yeah. Alan, did you, you didn't end up buying anything

16:07.040 --> 16:11.480
at the flea market, but anything catch your eye that like if you, you know, had the money

16:11.480 --> 16:17.760
burning a hole in your pocket, you wanted a trader. Dan had a lot of, um, big promotional

16:17.760 --> 16:22.840
standee things. Like he had that big Samus super Metroid thing that was like six or seven

16:22.840 --> 16:26.000
feet tall from super Metroid. Oh yeah. You know, I wanted that for the new studio. It's

16:26.000 --> 16:30.480
probably not for sale cause he has a mounted way up high on the wall. Yeah. But uh, yeah,

16:30.480 --> 16:35.920
I don't know. He'd sell almost anything if you offer him the right amount. So, well no,

16:35.920 --> 16:40.400
cause we've bought some stuff that was just on the collection wall before. So, but that

16:40.400 --> 16:43.600
was back when he had the store in Rio Linda. Well, you know, we put some pictures of the

16:43.600 --> 16:46.740
new studio up at orange launch radio.com. There's a little picture bar towards the top

16:46.740 --> 16:50.600
of the screen and you can kind of see some pictures that we take. I know what the website

16:50.600 --> 16:53.800
says. You can send in your own pictures, but due to some abuse things we had happen a couple

16:53.800 --> 16:57.080
of months ago, we had to pull that. So it's only the hosts really that are adding stuff

16:57.080 --> 17:01.920
to that. And we just added a bunch of pictures from the studio. So there's, you know, you

17:01.920 --> 17:05.280
can see the scrolls and things like that. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. But it was funny

17:05.280 --> 17:11.600
looking at the flea market at the big collections of uh, the game gear and the Atari links at

17:11.600 --> 17:16.940
both the console and the cartridge. How did anyone ever try to market that as portable?

17:16.940 --> 17:22.300
Either system. They were both huge. Well look at an old school Gameboy. Remember the commercial

17:22.300 --> 17:26.320
with the guy sitting on the toilet playing the links? Yeah. And I had a game gear and

17:26.320 --> 17:30.880
I remember it, it went through four double A batteries probably every 72 hours. And it's

17:30.880 --> 17:35.360
like worst battery life than a 3d. It weighs four pounds. Like how is that ever? But yeah,

17:35.360 --> 17:38.700
that was, it was, it was neat seeing all of that really old hardware. Go look at an old

17:38.700 --> 17:43.200
school Gameboy. Like those things are fucking bricks. But I remember you would have the

17:43.200 --> 17:47.520
case for it. Now we put it in a backpack and take it to school and that it was portable.

17:47.520 --> 17:52.280
You know, back then had an inspiration, Rob. What? You know how the people built the house

17:52.280 --> 17:58.300
out of Legos? Like an entire house. Yeah. Damn. Well it was, it was a sort of like an

17:58.300 --> 18:03.240
installation art piece, but you can actually pay to stay in it. Um, I want, I just had

18:03.240 --> 18:10.020
a picture of the laptop, by the way. Um, I want to build a house out of Gameboys.

18:10.020 --> 18:16.360
It might be tricky. An entire house. You might be able, you might be able to get a doggy

18:16.360 --> 18:21.400
house. Well, you know, like maybe like a little office or a storage room or something, but

18:21.400 --> 18:28.120
I think that, or even just do a wall, a wall of Gameboys, like modern art piece. Yeah.

18:28.120 --> 18:33.400
Instead of, you know, the eight bit, uh, gaming exhibit that they do, you know, instead of

18:33.400 --> 18:40.680
tile, you know, with, uh, the plaster tile plaster, do plaster and Gameboys. All right,

18:40.680 --> 18:44.320
let's move on. We got to talk about our gaming week or two weeks. Uh, it may be, we always

18:44.320 --> 18:47.880
like to, uh, at the top of the show or near it, uh, talk about the video games that we

18:47.880 --> 18:53.300
have been playing this week. Dark Sakura. Uh, how was your gaming week? Wow. Lots of

18:53.300 --> 18:59.920
world of Warcraft. Actually, not a lot because my computer was off for close to a week and

18:59.920 --> 19:03.000
then we just got our cable back. Well, yeah, you had new interwebs for like four days.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.800
I had to come over here on Christmas day. I remember that. To get my damn merry maker

19:08.800 --> 19:12.440
achievement. Open presents under the tree and iron forge. Yes, I remember that because

19:12.440 --> 19:15.960
then we went out, we went, we went out for, you know, nothing's open on Christmas, but

19:15.960 --> 19:20.680
we were able to find that pho was open on Christmas. So I, as, as a proper Jew, I had

19:20.680 --> 19:25.680
Asian food on Christmas day, even if it wasn't Chinese. I remember putting a tweet or something.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.720
I was like two gays and a Jew walk into a pho bar on Christmas. Yeah, it was, it was

19:29.720 --> 19:34.760
delicious. Yeah, it was very good. Delicious. And um, I played, well, once everything got

19:34.760 --> 19:41.600
hooked up, I played a little bit of, um, fractal, which I, I really like that game. Yeah. You

19:41.600 --> 19:46.120
talked about that last week on the show or two weeks. Yeah. Very pretty. And um, we played

19:46.120 --> 19:50.720
rock band of course. Um, like we do every party that we have the quintessential party

19:50.720 --> 19:56.040
game. Yes. And Bradley came over. Oh, Arcadia 42. Yes. We need to get him over here in the

19:56.040 --> 20:01.060
new studio and he, um, brought symbols and then he proceeded to impress, uh, the cousins

20:01.060 --> 20:09.640
with his prowess in pro drum mode. Oh, he does the pro drumming. Very cool. And, um,

20:09.640 --> 20:14.540
we had a, well, when I left the house, Dan was watching a play through of Gradius on

20:14.540 --> 20:20.360
the, uh, game boy, like the old school Gradius on the game boy. Cause I saw a little Moai

20:20.360 --> 20:27.380
heads. Um, we did, um, I think we did have a little bit of proteus going on in the house.

20:27.380 --> 20:33.120
So that was fun. But mostly it was just putting up games. So I've probably touched, uh, a

20:33.120 --> 20:38.460
couple thousand games this weekend, literally touched them. Right. But as for playing them,

20:38.460 --> 20:41.160
that's a different story. And then there's also the flea market games that you touch.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.680
You put your paws on a lot of those too, digging through that. So yeah, I, I really did try

20:45.680 --> 20:50.640
to, is sad going to trader dance though, because the stuff that he had out, the stuff I would

20:50.640 --> 20:55.680
have wanted was a stuff I already have. So I'm like, well see, that's why I was asking,

20:55.680 --> 21:01.640
you know, who had, um, master system, a master system because we have spare games. We do

21:01.640 --> 21:05.320
literally have spare master system games, which by the way, any of our listeners, if

21:05.320 --> 21:11.920
you have a master system, send me a photo of your master system. And the first person

21:11.920 --> 21:16.320
that sends me a picture of their own personal master system will get a game. Where can they

21:16.320 --> 21:20.560
email that? Cause you don't have an OLR email email bag at orange.radio.com show email.

21:20.560 --> 21:26.720
All right. Mail the mail, the mailbag. And it has to be your master system. Don't Google

21:26.720 --> 21:30.240
the picture. Maybe, maybe they need to put the, you need to tell them to put a little

21:30.240 --> 21:34.280
post it note that says OLR. So we know they didn't like Google it. OLR put it has to have

21:34.280 --> 21:38.760
a post note and, and keep in mind, I'm a designer. I can tell if you photoshopped it or something,

21:38.760 --> 21:42.720
you know, if you don't have posted notes for sake, just scribble it on a notepad or something.

21:42.720 --> 21:47.880
And maybe I'll be kind enough. And if you've got a power base converter, I'll accept that

21:47.880 --> 21:55.040
as well. All right. Anyhow, uh, inadvertent contest here on the show. Uh, Alan, why don't

21:55.040 --> 21:59.920
you go next? No Loki tonight. So it's been several months since I've been on OLR. So

21:59.920 --> 22:05.640
I've actually completed a lot of games. Um, if you remember dragon age origins that came

22:05.640 --> 22:11.040
out in 2009, a couple of months ago, I fired that up and I just couldn't let it go. I,

22:11.040 --> 22:16.040
between that and the expansion awakenings, I completed both of those. Um, I think I've

22:16.040 --> 22:20.640
logged nearly a hundred hours on my Archer ranger rogue that I rolled. I never realized

22:20.640 --> 22:24.440
you finished awakenings. Like I saw that you moved on to dragon age two at one point and

22:24.440 --> 22:27.560
I was like, Oh, maybe he just finally got ADD and he was like, I gotta go play the sequel.

22:27.560 --> 22:32.780
I didn't realize you finished awakening. I used a pretty much with any RPG. Now I use

22:32.780 --> 22:36.400
a FAQ or a walkthrough to play it just because I'm old and lazy and I don't want to miss

22:36.400 --> 22:41.440
things the first way through. There's something secret. So yeah, I used facts. Um, dragon

22:41.440 --> 22:47.200
age oranges was about 70 hours and awakenings was about 24 hours before I beat it. Um, see

22:47.200 --> 22:53.160
I played a little dragon age two, which got derailed by Skyrim cause steam had Skyrim

22:53.160 --> 22:58.320
for 40 bucks for 24 hours during its holiday sale, which for the game that a lot are calling

22:58.320 --> 23:01.980
game of the year that just came out a couple of months ago is a steal. Yeah. So 40 bucks

23:01.980 --> 23:07.960
for Skyrim, which I'm still, is what I'm actively playing. Um, just a PSA, the live listeners,

23:07.960 --> 23:12.200
the Encore sales going on today and that is 40 bucks again. They brought Skyrim back for

23:12.200 --> 23:15.800
40 bucks. That'll be, that'll be it like 10 AM tomorrow. It's gone. If you're listening

23:15.800 --> 23:19.480
to this on the podcast, you probably missed it already. Yeah. Well then the nice thing

23:19.480 --> 23:23.360
about studio six being in my house is that the podcast will be up like 30 minutes after

23:23.360 --> 23:28.280
the show's done. So especially the folks overseas, but I don't think the overseas folks can get

23:28.280 --> 23:32.800
the steam sales. I'm not sure. How does that work? Do you know dark soccer? I really don't

23:32.800 --> 23:36.360
know. I'll have to ask. I'm curious if the folks, do we have any chatter? I'm going to

23:36.360 --> 23:41.000
have to go home now and check my steam. I can't do it during the show unless there's

23:41.000 --> 23:47.300
steam for Linux now. I don't know. Uh, I'm here. Yeah. Did the folks in chat know is

23:47.300 --> 23:53.040
do we have any, I see Aki ripper in chat. I get ripper. Can you steam Sweden close enough?

23:53.040 --> 23:56.860
You might be able to log into the steam website and buy something on the website on your account

23:56.860 --> 24:00.040
and then it'll download to the client. Just wait till you get home until 10 AM tomorrow.

24:00.040 --> 24:04.480
But um, yeah, so I'm kind of juggling dragon H two and Skyrim right now and those are both

24:04.480 --> 24:10.080
pretty meaty meals of a game. So I don't know how long I'm going to be able to juggle those

24:10.080 --> 24:17.160
two. I got a DSI XL for Christmas for my lovely, kind, generous boyfriend and studio. Um, and

24:17.160 --> 24:22.820
because of my DSI XL, I've been playing warrior where touched. Can we back up a minute? Because

24:22.820 --> 24:25.480
this certainly caught me off guard. Cause I asked you, I said, what do you want for

24:25.480 --> 24:29.520
Christmas? And you said you wanted a DSI XL. I'm like, you, you, you want that even though

24:29.520 --> 24:34.240
it costs as much as a three ds. So just for the, for the listeners that might be asking

24:34.240 --> 24:39.280
the same question, why an XL? Why now? You got to answer, well, you have a three ds and

24:39.280 --> 24:48.360
I can play yours when you're at work. Honest answer. Um, that, and I have a thing, I almost

24:48.360 --> 24:54.040
have a thing against Nintendo, but the first generation of their little hardware portables,

24:54.040 --> 24:59.200
I thought the ds original, the ds fat was ugly and it looked cheap. And the ds light

24:59.200 --> 25:02.320
was like, Oh, okay, this looks like a good device. That's when I finally got on board

25:02.320 --> 25:09.260
with the ds was with the light. I just think with the weird analog stick on the right side

25:09.260 --> 25:15.680
attachment that came out for the three ds, um, I'm just, I want the second generation.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.360
And when I play Mario Kart seven on your three ds, I can only do two races before my right

25:20.360 --> 25:25.740
hand is completely cramped. Cause I have a big giant spindly spidery man hands and it

25:25.740 --> 25:31.920
hurts to play. So I have my giant ds XL and I've got a ton of ds games, RPGs that I haven't

25:31.920 --> 25:37.320
played. So all right. Fair enough. Yeah. And now when you explain it to me, it made a lot

25:37.320 --> 25:40.960
of sense. I was all right. And plus now, now that I've really got my pause on one of those,

25:40.960 --> 25:44.760
it's a really nice device. It's a nice device. It's kind of a bummer. It was so late in the

25:44.760 --> 25:48.200
life and now a lot of folks have moved on cause you know, it's a pretty rock solid ds.

25:48.200 --> 25:52.800
I just want to take a step back for just a minute and a chat. Hers have clarified act

25:52.800 --> 26:00.560
deft from Mexico steam sales work worldwide. There you go. So, um, so aside from Mario

26:00.560 --> 26:07.560
are touched on the XL, I also did my sort of annual play through of half life and half

26:07.560 --> 26:12.040
life to episodes one and two. I beat those from start to finish. This is, that's kind

26:12.040 --> 26:17.880
of like your version of dark soccer is Christmas nights. I notice once or twice a year I just

26:17.880 --> 26:22.880
get half life fever and I got to play through it. I just need to do half life to like that.

26:22.880 --> 26:26.880
The proper half life too. I haven't done that yet. And some chatters and a chat might be

26:26.880 --> 26:30.000
thinking about a story that happened in gaming news this week. And yes, we'll be talking

26:30.000 --> 26:35.840
about that later. So bastions five bucks. That's a good game. Very good game. Lot of

26:35.840 --> 26:38.420
a game of the year list. Speaking of game of the year list, I do want to get this out

26:38.420 --> 26:42.740
at some point. Um, I know it's 2012 but since we didn't have a show last week and the way

26:42.740 --> 26:46.600
timing worked out, we need to have a proper like end of the year kind of recap. So we

26:46.600 --> 26:50.200
will be talking about our games of the year. Dark soccer myself and Alan have picked our

26:50.200 --> 26:53.520
top three games of the year. We'll get Loki's next week guys. Don't worry when he's back.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.000
Uh, but we want to hear your guys's game of the year picks too. So we have some posts

26:57.000 --> 27:01.880
on Facebook and Google plus. So if you haven't chimed in yet, go do that. Cause we're going

27:01.880 --> 27:07.160
to do that in part B and some of our picks might surprise you. So I know that there are

27:07.160 --> 27:11.720
probably what, three games that everybody's picking. Well, we'll see. Maybe our lists

27:11.720 --> 27:14.720
are the same three, maybe not, but I want to emphasize there's no right or wrong answers.

27:14.720 --> 27:19.400
And I got to say, just looking at Facebook and Google plus, I'm really impressed at the

27:19.400 --> 27:24.520
diversity of choices. I really truly don't think that just because every media outlet

27:24.520 --> 27:29.040
says game A, B or C is the game of the year means everybody else is on board. Like I don't

27:29.040 --> 27:34.000
think any two people have picked the same game. Very interesting. So anyway, sorry about

27:34.000 --> 27:39.160
that. Uh, where were we? Your gaming week, Alan? I really think that that's it. I, uh,

27:39.160 --> 27:44.360
as far as this week, I've scrambled around on the steam contest for the holiday sale

27:44.360 --> 27:52.240
where you unlock Steve achievements to earn coupons. Um, also I have two coupons for 50

27:52.240 --> 27:56.320
percent off any valve game. Good through, I think the first of March if an all our listener

27:56.320 --> 28:00.520
wants to add me on steam, I'll trade them that coupon. We should have an OLR group on

28:00.520 --> 28:05.280
steam that they could find you on. So I played psycho knots for about an hour and a half

28:05.280 --> 28:12.000
to be able to use my mind power that, um, pyromania to burn two squirrels because there

28:12.000 --> 28:17.040
was an achievement for cooking two critters. So I played some games like super meat boy

28:17.040 --> 28:21.960
has one yesterday that I need to go through. So that's all I know you're doing that too.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.140
So if you want to find us on steam or any of that stuff, um, this, it's awesome on orange

28:25.140 --> 28:29.240
launch radio.com and the upper right hand corner is this little box that says extended

28:29.240 --> 28:33.480
play and you'll see all the logos for like all the community social networking websites

28:33.480 --> 28:37.960
and you'll see the steam logo on there and you can join the OLR clan and you can say

28:37.960 --> 28:44.240
hi to Alan or salacious pop and he'll give you treats. It sounds like maybe, maybe he

28:44.240 --> 28:49.600
may not have enough for everybody. Um, my gaming week, um, I've played a lot of hodgepodge

28:49.600 --> 28:53.440
kind of stuff. Like I mentioned before, I bought seeing star queen clue, but there's

28:53.440 --> 28:58.200
probably two games primarily I've been playing. Um, you know, kind of focusing on the past

28:58.200 --> 29:03.360
couple of weeks. Uh, first one I'll mention is on the three DS, um, a port of one of my

29:03.360 --> 29:07.560
favorite games that I played for the first time last year, even though the game is actually

29:07.560 --> 29:13.000
a couple of years old itself. Uh, VVVVVV came out for the three DS it's on the three

29:13.000 --> 29:18.360
DS shop. I mean literally like just last week. Uh, and you know, it's, it's a very faithful

29:18.360 --> 29:23.660
port of the version that's on the PC. You don't have the level editor, although they're

29:23.660 --> 29:29.000
saying that that may be coming in the future, but you do have some like best of user created

29:29.000 --> 29:33.680
levels, which is pretty cool. And of course the games in three D a little bit. I mean,

29:33.680 --> 29:38.260
it's not complicated three D it's kind of like the NES classics. It's like, like three

29:38.260 --> 29:45.260
different layers of three D kind of see things on. Um, but the game itself, VVVVV is a great

29:45.260 --> 29:50.120
game and excellent game. Some folks may find it to be a little bit short, but I think it's

29:50.120 --> 29:55.560
well worth it for the $8 kick ass soundtrack. It's kind of very similar to super Metroid,

29:55.560 --> 29:59.840
very easy gimmick, uh, the whole gravity flipping thing, but it works so well. I mean, it's

29:59.840 --> 30:03.880
a, it's a great game. It's, it's great. And of course as somebody who loved Commodore

30:03.880 --> 30:08.960
64 and really grew up on Commodore 64, I love that the game has a lot of, you know, kind

30:08.960 --> 30:14.560
of tips of the hat to the Commodore 64 days, including the loading screen. So I thought,

30:14.560 --> 30:18.960
I think the three DS version is a worthy port. I realize some people may have a hard time

30:18.960 --> 30:25.200
justifying, well, I just bought VVVV as part of the humble indie bundle that was just out

30:25.200 --> 30:30.660
because it was one of the games from the third that came back and I paid five bucks for likes,

30:30.660 --> 30:36.620
you know, 15 games that included VVVV. Why would I go pay $7 in the three DS shop now?

30:36.620 --> 30:41.120
That's a damn good question. Maybe it's not worth it in that regard. But for me, I love

30:41.120 --> 30:44.480
the idea of having a portable version. You know, sometimes you just want games to be

30:44.480 --> 30:49.920
able to have wherever you are, airport, you know, commuting or whatever it is that you're

30:49.920 --> 30:55.640
doing, you know, out and about, it's sometimes nice to have some games to go and VVVV is

30:55.640 --> 31:01.440
a worthy addition to the three DS lineup. Um, let's see. Otherwise, the other game that

31:01.440 --> 31:09.440
I spent a huge chunk of time playing is Star Wars, the Old Republic, the new MMO, uh, that's

31:09.440 --> 31:16.560
out from BioWare and EA. I did pick this up, uh, the 21st, the day after it was out. And

31:16.560 --> 31:21.620
I've spent a good part of the past couple weeks playing it. I have like four characters

31:21.620 --> 31:26.440
in the level 10-ish range, two of them Imperial and two of them Empire. So I've gotten a good

31:26.440 --> 31:33.160
feel, especially for the introduction parts of the game. Um, this, God, where do I even

31:33.160 --> 31:38.840
begin with this? A lot of people are comparing it to WoW. And I got to say this comment first.

31:38.840 --> 31:43.800
I, I'm really amazed with how pressed some of the Star Wars players are when it comes

31:43.800 --> 31:49.640
to WoW because the general chat half the time is nothing but talk about, oh, this game is

31:49.640 --> 31:54.200
so much better than WoW. And, oh, this game, oh, this game just kicks WoW's ass. And, oh,

31:54.200 --> 31:57.680
WoW is a kiddie game. And you know, they're just bringing pandas cause it's a kiddie game.

31:57.680 --> 32:02.160
I used to play WoW, but it sucks now. And it's like, wow, you guys hate WoW so much.

32:02.160 --> 32:08.800
You can't stop talking about it. But that's not really a slam on Star Wars. That's just

32:08.800 --> 32:13.400
a slam on the chat community. I was comparing it to Star Trek Online. Let, well, here's

32:13.400 --> 32:20.080
my point. Let both games just be, because does Star Wars have a lot of inspiration from

32:20.080 --> 32:24.400
WoW? Sure. One of the classes I was playing, I was laughing cause I'm like, this place

32:24.400 --> 32:28.620
is just like a warrior. It even has a talent called Sunder and you build up rage. I'm like,

32:28.620 --> 32:35.540
this is like, just like a WoW warrior. But at the same time, the questing in Star Wars,

32:35.540 --> 32:40.860
The Old Republic, is so immersive. Like, you know, the voice acting really adds a neat

32:40.860 --> 32:46.200
element to it. Of course, the whole Bioware touch of the conversation trees, the fact

32:46.200 --> 32:51.680
that you can have your character be light side or dark side, even within the Empire

32:51.680 --> 32:56.480
or Imperial. Like, you can be a bad Jedi or you can be a good Sith. It's really funky

32:56.480 --> 33:00.840
how that works, but I like that. And the group conversation is really interesting too. I've

33:00.840 --> 33:07.080
been playing the game a lot with Shane. And, like, we will both kind of go out and quest

33:07.080 --> 33:11.960
together and he likes to have his person be good and I like to have mine be bad. So, it's

33:11.960 --> 33:15.360
kind of funny watching that struggle and you get to see kind of different outcomes and

33:15.360 --> 33:21.000
all that. So, it's neat. I wanted to finish my thought really, really quick though on

33:21.000 --> 33:27.080
the whole, like, pressed Star Wars people and WoW. WoW obviously got its inspiration

33:27.080 --> 33:30.960
from other games too and that's important to say. Like, I think Star Wars is just this

33:30.960 --> 33:36.520
company's evolution of the MMO genre. And the question is, does it work? And my answer

33:36.520 --> 33:43.840
is, in most places yes, but in a few places no. And I think any MMO is going to have this

33:43.840 --> 33:48.000
problem when it first comes out and that's kind of about finding the balance. And I think

33:48.000 --> 33:51.520
that's where the game has its trickiest part right now is balance and a lot of that has

33:51.520 --> 33:58.300
to do with the economy. The economy is really clouded, uncertain right now and it's really

33:58.300 --> 34:02.920
hard to make money and they just nerfed one of the big professions for that and so a lot

34:02.920 --> 34:07.400
of that needs some fine tuning. But, you know, the game's only been out two weeks. For an

34:07.400 --> 34:11.800
MMO that's hardly anything, I'm sure a lot of that will be fixed in time. But the other

34:11.800 --> 34:15.440
thing I've got to knock Star Wars for because this is something I keep saying, like, every

34:15.440 --> 34:20.480
time I'm playing the game, damn, I wish they would fix this. One of the reasons I love

34:20.480 --> 34:26.040
WoW is the community and the UIs that they've built and Star Wars desperately needs to open

34:26.040 --> 34:31.120
it up and let users make their own UIs and interfaces and add-ons, especially for things

34:31.120 --> 34:35.600
like the auction house, especially for things like targeting and things of that sort. Because

34:35.600 --> 34:40.860
if you have two people and their companions out, healing is kind of a pain in the butt.

34:40.860 --> 34:46.560
So I'd like to see some UI changes for that and just some of the ways things are set up

34:46.560 --> 34:52.000
are a little weird and I just think the community could improve on that a little bit. But, it's,

34:52.000 --> 34:59.320
I mean, especially compared to, I played Riff when it first came out. I played Warhammer

34:59.320 --> 35:02.600
when it first came out. I played, you know, I've played a lot of the Ion. I played Ion

35:02.600 --> 35:06.320
when it first came out. I played a lot of the other ones. And this is really the first

35:06.320 --> 35:12.660
one where I was like, wow, this really is something different. This is a neat experience.

35:12.660 --> 35:17.720
This, you know, I like the story, which is weird because I'm not even that big on the

35:17.720 --> 35:23.320
Star Wars movies. Like, you know, I appreciate them. I understand why there's fandom for

35:23.320 --> 35:28.240
the old movies from the 70s at least, not the new ones. But, you know, I get, you know,

35:28.240 --> 35:31.520
I get why Star Wars is popular, but I found myself really getting kind of sucked into

35:31.520 --> 35:36.000
the story and it's really interesting. And I really liked getting to kind of, you know,

35:36.000 --> 35:42.160
play this character that could be light or dark or neutral or what have you. So the biggest

35:42.160 --> 35:48.960
strengths are in the fact that every single player game element is great. And you could

35:48.960 --> 35:53.840
go from 0 to 50 single player, no problem. I think it really helps when MMOs have the

35:53.840 --> 35:59.080
mythology pre-built to then bring in. Because Lord of the Rings Online, obviously, Lord

35:59.080 --> 36:06.740
of the Rings is, you know, significantly huge. You know, it's been around for 50, 60 years.

36:06.740 --> 36:10.440
Star Wars Galaxies, I guess, was a bad game, but that also had the Star Wars mythos to

36:10.440 --> 36:17.600
bring with it. Well, hold on. World of Warcraft had WoW or Warcraft Orcs vs. Humans 1, 2,

36:17.600 --> 36:22.280
and 3 and Blizzard put in a shitload of lore. I was going to say quickly, Star Wars Galaxies

36:22.280 --> 36:27.540
wasn't necessarily a bad game. It was a game that made bad decisions. Well, yeah, because

36:27.540 --> 36:32.600
they, yeah, they switched it up to make more, make it more accessible in all the diehard

36:32.600 --> 36:36.880
people. Right. Don't alienate your primary fan base. It's something, it's where, that's

36:36.880 --> 36:44.300
where WoW is that a, because for some people, Cataclysm was the equivalent of the NXC. And,

36:44.300 --> 36:47.360
you know, so anyway, or New User, what did they call it? New User Experience, whatever

36:47.360 --> 36:52.920
it was called. Anyway. But because Bioware doesn't as of yet have a good MMO pedigree,

36:52.920 --> 36:57.240
they do have a great game pedigree. I mean, it's Bioware, so I didn't really have any

36:57.240 --> 37:04.440
doubt in my mind that the Old Republic was going to be bad as just a campaign experience.

37:04.440 --> 37:08.480
But a lot of people are wondering when, once you get to level 50, are there, I mean, are

37:08.480 --> 37:13.320
there raids? Like what do you do once you're at max level? Apparently there are, there

37:13.320 --> 37:16.840
are operations, I think they're called, which are the equivalent of raids, I believe. And

37:16.840 --> 37:21.020
there's PVP. You can do PVP at level 10 and all that. But that's a good question. I'm

37:21.020 --> 37:24.440
not really sure. I'm sitting here as somebody who's been playing the game for two weeks

37:24.440 --> 37:30.480
and I'm not really sure. Because with Rift, Rift was a completely new property. They had

37:30.480 --> 37:33.920
to do all that world building about the conflict and there's this race and this race and blah,

37:33.920 --> 37:39.200
blah, blah and why these big portals are opening up in the sky. All the time. All the time,

37:39.200 --> 37:44.360
which is a different problem altogether. And it was just hard to really invest myself in

37:44.360 --> 37:50.720
the world that I was playing in. Whereas with Star Wars and WoW, you have the mythology

37:50.720 --> 37:54.960
going back years and years that players already will play that. That's what brings people

37:54.960 --> 38:00.220
to those games, I think. So to try to kind of try and wrap up, because I know I'm rambling

38:00.220 --> 38:04.220
here a bit, but to kind of wrap up my thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic, I think it's

38:04.220 --> 38:08.280
a good game. And if you're into MMOs, you'll probably want to pounce on this pretty quick

38:08.280 --> 38:13.640
because, you know, a lot of people have been. But if you're not sure, I say wait. Because

38:13.640 --> 38:16.840
I think the game's only going to get better with a little more maturity and age. And I

38:16.840 --> 38:22.240
think in six months to a year when they really have a lot of players in end game and they

38:22.240 --> 38:27.320
have a lot of this ironed out, I think the game's going to be very, very neat. Is it

38:27.320 --> 38:31.560
a WoW killer? I don't know. I don't really like that term. Because I don't think, like

38:31.560 --> 38:36.200
there's similar games out there all the time. You know, Burnout didn't kill Need for Speed

38:36.200 --> 38:41.840
and you know, Call of Duty and Battlefield can compete. You know, it's just different.

38:41.840 --> 38:48.480
And it's expensive if you want to play both games. That's the only bummer. But the games

38:48.480 --> 38:52.000
can coexist. I don't think one necessarily has to cannibalize the other. I think there's

38:52.000 --> 38:55.240
going to always be people that want to play WoW. And there's going to be people that don't

38:55.240 --> 38:58.480
want to play WoW that want to play Star Wars. And you know, there's going to be people like

38:58.480 --> 39:04.520
me that kind of want to play a little bit of both. So, there you go. Alan, I do want

39:04.520 --> 39:07.820
to quickly ask you though, because you play a lot of MMOs. You've come on the other show

39:07.820 --> 39:12.180
Horde House a lot to talk about WoW. You play a lot of WoW. You raid in WoW. You're an end

39:12.180 --> 39:16.480
game raider. You're one of the tops of the server. But you don't seem to have that same

39:16.480 --> 39:23.080
interest in Star Wars. Is that because of your investment in WoW? Is it a money thing?

39:23.080 --> 39:29.880
Is it just being a hater? What is it? Well, I've dedicated myself to raiding with people

39:29.880 --> 39:38.080
12 hours a week, which is a lot. And I am comfortable with that arrangement for right

39:38.080 --> 39:43.760
now. Once I get a job, I will probably have to quit doing that. But it's a financial thing.

39:43.760 --> 39:51.280
I've already staked my claim with my raiding guild in WoW. And yeah, I don't want to pay

39:51.280 --> 40:01.120
15 bucks a month twice for that. I'm also on the year-long Diablo III Death Pact. So,

40:01.120 --> 40:05.400
I've pretty much said, yes WoW, regardless of how bad you get or how lame your patches

40:05.400 --> 40:10.000
are, I'm going to be sticking with you for a year. And I'm committed to that. I don't

40:10.000 --> 40:16.480
really need Wandering Eyes for MMOs. Though I will say though, the reason why I decided

40:16.480 --> 40:24.040
to start playing Dragon Age Origins until I beat it was the fact that aside from raiding,

40:24.040 --> 40:30.140
I am kind of burned out on WoW. So that's helping my console gaming more. I've actually

40:30.140 --> 40:34.440
been more into WoW than I have been in a WoW, which is really weird. I don't know if that's

40:34.440 --> 40:38.260
just because I've had a lot of time off work, so I've had more time to play things. Or the

40:38.260 --> 40:44.120
fact that I am loving Arcane Mage right now in Warcraft. But yeah, I'll play WoW for a

40:44.120 --> 40:48.420
couple hours. I'll play Star Wars for a couple hours. Then I go back to playing WoW. That's

40:48.420 --> 40:53.480
been a lot of my vacation when I'm not doing other more productive things. A lot of chatters

40:53.480 --> 40:58.000
talking about Guild Wars 2. Kaijuto, I think, kicked it off. I cannot wait for Guild Wars

40:58.000 --> 41:03.640
2. That's going to be my main MMO. And yeah, I gotta say, I'm really interested in Guild

41:03.640 --> 41:08.980
Wars 2 as well. I'm hoping the payment model is the same as Guild Wars 1 where it's buy

41:08.980 --> 41:15.000
the game and never pay money again. Would be great. Not have to pay a monthly fee or

41:15.000 --> 41:22.880
whatever. Yeah, I'm looking forward to Guild Wars 2. That'll be another MMO I'm going to

41:22.880 --> 41:29.400
have to somehow juggle. So we'll see. I kind of think in the long run, I may keep... It's

41:29.400 --> 41:33.040
hard to say. I've been off work this whole time, so I've been able to juggle two MMOs.

41:33.040 --> 41:37.880
But when I go back to work, I'm probably going to have to pick one or the other. And I've

41:37.880 --> 41:42.080
agreed to play WoW for a year. I'm on the same thing where I've already signed the death

41:42.080 --> 41:46.440
pact. I want to be, but I'm not. But I think even if I had to choose between the two, I

41:46.440 --> 41:50.840
would choose WoW at this point. Because I think Star Wars will get better with age.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.720
I didn't start... Think about it. I didn't start playing WoW until Burning Crusade expansion

41:54.720 --> 42:00.800
came out. I started WoW with vanilla. And hated it. And hated it. And then I played

42:00.800 --> 42:05.920
Burning Crusade and hated it. And then I didn't even bother with any of the other stuff because

42:05.920 --> 42:10.900
I still hated it. And then Cataclysm came out and I was like, I kind of like this.

42:10.900 --> 42:16.620
So does me saying, I don't want to maybe play Star Wars right now a bad thing? Not necessarily.

42:16.620 --> 42:21.000
I mean, God, look at my WoW addiction. And that just took a couple years to grow. So

42:21.000 --> 42:25.900
I think, I think, I think Star Wars will still be here in a year or two, unlike some of these

42:25.900 --> 42:29.920
other MMOs that have come out. Like, is anyone still playing Age of Conan? Anybody?

42:29.920 --> 42:33.560
It's not on the show role because I think it would have been for last week, but we didn't

42:33.560 --> 42:41.360
do a Christmas show. Didn't Swotar or the Old Republic hit a million paid subscribers

42:41.360 --> 42:45.840
the fastest out of even faster than WoW? Wasn't that a story? We're not covering it tonight,

42:45.840 --> 42:48.080
but they put out a press release saying that they have a million.

42:48.080 --> 42:53.000
I think they've sold like 1.5 million copies of the game globally. So that wouldn't surprise

42:53.000 --> 42:54.200
me at all. They have that many.

42:54.200 --> 42:58.080
Yeah. There's still two more, one or two more weeks before people start getting rebills.

42:58.080 --> 43:01.640
So the rebuilds is when they're going to be able to say that they have subscribers.

43:01.640 --> 43:02.640
Exactly.

43:02.640 --> 43:08.200
So we'll see. We'll see. All right. Um, there is stuff going on besides MMOs in the world.

43:08.200 --> 43:11.600
Quickly, some housekeeping and then we'll get into some news. Uh, I already mentioned

43:11.600 --> 43:14.580
the game of the year. We're going to talk about in part B, so stay tuned. Get your picks

43:14.580 --> 43:18.400
in at our Facebook or at our Google Plus page. And if you don't have us added on either of

43:18.400 --> 43:23.440
those pages, maybe you should take care of that. Um, also I want to plug some other things

43:23.440 --> 43:27.920
going on elsewhere. One of them that I really, really need to plug and make sure you guys

43:27.920 --> 43:33.080
know about is something called the big battle. And this is something that Derek from dead

43:33.080 --> 43:36.720
pixel live, which is another show on the all games network is kind of spearheading, but

43:36.720 --> 43:42.120
it's a lot of, uh, community shows kind of all pitching in to try and make this thing

43:42.120 --> 43:47.160
a success and get more people at the table wanting to kick each other's ass in a good

43:47.160 --> 43:50.880
way though, because it's all about fighting games. Uh, the big battle this time is I think

43:50.880 --> 43:56.640
the big beat down. Uh, and it's all fighting games. It's mortal combat, it's street fighter,

43:56.640 --> 44:01.480
arcade edition, it's street fighter three, it's ultimate mortal combat three. It's all

44:01.480 --> 44:07.200
these fighting games. Um, and we're trying to get as many people in to participate in

44:07.200 --> 44:13.660
the tournament to find out which show has the best fighting game fans. Um, so far I'm

44:13.660 --> 44:17.680
the only one signed up from OLR. So I'm hoping some of you will head on over to the big battle

44:17.680 --> 44:22.040
dot net and change that sign up over there on the beat down board, uh, for one of the

44:22.040 --> 44:25.120
games. Now the only kind of for some people deal breaker for some people is that it's

44:25.120 --> 44:29.840
all xbox 360. So some of you have these on PS3. See, I have mortal combat and super street

44:29.840 --> 44:36.200
fighter four on our PS3, so I couldn't sign up for those games. But yes, you can. What

44:36.200 --> 44:40.280
do you mean you can come to my house? I guess I could, huh? Yes, you can. What does that

44:40.280 --> 44:45.600
mean you're going to sign up to? Maybe I will. Ooh. Ooh. Well, there you go. Keep in mind,

44:45.600 --> 44:50.440
this is gimpy hand lady. You know, if you have an arcade stick that you could use, right?

44:50.440 --> 44:57.280
We have several arcade sticks. That won't be a problem. All right, so maybe, maybe we'll

44:57.280 --> 45:01.640
work something out. But anyway, it's all an xbox 360. So super street fighter for arcade

45:01.640 --> 45:05.780
edition, mortal combat, street fighter three, third strike online, ultimate mortal combat

45:05.780 --> 45:10.840
three. Go sign up on the beat down board at the big battle dot net and say you're going

45:10.840 --> 45:15.200
to represent the OL army or team OLR. Uh, they'll know what you're talking about. Go

45:15.200 --> 45:19.320
sign up and uh, I'll kick your ass soon if you're playing ultimate mortal combat three

45:19.320 --> 45:22.540
because that's the one of the games that I do own on the xbox 360, which I find funny

45:22.540 --> 45:25.520
because you can't buy that game anymore. Yet that's the game that has the most signups

45:25.520 --> 45:32.440
right now. I think people just love the classics. What else can you say? So go sign up. All

45:32.440 --> 45:38.440
right. Um, other thing I got to plug here, the geek dash life awards. Um, you know, we've

45:38.440 --> 45:41.640
talked about this website before and part of it is because you know, dark soccer is

45:41.640 --> 45:46.700
like a rights for it. You still write for it? Yes, I do. It's just with the last semester

45:46.700 --> 45:52.600
I slacked off on my writing. You know how busy I was. Well, the editors over there,

45:52.600 --> 45:56.480
which I don't believe was stark Sakura cause I think there's gotta be rules against that.

45:56.480 --> 46:00.440
But uh, the editors over there did nominate us as one of the best podcasts of the years

46:00.440 --> 46:05.760
and the second annual geek life awards. Woo hoo. Um, but the funny thing is, um, another

46:05.760 --> 46:10.360
podcast that was nominated was hoard house, my show about Warcraft right now in the poll

46:10.360 --> 46:14.480
hoard house is beating orange launch radio for best podcast of the year. I'm sure extra

46:14.480 --> 46:19.880
prayer had nothing to do at all with that, but if you want to go vote for hoard house

46:19.880 --> 46:23.600
or you want to go vote for orange lounge radio, I'm going to post that website in chat right

46:23.600 --> 46:27.140
now and you should go vote. Um, of course there are some other good shows nominated.

46:27.140 --> 46:30.720
I'm not going to dog the competition. Maybe you want to go vote for cheap ass gamer, fear

46:30.720 --> 46:35.160
the boot or battleship pretension, which are also nominated and find shows in their own

46:35.160 --> 46:38.760
right. So you know what, if you really think they are the best show of the year, then go

46:38.760 --> 46:42.880
vote for them. That's fine. Um, geek dash life. We just want to thank them. It's an

46:42.880 --> 46:47.680
honor to be nominated, right? Dark Sakura. God, what are you going to do if you lose

46:47.680 --> 46:56.480
to ex defer? I don't know. I guess talk about his bleached asshole. All right. Good answer.

46:56.480 --> 47:00.140
All right. Speaking of hoard house, I should mention we haven't done a show for like two

47:00.140 --> 47:07.800
weeks over there. Correlation bleacher asshole win an award. Do you want to find out? No.

47:07.800 --> 47:13.800
Okay. Anyway, um, uh, I should say a hoard house hasn't had a show for like two weeks

47:13.800 --> 47:17.800
and probably won't be back till next week. And that's just a timing thing on X for a

47:17.800 --> 47:22.960
nice part. Like I'm going to be gone for four days next week. So yep. Good times. Busy,

47:22.960 --> 47:26.120
busy, but Hey, it's the holidays so we can kind of get away with it. All right. Let's

47:26.120 --> 47:29.680
talk about gaming news. Let's get back into what is going on in the gaming industry this

47:29.680 --> 47:34.440
week. Not a lot come to find out, but there are some things going on. We do want to bring

47:34.440 --> 47:37.920
to the table and talk about with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

47:37.920 --> 47:44.020
Alan, start us off tonight. So Nintendo, they've been razzed on so hard, especially by the

47:44.020 --> 47:49.880
gentlemen that I am subbing for tonight. Um, as far as their inability to embrace stuff

47:49.880 --> 47:56.280
that other consoles are doing, particularly online supply, uh, online play, but they are

47:56.280 --> 48:02.680
jumping on one bandwagon finally, and that is paid DLC. Um, is it true that the Wii didn't,

48:02.680 --> 48:07.160
you couldn't patch games on the Wii, right? There were no, you cannot patch games on the

48:07.160 --> 48:12.200
Wii. Um, and the proof of this would be what's going on with Skyward Sword. They actually

48:12.200 --> 48:16.400
had to release this whole channel and it's there in the Wii shop. If you go look, one

48:16.400 --> 48:19.880
of the games I forgot to mention, I played this week, I found I had extra points in my

48:19.880 --> 48:24.200
Wii balance or Wii accounts. I went and bought blaster master for the NES on virtual console.

48:24.200 --> 48:29.120
Woo. But as I was looking for the shop, I saw the fix your game file channel for Skyward

48:29.120 --> 48:32.760
Sword and I was like, that has to be embarrassing. But yeah, they can't, they can't just patch

48:32.760 --> 48:37.400
Skyward Sword to do it. They have to have a fix my game channel. So even with their

48:37.400 --> 48:43.440
most, uh, up until the 3DS, they supplemental content, whether it be, um, to enhance the

48:43.440 --> 48:48.200
product or to correct the product, they just never did it. Well, um, Nintendo with the

48:48.200 --> 48:53.360
3DS are finally doing paid DLC and the first title that is going to get it is their new,

48:53.360 --> 48:58.600
uh, Fire Emblem franchise. I know Fire Emblem has had some characters in Smash Brothers

48:58.600 --> 49:03.600
for a while. It's not really that big of a franchise here, but I know a lot of the diehard

49:03.600 --> 49:08.960
Nintendo fans know about Fire Emblem and it's going to cost several hundred yen. It's kind

49:08.960 --> 49:13.440
of vague right now when it comes out. But yeah, you can expect, uh, you know, with the,

49:13.440 --> 49:18.000
uh, online store that 3DS has where you can buy the old, you know, Game Boy Advance and,

49:18.000 --> 49:26.440
um, the little, uh, the DSware games. Now when you buy a actual retail cart product,

49:26.440 --> 49:32.760
you can eventually log in maybe either through the game or through your 3DS and buy bonus

49:32.760 --> 49:37.640
campaigns for it, which is just money, money, money. I mean, look at Microsoft and Sony

49:37.640 --> 49:43.300
and all the millions they've made with pay to unlock launch day DLC that's on the disc.

49:43.300 --> 49:49.120
I should say this though. The Wii does have, the Wii does have kind of download content.

49:49.120 --> 49:55.600
Um, like Rockband has it. One of the games, Final Fantasy IV, the after years, you could

49:55.600 --> 50:00.240
download the extra chapters for a couple hundred Wii points each. So, I mean, Nintendo's done

50:00.240 --> 50:08.240
DLC a little bit, but not a lot of bit. And I want to say everything that was DLC on the

50:08.240 --> 50:12.360
Wii, I'm thinking, Chatter might correct me on this, but I want to say none of it was

50:12.360 --> 50:16.120
Nintendo themselves. All of it was third party companies that were doing it because, you

50:16.120 --> 50:21.320
know, Final Fantasy Square Enix, uh, Rockband is, you know, harmonics. So I don't think

50:21.320 --> 50:25.000
any of it is coming from Nintendo themselves. So that's what makes us notable both that

50:25.000 --> 50:30.720
A, it's the 3DS, which, you know, we haven't seen DLC on the 3DS yet. We've seen, you know,

50:30.720 --> 50:37.240
buy the game, right? I just pimped VVVV, uh, but we haven't seen DLC and it's Nintendo

50:37.240 --> 50:42.920
themselves now. That's a big deal. Yeah. So, so I stand corrected. Yeah. We did have the

50:42.920 --> 50:49.800
facilities for DLC, but this one, um, you know, for a handheld definitely is interesting.

50:49.800 --> 50:55.000
And the Wii U, they've also confirmed that it's going to have paid DLC, but there's still

50:55.000 --> 50:59.120
a lot more we need to find out about the Wii U than just that. Um, some comments from our

50:59.120 --> 51:03.660
chat room at chat.orangewonstrategy.com. Yuki says, and here I was respecting Nintendo for

51:03.660 --> 51:10.280
not doing DLC till now. Tigerclaws theorizing, who knows, maybe a new Zelda quest via DLC.

51:10.280 --> 51:17.160
Kaijuto just says, yeah, the DLC sounds lame. So maybe this begs the question, is this good

51:17.160 --> 51:25.120
news or is this bad news? I think it's really all about in what is it that they're offering?

51:25.120 --> 51:29.240
I mean, none of us here on the show, and I think in chat really appreciate that pay to

51:29.240 --> 51:33.880
unlock content that feels like a slap in the face, you know, the, uh, content that's already

51:33.880 --> 51:38.720
on the disc that you have to pay money to get like the, you know, the Katamari levels

51:38.720 --> 51:42.080
were there. Some fighting games have characters that are already on the disc. You have to

51:42.080 --> 51:48.160
pay to unlock and so on. But when you are truly downloading expansions that enhance

51:48.160 --> 51:54.960
like, you know, what Dragon Age Awakenings in some ways. The Fable ones. Like extra quote.

51:54.960 --> 51:59.400
Well, yes and no. Like some of the DLC I don't think is very good with Fable. But I'm saying

51:59.400 --> 52:07.280
I'm using it as a type. Sure. Sure. Well, Awakenings is closer to the, to the model

52:07.280 --> 52:12.120
that PC games used in the 80s and 90s and that it was a proper expansion that was a

52:12.120 --> 52:17.680
good 20 or 30 hours of game, which is about how long I spent on it. With Dragon Age Origins

52:17.680 --> 52:23.440
before I played Awakenings, I did go onto the BioWare store and buy some of their DLC.

52:23.440 --> 52:27.120
And those were only like two or three hours long for five bucks, but I was still, it was

52:27.120 --> 52:32.440
well done. So they're not all terrible. Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, my brother was commenting

52:32.440 --> 52:36.000
to me about Nintendo not doing DLC. He said Nintendo should have made new tracks for Mario

52:36.000 --> 52:40.280
Kart. And yeah, I'm kind of like, I would like to see Mario Kart seven, get more tracks,

52:40.280 --> 52:44.360
download content, you know, as long as they don't go down that path that, you know, we

52:44.360 --> 52:47.640
talked about Ridge Racer on the Vita a couple of weeks ago on the show, like it sounds like

52:47.640 --> 52:53.760
they're doing a horrible thing, but like every Mario Kart game ever has had 32 tracks except

52:53.760 --> 52:59.680
I think the Game Boy one, you could unlock all of the tracks in the original in, which

52:59.680 --> 53:02.560
was a hell of a deal. You know what I mean? But most Mario, you know, you buy a Mario

53:02.560 --> 53:06.720
Kart game, you know, you're going to get eight cups, four of them retro, four of them new

53:06.720 --> 53:10.560
for, you know, it's, it's like the same formula every time, but I think it'd be pretty rad

53:10.560 --> 53:15.080
if some more of the retro levels came back as DLC, you know, I would, I would support

53:15.080 --> 53:20.160
that as long as it was reasonably priced, you know, there's gotta be a limit to it,

53:20.160 --> 53:24.660
but it would be interesting. But I think there's a lot of ways that Nintendo could do this

53:24.660 --> 53:31.160
very wrong too. And of course pay to unlock content is the wrong way to do it or stuff

53:31.160 --> 53:36.560
that doesn't enhance stuff that's required for the core gaming experience would be bad.

53:36.560 --> 53:43.000
Well, going down the same path, I got a story here about what's happening at the Wii U.

53:43.000 --> 53:48.200
The Wii U obviously not going to be out for a while, but some rumors out there that Nintendo

53:48.200 --> 53:52.960
is going to be doing a full blown app store for the system. So think like, you know, what

53:52.960 --> 53:57.640
iTunes has going on. Right now, you know, they've got the eShop, they've got little

53:57.640 --> 54:02.480
stores, but the Wii U supposedly is going to go one step further. There's going to be

54:02.480 --> 54:10.200
a wide variety of apps. It will be stuff that will operate on the Wii U itself like TV things

54:10.200 --> 54:15.080
like you see on Xbox 360, Major League Baseball, but some things that will run independently

54:15.080 --> 54:19.560
on the controller because the tablet obviously is its own little screen or what have you.

54:19.560 --> 54:24.000
Now the only thing that confuses me about that is I thought that controller doesn't

54:24.000 --> 54:28.760
have its own processor in it. Like I thought all that did was stream video that's basically

54:28.760 --> 54:33.280
being processed by your Wii U. It was just like a terminal, just like an output. Yeah,

54:33.280 --> 54:38.400
it's like that on live in your own house. Best way to describe it, you know, that's

54:38.400 --> 54:43.800
how it's working. So my thought is, well, are you really downloading apps to your controller

54:43.800 --> 54:47.080
then or are you downloading apps that just play on your controller but you can't really

54:47.080 --> 54:51.280
take them portable? Unless something drastic has changed with the specs of the system,

54:51.280 --> 54:55.520
maybe they are giving that thing a little processor, I don't know. I would think they're

54:55.520 --> 55:01.040
not because they want to keep the cost down, but it would be interesting if that's happening.

55:01.040 --> 55:05.480
But they are talking about, you know, check your email, browse the web, do Facebook and

55:05.480 --> 55:09.560
maybe some little games too on that little device. I could see where, you know, you have

55:09.560 --> 55:13.480
the controller in your bedroom and it's streaming from the device in the living room and you

55:13.480 --> 55:17.420
can kind of like surf the web from bed and all that, but I don't know, most people have

55:17.420 --> 55:23.440
iPhones, iPads, Kindles, you know, other devices for that. Yeah. So I don't know if we use

55:23.440 --> 55:31.640
necessary, but I don't know, what do you guys think? I can see the advantage, especially

55:31.640 --> 55:38.200
if you just want one thing to give you all the convenience. So maybe that's a good thing.

55:38.200 --> 55:44.800
And honestly, it makes me think of that, what's that laptop that my husband wants, the transformer

55:44.800 --> 55:50.900
where you pull off the top and as a tablet, I think it might be something to that extent.

55:50.900 --> 55:57.360
So like, say that you're, here's a, just a very domestic example, but you know, say that

55:57.360 --> 56:02.940
your Wii is your way of surfing the web, you know, and you like are looking for a cake

56:02.940 --> 56:07.440
recipe, put the cake recipe on your little tablet, take it to the kitchen and go make

56:07.440 --> 56:13.540
your cake. I mean, I'm just using that as an example. That would work. I could see that

56:13.540 --> 56:18.240
in a little Nintendo promo they do, you know, because there, there are marketing it to more

56:18.240 --> 56:25.920
of a home family type of thing. So that way you've got more uses out of it. Something

56:25.920 --> 56:32.560
that is on that family oriented domestic level. So I don't know why the chatters are doing

56:32.560 --> 56:36.600
this, but they're putting app in the names of all these Nintendo franchises like app

56:36.600 --> 56:43.760
zero, the app of Zelda app, Icarus excite app. But that, I mean, one of the ones that was suggested

56:43.760 --> 56:48.240
by GOV day was app crossing. And that made me think, Oh God, there's where DLC could

56:48.240 --> 56:53.520
go really wrong is animal crossing. Oh man. I mean, it could be really good, but I just

56:53.520 --> 56:57.880
see, Oh, I could just see the easy cash in on animal crossing. You know what though for

56:57.880 --> 57:05.040
Wii U imagine animal crossing with Wii U you can go to the island again. Maybe, who knows?

57:05.040 --> 57:08.880
I just would like to see them do something really different with animal crossing. You

57:08.880 --> 57:13.080
know, they've got the basics. We've seen the same game four times now. I'll be nice to

57:13.080 --> 57:20.400
see something different. Tom Nook is a real estate agent. Great. Tom Nook can foreclose

57:20.400 --> 57:28.600
on me. Can't wait. All right. Anyhow, he is the 1%. All right. Dark soccer. What do you

57:28.600 --> 57:34.600
have for us news wise? I have a little something actually it's a cease and desist that my

57:34.600 --> 57:42.040
apologies. It's that's later story. It's cease and desist that story right now. Yes, I will.

57:42.040 --> 57:48.880
All right. It's the UK prices. Well, actually the European union prices for the Vita and

57:48.880 --> 57:55.280
the memory cards and stuff. So, um, here's some of the game prices. Um, uncharted golden

57:55.280 --> 58:07.320
abyss will be 49.99 euro or 44.99 pound. Bond nation racer will be 39.99 or 34.99 respectively.

58:07.320 --> 58:14.240
Everybody's golf the same wipeout 2048 the same unit 13 also the same little deviance

58:14.240 --> 58:20.440
will be 29.99 euro and 24.99 pound. And then, um, reality fighters is the same price as

58:20.440 --> 58:26.240
well. So as far as the, um, different bits that go with it, the four gig memory card

58:26.240 --> 58:33.680
will be 19.99, 17.99 pound. Um, eight gig will be 34.99 or 31.99 and the 16 gig will

58:33.680 --> 58:44.560
be 49.99 and 44.99. Uh, lots of other stuff too. Like the chargers 49.99 slash 44.99.

58:44.560 --> 58:49.320
All these different man, England. Why do you have to stick with the pounds? Why can't you

58:49.320 --> 58:53.440
know? I should probably kind of a decent thing that they did given where the euro started

58:53.440 --> 59:00.080
going. Anyway. Um, I'm actually trying to get the price of the system on here while

59:00.080 --> 59:03.600
that's loading. Why don't I just jump in here real quick in case you are wondering, you

59:03.600 --> 59:07.920
hadn't heard the, the u s American currencies. I did pull up Amazon real quick to just kind

59:07.920 --> 59:11.880
of most of what dark soccer said. If you just replace euro with dollars, it's pretty much

59:11.880 --> 59:17.080
the same thing. Uh, the wifi system itself, two 49 99 and dollars. The first edition bundles

59:17.080 --> 59:21.000
is going to be three 49 99. The games right now are all over the map. It just really depends

59:21.000 --> 59:26.840
on what the game is. Like uncharted 49 99 little big planet, 39 99. Uh, but like hot

59:26.840 --> 59:33.440
shots, golf, golf, golf. What is golf? Hot shots, golf. It's a cool game. Gore physical

59:33.440 --> 59:39.360
game. Hot shots, Gore. If I'd buy that hot shots golf though is 29 99 as is wipeout 2048.

59:39.360 --> 59:44.200
So I'm assuming maybe those games are a little, I don't know. It's hard to tell. Like touch

59:44.200 --> 59:49.160
my Katamari is also 29 99. Is that indicative of the quality? I don't know. I hope not.

59:49.160 --> 59:55.040
Well, we do have the list of, um, the, the u s release titles too. Not a, it's actually

59:55.040 --> 01:00:01.280
says the full list from the u s PlayStation blog. On launch day there will be escape plan.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:07.440
Um, hot shots, a golf world, invitational hustle Kings, little deviants, my nation racers,

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:14.000
road trip, super star dust, Delta, uncharted golden abyss, a wipeout 2048 and as far as

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.920
third party stuff goes, just to look this over and point out the stuff that isn't absolute

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.560
crap as far as I know. Um, blaze blue continuum shift extend. This is just a great name. Army

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:29.880
core of hell, luminous electronic symphony. Is that launch day or launch window says launch

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:41.120
day. Nice. Um, what else is on here? Uh, plants versus zombies, Rayman origins. Um, touch

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.400
of space, mutant blobs, touch my Katamari, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom versus, uh,

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:53.120
ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three. And as far as launch windows, um, does Gaia three

01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:00.060
Ridge racer, silent hell book of memories. So we're seeing some stuff. I think Ninja

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:08.320
guidance. Is that Sigma? Yeah, it's actually the Sigma symbol. I know my Greek. So yeah.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.000
All right. So, um, yeah, Vita, I know I'm going to probably have to pick one up now,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.720
especially that no luminous touch my Katamari. I will totally touch your Katamari. You want

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.920
to, I'll only touch yours if you touch mine. Okay. Uh, Alan, I know you're probably not

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.120
going to buy a Vita the day they come out cause you know, you'll play mine when I'm

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.480
at work, but what do you think? You're going to touch this Katamari when you touch my Katamari

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.400
while I'm at work. Yeah, probably. Are you excited about the release at all? Are you

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.360
just like, eh, whatever, another system, you know, I've heard Vita has had some mixed stuff

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.800
going on in Japan that there's been a lot of bumps in the road. I don't really have

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:50.440
the energy to like Stan or to be really fanatical about a system, but it took about a year.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.800
It took about two or three years, but the PSP I thought was a really good system, a

01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:02.280
really good handheld. And I really think that the PSP is underrated, dare I say it, because

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:08.880
the DS, which was phenomenal, sort of steamrolled it, which is a reality. But you know, I'm

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.040
looking forward to the PSP Vita because I thought the PSP itself was damn good, but

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:18.920
I just, you know, financially and with the time I have towards games, I can't really

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.620
get all that excited about a launch day purchase like I would have been 10 years ago. So maybe

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:29.360
for next Christmas though, once things get ironed out, the next Christmas, I'll want

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.920
a 3DS because if I'm doing things two years later, then I'll want, yeah.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.880
Good to know. Good to know. I can start planning ahead. All right. Well, let's move on with

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.540
some more news, Alan.

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:44.000
There was a recent interview with Kojima of Konami, the mastermind who wrote the Metal

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.680
Gear series and reminiscing about Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation 1 and how amazing

01:02:51.680 --> 01:03:01.120
it was. And just him looking back on the experience and he was basically answering speculation

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:07.920
about a possible Metal Gear Solid remake because they are doing the HD remake for the PS3 of

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:14.340
I believe it's Metal Gear Solid 2 and Snake Eater. But Metal Gear Solid, the original,

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:18.640
isn't a part of it. So people are like, well, obviously that was the most famous of the

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.920
3 because it was groundbreaking, you know, especially on the, it was probably one of

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:28.000
the best looking games during the entire PS1 life cycle. Does that mean that they're going

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.680
to be releasing one separately? And Kojima has just said, you know, that's ultimately

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:41.360
it's Konami's decision. If they want to do a remake of it, that's fine, but he won't

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.500
really like, he doesn't care enough. He thinks the game is perfect or is good at it as is.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.960
He didn't think any corners were cut that he would want to go back and rewrite parts.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.760
He thought that the story was complete the first time it was told. So they're welcome

01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:01.400
to do it, but Kojima is not really saying that he's psyched up about wanting to remake

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400
it.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.640
Would you, do you think it's worth them or worth it for them to put the time and effort

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.560
into remaking the first game? I mean, I kind of get why they're doing that because I think

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.360
they're probably taking the easy way out with the 2 and 3 remakes, you know, just quickly

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.360
up-rezzing.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.720
It's like what the God of War, which I know it was Sony and not Konami, but it's just,

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.400
they were already nice enough graphics that they could just upscale the textures.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.580
Right, which is probably what's happening with Silent Hill too. But this, you know,

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.760
going back and doing the first one would be, you know, they're not going to be able to

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.760
do that as easy.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.920
Didn't they kind of remake one already for the GameCube with Twin Snakes?

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920
Yes.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.600
That was, the script and the voice acting was changed a bit, but it was still ultimately

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.160
that game. The story was retold.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.880
And it was really great. I mean, I thought it was probably, of course, we have just about

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.280
every Metal Gear thing that comes out, so it was really great.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:57.460
Yeah, so with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes for the GameCube, that's kind of like if they

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:03.280
did an HD remake of Resident Evil when we have the Resident Evil remake on the GameCube.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.800
Again, totally different franchise, but it's the same thing. Like, we've already kind of

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:13.640
had that. So, you know, if, I mean, let's be real. If they remade Metal Gear Solid HD

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.680
as a separate release, people would buy it. So if Kami wants money, they should do it.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.520
But Kojima is just, you know, he's not.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.520
But a lot of people would rather they just put that effort into making a Metal Gear Solid

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.520
5.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.520
Yes.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520
Which, story-wise.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520
Which obviously you would want Kojima on board for that.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520
Right.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520
Because it'd be a new story.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:36.520
Right. So, all right. Well, moving on. It was brought up earlier in the show that Steam

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.120
is having a crazy sale right now. I wanted to just take some time to kind of talk about

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.560
a lot of the crap that's on sale.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.720
I did get Bastion.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.520
Did you? Were you able to buy it through the website?

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.520
Yeah.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:52.440
Nice. Well, Bastion is five bucks right now. Skyrim is 33% off. Batman Arkham City is 50%

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:56.500
off right now. That's crazy. There's lots of other games. And in fact, I even saw somebody

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.400
in chat earlier, I think it was Pod Culture said, damn it, I just spent 20 bucks on that

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.240
sale. Like, curse you, Evil Steam's Tales. Like today, or the first, is really kind of

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.880
the encore day.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.680
Magica is a good pick. That's $2.50. LA Noire Complete Editions, $12.50. I mean, that game

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:17.880
was just six months old. So it's interesting. A lot of this stuff that's on sale. What's

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.600
also interesting is the competition that they're doing. Well, it's a competition. What's the

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.720
right thing to call it? The achievements for loot, basically.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.720
Yeah.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.680
They have these set achievements and with them, you can win little coupons for games.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:38.360
Like I got a 75% off Left 4 Dead 2. Basically like, have the sale anytime you want type

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:44.720
of thing. Or you can get little pieces of coal. And the little pieces of coal can either

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:50.520
be contest entries into winning every game Steam has ever put out ever, is the grand

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.840
prize. Like you would never be able to play all that. Or I think you runner up prizes

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:59.320
are like all the games on your wish list and like every Valve game ever made and you know,

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.680
things like that. What's interesting, I was reading about this and something I want to

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:10.520
bring up. I just read about this today. I guess Steam ran out of the third party prizes.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:14.020
Like if you get seven pieces of coal, you're only going to be able to get Valve stuff with

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.640
that now. There's nothing third party you can get with that now.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.200
There was a game I'm blanking on what it was that was released on Steam. I think it happened

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:27.600
a year or two ago where they ran out of the license, like the codes, like the CD key code.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.040
You get one of those digitally. They didn't have, like they ran out so they couldn't sell

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.920
the game anymore because they didn't have the manufacturers. So it's probably the same

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.320
thing here. They gave away the little free.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:44.020
Or the agreement was they would take the loss up to X many copies. But a lot of people are

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:49.520
upset because there's been those accounts out there that have kind of been abusing this.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:54.920
We had a story a couple weeks ago about people were creating accounts just to trade the games

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:59.020
and get the coupons and trade, you know, kind of setting up all these sock accounts and

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:04.920
Valve had to do this. So a lot of people are kind of upset with the way this played out.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.520
And I'm kind of of two mindsets. I'm like, well, honestly, Valve does a lot more than

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:14.400
most people do when it comes to cheap games and that stuff. So I kind of like they don't

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.840
owe you anything. But at the same token, if I was really working towards something and

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.680
then found out, oh, they're out of it, like on the last day I got it, it would be frustrating.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:28.800
Certainly. You've been trying to save up coal. Were you going to cash it in now? Maybe not.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.880
I need two or three more and I have no idea what is even available. And now it sounds

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.440
like thanks to this story, there's even less available for me to look at. So I'm even less

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.440
motivated.

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.840
Is there anything Valve you don't own? Counter strike?

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:48.180
Counter strike and just stuff that I don't care about because it's multiplayer or whatever.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.660
One thing, though, about this whole sale and these achievements is that it really shows

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:58.760
how Valve works with the developers of these indie games, because especially with like

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:04.700
Toki Tori, whenever Valve has one of these sales on Steam, there will be several games

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:09.260
that will get updates where the developers have designed Christmas content specifically

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:16.820
for Steam, which is unprecedented. And Toki Tori had, it was basically the first world,

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.340
but it was all reskinned with snow and Christmas trees. So the developers went in and added

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:25.760
that for the sale. And Super Meat Boy, same thing. There's now a Christmas world for this

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.760
sale that you can go in and play.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:32.680
The one for Beat Hazard was mean. You have to play 10 minutes of Christmas music without

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:37.840
dying or without losing. And I did it twice and lost it nine minutes, 30 seconds. I was

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.840
so pissed.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.560
So you and the developers of Beat Hazard were like, all right, there's a Christmas sale.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.320
We're going to add Christmas music. Your Steam client will update the game automatically

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.660
for this sale. Like that's, I can't really think of any other example of when that's

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660
happened.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.420
Well, I love, well, the outside of Steam. Yeah. But I was going to say the Portal 2

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:01.620
release. Remember they had the whole unlock Portal 2 early thing on Steam and they had

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.920
special achievements and like audio surf. Like I remember one day I went to go play

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:10.220
audio surf and suddenly Portal 2 music just showed up like, and like I tried to play a

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:14.840
song and it was like, GLaDOS is taking over. And, and suddenly it was a Portal 2 song that

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:20.640
was really awesome. So I like when they kind of do stuff like that. So, yeah, you know,

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:25.180
but you know, I like this comment from Derek H in chat, especially if the thing they are

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.240
out of is digital and therefore not real.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.920
That's frustrating knowing that, Oh, you just ran out of something that's on the internet.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:39.420
Well, it needs a license, but yeah, no. So, um,

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:43.020
Advances themselves are more for inventory and marketing purposes.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.180
Well, my thought was that they just have an agreement with the developers. Like, Hey,

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:50.140
we're not going to give away unlimited amounts of 75% off your game. It's going to be limited

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:55.120
to 100,000 or something like that. You know? And I think for the sake of those third party

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.860
developers, many of them indie, I get it. And I cut them some slack.

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:03.620
Whatever they sell, they have to report back to the manufacturer because they have those

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.620
agreements.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:09.120
Sorry. I love Derek H's follow up comment. It's like running out of birthday wishes.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:16.960
I was going to wish you a happy birthday, but I used up my last one three days ago.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.020
When I woke up this morning, I had like five or six fucks to give, but now it's three o'clock

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:26.080
and I don't have a fuck anymore. You missed. I'm you're too late. If you caught me a noon,

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:31.860
I would have gave a fuck. But now I don't act deaf in chat says, uh, clarifies the abusing

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.280
of this, uh, sky.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.480
Many people cheated and had multiple accounts on steam to trade coals and stuff with themselves.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:44.040
So why do you need all these fake accounts? Get a significant other Alan and I traded

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.220
stuff.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.520
If I have any coal, you guys can have it. There's nothing left to get with it. Like

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.900
the only, this is why I don't even do this shit. No, seriously. I didn't sign up for

01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:01.320
any of it. I'd do it. Cause you know what? I have other stuff to do. Well, when I'm the

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.800
winner of every steam game ever, you can't play it.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:10.560
Well some of the achievements are have, have a wishlist or make, make sure that your wishlist

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.420
has at least 10 things in it. That was worth a lump of coal. So if you created 20 accounts

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:18.800
and you added 10 games to your wishlist, you could then pipe all of those other 19 other

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:26.180
coals to your, so some of them weren't necessarily game achievements. It was just steam interaction.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:32.160
Then I'm sure I have a coal. So I'm too good for coal. What are you talking about? We want

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.520
diamonds. I guess what sky is trying to say is that if you're forever alone dot JPG, the

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.540
sales isn't for you then apparently cause you need a, you need a, you need a partner

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:47.960
to help you do this. No forever alone on steam. Um, some folks are talking about Skyrim and

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.200
I just wanted to say, cause this made me think about, you've been playing challenge accepted

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.160
cause you don't chat says I want Skyrim on PC for the mods. The mods are going to be

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.920
sick. I've been playing on PlayStation three and I've been watching Alan play it on PC

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.680
and I'm like, no, I kind of want it on PC cause like you had a inventory mod or something

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:11.040
that yeah, I downloaded a mod from Skyrim nexus that basically makes managing your bag.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.600
Like I can sort by weight so I can see what all the heavy shit is that's weighing me down

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:20.120
so I can get rid of it. I can sort by weight. I can sort by, yeah, so it's an awesome add

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:26.200
on to make bag management and Skyrim awesome and you can do that on PS three. So act Defton

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.800
chat says, guy, you really have no idea. There are people with over a hundred multiple accounts.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.680
Good thing they got banned. Well yeah, good thing they got at least valve band them. Some

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.920
companies may not have even caught it. So you know, at least they got banned. But yeah,

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.080
I agree that, you know, I don't think valve is this type of company though. Again, I just

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.680
kind of look at their track record. Steam overall has been a great thing for the community.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:51.720
It really has. Yeah. Um, and I think in the long run they'll kind of look back at this

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.360
and go, okay, next time we need to, if we're going to give somebody coal for getting their

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.880
wishlist done, we need to make it so that they can't trade that to somebody else who's

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.720
already unlocked it for the same reason. Like they'll go back to the drawing board and I

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.440
think they'll fix it for next time or they'll do something different. You know, they'll,

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.840
they'll learn from it. I think they will, but it does. It does suck that it had its

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:18.080
issues this time. Um, all right, let's move on with more news. Gosh, we're having a long

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.080
show.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.040
Let me show the story that I was going to read. How about it? I guess I can lift that

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.320
cease and desist order. Well, actually it was a Activision that put out the cease and

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:36.880
desist on a dude who hacked Skylanders Spyro adventures. Anyway, um, this guy named Brandon

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:43.760
Wilson had a hacked the game to where basically figured out the conversation between the piece

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.240
and the game so that he could basically mount any piece he wanted to in the game. And so,

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:56.880
uh, so, so he figured out how that little, little, uh, um, toy and portal magic portal

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.680
were talking to each other and he got, he put it up on the internet, which of course

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:07.440
that's what they send out the cease and desist. Right. And, um, he wrote out, um, a note that

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.900
said, you know, what, uh, that the accusations were inaccurate, you know, that he wasn't

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.360
really sharing them with other people. He had them on a zip file for his own use and

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:24.200
he wasn't circumventing the game. He was basically just using stuff that was available and not

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:32.360
using, um, uh, the hardware on a iOS device. And he didn't really trick anything. So he

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:37.440
just, he just figured it out. He just found it out. He didn't actually use it. Well, are

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.440
you able to rip off Activision by doing this? Like you can't just suddenly magically buy

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:48.320
the figure. You can just make the, if you use another system to make it think you have

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.360
the figure, but doesn't, isn't there still like a code for the DLC? Like you can't just

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.780
magically download something that isn't there. Right. Like would you be able to exploit and

01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:00.480
steal money from Activision by doing this? Or is it just, you figured out how magnets

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:07.340
work? Yeah. You figure out how magnets. Well, I mean, but I mean, there are inevitably going

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:11.420
to be, would it be somebody that wants to know how the magician does the trick? Well,

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:16.880
I'm double checking something on here. He basically just found out how they connect.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:23.100
So I'm trying to find where exactly he listed that. I'm pulling up. I'm asking chatter says

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:28.640
I have not played Skylanders yet. So chatters, how do you, do you have to have a code to

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:36.640
get the DLC? Um, RFID and uh, as soon as just playing the seat to figure out how to work,

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.800
how it worked and he put up the way it worked. And so I guess maybe it's Activision is afraid

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:46.480
that someone's going to use that to seal. Oh, no. You mean if the game is successful,

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.760
people are going to try to rip it off? If it's successful. Yeah. I understand it's been

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:58.160
doing all right. So anyway. Yeah, I think that's pretty much it. I think he just got

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.840
bored, figured it out and save the information for himself and then people, and then activings

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.920
like, Oh my God, people are going to use it and steal from us. All these five year olds

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.960
with their toys. And so, uh, dark to see in chat says this talk of Skylanders makes me

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:19.400
want a new version of barcode battler. I wish you could see how I would just rolled my eyes.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.920
I remember those things are awesome subbing for Loki tonight. Should I be throwing shit

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.200
and screaming about Skylanders? Cause we're talking, we're talking about it. Go ahead.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.960
But don't throw anything cause all the stuff near you is heavy. No, I was going to say,

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.120
this is, I wouldn't throw stuff in dark Sakura's house either, but like everything that I would

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:40.960
hit with stuff that we own. So Skylanders makes me very angry there. It's my Loki rant.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:48.440
That was a pretty crappy impression. All right. Uh, folks in, in chat aren't really, um, uh,

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.880
able to answer the question about Skylanders, but I do see Derek H says, Oh, well of course

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:55.560
there's a delay. There's like a minute delay. Derek H in chat says, so corporations are

01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:02.760
now trying to make it illegal to learn. I think it's the specifics they don't want getting

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:08.340
out there. You know, again, I, I don't think it's a big deal. I mean, if this, cause they're,

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:13.000
if this guy can reverse engineer the thing and figure out how it works, don't you think

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.680
EA's already got somebody on it? They're just not going to post to the internet that they

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.080
figured out how it worked. You know, they, they probably emulated it already or either

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.680
they have their competing version for their own franchise franchise is going to come out

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.920
at the end of next year. You know, I think the thing is though, if that, if this somehow

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.480
allows people to download free DLC, then that's going to be an issue. But at the same time,

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.700
if they didn't think that far ahead, then I don't want to say they deserve it, but they

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:48.560
were asking for it. Hackers going to go cry, cry me a river, build a bridge and get over

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.240
it. Well, I'm pretty sure those figures have to come with a code that you have to input

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.120
to actually get the DLC. Otherwise the figure just, you know, tells the portal, this is

01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.060
the one I want to use or, you know, maybe we take it to friends houses, whatever. Well,

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:06.860
if it works, if it works on just, you know, talking to, because I think that that would

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:11.080
make sense to not exactly have a code for it, but to have it just, you put the figure

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.960
down and it connects. I think that they might've been confident that no one would be able to

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.760
figure it out. But then again, that was, that was, that was a dumb assumption. That was

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.480
a stupid, stupid assumption. How many other video game companies have done the same thing

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.600
is what I'm saying. Again, I don't want to say they deserve it. Our security is foolproof

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:34.120
too. If that's, I don't want to say they deserved it in that case, but derpy do. That wasn't

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.960
a smart decision. No, but, but it's been going around. It's a common thing amongst, you know,

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:44.200
developers. No one's going to figure this out. Let's just, you know, be all confident

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:51.840
and kiss our own asses. No. So. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.760
some release dates, some games that are coming to a store near you. I kind of don't think

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.000
there's a lot this week. Wonder what that could be. Could it be that the holiday period

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.440
is now over? So, uh, but we'll see if there's anything after all. Um, Alan, you're filling

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:10.840
in for Loki tonight. What about the US releases? Well, according to, um, the source that we

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:18.840
use, it looks like there's one solitary, sad little game coming out this week. Um, it's

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:25.000
going to pick up next week. I believe on the 10th is a, is some of the 2012 for Q1 releases.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.840
I think you start, especially towards the 31st. I think you have a couple of big ones

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:34.040
on the 31st. But between now and the next episode of OLR, we have Anarchy Reigns for

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:40.760
the 360 and that is it. And I couldn't tell you the thing about it. So there you go.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:44.960
Um, I'm going to Japan to look at, well, I'm not going there physically, but I'm going

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.160
to look at their releases of things that are coming out and I got to tell you, I don't

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:52.840
see a damn thing coming out in Japan. I'm looking quickly to see if even the 3DS. Well,

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.400
don't they have any week two VITA stuff or did it just have it launch? Nope, it just

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.880
had this big launch. The next big game coming out is Wipeout 2048 on January 19th and Tales

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:07.320
of Innocence. It comes out on the 26th. Otherwise, you know, they already, you had a huge launch

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:11.760
and you're not going to wait one week to put out your game. So did you hear those stories

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.720
though about that? Apparently the 3DS is outselling it already in week two. Someone in chat was

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:24.640
saying that I think it was Ranma. It was like LOL at VITA. So, Hmm. Maybe this was the 3DS

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:30.600
strategy the whole time. Sure. Right. Yeah. But you know, whatever it is, it'll be interesting

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.280
to see if, if the numbers are the same here. You know, I don't want to be all like fan

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:39.560
boy and root for one or the other. I'm interested in both, but it's certainly not a good sign.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.820
If you look at the technology of what the VITA has feature wise and what it's trying

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:48.440
to do versus the 3DS, which is just, Hey, it's a polarized 3D screen that you don't

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.560
need glasses for. I think the VITA is trying to accomplish more with the technology that's

01:21:53.560 --> 01:22:00.220
in it. But Hey, sometimes that just goes to show bleeding edge technology and you know,

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:05.440
the perks aren't necessarily what move the system. All right. Well, um, no releases in

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:10.120
Japan this week. So how about Europe? Well, to quote a line from one of my favorite movies,

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:17.760
space balls, we ain't found shit. That's it. A very slow release. One game coming out in

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.040
the entire world. I personally don't give a crap about us coming out on the 10th. What's

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.680
that? That Gotham city imposters. What is your hatred for Gotham city imposters? It

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:31.360
looked, it looked silly, silly, cute. That's kind of part of my problem. It's like, it's

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.320
a bunch of wannabes and you know what? If I'm going to play a wannabe, I'll just play

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:44.260
DC universe online, which I can't follow that. I can't follow that. And it was shit. Wait

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:51.680
a minute. I, it was shit. I wouldn't say it was shit. Okay. It was, um, here a fart. Here's

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:57.840
it. Look, DC universe was definitely not. Wow. DC universe felt more like teenage mutant

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.280
Ninja turtles, the arcade game than it did. Wow. I hate the control. And if you're not

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.840
into that, then you're, of course you're not going to be into DC universe and I hate the

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.800
camera, but I thought PVP was a lot of fun in DC universe. I gotta say I, but you're

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.520
not a player versus player kind of person. No, I'm not. And I will dabble in it. I'll

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:18.560
experiment with my previous statement. And if I want to play a superhero game, I'll go

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:25.440
back and play city of heroes. That's fair. And if I want to play, um, a game by that

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.820
company, I'll just play Star Trek online, which I'm going to once it's free. Isn't that

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:37.960
later this month? Yes, it is. I've been reading on the road to a F2P blog that is every time

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:43.120
that they do an expansion or something, it's road to whatever. So now they've got, um,

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:51.580
number 25 of the road to F2P, uh, blog going on. So I'm pretty excited. Well, of course

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:56.400
you've ruffled the feathers of our chat room, dark Sakura. I don't give a shit. Brad from

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:03.360
pod culture says, Oh no, she didn't. Oh yes I did. Tiger cloth says Gotham city imposters

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:09.440
looks amusing. It looks like a bunch of people in bad cosplay costumes shooting. Yes. Yes,

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:16.640
yes, yes. And if I want bad cosplay, I'll go to Fana Mae where there's occasionally

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:25.560
some good cosplay. Derek, Derek H has drawn a line in the sand and says city of heroes

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:30.200
is a lot crappier than DC universe online, but it has better control and better camera.

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.920
Alan, you, you were a DC universe or excuse me, you were a city hero stand for quite some

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.880
time. I just played it for like 20 minutes just yesterday. It's free to play now. Um,

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:44.400
city of heroes has a very strong RP community and it's still kicking. So yeah, that's say

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:48.280
sea of heroes is, but if you're not into RP, like I don't know when I, when I listened

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.960
to dead pixel live and what I know of Derek H, he doesn't strike me as somebody that's

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:57.140
really into RP. I mean, it might, it might be like a, you know, the secret lives of,

01:24:57.140 --> 01:25:01.560
you know, that, that, that, but I just don't get that. That's why he plays games. My favorite

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.800
thing to do though was in city of heroes make costumes, which is actually the same thing

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:11.680
that the only thing I like doing in DC universe. Why are you playing Barbie the game? You should

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:18.720
see how I play Sims. I spent all my Sim game building the damn house and deciding what

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.320
they're going to look like. That's what you fucking do in the Sims is you build a house.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:28.300
But I don't do any of the get married and have babies shit. If I do anything, it's go

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:33.320
sit in the park and play guitar and get a lot of money and then go home. Hack computer,

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.280
go home. You are living out your fantasies of being a bum. That's what you're doing in

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:43.200
the Sims. You are living out your fantasies of being a bum. No, I can do that in real

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:51.920
life. I'm unemployed. No. All right. Fun, employed, fun, employed. Let's move on a couple

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.400
more news stories for you guys. Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:03.640
But first, Alan. Well, we have another classic game story before Dark Sakura gets into hers.

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.120
For those who remember the Sierra Online text adventure games, the big three franchises,

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:15.840
King's Quest, Space Quest, and Police Quest. Well, the fandom community for those games

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.200
is still going strong and a group called... You forgot Quest for Glory. Yeah, Quest for

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.160
Glory came later. Oh, judging you so hard right now. I love that series too. Infamous

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:31.760
dash adventures dot com just released their HD fan community remake of Space Quest II,

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:38.440
Vohaul's Revenge. The original came out in 1987. Space Quest only had two games that

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.880
were the really blocky 16 color EGA graphics. Why are you smirking? What do you want to

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.600
say? No, I'm looking at chat. I'm not smirking at you. I'm just looking at chat. I promise.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:57.880
And then Space Quest III, The Pirates of Pestilon had a graphical update, even though it was

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:03.880
still text-based. But yeah, Space Quest II is probably the best one of the whole franchise

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:09.040
to be honest, or at least before they went to point and click. It took them five years

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.360
to get this out there. But yeah, it looks like on the 30th of December, just two days

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:20.360
ago, it's final. You can play Space Quest II with updated graphics due to the things

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:25.160
to the fans that go through and revamp this stuff. I would really suggest if you are interested

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.960
in this at all, you grab it now. It's free, right? Yeah. So you should probably grab it

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.740
now because as soon as everybody gets back to work on Monday and the lawyers are back

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:38.700
at work, there'll be a cease and desist letter. Any predictions tomorrow? Tuesday? This gets

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:45.560
cease and desisted? What do you think? I think by Monday, five o'clock. See, there's a different

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:51.040
community that remade King's Quest III, and I think four, Perils of Rosella, which I think

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.120
when I sat in for Dark Sakura was my pick for classic game. Those are still up there.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:00.080
Those didn't get C&D'd. Really? Well, what about the whole silver lining thing? That

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.380
was a new property, I think is why. And then the fact that King's Quest... Telltale Games

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:08.440
is getting a new property. Right. And at the time we didn't know that King's Quest had

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:13.480
been handed off and there's gonna be a new one coming out from Telltale. And that silver

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:17.200
lining went through this whole ugly thing where it was like, yes, you can do the game

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.880
as a fan game. No, you can't do it at all. Okay, yes, you can do it, but it can't say

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:28.120
King's Quest on it. I mean, finally it fucking came out. But if that's what... I kind of

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.160
look at what happened to the silver lining and I'm like, this is not gonna last. Yeah.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:36.320
There are fan remakes of some of the original King's Quest games that I know are still out

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.800
there that have been out for a year more. Also, King's Quest is Roberta and Ken Williams

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.040
and Space Quest is the two guys from Andromeda, Mark and Scott. And Roberta don't give a fuck

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.080
anymore. Yeah, she's... She has said fuck off to the game industry. She lives in a cabin

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.780
in the Yosemite. She has accomplished the American dream of living in a fort and get

01:28:54.780 --> 01:29:01.680
off her property. Yeah. You know, bless her heart. But the fact that she did King's Quest,

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.360
somebody else owns it now. That's a pro. It's probably why she bought a fort. Yeah. You

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:13.880
know, and I'm not lying. I believe that she does live like in a outwards, you know, type

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:18.360
of thing. Yeah, but Space Quest 2 definitely improved on the first one. It's hard as hell.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.320
It's text-based. Save often because you will die and it's possible, like with some of the

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:28.480
other Sierra games, to save your game past a point where you didn't pick up the item

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.880
that you need to beat the puzzle and you literally have to start over. And I just want to be

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.040
clear when I joke about the whole cease and desist thing. I don't want to see this thing

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:41.880
get cease and desisted. I think this is a great, you know, imitation is the finest form

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.560
of flattery. Yeah. And obviously people have very big spaces in their hearts for these

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.160
types of games of yesteryear. I will probably if I can download this and play it because

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:54.440
I used to love these games. You know, I was more of a King's Quest person than a Space

01:29:54.440 --> 01:30:00.400
Quest, but nonetheless I'll still play and check it out. But I just, you know, I also

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.520
unfortunately am all too familiar with the business side of things and how these things

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.760
tend to get shut down. So we'll see. Well, just this last year, Streets of Rage got the

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:13.120
super hella fan remake and that was one, two and three plus a bunch of extra fan added

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:19.360
crap. That was up for a week before Sega was like, nah, nope. Take the hint game companies.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.840
I mean, I realized Telltale's like kind of trying to crank those out and that's kind

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:30.960
of their niche now, but you know, they can't do everything. So maybe people want to see

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.920
it. They can try. It's Vivendi Activision that I think has the Sierra properties. I

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.800
will say I am stupid excited for a new King's Quest game from Telltale. I think it's going

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:45.120
to rock. Yeah. So I just, you know, please don't let me down with this Telltale. Please,

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.600
please don't let me down with it. But I, I'm, I have high hopes for that. That's, that's

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:54.200
a series that has been gone from the gaming community far too long as King's Quest. These

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:58.520
other games and King's Quest eight mask of eternity was a horrible nightmare. It never

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:02.480
really happened. So just, you know, I would have moved into a fort too if I pushed, put

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.920
that game out. Yeah. Yeah. Well no, that wasn't her, but I thought it was no mask of attorney

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:11.440
was developed by nothing to do with Kings. I thought she still kind of oversaw it or

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:15.320
her name was just on it because she ended grant. The plot of it was about some night

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:22.400
goat arriving in Daventry and becoming King after King Graham. But that the whole style

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:27.360
of it, cause it was like I so view three D where you like, it was like an action game.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.600
It was, it was, it was awful is what it was. Yeah. So yeah, no, that wasn't Roberta Williams.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.440
Huh? All right. I thought for some reason she had something to do with it, but maybe

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:41.440
it's just because she invented King's Quest and all. Anyhow, moving on. Uh, some stuff

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.000
that is coming to Xbox live arcade, thanks to all these different ratings boards around

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.720
the world, we know some of the games that are becoming to Xbox live arcade within the

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:55.220
next year. And there's some interesting things that are on here. Uh, AMY, but the battle

01:31:55.220 --> 01:32:00.180
rising bang bang racing, deep black episode one and two defenders of our Dania dungeon

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:07.520
fighter live happy action theater haunt. I am alive. Uh, next week's coral Rayman three

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:13.760
hood, limb havoc, retro city rampage. That's that grand theft auto. We type game, uh, saints

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:18.840
row money shot, a spinoff game that apparently from what I was reading about this game, it's

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:23.920
some type of little mini game where you play the bullet and you try to go through as many

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:29.080
things as possible as the bullet. It sounds very over the top and very saints row, a scary

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:35.000
girl shank to the Simpsons arcade game that had been leaked earlier. Uh, sign Mora, Sonic

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.960
the hedgehog for episode two, uh, spelunky Tetris party challenge, warp world gone sour

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.040
and racketeer. That is like a compilation of everything over the past few months that

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:51.120
has been leaked from ratings boards and other websites. Uh, that's what the roster will

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:57.160
look like for 2012. That's a good six months or releases right there. I'm sure. So there

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:03.120
you go. All right, well, we've been talking a lot about classic games and indie games

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:10.760
and so forth. We need to take a step back in time to a simpler time when there was no

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:17.960
DLC or patches for games. If the game was broke, it was just broke. It's dark soccer

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:22.360
has picked a broken game. Just kidding. It is a little broken. Sometimes dark soccer

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:26.080
has picked a mighty fine game as a classic game of the week. And as I understand tonight,

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.200
kind of a, a nod to, you know, I don't usually pick these kinds of games, but that, that

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.680
dot, right? Well, actually it was one that I found myself enjoying quite a bit when it

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.520
came out. So this is going to be surprising to a lot of people, even though I've brought

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:49.680
it up before and the game is WWF WrestleMania 2000 for Nintendo 64. Yeah, I, I, I said it,

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:57.920
I picked it with its bad guitar synthesizer sound. Um, basically it, um, it came out in

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:04.720
1999 or it actually came out in 2000 in Japan for Nintendo 64. It was, um, based off of

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:13.320
their annual pay-per-view event. And honestly, this was when I was watching WWF regularly,

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:23.560
you know, during their whole attitude thing. It was the NWO and, uh, China, China. Yeah.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:32.720
Oh man, that one was a mess. I was a big China fan at the time. You know, back when, uh,

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:38.840
everyone was laughing because, um, Stephanie McMahon got boob implants, like, and you can

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:44.240
totally tell the difference between one episode and the next. And you know, all the best divas

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:54.080
coming out at the time, you still had, um, uh, fabulous moolah and, uh, what was her

01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:02.020
name? May, May, what's her name? Her buddy. They were, you know, we were both fantastic

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:07.640
wrestlers in their day. You're asking the wrong people wrestling trivia. May young,

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:13.800
May young, who would threaten to show her puppies. That was, that was like the best

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:19.500
era of wrestling ever. You know, you had Test back in the day and you had, uh, the Hardy

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:29.480
Boys and, uh, Kidman. Um, I remember his last name, but that was like the time that I would

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:34.120
totally be into wrestling. And Dan and I were both watching it and we loved it. So when

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:38.400
this game came out and everyone's like, this is the best wrestling game ever. You gotta

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:48.200
get it. Guess who got it? That was us. So, um, when it came out, it actually had like

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:54.280
this amazing story mode. You had Royal Rumble, you had King of the Ring, you had, uh, the

01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:00.480
pay-per-views. Yeah. And the, the story modes were like watching the TV episodes, all the,

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:06.280
the, you know, steroidal man drama you can handle. Cause honestly I think that wrestling

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:17.880
is, uh, um, soap operas for straight dudes. No, some of the chatters are chiming in. Um,

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:24.020
you know, we're a little bit delayed here. May young, uh, ivory Tory Wilson, Lita, Billy

01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:32.360
Kidman, attitude era, reality era. Yeah. And you know, you also had a lot of stuff going

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.400
on with, uh, Steve Austin. So there was that going on too. Yeah. I have never played this

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:40.800
game, but I'm loving in the background. I see some of the signs. One of the signs says

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:49.960
China suck it. That's awesome. I was hugely into WWF at the time. Um, like all babies

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.920
kids were, but there was a part where I think half of it was that I kind of grew out of

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:59.920
it and then half because I remember it was Roddy Piper versus Hulk Hogan. That was the

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.920
big, that was the, that was the big war of good and evil was Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:11.320
And then a lot of the major characters left and it was stone cold. It was stone cold Steve

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:17.540
Austin that brought it back from the doldrums because they had an icon again that they could,

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:21.460
you know, he was, he was awesome. But by then I think I had outgrown it. Um, I remember

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:26.240
playing some of the, the PS one wrestling games that were good though. Yeah. Well I

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.800
have to tell you about, okay, the create a wrestler mode in this was actually super good

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:36.560
and they had a lot of the moves of some of the famous Japanese wrestlers who, because

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.480
what happens I think is that they saved the same engine and use it for like, um, whatever

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:49.940
the fire pro wrestling and the various ones over there. Um, but it had all the signature

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:55.660
moves and you could do custom, uh, a stage entrance when you did the create a character

01:37:55.660 --> 01:38:00.320
so you could actually design everything that happened when they come out on the end of

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.200
the ring. You could choose their starting music and it would actually have loops of

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:10.040
some of the original music, but you know, it's an incentive 64 cartridge. It was really

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:16.400
limited on the samples that it can handle. Um, but it was just super fun. I mean, we,

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:25.720
Dan and I made this guy who is in degeneration X. Yeah, yeah. NWO was a WCW. Degeneration

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:34.640
X was the big one for, um, for WWF and we made this guy and he won every match and we

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.440
would just put him in autoplay mode so you could just watch him play. And, um, he went

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.580
every match in every title, including the women's belt. He beat China for the women's

01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:50.920
title and it was just so super fun. It was a really fun game, but like some of the characters

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:58.480
that you had, the road warriors and Hulk Hogan and Taka Michinoku, who was a legend in Japan.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:06.960
He did not get enough nods over here. You had, uh, um, you could actually create some

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:13.800
of the WCW characters because, um, I believe it was THQ, but they had the same, um, they

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.640
had done the other games too. So you could actually recreate Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Scott

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:27.680
Hall, you know, you can even make Macho Man. Uh, there were, um, if you had two, if you

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.840
were doing a tag team match and you actually picked people who were on the same team, it

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.120
would, you know, have them be introduced under their team name instead of just their individual

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:44.120
names. Um, you had, uh, all kinds of stuff. I think you could also do Hell in a Cell and

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.340
you could do, uh, I don't think you could do, I don't remember if the ladders, tables

01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:54.760
and chairs matches were in it at the time, but those were pretty fun too. Um, you actually,

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:59.400
the commercials, I remember they were funny too because you had the Rock, um, doing Christmas

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:06.840
themed ads. Yeah, Kane was in it and the under faker, I mean the under biker, I mean the

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.080
undertaker. He's still around, right? Yeah, he's still doing it. I don't know why because

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.280
that man's had knee surgery and back surgery and everything else, surgery. You know, what

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:21.760
was the best about this? It had mankind in it. Oh wow. I remember him. Uh, Mick Foley.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:28.780
Yes. And Mr. Sacco. He would put a dirty sock on his hand with a mouth drawn on it and shove

01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:35.680
it in people's mouths. Oh, even I remember that. That was awesome. I remember insane.

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:42.520
I had to learn wrestling because one night and this, you can, I know this was the doing

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.880
of Travis and Jessica over at under station live because we used to all do Rocky horror

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:50.600
in Sacramento together. We did a wrestling night one night. I don't know who's suggesting

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.880
that was, but I somehow think Jessica was a part of it. I don't know why she has the

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.200
metal blade. I remember she was heavily involved in that, but I had to learn wrestling because

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.960
I had to play one of the characters because we did, we did, we played wrestling people

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:10.220
in Rocky horror. That was the invention of the metal bull bra. Yes, it was. I was supposed

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:17.680
to be Steve McMahon, the owner guy as Vince McMahon. I was Vince McMahon. Yeah. At least

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.960
I didn't say Ed McMahon. I was Vince McMahon as riffraff was fun. Cause like I had, I had

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:29.240
the sister or daughter or something. It was magenta and we were like boobs and we were,

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.040
you know, like riffraff and magenta in the movie. That's pretty funny. If you're into

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:38.220
Rocky horror, it was really funny. Like it's like, seriously, one of the most, um, fun

01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:42.020
fucking shows we ever did because we actually had our own TLC match. It was tables, ladders

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:51.800
and cookie sheets. I'm sitting in front of the bar and we had a fucking table and a ladder

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:58.160
and a cookie sheet. That's great. And you know, I miss, I miss, um, the deadly boys

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.080
because they would actually set the, they used to be in ECW, which was like the really

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.600
hardcore wrestling association and they would just set tables on fire and throw each other

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.720
through it. Anyway, anyway, sorry, back to games. Anything else you want to say about

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.560
the game? Um, you could get special copies that had a special hologram card with it that

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:23.760
had, um, different pictures of in game action, like an entrance or a finish. So, but I mean,

01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:28.720
it was just an awesome game and it had everything at the time that you would expect to see on

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:35.000
TV. And yeah, the music was kind of crap, but who cares? It was fun. And I mean, and

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:41.280
like I said, Dan and I would just, I would spend hours making a character and then let

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.640
them watch him play. Just watch him play it. Like we had that one dude who was in purple

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:53.960
and lime green who beat everybody. And I think he had like Sean Michael's hair. So, so he

01:42:53.960 --> 01:43:00.440
had a bullet. All right. Anything else to say about wrestling? I miss when wrestling

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:06.640
was good. Some of the chatters would say it's still good. All right. There it is. Your classic

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:11.680
game of the week. Alan was going to say, you don't like John Cena, the John Cena era. I

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.560
like John Cena. I do like John Cena. I have to say, I like him because he doesn't look

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:25.440
over-weighted and he's actually good. I liked the rock because he wasn't acting then name

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:33.080
a good movie with the rock in it. Can't do it. I was actually going to say, um, the mummy

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:38.760
too, cause he was in it for five seconds and he was, whatever. All right. I did like scorpion

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:45.280
King. We're done. That's classic game of the week. That man looks good in tight pants.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:54.320
WWF. Yes, because it was the WWF back then. WrestleMania 2000 on the Nintendo. All right.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.920
We're going to take a break. When we come back, we have plenty more horizontal to come,

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.680
including the all important, the moment you've been waiting for all night. I'm sure game

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:05.760
of the year, 2011 discussion. I don't know what dark soccer is going to pick. I don't

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.840
know what Alan's going to pick. They may not. They, they don't know what I'm going to pick.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:12.360
Alan thinks he knows, but maybe I changed my mind. So I'm worried at least one or two

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:15.900
of ours will be the same. So, well, we'll see. It's okay. Because you know, there is

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:19.240
no right or wrong answer. Also your picks for game of the week. We're going to come

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:25.640
up with the OLR game of the year for 2011. All when we come back, um, you might be surprised.

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.800
We'll see, or you might not be. We'll see. So we'll be back with plenty more of orange

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:40.740
launch radio right after this. Stay tuned. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:47.760
We are live on this first of January, happy new year, 2012 with the 440th episode of our

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:52.320
show from the new studio set up. Although if everything's been done, right, you shouldn't

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:56.320
really be able to tell at all that it's a new setup. Uh, Rob Roberts, of course here

01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:01.280
with you with dark Sakura and Alan tonight filling in for Loki. It occurred to me, I

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.480
realize why we have less background noise and extra reverberation. What's that carpet.

01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:11.240
That's yeah, that's a big part of it is that you don't have the sound bouncing everywhere.

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:15.180
Yeah. It's kind of the way it's partitioned is differently too. It's just, you know, setups

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:19.640
are going to be weird. So, uh, anyhow, Loki of course, we'll be back next week. I don't

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.360
want anyone thinking funny business is going on, but it is technically a holiday and, and

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.400
uh, he, like many other people has to go back to work tomorrow. So I think there's a dinner

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.120
thingy going on tonight that he's at. So, uh, he'll be back next week to talk game of

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.880
the year with us. Uh, but the three of us that are here tonight, we'll get into our

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:39.280
game of the year picks here shortly, but first we've got to talk about some rapid fire news.

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:45.120
So Alan, since you're filling in for Loki tonight, why don't you start us off by the

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.640
way, it was a slow news week. So, uh, there's kind of some less stories and we usually have

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:58.880
just, you know, yeah, there is a MMO coming out in China, I believe called the age of

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:05.100
Wulin and a certain gentleman, uh, who wants to play this game very much went to an auction

01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:11.520
being held by the developers, snail games. And, uh, basically he bought an online item

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:15.540
for his character. Once this game comes out, he's going to have, I guess some Epic God

01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:25.840
tier sword for his character that he spent, um, us dollar equivalent $16,000 for, for

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:33.140
a weapon for his tune in a game that no one knows sort of gigantic E penis if it's even

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:38.400
a good game or not. Now looking at the screenshot and I think this is a, um, yeah, the, the

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.800
official age of Wulin trailer it's on YouTube. It looks pretty. So vision, I mean, obviously

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:49.120
it's not some back alley studio that is making an ugly game. It looks pretty, but yeah, 16

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:57.940
grand for an Epic item. Also at this auction, they sold a, a sheath, meaning not a weapon.

01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:01.840
It's the thing that you put your weapon in for your character for the hook of departure

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:11.480
for $1,600 and another sheath for the Lordly spear. I'm not, yeah, uh, for 2,500 just does

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:16.680
he get his name in the game or any special thing for spending this much money? I mean,

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:20.380
I don't know. Like I've heard of people like spending a lot of money on an eBay auction

01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:26.120
because they can win a role in the game or the money goes to charity or you know, something.

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:30.280
But this doesn't appear to be the case. It sounds like, um, I would hope that this item

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:34.200
would be bound to his account. So whatever character he rolls can use it. Maybe he'll

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:39.200
be able to kick everyone's ass in PVP. I don't really know enough about the game to know

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:45.160
what this is going to do for him, but it looks like he received a commemorative plaque that

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:50.560
with his name engraved on it by a snail games saying the, you know, thou, Oh, this you now

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.680
own this sword and you're awesome cause you gave a 16 grand for it. Um, and it's a one

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:59.460
of a kind items. So the graphic, I guess of visually the texture of how the sword looks

01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:03.560
in its name and its stats, he's the only one in the whole system that's going to have it.

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:08.720
So his EP will be even bigger. Yes. You know what? When I would do stuff like that for

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:16.900
my private servers on Ragnarok online, I would pay $5. Yeah. And I, when I was in the city

01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:22.440
of heroes, I would buy their costume packs, which was about three to six bucks for like

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:25.880
mutant. Cause you know, when city of heroes like dark Sakura was saying there are millions

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:31.400
of combinations of costumes for your character, some of them were DLC. So I've spent money.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:38.720
Um, I've raised change points. I've raised changed a, my main and wow. Um, I'm just not

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:47.680
spend what you could buy a automobile, uh, for a perk. I have the most I've given blizzard

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:51.860
is that I moved my character twice on wow. And that was, you know, that's 50 bucks that

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:57.380
adds up. And the more I think about it, the more it kind of irritates me because blizzard

01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:00.880
kind of double dips in that way that you pay a monthly fee and you have all these micro

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.000
transactions, but you know, they, they have a quality fucking game. They can get away

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.880
with it for now. Yeah. That's why, that's why the star Wars thing actually excites me.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:14.220
I think competition is healthy. I think competition is going to be very healthy thing. I hope

01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:19.100
star Wars does legitimately, you know, even though I say two games can coexist, I do hope

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:23.560
the two games can kind of tug and pull from each other a little bit. It'll be, it'll help

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:27.640
us all in the long run. And for the record, all the cryptic points, I did a lot of that

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.560
in star Trek online. So that's why I have a defiant retrofit. And yeah, it looks like

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.960
this game in China is entering open beta this spring. So it's, I should sign up for it and

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:43.820
it looks like we are getting it here in the U S but it still needs to be put through open

01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.840
beta in China. So I don't think there's really a due date on when we're going to get it here

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.640
soon. I played Ragnarok online in Korean. Yeah. So did I, I remember that, but for the

01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:57.720
I was like, Jamie, what do I do here? Jamie, what do I do here? You played with me on the

01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.760
American one on the American beta. I thought there was, I remember a translation patch

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.640
for the career. There was a translation patch because some of the NPCs were still in Korean.

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:14.440
Oh, okay. Then. All right. I played that one, but I played the Korean one before that. Whatever

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:19.760
one that great. All right. It was fun. And this article does make a brief mention of

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:24.520
the wank over elder scrolls for oblivion, which of course it was the game that came

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:28.520
out before Skyrim, which is a lot of making a lot of game of the year lists right now,

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:33.760
because oblivion had DLC where you could make pretty armor for your horse that literally

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:38.320
did nothing. It was just, you know, metal for your horse. I kind of think the gaming

01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:43.400
community just needs to let that go. Like I understand that that is the quintessential

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:47.200
like thing that people will point out for DLC, but also at the same time, Bethesda has

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.800
come out and the industry has learned from that mistake that we will not do that again.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.960
That was, you know, you know what, nobody was fucking doing it then and we did it and

01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:04.440
we learned, you know? So, okay. Kind of a break. Anyhow, what else do you have for us?

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:13.880
What do I have for you? Hold on. Pirated games via torrents or use net or whatever a list

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:20.000
is. The Torrent Freak, which is a big sort of underground torrent news site, if a torrent

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.960
site gets, like the Pirate Bay, if they ever get raided, Torrent Freak is usually the site

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:32.160
that reports on it, you know, like, journalistically. They have compiled lists of the top pirated

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:42.880
games via piracy or by digital torrent download. For PC, we've got Crysis 2, Call of Duty Modern

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:46.360
Warfare 3, no surprise there, would have been probably number one if it came out earlier

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:54.160
in the year. Top Wii game downloads, Galaxy 2, Mario Sports Mix, surprisingly, and Xenoblade

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:57.760
Chronicles, which is... What the hell is Gal... Oh, Super Mario Galaxy 2. Yeah, sorry. Super

01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:03.280
Mario Galaxy 2. Perfect. Okay. Mario Sports Mix and number three is interesting, Xenoblade

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.320
Chronicles, which you would think would be a no one cur game, but it's an issue of...

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:16.080
It was translated in English for the Europe market and according to this, the tally, 950,000

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:21.680
confirmed downloads via the various torrents that you could get this game on. And that's

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:27.480
a thing where if Nintendo didn't have their head up their ass and put that out here, then

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:32.360
maybe that number... But they are gonna put it out here, Alan. Yeah, too little, too late.

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:37.600
Anyone here who wanted it either bought it and paid the 90 bucks to import it for their

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:46.280
modded Wii from London or wherever their UK retailer is, or they pirated it. And of course,

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:53.480
Modern Warfare 3 access isn't a problem there because America is the biggest market for

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:58.080
that game and it's just people don't wanna pay 60 bucks for it. So sometimes it's just

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:04.520
an issue of people being cheap. All right. But yeah, and then a top 360 pirated downloads

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:10.120
via BitTorrent. Gears of War 3, no surprise there. And then of course, number two, Call

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:17.520
of Duty Modern Warfare 3. So all the... Mostly the big multiplayer games. All right. Moving

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:25.800
on to a couple... Speaking of piracy and torrents and all that, SOPA exists to try and shut

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:30.520
some of that down, but unfortunately, the way it's written, it leaves room for a lot

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:34.520
of other stuff to go wrong. And so obviously, a lot of internet savvy people are very much

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:38.920
against SOPA. We've talked about it here on this show before. Obviously, we don't support

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:42.960
it either here at Orange Lounge Radio. And it seems like the number of people that are

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:46.400
supporting it are dropping. Obviously, I don't think I need to touch on it here. It doesn't

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:49.840
really directly relate to video games, but I'm sure you've all heard about what GoDaddy's

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:54.380
been going through with this whole thing. And obviously, they had quite a number of

01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:57.900
embarrassing PR stumbles, where I think you were hearing the Benny Hill theme playing

01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:03.060
in the background with every press release. Well, the good news is that Nintendo, Sony,

01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:10.000
and EA have all as well dropped SOPA support. An update to the government's list of SOPA

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.380
supporters show that the names are now no longer on there. Of course, there is no word

01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:21.620
as to why. Is it because they saw the tech community backlash to what happened to GoDaddy,

01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:26.800
or maybe that whole debacle made them rethink the position, or maybe they just, you know,

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:33.060
realized finally it was not a good idea? Whatever the reason, it's a relief to see these gaming

01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:39.620
companies are finally dropping out and taking their names off the list. Hooray.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:43.280
Some more rumors are floating around about Epic Mickey 2. Now, you might remember there

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.660
was an earlier rumor based on a survey that had been out there, some type of like focus

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:52.140
group thing that had people choosing the box art. Well, the rumors are circulating again

01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:55.940
this week because I guess there was an online newsletter that Disney put out that just flat

01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:03.500
out said Epic Mickey 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii in fall of 2012. You

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:09.780
might remember the original Epic Mickey game was a Wii exclusive, but maybe because of

01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:15.160
that or what, it didn't sell maybe as much as it could have. And so it's kind of interesting

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:19.780
in a way that it is getting a sequel after all. Supposedly the sequel, Epic Mickey 2,

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:23.620
will also have co-op play, including two player split screen, which is something we don't

01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:28.580
see in games all the time anymore. One person will be Mickey, the other will be Oswald the

01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.980
Lucky Rabbit. I love Oswald. So that's kind of cool. I like it because Epic Mickey kind

01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:38.660
of brings the classic Disney stuff. I wonder if the bad guy now will be Mortimer. Don't

01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:45.380
know. No word yet if Epic Mickey 2 may actually come out for Wii U instead of Wii. Right now

01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:50.340
they're saying Wii and that the Wii U ought to be backwards compatible. So there you go,

01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:54.780
Dark Sakura. Well, in other news, there's a fun little game that I just purchased today

01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:59.820
called Bastion. And apparently other people have decided to buy it as well because it

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:07.980
exceeded $500,000. And that's an indie game. So I mean, it's really catching on, don't

01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:14.860
you think? At any rate, that's with Steam and Xbox Live arcade sales. So, and my apologies,

01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:23.460
I didn't mean dollars. That's 500,000 copies sold. My apologies. So yeah, good game. And

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.740
a lot of people think so. To be honest with some of the deals on Steam and so forth, I'm

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:31.140
surprised it's not higher. It's a quality game. Well, it's, you know, the story is also

01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:36.740
like from what, a couple days ago? So maybe. Who knows? Who knows? And it just said exceeded

01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:43.540
that. So. And also a really, really hard NES game has been translated into English. It's

01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:51.980
called Takeshi's Challenge. And to quote the article here, the game was made by the devil.

01:56:51.980 --> 01:57:01.180
One of the ROM modders, King Mike, has translated it into English so you can play it. Is it

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:07.180
like Beat Takeshi, the guy that was in Battle Royale? I want to think so. Actually, I'm

01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:13.980
pretty sure that it is, but I can find out. I am the very sure that it is from Beat Takeshi.

01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:18.060
Very cool. Yeah. And he had that, he sees, has the show that's been ripped off here as

01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:22.820
Wipeout, right? And that they didn't, they didn't take Takeshi's castle and they had

01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.820
the dubs that were on here in the States. Didn't they, wasn't that a thing? And that's

01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:34.660
still on? Yeah, it was Takeshi's castle and it was what the ultimate challenge. Yes. Yes.

01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:44.020
Exactly. So, all right. Hold on. What? Um, yeah, Takeshi no cho senjou and it is Beat

01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:51.700
Takeshi, Takeshi Kitano. Nice. All right. Well, before we get into some more news, the time

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:57.140
has come for you to lip sync, wait, no, just kidding. For us to talk about the game of

01:57:57.140 --> 01:58:02.700
the year of 2011. And we're going to go around the table and see what we here at OLR thought

01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:05.580
was the game of the year. We're going to start with a community. Obviously it's the show

01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:10.260
where every gamer has a voice and earlier this week on Facebook and Google plus in our

01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:14.880
communities there, we asked you guys, what do you think is the game of the year? And

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:18.700
I wanted to make sure this is important. You guys understand there's no right or wrong

01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:23.060
answer. The whole point of the show here is that it's where every gamer has a voice and

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:27.600
everybody's into something different. People can only afford sometimes to buy the games

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:33.380
that were from last year or, you know, not everybody is necessarily into RPGs or shooters

01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:38.060
or racers. So I think this is important to really just kind of open it up to like, you

01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:42.300
know, actual gamers that are enthusiastic enough to be listening to a podcast and fan

01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:48.840
their page yet may not necessarily find the same critical darlings to be as successful.

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:54.020
Or maybe they did. I mean sometimes, you know, what the critics pick really is the cream

01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:57.180
of the crop. So let's see. Let's start with the community first and see what some of you

01:58:57.180 --> 01:59:03.520
guys out there said was the absolute bestest game to come out in 2011. Or I'm sorry that

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:07.540
you played in 2011. It may have been a game that actually came out previously. Because,

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:12.940
you know, God there'll probably be some games I don't get to play until 2012. Because 2011

01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:18.620
was so crowded with so many good releases. Can I also start off by saying, it was a great

01:59:18.620 --> 01:59:22.820
year for games. It really was. I know we come in here like every year and say that, but

01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:26.760
well I don't, I actually don't think, I think some people have said, it seems like every

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:32.140
year we keep saying, how are we going to top last year? But I really feel like some years

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:38.140
weren't as good with games. Like I don't remember looking back at last year going this was the

01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:43.500
best year ever for games. But this year was really, really, really good. Alright here's

01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:49.860
some of what you guys picked. Over on Facebook, Zether said number 3 Mario Kart 7, the best

01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:55.300
one. Number 2 Saints Row the 3rd, wacky insane, better than Grand Theft Auto 4 in every way.

01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:58.380
And his number 1 game of the year is Portal 2, an excellent follow up with a very good

01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:04.300
single player campaign and solid co-op. John Keegan said, I shouldn't say the full last

02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:10.540
name, sorry, John K said over on Facebook, best 2011 game, Arkham City, based on the

02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:15.720
variety of missions and improvement on an already awesome original. Otherwise I played

02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:21.980
older games in 2011 of which Assassin's Creed 2 and Uncharted 2 topped the charts based

02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:31.820
on an awesome story and solid gameplay. Derek W said, Resident Evil 4 HD, kind of a remake

02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:38.300
of an older game. Great injection to a boring year of military shooters, looks beautiful.

02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:43.860
Fallout New Vegas download content, the most rewarding and content heavy DLC seen yet.

02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:52.660
And number 1, Skyrim, Fus Ro Dah. Tom S said Skyrim, Skyward Sword and Saints Row 3, didn't

02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:57.180
really give reasons but those are the top 3. Mike B said, Gears of War 3, very well

02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:02.580
done, kind of like a masterpiece of sci-fi shooters. Let me think about the other two.

02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:09.380
Times up! Johnny R says, number 3, Alice Madness Returns, beautifully haunting sequel to one

02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:14.060
of my most beloved games as a child. Number 2, Catherine, excellent puzzle game with a

02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:18.500
rad story to go with it. Number 1, Mortal Kombat, great fighting game that stepped it

02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:24.900
up with an amazing story mode. Oh, Mike B did come up and say, Saints Row 2, yes 2,

02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:36.700
not 3, I just discovered it in 2011. Kashiiko Janai, I think it's DJ Janai, says, number

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:42.340
3, Super Mario Land 3D. I didn't watch a lot of El Hazzard, did I? A great blend of

02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:48.260
traditional Mario and new Mario styles. If only Sonic could achieve this feat, oh snap.

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:53.900
Number 2, Portal 2, funny story, great puzzles, awesome acting. Number 1, Minecraft, the ultimate

02:01:53.900 --> 02:02:03.940
never-ending sandbox of building ADD insanity. OMG! Joe R said, number 3, DDRX3 vs DDR Second

02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:08.660
Mix, still some love for the Bomani games. Well, it was either this or DDR2 and I noticed

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:13.780
they still couldn't get the interface quite right. Number 2, La Mulana on the Wii, no

02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:18.580
surprise there. I think I'm more surprised that it's not number 1. He says, take what

02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:22.700
made Kade's story so great but throw in some extra block and switch puzzles. Also recently

02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:28.340
announced that a PC port will come to Steam. Number 1, The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.

02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:33.420
I'm digging up this one a lot more than Twilight Princess, great game expecting to sink at

02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:39.340
least 30 hours in before I'm done. Bradley B said, number 3, Chime Super Deluxe, adds

02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:44.340
4 good to great songs to the roster and adds perfect quads and changing layouts to further

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:49.740
add to the gameplay. Number 2, Portal 1, or excuse me, Portal 2, oops, number 2 is Portal

02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:55.260
2, all around fun and adds so many more hilarious quotable quotes to the Portal universe. Number

02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:59.900
1, Bastion, the narration makes what would be a pretty good action game a great one.

02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:07.340
The narration adds a story that is full and vibrant and memorable. Miguel I says, Portal

02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:13.580
2, best sequel ever. Forza 4, best driving game to date, a great combination of arcade

02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:18.340
and simulation type racing. And Sequence, DDR and RPG combined into a really fun and

02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:23.420
addicting game. Jim H says, Infamous 2 improves on everything from the first game and the

02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:28.580
user generated content was a great addition. Number 2, LittleBigPlanet 2, any other year

02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:31.700
the sequel to one of my all time favorite games that improves on the original would

02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:38.980
be my number 1. And number 1 was Portal 2. He picked all 2's for his top list. Sticking

02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:42.140
with the theme, it's an improvement on the original, has some of the best storytelling

02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:45.820
and voice acting in gaming history. Add in the great gameplay and that makes it the game

02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:50.420
of the year. Let me quickly run over to Google Plus because we had a few responses over there

02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:59.820
as well. I wanted to read for you guys. And we had from DeadPixelLive commented, F1 2011,

02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:05.300
Forza 4 and Pinball FX2. F1 2011 because it did what a sport sequel is supposed to do,

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:09.380
leave the good stuff in and add more good stuff. Forza 4 because the rival mode made

02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:14.220
driving and competing fun. And Pinball FX2 because at the end of the year I realized

02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:19.980
I had played it more than all my other games. Good reason. We have another response here,

02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:24.220
it's written in Russian so I'm not sure how to say this so I apologize. Dark Soccer, do

02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:31.140
you read Russian? No. Ok, so. Just pipe it through Google Translate. So unfortunately

02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:37.940
name I can't read, sorry ignorant American. Says number 1, Deus Ex Human Revolution for

02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:42.300
a great cyberpunk story and enjoyable gameplay. Too bad Exfer is not here. Exfer can read

02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:47.420
Russian. Little known fact about Exfer. I remember when he was learning. Thanks to Nelly.

02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:52.020
Number 2, Bastion, yeah cuz Loki's wife is Russian. And I remember all of the cards all

02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:56.600
over your apartment and I almost learned to read Russian too. You'd think I'd know more

02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:01.620
after living there but. Anyhow, number 2, Bastion for very polished representation,

02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:05.780
great music and awesome narration. And number 3, The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings for old

02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:11.460
school hardcore RPG brought up to the next level on every aspect. Lastly, Wendy S says

02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:15.880
number 3, Battlefield 3, favorite shooter, loved the way they did multiplayer player.

02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:21.060
Number 2, NHL 12, favorite sports game, realistic simulation of hockey but not inaccessible.

02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:27.180
And number 1, Portal 2 drew me in like nothing else could. So those are some of the responses

02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:34.500
from Facebook and Google Plus. Very diverse. Did you guys catch that? Yes, but I put a

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:40.040
game on my list that they didn't. Interesting. So we're about to get to that here in a minute.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:47.060
I wanted to quickly see if I could bring this up. I forgot to put it in the link or in the

02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:53.020
show role because over on NeoGaf there's a thread where they're actually tracking what

02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:57.900
the media, you know, all the different gaming outlets are naming as the game of the year.

02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:03.100
So I kind of wanted to give you an idea what they were saying, kind of what the rest of

02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:10.300
the internet is saying or what the critics are saying and so forth. Let's see. I'll have

02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:15.460
to try and dig for this a little bit here. Any games that the chatters mentioned that

02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:23.260
you were like, oh, I forgot about that game. No. Because they all like Angry Birds apparently.

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:27.080
I don't think anybody said Angry Birds actually. All right, here we go. I found it. So this

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:30.940
is from NeoGaf. Thank you to the folks over there that tallied this all together. Poster

02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:38.200
was Cheesemeister. Has tallied up what the media. 72 different outlets has picked Skyrim,

02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:43.420
and that's the number one. 22 outlets have picked Portal 2. 17 have picked Batman Arkham

02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:49.280
City. Seven for Zelda Skyward Sword. Seven for Uncharted 3, Drake's Deception. No listener

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:54.260
put Uncharted 3. Very interesting. Four said Gears of War 3. Two said Bastion. Two said

02:06:54.260 --> 02:07:01.260
Catherine. Two said Dark Souls. Two said Deus Ex Human Resolution. Two said L.A. Noire.

02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:04.440
Again, surprised I didn't hear that from any of the chatters either. Two said Star Wars

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:09.320
The Old Republic. Two said Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP. And a handful of other

02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:17.260
games got a mention as well. So, who cares about what the media thinks? Let's talk about

02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:21.220
what we think. You know, I found our certificate where we were listed as the podcast of the

02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:27.180
galaxy. Good. We have a little space on the new studio wall. I'll have to remember where

02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:32.100
I put it. Go to Hobby Lobby and get a frame. Alright, let's go around top three picks.

02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.860
Hobby Lobby my ass. I'm going to the dollar store. We're going to do this kind of like

02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:40.540
we do Listless but without the elimination and not the voting so much. Let's go around.

02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:44.520
And of course, justify your pick. Alan, we'll start with you. What is your number three

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:53.500
pick for best game of 2011? Skyrim. Skyrim. And 72 media outlets agree. I can see that.

02:07:53.500 --> 02:08:01.480
Why did you pick Skyrim? It tries to do something that a lot of game developers are afraid to

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:07.180
do. Bethesda, rather, the makers of Skyrim. Ever since the original two Elder Scrolls

02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:14.500
games which most people haven't played, Arena and I'm blanking on what the second one was,

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:21.060
there were sandbox games before Grand Theft Auto which is where that genre and that term

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:28.340
sandbox game came from. So you can literally do anything if you want to make a plate-wearing

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:35.700
warrior who casts spells. You can go exploring for hours, ignore the main plot completely

02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:42.660
and still have stuff to do. Bethesda with Morrowind and Oblivion and now Skyrim, that's

02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:48.460
always been their thing to make this really immersive, almost impossible to complete game

02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:54.940
and Skyrim is the best attempt at it yet where even I know people in real life that have

02:08:54.940 --> 02:09:01.060
played Morrowind Oblivion and it was such a burden, all this openness. They hated it

02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:05.740
and Skyrim, there's something about it where they get better each time in streamlining

02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:12.980
that combination of keeping your attention plus, holy shit, this is a whole huge world

02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:16.660
to dink around in. Visually, it is gorgeous. It's one of the most beautiful games I've

02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:25.660
ever played, especially on my PC which is now four years old. And yeah, it's for kind

02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:34.160
of a... I get really into exploration and min-maxing stats and doing crafting and Skyrim

02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:40.420
has all of that. It's a great game. Now is it just me or for a game as vast as Skyrim,

02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:45.700
we really need a new fucking meme besides this arrow to the knee shit? I didn't get

02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:51.340
that until I finally was in a town and I heard some dude, I used to be an adventurer like

02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:54.780
you but then I took an arrow to the knee and I was like, oh thank you, it's something that

02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:59.700
some dude says to you. Now I finally get that meme. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was from the

02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:05.620
game but with a game so fucking huge, seriously there has to be something else. The 50,000

02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:09.140
cheese wheels off the mountain was funnier than an arrow to the knee, I'm sorry. There's

02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:15.740
a great picture of the Arl of Whiterun, the first king that you meet, where someone had

02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:21.600
stacked hundreds of carrots, apples, cabbages all over him and they took a picture and he's

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.060
got his chin on his fist like a thinking man on his throne being all kingly and he's just

02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:32.780
surrounded by like cabbages. It's awesome. Alright, DarkSakura, what is your number three

02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:37.940
pick for game of the year? Batman Arkham City. Batman Arkham City, why'd you pick back Arkham

02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:43.900
City? Because, and I honestly didn't play it but I watched Dan play it most of the time

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:47.820
and I just sit back and it's like watching a movie. It's what happens when you're married

02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:51.180
or in a committed relationship, sometimes you let the other person do the driving, I

02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:56.660
get it. Yeah, well, we've done that for tons of games between the two of us so, you know,

02:10:56.660 --> 02:11:03.020
I just sit back and I totally dig the character designs. I love that they got Penguin right,

02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:10.860
that he's this British gangster kind of guy, you know, and Catwoman was absolute hotness

02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:16.580
except it is physically impossible to leap around like you do in four inch heels, just

02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:21.740
like that. But it was, it was gorgeous a lot and had, Dan said that it took a little, you

02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:26.580
know, time to get used to the control but the fact that it also brings over your information

02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:33.580
from the last game is a big bonus. And, oh my god, Joker. Mark Hamill's last performance

02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:39.600
as Joker. Maybe. No, officially. Yeah, but then they went and teased Arkham World and

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:46.060
you're like. He said on Twitter that he would come back specifically for a killing joke,

02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:51.620
animated special. But yeah, it's interesting. Yeah. But throw enough money at him, he'll

02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:55.820
do it. No, I don't think so. Get him better seats at the VGA's next year. But that was

02:11:55.820 --> 02:12:02.060
just like a fantastic performance. And I really liked their Harley too, especially you find

02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:06.460
the little Easter egg and, oops, spoilers, oops, you find a positive pregnancy test in

02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:12.220
their little love nest. And then in one of the endings, she's singing to her baby. So

02:12:12.220 --> 02:12:18.300
it's just lots of neat little things thrown about in there. And the whole business with

02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:21.820
Hush, that was pretty cool because that was actually the last Batman thing I ever read

02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:28.540
was Heart of Hush. I never, I was not a big DC person, but that was a really good storyline.

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:33.300
So yeah, it was really cool. It had lots of nods to just all kinds of different characters

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:41.060
and it was really neat. So that's, and also as a designer, love the design in the game.

02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:46.580
It's beautiful for me. I just have to start off by saying this has been extraordinarily

02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:51.420
hard this year. There have been so many, not just good, but phenomenal games this year

02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:56.700
that I have, like, I, I told Alan like three days ago, what my list was going to be and

02:12:56.700 --> 02:13:00.040
I've changed it since then. I've changed it several times since then. And even now in

02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:04.460
my head, I'm like, do I really want to say this as number three or do I want to put this

02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:09.100
game in there because this game was so fucking good. Um, but I'm, I'm going to just commit

02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:12.880
to what, what I'm going to say here. And I really think, you know, I kind of look back

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:19.380
at fun and what game did I really enjoy? Um, I think my, my number three game of the year

02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:25.780
is, um, Super Mario 3D Land on the 3DS because it, you know, and I said this on the show

02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:30.060
when I first reviewed it, I really think it is the greatest Mario game they have done

02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:36.420
since, uh, the Super Nintendo one. I think it's just the 3D works. It makes you understand

02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:41.700
why a 3DS, you know, can, can work. Um, it's one of those games where you keep peeling

02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:46.260
back the layers and even though it seems like, God, this game is easy as cake in the beginning,

02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:51.340
it just gets crazier and crazier as you move on. Uh, it has a lot of the retro stuff that,

02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:55.600
you know, you know, we love retro games here at OLR that we love. I just, I, it's such

02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:00.300
a worthy reason to own a 3DS. And I think that Mario 3D Land is my number three pick

02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:06.240
for game of the year. I think it might very well be the only 3DS game right now where

02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:13.720
the 3D is more than just, oh, that looks neat. Cool. Absolutely. It's in 3D. When you play

02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:20.020
Super Mario 3D Land, the 3D is an integral, integral part of the gameplay and the experience

02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:26.740
and turning it down, turning that little notch down on the side, like, it damages the game.

02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:31.800
And I love that you can have the, uh, you can invert the 3D too. Like, it's, it's hard

02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:34.940
to explain unless you do it, but it's very easy. You have it pop out or be recessed inwards.

02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:41.660
But it's still 3D. It's great. Uh, and I gotta remind you guys, I think still to this day

02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:47.620
that Mario 64 was quite a bit overrated because of a lot of its move to 3D. Yet I love what

02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:55.800
3D has done to Mario here. I look at myself and I can't justify it. Like, it just works.

02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.460
And that's why I think it's, it's one of the greatest games to come out this year. Absolutely.

02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:10.540
Um, Salacious Pop or Alan, your number two pick. Probably gonna say Dragon Age Origins,

02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:15.560
since you said this could be games that we played, um, in this year rather than came

02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:19.620
out. Uh, one of the reasons why I'm going back to a game from 2009 is that a lot of

02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:23.860
the big, the big A-list games that came out, like Deus Ex, I haven't played them, so I

02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:30.780
don't wanna talk out of my ass and hype up a game I've never played. Um, BioWare, ever

02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:36.060
since, you know, the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG has shown that they are one

02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:43.020
of the best narrative and character writers in the industry. Um, I would say even better

02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:49.780
than Blizzard and Valve. And the twists and the, like, Alistair in Morrigan, who's, he's

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:53.900
the, um, other Grey Warden in Morrigan is the Witch of the Wild, they're the first two

02:15:53.900 --> 02:16:00.460
NPCs you pick up. They're so engaging and I was fascinated with each of them for completely

02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:06.180
different reasons and they were acted and written so well. And I was very invested in

02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:10.980
how I manipulated the game to make sure that I got endings that were right for them. And,

02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:16.620
uh, it's, Origins is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and a lot of the, um, D&D

02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:22.420
game-based games that BioWare wrote in the 90s. And Dragon Age 2, if you play it, which

02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:27.060
I believe that came out earlier this year, um, the menu and the UI, it's all very new

02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:31.140
school. I'm not saying Dragon Age 2 is a bad game, but you can tell right away, even just

02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:38.500
by the menus, that it's a different, Origins really harkens back to the 90s experience

02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:41.100
for me, but with a present-day game or story.

02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:44.300
Alright, so even though you went with a game that's a couple years old, you can do that

02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:47.740
because this is your picks for best game of 2011 and sometimes you don't discover the

02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:48.740
games till later.

02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:54.340
Yeah, so for anyone who overlooked Origins, um, yeah, it's still relevant. Play it.

02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:58.620
Alright, fair enough. Dark Sakura, your number two pick.

02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:07.940
Ultimate Marvel vs. Ca- Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Galactus Flick. Bing! Making my hand hurt.

02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:15.220
Awesome cast. Firebrand. Um, but I still go back and play Phoenix more than anything.

02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:22.420
It's just fun. And She-Hulk, of course, because She-Hulk is hardcore. But yeah, it's just

02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:27.860
a fun fighting game. It brought out all the DLC characters plus more characters that people

02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:35.820
wanted to see except for no freaking Mega Man. But other than that, perfect. Fighting

02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:36.820
game perfection.

02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:41.860
Didn't bother you that it was only six months after the other Marvel vs. Capcom that also

02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:42.860
came out this year?

02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:49.500
No. Not really. I didn't buy any of the DLC.

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:50.500
There you go.

02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:54.620
And you know, the tweaks and the gameplay actually made it worth it. It felt different

02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:55.620
enough.

02:17:55.620 --> 02:18:00.480
Alright. Um, my number two game of the year. It's one that's already been named, but I

02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:07.300
think it's a game absolutely worthy of the list. I never expected to enjoy Batman Arkham

02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:12.900
City as much as I did. And I, you know, I like Batman all the way back to like the Adam

02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:18.860
West Batman. I admit I'm not as into reading the comics. I'm not as into the animated series.

02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:24.140
I mean, I watched it a little bit when I was a kid. So I don't know the Mark Hamill Joker.

02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:27.860
I don't know the characterizations of these characters as much as some of y'all do. But

02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:32.720
I, I'll be damned if I didn't just love this game. I mean, it's just the story in it is

02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:37.020
outstanding. The way they juggle all of the villains without making it seem like cheesy

02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:43.740
or over the top is great. I love the exploration. Love, love, love the grand theft Batman style

02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:49.520
thing that they have going on. Um, I think the DLC has done rather tastefully the way

02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:53.180
you can have, I mean, the whole Catwoman debacle outside where some people didn't have their

02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:56.360
codes, the stuff they kind of been doing beyond that, like the Nightwing and everything I

02:18:56.360 --> 02:19:01.920
think is neat expansions to the game. I love the side missions. It's, it's a rewarding

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:07.160
experience and it's, it's, it's the total package when it comes to a video game. Absolutely

02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:15.080
is. I have to ask you, did you do the, um, the, that were Catwoman abandons Batman? Yes.

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:22.280
Isn't it great? Yes. Screw him. She's such a bitch. Yeah, no, the way that, I mean, just

02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:26.240
the way the characters are done alone, it makes the game outstanding, but just, it's

02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:32.120
just, I think you said it well when you said you didn't even play it and it was like watching

02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:35.880
a movie and that's how good it is. I mean, and then do you even take it a step further

02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:40.480
and actually kind of like get your hands on it and be in control is, is just outstanding.

02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.980
I did actually play a little bit of it. I mean, I'm not going to say I didn't play any

02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:48.840
of it, but it, it was Dan's save and I had, since I'd seen so much of it, I was like,

02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:53.120
there's no point, but I might go back and do it myself now. So much to go back for with

02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:58.800
the Riddler trophies and the little side in the Riddler mission. Oh my God. I barely dented

02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:05.880
that, which is actually pretty messed up. Yeah. And not that hard. So, all right, so

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:12.760
now we're going to go around and get Z number one picks. Oh my gosh, here it is. The game

02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:21.200
of the year. According to us, Alan portal two, it really elevated the first game and

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:27.140
it's very rare for when a sequel makes the game that came before it a better experience.

02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:33.840
It really showed that valve is a heavy hitter when it comes to casting a voice talent narrative

02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:40.160
writing and it's a hilarious game. It's an emotional game. You feel sympathetic for both

02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:47.800
Wheatley and GLaDOS. You would learn so much backstory for pretty much everyone, including

02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:53.760
even shell, if you know how to look for it. And it's, it's a very it's really just holds

02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:57.520
on to you to never let's go. It's, it's, it's quick. If once you beat it once, if you love

02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.520
the story so much, you can run through it again in a couple hours and it never feels

02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:07.880
stale. And it really valve, especially with half-life two episodes, one and two really

02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:14.720
have tried to increase their game as far as script writing and story being told through

02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:18.720
dialogue. But portal two is where they're really like, you're going to listen to this

02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:23.760
and you're going to be invested in these characters. And also here's awesome puzzle, you know,

02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:28.720
puzzle cracking to where you have to need to figure out what to do. So, all right, well

02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:35.880
justified. Dark soccer, your number one game of the year. I will answer it with a sound

02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:47.960
from my phone if it will play. I hope that made it through. It might have a little bit.

02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:53.360
It's a little quiet, but it made through it's a portal to definitely cause for all the same

02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:57.840
reasons that Alan said, and I've beaten it 10 times in single player mode, more than

02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:02.520
10 times now in single player mode, I keep playing through that game. I've probably played

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:08.400
through that game once a month and I go and explore and look for stuff. And while I haven't

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:13.080
done the no clipping trick to, you know, see how the levels are put together, I still have

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:18.480
such a good time every time. And actually, um, I've sat back now and watched, uh, the

02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:22.780
ending through third player mode. So it's kind of funny seeing these disembodied arms

02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:27.680
floating about for Chell instead of, you know, seeing her whole body attached to everything,

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:31.040
you know, but that's, you know, part of the perspective and part of the camera. So it's

02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:37.720
very neat and poor Wheatley. And I love that actor so much. I was watching him on Graham

02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:43.520
Norton one time where he was paid a thousand pounds to be donated to charity to do a somersault

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:50.640
on stage and he had never done one before. And this man is tall. This man is like a moose

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:54.640
for well, people would get my reference from Supernatural, but anyway, he's tall. He's

02:22:54.640 --> 02:23:00.800
very tall, very lanky. I think he's taller than you, Alan. Yeah. And just watching how

02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:05.520
good natured he is and the fact that he brings so much of himself into the character, I thought

02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:13.000
it was perfect. And you can really hear that fun part, even when Wheatley's being an evil

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:19.600
bastard. It's just awesome. So that, and you know, the, the giant mutant potato and all

02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:24.800
of the reoccurring jokes. And I would even, I even went in and tried to find all the stuff

02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:31.000
that did make it into the final game, like the Garfield conversation in co-op mode, where

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:37.200
apparently two little robots, Atlas and Peabody were supposed to go and find a Garfield comic.

02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:43.600
And she glad us rewrites it to say that John Arbuckle filled the house with neurotoxin.

02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:49.680
Too bad it's not Garfield without Garfield. God, that's great. I'll have to find you the

02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:55.760
little file to play. So, all right. Um, my number one game of the year might surprise

02:23:55.760 --> 02:24:03.760
some people. Um, but I, I really had to sit back and go. I don't ever, I don't ever beat

02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:07.640
video games anymore. And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that maybe I play

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:12.880
these MMOs games. You can't beat the fact that I do this show, or I just love video

02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:17.440
games so much that I try to play as many games as possible. So I'm just never, I never have

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:22.320
that attention span to play, to finish a game. And I know it's a notorious joke on the show.

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:28.880
What bad gamer ADD I have that I never finish games. It's like, Ooh, sparkly. Go that, go

02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:34.620
here. But there was one game that came out this year that said, sit down and fucking

02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:42.400
play me till I'm finished. Just dance ABBA. That was the best 30 minutes of my life. Contemplated

02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:49.200
no, no, it's not just dance ABBA. Shut up. Uh, you can't beat just dance ABBA. Uh, but

02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:55.020
I have, I was absolutely sucked into this game start to finish. And it's just, it's

02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:59.520
an amazing fucking video game. And it's, it's the best video game of the year. It's portal

02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:04.080
to absolutely without question is best video game of the year. And it's, it's, it's everything

02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:09.160
these two said. And I will emphasize the fact that this game probably still would have been

02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:12.260
the game of the year without the co-op or the shit that they're, they've been adding

02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:16.520
to it since then. Haven't even touched COVID. Same. I haven't, I did play a little bit of

02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:20.480
the co-op. I beat co-op. I play a little bit of it and it's like, you know, that just further

02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:26.080
enhanced the experience of what was already an amazing game. And you know, the story was,

02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:31.960
was great. And I have to admit the first game I L I liked, but I didn't like love like dark

02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:36.720
soccer did or something. But this game, I think as Alan said a minute ago, made the

02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:42.840
first game that much better. It was so good. So, um, absolutely. Portal twos, my game of

02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:48.840
the year. So interesting that all three of us picked the same game in portal one, 90%

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:52.920
of the story happened in the last, what, two levels of it. And the story up until then

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.880
you could read the signs and a lot of it was really implied. And then at the end, the finale,

02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:01.260
when you're doing the big escape, that's where you figure out, Oh, okay. Portal two just

02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:04.120
hits the ground running. You already know what the story is and it just keeps getting

02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:07.800
better and better and better and better. Oh yeah. Uh, this is what you wanted me to play

02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:13.240
dark soccer here. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, you made it to one of the human habitats.

02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:19.560
We're looking for an artifact. Think of it as an archeological dig. Their laughter centered

02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:28.080
around one of the objects in this room. That's it. Scan it for me. So this cat loves lasagna

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:34.200
so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house. Oh, apparently it's not the cat's

02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:44.840
house or his lasagna. Oh, good. The man who owns the lasagna is furious. The end. The

02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:51.360
end. That's not funny. Do either of you feel like laughing? All right. I'm pulling you

02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:59.460
out. Welcome back. While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon. It's up on the screen.

02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:04.120
As you can see in my version, the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped

02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:09.600
with deadly neurotoxin dispensers. That which point the cat reflects on the time he ate

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:18.600
all of the man's lasagna and feels remorse briefly. Reactions. Yes. It's funny because

02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:25.240
most of it actually happened. Do you feel more human? Well, let's do some tests and

02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:31.400
see what happens. Nice. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, I was telling the chat room earlier,

02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:36.600
but Dan and I were at Disneyland in line for space mountain going and the best of space.

02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:43.240
Space. Yeah. I, I, I, again, I stand by what we said earlier. We did not compare lists.

02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:46.920
So I had no idea that, well, I kind of knew dark soccer will go for portal two is number

02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:49.480
one. Like, you know, I just, there was no question. I didn't know Alan was going to

02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:54.080
go there too. So, um, very, very interesting that we all picked the same game. I would

02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.000
say for the first time in 10 years, I think we've all picked the same game, but hold on.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.320
Loki's not here. And I kind of don't think Loki's going to go that way. He'd go saints.

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:08.220
I think that's on a four. Well, that didn't come out this year. I think that was his game

02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:12.040
last year. I think he's going to go saints row the third, which admittedly I thought

02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:17.000
you, I thought it was going to be, Oh, I, it was so fucking, how is Skyrim not on my

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:23.480
list? How, how is Skyrim not on my list? It wasn't, it was that good of a year for games.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:27.160
I mean, sky or Skyrim absolutely should be in my top three. I'm kind of don't care about

02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:33.460
Skyrim, but you, you, you're not really into those types of games though. I wouldn't expect

02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:39.000
you to like Skyrim yet. All this, all the crap that people do in Skyrim, I tried to

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.560
do and wow, 50,000 cheese wheels off the side of the mountain, but I tried to like climb

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:48.180
every mountain and try to get to places that no one can get to. And, but no, I will admit

02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:53.040
for quite some time, uh, saints row the third, just because of the fact, just the fun factor

02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:59.200
part of it, like that I have not laughed that fucking hard at a video game. Well, except

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:02.080
maybe portal two. No, I don't even think, I don't think portal two, I laughed as hard

02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:06.320
as I did as saints row the third. I mean, it's just that fucking good, but it's just,

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:11.600
I look back and I go, your three favorites got to make a commitment. And I think Mario

02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:18.720
edges it out slightly combustible lemons. So there you go. That was the part that cracked

02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:24.920
me up to no end. I think we'll be able to say portal two is going to end up the official

02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:29.380
OLR game of the year, just looking at the, uh, uh, feedback and so forth. But I, I Loki

02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:32.720
needs to have his say, so we'll get his input next week on what he thinks the top three

02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:37.200
games of the year are. Any guesses for Loki games? I mean, I think we have all said saints

02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:42.040
row. The third will probably be his number one, but what else for Loki games? Skylanders.

02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:45.840
I think he'll put Skyrim on there too. I think he'll, I think he'll put, I think he's going

02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:52.360
to put, what's that battlefield game. He loves battlefield three. No, not battlefield. What

02:29:52.360 --> 02:30:00.600
am I saying? Like actual battlefield. No. Um, the 1840 or 1940 whatever that he plays

02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:06.280
with the ants. Oh, modern war. But they play call of duty modern warfare two right now.

02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:12.680
Oh, I don't know. So we'll, we'll see. I just not Loki loves sandbox games. He loves sandbox

02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:16.000
games more than anything. So that's why I think it's going to be Skyrim and saints are

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.800
three saints row the third for sure. Yeah. But I don't know what else is going to have

02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:23.160
room in there. He'll kind of just say, ah, he'll, he'll just pull it out of his butt.

02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:27.040
He might go with portal two for like number three. I think he really did enjoy that. So

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:32.640
we'll see. Only Loki knows. So he'll be back next week. Trismo five this year. No, I don't

02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:38.440
think he'd go for that anyway. So I'm thinking more Dan something if, if he could fuck around

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:42.780
with it and hack it and stuff, that's the type of stuff he likes. I think his list will

02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:49.460
be portal to Skyrim and saints row the third, but we'll see. All right. I found you something

02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:55.400
else to play. You must play it. Oh, act deaf. And I think this is what you were thinking

02:30:55.400 --> 02:31:00.360
of earth defense force. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Thank you. Good. Good call. Act deaf. Absolutely.

02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:04.520
Earth defense force will probably be in there. Okay. There's the last thing. It's short.

02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:08.480
Okay. Oh, what? Oh, you sent me to play. All right. One more thing. All right. Because

02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:15.040
we love portal so much. All right. Make this quick. I am a whore for portal. Yes. And that

02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:20.120
made me a hortil. That is earth defense force. Insect Armageddon. Yeah. He'd probably put

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:25.160
that on this list. All right. Here we go. I've been thinking when life gives you lemons

02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:31.840
don't make lemonade. Make life. Take the lemons back. Get mad. I don't want your damn lemons.

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:37.120
What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rule the

02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:43.160
day it thought it could give cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the man

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:48.800
who's going to burn your house down with the lemons. I'm going to get my engineers to invent

02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:56.800
a combustible lemon that burns your house down. Burning people. He says what we're all

02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:01.760
thinking. All right. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't have the one that had got us on there cause

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:06.560
her comments make it extra funny. All right. So there it is. Our game of the year discussion.

02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:11.520
Hope you guys enjoyed or if you didn't, well, you're welcome to your own opinion. No. Well,

02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:16.220
we got your plenty of your opinions, uh, on the, I was surprised that only one person

02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:21.680
said Skyrim. I just, you know, when 72 media outlets say it, I'm kind of surprised, but

02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:25.000
I think maybe for a lot of people, it's one of those games where it's like Skyrim. It's

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.280
up there, but it just, it just didn't crack the top three. I was limited by the fact that

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:33.600
I play games two to three years late. And the fact that I'm playing Skyrim when it's

02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:38.560
only three years old is actually kind of amazing. And it's thanks to you getting three months

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:43.040
old. Thanks to you getting it for me when it was cheap. All right. All right. Let's

02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:46.760
move on. Uh, more gaming news for you guys. We've got the mailbag FUs of the week and

02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:50.960
of course your phone calls coming up in just a little bit. Um, so let's go to Alan with

02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:58.880
some more news. So there's been a lot of wank going on, uh, lately due to a feisty, um,

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:05.000
valve employee who was seen at an event wearing a half life. It's the half life lambda circle

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:11.240
logo with a three on it. And people saw that and were like, Ooh, half life three is coming.

02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:16.800
Um, I'm a huge half life fan. And for those listening who don't remember half life to

02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:24.080
proper came out in 2004, um, nearly 10 years ago and half life to episode two came out

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:28.360
in the orange box, which I believe when it, that was what, September of seven when portal

02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:34.560
one came out. Yeah. So that's pushing, um, four or five years now. So people are like

02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:41.080
valve, what is going on with half life three or at least half life to episode three. Thanks

02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:47.200
to this t-shirt people thought, um, it's, it's coming. Like this is, this is a tease.

02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:54.520
Um, ultimately, uh, Chet Falisek, who is a writer for half life and left for dead. And

02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:59.720
he also occasionally hits up the official forums has said that all of the rumors that

02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:04.240
the half life community on the official forums has sort of dredged out and saying that valve

02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:09.240
is working up to something. There's an, there's an alternate reality game similar to what

02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:14.200
portal two had when they updated the ending to portal one, where you call into like modems

02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:19.920
and you download all of these images, all the, the portal two stuff, it's all trolling.

02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:25.080
It's all trolling by half life fans like myself, just trolling the shadow of each other. Um,

02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:30.320
there's no official ARG or if there is, of course it's, it's one of those sort of, you

02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:36.600
can kind of see through the, the subtext of his response saying, uh, you know, uh, this

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.720
is his official response. You, you are being trolled. There is no ARG Wheatley speech was

02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:46.120
set in portal two fiction. That is all. There has been no directive from Gabe to leak anything.

02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:51.800
That is all false. So I would imagine there is something to leak, but you know, it's,

02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:57.560
it's all under lock and key by valve. I'm finishing his quote. I just want to say, I

02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:02.080
just want to say this. So there is no confusion. This is the community trolling the community.

02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:06.080
Nothing more while it is nice to see people excited about anything half life. I hate seeing

02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:11.480
people be trolled like this. Thanks. So what we get out of this story is valve is still

02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:16.440
committed to half life. It's still going to take them a couple of years to put out any

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.880
sequel. They haven't canceled. Obviously it's their bread and butter. It's the reason why

02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:23.820
valve is the company is it is, but all of this stuff that we're seeing right now to

02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:28.920
do that employee with his t-shirt, it's all just trolling. They aren't, they aren't ready.

02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:34.720
How does that make you feel as a half life fan? Oh, frustrated. But you kind of knew,

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.920
right? The minute you saw the shirt, I think you even said to me, somebody's just trolling

02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:44.380
better than he came out and said it. Yeah, that's true. Just leaving it to speculation.

02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:49.600
Even if he did get disciplined for it, it probably, you know, it's not a fireable offense

02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:54.240
for him to make a custom t-shirt that he knew was going to get the fandom to, you know,

02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:58.740
lose their minds. And even if he did get in trouble for it, we're not, we're not privy

02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:03.780
to that information. It's none of our business. And plus how could valve not be doing half

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:07.480
life three eventually, you know, like you said, it's their bread and butter and it's

02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:12.560
like, it's just, they probably just keep going back and changing stuff. I don't know. I kind

02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.960
of think it's coming soon. They're like, what else is left for valve to do? Unless it's

02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:22.360
well, they're doing defense defense, defense of the ancients. That's in beta. Now defense

02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:27.320
is going to be out before he three. So what's valve got to talk about at E3 this year? Left

02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:32.580
for dead three. Well, I shouldn't say that cause I mean, it's not like left for dead

02:36:32.580 --> 02:36:36.440
is a bad franchise. Or if they came out and said portal three, I think we'd all blow a

02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:41.360
load. You know, that would be great. But maybe it's a little too soon for portal three. You

02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:46.840
know, I would, even though I'm not as into half life as you, I'm kind of like, okay,

02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:51.400
give the half life fan, throw them a fucking bone. Let this be their year. 2012 is the

02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.680
end of the world after all. Let them have their goddamn half life. It was six years

02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:00.640
between one and two and it's now it's eight between two and conceivably three if they

02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:04.200
would say anything about it. So it's just like, we know that you're working on it. We

02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:08.640
just want throw us a bone. And they're like, no, we're not ready. They're like blizzard.

02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:11.720
They're not going to tell a shit. And this is all just trolling that's going on right

02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:18.160
now. All right. At least you'll have defense of the ancients to hold you over. No one curve.

02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:23.540
All right. Uh, moving on to what I find to be kind of an interesting thing that happened.

02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:28.960
This has to do with the game fallout new Vegas. And I guess what happened is that the lead

02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:37.360
designer behind fallout new Vegas actually released a mod to go with the game. Uh, it's

02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:41.240
not an official patch because, and of course now the source story isn't loading for me,

02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:46.560
but I read it earlier and the official patch, uh, or they didn't want to officially patch

02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:50.880
it because it was changing the games in ways that they may not want to subject everybody

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:56.720
to in terms of balancing and so on. So I think it's interesting that they, uh, kind of did

02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:59.560
it this way without doing an official mod. There we go. Now the story is loaded for me

02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:08.040
here. Um, you can download this mod direct from lead designer J E Sawyer and his website

02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:16.500
is Diogenes dash lamp dot info slash J Sawyer underscore FNV underscore mod.zip. But yeah,

02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:22.560
it's for fallout new Vegas. It will, uh, turn up the difficulty, uh, putting it up there

02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:27.120
to what he wanted in terms of difficulty. Hence part of the reasons why they don't want

02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:31.000
to put it out there for everybody. And he also just kind of said, you know what, the

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.120
game's over, the ship sailed, nobody's working on it anymore. There's no testers, there's

02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:38.800
nothing. This is just me doing what I want to do in my free time. So fallout new Vegas

02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:43.680
is done. So hold out hope for fallout four, I suppose, which would, I would think going

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:47.740
to be their next game. Now that Skyrim is out there, I'll let new Vegas is pretty, pretty

02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:53.720
good. I have to say. Yeah. So there you go. There is by the way, an ultimate edition of

02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:58.320
fallout new Vegas coming out on February 7th. That's, but that's just all the DLC from fallout

02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:03.640
new Vegas originally all put together in one little package there. All righty, let's go

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:11.640
to the mailbag. Yes. Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge trader

02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:16.400
dot com and dark soccer threatens to not read them, but then we beat her until she does

02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:22.120
beat, beat, beat that bat, bat, bat, bat. Okay. I'm going to treat you like a Justin

02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:30.600
Bieber pinata. Those things were hideous. Just some paper plates and party hats stapled

02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:36.080
together. Okay. So the first email comes from Robert M. Somehow I get the feeling that Jamie

02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:39.760
if she's in studio tonight has already seen this. What were you anticipating when I was

02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:46.960
definitely not being here, but I mean I wasn't really seriously thinking of calling in. Okay.

02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:50.280
If so, please post this link to the chat room and stop reading this now. Otherwise here's

02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:55.760
a pro toy, a customizer's version of the metal slug tank. Best of luck in the year ahead.

02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:01.080
And yeah, I, um, I did see this and I will post it in the chat room and if Rama will

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:07.160
be so kind as to, uh, put this picture and the link to the article on, uh, our tumble

02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:14.960
bubble. That's a little Lego. It's a Lego. It's cute. Uh, metal slug. Yeah. So I will

02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:21.720
post this in the chat room now. You know, also this music makes me kind of wish I was

02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:29.720
going on the Matterhorn cause it's kind of the same. Anyway, so this is comes from Holly

02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:33.120
D. Hey guys, I just wanted to share something that popped into my head when I heard about

02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:37.320
the poor guys on your show who have had their Xbox live impose screwed with, particularly

02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:40.880
the guy who said he gave them information to investigate and then they said his credentials

02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:45.360
weren't right even though they hadn't changed since he opened the case. We had a similar

02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:49.100
experience with Comcast over my internet bill except it wasn't a hacking. It was customer

02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:54.000
service fail. I switched to internet and cable from internet service. Well, next time I called

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.760
to check the installation time was from my number. I gave it and they told me I was wrong.

02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:01.800
I was like WTF. The first one pretty much hung up on me. So I called back again. This

02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:05.000
woman told me she could not access the account with me even though I was calling about an

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.220
appointment I obviously knew already. I argued with this woman for an hour and she finally

02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:12.640
found that my account had been closed and then the guy who set up the new service opened

02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:16.720
a new one and put in some bs number. So I had to reopen the old account, but she kept

02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:20.840
insisting that I had to go physically to one of their locations to fix it. I said like

02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:24.640
hell I was and I pointed out to her that if they weren't allowed to change the number,

02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:28.240
then who the hell gave him permission to change it in the first place. So she should could

02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:32.080
clearly see it had changed. After that she put me on the phone with her supervisor who

02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:37.540
fixed it. Took about two hours total. The basic point of this is to say that is to say

02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:41.140
try to point out the flaws in their logic and demand who know who authorized changing

02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:44.640
the information. It gets results sometimes because you know if they're claiming they

02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:49.600
can't change it, then they sure as hell know who authorized the first change. I hope it

02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:55.600
helps and I hope they get their accounts back soon, Holly D. Yeah. You know what happened

02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:00.440
with Comcast with us? We were supposed to have everything fixed on Thursday and Dan

02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:05.760
the night before, Dan had a phone call, an automated phone call that said Thursday and

02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:09.520
Dan had taken Thursday off work. Well then he goes to check it in the morning and it

02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:17.520
said Friday when Dan had to be at work. So he called me. I told him to call his supervisor,

02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:23.280
but I was also you know seven in the morning and asleep. So I just want to say Comcast

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:29.120
automation, these automations and computers and stuff just leads to trouble. It's a problem.

02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:34.200
Fail is what it is. She had to talk to a human being to get anything done. Well, no, he Dan

02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:38.980
tried to talk to a human being and she wouldn't change it. Hey guys, it's Blade3 again. Just

02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:43.680
wanted to say sorry about my grammar a couple of weeks. I'm, I gave everyone a hard time.

02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:50.040
She gives everyone shit. But use a period after I go please. I was on a PSP 2000 semicolon

02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:56.000
and comma. That's wrong. By the way, I was wondering what studio equipment you use and

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:00.300
setting up a recording studio and I was curious that should have a you in it about your mics

02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:09.280
and whatnot. Please keep it IP I guess it is it up the awesome work. Well, it's not

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:13.240
as complicated as you think the setup. I know for a show that's been around as long as we

02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:17.100
have you think we'd have this fancy thing going on, but it's actually not that complicated.

02:43:17.100 --> 02:43:20.840
Our first board came off the eBay. Yeah, the first board came off of eBay. The board we're

02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:24.520
using right now. We did upgrade to a newer board some time ago and I'll tell you it's

02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:32.540
what's called a Euro rack. Yeah, it's by Beringer. You be one two two two fx Pro. There are pictures

02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:35.260
if you look at the new studio pictures or as long as you do.com you can see the mixing

02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:39.520
board sitting there in the background. It's really as simple as we have three microphones

02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:43.500
and they're all hodgepodge microphones. I'll take a picture and put it up right. I've got

02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:48.780
a RadioShack in my hand. Yeah, Loki's is from RadioShack dark soccer is a Beringer mic that

02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:52.580
I think she picked up when she picked up the board. Yeah, mine was donated by DDR Angel

02:43:52.580 --> 02:43:57.100
like eight years ago and it still works. She's like this is an expensive mic and I want you

02:43:57.100 --> 02:44:00.480
guys to have it and it still works. This is actually I bought this one because my old

02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:05.420
mic died. Well, the DDR Angel mic is also a backup mic because it is sold. We actually

02:44:05.420 --> 02:44:08.460
had another mic that broke and then you've got your courthouse one in the other room.

02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:12.020
Yeah, I know what that one's from. They all I think it's another RadioShack mic but they

02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:16.700
all it's like a newer RadioShack mic. Yeah, so they all plug into the board and then you

02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:21.340
know every mic that I've bought I've gotten at Guitar Center. Ah, and every mic I think

02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:25.740
I've got at RadioShack maybe one at Fry's but anyway they all plug into the board. We

02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:30.760
try to equalize things on the board. I realize our voices are not always equalized. We try

02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:37.020
best we can to adjust things on the fly but unfortunately sometimes some of my co-hosts

02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:42.540
especially Dark Soccer and Loki tend to be very quiet if they're in a bad mood. Ah, and

02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:48.920
then they get very excited. Loki's worse though. I can talk about him because he's not here.

02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:54.620
Loki's a lot worse. By the way, look at our website and our little photos at top. I just

02:44:54.620 --> 02:45:02.100
sent a picture of the computer and the soundboard. By themselves. And the computer was donated

02:45:02.100 --> 02:45:08.140
by the listeners. The monitor is from Dan's mom. It's okay when Dan's grandmom got a new

02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:13.760
computer we took the monitor. So that's one of our spare monitors. So it's just a simple

02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:18.580
flat screen monitor and the computer was donated by the listeners which was an awesome gesture.

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:23.020
That was when I had the DevaFit one episode and I stormed off the set because what had

02:45:23.020 --> 02:45:27.380
happened? I think the show just kind of died in the middle like we were having the computer

02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:32.100
didn't the sound card? Sound card went out and wrapped in the middle of the show. I think

02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:36.780
the graphic card went out too. And then somebody in chat just you know sometimes and they you

02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:41.040
know and the person apologized to me afterwards so I don't mean to like dig up this four year

02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:45.220
old drama but it was you know just unfortunately say the wrong thing at the wrong moment and

02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:53.060
I just fucking lost it. And you know it was a moment when Travis called me the next day

02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:59.120
to go that was the best thing that has ever happened on OLR. And Travis doesn't say nice

02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:05.380
things about OLR very often. But he called me to say Rob that was the best thing you

02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:11.880
ever did on OLR. But the listeners after hearing that actually pulled together and bought a

02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:17.920
new computer and we use it to this day. I was in studio Dark Sakura when the show computer

02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:21.940
before this one it was going to be my I think my second or third guest appearance on OLR

02:46:21.940 --> 02:46:30.100
was when we had just started dating where the old show computer died. It went to put

02:46:30.100 --> 02:46:35.540
old show. That's the that's the one that the fans put together for you. It was the old

02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:41.180
big one. Oh in this in the garage studio. No no no. It was that it was it. No we we've

02:46:41.180 --> 02:46:45.780
had this one since then. It must be something most of the laptop. This this one. This was

02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:50.660
the computer that we got at my house. Right. Then we had the blue one the white and blue

02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:56.220
one that was a fan donation. No no no. That was my donation. That was yours. That's right.

02:46:56.220 --> 02:47:00.300
But that's the one that crapped out on that show. Yeah. That caused me to lose it. No

02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:04.300
because it was five thirty and you were firing up the computer and getting everything ready

02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:09.860
and it just it would it died. It stopped. Oh yeah. Something happened right before we

02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:14.180
got it. No that was we were able to fix it. We were able to fix it. Something it was something

02:47:14.180 --> 02:47:17.660
we found out later on was like a setting or something was screwed up but we were able

02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:23.640
to fix it. But it just screwed the show that night. So. And yeah and also the this sound

02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:28.340
board that you guys have just goes into the line in on your sound card and then you guys

02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:34.300
use what audition for the yeah we use audition for the for the podcasting itself. Yeah. Yeah.

02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:38.140
The mixing board goes into the computer through the line in and then it's all recorded straight

02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:43.160
in Adobe Audition. I'll tell you the secret that a lot of people kind of wonder about

02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:48.520
is that how do we have the Skype and the music and everything all through the same sound

02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:52.440
like we you know it's sometimes it's kind of hard to do. You have to have a really nice

02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:56.540
sound card just get a nice sound card and we have a sound blaster card has to be capable

02:47:56.540 --> 02:48:02.220
of what you hear. Yes you need something that's called what you with the letter U here and

02:48:02.220 --> 02:48:06.780
the what you hear component on the sound card is what allows us to do Skype calls without

02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:13.700
call graph do you know just have everything plug into the external mixer. My old laptop

02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:20.220
had the capability except for that card it was actually listed as speaker output. So

02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:24.300
so yeah well different sound cards anything that came in you want to have it set to anything

02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:28.480
that's going to come out of the speaker. I think somebody explained it to me as you want

02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:32.860
a full duplex card and not a half duplex card because full duplex is what's capable in and

02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:37.140
out at the same time. Yes that's very important to spend if you're going to do podcast your

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:40.740
computer spend the extra money to get a nicer sound card and you'll be set. My nice awesome

02:48:40.740 --> 02:48:45.500
quad core computer doesn't have a sound card that does that but my old crappy laptop does.

02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:52.980
Yeah weird. So in the chat dark Tetsuya says oh I think he had that clip on under station

02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:58.620
live not too long after there's a clip. Oh Lord. Well I got it probably was all recorded

02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:03.020
on Justin T.V. because we were or did Justin T.V. go out when the rest of it went out.

02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:08.000
I remember we were using Justin T.V. I don't remember. I will because we were in the garage

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:13.940
studio when that happened. Yeah I think Justin T.V. was out but I don't remember. It was

02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:20.020
so long ago now I'm sure that clip will show up soon enough though. And Rama says it sound

02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:23.900
blaster autogy or better. That's what you're going to want out of a card. Anyway that's

02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:28.700
my very long winded memory lane answer to that short question. Well we have one last

02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:37.780
email. And actually it's from well I didn't I'm just gonna say from Nigel. Here's an article

02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:41.900
from the Guardian UK national newspaper. I read the Guardian all the time. So yeah that

02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:49.100
might interest one dark Sakura. And here it is playing video games makes me sick is what

02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:59.020
it's called. And from I scammed it over and I'll go ahead and read this bit of the paragraph.

02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:05.020
You know and he's talking about playing Modern Warfare 3. This is he says I'm insanely jealous

02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:08.460
because I can't play it. This isn't because I haven't got a necessary game console or

02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:12.580
don't like shooting people. I have and I do. After a mere 30 minutes of playing them I

02:50:12.580 --> 02:50:17.140
have to run to the bathroom to throw up. I'm not alone either. Where there is little research

02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:22.020
into video games and what has been called simulation sickness estimates suggest that

02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:26.880
between 10 percent and 50 percent of people may suffer to various degrees. For me it was

02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:33.140
triggered from the first time I played such a game the PlayStation classic Doom in 1995.

02:50:33.140 --> 02:50:38.540
And for me the pixel games don't do it to me that badly. You know like Doom. But if

02:50:38.540 --> 02:50:48.220
you the worst game that ever did it to me was Goldeneye on Nintendo 64. That game would

02:50:48.220 --> 02:50:53.980
make me so sick. I couldn't watch because Dan was playing through it at the time and

02:50:53.980 --> 02:51:00.200
he loves that game and I wanted to love it. I really did. Nope sick. I couldn't play unreal.

02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:06.620
I couldn't play the newer quakes because anything that was actually 3D would make me sick. Katamari

02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:12.660
made me super sick. Portal makes me way sick because it doesn't have that fast reorientation

02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:18.480
the way that Portal 2 does. So Portal 2 made me sick at first but I could get used to it.

02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:22.240
And now I can play it with no problem. I mean I do have to stop every few levels and let

02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:26.580
my eyes readjust. But I can't play the first Portal for very long at all because it will

02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:31.180
make me very nauseous. Technically you're supposed to do that with any game anyway every

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:35.000
you know 30 minutes or so. How many people do that Rob? Well I'm just saying you're supposed

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:38.940
to and there's a reason. Well I'm usually also multitasking. I'm talking to people while

02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:46.780
I'm playing Portal. So. But yeah. But basically it's just. Here's another thing. It says the

02:51:46.780 --> 02:51:51.260
US Army Research Institute for Behavioral Social Science also studied flight simulators

02:51:51.260 --> 02:51:55.820
and found that slightly fewer than half of pilots using them reported symptoms similar

02:51:55.820 --> 02:52:01.500
to motion sickness. So this is actually super cool and I would also. In fact I'm gonna link

02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:07.780
this in the chat room as well because I think that other people will benefit from this.

02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:14.660
Spazinator you can shut the fuck up. Spazinator by the way said want to play some Goldeneye.

02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:18.780
But to be fair he did put colon P which means he isn't serious. I know. All right. And I

02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:26.020
wasn't serious although. But yeah I just would get so sick. And I get a little motion sick

02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:35.180
in a car if I'm not driving. But yeah. All right. That it for emails. You know what.

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:43.180
I do not complain every other second. So AGN 728. Bite me. Bite me. That's not a complaint.

02:52:43.180 --> 02:52:46.460
That's a command. You should complain about the fact that they can't be bothered to change

02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:55.100
your nickname. Yeah. All right. Moving on. I wonder if that's for Angry Gaming Nerd maybe.

02:52:55.100 --> 02:52:58.940
But no it's somebody that's coming from all games radio all games network. They're in

02:52:58.940 --> 02:53:03.260
the all games chat as opposed to the chat that orange on radio. You didn't have to kick

02:53:03.260 --> 02:53:08.580
him. What you kick him for. I can handle my own back. I'm a grown woman. I can fight my

02:53:08.580 --> 02:53:13.780
own battles. Now look at that. Despite all that she's got your back. Despite all that

02:53:13.780 --> 02:53:18.340
she's done all that. You need to slap one with the trout right now to kick him myself.

02:53:18.340 --> 02:53:22.460
I mean no I'm kidding. I wouldn't have done that. I will. I'm a good girl. I will slap

02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:27.980
Rama with the trout for you. Thank you. There you go. All right. We need to. We actually

02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:32.780
I wish we could change that to like with large boobs or something. All right. Moving on.

02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:39.900
OK. We've got to move on. The week. Oh speaking of complaints. What a perfect time for us

02:53:39.900 --> 02:54:04.300
to do our normal segment of the. Um really my my complaint. Fuck you to moving because

02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:10.940
moving is awful. I mean I like being in the new house that isn't falling apart like my

02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:20.100
old house was. I hate paying rent now but I really like being in the new place and it's

02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:24.780
just the soreness and the pain that comes with all the moving and not really just the

02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:30.060
physical stuff but the emotional side of it too because I mean Dan and I lived at that

02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:35.980
old house. We got married living in that old house. We had lots of wonderful fights in

02:54:35.980 --> 02:54:43.100
that old house. We've done lots of other things in that house. Sure. He's pooped on it. You

02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:46.740
know how many. Sure. He hasn't pooped on this house yet. Prayed in that house is what you

02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:58.540
meant to say. Yeah. Rob I've prayed. I prayed a lot. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. No. But I mean

02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:03.140
there and on top of that that house before you know we rented from our friends and they

02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:07.380
got married in the backyard of that house. Oh wow. So I mean we have lots of memories

02:55:07.380 --> 02:55:14.260
of going over there to visit our friends too. You know a decade of memories of that house.

02:55:14.260 --> 02:55:18.540
So you know we're going to miss our neighbors. We told them where we love those. We literally

02:55:18.540 --> 02:55:24.620
moved three blocks away. But I have to add a thank you to Dan for this morning when he

02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:30.140
kind of woke me up when he was about to leave. He said you don't have to do anything today.

02:55:30.140 --> 02:55:37.460
You have my full blessing to stay in bed all day or play well all day if you want to. You

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:43.940
I will not expect a single tour out of you. So I got up and did the dishes. No I did the

02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:48.700
dishes when I got up because I just wanted my coffee cup. Chiggers and chat says that

02:55:48.700 --> 02:55:53.620
would suck moving all those pinball machines. Well Dan did all that. So we have we have

02:55:53.620 --> 02:56:00.220
this kind of Jack thing. It's got a big flat metal platform on top and you put it under

02:56:00.220 --> 02:56:07.340
the table and you jack it up like a car jack. He had the jacket. But you can it lifts the

02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:11.700
whole table up so that you can move it on this wheeled object so that in and of itself

02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:17.500
isn't isn't very heavy and you can raise it to the level of a truck and slide it in. Wow.

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:22.220
So that's the science that the refrigerator was harder to move because we had to take

02:56:22.220 --> 02:56:25.700
the doors off the house and the doors off the refrigerator to get the damn thing in.

02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:34.700
All right. We got to move on with the. OK. All right. Alan. Oh boy. It's a new year.

02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:41.620
It's when people set arbitrary expectations on life changes you know resolutions and I'm

02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:46.220
like really fat right now. So if you've been really out of shape and waiting the most I've

02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:55.380
ever waited my life. I blame happiness. It's relationship weight. Yeah I'm so miserable.

02:56:55.380 --> 02:57:00.860
No speak being unemployed and you know it's apparently done wonders for my appetite that

02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:06.980
I don't need. So I just need to lose weight. That happened though when I first moved out

02:57:06.980 --> 02:57:12.420
here and moved in with Dan. I went from a size 12 which I don't care I've always had

02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:21.300
some but to me to a 24. So I think Rob's accurate. I mean it happens when you're not working

02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:28.500
relationship with a lot of stuff involved. And you're certainly not a size 24 anymore.

02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:36.860
No I lost 60 pounds. Yeah. All right. So and when I was helping do like volunteer crew

02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:43.060
for room loud the rock band fundraiser. It's fine now but for like a day or two after for

02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:47.460
a good two weeks my right knee was hurting because I guess I picked something up wrong

02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:52.100
better than my back which is injured. But it's OK now. And it's like I mean you're getting

02:57:52.100 --> 02:57:57.860
old with stuff up means you're out of shape and you know getting old. So just being out

02:57:57.860 --> 02:58:04.380
of shape and overweight. My view of the week. I don't know I don't really have a lot because

02:58:04.380 --> 02:58:08.980
shit I'm on vacation right now and I I have an extra week off. I don't have to go back

02:58:08.980 --> 02:58:13.460
tomorrow like most people do. So and I'm going to Disneyland. Shit life's pretty fucking

02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:18.500
good right now. So if you do the fact that it all has to end sometime if you're not taking

02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:27.940
me. Well if you do you for for not being taken. I don't know. All right. Heart heart heart.

02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:31.020
That's it. That's it for the if he's the week. All right. Just a couple more stories for

02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:34.460
you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line and take your Twitter topics. I

02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:37.940
don't think we have a lot of Twitter Twitter topics yet but we'll see Twitter dot com slash

02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:44.820
O L R. But first just a couple quick stories for you guys. Alan. Team meet to make the

02:58:44.820 --> 02:58:51.180
amazing sort of God. I know right. So you see act deaf in chat. Yeah. That you took

02:58:51.180 --> 02:58:58.080
an arrow to the knee. Yes. And I have I have a sneeze on deck so I'm going to try and burn

02:58:58.080 --> 02:59:02.760
through this story. Team meet released a game called the Binding of Isaac and it's the same

02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:10.140
art as Super Meat Boy which is a great retro game that made a lot of top 10 lists for this

02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:15.740
year. The Binding of Isaac it's currently available on PC via steam. They're in talks

02:59:15.740 --> 02:59:23.180
to bring it to the 3DS via their 3DS app store. And you were just playing VVVVV on the 3DS

02:59:23.180 --> 02:59:27.860
different developer but it's still a steam indie game now available on a handheld. And

02:59:27.860 --> 02:59:33.020
so yeah. Team Meat is trying to bring the Binding of Isaac which I guess is a roguelike

02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:40.660
dungeon crawler game has some biblical story points to it. And apparently it's really awesome

02:59:40.660 --> 02:59:44.620
kind of gross. But Super Meat Boy was kind of gross too has the same art style. Look

02:59:44.620 --> 02:59:50.020
for it on the 3DS. Maybe they're in talks and that is interesting. Very interesting.

02:59:50.020 --> 02:59:52.540
I kind of like where that's going if a lot of those indie games are suddenly going to

02:59:52.540 --> 02:59:57.820
show up on 3DS. They wanted to bring Super Meat Boy to the Wii but the limitations on

02:59:57.820 --> 03:00:03.700
the patching and how big I think the max file size could be. They couldn't do it so the

03:00:03.700 --> 03:00:07.300
fact that they're still talking to Nintendo trying to get their next game after Super

03:00:07.300 --> 03:00:18.500
Meat Boy 2 the 3DS is a great sign. Awesome. Yeah. Alright. And lastly tonight a story

03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:24.180
that is kind of one of those things you sort of saw coming. Online passes it's all the

03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:28.740
rage in the industry right? It's happening on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. If you want

03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:32.580
to play a game online and you didn't buy it new you're going to have to buy an extra

03:00:32.580 --> 03:00:37.300
little pass. Well guess what? It's coming to the Playstation Vita as well. Yes it was

03:00:37.300 --> 03:00:43.660
confirmed that Hot Shots Golf World Invitational it requires an online pass. New copies have

03:00:43.660 --> 03:00:47.660
a code that comes with it but an online pass is purchased through the Playstation Network

03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:52.560
if you have a used or a downloaded copy. Now this was amended later on because I guess

03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:56.300
at first they were like oh shit if you download it you have to get the online pass as well

03:00:56.300 --> 03:01:01.540
but it actually was updated to say that hold on the online pass is actually already included

03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:05.780
when you download it on Playstation Network so you don't have to download it separately

03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:12.540
just to be fair. So the online passes though they are going over to the PS Vita. Now the

03:01:12.540 --> 03:01:20.680
online pass will cost 900 yen for Hot Shots Golf that's about $11.50 US so you can expect

03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:30.180
$10 probably to be about the same price here in the US. So well I guess it's probably not

03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:36.820
surprising to hear right? Yeah alright. Let's go to the phones. We're going to open up the

03:01:36.820 --> 03:01:42.740
phones right now. I'm sorry I was doing my hair. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype

03:01:42.740 --> 03:01:47.100
is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to go to the Twitter topics real quick and read some

03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:51.900
of the stories and things you guys want to talk about. Not a whole lot of feedback this

03:01:51.900 --> 03:01:58.740
week. Didn't get a lot through the week probably because of the holidays but let's see. Redertainment

03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:04.180
tweeted us saying voting is live for the 4th annual the 4 star awards. Well I don't know

03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:09.540
what is that? Is that like your own personal? What is the 4 star awards? I don't know. And

03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:16.340
we're not nominated. Granted there's no podcast category but we should be nominated for movie

03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:26.100
of the year. Whatever it's on Facebook if you want to check it out. Alright. We'll pimp

03:02:26.100 --> 03:02:32.180
out any awards show what the hell. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:02:32.180 --> 03:02:35.940
Tigerclaw sent us a couple quick tweets here. I read about one of these earlier. He sent

03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:40.580
us a tweet about dude turned swap note into an RPG. I have to admit I didn't pick this

03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:45.620
story for tonight because I wasn't sure how to explain it. It's a YouTube it's 9 minutes

03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:49.100
long so I'm not going to play the entire YouTube for you guys but some guy if you don't know

03:02:49.100 --> 03:02:55.240
what swap note is it came out on the 3DS this week. It's a system that lets you basically

03:02:55.240 --> 03:03:00.060
exchange emails except instead of written emails they're little actual written handwritten

03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:03.820
notes that you can send to other people but as you use swap note more you can start to

03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:08.500
send 5 second messages or pictures. I actually sent to all the people on my friends list

03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:13.780
on 3DS I sent a picture of Maruko one of the cats here and sent it out. So you know it's

03:03:13.780 --> 03:03:17.340
kind of like a fun way to share things. It's like oh wow Nintendo is actually embracing

03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:21.720
the internet for something. Well somebody actually turned it into a full fledged RPG

03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:25.460
in the vein of Dungeons and Dragons. And I guess there's even like a Dungeon Master template

03:03:25.460 --> 03:03:29.660
you can use and he talks about all this in his YouTube on how he did it. Again it's a

03:03:29.660 --> 03:03:34.740
little long for me to play here but it's MNC Dover is the username on YouTube if you want

03:03:34.740 --> 03:03:41.400
to look that up for yourself. Alright and one other tweet here from Tigerclaw. Epic

03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:49.620
Games scores a victory against Silicon Knights in a Two Human suit. And I don't even remember

03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:52.620
what this suit was all about so I'm loading the story now. He's linked us to a story at

03:03:52.620 --> 03:04:00.300
the multiplayer blog at MTV.com. And let's see. Two Human was supposed to be the start

03:04:00.300 --> 03:04:04.480
of the next great expansive RPG franchise and reasons that gamers will want in Xbox

03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:09.980
360 back in the early days. The Silicon Knights developed game was supposed to be a big deal

03:04:09.980 --> 03:04:14.980
but the game was delayed for two years. The critical response to the game was less enthusiastic

03:04:14.980 --> 03:04:19.900
and what was intended to be a trilogy was Dead on Arrival with just 130,000 units sold

03:04:19.900 --> 03:04:25.260
and Microsoft ending their agreement with Silicon Knights. I guess Silicon sued Epic

03:04:25.260 --> 03:04:31.060
Games over Two Human saying that Epic misrepresented the functionality of the Unreal Engine which

03:04:31.060 --> 03:04:36.980
was used for Two Human resulting in the two year delay. Wow interesting. Well the case

03:04:36.980 --> 03:04:42.540
against Epic Games took a blow because one of the key witnesses was excluded from giving

03:04:42.540 --> 03:04:48.060
testimony after a ruling by Judge James Denver the third. The testimony was going to break

03:04:48.060 --> 03:04:53.420
it down into dollars and cents terms what the negative impact of working with the Unreal

03:04:53.420 --> 03:04:58.040
Engine was supposed to have on Silicon Knights but the testimony was found to be questionable

03:04:58.040 --> 03:05:02.420
and that the methods did not fit the facts of the case. Interesting. I didn't realize

03:05:02.420 --> 03:05:05.820
there was all this drama going on. Of course this was a game that wasn't on my radar and

03:05:05.820 --> 03:05:08.820
maybe the fact that it wasn't on my radars you know part of the reason why I didn't sell

03:05:08.820 --> 03:05:13.900
so good but there you go. Alright anyhow let's go to the phones and take some calls. Hi you're

03:05:13.900 --> 03:05:23.020
on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Oh hey you don't sound so good try again. Who's this?

03:05:23.020 --> 03:05:29.580
Is it just me that doesn't hear that at all? It's really. You sound like a Dalek. I can't.

03:05:29.580 --> 03:05:33.940
I'm hoping oh god I hope that's it was Zaku obviously that was calling in he might have

03:05:33.940 --> 03:05:38.420
been able to make that out but I can't I couldn't understand him at all. No neither could I.

03:05:38.420 --> 03:05:41.820
Now was that his connection or was that ours? See now all these things I'm going to question

03:05:41.820 --> 03:05:48.480
is that the new studio set up so let me just see real quick here. Real quick here. Hello

03:05:48.480 --> 03:05:52.860
welcome to Skype call testing service. See that works fine. Hello British lady. Hello

03:05:52.860 --> 03:05:56.140
British lady. Let's see if maybe this next call sounds a little cleaner. Hi you're on

03:05:56.140 --> 03:06:02.660
Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hello Derek H. Hi Derek H. See I can understand Derek

03:06:02.660 --> 03:06:08.860
just fine. Our last call was a little weird. Alright anyhow Derek what's on your mind buddy?

03:06:08.860 --> 03:06:13.660
I would like to talk about video games I've called you guys too. There's this thing called

03:06:13.660 --> 03:06:17.500
Steam I don't know if you've heard of it that they have like a. Oh a friend was telling

03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:22.220
me about Steam. We don't play games. I play board games. We sure eat a lot of food though.

03:06:22.220 --> 03:06:27.740
Would you like to play some Risk or maybe Axis and Allies? I was thinking more about

03:06:27.740 --> 03:06:36.460
Wits and Wagers maybe. So Steam yes yes I've heard of Steam. I've had Steam for a long

03:06:36.460 --> 03:06:45.820
time and I only buy games when they're like. Whoa whoa whoa Derek you cut out if you can

03:06:45.820 --> 03:06:53.060
hear me you like totally cut out. It sounds like what the hell's going on? It's like the

03:06:53.060 --> 03:07:04.700
void of calls. Your voice like dropped out so did your mic come unplugged or something?

03:07:04.700 --> 03:07:08.100
Hello trying Derek again one two three. I see that we're still connected it's not an

03:07:08.100 --> 03:07:13.500
internet thing but he just the voice dropped out. I don't even know if he can hear us.

03:07:13.500 --> 03:07:19.340
He hung up. That's a bummer. I don't even know what he was about to say about Steam

03:07:19.340 --> 03:07:23.180
but I think it was like I only buy games when and I'm thinking it was maybe when they're

03:07:23.180 --> 03:07:27.960
on sale. Yeah dirt cheap maybe. Maybe it was going to lead to a question about is that

03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:31.740
bad that for the industry? I don't know let's see. I just want to make sure here real quick

03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:38.220
let's just let's just maybe this studio is a bad omen for calls. Let's see. Hello welcome

03:07:38.220 --> 03:07:43.380
to Skype call testing service. She works fine. After the beep please record a message. Afterwards

03:07:43.380 --> 03:07:48.860
your message will be played back to you. Hi I'm doing really professional internet radio

03:07:48.860 --> 03:07:56.360
right now and I am testing a Skype connection live. I love you British lady. On the air.

03:07:56.360 --> 03:08:01.100
This is all dark soccer's fault. Hi I'm doing really professional internet radio right now

03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:11.340
and I am. See it's fine. What's up. You know what's up is this delicious stew. It's amazing.

03:08:11.340 --> 03:08:16.140
Thank you so much. Pop is just put in front of my mouth begging me to eat. What is what

03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:25.240
did you make here. It's just stew cubed stew beef small red potatoes carrots and I actually

03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:30.500
cut up two blood oranges and threw them in there and I can taste this I can taste it

03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:37.140
too. Yeah I used a peeler to get the rind the orange zest. All right. So it's it's Orange

03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:47.860
Lounge do do. Oh my God we're breaking up. I've had that in my head like all night. All

03:08:47.860 --> 03:08:53.260
right let's move on to another call. Maybe this one will work. Hi you're on orange already.

03:08:53.260 --> 03:08:57.940
Who's this. It's Shane. OK. So far we can hear you and you're not a robot. So that's

03:08:57.940 --> 03:09:03.020
good. Hi Shane. Awesome. I'm not a robot. That's cool. What's on your mind Shane. I

03:09:03.020 --> 03:09:09.180
don't know. I was calling to see if your stuff would work. Pretty much. Well only the collar

03:09:09.180 --> 03:09:16.340
appears to be broken this time. You need to come play with me on the Horde server. Oh

03:09:16.340 --> 03:09:20.480
but there's so much Star Wars going on right now. All right. You know what. Pooh on that.

03:09:20.480 --> 03:09:23.980
Then let's talk Star Wars. Because you were just telling me earlier you do nothing but

03:09:23.980 --> 03:09:28.560
play Star Wars now. Yeah it's really sad. I came on here and I said you know I like

03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:32.900
Star Wars and I don't like Star Wars for these particular reasons. So what are your

03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:36.740
thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic. Well first of all I'd like to say I did not listen

03:09:36.740 --> 03:09:40.380
to what you said about why you like it and why you do not. So I don't know if I'm going

03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:47.500
to copy you or anything but I like it because the story is really cool and I don't know

03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:54.620
anything about Star Wars so this is all new to me. Like every single last thing. OK I'm

03:09:54.620 --> 03:09:57.900
still there I hear like stuff in the background. Yeah we're just eating we're stuffing our

03:09:57.900 --> 03:10:04.140
face while you're talking. Oh that's what I was eating long questions. That wasn't a

03:10:04.140 --> 03:10:11.300
very long question. All right. I don't like it because it doesn't feel polished still

03:10:11.300 --> 03:10:16.900
which is expected because it's such a new game. But you know that will come with time.

03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:21.300
Wow wasn't that great at vanilla. I played it a little bit but I'm really digging it

03:10:21.300 --> 03:10:27.280
like there's plot twists and every single class so far has been really fun to play which

03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:32.180
I can't say the same for well but I do love well I'm in a year commitment with wow I have

03:10:32.180 --> 03:10:35.860
like fully paid off with time card so I don't really care if I'm not playing it right now

03:10:35.860 --> 03:10:42.140
so but I'm really enjoying Star Wars I just got a ship on one of my characters and it's

03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:59.780
pretty cool. I mean. So describe the glasses for us. Oh my God you pigs. OK. There's dinner.

03:10:59.780 --> 03:11:03.260
Well that's what I was doing and then I thought I would call it help to make sure your Skype

03:11:03.260 --> 03:11:08.060
was working. Why wait no no no hold on. I got another question for you. OK. OK. My question

03:11:08.060 --> 03:11:12.940
is what is supposed to happen in the end game of Star Wars like I don't know because I can't

03:11:12.940 --> 03:11:17.960
even figure out the non end game yet. Like there's no hand holding for the most part

03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:23.260
except for at the very beginning. And so like I'm just kind of pretending I know what I'm

03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:30.180
doing and it's not working out so well in some situations like some quests I kind of

03:11:30.180 --> 03:11:36.780
suck at but oh well I haven't seen but like maybe two level 50 characters and their armors

03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:42.460
ugly so I don't even care about endgame yet. I just want story. Something just occurred

03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:49.260
to me. What. We're sitting at a table eating. I know right. I know. Who does that anymore.

03:11:49.260 --> 03:11:55.360
So Shane have you had any problems with like leveling up crap like keeping your crafting

03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:59.180
up to level with what level you are and using the auction house because Rob I haven't played

03:11:59.180 --> 03:12:03.740
myself but Rob was saying that he has trouble with how auction house works. The auction

03:12:03.740 --> 03:12:08.000
house is pretty terrible auction house works like Final Fantasy 11 auction house in some

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:13.280
ways not only it's like a hybrid between 11 and wow it's weird. I don't really like it

03:12:13.280 --> 03:12:19.300
but the crafting funny enough I'm actually doing right now while I'm on this Skype stuff

03:12:19.300 --> 03:12:27.260
because I was not paying attention to it because part of the crafting aspect is that your companions

03:12:27.260 --> 03:12:32.920
do it and not you. So I have I now have two companions so I can kind of do two things

03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:39.640
at once but my companion that's like you know I can run around the world with and do stuff

03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:44.300
with and fight is my tank and I'm a healer so I kind of need him to not craft because

03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:51.620
he goes away when he crafts. So I'm just I'm leveling up the little thing that makes lightsaber

03:12:51.620 --> 03:12:58.820
crystals right now because it's really really far behind. I like it. I don't have characters

03:12:58.820 --> 03:13:05.260
later and do flash points. What was that? Sorry I'm eating a potato. Are we gonna get

03:13:05.260 --> 03:13:11.140
on later and do flash points? Yeah. Or just regular quests because we can only do one

03:13:11.140 --> 03:13:17.020
flash point until like 16 or 14 I forget. I thought you loved the flash points so much

03:13:17.020 --> 03:13:20.620
in Star Wars though. Why do you love flash points so much that's a good question to ask.

03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:27.220
Let me let me let me clarify that now because I've run a total of three. I like the starter

03:13:27.220 --> 03:13:35.060
flash points for both sides now. It's neat because you can completely change the outcome

03:13:35.060 --> 03:13:40.260
of that flash point story based on dialogue options. So all my characters for the most

03:13:40.260 --> 03:13:47.180
part are light side even though they might be Imperial or Republic. So like I save the

03:13:47.180 --> 03:13:51.660
captain from being killed. I save this general from being killed. I take this chick with

03:13:51.660 --> 03:13:59.060
me that the commander wants killed. So if my choice gets picked out of the random roles

03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:04.380
it affects the rest of the story for everybody for that specific flash point. So that's really

03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:10.740
neat to me and they don't feel that long even though I think they're like an hour long each.

03:14:10.740 --> 03:14:20.380
But I did just yesterday run a second flash point on my one of my characters I don't remember

03:14:20.380 --> 03:14:27.460
who and it was very dull because it was all brown. It was like playing Gears of War or

03:14:27.460 --> 03:14:33.380
any other FPS that's come out in the last couple years. Why do you say that just because

03:14:33.380 --> 03:14:40.140
it graphically didn't look good? It's because there was just it was all the same color palette

03:14:40.140 --> 03:14:44.620
and it was boring and I didn't even see all the story. See you only like pretty things.

03:14:44.620 --> 03:14:50.060
I what? You only like pretty things. Yeah. Oh okay as long as we're clear. Normal person

03:14:50.060 --> 03:14:55.460
would want something ugly. I don't know. That's why there's so many orphans. I ask myself

03:14:55.460 --> 03:15:06.860
a lot. Wow. I was gonna say I ask myself that a lot when I cry to myself to sleep at night.

03:15:06.860 --> 03:15:12.260
All right. Anyhow I should probably let you go soon so we can get other calls hopefully

03:15:12.260 --> 03:15:17.380
but do you have any other closing thoughts for us tonight Shane? I was going to participate

03:15:17.380 --> 03:15:22.020
in that top three games of the year thing on Facebook and then I got lazy and didn't

03:15:22.020 --> 03:15:27.020
type anything out. But Portal 2 would have been my number one as well after thinking

03:15:27.020 --> 03:15:30.660
about every single game that came out this year. Nothing else. I didn't sit through any

03:15:30.660 --> 03:15:35.220
other game from start to finish this year except for Portal. I think what I should have

03:15:35.220 --> 03:15:40.540
done is a top three most disappointing games of the year because there were a lot of hyped

03:15:40.540 --> 03:15:47.740
games that did not meet expectations. My number one would piss people off. My top three would

03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:52.420
probably make lots of people angry. Well you can make people angry because they can't send

03:15:52.420 --> 03:15:57.460
hate mail to you. So what's your top three most disappointing? I wouldn't put them in

03:15:57.460 --> 03:16:03.940
any sort of order because they were all very disappointing. I would say Dragon Age 2 because

03:16:03.940 --> 03:16:11.780
it just wasn't that good. I would also say Uncharted 3 because 2 was so good and Uncharted

03:16:11.780 --> 03:16:18.220
3 kind of dropped the ball. And then I would say Marvel vs Capcom 3. It's just not fun.

03:16:18.220 --> 03:16:23.940
I even have Ultimate and I like playing Phoenix Wright but it's still not a fun game. Dark

03:16:23.940 --> 03:16:34.620
Sakura? You said you like Strider, right? No, I like Phoenix Wright. Oh Phoenix Wright?

03:16:34.620 --> 03:16:43.220
Well he can be wrong. You can choke on a potato too. I agree with Dragon Age 2. I believe

03:16:43.220 --> 03:16:49.380
I've picked up every NPC that I can, I think. I just got off the mountain where Flemeth

03:16:49.380 --> 03:16:55.100
is there and you do the thing where Flemeth comes back. I don't care about the side characters

03:16:55.100 --> 03:17:02.140
like I did in Origins. Yeah, the story's just not as good. The combat's more fun. I own

03:17:02.140 --> 03:17:06.420
it on PC and PS3. That's how much I cared about Dragon Age 1. I was like, oh I love

03:17:06.420 --> 03:17:11.700
2, it's gonna be awesome. No. Yeah, I'm gonna beat it simply because I'm committed to the

03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:17.100
world that they've built but the writing isn't as good. No. Alright. Shane, I gotta let you

03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:22.340
go so we can get more calls. That's cool. Okay? I do. Alright, bye. Alright, we're gonna

03:17:22.340 --> 03:17:28.460
go to some more calls. Hooray! Let's try this again. Hi, on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's

03:17:28.460 --> 03:17:33.180
this? Hello, it's Derek H from Fardini Beach. Nice to hear from you again. I don't know

03:17:33.180 --> 03:17:38.220
what happened before. It's a weird internet thing. I blame Skype. Well it's free so you

03:17:38.220 --> 03:17:42.820
can't blame Skype but I still blame Skype. Alright, well you were talking about Steam

03:17:42.820 --> 03:17:47.580
and you were about to say, you were talking about I only buy games on Steam when... They're

03:17:47.580 --> 03:17:53.780
on sale and that is a huge mistake. I should only buy games on Steam. In fact, I'll say

03:17:53.780 --> 03:17:57.620
this about everybody. Everybody should only buy games on Steam when they are full price

03:17:57.620 --> 03:18:03.940
because then you know that you actually want that game because I have a, now after the

03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:11.740
last week I have like 8 games I'm never gonna play again. I bought 2 games. I bought, I

03:18:11.740 --> 03:18:17.660
looked and I said, oh wow, there's 2 flight sims for only $3 a piece and then I looked

03:18:17.660 --> 03:18:24.300
and I have a flight stick that had fallen behind my desk like a year ago and I never

03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:28.460
even bothered to reach it and so when I picked it up it had a layer of dust on it so I was

03:18:28.460 --> 03:18:33.700
like, oh wait, I have a flight stick. I must like flight sims. So I bought those games,

03:18:33.700 --> 03:18:37.660
played them for 20 minutes and realized I hate flight sims. Raise your hand if you've

03:18:37.660 --> 03:18:43.740
been there. Earlier this year, I think it was the Thanksgiving sale, they had Dead Space

03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:48.940
1 and 2 in a combo pack for like 4 or 5 bucks and I was like, alright, Dead Space, you know,

03:18:48.940 --> 03:18:52.980
Resident Evil with aliens or ghosts in outer space, I'll buy that. I had already bought

03:18:52.980 --> 03:18:58.140
it. Completely forgot that I had bought the rights to download that on my Steam. Same

03:18:58.140 --> 03:19:02.660
with Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition. It's like, oh yeah, dirt cheap 3 bucks. I

03:19:02.660 --> 03:19:05.820
get my credit card out. Oh yeah, you bought that 6 months ago but you forgot about it

03:19:05.820 --> 03:19:10.060
instantly afterward. So I definitely have that problem.

03:19:10.060 --> 03:19:15.620
I have Knights of the Old Republic on the Xbox version but you can play it on the 360.

03:19:15.620 --> 03:19:20.780
I bought that like 2 years ago, actually like 4 years ago, a long time ago. I don't like

03:19:20.780 --> 03:19:27.380
it. I'm one of the few people that cannot stand KOTOR and I saw it on Steam, it was

03:19:27.380 --> 03:19:34.540
only $2.50. I actually, I struggled with myself not to buy it. Anyway, I own this game. I

03:19:34.540 --> 03:19:40.460
don't like it but it's only $2.50. You posted on Facebook or Google or something about that

03:19:40.460 --> 03:19:45.460
and I, cause I remember reading that. One of my friends worked on that game. Really?

03:19:45.460 --> 03:19:51.400
You know what she called it? What? Scrotor. But hey, while she was working on it, we got

03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:54.660
to go to the Skywalker Ranch. Oh, that's when you flung the meatball at George Lucas. No,

03:19:54.660 --> 03:19:58.740
when I wanted to fling meatloaf at George Lucas. He walked by and I could have flung

03:19:58.740 --> 03:20:02.300
meatloaf at him. I changed the story a little bit. I embellished. You know what, Derek,

03:20:02.300 --> 03:20:07.500
I did something similar during this most recent Steam sale. I bought Quake Collection. I didn't

03:20:07.500 --> 03:20:13.500
buy just one Quake game. I bought Quake 1, 2 and 3. Quake 2 isn't even that good. Quake

03:20:13.500 --> 03:20:18.320
1 and 3 were good like 10 years ago but playing them now, like my video card doesn't know

03:20:18.320 --> 03:20:22.980
how to handle Quake 3. Like I was having problems getting Quake 3 to even work. Why am I buying

03:20:22.980 --> 03:20:28.780
Quake 3 when I can just go play Quake Live? I almost bought, when they had a thing where

03:20:28.780 --> 03:20:35.540
you can buy all the Star Wars games or something for like $14, I was like, that's a great deal.

03:20:35.540 --> 03:20:41.740
Even though I had no interest in buying these games when they came out or the years afterwards,

03:20:41.740 --> 03:20:47.840
all of a sudden I think I kind of need these games. But that's how they get people. This

03:20:47.840 --> 03:20:51.660
happens in our culture all the time is that people want to see that they're getting a

03:20:51.660 --> 03:20:55.460
good deal. Like for example, look at all the hilarity that happened on Black Friday. I'm

03:20:55.460 --> 03:21:00.180
sure everybody here saw the video, Derek I'm assuming you probably saw this too, of the

03:21:00.180 --> 03:21:04.620
people at Walmart that were practically jumping on top of each other and clawing each other's

03:21:04.620 --> 03:21:11.460
eye outs over $2 waffle irons. And it's like, who really needs a waffle iron? How many days

03:21:11.460 --> 03:21:17.900
out of the year do you make waffles at home? Yourself? You know? How many days last year

03:21:17.900 --> 03:21:23.620
did you make waffles? Well, I have a friend that makes waffles. But not you. You. You.

03:21:23.620 --> 03:21:29.620
You make waffles weekly? I. Would you trust a $2 waffle iron to make waffles? No. Exactly.

03:21:29.620 --> 03:21:34.620
Unless it was a recognized brand and a Rudolph. But why do people want to kill each other

03:21:34.620 --> 03:21:39.460
over a $2 waffle iron? Because it's $2. If you waff that much then you don't want waffles

03:21:39.460 --> 03:21:48.520
from a $2 waffle iron. We won a waffle iron at a white elephant exchange and Alan actually

03:21:48.520 --> 03:21:53.740
tried to make waffles with it and he got so frustrated he was cussing at this cheap white

03:21:53.740 --> 03:22:01.240
elephant waffle maker that makes little circus animal waffles. But anyway, sorry I'm totally

03:22:01.240 --> 03:22:05.420
going on a tangent, but you know what I mean, in our culture people want to get things just

03:22:05.420 --> 03:22:09.900
because it's a good deal. Okay, so Becky just messaged me and said I make waffles at least

03:22:09.900 --> 03:22:15.420
twice a month. But Becky is also a great cook. Yeah, and she has a really good waffle iron.

03:22:15.420 --> 03:22:19.620
I wouldn't be surprised at all. She probably has a lot of great cooking things that most

03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:25.420
people don't have. So anyway, Alan you look like you're dying to say something over there.

03:22:25.420 --> 03:22:32.780
There's, I'm too lazy to look it up, but there's actually a clinical term culturally for when

03:22:32.780 --> 03:22:37.460
in times of financial hardship, like when the economy's in the shed or just when people

03:22:37.460 --> 03:22:41.880
are broke, they'll go to the gas station when they fill up their car with a tank of gas

03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:45.940
and they'll buy a candy bar and they're not even hungry. But it's just an 89 cent thing

03:22:45.940 --> 03:22:51.020
that makes them feel good that they bought this little thing that just makes them feel

03:22:51.020 --> 03:22:58.220
better because it's cheap. And steam is a great outlet for that impulse that we have

03:22:58.220 --> 03:23:04.100
where I need to buy something, I'm tired of being broke or this is only a dollar, so who

03:23:04.100 --> 03:23:09.360
fucking cares? Retail therapy. Really, I mean, in the end.

03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:15.980
So you're saying I bought Wings of Prey because I'm clinically depressed is what you're saying?

03:23:15.980 --> 03:23:23.980
I don't think it's quite that. That maybe, I don't think we could make that conclusion

03:23:23.980 --> 03:23:28.500
here on the show. No, but people are just driven if something

03:23:28.500 --> 03:23:34.340
is cheap. It just, sometimes it feels good to spend a little bit of money on even if

03:23:34.340 --> 03:23:39.180
it's something that you know that you ultimately won't. I know I do it all the time, but yeah,

03:23:39.180 --> 03:23:42.300
if you make something cheap enough, people will buy it whether they want it or not.

03:23:42.300 --> 03:23:48.940
Maybe it would be a good policy moving forward for people before you buy a steam game, you

03:23:48.940 --> 03:23:54.900
need to walk away for an hour and then say after an hour, okay, do I still really want

03:23:54.900 --> 03:23:57.340
that game? And if the answer is yes, then you buy it.

03:23:57.340 --> 03:24:01.820
You can't do it because they have that countdown on the screen.

03:24:01.820 --> 03:24:06.300
What if I only have 57 minutes? Why do you think I just bought Bastion at

03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:09.420
the start of the show? And I even told you, I said, wait till you

03:24:09.420 --> 03:24:19.500
get home, click done. All right, Derek, good luck with your steam.

03:24:19.500 --> 03:24:25.100
I don't want to say addiction, but your steam issues will say, and hey, at least I hope

03:24:25.100 --> 03:24:28.980
you're getting to play some great games out of it, even if just for 20 minutes.

03:24:28.980 --> 03:24:34.660
I'm going to go play VVV after the show. Hey, VVVV is awesome. Derek, quickly too,

03:24:34.660 --> 03:24:39.500
since I was trying to pimp the big battle earlier, I want our listeners to understand

03:24:39.500 --> 03:24:45.740
why should they sign up for the big battle? Oh, the big battle is a multi community gaming

03:24:45.740 --> 03:24:51.820
tournament. You should do it because gaming is about having fun and you have more fun,

03:24:51.820 --> 03:24:56.420
I believe, when you're competing and even more fun when you're competing for something

03:24:56.420 --> 03:25:00.900
you enjoy. So basically you get to represent your favorite

03:25:00.900 --> 03:25:08.180
like podcasts or whatever and say, hey, we're the best Mortal Kombat players. And it's not

03:25:08.180 --> 03:25:11.700
even we're the best. It's like, you know, you know, it's not really, you're the best,

03:25:11.700 --> 03:25:15.740
but it's something you can hold up over somebody else's head. It's kind of nice. It's always

03:25:15.740 --> 03:25:19.500
fun when you can, when you can compete against all your friends and also you get to meet

03:25:19.500 --> 03:25:22.820
new people, you get to play against people. You probably wouldn't have, you've been playing,

03:25:22.820 --> 03:25:26.020
you've been playing games against the same 20 people for the last four years. Now you

03:25:26.020 --> 03:25:29.140
get to play against some other people who share the same interests as you. It's a good

03:25:29.140 --> 03:25:32.420
thing. I think it's great. And, um, you know, I signed

03:25:32.420 --> 03:25:35.420
up to play and I'm not signing up because I, I'm not going to win. Like, who are we

03:25:35.420 --> 03:25:39.420
kidding here? I'll probably get knocked out the first round, but you know, I may not be

03:25:39.420 --> 03:25:46.780
the best, but I can be the loudest. I think for the, for the Mortal Kombat ones,

03:25:46.780 --> 03:25:51.980
the ringers are the guys from spooky hour horror hour who, who love not only horror

03:25:51.980 --> 03:25:56.420
games, but like everything about horror. So they live and breathe Mortal Kombat. So I

03:25:56.420 --> 03:26:00.420
think they're probably going to be the, the winners there. But you know what? It's good

03:26:00.420 --> 03:26:05.340
to take the, like throw a knife in Tedikins throat every couple of days. That'd be fun.

03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:10.180
That'd be fun. All right. Well, Derek, I gotta let you go. So we wrap up the show, but thank

03:26:10.180 --> 03:26:13.980
you so much for the call. Thank you for doing a show so late tonight. All right. No problem.

03:26:13.980 --> 03:26:18.300
Take care. Bye bye. I didn't realize that God, we were on so damn late. It's like nine

03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:23.500
40 almost. We're usually done at no pink Berry. I know. Right. All right. So I think we might

03:26:23.500 --> 03:26:26.780
need to shut down the Skype line and wrap the show up. I don't know why we're going

03:26:26.780 --> 03:26:30.660
long tonight. I guess we just had a lot to say after a week off. I don't know what else

03:26:30.660 --> 03:26:37.500
to tell you. All right. Um, we finished tweets last minute stories. Usually I turn to Loki

03:26:37.500 --> 03:26:41.980
for that. He's not here. I, I anticipate Alan probably didn't dig anything up. I have one.

03:26:41.980 --> 03:26:46.940
Okay. There's been a clarification about the final fantasy 10 HD remake that Squeenix announced

03:26:46.940 --> 03:26:52.340
in September. Yeah. Um, I guess one of the developers or producers was asked for like

03:26:52.340 --> 03:26:58.620
a timeline and he's like, it's just to make this clear, the final fantasy X remake isn't

03:26:58.620 --> 03:27:06.140
just a texture cleanup and a up and a resolution upscaling. It is a remake. So wow. Redrawing

03:27:06.140 --> 03:27:12.700
of 10. Oh, so redrawing of assets. We just cleaning up the script, new voiceover work.

03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:17.980
It is the real deal. So what everybody wanted from final fantasy seven, 10 is getting 10

03:27:17.980 --> 03:27:24.420
is getting. Yes. Did you just do seven? Well, how about do six? So people thought, how about,

03:27:24.420 --> 03:27:28.620
how about let's really remake a game. Let's, let's take one like six or four. Well, four,

03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:32.860
I guess got the DS from me or may have a remake, but six, six is begging for a really, really

03:27:32.860 --> 03:27:39.020
awesome remake. So interesting. That just came out. Yeah. Stories dated today. Wow.

03:27:39.020 --> 03:27:42.580
Neat. Um, I guess the only other thing I could add is that there might be some of you wondering

03:27:42.580 --> 03:27:46.140
why did we not talk about a certain scandal that was going on around the internet this

03:27:46.140 --> 03:27:53.100
week, um, with this whole marketing company and, and the emails exchange and their device

03:27:53.100 --> 03:27:57.780
and all that. There's two reasons. One, I think a lot of that stuff got really out of

03:27:57.780 --> 03:28:05.460
control. Um, like, was it a slow news week or what? Um, and, uh, you know, I think a

03:28:05.460 --> 03:28:11.060
lot of it's been discussed a lot and I don't know what else there is to add to that too.

03:28:11.060 --> 03:28:15.620
I think Loki really wants to talk about it because he's actually used that controller

03:28:15.620 --> 03:28:19.860
that's at the core of it. I think, although it's important to distinguish between the

03:28:19.860 --> 03:28:25.740
individual that, you know, doesn't know how to deal with customers whatsoever and the

03:28:25.740 --> 03:28:30.840
device itself, Loki has used the device itself and really wanted to comment on it. So I,

03:28:30.840 --> 03:28:35.180
I'm kind of pushing that back to next week so we can discuss that a little more. So just

03:28:35.180 --> 03:28:38.420
so you know, I just wanted to say yes, I'm aware that that happened in the gaming world

03:28:38.420 --> 03:28:44.420
this week, but at the same time, I don't know, I might get shit for this, but whatever. I,

03:28:44.420 --> 03:28:49.460
I kind of, it's not really gaming news. It's gaming community news and game community events

03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:55.300
and I get why people are like following it. But I mean, it's just, it's just like horrible

03:28:55.300 --> 03:29:01.020
train wreck, Ricky Lake holding her hand against the face with the jaw dropped, all that stuff.

03:29:01.020 --> 03:29:07.620
So I can't believe you just made a Ricky Lake reference. Go Ricky, go Ricky. All right.

03:29:07.620 --> 03:29:11.980
I will say though, um, this is Derek had just called in dead pixel live, actually got the

03:29:11.980 --> 03:29:18.060
guy on the show and from what I understand, he apologized. So at that token, you know,

03:29:18.060 --> 03:29:22.800
what else is there to say if he's apologized? But you know, I also kind of think I feel

03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:27.700
bad cause I have no idea what this is about. I'll find out next week or go listen to dead

03:29:27.700 --> 03:29:32.860
pixel live show from Thursday. It's, it's, it's interesting. The whole, the whole debacle

03:29:32.860 --> 03:29:38.100
is interesting, but at the same time I think had this happened in November when Skyrim

03:29:38.100 --> 03:29:42.340
and all these things were coming out, it wouldn't have been as big of a, big of a thing. So

03:29:42.340 --> 03:29:45.620
they did a good job covering it in a more timely manner since, you know, they were able

03:29:45.620 --> 03:29:50.220
to get the guy on like the day after it happened. So I think, uh, I don't know what we could

03:29:50.220 --> 03:29:54.780
contribute to that conversation. It's been five days. That's an eternity in internet

03:29:54.780 --> 03:30:03.940
time. All right. Um, let's see. I think we're ready to wrap it up so we can't really wrap

03:30:03.940 --> 03:30:08.060
it up and put a bow on it and call it done until everybody has given their final thoughts.

03:30:08.060 --> 03:30:11.460
So, um, Alan, I'll start with you. Thank you very much as always for filling in for egg

03:30:11.460 --> 03:30:15.940
host who is not here. Um, appreciate it. And um, you know, now that the show is in your

03:30:15.940 --> 03:30:20.100
house, maybe you'll stop by once in a while and say hello or when Loki's here, I'll just

03:30:20.100 --> 03:30:24.920
play, you know, on the TV the whole time and ignore the show entirely. When we get the

03:30:24.920 --> 03:30:28.500
video going, we can have you playing a game and you know, kind of talk about that and

03:30:28.500 --> 03:30:37.060
we'll see. So, um, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight? Uh, no. Okay. Nothing

03:30:37.060 --> 03:30:42.780
to plug. Nothing. All right. Fair enough. Uh, my final thought tonight is I haven't

03:30:42.780 --> 03:30:47.380
had Hanson soda in a while, but now that I'm having this delicious black cherry soda, I've

03:30:47.380 --> 03:30:51.900
kind of missed it. Dark soccer. Your final thought tonight? I love reading the stories

03:30:51.900 --> 03:31:01.300
on unicorn booty.com. Nice. Oh, I have another final thought. Last night, New Year's Eve,

03:31:01.300 --> 03:31:05.540
we watched a lot of adventure time. Is that what it's called? Adventure time? Cause that

03:31:05.540 --> 03:31:09.260
show is adventure time with Finn and Jake. That show is pretty funny. I will say that

03:31:09.260 --> 03:31:13.420
it's a good show. All right, that's it. We're done. We'll be back next week. Loki will be

03:31:13.420 --> 03:31:18.260
back finally next week and we'll get his top three and a plenty more gaming news. You know,

03:31:18.260 --> 03:31:22.220
we're into a new year. Uh, the news is going to start to come out as we get into the first

03:31:22.220 --> 03:31:28.300
quarter releases and E3 in the summer all towards another clusterfucker releases in

03:31:28.300 --> 03:31:32.340
October, November of 2012 right before the world ends. Have a wonderful week, everybody.

03:31:32.340 --> 03:31:36.620
