00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's the hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Low Crew

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, January 8th, 2012

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Could the next Xbox also be a digital video recorder?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
One retailer suggests a release date for Diablo 3

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
and rumors of new consoles in E3 2012 are already starting

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
www.allgames.com

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
with my co-hosts

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I really like salads

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Salads are delicious

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I just tossed mine

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
No

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Into my mouth

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh dear, that's not better actually

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I know

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Welcome back and welcome to Studio 6, Techmaster Loki

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Hi

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
How are you doing?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Really wish you could have been here last week

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
It's alright, you had family stuff going on

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah, I had to go eat dinner at some

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah, well I had to go get free dinner

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
It sucks, my life sucks

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Alright, chat.orangelaundry.com is the place to be if you are listening live

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Of course, as I mentioned before, we are live every Sunday night

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Tonight, episode number 441

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
January the 8th, 2012

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So Loki, of course you were out last week

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
This is the first time you've ever been to my place, I was realizing

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
That's correct

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Because you needed directions on how to get here

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yes

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
So welcome

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I wish you could have seen it before we created a studio

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
out of what literally was nothing

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
It's pretty awesome

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So, Dark Soccer might be able to remember, I don't know

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
But, anyhow

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
How have you been?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
This table was loaded with paper

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Yes, it was

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It was the paper table

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
How have you been, Loki?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
How was your holiday?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Did you have a good time off?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, it was alright

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I mean, we just

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Hung around the house for the most part

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Just, you know, Josh got a lot of gifts

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And, um

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
In times that he's not awake, I'm playing Skyrim

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Very cool

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
And somebody just joined the chat named

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I love OLR

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, we love you

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I love OLR and chat says

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Swotore, or as I've been calling it on the other show

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Hoard House, Sweatore

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Sweatore leveling, which is of course

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
The Old Republic, Star Wars

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Plus, OLR in the background equals

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Best Sunday night ever

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I gotta admit, that's how I like to listen to live shows

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I've tuned into some of the other all-game shows a few times

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Like Dead Pixel Live, Video Game Outsiders

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
And I'll play WoW

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Because I've only been playing Sweatore for about three weeks

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
But like, I'll play WoW and do PVP and listen to

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
You know, Video Game Outsiders or whatever

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It's a good time

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I remember when my friend was working on Knights of the Old Republic

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And she was calling it Scrotore

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
You know, it would be awesome if you could do that on the Xbox 360

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
You know, stream stuff in

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Like, you know, one of our live stations

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
He has the custom, you know, playlists

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Didn't somebody create an app that did that some time ago?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I can't remember there was an app years ago

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
There was, it's the thing for downloading podcasts, sort of

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
TVercity, TVercity

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Didn't that do it?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Well, that, that you can

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
You can stream stuff to your Xbox 360

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
But not in the background while you're playing stuff

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I believe

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't know

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I don't know about that, maybe you can

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I thought one of them did internet radio

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Maybe you can do that with TVercity

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I know, I just use it for videos

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So I don't really, I've never messed with the music part of it

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I know this would never ever happen

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
But wouldn't it be nice if AllGames.com

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Could get one of those little channel things

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
That you could install and have

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I mean, iHeartRadio, the Clear Channel thing has one

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I mean, they have millions and billions of dollars

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
But AllGames totally has a 20 somewhere

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Maybe in the couch

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I mean, AllGames should be able to get that, right?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Anyhow

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Let's see, Loki, we gotta do some catching up here

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
You were out last week, and last week was the big show

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
We were talking about our top games of 2011

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Because we never really had a proper year-end show

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Because of the way the holidays fell this year

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And we all were speculating

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
What is Loki's top three games of 2011?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Hey, come on, it's gonna be super easy

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Dark Soccer and I guessed

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
We actually, we already have a listener of mine

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I think I remember, I remember three and one

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh yeah, yeah, I think, I don't remember

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Maybe one of the listeners will remind us in the chat room

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What we had picked, but I don't wanna say

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Because I don't wanna influence, so we'll wait

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Loki, let's hear your top three games

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
So number three, what did you think was the third best game of 2011?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
You know, I don't know, because I didn't play a lot of games

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
In 2011, sadly, because I just

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I was really playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto the whole

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, for the most part, up until recently

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
But that's not, that didn't come out in 2011

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
So that doesn't count

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
We did allow, it was, the criteria was

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Your top game of the year

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And that might not actually be a game that came out this year

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Because so many good games come out at the end of 2010

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Or in Alan's case, he put Dragon Age Origins as his number two game of the year

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Because he just started playing it this year

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
And we said, okay, you're allowed

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Every gamer gets their voice, even if it's a tardy voice

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, that's tough, and I would say

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto was pretty awesome

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
And, I mean, it was nice to be able to play the mods again

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Briefly, until they patched it again

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I would say probably my number three would be

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare, I guess

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
All right, we called it

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Did we call it? I think we did, yeah

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, Modern Warfare

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It's just fun now

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
And especially because, you know, the whole reason we switched to that game

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Is because my co-workers were very pissed

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Or tired of me beating them in Grand Theft Auto

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And they're just like

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
They're just like, oh, we gotta switch it up, we gotta play a game

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
You know, my boss

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh, I've played Call of Duty, you know

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I think I should be a little bit better than Loki is at that

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Unfortunately, what they found out

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And, see, I didn't play a lot of Call of Duty at all

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I mean, I've literally, before we started playing it

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
I'd played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1 once

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Once split screen, and that was it

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
And I didn't really care for it the first time we played it

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
But I ended up being really good at it, apparently

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And a lot better than them

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
And they are pissed

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Because it didn't help

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And it's actually been a lot worse now

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Because I'm so stealthy in that game

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
That I'll just sneak up behind them and do something funny

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And they'll be like, hey, hey

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
And then kill them

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Alright, so you like this game because you can own the shit out of everybody

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's pretty fun

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
It's actually, Call of Duty, at least the Modern Warfare games and stuff

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I mean, they really cater that stuff

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Especially the multiplayer portion

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
But they really have it down pat

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
And it's smooth, it works well

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And it's just very fun and streamlined

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
It's good

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
That's not a series of games

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm not really into the war games

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm terrible at first person shooters unless it's called Quake

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
But you know what though

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
And I agree, playing it online

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Like free for all deathmatch

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Not very fun

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Playing it team deathmatch online

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
That's a lot of fun

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Well yeah, I watched

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I didn't talk about this last week

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
But I actually watched over the holiday

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
We were with some of Alan's family

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And some of his brothers were playing

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Modern Warfare 3

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And I was kind of watching them like, wow, it looks really good

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And they were doing this interesting playback thing

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Where he was showing us a video

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Where his whole team hid in a bus

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And the other team was looking for him everywhere

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And couldn't find him

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
And it took him like 10 minutes or something

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
To find the team that was in the bus

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Because this one guy inadvertently stood up

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I get why people are into this

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
It's actually a pretty fun game

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
There's a lot of haters

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
A lot of hate for Modern Warfare

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
And I can't really speak for 2 and 3

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Because I haven't played 2 and 3

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So I don't know how much they've changed

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
But I can only imagine it's about as much as they've changed

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
From Call of Duty 2 to 3

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Which wasn't a whole lot

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It was just pretty much

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
They have the game and that's it

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I know a lot of it's catered towards multiplayer nowadays

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
But you know what?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
It's pretty fun

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I like what they were talking about

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
That they were doing with the elite services

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I can see where people would like that

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
But my whole thing before was

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Just getting into online actually playing free for all death matches

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And stuff

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
It doesn't seem very fun

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And I've actually played it

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And I don't know, there's still a lot of people cheating online

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You run into a lot of people running infection mods

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
And stuff like that

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
But Team Deathmatch actually doesn't seem to be plagued with that crap

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So it seems a lot more fun that way

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And I actually do pretty well

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Considering I'm ranked 5

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
That's pretty low

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
When you consider there's 11

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, 11 prestigious

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Or 10 prestigious

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And you can level up again on 10th prestige

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And 55 levels per

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And people actually do level up

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm not sure if everyone does it legitimately

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
So it's fun

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Let's move on to your number 2 choice

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Number 2, best game of 2011

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's tough because this game

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
A couple weeks ago

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Might have been number 1

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
But it's not

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Because it's kind of like

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
It's kind of like an actual person

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Sort of, Elder Scrolls Skyrim

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
2 for 2, Dark Sakura

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And the reason why

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Elder Scrolls Skyrim is number 2

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And not number 1

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Is because the longer you play it

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
The worse it gets

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And it's not necessarily that the game is getting worse

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It's just it's getting buggier

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It's just it took an arrow to the knee

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
It's seriously getting buggier and buggier

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
That meme needs to die right now

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Right now

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It needs to self inflict an arrow in its own knee

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I want to know why there's no representing the love

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
For, there's a guy that says

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
He took a sword to the chest

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Huh? I don't see any sword to the chest

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, let me say arrow to the knees guy, you sound like a pussy

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Sword to the chest?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
You don't come back from that

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
He did apparently

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, it's gotten progressively buggier

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
In fact I was complaining about it the other day on Facebook

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Um

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
There's a quest I can't finish now because

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
The NPC for the quest is spawned under the map

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I can't get to them

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's literally in a spot that is inaccessible

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Alan got a pretty amazing bug this week

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I should have him come on and explain it

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm gonna butcher this

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Hopefully he hears, oh here he comes, yeah

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Alan hears me struggling

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
What kind of Skyrim bug you got this week?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
So when I go to

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Whiterun, which is the main city in the center

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
The first major city you go to

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm not a criminal

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I don't have a bounty

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I could talk to guards, they're like, oh hey sup bro

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Like you're orcish armor

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I go into Dragon's Reach where the Jarl is

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And right when I go up the stairs

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
The Jarl and his bodyguard are like

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Oh shit, get him

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
And like the whole room agros

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And I'm like, I'm dead, I didn't do anything

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So I left

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And I just did other shit for like 8 hours

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And I went back

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And it's fine

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It's fine now, so I can use the enchanting table in there

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
But I was like, that was weird

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Magically fixed itself, fantastic

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I love this comment in our chat room

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Zenthral says, the guy that invented that mem

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
The arrow to the knee thing, needs to take a sack to the chin

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Okay

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
The arrow to the knee thing, yeah

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
We get it, the NPCs

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Repeat themselves a lot

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Hell, I mean all the shopkeeps say the same thing too

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Some consider this trash

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I consider them treasures

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Well considering how fucking vast that game is though

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I mean

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't know

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It's just

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
It's

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It's getting incredibly buggy

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
And to the point where it's actually breaking the game

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
But I mean

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
It's still fun, I'm still playing

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I had to kind of force myself not to play this week

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So I can get some other stuff done

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Because I have over 85 hours in the game now

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
And although I have exploited pretty much every glitch possible in the game

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
To level myself up to the point where I can't die anymore

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And I kill everything in one hit

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And it's still fun

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
And I can sneak up right to somebody in plain daylight

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And be standing right in front of them and they can't see me

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Which is kind of fun

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
But yeah, the fact that I can't finish that quest

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
That sucks, and the fact that sometimes

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Parts of the land don't spawn

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And I can't, you know, I fall through them

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Or uh

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Other fun stuff, oh

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Sometimes when you kill a dragon or whatever

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
It'll do one more lap around the sky and then crash epically

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
You know, it's just like

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Really? You have to do that

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You can just die and fall to the ground

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Alright, so despite all the crappy bugs

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
It's still your number two game of the year because

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I played it a lot

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And I'm still playing

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Alright, your number one game of twenty

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I mean, come on

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Seriously, you gotta ask

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What is your number one game of 2011?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Let's say it's World of the Third

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Ah, three for three, right there

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Actually, didn't we go back and say though

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
That Earth Defense Force was gonna end up number three?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, but then we allowed the old game rule

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah, alright

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
See, if it wasn't the old game rule

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I probably would have been number three

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Only by default because

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
They sucked

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And Earth Defense Force, it was all right

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
It was pretty fun for a while, but man

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It's pretty boring now

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
They promised, oh, we're gonna deal with this TLC

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
It's gonna be so fucking awesome

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And nothing

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Why Saints Row the Third?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
It's such an over the top game

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It's just incredibly fun

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It was everything I wanted that game to be

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And more

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Honestly, I wanna finish it

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And get all a thousand achievement points

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
But I just, once again, there's

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
A buggy portion of the game

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And it happens to be kind of like the terrible part of it

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Where you have to do these car jacking things

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
And steal certain cars

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
To unlock stuff

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It's on their Saints book thing

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It's just broken

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And if it wasn't broken

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I probably would be done with that

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Well, with all the achievements at least

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Sad there wasn't any competitive multiplayer in it

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I mean, that's kinda lame

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I do really wanna play the

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Co-op in it

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I think that would be pretty fun

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I do have to play through it again now

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
As a woman so I can get the other achievements

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And the DLC

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I'm looking forward to it

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Although I'm not too optimistic

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
On if it being really good

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Cause the new, like from the achievements

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
That were leaked out for the

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Upcoming stuff

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
It just sounds like a bunch of extra excursions

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And some of it, I mean, that would probably be pretty fun

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But, you know

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
The activities

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
It's cool doing them sometimes

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
But I don't like being forced to doing them

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I would rather have some actual missions to the game

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But it just sounds like it's all activities

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
So, we'll try it

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I mean, it'll be alright

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
But I'm not gonna be one of those persons

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And I haven't been

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I'm not gonna be one to buy every single piece of download content

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Just because I like the game

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
That's not how I'm gonna do it

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Alright, so you're number one game of the year

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Number three, and then you proceeded to slam each game

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
There it is, your top three

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Of the year

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Can you get, Dark Soccer and I

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Have the same game as number one, can you guess?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
The same game as number one

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
World of Warcraft?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
No

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Good guess though

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Star Wars the old

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
No, I'm not playing that

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I showed Dark Soccer it for five minutes

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And she was like, I don't get it

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
No, I got it, I just didn't really care

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Number one game

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Better not be something like The Sims Social

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
No, God no

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Think more, it'll be easier to guess her

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Here's a clue

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh, it's you

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
How have you been?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I've been really busy being dead

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Oh my God, I forgot Portal 2

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Fuck that, Call of Duty is out of this

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
See, that's what happens when that comes out way too early

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Call of Duty, fuck it

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Move them all back

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Portal 2 number one, all the rest can be

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Skyrim number three

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Saints Row the Third

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
So there we go, so after

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Some coercing, we finally get Loki to agree

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
So it's official, the official OLR game of 2011

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Is Portal 2

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I played through that game what, four times all the way through?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It's great

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I completely forgot that that game came out

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
This year, and that's really bad

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Because I think a lot of the

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Game of the Year stuff, I mean a lot of people

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Talked about Portal 2, but

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I literally forgot that that came out this year

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Well, and you know

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I actually have that, oh, it's you

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Memorized very well, because that's my

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Message tone on my phone now

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah, so I mean, yeah, Portal 2

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
For sure

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I completely forgot

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I feel so bad

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
But seriously, where the fuck is

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Where the fuck is some DLC for that?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
They had some of the stuff on the PC

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Any other guesses

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
What might have been on our list?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Technically

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Um

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Final Fantasy XIV

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Hell to the no

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
That would be in like three biggest

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Disappointments of the year

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Super Mario 3D Land

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
You got it, it was my number three

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Mario Kart 7

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Arkham City was my number two

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Arkham City was my number three

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
What was your number two? I forgot

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Um

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Hold on, I actually have

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
No, I

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I'll have to check on my hard drive

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Because I

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Spazinator says the number one game was Singstar Abba

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
L-O-O-J-K

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I know what my, um

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Wrong, it's not Singstar Abba, it's Abba, you can dance

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
He was so hilarious playing that

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
No, but they also have Singstar Abba on the PS3

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I know that

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I remember that Tiara was in town when you got that

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And we came and played it at the old house

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
But, um

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I know what my honorable

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Mention was, Fractal

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Because that game is cool

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Fractal is a really neat puzzler

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Alright, oh Marvel vs. Capcom

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, Marvel vs. Capcom

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It just hit me, all of a sudden

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Alright, let's

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Uh, quickly, our intro is running a little long

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I wanted to just quickly say something about this

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Because, Loki, you tweeted it to me

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I've had listeners tweet me more stories

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
About this whole Xbox hacking stuff

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And, god, we've been talking to our

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Blue in the face about it since August

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You know, if you don't know by now

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Uh, I was hacked back in August

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And people were saying, oh, you let

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Your password get out, oh, you got phish

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Microsoft's saying, oh, you got phish, I'm like, no

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I'm a little smarter than that in the websites I visit

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
But, no, apparently it was my own damn fault

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Well, now that more and more people are getting hacked

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And more and more people are having problems with Microsoft

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Finally, it's getting out there, some gal has set up a Tumblr

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Where she was sharing her experiences

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
For some reason, it caught wildfire

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And I think a lot of it is because

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
She had screen caps with Xbox support

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
She was screen capping the emails

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And it gave a lot of the gaming press, I guess, for whatever reason

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
They're really, really bored

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
What really was taking me off this week

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And you linked me an article from IGN

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
That literally said nothing

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Literally said nothing, it said, yeah

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Xbox is claiming that they're getting hacked

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
But, Microsoft says

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
They have no comment on the situation

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
So, you know

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And apparently

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
This guy on this website

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Was the first to break the news

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
A couple weeks ago, and it's like

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That's kind of insulting

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
When we were here in August, talking about

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm not saying we should, that's not what I'm saying

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Because there were probably way other people

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Before me, in fact I know people who were hacked

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Before me

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It's just irritating

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
That it's not news until it happens to somebody

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Who has

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Listen, just because a dude works in an office

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
For a company that makes a lot of money

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Doesn't mean he's any better than any other blogger

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I mean, there's a lot of really stupid ass posts

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
That are on a lot of major websites

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
IGN

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Especially

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
That have not a lot of research in there

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
And, I mean, I think they got

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
The comment from, what is it

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Steven Toulouse, or whatever his name is

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Support, I don't know what the hell he is

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Something that Xbox put

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
That customer service related

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm not going to touch on Blowing the Fate

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Go listen to that last show from 2011

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Episode number four

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
How old night are we on tonight?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
441

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Go listen to 439

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Would have been the last one from, we had Justin on

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Who was talking about how he got

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Broken into twice

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Go, I mean, that's really all you need to hear

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And I don't want to keep talking about this

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
But seriously, if you have not changed your password

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
At this point, do not

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Microsoft is swearing up and down

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
That they're doing everything

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
They're being ignorant

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That's really the only word

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Microsoft is ignorant

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
EA is ignorant

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
The higher ups in those companies are ignorant

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
To the situation that's going on right now

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Your money is at risk if your credit card is on your account

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I have been sitting here telling you this

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Blue in the face since August

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Change your F and password, it's not that hard to do

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Use a unique password on Xbox

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
That you don't use anywhere else

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Put, like, put XB at the end of it

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Or something, or put, you know

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
MS with a dollar sign

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Just make something that differentiates it

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
For the record, neither of us have been hacked

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It's, it's, the thing is though

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Is, once again, they

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Um, but

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
They're right, and they're wrong at the same time

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I think Dan always paid with points cards

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And also, hundreds and thousands

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Of people have been, you know

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And including people I know that haven't touched

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Their Xboxes in forever

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Well, I'm just saying it's safer to

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Pay with points cards

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
The only card I have ever had on there

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Was one that I knew was gonna expire in a month that I wasn't

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Gonna renew

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I would still change your password

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
You might have people in there downloading

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
What they can do, they can transfer

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
They might not charge anything, but what a lot of them

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Have been doing, have they been logging

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
In and then downloading the licenses

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
To their local Xboxes

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And basically siphoning all your games

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Which can cause you headaches later on

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I'm just saying

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Well, I've checked all my licenses and they're still on mine

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
But I've also never had gold on my

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Account either

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Now, Microsoft's not

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I wouldn't say they're ignorant

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
But what their statement is true

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
It's just, okay

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Here's what it is

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
They're saying basically two things

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
One, Live.com has not been compromised

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And two, that

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
People are being phished

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
And that's how their

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Credentials are being

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Leaked out or compromised

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
There's two things that are

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I mean, yes, true

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
They are not

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Live.com is not compromised

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
But people are not being phished

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The whole thing was

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
All this stuff is coming from the hacks

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
That happened a while back and I even think it was

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
The anonymous stuff where they were dumping

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
A bunch of, and it might not even necessarily

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Be them, but something similar to

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
The fact where they dump the email passwords

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Combos

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
From random forums

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Or even gaming websites or whatever

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
EA may have even been one of those, I don't know

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I think EA is the weak link

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And I've been saying this for forever

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Why does every single hack seem to come back

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
To one of the EA games

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And I get FIFA 12's gold pack thing

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Where they're taking the cards and trading with other accounts

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That whole thing, I get that

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But why, if

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
All these accounts are being sold on a Polish

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Website or all these accounts

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Are being bought and sold on there

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Why are they not selling accounts

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
With other games too

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Why does it always come back to FIFA

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Because FIFA is a popular game

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
In other countries

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
There's other popular games in other countries

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Why is it always freaking FIFA

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
But the DLC for FIFA is a lot more

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Expensive than buying a map pack for Call of Duty

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Or something

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Where there's smoke there's fire and it seems like

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
FIFA is the common thing between

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
All this, there's something about that game

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Or EA servers that are allowing this to happen

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
EA sells a lot of garbage DLC

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
People buy it

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And it's worth more

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
That's really what it's coming down to

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But it doesn't matter

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You should be using a unique password

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And email combination

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
On Xbox

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
That's pretty much what

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
You have to do

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Let's assume that even

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Right now they're claiming

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Phishing

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
What evidence do they have that there's actual phishing

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Going on? They have no evidence

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
They're just making assumptions

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Because all they know is

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's gotta be phishing

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But what they should do is

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Listen, hey, you know

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I think I've seen one of them say that

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Someone that was associated with

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Xbox said, hey, you know

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
There were these hacks that happened

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
A lot of this email password

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Combos got out

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And what they're doing

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
In fact, Anonymous said to do this

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
When they leaked this crap out

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Try it in Facebook, try it in Yahoo

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Try it in Gmail, try it in Twitter

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Use these login credentials

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
To get in access to other people's stuff

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Because these people should be changing their accounts

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Because these websites got hacked

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
So that's what it is

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
You need to change that stuff

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Because if you use the same email

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And password combination

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Or even username password

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
For every single website that you visit

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Then you're gonna

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
If someone gets one of those, they've got them all

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Alright, so again

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
We've spent way too much time talking about this

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
In the past on the show

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
If you tweet me and say

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
My Xbox got hacked, I'm gonna tweet you back

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
And say, I'm really sorry to hear that

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
But I told you to change your password in August

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Now if you tweet me back and say, I changed my password

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Back in August, I really do want to hear those

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Because then that would prove

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Something fishy's going on

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm not talking fishing

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
But if you haven't

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Changed your password by now

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I don't know what else to tell you

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Like, the evidence is out there

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It's growing

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
And finally, the mainstream press

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Is coming around

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
And telling you to change your password too

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
So just do it

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Even though Microsoft and EA and all of them are refusing to admit there's a problem

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It's clear that there's a problem

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Alright

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Let's see

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Moving on

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I want to talk about our gaming weeks

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And we always like to start off the show

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Even when it's really 30 minutes into the show

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Talking about what video games have you been playing this week

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
There's been things that you've been playing

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
DarkSakura, what have you been up to?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Well, I have been playing WoW

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
But I've been reading books

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
WoW books

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And I was at Goodwill

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Someone had the first two books of the War of the Ancients series

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And I was like, I'm kind of a lore nerd

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I'll read them

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
They're really well written

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I mean, I can

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
A lot of books that you get that are tie-ins to series

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Are kind of like, oh meh

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
These are actually really good books

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And that's just reading it

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
You know, in between times

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Really good books

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I also

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Played some Fractal

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And I installed Bastion

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I haven't played it yet

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
But it's really been Fractal and WoW

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And we picked up DJ Hero 2 today

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
The girl installed the game

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
But she couldn't find the time

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
We got DJ Hero 2 today

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
The bundle set

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
For 20 bucks at Big Lots

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
So that's what tomorrow was

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Woohoo bargaining

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I know, right

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And I've also been playing Scare Shermie

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Which was

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I finally figured out how to sneak up on Shermie

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Vacuum something in front of her

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
She's too busy staring at it

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
In absolute horror

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
You can actually sneak up on her

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And she'll jump

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I think I saw a tweet

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Or a chat comment or something earlier

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
That said, I miss Shermie

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
There are two cats here

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
In this studio, but they're afraid of people

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
They like to run and hide

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
So they're currently probably under my bed

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Maruko loves me

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, but they don't know Loki

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And so they're probably like, who's that guy

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Maruko was sitting next to me, cuddling

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
While I was reading

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
He walks around with his tail in the air, showing off his butt

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Look at my butt

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I was getting the occasional stink eye

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
From Sanrio

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, mostly, and I was reading those books here

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
By the way, reading them here

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And looking at your video games, seeing which ones I was gonna run off with

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Not really

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I was out of town, by the way, Disneyland

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Mostly, it's just been

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
That we've still been arranging a lot of stuff from the move

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
So we haven't had

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
A significant amount of time

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Also, the issues with my hand are getting worse again

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
So I can't really sit down

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And play for very long

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Well

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
This week I didn't really play much

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Because I play Call of Duty at work

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Which is fine

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Like I said, my coworkers are trying

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Multiple ways to get me to

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Not be as good

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Including, as of Friday

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
They taped a piece of cardboard

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
To my monitor with a few random holes poked in it

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And of course, you know

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Blocking about 90% of the monitor

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I still managed to stealth kill

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
A few people with a knife doing that

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
But yeah, I could not aim and shoot

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
At anybody because there was nothing in the direct center

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So it made it very difficult to

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Try to actually shoot somebody

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Um

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
And then, um

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Let's see what else

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Oh, and I played Skyrim

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Earlier in the week

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But I, you know, stopped

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Playing it this week just so I could get some

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Other stuff done because every time I'm like

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Well, I could work on this, or I could play Skyrim

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I want to play Skyrim

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
And

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I started going through

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Some of the Thief Guild stuff

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I started a

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Quest in Winterhold

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
And

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
It crashed

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Well, the quest crashed because

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Apparently if you do something out of order in that

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Quest, it breaks

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You know, something that would be very obvious

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
To anybody that tested the game

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But I don't think anybody tested the game

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Or there's too damn much to test

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
That's also probably part of the problem

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
There's too much damn stuff to test

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
But you would think that the first things they would test

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Would be, I don't know, the quest from the game

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I mean, obviously

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
They can't test

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
If you step on this rock over here

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And you get launched into space

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Or something like that, because there's a lot of

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Landmass to go wander around and test

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Every single random event that would happen

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
But I would think an actual quest

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
In the game

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Um, it would be very obvious

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That it's not working correctly

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
But I don't care

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I don't have to finish that quest

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm not a necessarily completionist in this case

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
But it's just still annoying though

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
That something like that would break

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I mean, I don't mind if like

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
You know, a

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
A character gets trapped in a wall or something like that

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Okay, I did mind that a little bit

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
And I had to reload a few times, but

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
It's just, it's getting to the point now

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Where I'm actually starting to get the

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Frame stutters and stuff like that

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Like, it's stopping

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Going, stopping, and going

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And I have to stop moving for a second

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
For it to catch up

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
That's not good, that's the PS3 crap

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
That, you know, is going on right now

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I think I might try to get back into some Skyrim this week

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
We'll see, because I've kind of, I'm a little

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
MMO'd out right now

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
But I'll get to my own week in a minute

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Yes we do

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
That would make WoW more interesting

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And I'm not really sure if we want to talk about it right now

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
But I've also, like I told you

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
That I've been, my coworkers

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Have been finding ways to try to

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Hinder my gameplay in Call of Duty

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Let me set this up a little bit

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Because this is one of the stories we didn't talk about

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
A lot last week, because it seemed like it was everywhere

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And it's not really a story

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
It was really something that caught

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Fire in a non-news

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Week, I mean, yes, the

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Guy was an idiot, but it was just

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
That guy got taken to the cleaners

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
It was just like, really? This is how bored

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
We are, but it's

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Obviously we're talking about the ocean marketing thing

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And the whole controller that they were promoting

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Was the Avenger

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Now, I think we can all separate the controller

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
From the situation

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
And this one guy with the ego

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
However, ironically enough

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Loki had procured a copy

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Of this controller

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
We've had one of these for months now

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And was ready to review it on the show

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
When this all happened

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
So, Loki, go ahead, the Avenger controller now

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Okay, the Avenger controller

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
It's basically, I mean

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Different spins I've heard on it

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
One, yes, it's created by a guy

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I think he was a teacher or something like that

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
And his reasoning behind it

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Was, oh, I wanted to make

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Something that made games a little bit

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
More accessible for

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
People with disabilities or something like that

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Because he knew somebody that had trouble

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
With a range of motion or something like that

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
So they had

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Issues reaching

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
The buttons or something

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I don't know what the case may be

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
But that said, though, the way they're

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Marketing it is not necessarily

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
You know, oh, this is for people

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
That have disabilities

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Or, oh, yeah, and if you have disabilities

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
That would be good, too, but no

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
It's supposed to be something that actually

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Decreases the amount of

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Latency

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Between your reaction

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And hitting the buttons

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
And the way they do that is by putting these

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Extra arms above

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
The

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
X, Y, and

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
B buttons

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
These arms reach out over

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Behind the trigger and kind of

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
On the middle of your finger

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
For the B button as well

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Am I doing this right? I'm holding this right now

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
You kind of lift up?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Yeah, you're supposed to lift up and it's supposed to hit the button

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It's a little interesting

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
You can adjust those arms, too

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Because that's adjusted for me right now

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
You're supposed to hit up

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
And then for the triggers now

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You can see on the triggers

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
There's a rubber band thing that goes underneath the bottom

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You're supposed to pull up on the bottom

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
With your finger to pull the trigger

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Because the way they have it

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It's tightened to the point now where

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It's just to the point where

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
It's going to trigger the actual

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Button

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
On the actual trigger

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
That's supposed to cut down

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
The amount of time it takes you

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
To

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Press the trigger buttons

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
It doesn't make you better in games

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Because you're hitting buttons faster

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
And your reaction time is faster

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
That's all good on paper

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
But it doesn't work that way, unfortunately

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Because you have to retrain yourself

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
To play games

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And it's actually very fucking awkward

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
To play with that

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
It was harder to play Call of Duty

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And I gave it

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I think I gave it a fair amount of time

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I'd say a total of about

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
About five hours worth of gameplay

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
That I played during lunches

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
On Call of Duty with that

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I played during our

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Morning and afternoon

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And deathmatch games and stuff like that

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And I still was alright

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
But it was just a hassle

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Especially trying to trigger certain buttons

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
And I don't really

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I mean, Call of Duty

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I don't think a lot of people really need to hit

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
The face buttons fast

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Because it's like, reload

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Yeah, okay, reload

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Or like switching weapons or crouching

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
You don't really need that

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I'm really curious, though, about the

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
So obviously you just find it awkward

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And I gotta admit, when I'm holding it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I don't really play shooters, though

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
For me, this would not be an advantage

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
But accessibility is a big thing

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
About this dark soccer

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm really curious what you think

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Having your hand issues

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
It's really my first two fingers

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And the things that

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I really don't like all this crap on top of it

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
But I like the two extensions

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
On the triggers

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
And you see how there's a rubber bandy thing?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
You can also tug on that

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
And that triggers it, too

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
But this actually is much more comfortable

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
To my finger because I don't have to

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Have it up and put my hand in an awkward position

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
The whole problem I have with the triggers

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Is that

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I have to move my hand

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Much higher up to reach them

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And if I had something that

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Would work for

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
The top two triggers instead of the back one

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Like this long piece

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It would be very comfortable for me

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
So like a half Avenger would be really good

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
For dark soccer?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Well, unfortunately, the part that you can take off the Avenger

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Are the actual trigger buttons

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I don't know what they call them, paddles

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Or whatever the hell on the back there

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Those are the things you can take off

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
If you don't like

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Pulling on the actual skis

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Or whatever the hell that's called

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Derek H. in our chatroom at chat.orangesonshade.com

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Says, Loki should tape three of his fingers together

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
To simulate how it is supposed to be used

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Honestly, it's a waste of money

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
To be honest

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I think I want one

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
My opinion is it's a waste of money

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
See, it's very, very interesting

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So like for you

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
The normal controller doesn't bug you

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
But for her, she's like

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Okay, now I can see maybe something that might

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Let me play games a little longer

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
You should just give her yours

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
But here's the thing though

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Jamie, you're having trouble hitting some of the

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
These would need to be adjusted

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Okay, but the buttons that you have trouble

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Hitting are the shoulder buttons, right?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Yeah

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Okay, well they have controllers that have

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Remappable buttons that would be on the bottom

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Of the controller that you would hit with

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
One of your middle fingers

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
You drop Siri

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
On the

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
On this controller

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
It's just the problem is

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
$50 first off

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
For not a controller

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
They call it a controller, it's not a fucking controller

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
It's a piece of shit that attaches to a controller

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
If it were a controller, I would be able to take this off

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
And play with just this

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And it would work just fine

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
$50 for that's a little steep

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I mean, and really

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I understand that there could be uses for it

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
As far as

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
People

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Like they said right here

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
The rocker

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
They said players with larger or smaller hands

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
May utilize the rocker for added

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Comfort

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
With smaller or larger hands

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
What's it meant for? I mean, I don't understand

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Comes equipped with an

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Optional stabilizing stand

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Tension straps and trigger skis

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
These are called trigger skis apparently

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And they suck, they do not work

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I've tried pulling the trigger using this

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
It does not work, I mean

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Really what would make the controller

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
In general better for me

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Is just to extend the top to where the two triggers

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Are further back

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
They have also these

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Sticker things that I pulled off of here already

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Because I'm planning on reselling this

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Because it's a piece of shit

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
They had one that plucked

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And that's the other thing too

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
You'll notice that there's actually the triggers for all the buttons

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Except for the A button

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You still have to move your thumb off of here

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
To push jump

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And it's recessed because now there's this hunk of garbage

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
On top of the controller

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
To hit the A button

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
So their solution is there's a sticky pad

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
That you can put on top of there

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So not worth the price at all

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
It's not worth the price

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But maybe an accessibility thing

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Maybe if you have issues

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You might want to try one

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Honestly I think it could be done better

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
If it's an accessibility thing I think it could be done better

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And if you're having trouble hitting

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
If you want something that's gonna hit these

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Face buttons or whatever

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I'd recommend if you're playing Call of Duty

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
They had one either for Modern Warfare 2

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Or Black Ops

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
They had a controller with two

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
It was from Mad Catz with two buttons on the bottom

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
That were mappable to either the

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Left stick, right stick, or L3, R3

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
And then the four face buttons

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And you can hit those buttons

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
On the bottom

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Using, I guess it would be

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Let me see here

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
It would be probably with your middle finger

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
To hit those buttons on the bottom

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And that's actually not too bad

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Because the comfort goes

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
So that would be my recommendation

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And that, for 50 bucks, you actually get a controller

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
That you can use straight out of the box and go

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
This is $50

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Plus you have to have a $60

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Controller to plug it on top of

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
So it's $110

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
And I love their website

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
And this is another reason for me to hate G4

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
But I love their website

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Because they have a bunch of different

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Reviews on it

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
And one of them was from G4

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
This and the controller from Evil Controllers

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Which is ironic because this controller

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I have in here is a modded controller

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
From Evil Controllers

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Yes, and they're fucking expensive

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
So I don't recommend buying them because it's not

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
You can get it way cheaper and stuff

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
But they're still nice

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
They're like

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Their review

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
And this is Adam Sessler on fucking X-Play

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Their review was

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
We don't like the Evil Controllers because

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
The rapid fire controller is cheating

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Well if you guys like cheating then

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
That was their negative

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Review for Evil Controllers

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
But we like this Avenger one because it's not cheating

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
That was the reason they liked it

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
So there's

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Your educated

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Review for that

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Interesting side though, did you hear

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
G4 has a new president now

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
It has to do with the whole Comcast

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
G4 is a Comcast network and the whole

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Comcast NBC thing that's happening

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Interesting

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Because

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
They were trying to pull

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
With a lot of the stuff

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Well you know

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
The Avenger was

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
It was meant for people with

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Disabilities and stuff and they tried to swing

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
That whole emotional like

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I've got to feel sorry for them and stuff

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
They donated a child's play and stuff

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Because of this whole bad PR and the fact that

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
They still haven't delivered these pieces of shit controllers

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Yeah I got one of these months ago so they were done

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
They just haven't manufactured them

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I mean it's fucking plastic

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
So I don't know why it's taking so long

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And that's

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
And that's the way that they were marketing it

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Except the problem is

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
It's not Avenger

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
The controller to allow

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
All gamers to play games

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Including those with disabilities

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Avenger! The ultimate gaming advantage

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And no I'm sorry it's not an advantage

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
It's actually quite a disadvantage and I seriously

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I would recommend

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
You know what if you're going to spend a lot of money on controllers

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Buy a professionally modded controller

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Or you know those actual

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
The Mad Catz ones and they have the

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Ones for the major league gamers

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Or whatever that actually looked pretty cool

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And so I'd pick up one of the nicer

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Controllers instead of a $50 piece of crap

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Alright

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
That's enough clearly we know how you feel

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
About that Loki so that's enough

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Alright I gave it a fair share I mean

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I played for that for five hours and trust me

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I did not want to play for that

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You know long a time with that controller

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Which is terrible

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Alright my gaming week quickly I don't have a lot to really add

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Because there hasn't really been any new games to come out

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So it's been basically more

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Sweat Tour, Star Wars The Old Republic

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
And Warcraft of course

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Because that's every week

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Randomly got an urge to play Super Mario World

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Am I weird?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I have a Super Nintendo sitting right there in a Mario World cart

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Yet I've been playing it on the Wii

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I've been playing on the Wii with the classic controller

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
And I've been doing that because you can

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Remember in Mario World you can only save after you beat

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Like a ghost house or a fortress

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
But thanks to Wii save states

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Not really save states but you can just kind of hit the home button

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Anywhere and it remembers right where you're at

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
So that's pretty cool

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Yeah so I've been playing that just old school

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
A little bit and finally tried PVP

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
In Sweat Tour

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
And it was actually really fun I love the commentators

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Oh my god that part was really funny

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
As you're playing there's actually live commentators

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Like you know oh they just killed

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
A guy on the frog pants team

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
They took him down it was just really funny

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Is Greg Proops in there again?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
No it's not Greg Proops

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Such a missed opportunity I mean he's not doing anything

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
The frog knobs or something

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I don't know the teams have funny names

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
What's he doing now he's like hosting some like

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Some weird news on Yahoo

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Or something like that I mean come on

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
The guy's not doing anything right now

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
No no no he's got his podcast it's great

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Smartest man in the world I would endorse that podcast

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I have to say I listened to it in Rob's car

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
He can squeeze out some more voice work

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
For a game come on

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Come on just throw some money his way he'd do it

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Alright um

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Let's see so that was really my gaming week

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
We've been going on a long time

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
We gotta get into housekeeping real real quick

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Now I have to admit I'm changing my tone

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Here a little bit because I was about to come on here

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
And really point the finger and shake it

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
At the listeners because we have not had a lot

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Of people signing up for the big battle

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Tonight's news Loki why don't you start

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Us off alright let's talk a little

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Bit about Atari

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
And some of their

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I guess witch hunts

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Over

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Infringing

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
IOS games apparently they're going after

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Everybody that has games that look like theirs

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
And whether that you know they're just

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
A blatant rip off of like say

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Asteroids or Breakout or something like that

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Or if it just happens to be you know

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
A tank game with vector tanks you know

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
In fact

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
One indie app creator

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Black Powder Media

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
They have a game

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
That's been pulled

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Off of the

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
App store because of

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Claims from Atari of

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Copyright infringement of course their game

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Is very similar I guess it looks

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Similar to Battlezone

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Vector tanks is the game

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And apparently

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
They're going after everybody

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
And you know Atari

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You know release the same instance

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
For companies like Atari our intellectual property

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Portfolio is our

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Most valued asset

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
While we have a great respect for any

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Development community and greatly appreciate

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
The enthusiasm that they have for

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Our renowned properties we need to vigorously

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Protect our intellectual property

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
And ensure that it's represented

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
In a highly innovative

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Represent highly innovative

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Games okay well I gotta stop I'm right there

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Highly innovative games I'm sorry

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Your remake of centipede

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
What is it the last the one that came out

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
In the fall

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Last year it's terrible

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
And not innovative in the least and

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
What test drive Ferrari

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
That's innovative to the you know test

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Drive franchise I'm sorry

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
That's not true this is a

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Slippery slope though because like I

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I want to say okay yeah I

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Get it we see these knockoff games

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
On the iOS devices and especially

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Android stuff all the time but

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Where do you draw the line because if you think

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
About it couldn't any

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Shoot them up game any

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
First person shooter couldn't anything

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Come back to combat

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
If you really think about it

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Well like see I have a problem with

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
The fact that you know okay it's a vector

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Game that has tanks in it I'm sorry

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
But even I think in the arcades they had

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
More than just battle zone I remember

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I remember an awesome

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
PC game awesome awesome PC

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Game called specter that was

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Like a vector tank game but it was

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It was not I mean

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
It was not battle zone like

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It was a step I remember the big thing about it

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Is you could do modem play and all this stuff which was huge

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
You know when I was growing up and the whole reason

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
They're doing this of course is because

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Because they have their own games that they're

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Releasing on the iOS marketplace

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
And that's what it really comes down to I think

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Is that they just want to release it and

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Actually get some money for it but

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I mean let's be

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Serious here you know like Arkanoid

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
And stuff like that I mean which Arkanoid isn't really

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
There's actually was it Breakout

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Taito was

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
But Breakout I mean that's

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Pretty much like Arkanoid

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Well Arkanoid is just a souped up

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Version of Breakout if you will

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
It's got the falling things that you pick up

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
That change the paddle

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I would say that that's more of like a genre

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Of games now less

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Of a you know because

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
It kind of goes back to saying well

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
You know there's fighting games

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
And they're all clones of Street Fighter

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Well it's a genre now

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
It's not necessarily yeah a lot of

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Stuff you know is inspired by

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Or is a clone of something and then they

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Kind of throw their own unique spin on it and there's

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
That or there's the

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Games that are on the iOS a lot

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Of games out there that there's guys

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Trying to make a quick buck and they put some with the Angry Birds

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Characters they literally rip the assets

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
From the game and then they create something else

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Or you know something that's like it's

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Angry cats and then there's dogs or something

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Or you just you know to the point where

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
That's a rip off don't the masses

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Kind of know how to tell a cheap rip

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Off though well the masses do but see

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
It reminds me of those

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
CDs they sell at Target for like

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
$5 that are like you know

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Top 40 hits and all it is it's like

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Really bad cover songs

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Of the stuff that's on the radio right now

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
But like a lot of it

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Though it's kind of like

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
One of those things you they have to try to

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Protect their rights or they lose their rights

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
You know it so they kind

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Of have to do this but at the same time

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I think the reason they're doing this is because they're putting games

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Up on the iOS you know platform

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
That you know

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I mean they recently released updated

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Versions of Breakout and Asteroids

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
So I mean maybe that's why

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
They're doing it but

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
I mean okay

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I can't fault them for trying to do that

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And let's be honest there's a lot of shit

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
On the app store that's

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Fucking just ripping off

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
All sorts of shit I mean there's a ton

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Of rip off games out there

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
And there's a ton of games inspired by

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Stuff like I would say Vector Tanks

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Is probably

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Somewhat you know

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Original game I mean yeah

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
It's inspired by the old vector graphics

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
And maybe inspired by Battlezone but it's not

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Like they're not calling it Tank Zone

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
And you know it has you know basically

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
All the same gameplay as Battlezone

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I just

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I don't know I think that

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
They should be going out through the right people but they're

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Going out through everybody instead

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
And at the same time why aren't the people there

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Making the Mario games and shit like that

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
You know getting that stuff taken down

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
To turn this a 180

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
A little bit this is what really worries

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Me about SOPA and that whole thing

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
And why you know people are really scared

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Because if you allow corporations

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
To kind of draw the line they're gonna draw

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
It too far in the sand one way

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Oh they're gonna take out everything

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
It's gonna be crazy

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
If something like that actually passes

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
You know I mean and all this

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Stuff that we see is just evidence of that

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Because Atari may overreach

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
In trying to protect

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Their stuff and who's to say

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
You know other companies do you trust

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
A lot of these companies to draw the line

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Of course and here's

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
A funny thing too like say for example

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I make a game or something that's pretty

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Original and I release it out there

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
And Atari goes

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
And I consider ripping

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Off some of my ideas

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Or something like that and that's not necessarily because they do that

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
This game is too much like Custer's Revenge

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
That Loki made and so

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
We have the rights to this game

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Even though it was really a third party

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Let's say for example

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Here's an example that's not necessarily accurate

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
But

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Was it the ferret tossing game

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Let's just say the ferret tossing game comes out

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
And it's too much like

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Defender with the whole

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Scrolling left and right

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Too much like Defender or okay

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
That's a bad example let's just say

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Say I release the game out there

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
And all of a sudden you know Atari comes out

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Or not even necessarily Atari just some company

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Comes out and you know a major

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Company and puts out a game

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
On iOS or something like that it's very

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Similar to my game like as far as all the

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Original aspects of that game it's very

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Similar to that I myself

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Go to Apple and say hey I want

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
You to take this down are they gonna

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Do it probably not because this

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Major company that you know has a

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Lot more money invested into the app

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Store than I do and they're just probably gonna

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Ignore what I say yet if

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Apple comes and says hey we don't like

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Ferret tossing or whatever like that

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Even though it

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Vaguely resembles something that they may have done

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
They will take it down without

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Who's gonna know where to draw the line

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Nobody is that

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Do you trust the government to draw the line

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Do you think senators

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
And all them play video games

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
I think one senator came out and said

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Well a lot of my staff does play Mortal Combat

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Like that was the most

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Video game keen thing I've ever heard

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
No it was a

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Justice it was that

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Court case about the

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
ESA versus

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
The California law and all that that's where that

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Came out well I think you know to be honest I have

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
A problem with you know if a lot of the

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
People in government that

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
They don't play games I mean honestly

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
That's

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I understand that not everybody

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Plays games out there but I would

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I would assume nowadays that the vast majority

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Of the populace plays games in some

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Form or another not necessarily console

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Games but at least on the internet you know the

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Occasional

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Phone game or something like that

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
And if these people representing us

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Don't have any fucking clue about

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
What's going on out there

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
They just don't care they'd be like well I don't

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Watch TV so why should I protect the rights of the

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
People that want to watch TV I mean

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
That's just not good

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
We need to get these people out

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Anyhow tangent sorry about that but it's

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Important it's kind of stuff that's going on

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Right now anyhow

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Kind of going in a completely different direction here

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
We mentioned earlier in the show that it

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Is kind of a slow release period there's not a lot

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Of games coming out until closer to the end of the month

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Of course you know Final Fantasy 13 2

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
It's slow release like B12

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Yes but one game

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
If a certain Best Buy store

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Is to be believed might just come out of nowhere

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
And steal the spotlight for this first quarter and that's

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Diablo 3 according

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
To Best Buy

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And this is again to be fair

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
It's not the whole damn corporation it's one store

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
That apparently was in Minnesota

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Where the Twitter user was

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That had a standee that said Diablo 3

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Midnight opening available for

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Purchase 1201 AM on February

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
1st as the launch day and

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
February by the way was spelled wrong

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Well there's been this whole

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Was it missing an R? There's this whole back

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
F-E-B-U-R

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Instead of R-U

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
February yeah which granted

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
February's a tricky word is probably one of the more

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Common misspelled words but still

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Clearly not an official Blizzard

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Product if that's the case

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Now there was this whole back and forth that went on

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
A UK retailer

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Kind of clarified the date too

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And showed a February 3rd date

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
And then there was this whole

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Other back and forth where the Best Buy

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Was actually called by the gaming

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Press and that the sign was

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Actually taken down and then

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Bashyok one of the community

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Managers over at Blizzard actually said on

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Twitter lol

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
We can't stop shops from doing whatever they want

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
To do I'm paraphrasing here

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
But retailers will find out when the rest of you do

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Basically when it's in an official

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Press release but certainly there's a lot of back

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
And forth going on about the release date

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Loki you're on the inside a little bit

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
You're shaking your head over there and then there's

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Micah Whipple

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
That's Bashyok

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
No they have not announced an official date yet

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
You'll know when they do

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
And I said this on Hoard House

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I truly think

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
First off if they're going to street date something it's going to be on a Tuesday

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
And not a Wednesday

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
It's going to be March 27th

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
The very last day of the quarter that they could do it

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I said

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I firmly believe that

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Because at this point with all the auction house back and forth that's been going on

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
And that beta is still going

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
They're going to want plenty of time for people

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
To be able to pre-order

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Get those in and it's going to be carefully

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Timed with the Blizzard blood pact

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
For Warcraft and the fact that

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
You're going to have these

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Probably a million people getting it for free

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Because they're committed to WoW

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
And they're going to drop it at a time where

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
It's going to distract them from WoW

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Because nothing is going on in WoW

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
So I think end of March is reasonable

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
And they're also going to be starting

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Their marketing campaign which will be massive

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
And so

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
One month lead time is not enough

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
So you will be

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
You'll bet your ass that

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
And know about it way before it comes out

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Says, why do we have

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
All this secret release date stuff?

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Just tell people, it's silly

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
It's not secret, it's the fact that it's not done yet

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It's, Diablo 3 is fucking done

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It's fucking done and the problem is

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
It has to do with the whole, it's the auction house thing

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
That's getting tied up in Korea is part of it

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
And now they're using this as an excuse

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
To put more into the game

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Which is yet to be revealed

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
But I think a lot of this is to

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Make sure that legally that auction house thing

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Gets clearance in all the countries

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I honestly believe that, I think this game should have been out

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Last year and I think they were going to announce it

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
At Blizzcon for a December release

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
And change their tune when Korea happened

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
So, we'll see

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Virtual M in our chatroom says

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
The website does list it as February 1st

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
If you go to bestbuy.com

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
But placeholder dates are super common, right?

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
It's probably, if I remember correctly

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
The last update we got from them

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Was Q1 2012

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
And that's kind of an

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
You just place a placeholder date

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Usually, like, I used to put it on a weird date

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Like a Saturday or something like that in our system

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
So that, you know, I know it's a placeholder date

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
But yeah, there's no date for it yet

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
In fact, from

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Yeah, I'm

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
I'm 100% sure there's not an official date for it yet

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Although I haven't gotten an update from Activision in a while

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
So probably next time I get it, you know

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Well, rumors are it could

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
The release, the news of a release date

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Could be coming out

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Next week, as early as next week

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
But I think a lot of that's wishful thinking

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
On the community and how sometimes

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
That snowballs into, oh, this is news now

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
So, we'll see

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Probably what it was is a store jumped a gun

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And they built some, you know

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
POP for the store

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And plus, if, and Virtual M says

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
The website lists it as this

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
That's actually, Virtual M probably just explained

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Where the issue came from

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Best Buy didn't get that date from

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
From Blizzard

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
They got it from themselves

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Probably in their own system

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
And the store manager was like, oh, we gotta make sales for this

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Let's get a sign made up

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
And we're gonna push more sales of this

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And it's February 1st in our system right here

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Props to them for being, you know

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Way to take initiative, but at the same time

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
You need to spell

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Alright

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Let's move on to Dark Soccer

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
With some other gaming news

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
This is not a rumor

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Not a rumor

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's about

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Kaz Harai

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Guess what? He's being promoted

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
To president of Sony

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
That was actually put up by Nikkei

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
By the Japanese Stock Exchange

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
He's going to be replacing

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Howard Stringer

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
The theory is

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
By April

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It should be going on, but they have to finish everything

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Through a board meeting

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And Stringer is staying on as

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
The chairman and CEO

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Yeah, we get a lot more

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Ridge Racer and

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Giant Enemy Crafts

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
But man

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Sony's kind of in

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Relatively crappy shape

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Well, first off

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Let me play this and then we'll come back

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
In honor of Kaz Harai ascending to the throne

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
At the top of Sony

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I think we have to play our very favorite clip

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
From 2006

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Please welcome Kaz Harai

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Ridge Racer

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
The essence of the PlayStation DNA

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Is real change

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And the consumers are ready

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Genji 2

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Is an Ashen game

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Which is based on Japanese history

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Ridge Racer

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Being based on history

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
The stages of the game

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Will also be based on famous battles

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Which actually took place

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
In ancient Japan

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
So here's this giant enemy crab

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Ridge Racer

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And you

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Attack its weak point

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
For massive damage

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
It's Ridge Racer

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Ridge Racer

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
PlayStation 3 will retail for

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
$599

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
$599

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
$599

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Giant Enemy Crab

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
$599

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
$599

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
It's Ridge Racer

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Ridge Racer

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Don't forget old. That's Makah45

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
On YouTube by the way

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That has that clip up there

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I gotta, I gotta put this out there though

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
There's actually a reason why

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I play that clip

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Because it does tie in all this

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
It's not on the show role tonight

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
But this story makes me think about

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
How there's all of those news about the Vita

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Over in Japan

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
is exhibitionally not doing well

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Like to the point, this was on Yahoo.News

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Where I saw this, so we're

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
pretty, you know, mainstream site

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.960
they're saying the Vita is bombing because the PSP outsold it in Japan last

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.800
week so in other words that's pretty bad they sold more PSP's last week and they

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.040
have the sales numbers to back it up that doesn't bode well for the Vita

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:57.000
however look at that clip this is just history repeating itself all over again

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.800
isn't it well it's too expensive the games are you know well you know hit

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.440
miss I gotta well I gotta give them credit there is a lot of interesting

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.160
stuff and I think a lot of people are really turned off by the price right now

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.440
and in some ways I kind of see history repeating itself here I don't think I

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.480
would write off the Vita as a horrific failure yet I mean it hasn't launched

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.800
here in the US for one I don't know if it's gonna I think it'll sell more than

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.160
PSP's do in the same week but I yeah I there's nothing I but I think the 3ds

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.520
is gonna stare is nothing coming out for the PSP nothing I mean okay one game but

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:38.240
it's it's a visual novel if I can also point out something last fiscal quarter

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:45.480
Sony lost 1.6 billion yen which is about 20 million dollars or 13 million pounds

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.680
so I mean I but but in my age well you never know like the PlayStation 3

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.320
everybody gave it shit in the beginning everybody gave it shit but it's come a

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.200
long way and right now you know especially with everything we were

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.160
saying with Microsoft at the top of the show PlayStation 3 is it's a pretty good

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.680
system right now you know it really depends on the games you want the

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.000
exclusives and all that but it's it's a worthy competitor the Xbox 360 I don't

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.540
think anybody would have said that in 2006 and honestly I think we're like the

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:16.560
3ds and stuff I don't see them squeezing out a lot more power out of that system

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.040
then the stuff that's out right now I mean sure there's gonna be some games

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.040
that look pretty nice and can do a little bit more but if 3d is all they

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.160
got I mean if you don't like the 3d you got a DS I mean that's pretty much it

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.640
I'm not being a defenseless or a defensive or whatever or being a fanboy

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.560
but I am saying hold on a minute because you know although I will great yes that

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.880
looks very bad that the PSP was out selling the Vita but didn't I could be

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.920
wrong but didn't the same thing happen with 3ds at first where eventually a

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.120
couple months later the older DS was we're out selling the 3ds and now look

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.980
where the 3ds is yeah I mean all it took was a few powerhouse games and now that

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:55.200
nobody's joking about the 3ds everybody's like within a matter of months

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.880
everybody's like okay yeah 3ds here to stay I mean no happening no one's

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.440
arguing that the fact that the 3d the 3ds launch versus the Vita launch I

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.320
mean the launch games are way better on the Vita there's actually stuff that

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.960
people would like on there I'm probably not gonna get one at launch because it

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.960
is too damn expensive and honestly I I don't I don't play my 3ds enough I mean

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.280
fuck I've only played Super Mario 3d land once and I'm not gonna buy a new

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.600
system game guru in our chat room says well yeah 3ds stole Monster Hunter which

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.480
is what everyone bought the PSP for in Japan so you know that those few key

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.680
games can really sell a system I mean you cannot deny that Mario 3d land and

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.040
Mario Kart 7 is the reason why 3ds nobody's you know joking about it

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:45.480
anymore and Monster Hunter in Japan certainly mm-hmm you know so anyhow all

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:52.400
right so cause her I I mean it'll these things happen you know but don't buy

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.920
Ridge Racer do not buy Ridge Racer for the Vita if you're going to buy a game

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.440
for the Vita I seriously if you're trying to buy a cheap game if you're

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.000
looking to buy a cheap game from Namco by touch my katamari because that's 30

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.680
bucks and you get a full game versus 30 bucks and get three tracks and five cars

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.620
all my eyes and chat says but Sony doesn't have a system seller like Mario

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:18.120
or Mario Kart they do have uncharted which is pretty big deal over here they

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.680
have uncharted they have wiped out if you like wipe out they have well hot

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:28.140
shots golf actually did pretty well in Japan it's not right I won't wipe out on

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:32.440
the same level as Mario Kart I really wouldn't it's not at launch but well

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.320
they have Modination Racers that's a launch title but that on the same level

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:40.260
as Mario Kart I'm like Sony's big within our God of War uncharted well within a

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:45.960
month a little big planet that that'll be big yeah luminous for me and and

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.320
third-party games luminous I don't see as a launch sales well I haven't gotten

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.680
Ubisoft updates yet but I haven't seen any there to launch stuff but in third

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.020
party stuff I mean you've got ninja Ninja Gaiden Sigma I mean that's a

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:04.480
pretty hardcore game ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 blaze blue extent or blaze blue

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:15.280
continuum shift extent there's the MMA game from 505 supremacy MMA I know

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:21.400
there's a FIFA game and you know Ridge Racer touch my katamari which looks

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.080
pretty good there's a lot of good games it's it's not like where huh well let's

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:32.440
see there's Nintendogs and a submarine game oh and pilot wings steel diver all

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.040
right Rama in our chat says if Sony knocked the price of the Vita down to

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.160
$1.99 they wouldn't need a system seller per se that maybe losing a lot of money

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.080
yeah that's I guess that's true but don't isn't it common to lose money on

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.320
systems you make it back up with the games yes the Vita the Vita does have a

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.200
lot that's not just games that's another thing you know it does have strengths in

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.360
just like the PSP had the web browser had the mp3s people call into the show

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:01.360
on their PSPs I mean you know let's see ah my eyes agree is true if they knock

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.920
the price down to $1.99 I would buy it and Yuki follows it up with same so the

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.480
price is yeah they're not gonna lose $100 in every system I mean that's just

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.360
stupid I mean it's stupid but at the same time I think it's fucking retarded

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.680
that I've got to buy another memory card that doesn't come with the system I mean

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.960
help the original PSP I think came with a 32 megabyte memory card I agree that

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.440
if they wanted to get they would put a small memory card in yeah like I really

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.120
need to even half not even half a gig but like let's do a 1 gig card I mean

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.000
those things cannot be the price to manufacture that they're charging I

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.440
don't think they would be taking a big loss by throwing one in and I think

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.880
they were really sweet in the pot because I sir I kid you not every single

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.760
one of those games requires a memory card and so here's here's a fun

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.760
situation I go buy a Vita and they're sold out of memory cards fuck I can't

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.280
play anything all right we got to move on we're running long in part a let's

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.520
move on with some more news Loki it's just like a great plan right there I

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:05.280
guess what apparently there's some insiders that say that there's going to

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:11.520
be the new unveiling of a new Xbox and new PlayStation this e3 and they

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.040
apparently have it from a very very very very very very very very reliable source

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.800
and this is MCV reporting this as well that both of their these new consoles

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.840
boom will be making their debut at e3 I'm not surprised I'm not sure if

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.440
obviously though that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna be out

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.840
this year or even next year I mean it could be I could see him coming out

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.680
maybe fall next year I call bull on this story because I I would believe the Xbox

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.560
I I think it's about time for the Xbox to show off their next console but I

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.360
don't think PlayStation 4 I don't think we need it yet I feel like PlayStation

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.720
3 took so long to get to its prime I I almost kind of believed the whole 10

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.520
year cycle thing I think I think PlayStation 4 coming out this this soon

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:04.520
is showing it this year I don't know I I Rob I think it's it's a Vita they've

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.640
got to push the Vita they've got to push that through the holiday you don't

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.240
understand though Rob a 10-year cycle doesn't necessarily mean that boom after

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.560
10 years they would launch a new console it means that they launch a new console

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.920
and it overlaps for three years I just III in my gut you know just says they

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.600
either can't be the PlayStation 4 this early it's just too damn early for the

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.400
PlayStation 4 it's a reliable source so it's so reliable the stories in the

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:37.280
reliability I mean it's so reliable I want to get their quote because it was

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.400
it was hilarious

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:46.560
ah nope don't have the quote oh well there's one guy's like I can guarantee

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.440
it a hundred percent it's gonna be there you know it's gonna be there the Wii U

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.880
and my disappointment actually you know what I'd be interested easy with this

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.760
what's gonna happen next week during you know the whole cuz CES stuff CES is

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.240
never really gaming I mean well no it was gonna be there with the Wii U yeah

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.040
but they swear up and down it's just the same the exact same thing they showed at

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:14.160
e3 for people who weren't able to wait in that horrifically long line yeah and

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.600
I don't think they need to I mean CES really isn't a gaming show what the

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.480
biggest game news I can think of that ever came out of CES was the Microsoft

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.000
Game Room was a big thing that came out it and unfortunately Microsoft Game Room

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.080
didn't last which is such don't get me on that game room had so much freaking

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.800
potential and now it's like ruined it for everything else like I'm just I'm so

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.560
mad about game room because it could have been so much more awesome and

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:47.160
really should have been but anyway no I think I think the big things Windows 8

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.400
you know you'll see more stuff about PC and in bigger TVs and 3d TVs and all

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.600
that I don't I don't think it's a lot about gaming consoles you might see

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.320
little things especially from Microsoft and the 360 because they're really

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.840
trying to make the 360 this whole like centerpiece I think they're gonna be

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:09.000
showing off some new channels and if you want to take a total shot in the dark

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.080
maybe something akin to the one versus 100 thing getting out some type of some

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.280
type of entertainment channel how you dig into those channels because I've

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.440
stopped downloading them because I just don't give a shit about them anymore

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.560
they're they're kind of pointless I hate to say it the only one I could ever see

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.200
myself using is that maybe I would use I heart radio if I was hosting a party

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.440
because there are some decent stations on there with very few commercials some

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.600
of the HD simulcasts you know that play like dance music or comedy on loop it's

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.400
kind of like having the satellite radio that's the one that I'm kind of like I

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.600
could see myself using this but the rest not really I don't know it that whole I

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.680
don't like the new interface to be honest it's just oh yeah I hate the

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.340
interface but that doesn't mean I don't like the point of some of the channels

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:58.880
and the Netflix channel certainly although actually I I find it better on

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.320
my ps3 so I used to think now the other we have the technology where we could I

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:09.640
don't know select the interface we want thought maybe hmm I'll be nice we have

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.320
the technology we can select it all right well speaking of rumors there are

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.880
some rumors about the really good Fleetwood Mac album there are some

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.880
rumors about the Xbox lube because remember that's what we're calling it

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.800
now if you don't know why we're calling the new Xbox system the Xbox lube you

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.520
have to go back and listen to some old episodes but apparently the Xbox lube is

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:34.240
supposed to be this sounds really slick it's supposed to be a DVR as well okay

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.560
that makes it worthwhile this is according to some patents that are

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.700
floating around out there that apparently on December 27th the US

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:44.360
patent office gave Microsoft a patent for a device that would be a game

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.040
console and a DVR a digital video recorder application running alongside a

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.800
television client component allows users to record media content on the gaming

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.600
console the DVR application also integrates itself with the console menu

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.720
once integrated users can record media content while playing games

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.320
alternatively users can record content when the gaming console is turned off

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:07.280
the recorded content can include television programming gaming experience

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.880
whether local or online interesting music DVDs and so on when in the

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.600
recording state users can also switch between various other media modes whether

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.520
gaming television and so on I would rather I think this would be more

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.800
something that would be integrated into a television set or integrated into a

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.040
Cosep top box that would be from a cable provider here's my other thing I mean

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.920
although I could certainly see this being feasible for the next system why

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.840
does it have to be the next system isn't it feasible they could release a 360

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.600
that has a DVR built in they could do that but I mean I think that by saying

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:45.120
it's in their next thing that makes it a selling point true true I mean it is the

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.720
kind of the big a big thing but I that's the type of thing really how well did

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:55.360
HD player hypothetically let's say it was in the 360 that I could see coming

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:00.000
out of CES but here's I think dark soccer it's gonna be the next it's never

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.080
I'm telling you it's never gonna happen on its own it's gonna be something from

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.440
a cable provider because why are they the cable providers are hey we're

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.880
providing content to you and you're gonna offer a DVR so now we can't charge

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.600
people that fee the cost to rent the DVR system out you know and and they don't

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:21.320
have to buy our you know our higher tier programs to get a you know DVR you're

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.840
gonna pull this shit on us fuck that we want some of that money so that's not

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.440
gonna happen they're gonna put that shit out themselves and it's gonna be kind of

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.360
like hey you can get Comcast and you get a game player as well you know a Comcast

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.800
box and you get games and you can do all this stuff or it's gonna be integrated

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.720
into a TV you know something like that because I'm telling you they're not

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.200
gonna I mean I I would love it it'd be great you know if we could have a DVR

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.880
because then I can DVR shit without having to pay my cable writer to do it

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.640
but I just don't see that happening it's kind of a pipe dream I mean there's

01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:00.680
Divix or not Divix there's TiVo but you know who fuck uses TiVo anymore yeah you

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.640
got some support in chat room Loki a lot of folks agree with you Derek H says

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.760
Loki is correct I think he's saying it about this I don't know because of the

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.240
delay there's like a minute delay but Rama in the chat says the console is a

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.600
DVR will cause a problem because cable providers will not support it you're

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.320
right there are cable providers in agreement with Xbox Comcast our local one

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.560
is supposed to come on board in early 2012 because if you think about that

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.320
will be shown at CES for sure like if I can if I can DVR like whatever I can DVR

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.960
X show or whatever you know it can do like let's just say I can set it up like

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.640
a TV you know like I can set it up okay I want to record season of this why would

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.240
I buy the content off of their service I mean because I already DVR did I mean

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.640
they're losing sales that way they're not gonna do that I mean come on they're

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.680
gonna lock that shit out and so it's gonna either come from them or it's

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:55.080
gonna cost something to you know do that yeah I'm I could see where it's gonna

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.000
cost Microsoft points to DVR stuff you know it well and I wouldn't say it's

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.240
necessarily in costume to do so maybe you need a membership or something I

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.360
don't even know if you need members it's got to come from the cable provider it's

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.920
it's seriously that's something that would be like okay because now they have

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.880
these partnerships with these cable companies and stuff where you can do all

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.560
this on the man crap it's got to be something that's coming from them like a

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.240
new set top box what if it just worked with over-the-air TV though I mean

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.360
remember you can hook an antenna to your TV and these magical channels and it

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.140
works fantastic I can tune in zero channel it depends on where you live in

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:34.760
your connection it's it's terrible I need like a big old retro in order well

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:40.520
no they don't look like that anymore now they're like square they're I mean

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.000
seriously I I tried to hooking one up to I was like yeah I'm gonna put this up

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.680
I'm gonna get on my HDTV for free it worked like crap I got nothing not even

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.320
a Spanish channel that came in correctly although when I was programming it

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.440
actually got worse every time I tried to find stations all right listen I

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.760
actually have to say to be perfectly honest I have no use for DVR I don't

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.040
watch TV Dan doesn't watch TV everything that we watch is streamed I was to say

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:13.280
BBC America maybe I Supernatural on CW I download my shows on the internet

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.920
because I hate commercials mm-hmm and besides that you know the commercials

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.640
are what provide your free television I don't watch the TV I mean Dan the only

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:29.840
shows that he watches is like Sons of Anarchy and Top Gear and guess what he

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.560
streams them from other places we were I mean we're paying for cable we rarely

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.200
use we'd actually downgraded our TV cable and upgraded our internet cable

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.560
see I'm thinking about it but then then that'll be when the next season of

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.760
RuPaul's Drag Race starts it's like I gotta have logo I can't wait till the

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:53.080
next day gotta have it you could well I cannot sashay away my cable is that by

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.840
the time it airs at its normal time someone's already uploaded it from an

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.200
eat from the East Coast showing I got friends that'll spoil Drag Race so then

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:07.360
five minutes of it airing on my Facebook anyhow all right I'll just let's move on

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:14.800
with some more news Dark Sakura I'm not a hipster I'm just hip anyway so media

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.760
molecule is spending a lot of money and it's on new stuff they're actually

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:27.480
trying to innovate wait it's not LittleBigPlanet 3 they basically they're

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:34.720
trying not to rely on LittleBigPlanet as their primary you know safety net if if

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:41.800
you will they are trying to actually expand into different audiences so

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.000
they've been spending about and this is from a British news source they're

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:53.200
spending about three point forty four million pounds well that's how much

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:57.520
profit that they made in 2011 but they're spending four point one million

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.520
on research and development so they're keep trying to put their resources into

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:07.000
new kinds of games to keep innovating so that they don't have to just rely on

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.440
LittleBigPlanet to keep them around because I mean I think it's really smart

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:16.160
too because you know say that you've got a company that's good for just one thing

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.240
and that's all they've been doing but after a while the franchise is stale

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:25.400
because I honestly think LittleBigPlanet before too long is gonna hit that place

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.200
where people are gonna expect the same thing and there's not gonna be able to

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.960
pay but for them to put much new into it I think a big problem is it's it's more

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.120
I mean LittleBigPlanet is really a limitless game there's so much you can

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.440
do with it but I think it's the saturation that's gonna be an issue and

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.920
that's not really on media molecule but it's like you know you have your PSP

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.760
version and your Vita version and you're you know it's it's coming out on

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.600
everything well here's a quote on here they say that their investments are

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.560
going into and this is the quote leading edge physics and dynamics rapid world

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.840
creation from laser data innovative routes to marketing no to market via

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.200
web-based interfaces 3d stereo optics for advanced simulation and use of high

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:09.120
def data capture and processing techniques hmm so it looks like just

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:15.720
from what I can seeing on here they're trying to branch out but try to work on

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.360
stuff it sounds like they're really working on immersion they're making the

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.120
holodeck basically they are making a holiday at clay station holodeck they're

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:30.560
trying to make it where I think it's not just they're extending to immerse but

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.720
they're actually trying to draw in your feedback into the game to make it

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.900
customizable into whatever they're working on Derek H in our chat room at

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:42.720
chat dot orange laundry calm says 1.5 million to find new games come on that's

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.240
just another way to write hookers and blow I don't think so perhaps you know

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:52.320
that's just kind of I would buy a game hookers and blow which especially if

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.520
it's that whole 3d immersive experience like you know you see her nose that's

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:02.720
about to snort the cocaine just jumping right out of the TV I want man horse

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.040
then you need to play Saints for the third all right somebody would lend it

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:12.280
to me alright I could play it I just lazy let's move on and travel the world

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:17.280
with some release dates and Loki start us off with the u.s. although I don't

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.440
like last week there was literally nothing so I don't know if this week's

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:26.400
the same thing but uh yeah there's pretty much nothing um this week there

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:36.760
is well not much I believe my pet puppy 3d from five five games I want to say

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:43.960
that I got laid I can't honestly well here I will get you the definitive list

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:50.160
here okay but yeah I seriously it was like nothing I think was actually this

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:58.040
week we had like three releases of some UMD games hmm there were from well that

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:10.280
was actually like this week but um let's see coming out this week ah yes there is

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:14.120
pretty much nothing so let's start off with four and one action pack from South

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.600
Beach games it's four games that were featured on the PlayStation Network and

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:27.280
they're all terrible including mushroom wars digger wave wave was it a

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:37.400
smash cars and wakeboarding HD all for 20 bucks so I mean that's pretty good

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:43.800
right national geographic challenge for PlayStation 3 as well this week and that

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:49.400
is it those are the two games you can expect this week except I bet you

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.360
anything foreign one action-packed doesn't come out this week so maybe one

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.600
game that's all you get and they're all terrible uh yeah well I mean I don't

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.840
know if they're absolutely I'm looking forward to mushroom wars because they're

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:08.640
for five bucks I mean for five bucks a game I mean that's not bad I mean I

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.160
would think this is no one's looking for this game in the series so instead of

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:18.240
being diarrhea it's just solid poop stop all right let's move to the Japanese

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.960
release dates it's a there's at least a couple things this week in Japan on the

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.880
PlayStation 3 there's a game called time leap coming out I'm not sure what time

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:31.000
leap is of course I want to think time crisis but it's actually time leap is a

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.160
romance dating game yeah I've played one of those really animates the characters

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.600

it's crushed it did it crush three days crushed I don't care done our release

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.800
dates have been crushed all right just a couple more news stories for you guys

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.680
in the classic game of the week you know we kind of sounded like what was that

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:04.680
anime club thing I didn't even watch that I watched it because of John and I

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.920
was like you know what was said is that I know people like that all right low

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:13.240
key so there's been some or there's gonna be some changes coming to Xbox

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:20.280
Live indie games this includes that they've now allowed people to you know

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:26.160
increase the file size of games from 150 megabytes to a new maximum of 500

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.200
megabytes and also they've removed I guess the restriction that all games

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.800
exceeding 50 megabytes in size were required to be priced at either $3 or

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.280
$5 making them hard to position I guess against Xbox Live arcade games but now

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.960
the minimum price has been reduced to $1 or 80 Microsoft points all across the

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:51.800
board so now you can see a lot more $1 games which is awesome and then of

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.760
course they've also raised the number of caps of titles that any developer is

01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.160
allowed to host on Xbox Live indie games originally it was 10 now they can have a

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:07.240
total of 20 games at a time so neat I guess of course none of the changes that

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:11.000
they made have made it easier to find Xbox Live indie games on the actual

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.520
service so that's too bad we'll be posting lots of direct links when bungee

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.960
ferret tossing comes out which now with the expanded space I'm expecting Aaron

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.400
to include video clips of ferrets and clips from our show and I'm just kidding

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:31.600
he can do whatever seriously you need to get some of that ferret b-roll you need

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:35.920
to be able to put in the Konami code and just get get actual videos of ferrets

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:43.600
would be great ferret b-roll and it plays the Benny Hill theme oh wait that

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.200
would be copyright stuff maybe there's like maybe there's like one of those

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:51.600
really bad music free free things that sounds like the Benny Hill theme but

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.840
it's not yeah it's something alright I was suggesting from the kitchen that it

01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.720
be played backwards alright one other story for you guys before the classic

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.080
game of the week we were talking about the Vita a minute ago and oh you know

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.400
the old saying on this show hackers gonna hack so how long did it take the

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.600
did Sony ever claimed that the Vita was unhackable was that claim ever made I

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.320
don't think they did this time no I think they just assumed yeah well it's

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:21.720
been done the Vita's already been hacked and the first thing that's been running

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:28.000
on it Genesis games yay Linux not a bad idea Sonic and knuckle why are you

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.920
cheering not Linux because I'm kind of getting I see the quintessential thing

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.040
is to install Linux yes when you when you hack the system you put Linux on it

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.680
write your hello world program I'm sure I'm sure someone did that but this is

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.160
something that people will want to download and use a lot of as the Genesis

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.760
games on the PlayStation Vita Sonic and knuckles now apparently running on the

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:55.360
PlayStation Vita it's been out less than a month apparently it's a homebrew

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:59.880
Genesis emulator that was originally built for the PSP it's running on the

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:05.400
Vita's PSP emulator yes that's right it's an emulator emulating an emulator

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:16.240
emulating a Sega blast process and I've gone cross-eyed so there you go Sony apparently

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.840
has put in some security that is going to meet that exploit moot as soon as it

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.520
is made available according to the video's uploader but how long is that

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.700
gonna last watch the PSP they patch new exploit they patch new exploit watch the

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:33.720
Wii they patch new exploit they patch new exploit and then they just forget

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.680
the patch and the cycle continues at some point they just say fuck it all

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.840
right remember back in the day when you didn't hack your no because you were

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:47.920
playing a Genesis if I hacked it I used an axe remember when you actually were

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:51.800
playing Sonic enough Sonic and knuckles on an actual Genesis what like two weeks

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:57.200
ago so so do we here at orange lounge radio we like to revisit the classic

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.800
games in a segment we call the classic game of the week every week dark soccer

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:06.520
dives into the vault and now she brings a little piece of it over because it's

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:09.320
not down the hall anymore yeah so she brings a little piece of the vault with

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:13.480
her in a segment we call the classic game of the week dark soccer what should

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:19.600
the kiddies be playing this week in America it was known as Rastan in Japan

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:25.240
and England it was called Rastan saga ooh it was put up by Taito and he played

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:29.720
a barbarian beaten shit up let's have some of that music Rob roll that

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:40.080
beautiful bean footage I've been hearing this game music play endlessly because

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.760
Dan has decided he's on a Rastan kick and has been watching video playthroughs

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:51.040
of Rastan we turn down the audio there so we can hear you yeah so much Rastan

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:57.040
anyway so it's sort of inspired by Greek mythology so you've got monsters coming

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:04.200
out and you have to beat them up with your sword or an axe or hammers some of

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:07.680
the weapons are also jewels and you get shields and mantles you also can get a

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.720
goat's head I think it gives you a one-up or something was it an

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:19.120
advertisement for God of War maybe like seeing into the future um anyway as far

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:25.760
as the background got graphics for the arcade version you actually had sunlight

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:30.400
effects and it was fairly innovative for its time like look at the background on

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.280
that video for a minute mm-hmm make sure that you send a link of that Toronto for

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:40.080
our tumbler okay oh I forgot Rama was queen of the tumbler now yes

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:43.880
congratulations on your promotion I have a hard time hitting the tumbler on my

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:50.640
little dinky notebook listeners get Jamie laptop I'm getting no no no you can use

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.760
that guy that rock over there that Alan was using that's okay I want anyone

01:32:54.760 --> 01:33:01.160
anyway um with the Japanese version actually did get a full dedicated

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:05.240
cabinet but the North American and European ones never did there's rakit

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:09.840
conversions so you could convert an existing cabinet to whatever the kit was

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:16.800
you had any buttons joysticks decals marquees blah blah blah blah blah also

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:23.340
the opening to the story as what's on this particular version it was not

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:29.760
included in any versions but the Japanese version so here is sort of in

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.320
a nutshell I'm just gonna read from the article here the game explains that he

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.280
would be given all the treasures of an empire in exchange for a terrible

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:44.360
dragon's head and when you beat a stage or the rounds as they're called you

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:49.680
actually get a victory screen that goes with the storyline in the American

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.640
version there's just sort of the generic story you were a warrior you cleared

01:33:53.640 --> 01:34:00.600
this crap hooray for you here's some money and some bitches it kind of the

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:05.280
opening scene I have to say makes me think of Conan you know the end of the

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.320
movie when he's sitting on his throne but that is another story he also just

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.680
looks like Conan yeah I mean you know this was the 80s the whole barbarian

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:18.680
thing was totally rocking on you know and I believe that this came out in I

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:28.280
want to say 87 don't quote me yet as far as the ports that came out there were

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:34.280
there's a Sega Master System version which I've got they actually had decent

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:38.200
music believe it or not the master system had pretty decent music there's

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:43.520
an MSX version a game give version in 91 oh for the record the Master System and

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:50.320
MSX versions came out in 88 there was a PC one in 1990 Commodore 64 version in

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:58.640
1987 a spectrum version 87 CPC version in 88 an Apple to GS in 1990 and the

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:04.440
Commodore 64 version the game was impossible to finish Rob what how did

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:08.640
they manage that had a bug in the game yikes the bug would prevent a player for

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.680
making a particular jump from one platform to the other he would always

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:16.080
fall short I could never make it across I don't remember that I mean I didn't

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:21.880
play this game on 64 but that's that's uh that's got to be irritating to say

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:27.120
least well for anyone who wants to play it now there is it was included in title

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.840
legends with ps2 and Xbox and PC in 2006 which funny enough is how I played this

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:40.440
game I do have title legends so didn't you get it for free no what it no that

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:44.160
was the year that you bought it when the title thing was going on it yeah I know

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.120
that was the gaming if you're thinking classic gaming Expo was the Midway

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.280
arcade treasures that was it because I batted my eyes and I flirted with a

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:55.880
Midway lady yeah okay so anyway who was very nice I'm very sad to see the

01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.800
Midways no more well there were two sequels there was a game called Rastan

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:06.760
saga 2 that came out as nastar in Europe and nastar warrior in North America and

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:14.680
then warrior blade Rastan saga episode 3 there was a 3d fighting game that was

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:19.040
put out by Titus software for ps2 and Nintendo Gamecube that was called

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:24.600
barbarian in the u.s. the game was licensed by Taito and called warrior

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.960
blade Rastan versus barbarian when it came out in Japan it also did come out

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:36.080
in Europe later it didn't really have Rastan in it though it wasn't really

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.600
related to the universe it was just oh we could put Rastan on this and it will

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.800
sell and he also made the character Rastan made an appearance in a title

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:52.040
game called champion wrestler as miracle Rastan and now this game it came into

01:36:52.040 --> 01:37:00.240
some censorship issues that while it wasn't really that adult content it had

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.320
blood splattered effects when you uh you know beat things yes red pixels yeah

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.640
they're right and in the Sega Master System support it actually had some

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:22.520
boobage in it the Gorgon and harpies were very booby and pubey and the Medusa

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:30.160
itself is actually just is all boobies so but I mean that was before we had

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:39.120
the ESRB so probably today it might have had an M rating how about that but no we

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:45.080
got boobs in the 80s and that's it all right there's your classic game of the

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:51.080
week Rastan not to be confused with Rygar which is it's especially the

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.400
arcade was somewhat of a similar looking game I mean the NES version was way

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.560
different but indeed not the same game Rastan and now that we're coming up to

stuff with you guys in our chat room at chat orange laundry calm a lot of folks

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:03.400
asking what we were playing live during the break now the podcast listeners

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.000
don't really hear this they just hear that ten seconds a little musical

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.440
interlude we do usually take a break of about six minutes or so we're actually

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.360
live taping you know to to run to the restroom or in this case get cake the

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.240
dark soccer brought or what have you and we played some music from OC remix

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.660
during the break I don't usually talk about this on the podcast but I had so

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:23.420
many live people asking what those songs were and the fact that you can go to OC

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.060
remix and just download these for yourselves I'll go ahead and tell you

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:30.560
what it was that first song was will rock was the artist from Mega Man 3 it

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:34.160
was called magnetic fireworks and the second song we played there was a remix

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.700
from the goonies to password music screen believe it or not but I like that

01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:43.000
mix a lot that was TJ neko with two K's any any EK KO with I'm taking it all

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.400
back was the name of that so those are the two songs from OC remix we played so

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.300
if you want podcast listeners what you could do is is you stop right when you

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:53.120
hear the music interlude go listen to those two songs then come back and it's

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.320
it's like you were listening live but you know obviously for copyright reasons

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:59.680
and so forth even though those songs are free to download on OC remix it just

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.460
isn't right for us to put them into our own darn show we're gonna be getting

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.720
into some rapid-fire news here in a minute but first I thought I would talk

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.440
Disneyland because you know I went to Disneyland this week I didn't miss any

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:14.360
shows because of it because we went in the middle of the week I've had like 18

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:18.720
days off of work it's been the best thing ever I sat on your cat yes so dark

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:23.640
soccer was cat sitting which of course we're incredibly thankful for and we

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.360
well we took some pictures we took some pictures they actually had the Tron bike

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.760

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.440
the week go figure I don't think it will be moving for it was it was the most

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:42.640
crowded I have ever seen if I get to go to the bonus day thing oh the February

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.320
29th thing yeah I don't know that's Disneyland not

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:49.400

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.560
weekends and yeah they're they're definitely replacing electronica come a

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:56.760

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.520
you will need to go to Disney World after that you should take it to the

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.480
extreme and go to Euro Disney I would actually love to or it's Disneyland

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.080
Paris now by the way but I would actually love to go to Disney World it's

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.240
just it's a little more expensive to go cross-country and you have to go just

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.600
the right time of year because I don't want to be super crowded but I don't

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:06.880
think they have a picture I'm gonna get blown away by the hurricane either and

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:10.960
then I'm putting it up on the on the orange challenge picture thingy

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:16.280

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.160
for Alan to get that out for Jamie so let's move on let's get back into some

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.920
gaming news get into some rapid-fire news thank you Alan for doing that by

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.760
the way all right thank you Alan for doing that let's go back to some gaming

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.880
news so I can eat some cake all right so the game by notch mini craft it's the

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:04.160
you know one that he created in 48 hours last year some important to the Android

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.600
devices and apparently it's not an official port of the game but it's been

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:15.640
done by a group called full stad consulting and has touchscreen controls

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:19.120
and all that fun stuff and apparently I believe it's free from the Android

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:25.720
marketplace so go check it out if you're interested in that this I have no idea

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:31.680
why people would buy this but there is a new device called the retro 2 it's a USB

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:38.240
device that allows you to play Super NES and Genesis games and emulators the

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:44.240
actual thing costs $85 but will allow you to plug in your controllers and what

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.480
not into it and play it through an emulator or you could probably buy a

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:53.880
real console for that price just saying I mean I don't know why you would bother

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.400
to try to play these through emulators just just last week we were talking

01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:00.800
about flea markets and like how some of the old systems still were like the

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:05.040
Super Nintendo I have over there still works so you know just go get the old

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.040
console seriously for 85 various spent $85 on something you can you can

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.080
literally I think you can buy those like portable handheld systems or whatever

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:17.880
that play you know Genesis and Super Nintendo games and stuff like that for

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:24.440
like less a lot less than that so I mean why would you bother to spend $85 on

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:31.360
that I got a text from Dan Duffy the focus group bear so I I just don't know

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:36.920
why but if you're interested you can check it out it's retro dot-com I

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:44.240
believe yes r-e-t-r-o-d-e if you want to purchase that and then of course a Bobo

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:51.880
you may remember him or not from the oh I know I can't remember the goddamn name

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:59.120
double dragon yes I was like dragon age dragon to dragon twin drag got wolf

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.080
something I know it has dragon isn't twin dragons like a plate no that's twin

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.440
Cobra and that was a helicopter game yes yes so about was big adventure is a

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:14.120
free-to-play flash game and of course features one of the characters from

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:21.080
double dragon this game reminds me a lot of oh what was the one that they did for

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:27.080
there was another one it was I can't remember now maybe it's this game

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:32.000
actually them thinking of anyways the game will be coming out on January 11th

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.280
and I guess it's a firm are confirmed on the official website about was big

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.480
adventure calm and you can play the game when it comes out and of course it

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:48.040
features a bunch of old NES settings and parodies so should be fun all right

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:52.040
moving on to some other rapid-fire news you know I love this series kid Icarus

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.120
of course there's the new uprising game that's coming out mmm what this quarter

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:59.120
at some point right do we have a firm date for that yet yeah it's in March I

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:02.080
just don't remember what date so at the end of this quarter but in the meantime

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.280
you can play with some fan remakes there's a fan remake out there called

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:10.880
super kid Icarus it's what they're calling a 16-bit remake but that's a

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.840
little bit deceptive because basically it's a PC version of kid Icarus that

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.600
uses 16-bit style sprites but very clearly a lot of the fonts and things

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.280
that are used or PC but whatever you can play it in your emulator and it's

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:27.000
basically kid Icarus was souped up graphics and easy mode so if you uh you

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.200
know kid Icarus is kind of a fucking hard game so if you want to play it a

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.240
little easier you can do that in this I did play a little bit of it just to I

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.400
wanted to see if there was more than just the first level in there and yes I

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.360
got all the way to the second level so there you go so they're playing now

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:44.280
before Nintendo pulls it down that's right you want to do that now before

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.160
they pull it down this is interesting because the website that actually has it

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:54.320
is home.com cast net slash tilde super kid Icarus so enjoy it now before it

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:58.000
gets pulled because I'm sure Comcast will get that cease and desist from

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.280
Nintendo any minute now meanwhile speaking of Nintendo a lot of folks very

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.280
excited about the Zelda 25th anniversary symphony that's going on the symphony of

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.700
the goddesses this is very similar to Final Fantasy dear friends video games

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:14.960
live that whole thing where they're gonna be playing Zelda music live it's

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:18.440
gonna be coming hopefully to a town near you at least if you live in the States

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:22.880
or certain parts of Canada January 10th is the first show in Dallas Texas March

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.000
14th in Vancouver March 26 in Seattle San Francisco on March 28th Denver on

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.640
April 7th April 20th 21st in Phoenix Atlanta on May 12th Montreal on May 31st

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:41.480
Austin on June 22nd Orlando on July 14th and Toronto on September 29th they are

01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:45.320
saying that there are more tour dates that are planned very interesting what's

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:49.920
not on the list so Cal so it's interesting to see maybe they'll do an

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:56.800
LA show possibly an LA show like around e3 who knows but yeah they're gonna be

01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.120
playing music from all the different Zelda games so it's not just the new one

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:05.720
so if you'd like live symphony I think you'll enjoy that God of War 4

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:11.480
apparently has been spotted on a composer's resume it's the first bit of

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:14.880
anything God of War 4 that we've seen was on the resume of Timothy Williams

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:19.840
who is the God of War series composer apparently it's on his resume but really

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.760
is it any fucking surprise to the God of 4 God of War 4 is in the making I

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:30.400
didn't think so God of 4 God of 4 I think that's that's what they should

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:36.880
actually call it so there you go God of 4 all right Dark Sakura no I will not

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.720

favorite band ever Hall & Oates I was gonna say Abba has an exclusive thing

Hall & Oates I'm gonna look like Steve Gutenberg I like what spazz nator

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.760
suggests in chat here god of guar god of war that would be awesome they should

01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:21.120
have a guar mod for God of War don't they have guar songs in rock band I got

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:26.440
to have something that would be awesome yeah and the last but not least House of

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:31.200
the Dead three and four are both coming to PSN but no typing of the dead so

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.960
therefore failure guess what I have two copies of typing of the dead for like

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:38.280
Dreamcast I don't even know where the fuck my Dreamcast keyboard is if I even

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.320
have I have the Dreamcast version and PC version you need to have typing of the

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.720
dead day you know what we need to do cuz Mavis Beacon ain't got shit on typing of

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:50.680
the dead you know we need to do what we need to get Jessica iguana girl she was

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:53.840
really good at that one she and we need to have a typing of the dead a thon

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:59.120
because when I got Michael when I got my copy I took it to her apartment the the

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:03.320
apartment that she was living in when I met her and we'd play typing of the dead

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:07.120
for like three hours I bet I bet I know what apartment that was she lived there

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:13.880
for ever several yes yes I remember that one yeah but the one that I stayed up

01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:18.760
for three days without sleep making a costume with Evan anyway anyway anyway

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:23.600
but yeah how's the dead three came out in 2002 and how's the dead four has only

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:28.400
been in the arcade so this is an exclusive to PSN nice now how about the

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.520
Silent Hill game I know different company but that Silent Hill arcade

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:35.760
game seriously why haven't we seen this released somewhere for the home because

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.120
they have a stick up their ass oh okay that answers everything and they're

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:44.240
currently stuck on it and the moment that they learn how to stand up without

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:50.360
taking the stick up their ass with them we'll probably see it I'm having to hide

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:55.840
poor Duffy's version Virgin Disney ears is it too much to ask for some Duffy

01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:03.960
come over here is too much to ask for some fucking silent hill arcade game

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:09.680
and I think that Rob has a potty mouth and he should eat so God this is just

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:14.120
like a little Santorum on Horde house this week I'm not even gonna explain it

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:18.800
what I'm not even gonna explain it horde house calm little centaur yeah that's I

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:29.800
can just imagine it ha at Rick Santorum asshole all right look yeah for the

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:35.560
record that was an authentic southern accent I know was it oh I couldn't is

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:42.520
that dark soccer is it George Bush I'm not sure moving on Loki maybe you can

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:45.640
bring some video game news back into this program that used to be about

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:50.920
gaming talk about piracy all right whatever I'll take what I can get so of

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:56.280
course a report came out talking about the most pirated games of 2011 this is

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.760
coming from torrent freak I would think that they would know a little bit about

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:07.920
piracy now now Loki Tory isn't it's just a bit torrent news site how dare you

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.000
well they should still be up to date with you know what's going on including

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.280
piracy I mean come on I'm not suggesting that they are pirating themselves or

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:21.720
facilitating party in any way I am just saying that you know they should know

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:26.880
something about it anyways the number one game that has been downloaded 3.9

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:34.520
million times since its release in March of 2011 the crisis to crisis to the

01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.560
game sequel to the game that killed PCs around the world you know but yes

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:44.760
crisis to number one game of course modern warfare 3 was downloaded an

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:50.520
estimated 3.6 million times since November so you know modern warfare 3

01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:54.880
had come out in March and they would probably been number one but oh well

01:54:54.880 --> 01:55:00.400
don't wait battlefield 3 coming in third with 3.5 million downloads and then of

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:07.760
course that ring rounding out the top 5 piva 12 and portal to there you go

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:15.320
surprised what's not on the list maybe anything I mean that was all PC stuff

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:20.960
let's talk a little bit about how about Xenoblade well I'm surprised more people

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:26.360
didn't pirate that to be able to play it in the US now now you spoke too soon the

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:32.600
top Wii game downloads on bit torrent in 2011 Super Mario Galaxy 2 Mario sports

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.240
mix what the fuck are people down the Mario sports mix that's a terrible very

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.120
good question I get galaxy 2 because that was on a lot of the best list and

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:44.480
Xenoblade Chronicles was number 3 Lego Pirates of the Caribbean number 4 and

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:52.200
FIFA 12 number 5 weird list yeah Xbox 360 downloads Gears of War 3 number 1

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.360
Call of Duty Mario warfare 3 number 2 battlefield 3 number 3

01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:02.040
Forza Motorsports 4 number 4 and connect sports season 2 number 5 not that we're

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:07.280
advocating piracy but you know it's it happens we'd be naive to sit here and go

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.040
oh it never happens that's all don't pay no attention behind a curtain it is

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:15.280
interesting to see what gets pirated and what doesn't because certain games don't

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:18.040
show up on the list at all because of maybe the DRM that's in the game like

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:23.160
for example or like a game like SWTOR can't be pirated that much because you

01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:29.040
have to have an online connection to play so hmm Starcraft 2 big PC game no

01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.120
more on that list I think because of the whole battle net tie-in of course a lot

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:35.520
that drives a lot of people bonkers because they don't want to be on the

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.960
internet to play the game so where's the happy middle ground I don't know all

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.160
right anyhow moving on to a system that I'm sure nobody's gonna pirate any games

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.680
on at all the Wii U there's a new rumor about the Wii U because you know rumors

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:52.880
about the Wii U or are everywhere and it's a slow news week so why the hell

01:56:52.880 --> 01:57:00.000
not apparently Wii U will also double as an e-reader this is apparently via a

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.760
friend who Nintendo approached to do iOS software ports over to the Wii U system

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:10.760
which doesn't surprise me at all that you know the Wii U would probably be

01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:14.920
going after things like Angry Birds cut the rope tiny tower the stuff that's

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:19.760
really big on iOS to be able to be played on the you know touch device I

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:23.360
wouldn't surprise me at all but apparently Nintendo is also looking at

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.200
doing digital books magazines comics and so forth on the Wii U and the 3ds

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.360
apparently instruction manuals could be done this way to strategy guides and

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:39.280
Nintendo power you know it'd be really funny hmm but there's no way this is

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:43.920
ever gonna happen is if the Wii U controller actually became its own

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:48.960
console but it can't I mean because all the processing is done on that I

01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:52.960
understand that they could put an ARM processor in there and how like its own

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:55.760
tablet yeah I'm kind of deja vu-ing what we talked about a little bit last week

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.040
but yeah we talked about how maybe one of the big things that they're gonna

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:01.880
change you know because the system could change a lot but until next t3 is that

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:05.660
maybe they're gonna put the its own processor a little or processor in the

01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:09.600
Wii U controller itself it's gonna drive the price of those things up even more

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:14.580
but processors are cheap really yeah I guess it's true it just depends on what

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:20.160
they put in there so DDR dollar bill in our chat room says we you trying to be a

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:27.280
tablet yeah tablets are terrible well here's the thing though I think a lot of

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:32.040
it would be the fact that Nintendo would have a big audience with kids like maybe

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:37.360
kids are too young to have their own iPad Rob what how well did the Pico do

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:42.240
really but but kids could use the Wii U controller I see that's the thing though

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.800
is I don't think kids are too young to have an iPad well let me put this way a

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.260
lot of parents don't think kids are too young to have an iPad and they will buy

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:53.600
them an iPad or an iPod or something I mean I remember seeing on some gaming

01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:58.520
blogs a stupid iPod you know touch freak out you know Christmas videos and stuff

01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:01.120
like that I mean come on parents are willing to buy their kids that kind of

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.920
stuff there are cat games on iPad I mean there's there's games for toddlers on

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:11.000
the iPad so I'm not surprised that they would do that and I mean seriously with

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.720
an iPad 3 coming out probably soon I mean it's only gonna drive the prices of

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:22.320
the older models down so why wouldn't they you know parents buy an iPad I'm

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:26.560
not surprised parents will let their kids play with an iPad because people

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:30.520
are letting their frogs and lizards play with their iPad that ant smasher game

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:38.640
well people are dumb well as long as the as long as the Wii U gets swap note

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.840
that's all I care about which by the way if you could smile big cuz I'm gonna

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:45.000
take a picture for Bobby here maybe I'm not smiling big maybe I'll send it to

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.680
Tiger Claw to their little 3d picture there of all our life all right with

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:59.080
Duffy adorable hey swap note is actually pretty cool it's like it's it's like

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:04.360
it's like Nintendo is finally understanding email well I'm glad they

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:12.040
got that bad bank bandwagon if I can only speak now I'm yeah man I'm really

02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:19.080
looking forward to them understand you know patching games in 2021 or something

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:23.400
like that you know maybe with the Wii U that we'll get some actual game

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:30.200
patching fantastic Nintendo and for the record I'm putting a picture of Duffy's

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:37.400
butt on the olr thing orange launch radio.com all right let's take a moment

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.480
to visit the mailbag every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:48.680
radio.com and dark soccer dives into the email bag and read your favorite emails

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:51.640
I was gonna say we should start taking emails over swap note but you'd have to

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:57.360
have my friend code to do that Duffy should start reading them no Duffy

02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:01.680
should not read them all right anyhow while I work on my swap note I'm gonna

02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:04.440
send a swap note to Bobby and I guess I'll send it to Tiger Claw I don't know

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:07.280
who else listens to olr on my friends list but I'll send it to them too well I

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:13.000
wanted to announce that we do have three winners for the Master System contest

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.040
wieners wieners that means I have to do I think I've got games enough to divide

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:25.720
amongst them as well someone is from will and I will be logging into the

02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:37.760
email when I get home another one is where is it from Rico and one of them

02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:45.160
was hit stun so congratulations to our winners Congrats to all you wieners and

02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:50.880
I'm gonna try to send you ones that you don't already have so and I know who's

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:57.160
about getting wet and if you get a duplicate sorry eBay we can autograph

02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:03.520
them though if you want us to so back to the the mailbag I just played the worst

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:08.160
game in history of Nintendo DS I asked for it for Christmas because I love

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:13.920
Puss in Boots and a sexy Antonio voice well unfortunately the reviews I were

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:17.680
looking at were for the Wii version of the game which apparently is decent this

02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:22.320
however this abomination should never have been made it is surely the spawn of

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.480
Satan and all copies should be destroyed seriously the graphics look like

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:32.000
something back from early early PlayStation 1 or Nintendo 64 back when

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.500
their characters look like they were made of Lego blocks no voices and the

02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:39.520
gameplay tap the screen to the beat no seriously that's the whole stupid game

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:44.640
and that's what I get for buying a tie-in game I guess but I really thought

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:51.440
the treat puss with some respect sad face Holly D haven't we warned you

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:57.200
about tie-ins that's right game tie-ins can be pretty bad but or movie is game

02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:03.680
times movie tie-ins games can be pretty bad next email bummer though hi olr crew

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.600
I've never seen the tester on PSN not the first season of the second mostly

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:11.400
because I'm over reality shows I also thought the grand prize of being an

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:14.220
entry-level tester was kind of stupid though a great way for you to get your

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:17.440
foot in the door but I think I'm going to start watching the new season because

02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:21.160
I just found out a friend of a friend is a contestant we were chatting on

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:23.920
Facebook and I asked her if she'd be interested in appearing as a guest on

02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:28.800
olr but only if you're interested she seemed very interested and I would have

02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:32.920
to get but would have to get back to me to see if corporate folks would allow

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:38.280
her to do so so my question is would you be interested why the hell not sure I

02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:41.760
want to know who beat dark soccer for the position no dark soccer went through

02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:47.560
herself right I'm not gonna give any more of her information just because

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.200
because it's included in the email sure sure but we are interested yeah why not

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:56.200
if corporate PSN will let us then we're happy for it I would love to ask some

02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:00.200
questions about the stuff I want to wait till the show debuts though so we can be

02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:03.340
like okay how bad did they misrepresent this well maybe there is at least one

02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:08.080
person it's somewhat internet celebrity that's actually in there oh really yeah

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:12.560
the guy does I don't know if you've ever seen them the the awesome games like

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:20.480
Metal Gear awesome they're like great he's actually in in the contention there

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:25.240
that's funny so rooting for him because he's the only person they recognize

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:29.920
vaguely anyway says thanks and keep up the good work and thanks for putting the

02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:33.800

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:17.680
Network Operations Center I'm suffering probably from maybe a newer condition

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:21.800
called gamers loneliness or gamers depression I am an okay looking guy

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:25.860
average weight and height I have money in a car I'm having problems finding a

02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:30.680
companion I like women so I'm not alone I've tried POF okay cupid geek to geek

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:34.880
with no success I think it might be my age and the single gamer women are ultra

02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:39.020
rare maybe the fact that I don't drink or go to clubs slash bars I do know my

02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:42.840
schedule is bad I work Friday to Monday 12-hour shifts with a two-hour commute

02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:46.680
to work each day but it's my job to deal with this I've been buying tons of games

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:51.080
that go into my never-ending backlog and buying lots of gamer where my room looks

02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:56.320
like a gamers cache now I can have any game I want and have three days off a

02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:00.560
week I can game but I'm not any happier I even stopped playing DDR in the air I

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:05.000
kids because I was tired of playing by myself and I stopped getting any

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.520
enjoyment in fact I don't feel happy you're doing anything I've been trying

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:12.760
to do changes from but the results end up the same I don't want to be something

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:15.800
I am NOT just to conform to find someone to be with I wish I could find a

02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:20.920
companion like you guys I would marry Dark Soccer's clone thank you I don't

02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:25.720
have a clone Dark Soccer is married however I wanted to let you all know

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:28.520
this information because there could be other gamers out there that could be

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:32.240
feeling the way I feel I'm not sure if this is just how the world world

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:35.880
balances us gamers out of future equations reduce population your loyal

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:38.880
listener track slur this message is brought to you by Shermie Skylander

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:48.680
Emporium Wow DB mail okay um that threw me for a little bit of a curveball I I

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:55.480
think it's one of those things where when you kind of let it go that you kind

02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:58.840
of have all that hanging over your head like oh my god I need this perfect life

02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:03.000
and I need this companion and I need I need all this to happen ABC to happen so

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.200
I can be happy no no no you have to learn to be happy with what you've got

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:10.400
and you're kind of like your current situation and then once you kind of have

02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:16.680
that about you that that confidence the rest of it will come I think I think I

02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:21.600
always say it happens when you stop trying to force it I mean yeah I also

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:24.560
say things happen when you make them happen but that's like stuff that you

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:31.200
have tangible control over you know like I I can't do this well then go to school

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:36.760
and learn how to do it you know that type of thing in this case you know like

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:41.280
with and I know I've told the story million times we Dan and I hooked up is

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:46.360
that we had just been friends we weren't trying to do anything and he just called

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:52.600
me to cheer me up and we kept talking because it worked and I moved out here

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:58.640
and we worked you know that's just that's like a really rare success story

02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:04.520
on top of that you know it was just sort of a faded thing I guess but like I

02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:09.920
really think that that a good relationship will find you when you're

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:14.560
not looking for one if that makes sense yeah I mean Alan and I were friends

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:18.320
online for probably four or five years via live journal just you know and you

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:21.440
know I'm sure he thought you know I was attractive I thought he was attractive

02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:23.840
but it's kind of like yeah he lives in San Francisco it's it's like he lives in

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.520
China you know so far away and we never really gave it any thought until one day

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:32.960
it just kind of let's go out sometime and and we did and then it was kind of

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:37.200
like well we're gonna make this work and we did so you know it just it just

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:40.840
happened like I never thought it would and it did you know oh there's somewhere

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.600
in the back of my imagination I imagine Nelly going after Loki with the club

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:54.240
isn't that what a girl but you know for real like I I wouldn't like just don't

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:57.640
stress about it like that's I you're only gonna cause yourself like hurt to

02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:01.520
do that and I don't think you need to go out to bars or clubs I think you're

02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.160
doing the right thing just kind of put yourself out there online I would say if

02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:08.920
you really feel like you need to go out and do something try maybe like I know

02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.880
this sounds really weird but try like joining a club or maybe there's a

02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:16.560
nonprofit in your area a political cause you can get behind the volunteer you

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:20.080
know something where you you force yourself to get out of the house well

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.160
when I lived in Alabama and keep in mind this is when I was effectively single

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:30.800
you know I did a lot of stuff I larped yes I played live-action vampire shut up

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:38.400
there's not else to do in Alabama I I was in band I did jazz band I was in

02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:44.480
orchestra you know because I was still a big band nerd I would do ensembles with

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:48.720
other friends I would I played the end oh god that was when I was in eight

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:55.320
games a week for a while and I did there was even I gamed every night every night

02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:00.440
I was in different gaming groups so I mean and I even dated a couple of people

02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:05.360
that I gamed with like there was one guy who I was really into for a while but we

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:10.200
just kind of never sort of fun to make out with and you know fun to make out

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:14.800
with good friend you know never that's that's exactly the type of people I met

02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:19.520
doing Rocky Horror for so many years it's almost the same kind of thing but I

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:27.120
mean you know if if you're making yourself into some kind of hermit I mean

02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:31.000
you're not gonna meet anybody unless you find ways to branch out you have to make

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.800
it yourself and so okay so clubs aren't your deal you know what I hate clubs too

02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:41.480
I sometimes go just because I like booze and I like goth music so I'll go hang

02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:46.040
out but I don't you know go because I'm well then again I didn't really start

02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:50.480
clubbing until I moved out here at all but if that's not your thing then find

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.680
you know I I've made friends through my temple for example after I converted and

02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:58.640
I don't know if you're religious or anything but you know there's always

02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.880
something you can do with like-minded people you know or you know if check out

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.320
actually check out YMCA because sometimes they offer not just you know

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.120
the little fitness things that they do but they'll have workshops and classes

02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:18.520
or you know find something that you're interested in and then put in that topic

02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:24.240
and your location and see if you can find groups for it but for and coming

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:26.520
back to this point is I think this is very important I think the first thing

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:29.580
you have to do then we'll stop the advice show I promise but I think the

02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:31.920
first thing you have to do is you have to really sit down and say I have a good

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:37.600
life I mean you do have a job you you I don't you know you right but you know

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:41.560
but you you have a lot of stuff that's going for you for you right now you know

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:46.920
you have a you know the things that you're proud of and you know I don't

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:50.080
know this person so it's hard for me to say you know whatever they are into but

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:53.560
there's probably a lot and in the person who says his email you know I'm I

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:58.360
consider myself good-looking you have a lot going for you then you know so love

02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:02.680
yourself yeah find the stuff that makes you happy and focus on that you know if

02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:07.400
if the games aren't doing it for you anymore then there's another gap mm-hmm

02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:12.200
distract yourself but I'm not saying distract yourself in a don't work on the

02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:18.100
problem kind of way but I'm sorry reading chat but I was gonna say you

02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:25.040
know find new things you know if if your current hobbies not doing it for you

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:30.100
find a new hobby but you have to be out there is the thing if you're gonna try

02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:32.160
to meet somebody you have to be out there and I'll be a hermit

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:42.720
Loki won't be your dating advice my advice is hey you're gonna have a lot of

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:47.480
hookers sometimes it's actually nice to have a lot of free time to play the

02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:50.000
games you want to play because you're not gonna have that because once you

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.920
have a baby that all goes away it's all gone that's good advice that's you know

02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:59.320
what and that's that's another way to look at it like I'm not saying like you

02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.840
know hate on kids or whatever cuz you know but enjoy the life you have while

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:07.840
you have it right yeah so there you go anyway I mean sometimes you know yeah

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:11.160
it's just like you know however if you want to incorporate sex life and your

02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:18.480
video gaming you could try jlist because they have lots of stops honestly I just

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:29.320
go to cons that's not a bad idea why not Chris and Megsy did they meet at a con

02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.160
that online oh how funny I went to conventions we went to we had that

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.160
three-day thing it is it is a social going out meeting other people yes just

02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:41.240
I've known people who've met for the love of God use protection and you know what my

02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:45.880
lesbian parents met at a convention oh there you go back in the day all right

02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.360

02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:14.400

Loki if you do Microsoft Excel that constantly try to outsmart it in order

to get to do what I wanted to have visual basic yeah but see I don't want

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.060
pretty good mood like I should be giving an F you to the fact that I have to go

02:17:09.060 --> 02:17:11.680
back to work tomorrow after being off for like two and a half weeks but I'm

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:15.760
like seriously this is the longest vacation I've had since I started

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:18.640
working there which was ten years ago which didn't involve me being in the

02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:22.360
hospital or having surgery or having the swine flu which happened once and even

02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:25.280
that it wouldn't have had the swine flu I'm still sorry about that Rob I was

02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:29.840
only out for like two weeks not to have so but I actually like I'm so well

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:34.240
rested and feel so good I'm like I'm actually this weird looking forward to

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:40.240
going back to work so in reality we'll say yes so F you to that all messing

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:43.800
with my mind I do you know what though I'm lucky I'm very fortunate I really do

02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:47.840
enjoy my job it's not I I teach people for a living it's a it's a great thing I

02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.060
love my job I really do and they're not small children it's just sometimes some

02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:56.200
of the others you know stuff everybody gets annoyed with their job at some

02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:01.120
point you know because anytime you put a bunch of personalities together and you

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:04.480
know one's in charge or whatever you know things might go but I I have a

02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:09.880
great boss I really do my boss is awesome we work so well together I can't

02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.120
really complain so F you did the fact that I don't take two and a half week

02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:17.860
vacations more often because I really should and F you did the fact that the

02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:22.680
only way I was able to do it before was getting the swine flu you know what I'm

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:29.720
sorry I need to reward myself more often that's what I I guess that's all right I

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:36.880
didn't know I had it I rubbed AIDS all over the bear I'm just kidding let's

02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:47.640
move on Loki all right so Nintendo being the forefront of digital and online

02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:56.360
they apparently slapped the wrists of the owner director of icon games

02:18:56.360 --> 02:19:03.960
entertainment and Richard Hill Whithall he apparently has released several games

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:09.960
in the last year on various platforms and he recently shared some sales

02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:14.680
numbers on the website gamasutra but then was asked by Nintendo to take down

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:21.000
the numbers for its platforms according to Richard Nintendo doesn't allow

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:25.600
developers to share digital sales numbers for self-published we were in

02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:31.120
downloadable ds titles that's kind of interesting and apparently I guess it

02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:36.160
hurts smaller developers who I guess need to make those sales numbers known

02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:40.960
in order to secure financing and plan out business models and stuff like that

02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:46.840
yeah apparently though you can still kind of figure out his numbers because

02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:50.280
he gives a total number and then you know the other platforms and do the math

02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:55.360
I have to do math and and and on top of that the numbers weren't so good on the

02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:59.320
Nintendo platforms unfortunately so maybe that's why they don't want numbers

02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:03.000
out there there's a lot of saturation on the Wii marketplace too and it's really

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.480
hard for games to stand out because the Wii store isn't set up very well you

02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:15.320
know yeah all right well we talked a little bit earlier in the show and I

02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:18.720
know Bobby talked a lot on his show tonight of course Bobby black wolf was

02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:21.800
on before us at all games radio talked a lot about SOPA and you know the

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:25.160
Internet's been talking a lot about SOPA and I'm sure most of you you know

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:30.520
listening they're gonna scrub it clean of content most of you guys who are tech

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:33.880
savvy enough to download this podcast and listen to it and understand it

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:37.960
probably already have a general awareness about SOPA but this is how

02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:41.840
the message might be communicated to those that don't understand SOPA I find

02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:47.200
this very interesting apparently they're talking about a huge what they call the

02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:52.080
nuclear option to protest SOPA and this is rumored to be happening on January

02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:55.400
23rd because the Senate is going to debate this on the 24th and what we're

02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:01.720
talking about is major major websites shutting down essentially for a day you

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:05.920
know replaced with a black screen generally talking about how you know how

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:12.400
soap is bad and all that stuff we're talking AOL, eBay, Facebook, Etsy, Google,

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:18.560
Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Zynga game network this out ties into gaming and

02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:22.240
really I mean this is just just anybody who cares about tech has a vested

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:27.160
interest in SOPA and I don't I think I've made this pretty clear as as Loki

02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:31.360
as a start soccer but olr is obviously against SOPA and based on the reason

02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:36.800
that it gives companies way too much power I understand that people want to

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:40.800
do something about piracy but there has to be I think more accountability in

02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:46.160
that regard and SOPA is not really gonna do anything for some sites it's if you

02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:49.200
know the numbers you're gonna be able to get on the pirate bag I just don't

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:52.600
understand so I know does it hurt I don't understand that it's almost like

02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:57.840
to me like a really terrible web filter that's at like someone's office or

02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:01.880
something like that where it's like oh I can't go to Facebook oh but if I type in

02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.480
the near the IP address I can go to Facebook if that's all they're doing to

02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:10.440
block this and that's kind of stupid you're not supposed to censor the

02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:13.920
internet you know what I mean you're not that that's what that's what we read

02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:17.880
about and go how can China stand that to have the web censored I mean I

02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:22.760
understand it's just a part of you know that country and all that but you know

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:27.640
is that what we want to become here it's just it's it's yucky and I I personally

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:31.880
I I I think the Atari story you kicked off the show with illustrates it per

02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:36.260
perfectly there's gonna be companies that are gonna overreach and the little

02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:39.760
people aren't gonna be able to fight them and that's wrong that is so not

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:42.880
what America is supposed to be about well then again we can also detain

02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:47.640
people for no good reason well you know that's that's a whole nother Oprah or

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:52.200
so they say but yeah but it's I think it's all related it's it's screwed up

02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:56.200
how much power companies have in this country it really is it's getting this

02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:59.760
well I don't get political on the show not nearly as often as she does but this

02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:02.600
is something that really irritates me and especially when you have all these

02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:07.000
video game companies where the ESA has stood against it you know because no

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:11.440
piracy bad so the ESA stands against it but most of the gaming companies like we

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:15.100
don't a lot of the gaming companies were reached out to for comment and basically

02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:20.440
came back with we don't we don't really do politics we just make games so the

02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:28.240
ESA kind of speaks for us what what educate yourself well that's fine if you

02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:31.160
don't if you're gonna let someone else but it's for you and it's gonna be those

02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:37.440
morons the people that don't understand why this is very bad that are gonna ruin

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:42.280
it it doesn't really affect them I mean as far as their product goes the fact

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:47.440
that they are these big companies that are gonna be able to pull Justin TV

02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:51.040
feeds and things that might be critical about their game that ought to be legal

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:53.680
under fair use when these little reviewers are gonna be able to fight

02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:56.960
them that is when they don't even fucking understand the law they just

02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:01.400
know they can do it exactly bothers me exactly why do they care then that's the

02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:04.520
point it was all you're gonna give us a bunch of power to take down all these

02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:09.520
people that we don't like sweet why would I oppose that but of course they're

02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:14.520
not gonna say oh yeah we were strongly for that because then people backlash

02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:18.000
against them so they got to take you know the on the fence approach or oh

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.760
we're just hands off we'll let them do whatever you know that way they can't

02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:26.440
let you know well I think that first sites that can't if people want to add

02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:31.200
though I think to the sites that are gonna be down on that day but you can't

02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:35.240
necessarily take down you know your server or anything if you've got a blog

02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:39.440
or something you know say I've got a couple blogs on blogspot put a big

02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:44.320
notice no activity on this day you know don't post on Facebook that day don't I

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.520
mean Facebook's gonna be dumb I'm saying don't blog do it because maintain web

02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.760
silence you know there if you imagine if you can't use Google for a day I mean

02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:59.200
that's gonna piss some people off I think that's necessary I think it's

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.480
necessary they should all be they should all go down so now let's see what did I

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.160
want to say here Oh frisbee in our chat says may I suggest these companies use

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:11.640
ocean marketing to speak for them I realize you're making a joke there but

02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:14.480
think about how did that whole thing really how did that whole thing happen

02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:22.400
the guy represented himself as something he kind of wasn't right anyway

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:27.600
Tiger class as I recall two years ago take to send DMCA notices to several

02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:32.200
Justin TV channels that were showing GTA 4 when it first came out I believe this

02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:38.060
is because they didn't want spoilers being leaked spoilers are gonna get out

02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:42.260
there if not in text forms it's just it's silly anyway if you want to do

02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:45.760
something about it that's my problem right there though that's not because

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.200
your your copyrights were violated or because someone's you know posting it as

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:54.520
like their own thing it's because oh we don't want spoilers coming out that's

02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:00.320
not a reason to go and say hey I need these videos taken down I'm sorry but

02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:03.480
that's like you know review spoiling the end of a book or something like that you

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.640
can't you can't force them to take it down because you don't like the fact

02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:10.680
that someone spoiled the book all right so anyhow if you want to do something

02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:14.640
about SOPA I gotta give props to destructoid to compile this pretty good

02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:18.920
article that they have on their website they was posted January 7th talking

02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:21.840
about SOPA and they even have kind of some form letters that you can copy

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:25.960
paste although I would kind of encourage you to put your own thing on it I mean a

02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:29.180
lot of them prior aren't even gonna get read let's be real but send this to put

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:35.000
on our tumblr to okay I'll do that send that over to you know I'll get props to

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:39.360
destructoid they did and one other thing I like they compiled a list this is very

02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:43.320
useful a list of all these game companies where you can contact directly

02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.040
emails and websites and I thought that was pretty cool so you know you can take

02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:52.400
your case to the companies themselves that are supporting this I am do I need

02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:58.480
to even say like look at what happened to go daddy and that was who that was a

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:03.000
bit of a mess and talk about a backpedal there I mean seriously oh actually no

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:11.320
we're not a we're against SOPA now yeah right so let me send that over to Rama

02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.360
and you can put that on the tumblr if you want to read more about that orange

02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:20.560
launch radio tumbler calm alrighty let's move on with some more news getting into

02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:24.720
some phone calls very soon at 1 877 game olr or a username on skype orange launch

02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:28.760
radio but not just yet a few more emails dark Sakura you Suzuki who my husband

02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:31.280
has met I have a photo of Dan with you Suzuki

02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:37.480
it's very faded now but he said something in an interview with the Toulouse

02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:43.480
game show so this is in French and I'm going to read it in French if I can

02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.760
remember my pronunciation right no pool no to near a license party the Sega

02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:52.040
which means we can obtain the license from Sega do you know what they're

02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:59.480
talking about Shenmue so he's not saying that they are actively going to do it

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:03.920
but I think it means that there might be an interest in them trying to obtain it

02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:09.280
for a YS net which is his company so maybe it'll happen that would be kind of

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:13.520
cool if it did don't you think very cool if you want I think he should play a

02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:21.040
game of lucky hit uh-huh you know all I ever knew that game was play space

02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:28.360
Harrier anyway so you can the interview is actually up on YouTube if you want to

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:35.200
find it it's the you Suzuki interview on Shenmue so all right I would be great

02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:39.140
I'd love to see that series come back I think a lot of people would I think he

02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:44.520
wants to finish it true no it's like he's got a story that's like mostly told

02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:53.400
it's got like one chapter left really and what's it out all right Loki you

02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:57.360
know I'm actually surprised that this took this long to settle but you

02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:02.480
remember way back when I'm back before you could use USB drives and you know

02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:07.720
near Xbox 360 you're limited to their overpriced hard drives and their memory

02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:11.280
units which you know really didn't have a lot of space on them and they were

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:16.920
really expensive and a company day tell came out and you know had this wonderful

02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:22.600
max memory device you plop a micro SD card into and be able to save your games

02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:28.920
to that and everything was peachy keen until Microsoft patched the Xbox 360 to

02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:34.360
block these from being used on the device and of course then there was

02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:39.360
lawsuits filed and all that fun stuff well they've settled out of court

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:44.200
probably because at this point even if that were to be allowed to be used on

02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:48.520
their you know system no one's using the memory cards anymore because it doesn't

02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:52.680
work but the consumers who bought these didn't get anything no they got nothing

02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:56.640
well hooray to these companies for settling but the consumers got screwed

02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:00.280
didn't they yep what do they get out of it for buying these products that don't

02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:04.440
work the satisfaction knowing that you know the US justice system has triumph

02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:11.760
well golly gee willikers Loki now I can sleep at night I'm glad you can all

02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:16.080
right somebody's celebrating a birthday this week in fact they're turning 30

02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:21.560
years old if you can believe it it's the Commodore 64 that's right the Commodore

02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:26.480
64 celebrated its 30th birthday this week and all I have to say is man I feel

02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:31.840
old because I grew up on the Commodore 64 I remember having one of these I

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:35.720
think we got it Christmas like 83 but the Commodore 64 actually came out in

02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:42.680
1982 I love this the whole machine would hold the equivalent of one one hundredth

02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:50.960
of an mp3 file $595 is how much these systems cost back in 1982 they say that

02:30:50.960 --> 02:30:57.920
is now with inflation $1400 today is how much these things cost it was first

02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:03.160
introduced at the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and yeah

02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:10.520
boy Commodore 64 now 30 years old and man I love my Commodore 64 so many good

02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:14.720
games and those sit chips man so much chiptune stuff the year today is just

02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:19.640
directly influenced by the Commodore 64 I wish I still had a working one of

02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:23.720
these I had a Commodore 64 C we actually broke our original Commodore 64 and we

02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:28.960
got a 64 C the white one and that was a pretty awesome machine I was five did

02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:32.780
you have when it came out no I told you I didn't have a Commodore 64 I had a

02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:41.480
click Oh Adam with the cassette deck by the way on a related note would you like

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:46.160
to feel old for a minute here are some other games that are turning not systems

but games that are turning 30 years old this year in 2012 you're ready these

02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:28.240
out of that at godfather's pizza when I was little liberator that's the one

02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:30.600
that's the first one I don't really recognize that was an Atari game

02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:36.360
millipede moon patrol Oh God I used to love moon patrol we have this a local

02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:42.920
arcade mr. dew I love mr. dew pango you love pango fucking love pango that's a

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:47.000
great game that's the little penguins you know they had one at Pasquale ace

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:54.480
and it finally broke Oh pole position love pole position Popeye remember that

02:32:54.480 --> 02:33:01.000
and they did a game out of it because Nintendo made it a reactor robotron 2084

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.400
they had a version of that on Xbox Live that was one of the first arcade games

02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:06.960
that came out on Xbox Live Q Burt that's another game I played the crap out of

02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:11.760
them I know the swearing guy with a long nose everybody thought this had an

02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:15.680
awesome name Satan's Hollow it's actually kind of a derpy game but you

02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:21.000
know it was a it was the Midway it's on the arcade treasures for Midway and all

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.320
that and it's kind of kind of see in collections but it runs on that same

02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:28.080
hardware as like journey and timber and some of those old classic Midway games

02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:39.560
sin a star beware I live space duel Star Trek the Sega one time pilot tutankham

02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:48.760
Tron is 30 years old and Zaxxon by saying 30 years that's what I need to do

02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:57.920
for classic game mm-hmm so there you go now we can all feel old together just

02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:01.520
think in 30 years when we're sitting here on our show celebrating the 40th

02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:07.720
anniversary going hey remember you remember the Xbox 360 fucking bastard

02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:14.400
stole all my money fucking thing broke after only having it a week I had to

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:21.800
send it in but damn there was some good games all right hopefully by then we're

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.000
all playing the holodeck though because remember gaming is just inching forward

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.680
slowly to the holodeck all right one eight seven seven game olr or our

02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:34.360
username on Skype Skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call

02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:39.880
right now and talk to us meanwhile let's do some tweets we will start with a

02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:45.240
tweet from ramaditya night says sonic and knuckles I remember back in the day

02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:49.760
I used the cheat that allowed me to change sonic to whatever item I want and

02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:53.560
cross the wall I found a lot of bugs like a place you were not supposed to be

02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:56.160
able to go there spikes all around I wonder if that was so is that like a

02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:58.800
code in the game or is that something like a game genie remember the game

02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:02.440
genie where you could like hacks or the game I'm sure that is something that

02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:07.080
Loki had to own the game genie oh yeah well he's talking about on the game

02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:10.040
gene he was talking about sonic and knuckles and some of the things you

02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:14.160
could do with that yeah I used to actually sit down all night with my game

02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:17.760
genie and my SNES mm-hmm and just try to figure out what different codes by

02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:21.600
altering other codes hmm and I found a few ones like ones that turn Mario green

02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:26.600
that was it all it did was turn Mario green that's all it does yeah makes

02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:30.880
Mario Luigi but not really it turned his skin green all right let's go to the

02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:33.360
phones cuz we're getting some calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:38.240
hey what's up guys you know hey guys you know what's on your mind buddy not

02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:42.040
much I just want to talk about this sober thing I think a lot of us over

02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:45.920
reacting first off I don't think it's gonna go through and if it did go

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.200
through I don't think it's gonna be that big of a deal I think that a lot of

02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:52.880
people are getting worked up and they're freaking out all over nothing I think

02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:57.360
pretty much what uh what these companies want to do you know the game companies

02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:02.440
movies music whatever they they just want to make money so pretty much this

02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:06.660
law going out is just gonna be a way for them to protect their content and be

02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:09.400
able to put it on their sites and make their type of money that they want to

02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:13.640
make I don't think they're necessarily trying to shut down the internet or stop

02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:17.700
us from talking on Facebook or any of that kind of stuff well I it's it's a

02:36:17.700 --> 02:36:24.080
fair viewpoint and I understand that but but could it happen to one person I mean

02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:27.720
I like again I have to refer to the Atari thing at the beginning of the show

02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:30.600
that they're pulling down all these games that they may or may not have the

02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:35.320
ability to do and I worry that legal departments of companies who don't

02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:39.080
really understand things might go a little batshit crazy and the problem is

02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:42.680
if you leave the door or what's the expression you give them an inch and

02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:47.440
they take a yard I I worry about putting that much power into a corporation's

02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:50.360
hand because people you and me can't fight it

02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:56.640
yeah true that is I can see a point there I'm not clearly I understand why

02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:00.760
they want to do something about piracy I get it but can you ever really stop

02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:07.400
piracy I'm not sure there's no way they can stop it this is I mean I mean I

02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:10.120
don't mean to cut you off but I mean if you if you look at the record like as

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:15.280
far as piracy goes like when it comes to um movies and video games a lot of the

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:19.600
stuff that's like highly pirated or also the stuff that sells the most you know

02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:26.200
I think music is the only place that actually has a they should really do

02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:29.640
something about piracy because I mean you don't have to mod anything on your

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:34.640
system to be able to play the illegal download of music that you download right

02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:39.440
so I think the music industry is the one that's taking the real heat from it but

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:44.300
not necessarily the games and the movie industry right you know and I again I

02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:48.040
understand they want to do something but I just think this is going to do more

02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:52.720
harm than good because what's it really gonna fix that the IP for the pirate Bay

02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:56.360
will be out there within within minutes of this thing passing and everybody will

02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:00.160
have it and there'll be add-ons for Google Chrome and Firefox it will lie

02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:06.720
there already are there already are so I mean I just it's not gonna do any good

02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:10.840
so I buy but I understand why they want to do something but I think at the end

02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:14.800
of the day it's gonna be accountability you want to prove that someone stole

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:19.360
money from a bank they got to go to court have a trial it's kind of what's

02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.960
got to happen in this case you know yeah they just they just need to understand

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:25.600
the internet more like they're still trying to treat the internet like if

02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:29.840
it's the the real world where it's not doesn't necessarily work like that you

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:35.040
know so I think that they need to seriously look this over they come up

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.320
with you know with the better law the better soap or whatever else you want to

02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:42.840
call it but um I'm not really that worried about it well I don't know I I

02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:49.440
I hope you're right but I I do worry about leaving that opportunity there but

02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:54.040
you're a little more optimistic than I so I I applaud you for that so I hope

02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:58.440
you're right optimistic to a fault all right anything else you want to share

02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:01.160
listeners you guys have a good night all right you too buddy take care of tonight

02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.400
bye all right you know what it's it's cool that he has a differing opinion and

02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:10.900
you know I again I I hope I think he said it best at the end there maybe he's

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:15.680
optimistic to a fault but you know we'll see we'll see actions speak louder than

02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:18.700
words so we'll see but I just have a feeling the first time a website gets

02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:24.640
shut down incorrectly it's gonna just all hell's gonna break loose all right

02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:27.760
one eight seven seven game all our username on Skype is orange lounge radio

02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:32.520
meanwhile we have some more tweets tiger claw on Twitter sends us a tweet one of

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.600
them is already about that media molecule thing you already talked about

02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:38.800
earlier but the other one is about PlayStation 3 video editing app play

02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:43.600
memory studio apparently leaked ahead of CES this might be something that they're

02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.640
Sony's gonna show at CES and we'll get to that in a minute but we're gonna take

02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:50.800

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:08.920
getting bad feedback happy new year to you how's this now I'm still hearing it

02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:12.520
but it's not it's not killing me get out your question or comment fast we'll try

02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:18.920
to make this quick call oh okay which is a quick story a while back I don't know

02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:22.200
if I posted by look I said that I stopped playing Wow because I got sick

02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:27.600
of all the jackasses kept bitching about everything I kept doing in the game can

02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:30.720
you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you yeah people are people are assholes on

02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.440
the internet unfortunately yeah so for once a long time I pretty much just

02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:40.720
quit like whole mmorpgs then I try try a couple other free ones out there and

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:45.600
then I tried out DC Universe when it came out for free uh-huh

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:48.720
to the point of loving it so much I actually brought the down I should about

02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.320
DLC sports so you're saying the community in DC Universe online maybe

02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:56.980
not so bad um consider that one time I played 130

02:40:56.980 --> 02:41:04.160
more and Ruth making to me we're making jokes about um let's see 16 year olds and

02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:09.560
an all women's squad and everybody's dueling in the middle of nowhere it was

02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:13.720
a lot more fun you know sometimes it's just about finding the right fit for you

02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:17.560
and although you know unfortunately a couple jackasses probably ruined Wow for

02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.100
you and I would argue there's other people in there maybe it just wasn't a

02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:24.480
fit for you after all maybe DC Universe is just you know kind of better I don't

02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:27.960
think you have to play one MMO just because it's the popular one you like

02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:31.480
what you like there's people out there that fucking play Hello Kitty island

02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.080
adventure and they fucking love it so you know what let them have their thing

02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:38.960
yeah but it goes back to well for one last thing cuz I'm not gonna keep it

02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:44.040
short okay after when I got to my finally hit level 30 and DC Universe the

02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:49.880
final level I found out that I actually have to group and it made me realize

02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:54.400
that maybe it's okay to group with people once in a while just gotta find

02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:58.920
the right group so I went back on Wow I quit this one guild I was with and I

02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:03.360
joined up with another guild and was a whole different experience well I have

02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:06.440
to perfect story I got I got to hang up on you to your dollar bill though cuz

02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:09.720
like the chair I'm saying it sounds like you're living in a hunt bees nest but

02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:15.040
thank you so much buddy have a good one yeah well here's what I was gonna tell

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:19.860
you and just message me in the chat room um is when I started playing well when I

02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:24.240
finally liked it again I did not play with other people at all all I did was

02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:29.200
chat with the guild and quest by myself and yeah and I've done two characters

02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:33.720
that way I did Rebecca black and Iressa both that way but now I've actually got

02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:38.680
a character that I am doing nothing but instances with and and maybe you know

02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:44.160
seasonal quests and little things but the point is is that I'm actually trying

02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:49.200
to group with other people and I found that actually not every group is full of

02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:53.400
idiots a lot of them are many of them don't have proper grammar and they're

02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:58.520
very hard to understand but for the most part it's it's partly your support your

02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:04.160
support group outside of your pugs you know and people people sometimes just

02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:08.060
are kind of weird online like I admit like okay I play with my friend Matt who

02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:10.880
is grandpa Warcraft on Horde house if you ever listen to him and when we

02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:16.400
group together he does the weirdest shit in instances like he's a friend of mine

02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:20.760
and I love them but oh my god like we'll start an instant so like we roll in

02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:23.680
instance together and it's the two of us and three random people and as soon as

02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:27.080
the instant starts he'll go like he'll say in party chat he'll say something

to send us a tweet at twitter.com slash olr or you can email us mailbag at

02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:49.000
orange laundry calm speaking of tweets I wanted to finish Tiger Claws thought

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:54.240
here apparently this is coming from a leak at the Sony booth at CES is showing

02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:59.440
on the PlayStation 3 something called play memory studio which will be excuse

02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:04.920
me well we're seeing it happen on radio a video editing suite for the PlayStation

02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:10.760
3 apparently you can put effects in video and kind of do some editing live

02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:14.640
on the PlayStation 3 that's kind of cool I guess I already thought the PlayStation

02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:17.640
did kind of allow some limited video stuff but that's cool if they're

02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.920
enhancing it especially if it's free I wonder if it'll be free I somehow doubt

02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:27.040
it Tom and one on Twitter sent us this and I saw this earlier this week cuz

02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:30.560

like a fan-edited thing with the mod of course

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:18.440

on my bed dancing in my pajamas to disco inferno okay I gave that to Rama for the

02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:09.280

02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:29.560
tweets us saying it's 2012 and we have a shitload of video game sequels coming

02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:36.800
what games do you think don't deserve a sequel and should just die what games

02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:41.120
don't deserve a sequel and should just die how about the Imagine series imagine

02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:49.120
babies there was one last year for the 3ds that was it one I think Holly would

02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:56.080
say the puss in boots game the puss in puts puss in boots series absolutely

02:51:56.080 --> 02:52:03.720
puss in puts tiki a tight tiki I hope I'm saying that right and chat says

02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:06.440
Elder Scrolls just throwing it down saying there's too damn many Elder

02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:10.040
Scrolls games I'm gonna go on next year is pretty fun yeah you won't have

02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:13.640
another Elder Scrolls game 2012 that's you'll have expansions for Skyrim that's

02:52:13.640 --> 02:52:26.720
for sure yeah for sure I franchises that need to die oh god I like part of you

02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:31.680
wants to be cynical and say the Just Dance series but parties they can be

02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:37.840
kind of fun so I can't really think of anything because honestly if I don't

02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:40.840
want to play them I just don't know that they exist that's kind of where I'm at

02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:45.160
is like I don't think a lot about the games that I don't want to play you know

02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:48.520
I could be super cynical go Call of Duty because I don't play those games but I

02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:55.840
realize other people do play those games I'm kind of looking over at my own

02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:00.360
collection how about Tetris remakes yeah that's another one I'm getting sick

02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:03.760
last dress was kind of fun but that's back in the super scope days apparently

02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:06.760
that 3ds one's pretty good but it's still the same fucking game we've been

02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:14.880
playing forever it might be time for the need for speed series to die maybe that

02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:20.920
would be another answer I would have well or at least of all that or

02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:25.720
something I don't know I can't yeah I really can't think of anything offhand I

02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:31.320
wonder what our chatters think it chat maybe Saints Row car her her no no yuki

02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:36.080
says cooking mama that's actually a really good answer yeah just the mama

02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:41.280
series in general it it's not doing well I that's a very good answer I can stand

02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:48.560
with yuki on that one yuki also says sonic games no because generations yeah

02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:52.320
I need this game but then I need sonic generation there's admittedly there's

02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:57.040
been a lot of crap yeah and I don't I think that sonic 4 was kind of a I will

02:53:57.040 --> 02:54:01.640
give you one that's just and it is a somewhat major game coming out this year

02:54:01.640 --> 02:54:09.680
okay Silent Hill I think I kind of agree non konami Japan produced Silent Hill

02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:15.240
games specifically me today yes to go back in house to Konami Japan I agree

02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:19.920
Silent Hill is kind of done and karaoke revolution American or karaoke revolution

02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:24.360
glee needs oh there you go winner everything how about everything to die

02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:30.880
but glee needs to get canceled all right last another tweet from Zen since I

02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:35.160
haven't read tweets from Zen before I will read two tweets tonight Zen says if

02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:40.680
PlayStation 4 Xbox lube and the Nintendo Wii U were all coming out on the same

02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:47.520
day and you could only get one which system would you get too early I how can

02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:50.040
you answer that because we don't we don't know what the Xbox lube and the

02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:53.240
PlayStation 4 have to offer and we only know about half of what that we use

02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:58.800
really bring into the table so you'd be asking me to base that decision based

02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.880
off of the current consoles and the problem with that is the jump we made

02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:08.640
from the last realm of consoles right because when the systems first came out

02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:12.080
I would say the Xbox 360 was in a better position than the PlayStation 3 was when

02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:15.840
they first came out but yet if I had based my choice completely off that

02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:19.440
generation before this one the PlayStation 2 I think was better than

02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:27.120
original Xbox you know so it's just it's it's it's way too early to call I in

02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:30.640
here here's also the realistic in me is like well I'm going to end up with them

02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:33.480
all anyway because I have the sick addiction of video games and do this

02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:36.840
show and everything so it's kind of like I'm going to try to show some restraint

02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:43.120
at least maybe not buying one of the consoles if not to the console luck you

02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:47.160
know what though honestly with you would have played on the Wii and stuff I think

02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:52.360
it's gonna be pretty easy for the Wii U I think I say that now I guess I will

02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:57.000
humor the question and I'm going to say PlayStation 4 and the reason why I

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:00.440
because I just have the feeling out of the three systems it's going to be the

02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:04.520
most advanced because I think it's going to be the one that's in the incubator

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:07.320
the longest meaning I think it'll be the last of the three to come out so I think

02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:12.040
it's going to have the best processor in it and all that but again that doesn't

02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:15.160
necessarily make it the best but I literally have nothing else to go off of

02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:19.860
right now you know so that I'm going to say PlayStation 4 just to humor the

02:56:19.860 --> 02:56:26.280
question but that could change absolutely so alright that's it for the

02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:31.600
Twitter's tonight at twitter.com slash olr oh actually I see one oh never mind

02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:35.480

02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:39.960
followers and the app messages now it's really weird all right anyway um last

minute stories Loki dark soccer anything for last minute stories um no Loki um my

02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:51.640
story is that I had trouble finding a cage man sock thankfully I downloaded

02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:57.000

talking about best best games of 2011 mm-hmm it's not really a game but I have

02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:19.720
to recommend ready player one seriously if you haven't read it yet you need to

02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:23.200
read it because it's awesome and I mean if you're a fan of games especially a

02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:29.880

02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:36.400

02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:39.200
allowed to say this because it's it's out there post on the internet but

02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:42.400

with that movie there are things I loved about things I didn't like about it I

02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:56.400
think that's gonna be awesome because you know that theater is gonna be full

02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:00.640
of nerds that are into it you know and I think it's gonna be a great showing I

02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:04.800
want to I definitely I'm gonna see cuz I know the guys that are behind it through

02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:08.200

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:54.540
up once a year somewhere you know there's there's other movies that show

02:58:54.540 --> 02:58:57.100

02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:05.480

02:59:05.480 --> 02:59:09.040
downloading the show and tuning in to us hey if you like what you hear all we ask

02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:11.720
you know we don't put commercials in the show we don't make you buy things or

02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:15.920

comm is the website the forums are there if you want to post on the forums I have

02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:33.960
to say though right now it's locked down to new accounts because yeah we were

02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:36.800
really getting killed with spammers there so I just shut off accounts all

02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:39.320
together so hopefully within the next month or two we're gonna just totally

02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:43.560
revamp the forums and hopefully be able to avoid the spam bots if you really

02:59:43.560 --> 02:59:46.600
