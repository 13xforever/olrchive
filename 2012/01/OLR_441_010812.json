This table was loaded with paper Yes, it was It was the paper table How have you been, Loki? How was your holiday? Did you have a good time off? Yeah, it was alright I mean, we just Hung around the house for the most part Just, you know, Josh got a lot of gifts And, um In times that he's not awake, I'm playing Skyrim Very cool I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com And somebody just joined the chat named I love OLR Well, we love you I love OLR and chat says Swotore, or as I've been calling it on the other show Hoard House, Sweatore Sweatore leveling, which is of course The Old Republic, Star Wars Plus, OLR in the background equals Best Sunday night ever I gotta admit, that's how I like to listen to live shows I've tuned into some of the other all-game shows a few times Like Dead Pixel Live, Video Game Outsiders And I'll play WoW Because I've only been playing Sweatore for about three weeks But like, I'll play WoW and do PVP and listen to You know, Video Game Outsiders or whatever It's a good time I remember when my friend was working on Knights of the Old Republic And she was calling it Scrotore You know, it would be awesome if you could do that on the Xbox 360 You know, stream stuff in Like, you know, one of our live stations He has the custom, you know, playlists Didn't somebody create an app that did that some time ago? I can't remember there was an app years ago There was, it's the thing for downloading podcasts, sort of TVercity, TVercity Didn't that do it? Well, that, that you can You can stream stuff to your Xbox 360 But not in the background while you're playing stuff I believe I don't know I don't know about that, maybe you can I thought one of them did internet radio Maybe you can do that with TVercity I know, I just use it for videos So I don't really, I've never messed with the music part of it I know this would never ever happen But wouldn't it be nice if AllGames.com Could get one of those little channel things That you could install and have I mean, iHeartRadio, the Clear Channel thing has one I mean, they have millions and billions of dollars But AllGames totally has a 20 somewhere Maybe in the couch I mean, AllGames should be able to get that, right? Anyhow Let's see, Loki, we gotta do some catching up here You were out last week, and last week was the big show We were talking about our top games of 2011 Because we never really had a proper year-end show Because of the way the holidays fell this year And we all were speculating What is Loki's top three games of 2011? Hey, come on, it's gonna be super easy Dark Soccer and I guessed We actually, we already have a listener of mine I think I remember, I remember three and one Oh yeah, yeah, I think, I don't remember Maybe one of the listeners will remind us in the chat room What we had picked, but I don't wanna say Because I don't wanna influence, so we'll wait Loki, let's hear your top three games So number three, what did you think was the third best game of 2011? You know, I don't know, because I didn't play a lot of games In 2011, sadly, because I just I was really playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto the whole Well, for the most part, up until recently But that's not, that didn't come out in 2011 So that doesn't count We did allow, it was, the criteria was Your top game of the year And that might not actually be a game that came out this year Because so many good games come out at the end of 2010 Or in Alan's case, he put Dragon Age Origins as his number two game of the year Because he just started playing it this year And we said, okay, you're allowed Every gamer gets their voice, even if it's a tardy voice Well, that's tough, and I would say I mean, Grand Theft Auto was pretty awesome And, I mean, it was nice to be able to play the mods again Briefly, until they patched it again I would say probably my number three would be Call of Duty Modern Warfare, I guess All right, we called it Did we call it? I think we did, yeah Yeah, Modern Warfare It's just fun now And especially because, you know, the whole reason we switched to that game Is because my co-workers were very pissed Or tired of me beating them in Grand Theft Auto And they're just like They're just like, oh, we gotta switch it up, we gotta play a game You know, my boss Oh, I've played Call of Duty, you know I think I should be a little bit better than Loki is at that Unfortunately, what they found out And, see, I didn't play a lot of Call of Duty at all I mean, I've literally, before we started playing it I'd played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1 once Once split screen, and that was it And I didn't really care for it the first time we played it But I ended up being really good at it, apparently And a lot better than them And they are pissed Because it didn't help And it's actually been a lot worse now Because I'm so stealthy in that game That I'll just sneak up behind them and do something funny And they'll be like, hey, hey And then kill them Alright, so you like this game because you can own the shit out of everybody It's pretty fun It's actually, Call of Duty, at least the Modern Warfare games and stuff I mean, they really cater that stuff Especially the multiplayer portion But they really have it down pat And it's smooth, it works well And it's just very fun and streamlined It's good That's not a series of games I'm not really into the war games I'm terrible at first person shooters unless it's called Quake But you know what though And I agree, playing it online Like free for all deathmatch Not very fun Playing it team deathmatch online That's a lot of fun Well yeah, I watched I didn't talk about this last week But I actually watched over the holiday We were with some of Alan's family And some of his brothers were playing Modern Warfare 3 And I was kind of watching them like, wow, it looks really good And they were doing this interesting playback thing Where he was showing us a video Where his whole team hid in a bus And the other team was looking for him everywhere And couldn't find him And it took him like 10 minutes or something To find the team that was in the bus Because this one guy inadvertently stood up I get why people are into this It's actually a pretty fun game There's a lot of haters A lot of hate for Modern Warfare And I can't really speak for 2 and 3 Because I haven't played 2 and 3 So I don't know how much they've changed But I can only imagine it's about as much as they've changed From Call of Duty 2 to 3 Which wasn't a whole lot It was just pretty much They have the game and that's it I know a lot of it's catered towards multiplayer nowadays But you know what? It's pretty fun I like what they were talking about That they were doing with the elite services I can see where people would like that But my whole thing before was Just getting into online actually playing free for all death matches And stuff It doesn't seem very fun And I've actually played it And I don't know, there's still a lot of people cheating online You run into a lot of people running infection mods And stuff like that But Team Deathmatch actually doesn't seem to be plagued with that crap So it seems a lot more fun that way And I actually do pretty well Considering I'm ranked 5 That's pretty low When you consider there's 11 Well, 11 prestigious Or 10 prestigious And you can level up again on 10th prestige And 55 levels per And people actually do level up I'm not sure if everyone does it legitimately So it's fun Let's move on to your number 2 choice Number 2, best game of 2011 It's tough because this game A couple weeks ago Might have been number 1 But it's not Because it's kind of like It's kind of like an actual person Sort of, Elder Scrolls Skyrim 2 for 2, Dark Sakura And the reason why Elder Scrolls Skyrim is number 2 And not number 1 Is because the longer you play it The worse it gets And it's not necessarily that the game is getting worse It's just it's getting buggier It's just it took an arrow to the knee It's seriously getting buggier and buggier That meme needs to die right now Right now It needs to self inflict an arrow in its own knee I want to know why there's no representing the love For, there's a guy that says He took a sword to the chest Huh? I don't see any sword to the chest Yeah, let me say arrow to the knees guy, you sound like a pussy Sword to the chest? You don't come back from that He did apparently So Yeah, it's gotten progressively buggier In fact I was complaining about it the other day on Facebook Um There's a quest I can't finish now because The NPC for the quest is spawned under the map And I can't get to them It's literally in a spot that is inaccessible Alan got a pretty amazing bug this week I should have him come on and explain it I'm gonna butcher this Hopefully he hears, oh here he comes, yeah Alan hears me struggling What kind of Skyrim bug you got this week? So when I go to Whiterun, which is the main city in the center The first major city you go to I'm not a criminal I don't have a bounty I could talk to guards, they're like, oh hey sup bro Like you're orcish armor I go into Dragon's Reach where the Jarl is And right when I go up the stairs The Jarl and his bodyguard are like Oh shit, get him And like the whole room agros And I'm like, I'm dead, I didn't do anything So I left And I just did other shit for like 8 hours And I went back And it's fine It's fine now, so I can use the enchanting table in there But I was like, that was weird Magically fixed itself, fantastic I love this comment in our chat room Zenthral says, the guy that invented that mem The arrow to the knee thing, needs to take a sack to the chin Okay The arrow to the knee thing, yeah We get it, the NPCs Repeat themselves a lot Hell, I mean all the shopkeeps say the same thing too Some consider this trash I consider them treasures Well considering how fucking vast that game is though I mean I don't know It's just It's It's getting incredibly buggy And to the point where it's actually breaking the game But I mean It's still fun, I'm still playing I had to kind of force myself not to play this week So I can get some other stuff done Because I have over 85 hours in the game now And although I have exploited pretty much every glitch possible in the game To level myself up to the point where I can't die anymore And I kill everything in one hit And it's still fun And I can sneak up right to somebody in plain daylight And be standing right in front of them and they can't see me Which is kind of fun But yeah, the fact that I can't finish that quest That sucks, and the fact that sometimes Parts of the land don't spawn And I can't, you know, I fall through them Or uh Other fun stuff, oh Sometimes when you kill a dragon or whatever It'll do one more lap around the sky and then crash epically You know, it's just like Really? You have to do that You can just die and fall to the ground Alright, so despite all the crappy bugs It's still your number two game of the year because I played it a lot And I'm still playing Alright, your number one game of twenty I mean, come on Seriously, you gotta ask What is your number one game of 2011? Let's say it's World of the Third Ah, three for three, right there Actually, didn't we go back and say though That Earth Defense Force was gonna end up number three? Yeah, but then we allowed the old game rule Yeah, alright See, if it wasn't the old game rule I probably would have been number three Only by default because They sucked And Earth Defense Force, it was all right It was pretty fun for a while, but man It's pretty boring now They promised, oh, we're gonna deal with this TLC It's gonna be so fucking awesome And nothing Why Saints Row the Third? It's such an over the top game It's just incredibly fun It was everything I wanted that game to be And more Honestly, I wanna finish it And get all a thousand achievement points But I just, once again, there's A buggy portion of the game And it happens to be kind of like the terrible part of it Where you have to do these car jacking things And steal certain cars To unlock stuff It's on their Saints book thing It's just broken And if it wasn't broken I probably would be done with that Well, with all the achievements at least Sad there wasn't any competitive multiplayer in it I mean, that's kinda lame I do really wanna play the Co-op in it I think that would be pretty fun I do have to play through it again now As a woman so I can get the other achievements And the DLC I'm looking forward to it Although I'm not too optimistic On if it being really good Cause the new, like from the achievements That were leaked out for the Upcoming stuff It just sounds like a bunch of extra excursions And some of it, I mean, that would probably be pretty fun But, you know The activities It's cool doing them sometimes But I don't like being forced to doing them I would rather have some actual missions to the game But it just sounds like it's all activities So, we'll try it I mean, it'll be alright But I'm not gonna be one of those persons And I haven't been I'm not gonna be one to buy every single piece of download content Just because I like the game That's not how I'm gonna do it Alright, so you're number one game of the year Number three, and then you proceeded to slam each game There it is, your top three Of the year Can you get, Dark Soccer and I Have the same game as number one, can you guess? The same game as number one World of Warcraft? No Good guess though Star Wars the old No, I'm not playing that I showed Dark Soccer it for five minutes And she was like, I don't get it No, I got it, I just didn't really care Number one game Better not be something like The Sims Social No, God no Think more, it'll be easier to guess her Here's a clue Oh, it's you How have you been? I've been really busy being dead Oh my God, I forgot Portal 2 Fuck that, Call of Duty is out of this See, that's what happens when that comes out way too early Call of Duty, fuck it Move them all back Portal 2 number one, all the rest can be Skyrim number three Saints Row the Third So there we go, so after Some coercing, we finally get Loki to agree So it's official, the official OLR game of 2011 Is Portal 2 I played through that game what, four times all the way through? It's great I completely forgot that that game came out This year, and that's really bad Because I think a lot of the Game of the Year stuff, I mean a lot of people Talked about Portal 2, but I literally forgot that that came out this year Well, and you know I actually have that, oh, it's you Memorized very well, because that's my Message tone on my phone now Yeah, so I mean, yeah, Portal 2 For sure I completely forgot I feel so bad But seriously, where the fuck is Where the fuck is some DLC for that? They had some of the stuff on the PC Any other guesses What might have been on our list? Technically Um Final Fantasy XIV Hell to the no That would be in like three biggest Disappointments of the year Super Mario 3D Land You got it, it was my number three Mario Kart 7 Arkham City was my number two Arkham City was my number three What was your number two? I forgot Um Hold on, I actually have No, I I'll have to check on my hard drive Because I Spazinator says the number one game was Singstar Abba L-O-O-J-K I know what my, um Wrong, it's not Singstar Abba, it's Abba, you can dance He was so hilarious playing that No, but they also have Singstar Abba on the PS3 I know that I remember that Tiara was in town when you got that And we came and played it at the old house But, um I know what my honorable Mention was, Fractal Because that game is cool Fractal is a really neat puzzler Alright, oh Marvel vs. Capcom Yeah, Marvel vs. Capcom Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 It just hit me, all of a sudden Alright, let's Uh, quickly, our intro is running a little long I wanted to just quickly say something about this Because, Loki, you tweeted it to me I've had listeners tweet me more stories About this whole Xbox hacking stuff And, god, we've been talking to our Blue in the face about it since August You know, if you don't know by now Uh, I was hacked back in August And people were saying, oh, you let Your password get out, oh, you got phish Microsoft's saying, oh, you got phish, I'm like, no I'm a little smarter than that in the websites I visit But, no, apparently it was my own damn fault Well, now that more and more people are getting hacked And more and more people are having problems with Microsoft Finally, it's getting out there, some gal has set up a Tumblr Where she was sharing her experiences For some reason, it caught wildfire And I think a lot of it is because She had screen caps with Xbox support She was screen capping the emails And it gave a lot of the gaming press, I guess, for whatever reason They're really, really bored What really was taking me off this week And you linked me an article from IGN That literally said nothing Literally said nothing, it said, yeah Xbox is claiming that they're getting hacked But, Microsoft says They have no comment on the situation So, you know And apparently This guy on this website Was the first to break the news A couple weeks ago, and it's like That's kind of insulting When we were here in August, talking about I'm not saying we should, that's not what I'm saying Because there were probably way other people Before me, in fact I know people who were hacked Before me It's just irritating That it's not news until it happens to somebody Who has Listen, just because a dude works in an office For a company that makes a lot of money Doesn't mean he's any better than any other blogger I mean, there's a lot of really stupid ass posts That are on a lot of major websites IGN Especially That have not a lot of research in there And, I mean, I think they got The comment from, what is it Steven Toulouse, or whatever his name is Support, I don't know what the hell he is Something that Xbox put That customer service related I'm not going to touch on Blowing the Fate Go listen to that last show from 2011 Episode number four How old night are we on tonight? 441 Go listen to 439 Would have been the last one from, we had Justin on Who was talking about how he got Broken into twice Go, I mean, that's really all you need to hear And I don't want to keep talking about this But seriously, if you have not changed your password At this point, do not Microsoft is swearing up and down That they're doing everything They're being ignorant That's really the only word Microsoft is ignorant EA is ignorant The higher ups in those companies are ignorant To the situation that's going on right now Your money is at risk if your credit card is on your account I have been sitting here telling you this Blue in the face since August Change your F and password, it's not that hard to do Use a unique password on Xbox That you don't use anywhere else Put, like, put XB at the end of it Or something, or put, you know MS with a dollar sign Just make something that differentiates it For the record, neither of us have been hacked It's, it's, the thing is though Is, once again, they Um, but They're right, and they're wrong at the same time I think Dan always paid with points cards And also, hundreds and thousands Of people have been, you know And including people I know that haven't touched Their Xboxes in forever Well, I'm just saying it's safer to Pay with points cards The only card I have ever had on there Was one that I knew was gonna expire in a month that I wasn't Gonna renew I would still change your password You might have people in there downloading What they can do, they can transfer They might not charge anything, but what a lot of them Have been doing, have they been logging In and then downloading the licenses To their local Xboxes And basically siphoning all your games Which can cause you headaches later on I'm just saying Well, I've checked all my licenses and they're still on mine But I've also never had gold on my Account either Now, Microsoft's not I wouldn't say they're ignorant But what their statement is true It's just, okay Here's what it is They're saying basically two things One, Live.com has not been compromised And two, that People are being phished And that's how their Credentials are being Leaked out or compromised There's two things that are I mean, yes, true They are not Live.com is not compromised But people are not being phished The whole thing was All this stuff is coming from the hacks That happened a while back and I even think it was The anonymous stuff where they were dumping A bunch of, and it might not even necessarily Be them, but something similar to The fact where they dump the email passwords Combos From random forums Or even gaming websites or whatever EA may have even been one of those, I don't know I think EA is the weak link And I've been saying this for forever Why does every single hack seem to come back To one of the EA games And I get FIFA 12's gold pack thing Where they're taking the cards and trading with other accounts That whole thing, I get that But why, if All these accounts are being sold on a Polish Website or all these accounts Are being bought and sold on there Why are they not selling accounts With other games too Why does it always come back to FIFA Because FIFA is a popular game In other countries There's other popular games in other countries Why is it always freaking FIFA But the DLC for FIFA is a lot more Expensive than buying a map pack for Call of Duty Or something Where there's smoke there's fire and it seems like FIFA is the common thing between All this, there's something about that game Or EA servers that are allowing this to happen EA sells a lot of garbage DLC People buy it And it's worth more That's really what it's coming down to But it doesn't matter You should be using a unique password And email combination On Xbox That's pretty much what You have to do Let's assume that even Right now they're claiming Phishing What evidence do they have that there's actual phishing Going on? They have no evidence They're just making assumptions Because all they know is It's gotta be phishing But what they should do is Listen, hey, you know I think I've seen one of them say that Someone that was associated with Xbox said, hey, you know There were these hacks that happened A lot of this email password Combos got out And what they're doing In fact, Anonymous said to do this When they leaked this crap out Try it in Facebook, try it in Yahoo Try it in Gmail, try it in Twitter Use these login credentials To get in access to other people's stuff Because these people should be changing their accounts Because these websites got hacked So that's what it is You need to change that stuff Because if you use the same email And password combination Or even username password For every single website that you visit Then you're gonna If someone gets one of those, they've got them all Alright, so again We've spent way too much time talking about this In the past on the show If you tweet me and say My Xbox got hacked, I'm gonna tweet you back And say, I'm really sorry to hear that But I told you to change your password in August Now if you tweet me back and say, I changed my password Back in August, I really do want to hear those Because then that would prove Something fishy's going on I'm not talking fishing But if you haven't Changed your password by now I don't know what else to tell you Like, the evidence is out there It's growing And finally, the mainstream press Is coming around And telling you to change your password too So just do it Even though Microsoft and EA and all of them are refusing to admit there's a problem It's clear that there's a problem Alright Let's see Moving on I want to talk about our gaming weeks And we always like to start off the show Even when it's really 30 minutes into the show Talking about what video games have you been playing this week There's been things that you've been playing DarkSakura, what have you been up to? Well, I have been playing WoW But I've been reading books WoW books And I was at Goodwill Someone had the first two books of the War of the Ancients series And I was like, I'm kind of a lore nerd I'll read them They're really well written I mean, I can A lot of books that you get that are tie-ins to series Are kind of like, oh meh These are actually really good books And that's just reading it You know, in between times Really good books I also Played some Fractal And I installed Bastion I haven't played it yet But it's really been Fractal and WoW And we picked up DJ Hero 2 today The girl installed the game But she couldn't find the time We got DJ Hero 2 today The bundle set For 20 bucks at Big Lots So that's what tomorrow was Woohoo bargaining I know, right And I've also been playing Scare Shermie Which was I finally figured out how to sneak up on Shermie Vacuum something in front of her She's too busy staring at it In absolute horror You can actually sneak up on her And she'll jump I think I saw a tweet Or a chat comment or something earlier That said, I miss Shermie There are two cats here In this studio, but they're afraid of people They like to run and hide So they're currently probably under my bed Maruko loves me Yeah, but they don't know Loki And so they're probably like, who's that guy Maruko was sitting next to me, cuddling While I was reading He walks around with his tail in the air, showing off his butt Look at my butt And I was getting the occasional stink eye From Sanrio Yeah, mostly, and I was reading those books here By the way, reading them here And looking at your video games, seeing which ones I was gonna run off with Not really I was out of town, by the way, Disneyland Mostly, it's just been That we've still been arranging a lot of stuff from the move So we haven't had A significant amount of time Also, the issues with my hand are getting worse again So I can't really sit down And play for very long Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week? Well This week I didn't really play much Because I play Call of Duty at work Which is fine Like I said, my coworkers are trying Multiple ways to get me to Not be as good Including, as of Friday They taped a piece of cardboard To my monitor with a few random holes poked in it And of course, you know Blocking about 90% of the monitor I still managed to stealth kill A few people with a knife doing that But yeah, I could not aim and shoot At anybody because there was nothing in the direct center So it made it very difficult to Try to actually shoot somebody Um And then, um Let's see what else Oh, and I played Skyrim Earlier in the week But I, you know, stopped Playing it this week just so I could get some Other stuff done because every time I'm like Well, I could work on this, or I could play Skyrim I want to play Skyrim And I started going through Some of the Thief Guild stuff I started a Quest in Winterhold And It crashed Well, the quest crashed because Apparently if you do something out of order in that Quest, it breaks You know, something that would be very obvious To anybody that tested the game But I don't think anybody tested the game Or there's too damn much to test That's also probably part of the problem There's too much damn stuff to test But you would think that the first things they would test Would be, I don't know, the quest from the game I mean, obviously They can't test If you step on this rock over here And you get launched into space Or something like that, because there's a lot of Landmass to go wander around and test Every single random event that would happen But I would think an actual quest In the game Um, it would be very obvious That it's not working correctly But I don't care I don't have to finish that quest I'm not a necessarily completionist in this case But it's just still annoying though That something like that would break I mean, I don't mind if like You know, a A character gets trapped in a wall or something like that Okay, I did mind that a little bit And I had to reload a few times, but It's just, it's getting to the point now Where I'm actually starting to get the Frame stutters and stuff like that Like, it's stopping Going, stopping, and going And I have to stop moving for a second For it to catch up That's not good, that's the PS3 crap That, you know, is going on right now I think I might try to get back into some Skyrim this week We'll see, because I've kind of, I'm a little MMO'd out right now But I'll get to my own week in a minute Yes we do That would make WoW more interesting And I'm not really sure if we want to talk about it right now But I've also, like I told you That I've been, my coworkers Have been finding ways to try to Hinder my gameplay in Call of Duty Let me set this up a little bit Because this is one of the stories we didn't talk about A lot last week, because it seemed like it was everywhere And it's not really a story It was really something that caught Fire in a non-news Week, I mean, yes, the Guy was an idiot, but it was just That guy got taken to the cleaners It was just like, really? This is how bored We are, but it's Obviously we're talking about the ocean marketing thing And the whole controller that they were promoting Was the Avenger Now, I think we can all separate the controller From the situation And this one guy with the ego However, ironically enough Loki had procured a copy Of this controller We've had one of these for months now And was ready to review it on the show When this all happened So, Loki, go ahead, the Avenger controller now Okay, the Avenger controller It's basically, I mean Different spins I've heard on it One, yes, it's created by a guy I think he was a teacher or something like that And his reasoning behind it Was, oh, I wanted to make Something that made games a little bit More accessible for People with disabilities or something like that Because he knew somebody that had trouble With a range of motion or something like that So they had Issues reaching The buttons or something I don't know what the case may be But that said, though, the way they're Marketing it is not necessarily You know, oh, this is for people That have disabilities Or, oh, yeah, and if you have disabilities That would be good, too, but no It's supposed to be something that actually Decreases the amount of Latency Between your reaction And hitting the buttons And the way they do that is by putting these Extra arms above The X, Y, and B buttons These arms reach out over Behind the trigger and kind of On the middle of your finger For the B button as well Am I doing this right? I'm holding this right now You kind of lift up? Yeah, you're supposed to lift up and it's supposed to hit the button It's a little interesting You can adjust those arms, too Because that's adjusted for me right now You're supposed to hit up And then for the triggers now You can see on the triggers There's a rubber band thing that goes underneath the bottom You're supposed to pull up on the bottom With your finger to pull the trigger Because the way they have it It's tightened to the point now where It's just to the point where It's going to trigger the actual Button On the actual trigger That's supposed to cut down The amount of time it takes you To Press the trigger buttons It doesn't make you better in games Because you're hitting buttons faster And your reaction time is faster That's all good on paper But it doesn't work that way, unfortunately Because you have to retrain yourself To play games And it's actually very fucking awkward To play with that It was harder to play Call of Duty And I gave it I think I gave it a fair amount of time I'd say a total of about About five hours worth of gameplay That I played during lunches On Call of Duty with that I played during our Morning and afternoon And deathmatch games and stuff like that And I still was alright But it was just a hassle Especially trying to trigger certain buttons And I don't really I mean, Call of Duty I don't think a lot of people really need to hit The face buttons fast Because it's like, reload Yeah, okay, reload Or like switching weapons or crouching You don't really need that I'm really curious, though, about the So obviously you just find it awkward And I gotta admit, when I'm holding it I don't really play shooters, though For me, this would not be an advantage But accessibility is a big thing About this dark soccer I'm really curious what you think Having your hand issues It's really my first two fingers And the things that I really don't like all this crap on top of it But I like the two extensions On the triggers And you see how there's a rubber bandy thing? You can also tug on that And that triggers it, too But this actually is much more comfortable To my finger because I don't have to Have it up and put my hand in an awkward position The whole problem I have with the triggers Is that I have to move my hand Much higher up to reach them And if I had something that Would work for The top two triggers instead of the back one Like this long piece It would be very comfortable for me So like a half Avenger would be really good For dark soccer? Well, unfortunately, the part that you can take off the Avenger Are the actual trigger buttons I don't know what they call them, paddles Or whatever the hell on the back there Those are the things you can take off If you don't like Pulling on the actual skis Or whatever the hell that's called Derek H. in our chatroom at chat.orangesonshade.com Says, Loki should tape three of his fingers together To simulate how it is supposed to be used So Honestly, it's a waste of money To be honest I think I want one My opinion is it's a waste of money See, it's very, very interesting So like for you The normal controller doesn't bug you But for her, she's like Okay, now I can see maybe something that might Let me play games a little longer You should just give her yours But here's the thing though Jamie, you're having trouble hitting some of the These would need to be adjusted Okay, but the buttons that you have trouble Hitting are the shoulder buttons, right? Yeah Okay, well they have controllers that have Remappable buttons that would be on the bottom Of the controller that you would hit with One of your middle fingers You drop Siri On the On this controller It's just the problem is $50 first off For not a controller They call it a controller, it's not a fucking controller It's a piece of shit that attaches to a controller If it were a controller, I would be able to take this off And play with just this And it would work just fine $50 for that's a little steep I mean, and really I understand that there could be uses for it As far as People Like they said right here The rocker They said players with larger or smaller hands May utilize the rocker for added Comfort With smaller or larger hands What's it meant for? I mean, I don't understand Comes equipped with an Optional stabilizing stand Tension straps and trigger skis These are called trigger skis apparently And they suck, they do not work I've tried pulling the trigger using this It does not work, I mean Really what would make the controller In general better for me Is just to extend the top to where the two triggers Are further back They have also these Sticker things that I pulled off of here already Because I'm planning on reselling this Because it's a piece of shit They had one that plucked And that's the other thing too You'll notice that there's actually the triggers for all the buttons Except for the A button You still have to move your thumb off of here To push jump And it's recessed because now there's this hunk of garbage On top of the controller To hit the A button So their solution is there's a sticky pad That you can put on top of there So not worth the price at all It's not worth the price But maybe an accessibility thing Maybe if you have issues You might want to try one Honestly I think it could be done better If it's an accessibility thing I think it could be done better And if you're having trouble hitting If you want something that's gonna hit these Face buttons or whatever I'd recommend if you're playing Call of Duty They had one either for Modern Warfare 2 Or Black Ops They had a controller with two It was from Mad Catz with two buttons on the bottom That were mappable to either the Left stick, right stick, or L3, R3 And then the four face buttons And you can hit those buttons On the bottom Using, I guess it would be Let me see here It would be probably with your middle finger To hit those buttons on the bottom And that's actually not too bad Because the comfort goes So that would be my recommendation And that, for 50 bucks, you actually get a controller That you can use straight out of the box and go This is $50 Plus you have to have a $60 Controller to plug it on top of So it's $110 And I love their website And this is another reason for me to hate G4 But I love their website Because they have a bunch of different Reviews on it And one of them was from G4 This and the controller from Evil Controllers Which is ironic because this controller I have in here is a modded controller From Evil Controllers Yes, and they're fucking expensive So I don't recommend buying them because it's not You can get it way cheaper and stuff But they're still nice They're like Their review And this is Adam Sessler on fucking X-Play Their review was We don't like the Evil Controllers because The rapid fire controller is cheating Well if you guys like cheating then That was their negative Review for Evil Controllers But we like this Avenger one because it's not cheating That was the reason they liked it So there's Your educated Review for that Interesting side though, did you hear G4 has a new president now It has to do with the whole Comcast G4 is a Comcast network and the whole Comcast NBC thing that's happening Interesting Because They were trying to pull With a lot of the stuff Well you know The Avenger was It was meant for people with Disabilities and stuff and they tried to swing That whole emotional like I've got to feel sorry for them and stuff They donated a child's play and stuff Because of this whole bad PR and the fact that They still haven't delivered these pieces of shit controllers Yeah I got one of these months ago so they were done They just haven't manufactured them I mean it's fucking plastic So I don't know why it's taking so long And that's And that's the way that they were marketing it Except the problem is It's not Avenger The controller to allow All gamers to play games Including those with disabilities Avenger! The ultimate gaming advantage And no I'm sorry it's not an advantage It's actually quite a disadvantage and I seriously I would recommend You know what if you're going to spend a lot of money on controllers Buy a professionally modded controller Or you know those actual The Mad Catz ones and they have the Ones for the major league gamers Or whatever that actually looked pretty cool And so I'd pick up one of the nicer Controllers instead of a $50 piece of crap Alright That's enough clearly we know how you feel About that Loki so that's enough Alright I gave it a fair share I mean I played for that for five hours and trust me I did not want to play for that You know long a time with that controller Which is terrible Alright my gaming week quickly I don't have a lot to really add Because there hasn't really been any new games to come out So it's been basically more Sweat Tour, Star Wars The Old Republic And Warcraft of course Because that's every week Randomly got an urge to play Super Mario World Am I weird? I have a Super Nintendo sitting right there in a Mario World cart Yet I've been playing it on the Wii I've been playing on the Wii with the classic controller And I've been doing that because you can Remember in Mario World you can only save after you beat Like a ghost house or a fortress But thanks to Wii save states Not really save states but you can just kind of hit the home button Anywhere and it remembers right where you're at So that's pretty cool Yeah so I've been playing that just old school A little bit and finally tried PVP In Sweat Tour And it was actually really fun I love the commentators Oh my god that part was really funny As you're playing there's actually live commentators Like you know oh they just killed A guy on the frog pants team They took him down it was just really funny Is Greg Proops in there again? No it's not Greg Proops Such a missed opportunity I mean he's not doing anything The frog knobs or something I don't know the teams have funny names What's he doing now he's like hosting some like Some weird news on Yahoo Or something like that I mean come on The guy's not doing anything right now No no no he's got his podcast it's great Smartest man in the world I would endorse that podcast I have to say I listened to it in Rob's car He can squeeze out some more voice work For a game come on Come on just throw some money his way he'd do it Alright um Let's see so that was really my gaming

On Facebook facebook.com slash orange Launch radio and we're also on Twitter twitter.com Slash OLR Alright let's get into Tonight's news Loki why don't you start Us off alright let's talk a little Bit about Atari And some of their I guess witch hunts Over Infringing IOS games apparently they're going after Everybody that has games that look like theirs And whether that you know they're just A blatant rip off of like say Asteroids or Breakout or something like that Or if it just happens to be you know A tank game with vector tanks you know In fact One indie app creator Black Powder Media They have a game That's been pulled Off of the App store because of Claims from Atari of Copyright infringement of course their game Is very similar I guess it looks Similar to Battlezone Vector tanks is the game And apparently They're going after everybody And you know Atari You know release the same instance For companies like Atari our intellectual property Portfolio is our Most valued asset While we have a great respect for any Development community and greatly appreciate The enthusiasm that they have for Our renowned properties we need to vigorously Protect our intellectual property And ensure that it's represented In a highly innovative Represent highly innovative Games okay well I gotta stop I'm right there Highly innovative games I'm sorry Your remake of centipede What is it the last the one that came out In the fall Last year it's terrible And not innovative in the least and What test drive Ferrari That's innovative to the you know test Drive franchise I'm sorry That's not true this is a Slippery slope though because like I I want to say okay yeah I Get it we see these knockoff games On the iOS devices and especially Android stuff all the time but Where do you draw the line because if you think About it couldn't any Shoot them up game any First person shooter couldn't anything Come back to combat If you really think about it Well like see I have a problem with The fact that you know okay it's a vector Game that has tanks in it I'm sorry But even I think in the arcades they had More than just battle zone I remember I remember an awesome PC game awesome awesome PC Game called specter that was Like a vector tank game but it was It was not I mean It was not battle zone like It was a step I remember the big thing about it Is you could do modem play and all this stuff which was huge You know when I was growing up and the whole reason They're doing this of course is because Because they have their own games that they're Releasing on the iOS marketplace And that's what it really comes down to I think Is that they just want to release it and Actually get some money for it but I mean let's be Serious here you know like Arkanoid And stuff like that I mean which Arkanoid isn't really There's actually was it Breakout Taito was But Breakout I mean that's Pretty much like Arkanoid Well Arkanoid is just a souped up Version of Breakout if you will It's got the falling things that you pick up That change the paddle I would say that that's more of like a genre Of games now less Of a you know because It kind of goes back to saying well You know there's fighting games And they're all clones of Street Fighter Well it's a genre now It's not necessarily yeah a lot of Stuff you know is inspired by Or is a clone of something and then they Kind of throw their own unique spin on it and there's That or there's the Games that are on the iOS a lot Of games out there that there's guys Trying to make a quick buck and they put some with the Angry Birds Characters they literally rip the assets From the game and then they create something else Or you know something that's like it's Angry cats and then there's dogs or something Or you just you know to the point where That's a rip off don't the masses Kind of know how to tell a cheap rip Off though well the masses do but see It reminds me of those CDs they sell at Target for like $5 that are like you know Top 40 hits and all it is it's like Really bad cover songs Of the stuff that's on the radio right now But like a lot of it Though it's kind of like One of those things you they have to try to Protect their rights or they lose their rights You know it so they kind Of have to do this but at the same time I think the reason they're doing this is because they're putting games Up on the iOS you know platform That you know I mean they recently released updated Versions of Breakout and Asteroids So I mean maybe that's why They're doing it but I mean okay I can't fault them for trying to do that And let's be honest there's a lot of shit On the app store that's Fucking just ripping off All sorts of shit I mean there's a ton Of rip off games out there And there's a ton of games inspired by Stuff like I would say Vector Tanks Is probably Somewhat you know Original game I mean yeah It's inspired by the old vector graphics And maybe inspired by Battlezone but it's not Like they're not calling it Tank Zone And you know it has you know basically All the same gameplay as Battlezone I just I don't know I think that They should be going out through the right people but they're Going out through everybody instead And at the same time why aren't the people there Making the Mario games and shit like that You know getting that stuff taken down To turn this a 180 A little bit this is what really worries Me about SOPA and that whole thing And why you know people are really scared Because if you allow corporations To kind of draw the line they're gonna draw It too far in the sand one way Oh they're gonna take out everything It's gonna be crazy If something like that actually passes You know I mean and all this Stuff that we see is just evidence of that Because Atari may overreach In trying to protect Their stuff and who's to say You know other companies do you trust A lot of these companies to draw the line Of course and here's A funny thing too like say for example I make a game or something that's pretty Original and I release it out there And Atari goes And I consider ripping Off some of my ideas Or something like that and that's not necessarily because they do that This game is too much like Custer's Revenge That Loki made and so We have the rights to this game Even though it was really a third party Let's say for example Here's an example that's not necessarily accurate But Was it the ferret tossing game Let's just say the ferret tossing game comes out And it's too much like Defender with the whole Scrolling left and right Too much like Defender or okay That's a bad example let's just say Say I release the game out there And all of a sudden you know Atari comes out Or not even necessarily Atari just some company Comes out and you know a major Company and puts out a game On iOS or something like that it's very Similar to my game like as far as all the Original aspects of that game it's very Similar to that I myself Go to Apple and say hey I want You to take this down are they gonna Do it probably not because this Major company that you know has a Lot more money invested into the app Store than I do and they're just probably gonna Ignore what I say yet if Apple comes and says hey we don't like Ferret tossing or whatever like that Even though it Vaguely resembles something that they may have done They will take it down without Who's gonna know where to draw the line Nobody is that Do you trust the government to draw the line Do you think senators And all them play video games I think one senator came out and said Well a lot of my staff does play Mortal Combat Like that was the most Video game keen thing I've ever heard No it was a Justice it was that Court case about the ESA versus The California law and all that that's where that Came out well I think you know to be honest I have A problem with you know if a lot of the People in government that They don't play games I mean honestly That's I understand that not everybody Plays games out there but I would I would assume nowadays that the vast majority Of the populace plays games in some Form or another not necessarily console Games but at least on the internet you know the Occasional Phone game or something like that And if these people representing us Don't have any fucking clue about What's going on out there They just don't care they'd be like well I don't Watch TV so why should I protect the rights of the People that want to watch TV I mean That's just not good We need to get these people out Anyhow tangent sorry about that but it's Important it's kind of stuff that's going on Right now anyhow Kind of going in a completely different direction here We mentioned earlier in the show that it Is kind of a slow release period there's not a lot Of games coming out until closer to the end of the month Of course you know Final Fantasy 13 2 It's slow release like B12 Yes but one game If a certain Best Buy store Is to be believed might just come out of nowhere And steal the spotlight for this first quarter and that's Diablo 3 according To Best Buy And this is again to be fair It's not the whole damn corporation it's one store That apparently was in Minnesota Where the Twitter user was That had a standee that said Diablo 3 Midnight opening available for Purchase 1201 AM on February 1st as the launch day and February by the way was spelled wrong Well there's been this whole Was it missing an R? There's this whole back F-E-B-U-R Instead of R-U February yeah which granted February's a tricky word is probably one of the more Common misspelled words but still Clearly not an official Blizzard Product if that's the case Now there was this whole back and forth that went on A UK retailer Kind of clarified the date too And showed a February 3rd date And then there was this whole Other back and forth where the Best Buy Was actually called by the gaming Press and that the sign was Actually taken down and then Bashyok one of the community Managers over at Blizzard actually said on Twitter lol We can't stop shops from doing whatever they want To do I'm paraphrasing here But retailers will find out when the rest of you do Basically when it's in an official Press release but certainly there's a lot of back And forth going on about the release date Loki you're on the inside a little bit You're shaking your head over there and then there's Micah Whipple That's Bashyok No they have not announced an official date yet You'll know when they do And I said this on Hoard House I truly think First off if they're going to street date something it's going to be on a Tuesday And not a Wednesday It's going to be March 27th The very last day of the quarter that they could do it I said I firmly believe that Because at this point with all the auction house back and forth that's been going on And that beta is still going They're going to want plenty of time for people To be able to pre-order Get those in and it's going to be carefully Timed with the Blizzard blood pact For Warcraft and the fact that You're going to have these Probably a million people getting it for free Because they're committed to WoW And they're going to drop it at a time where It's going to distract them from WoW Because nothing is going on in WoW So I think end of March is reasonable And they're also going to be starting Their marketing campaign which will be massive And so One month lead time is not enough So you will be You'll bet your ass that And know about it way before it comes out Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com Says, why do we have All this secret release date stuff? Just tell people, it's silly It's not secret, it's the fact that it's not done yet It's, Diablo 3 is fucking done It's fucking done and the problem is It has to do with the whole, it's the auction house thing That's getting tied up in Korea is part of it And now they're using this as an excuse To put more into the game Which is yet to be revealed But I think a lot of this is to Make sure that legally that auction house thing Gets clearance in all the countries I honestly believe that, I think this game should have been out Last year and I think they were going to announce it At Blizzcon for a December release And change their tune when Korea happened So, we'll see Virtual M in our chatroom says The website does list it as February 1st If you go to bestbuy.com But placeholder dates are super common, right? It's probably, if I remember correctly The last update we got from them Was Q1 2012 And that's kind of an You just place a placeholder date Usually, like, I used to put it on a weird date Like a Saturday or something like that in our system So that, you know, I know it's a placeholder date But yeah, there's no date for it yet In fact, from Yeah, I'm I'm 100% sure there's not an official date for it yet Although I haven't gotten an update from Activision in a while So probably next time I get it, you know Well, rumors are it could The release, the news of a release date Could be coming out Next week, as early as next week But I think a lot of that's wishful thinking On the community and how sometimes That snowballs into, oh, this is news now So, we'll see Probably what it was is a store jumped a gun And they built some, you know POP for the store And plus, if, and Virtual M says The website lists it as this That's actually, Virtual M probably just explained Where the issue came from Best Buy didn't get that date from From Blizzard They got it from themselves Probably in their own system And the store manager was like, oh, we gotta make sales for this Let's get a sign made up And we're gonna push more sales of this And it's February 1st in our system right here Props to them for being, you know Way to take initiative, but at the same time You need to spell Alright Let's move on to Dark Soccer With some other gaming news This is not a rumor Not a rumor It's about Kaz Harai Guess what? He's being promoted To president of Sony That was actually put up by Nikkei By the Japanese Stock Exchange He's going to be replacing Howard Stringer The theory is By April It should be going on, but they have to finish everything Through a board meeting And Stringer is staying on as The chairman and CEO Yeah, we get a lot more Ridge Racer and Giant Enemy Crafts But man Sony's kind of in Relatively crappy shape Well, first off Let me play this and then we'll come back In honor of Kaz Harai ascending to the throne At the top of Sony I think we have to play our very favorite clip From 2006 Please welcome Kaz Harai Ridge Racer The essence of the PlayStation DNA Is real change And the consumers are ready Genji 2 Is an Ashen game Which is based on Japanese history Ridge Racer Being based on history The stages of the game Will also be based on famous battles Which actually took place In ancient Japan So here's this giant enemy crab Ridge Racer And you Attack its weak point For massive damage It's Ridge Racer Ridge Racer PlayStation 3 will retail for $599 $599 $599 Giant Enemy Crab $599 $599 It's Ridge Racer Ridge Racer Don't forget old. That's Makah45 On YouTube by the way That has that clip up there I gotta, I gotta put this out there though There's actually a reason why I play that clip Because it does tie in all this It's not on the show role tonight But this story makes me think about How there's all of those news about the Vita Over in Japan is exhibitionally not doing well Like to the point, this was on Yahoo.News Where I saw this, so we're pretty, you know, mainstream site they're saying the Vita is bombing because the PSP outsold it in Japan last week so in other words that's pretty bad they sold more PSP's last week and they have the sales numbers to back it up that doesn't bode well for the Vita however look at that clip this is just history repeating itself all over again isn't it well it's too expensive the games are you know well you know hit miss I gotta well I gotta give them credit there is a lot of interesting stuff and I think a lot of people are really turned off by the price right now and in some ways I kind of see history repeating itself here I don't think I would write off the Vita as a horrific failure yet I mean it hasn't launched here in the US for one I don't know if it's gonna I think it'll sell more than PSP's do in the same week but I yeah I there's nothing I but I think the 3ds is gonna stare is nothing coming out for the PSP nothing I mean okay one game but it's it's a visual novel if I can also point out something last fiscal quarter Sony lost 1.6 billion yen which is about 20 million dollars or 13 million pounds so I mean I but but in my age well you never know like the PlayStation 3 everybody gave it shit in the beginning everybody gave it shit but it's come a long way and right now you know especially with everything we were saying with Microsoft at the top of the show PlayStation 3 is it's a pretty good system right now you know it really depends on the games you want the exclusives and all that but it's it's a worthy competitor the Xbox 360 I don't think anybody would have said that in 2006 and honestly I think we're like the 3ds and stuff I don't see them squeezing out a lot more power out of that system then the stuff that's out right now I mean sure there's gonna be some games that look pretty nice and can do a little bit more but if 3d is all they got I mean if you don't like the 3d you got a DS I mean that's pretty much it I'm not being a defenseless or a defensive or whatever or being a fanboy but I am saying hold on a minute because you know although I will great yes that looks very bad that the PSP was out selling the Vita but didn't I could be wrong but didn't the same thing happen with 3ds at first where eventually a couple months later the older DS was we're out selling the 3ds and now look where the 3ds is yeah I mean all it took was a few powerhouse games and now that nobody's joking about the 3ds everybody's like within a matter of months everybody's like okay yeah 3ds here to stay I mean no happening no one's arguing that the fact that the 3d the 3ds launch versus the Vita launch I mean the launch games are way better on the Vita there's actually stuff that people would like on there I'm probably not gonna get one at launch because it is too damn expensive and honestly I I don't I don't play my 3ds enough I mean fuck I've only played Super Mario 3d land once and I'm not gonna buy a new system game guru in our chat room says well yeah 3ds stole Monster Hunter which is what everyone bought the PSP for in Japan so you know that those few key games can really sell a system I mean you cannot deny that Mario 3d land and Mario Kart 7 is the reason why 3ds nobody's you know joking about it anymore and Monster Hunter in Japan certainly mm-hmm you know so anyhow all right so cause her I I mean it'll these things happen you know but don't buy Ridge Racer do not buy Ridge Racer for the Vita if you're going to buy a game for the Vita I seriously if you're trying to buy a cheap game if you're looking to buy a cheap game from Namco by touch my katamari because that's 30 bucks and you get a full game versus 30 bucks and get three tracks and five cars all my eyes and chat says but Sony doesn't have a system seller like Mario or Mario Kart they do have uncharted which is pretty big deal over here they have uncharted they have wiped out if you like wipe out they have well hot shots golf actually did pretty well in Japan it's not right I won't wipe out on the same level as Mario Kart I really wouldn't it's not at launch but well they have Modination Racers that's a launch title but that on the same level as Mario Kart I'm like Sony's big within our God of War uncharted well within a month a little big planet that that'll be big yeah luminous for me and and third-party games luminous I don't see as a launch sales well I haven't gotten Ubisoft updates yet but I haven't seen any there to launch stuff but in third party stuff I mean you've got ninja Ninja Gaiden Sigma I mean that's a pretty hardcore game ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 blaze blue extent or blaze blue continuum shift extent there's the MMA game from 505 supremacy MMA I know there's a FIFA game and you know Ridge Racer touch my katamari which looks pretty good there's a lot of good games it's it's not like where huh well let's see there's Nintendogs and a submarine game oh and pilot wings steel diver all right Rama in our chat says if Sony knocked the price of the Vita down to $1.99 they wouldn't need a system seller per se that maybe losing a lot of money yeah that's I guess that's true but don't isn't it common to lose money on systems you make it back up with the games yes the Vita the Vita does have a lot that's not just games that's another thing you know it does have strengths in just like the PSP had the web browser had the mp3s people call into the show on their PSPs I mean you know let's see ah my eyes agree is true if they knock the price down to $1.99 I would buy it and Yuki follows it up with same so the price is yeah they're not gonna lose $100 in every system I mean that's just stupid I mean it's stupid but at the same time I think it's fucking retarded that I've got to buy another memory card that doesn't come with the system I mean help the original PSP I think came with a 32 megabyte memory card I agree that if they wanted to get they would put a small memory card in yeah like I really need to even half not even half a gig but like let's do a 1 gig card I mean those things cannot be the price to manufacture that they're charging I don't think they would be taking a big loss by throwing one in and I think they were really sweet in the pot because I sir I kid you not every single one of those games requires a memory card and so here's here's a fun situation I go buy a Vita and they're sold out of memory cards fuck I can't play anything all right we got to move on we're running long in part a let's move on with some more news Loki it's just like a great plan right there I guess what apparently there's some insiders that say that there's going to be the new unveiling of a new Xbox and new PlayStation this e3 and they apparently have it from a very very very very very very very very reliable source and this is MCV reporting this as well that both of their these new consoles boom will be making their debut at e3 I'm not surprised I'm not sure if obviously though that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna be out this year or even next year I mean it could be I could see him coming out maybe fall next year I call bull on this story because I I would believe the Xbox I I think it's about time for the Xbox to show off their next console but I don't think PlayStation 4 I don't think we need it yet I feel like PlayStation 3 took so long to get to its prime I I almost kind of believed the whole 10 year cycle thing I think I think PlayStation 4 coming out this this soon is showing it this year I don't know I I Rob I think it's it's a Vita they've got to push the Vita they've got to push that through the holiday you don't understand though Rob a 10-year cycle doesn't necessarily mean that boom after 10 years they would launch a new console it means that they launch a new console and it overlaps for three years I just III in my gut you know just says they either can't be the PlayStation 4 this early it's just too damn early for the PlayStation 4 it's a reliable source so it's so reliable the stories in the reliability I mean it's so reliable I want to get their quote because it was it was hilarious ah nope don't have the quote oh well there's one guy's like I can guarantee it a hundred percent it's gonna be there you know it's gonna be there the Wii U and my disappointment actually you know what I'd be interested easy with this what's gonna happen next week during you know the whole cuz CES stuff CES is never really gaming I mean well no it was gonna be there with the Wii U yeah but they swear up and down it's just the same the exact same thing they showed at e3 for people who weren't able to wait in that horrifically long line yeah and I don't think they need to I mean CES really isn't a gaming show what the biggest game news I can think of that ever came out of CES was the Microsoft Game Room was a big thing that came out it and unfortunately Microsoft Game Room didn't last which is such don't get me on that game room had so much freaking potential and now it's like ruined it for everything else like I'm just I'm so mad about game room because it could have been so much more awesome and really should have been but anyway no I think I think the big things Windows 8 you know you'll see more stuff about PC and in bigger TVs and 3d TVs and all that I don't I don't think it's a lot about gaming consoles you might see little things especially from Microsoft and the 360 because they're really trying to make the 360 this whole like centerpiece I think they're gonna be showing off some new channels and if you want to take a total shot in the dark maybe something akin to the one versus 100 thing getting out some type of some type of entertainment channel how you dig into those channels because I've stopped downloading them because I just don't give a shit about them anymore they're they're kind of pointless I hate to say it the only one I could ever see myself using is that maybe I would use I heart radio if I was hosting a party because there are some decent stations on there with very few commercials some of the HD simulcasts you know that play like dance music or comedy on loop it's kind of like having the satellite radio that's the one that I'm kind of like I could see myself using this but the rest not really I don't know it that whole I don't like the new interface to be honest it's just oh yeah I hate the interface but that doesn't mean I don't like the point of some of the channels and the Netflix channel certainly although actually I I find it better on my ps3 so I used to think now the other we have the technology where we could I don't know select the interface we want thought maybe hmm I'll be nice we have the technology we can select it all right well speaking of rumors there are some rumors about the really good Fleetwood Mac album there are some rumors about the Xbox lube because remember that's what we're calling it now if you don't know why we're calling the new Xbox system the Xbox lube you have to go back and listen to some old episodes but apparently the Xbox lube is supposed to be this sounds really slick it's supposed to be a DVR as well okay that makes it worthwhile this is according to some patents that are floating around out there that apparently on December 27th the US patent office gave Microsoft a patent for a device that would be a game console and a DVR a digital video recorder application running alongside a television client component allows users to record media content on the gaming console the DVR application also integrates itself with the console menu once integrated users can record media content while playing games alternatively users can record content when the gaming console is turned off the recorded content can include television programming gaming experience whether local or online interesting music DVDs and so on when in the recording state users can also switch between various other media modes whether gaming television and so on I would rather I think this would be more something that would be integrated into a television set or integrated into a Cosep top box that would be from a cable provider here's my other thing I mean although I could certainly see this being feasible for the next system why does it have to be the next system isn't it feasible they could release a 360 that has a DVR built in they could do that but I mean I think that by saying it's in their next thing that makes it a selling point true true I mean it is the kind of the big a big thing but I that's the type of thing really how well did HD player hypothetically let's say it was in the 360 that I could see coming out of CES but here's I think dark soccer it's gonna be the next it's never I'm telling you it's never gonna happen on its own it's gonna be something from a cable provider because why are they the cable providers are hey we're providing content to you and you're gonna offer a DVR so now we can't charge people that fee the cost to rent the DVR system out you know and and they don't have to buy our you know our higher tier programs to get a you know DVR you're gonna pull this shit on us fuck that we want some of that money so that's not gonna happen they're gonna put that shit out themselves and it's gonna be kind of like hey you can get Comcast and you get a game player as well you know a Comcast box and you get games and you can do all this stuff or it's gonna be integrated into a TV you know something like that because I'm telling you they're not gonna I mean I I would love it it'd be great you know if we could have a DVR because then I can DVR shit without having to pay my cable writer to do it but I just don't see that happening it's kind of a pipe dream I mean there's Divix or not Divix there's TiVo but you know who fuck uses TiVo anymore yeah you got some support in chat room Loki a lot of folks agree with you Derek H says Loki is correct I think he's saying it about this I don't know because of the delay there's like a minute delay but Rama in the chat says the console is a DVR will cause a problem because cable providers will not support it you're right there are cable providers in agreement with Xbox Comcast our local one is supposed to come on board in early 2012 because if you think about that will be shown at CES for sure like if I can if I can DVR like whatever I can DVR X show or whatever you know it can do like let's just say I can set it up like a TV you know like I can set it up okay I want to record season of this why would I buy the content off of their service I mean because I already DVR did I mean they're losing sales that way they're not gonna do that I mean come on they're gonna lock that shit out and so it's gonna either come from them or it's gonna cost something to you know do that yeah I'm I could see where it's gonna cost Microsoft points to DVR stuff you know it well and I wouldn't say it's necessarily in costume to do so maybe you need a membership or something I don't even know if you need members it's got to come from the cable provider it's it's seriously that's something that would be like okay because now they have these partnerships with these cable companies and stuff where you can do all this on the man crap it's got to be something that's coming from them like a new set top box what if it just worked with over-the-air TV though I mean remember you can hook an antenna to your TV and these magical channels and it works fantastic I can tune in zero channel it depends on where you live in your connection it's it's terrible I need like a big old retro in order well no they don't look like that anymore now they're like square they're I mean seriously I I tried to hooking one up to I was like yeah I'm gonna put this up I'm gonna get on my HDTV for free it worked like crap I got nothing not even a Spanish channel that came in correctly although when I was programming it actually got worse every time I tried to find stations all right listen I actually have to say to be perfectly honest I have no use for DVR I don't watch TV Dan doesn't watch TV everything that we watch is streamed I was to say BBC America maybe I Supernatural on CW I download my shows on the internet because I hate commercials mm-hmm and besides that you know the commercials are what provide your free television I don't watch the TV I mean Dan the only shows that he watches is like Sons of Anarchy and Top Gear and guess what he streams them from other places we were I mean we're paying for cable we rarely use we'd actually downgraded our TV cable and upgraded our internet cable see I'm thinking about it but then then that'll be when the next season of RuPaul's Drag Race starts it's like I gotta have logo I can't wait till the next day gotta have it you could well I cannot sashay away my cable is that by the time it airs at its normal time someone's already uploaded it from an eat from the East Coast showing I got friends that'll spoil Drag Race so then five minutes of it airing on my Facebook anyhow all right I'll just let's move on with some more news Dark Sakura I'm not a hipster I'm just hip anyway so media molecule is spending a lot of money and it's on new stuff they're actually trying to innovate wait it's not LittleBigPlanet 3 they basically they're trying not to rely on LittleBigPlanet as their primary you know safety net if if you will they are trying to actually expand into different audiences so they've been spending about and this is from a British news source they're spending about three point forty four million pounds well that's how much profit that they made in 2011 but they're spending four point one million on research and development so they're keep trying to put their resources into new kinds of games to keep innovating so that they don't have to just rely on LittleBigPlanet to keep them around because I mean I think it's really smart too because you know say that you've got a company that's good for just one thing and that's all they've been doing but after a while the franchise is stale because I honestly think LittleBigPlanet before too long is gonna hit that place where people are gonna expect the same thing and there's not gonna be able to pay but for them to put much new into it I think a big problem is it's it's more I mean LittleBigPlanet is really a limitless game there's so much you can do with it but I think it's the saturation that's gonna be an issue and that's not really on media molecule but it's like you know you have your PSP version and your Vita version and you're you know it's it's coming out on everything well here's a quote on here they say that their investments are going into and this is the quote leading edge physics and dynamics rapid world creation from laser data innovative routes to marketing no to market via web-based interfaces 3d stereo optics for advanced simulation and use of high def data capture and processing techniques hmm so it looks like just from what I can seeing on here they're trying to branch out but try to work on stuff it sounds like they're really working on immersion they're making the holodeck basically they are making a holiday at clay station holodeck they're trying to make it where I think it's not just they're extending to immerse but they're actually trying to draw in your feedback into the game to make it customizable into whatever they're working on Derek H in our chat room at chat dot orange laundry calm says 1.5 million to find new games come on that's just another way to write hookers and blow I don't think so perhaps you know that's just kind of I would buy a game hookers and blow which especially if it's that whole 3d immersive experience like you know you see her nose that's about to snort the cocaine just jumping right out of the TV I want man horse then you need to play Saints for the third all right somebody would lend it to me alright I could play it I just lazy let's move on and travel the world with some release dates and Loki start us off with the u.s. although I don't like last week there was literally nothing so I don't know if this week's the same thing but uh yeah there's pretty much nothing um this week there is well not much I believe my pet puppy 3d from five five games I want to say that I got laid I can't honestly well here I will get you the definitive list here okay but yeah I seriously it was like nothing I think was actually this week we had like three releases of some UMD games hmm there were from well that was actually like this week but um let's see coming out this week ah yes there is pretty much nothing so let's start off with four and one action pack from South Beach games it's four games that were featured on the PlayStation Network and they're all terrible including mushroom wars digger wave wave was it a smash cars and wakeboarding HD all for 20 bucks so I mean that's pretty good right national geographic challenge for PlayStation 3 as well this week and that is it those are the two games you can expect this week except I bet you anything foreign one action-packed doesn't come out this week so maybe one game that's all you get and they're all terrible uh yeah well I mean I don't know if they're absolutely I'm looking forward to mushroom wars because they're for five bucks I mean for five bucks a game I mean that's not bad I mean I would think this is no one's looking for this game in the series so instead of being diarrhea it's just solid poop stop all right let's move to the Japanese release dates it's a there's at least a couple things this week in Japan on the PlayStation 3 there's a game called time leap coming out I'm not sure what time leap is of course I want to think time crisis but it's actually time leap is a romance dating game yeah I've played one of those really animates the characters in real time I don't know what the hell is going on but it was easy achievement points really well timely how did you play it if it hasn't come out yet it has come out there's a version of it has come out okay well it's coming on the Xbox 360 that could maybe that's a price reduction it might be it might be oh I'm sorry it's on the PlayStation 3 not it's a port all right going to the PSP super robot Tyson og saga comes out this week that's really it more robot wars you know what do you know which one was actually cool was the one that had the Ava's in it and you know when I hear og saga I'm thinking like you know some old-school rappers 50 cent games are huge in Japan don't figure dog in a fucking mech that'd be awesome all right Nintendo 3ds get ace combat 3d cross rumble I know there's some ace combat the adventures of tin tin the game gets its Japanese release this week yeah and I I think that's it nothing on the old school DS or anything else so a slow week in Japan yay how about the UK we have some stuff on the 10th Gotham City imposters on the 11th we have Amy that game was delayed I it was like delayed at the last minute so it might not show on the calendar you're using but Gotham City imposters was delayed to February like I remember reading a story doesn't look like poop it just looks like it looks like not fortress to what she got on here last week and talked about how horrible it looks okay um on the 11th is Amy for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and chop lifter HD for Xbox 360 PC PlayStation 3 shop lifter HD so awesome it has a Duke Nukem cameo nice everyone cares about Duke Nukem nowadays on January 13th is crushed on the 3ds or maybe crush 3d it's crushed but they 3d in their house you can go so it's it's crushed through the crush the I mean it's crushed it did it crush three days crushed I don't care done our release dates have been crushed all right just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week you know we kind of sounded like what was that anime club thing I didn't even watch that I watched it because of John and I was like you know what was said is that I know people like that all right low key so there's been some or there's gonna be some changes coming to Xbox Live indie games this includes that they've now allowed people to you know increase the file size of games from 150 megabytes to a new maximum of 500 megabytes and also they've removed I guess the restriction that all games exceeding 50 megabytes in size were required to be priced at either $3 or $5 making them hard to position I guess against Xbox Live arcade games but now the minimum price has been reduced to $1 or 80 Microsoft points all across the board so now you can see a lot more $1 games which is awesome and then of course they've also raised the number of caps of titles that any developer is allowed to host on Xbox Live indie games originally it was 10 now they can have a total of 20 games at a time so neat I guess of course none of the changes that they made have made it easier to find Xbox Live indie games on the actual service so that's too bad we'll be posting lots of direct links when bungee ferret tossing comes out which now with the expanded space I'm expecting Aaron to include video clips of ferrets and clips from our show and I'm just kidding he can do whatever seriously you need to get some of that ferret b-roll you need to be able to put in the Konami code and just get get actual videos of ferrets would be great ferret b-roll and it plays the Benny Hill theme oh wait that would be copyright stuff maybe there's like maybe there's like one of those really bad music free free things that sounds like the Benny Hill theme but it's not yeah it's something alright I was suggesting from the kitchen that it be played backwards alright one other story for you guys before the classic game of the week we were talking about the Vita a minute ago and oh you know the old saying on this show hackers gonna hack so how long did it take the did Sony ever claimed that the Vita was unhackable was that claim ever made I don't think they did this time no I think they just assumed yeah well it's been done the Vita's already been hacked and the first thing that's been running on it Genesis games yay Linux not a bad idea Sonic and knuckle why are you cheering not Linux because I'm kind of getting I see the quintessential thing is to install Linux yes when you when you hack the system you put Linux on it write your hello world program I'm sure I'm sure someone did that but this is something that people will want to download and use a lot of as the Genesis games on the PlayStation Vita Sonic and knuckles now apparently running on the PlayStation Vita it's been out less than a month apparently it's a homebrew Genesis emulator that was originally built for the PSP it's running on the Vita's PSP emulator yes that's right it's an emulator emulating an emulator emulating a Sega blast process and I've gone cross-eyed so there you go Sony apparently has put in some security that is going to meet that exploit moot as soon as it is made available according to the video's uploader but how long is that gonna last watch the PSP they patch new exploit they patch new exploit watch the Wii they patch new exploit they patch new exploit and then they just forget the patch and the cycle continues at some point they just say fuck it all right remember back in the day when you didn't hack your no because you were playing a Genesis if I hacked it I used an axe remember when you actually were playing Sonic enough Sonic and knuckles on an actual Genesis what like two weeks ago so so do we here at orange lounge radio we like to revisit the classic games in a segment we call the classic game of the week every week dark soccer dives into the vault and now she brings a little piece of it over because it's not down the hall anymore yeah so she brings a little piece of the vault with her in a segment we call the classic game of the week dark soccer what should the kiddies be playing this week in America it was known as Rastan in Japan and England it was called Rastan saga ooh it was put up by Taito and he played a barbarian beaten shit up let's have some of that music Rob roll that beautiful bean footage I've been hearing this game music play endlessly because Dan has decided he's on a Rastan kick and has been watching video playthroughs of Rastan we turn down the audio there so we can hear you yeah so much Rastan anyway so it's sort of inspired by Greek mythology so you've got monsters coming out and you have to beat them up with your sword or an axe or hammers some of the weapons are also jewels and you get shields and mantles you also can get a goat's head I think it gives you a one-up or something was it an advertisement for God of War maybe like seeing into the future um anyway as far as the background got graphics for the arcade version you actually had sunlight effects and it was fairly innovative for its time like look at the background on that video for a minute mm-hmm make sure that you send a link of that Toronto for our tumbler okay oh I forgot Rama was queen of the tumbler now yes congratulations on your promotion I have a hard time hitting the tumbler on my little dinky notebook listeners get Jamie laptop I'm getting no no no you can use that guy that rock over there that Alan was using that's okay I want anyone anyway um with the Japanese version actually did get a full dedicated cabinet but the North American and European ones never did there's rakit conversions so you could convert an existing cabinet to whatever the kit was you had any buttons joysticks decals marquees blah blah blah blah blah also the opening to the story as what's on this particular version it was not included in any versions but the Japanese version so here is sort of in a nutshell I'm just gonna read from the article here the game explains that he would be given all the treasures of an empire in exchange for a terrible dragon's head and when you beat a stage or the rounds as they're called you actually get a victory screen that goes with the storyline in the American version there's just sort of the generic story you were a warrior you cleared this crap hooray for you here's some money and some bitches it kind of the opening scene I have to say makes me think of Conan you know the end of the movie when he's sitting on his throne but that is another story he also just looks like Conan yeah I mean you know this was the 80s the whole barbarian thing was totally rocking on you know and I believe that this came out in I want to say 87 don't quote me yet as far as the ports that came out there were there's a Sega Master System version which I've got they actually had decent music believe it or not the master system had pretty decent music there's an MSX version a game give version in 91 oh for the record the Master System and MSX versions came out in 88 there was a PC one in 1990 Commodore 64 version in 1987 a spectrum version 87 CPC version in 88 an Apple to GS in 1990 and the Commodore 64 version the game was impossible to finish Rob what how did they manage that had a bug in the game yikes the bug would prevent a player for making a particular jump from one platform to the other he would always fall short I could never make it across I don't remember that I mean I didn't play this game on 64 but that's that's uh that's got to be irritating to say least well for anyone who wants to play it now there is it was included in title legends with ps2 and Xbox and PC in 2006 which funny enough is how I played this game I do have title legends so didn't you get it for free no what it no that was the year that you bought it when the title thing was going on it yeah I know that was the gaming if you're thinking classic gaming Expo was the Midway arcade treasures that was it because I batted my eyes and I flirted with a Midway lady yeah okay so anyway who was very nice I'm very sad to see the Midways no more well there were two sequels there was a game called Rastan saga 2 that came out as nastar in Europe and nastar warrior in North America and then warrior blade Rastan saga episode 3 there was a 3d fighting game that was put out by Titus software for ps2 and Nintendo Gamecube that was called barbarian in the u.s. the game was licensed by Taito and called warrior blade Rastan versus barbarian when it came out in Japan it also did come out in Europe later it didn't really have Rastan in it though it wasn't really related to the universe it was just oh we could put Rastan on this and it will sell and he also made the character Rastan made an appearance in a title game called champion wrestler as miracle Rastan and now this game it came into some censorship issues that while it wasn't really that adult content it had blood splattered effects when you uh you know beat things yes red pixels yeah they're right and in the Sega Master System support it actually had some boobage in it the Gorgon and harpies were very booby and pubey and the Medusa itself is actually just is all boobies so but I mean that was before we had the ESRB so probably today it might have had an M rating how about that but no we got boobs in the 80s and that's it all right there's your classic game of the week Rastan not to be confused with Rygar which is it's especially the arcade was somewhat of a similar looking game I mean the NES version was way different but indeed not the same game Rastan and now that we're coming up to our break Rob you know what I think it's time for what Polish chocolate cake I brought a chocolate babka awesome it's Jewish eat it all right I'll have a little bit it sounds delish all right so while we feast on cake we're gonna take a break here but don't go anywhere there's plenty more of orange launch ready to come lots more news still in part B your emails your

that stuff with you guys in our chat room at chat orange laundry calm a lot of folks asking what we were playing live during the break now the podcast listeners don't really hear this they just hear that ten seconds a little musical interlude we do usually take a break of about six minutes or so we're actually live taping you know to to run to the restroom or in this case get cake the dark soccer brought or what have you and we played some music from OC remix during the break I don't usually talk about this on the podcast but I had so many live people asking what those songs were and the fact that you can go to OC remix and just download these for yourselves I'll go ahead and tell you what it was that first song was will rock was the artist from Mega Man 3 it was called magnetic fireworks and the second song we played there was a remix from the goonies to password music screen believe it or not but I like that mix a lot that was TJ neko with two K's any any EK KO with I'm taking it all back was the name of that so those are the two songs from OC remix we played so if you want podcast listeners what you could do is is you stop right when you hear the music interlude go listen to those two songs then come back and it's it's like you were listening live but you know obviously for copyright reasons and so forth even though those songs are free to download on OC remix it just isn't right for us to put them into our own darn show we're gonna be getting into some rapid-fire news here in a minute but first I thought I would talk Disneyland because you know I went to Disneyland this week I didn't miss any shows because of it because we went in the middle of the week I've had like 18 days off of work it's been the best thing ever I sat on your cat yes so dark soccer was cat sitting which of course we're incredibly thankful for and we well we took some pictures we took some pictures they actually had the Tron bike out at electronica so I was able to get that and electronica was open during the week go figure I don't think it will be moving for it was it was the most crowded I have ever seen if I get to go to the bonus day thing oh the February 29th thing yeah I don't know that's Disneyland not California ventures I don't know if they're gonna do it I think it's just weekends and yeah they're they're definitely replacing electronica come a spring but you were looking at the pictures and dark soccer was commenting that she really enjoyed the picture of Alan and I with Duffy because Duffy's your favorite Disney character why is Duffy your favorite Disney character it's fucking cute for those who don't know who Duffy is who is done Dan calls Duffy a focus market bear he's like okay he was created at Hong Kong at Hong Kong Disney um okay I was chewing I was in the most of cake so anyway it was made by um Hong Kong at Hong Kong Disney and he really picked up big in Japan as you know we got Jamie a pin and we got her a Duffy sticker nice there you go so but Duffy's just like this cute little bear that many made for Mickey so that he would always have a companion when he went on his travels now you don't have a Duffy bear yet

Disneyland Paris now by the way but I would actually love to go to Disney World it's just it's a little more expensive to go cross-country and you have to go just the right time of year because I don't want to be super crowded but I don't think they have a picture I'm gonna get blown away by the hurricane either and then I'm putting it up on the on the orange challenge picture thingy spazzinator that's not a Duffy beer it's a Duffy bear it's a big difference all right okay the picture is going up on our sorry Loki I know you really want a Duffy bear more than anything maybe next

let's go back to some gaming news so I can eat some cake all right so the game by notch mini craft it's the you know one that he created in 48 hours last year some important to the Android devices and apparently it's not an official port of the game but it's been done by a group called full stad consulting and has touchscreen controls and all that fun stuff and apparently I believe it's free from the Android marketplace so go check it out if you're interested in that this I have no idea why people would buy this but there is a new device called the retro 2 it's a USB device that allows you to play Super NES and Genesis games and emulators the actual thing costs $85 but will allow you to plug in your controllers and what not into it and play it through an emulator or you could probably buy a real console for that price just saying I mean I don't know why you would bother to try to play these through emulators just just last week we were talking about flea markets and like how some of the old systems still were like the Super Nintendo I have over there still works so you know just go get the old console seriously for 85 various spent $85 on something you can you can literally I think you can buy those like portable handheld systems or whatever that play you know Genesis and Super Nintendo games and stuff like that for like less a lot less than that so I mean why would you bother to spend $85 on that I got a text from Dan Duffy the focus group bear so I I just don't know why but if you're interested you can check it out it's retro dot-com I believe yes r-e-t-r-o-d-e if you want to purchase that and then of course a Bobo you may remember him or not from the oh I know I can't remember the goddamn name double dragon yes I was like dragon age dragon to dragon twin drag got wolf something I know it has dragon isn't twin dragons like a plate no that's twin Cobra and that was a helicopter game yes yes so about was big adventure is a free-to-play flash game and of course features one of the characters from double dragon this game reminds me a lot of oh what was the one that they did for there was another one it was I can't remember now maybe it's this game actually them thinking of anyways the game will be coming out on January 11th and I guess it's a firm are confirmed on the official website about was big adventure calm and you can play the game when it comes out and of course it features a bunch of old NES settings and parodies so should be fun all right moving on to some other rapid-fire news you know I love this series kid Icarus of course there's the new uprising game that's coming out mmm what this quarter at some point right do we have a firm date for that yet yeah it's in March I just don't remember what date so at the end of this quarter but in the meantime you can play with some fan remakes there's a fan remake out there called super kid Icarus it's what they're calling a 16-bit remake but that's a little bit deceptive because basically it's a PC version of kid Icarus that uses 16-bit style sprites but very clearly a lot of the fonts and things that are used or PC but whatever you can play it in your emulator and it's basically kid Icarus was souped up graphics and easy mode so if you uh you know kid Icarus is kind of a fucking hard game so if you want to play it a little easier you can do that in this I did play a little bit of it just to I wanted to see if there was more than just the first level in there and yes I got all the way to the second level so there you go so they're playing now before Nintendo pulls it down that's right you want to do that now before they pull it down this is interesting because the website that actually has it is home.com cast net slash tilde super kid Icarus so enjoy it now before it gets pulled because I'm sure Comcast will get that cease and desist from Nintendo any minute now meanwhile speaking of Nintendo a lot of folks very excited about the Zelda 25th anniversary symphony that's going on the symphony of the goddesses this is very similar to Final Fantasy dear friends video games live that whole thing where they're gonna be playing Zelda music live it's gonna be coming hopefully to a town near you at least if you live in the States or certain parts of Canada January 10th is the first show in Dallas Texas March 14th in Vancouver March 26 in Seattle San Francisco on March 28th Denver on April 7th April 20th 21st in Phoenix Atlanta on May 12th Montreal on May 31st Austin on June 22nd Orlando on July 14th and Toronto on September 29th they are saying that there are more tour dates that are planned very interesting what's not on the list so Cal so it's interesting to see maybe they'll do an LA show possibly an LA show like around e3 who knows but yeah they're gonna be playing music from all the different Zelda games so it's not just the new one so if you'd like live symphony I think you'll enjoy that God of War 4 apparently has been spotted on a composer's resume it's the first bit of anything God of War 4 that we've seen was on the resume of Timothy Williams who is the God of War series composer apparently it's on his resume but really is it any fucking surprise to the God of 4 God of War 4 is in the making I didn't think so God of 4 God of 4 I think that's that's what they should actually call it so there you go God of 4 all right Dark Sakura no I will not hold on you're not the boss of me sorry I was I was replying to something in the chat room because our list I will take that Duffy away no no I will smear chocolate on its butt and you'll have a poopy Duffy how do you like the cake by the way the babka it's very good babka chocolaty isn't it like eating a chocolate cinnamon roll yes video game news okay show how about some stuff for Tekken well actually this is specifically new characters leaked for Street Fighter across Tekken and that is shall you and M bison or as he is known overseas Balrog or Vega sorry Vega because they switched them around Balrog is the Vega over here whatever now I've gone cross-eyed so yeah shall Lou and M bison are involved as far as rock band news it's Rob's absolute favorite band ever Hall & Oates I was gonna say Abba has an exclusive thing with a SingStar franchise so it can't be that there's a Hall & Oates pack Oh one which has private eyes I can't go for that and man-eater I would I would get man-eater I kind of privatize is awesome and actually man eaters pretty awesome to it every time I think of Paula notes I think of Patton Oswalt talking about if they had those surgery shows back in the 80s people would want to look like Hall & Oates I'm gonna look like Steve Gutenberg I like what spazz nator suggests in chat here god of guar god of war that would be awesome they should have a guar mod for God of War don't they have guar songs in rock band I got to have something that would be awesome yeah and the last but not least House of the Dead three and four are both coming to PSN but no typing of the dead so therefore failure guess what I have two copies of typing of the dead for like Dreamcast I don't even know where the fuck my Dreamcast keyboard is if I even have I have the Dreamcast version and PC version you need to have typing of the dead day you know what we need to do cuz Mavis Beacon ain't got shit on typing of the dead you know we need to do what we need to get Jessica iguana girl she was really good at that one she and we need to have a typing of the dead a thon because when I got Michael when I got my copy I took it to her apartment the the apartment that she was living in when I met her and we'd play typing of the dead for like three hours I bet I bet I know what apartment that was she lived there for ever several yes yes I remember that one yeah but the one that I stayed up for three days without sleep making a costume with Evan anyway anyway anyway but yeah how's the dead three came out in 2002 and how's the dead four has only been in the arcade so this is an exclusive to PSN nice now how about the Silent Hill game I know different company but that Silent Hill arcade game seriously why haven't we seen this released somewhere for the home because they have a stick up their ass oh okay that answers everything and they're currently stuck on it and the moment that they learn how to stand up without taking the stick up their ass with them we'll probably see it I'm having to hide poor Duffy's version Virgin Disney ears is it too much to ask for some Duffy come over here is too much to ask for some fucking silent hill arcade game and I think that Rob has a potty mouth and he should eat so God this is just like a little Santorum on Horde house this week I'm not even gonna explain it what I'm not even gonna explain it horde house calm little centaur yeah that's I can just imagine it ha at Rick Santorum asshole all right look yeah for the record that was an authentic southern accent I know was it oh I couldn't is that dark soccer is it George Bush I'm not sure moving on Loki maybe you can bring some video game news back into this program that used to be about gaming talk about piracy all right whatever I'll take what I can get so of course a report came out talking about the most pirated games of 2011 this is coming from torrent freak I would think that they would know a little bit about piracy now now Loki Tory isn't it's just a bit torrent news site how dare you well they should still be up to date with you know what's going on including piracy I mean come on I'm not suggesting that they are pirating themselves or facilitating party in any way I am just saying that you know they should know something about it anyways the number one game that has been downloaded 3.9 million times since its release in March of 2011 the crisis to crisis to the game sequel to the game that killed PCs around the world you know but yes crisis to number one game of course modern warfare 3 was downloaded an estimated 3.6 million times since November so you know modern warfare 3 had come out in March and they would probably been number one but oh well don't wait battlefield 3 coming in third with 3.5 million downloads and then of course that ring rounding out the top 5 piva 12 and portal to there you go surprised what's not on the list maybe anything I mean that was all PC stuff let's talk a little bit about how about Xenoblade well I'm surprised more people didn't pirate that to be able to play it in the US now now you spoke too soon the top Wii game downloads on bit torrent in 2011 Super Mario Galaxy 2 Mario sports mix what the fuck are people down the Mario sports mix that's a terrible very good question I get galaxy 2 because that was on a lot of the best list and Xenoblade Chronicles was number 3 Lego Pirates of the Caribbean number 4 and FIFA 12 number 5 weird list yeah Xbox 360 downloads Gears of War 3 number 1 Call of Duty Mario warfare 3 number 2 battlefield 3 number 3 Forza Motorsports 4 number 4 and connect sports season 2 number 5 not that we're advocating piracy but you know it's it happens we'd be naive to sit here and go oh it never happens that's all don't pay no attention behind a curtain it is interesting to see what gets pirated and what doesn't because certain games don't show up on the list at all because of maybe the DRM that's in the game like for example or like a game like SWTOR can't be pirated that much because you have to have an online connection to play so hmm Starcraft 2 big PC game no more on that list I think because of the whole battle net tie-in of course a lot that drives a lot of people bonkers because they don't want to be on the internet to play the game so where's the happy middle ground I don't know all right anyhow moving on to a system that I'm sure nobody's gonna pirate any games on at all the Wii U there's a new rumor about the Wii U because you know rumors about the Wii U or are everywhere and it's a slow news week so why the hell not apparently Wii U will also double as an e-reader this is apparently via a friend who Nintendo approached to do iOS software ports over to the Wii U system which doesn't surprise me at all that you know the Wii U would probably be going after things like Angry Birds cut the rope tiny tower the stuff that's really big on iOS to be able to be played on the you know touch device I wouldn't surprise me at all but apparently Nintendo is also looking at doing digital books magazines comics and so forth on the Wii U and the 3ds apparently instruction manuals could be done this way to strategy guides and Nintendo power you know it'd be really funny hmm but there's no way this is ever gonna happen is if the Wii U controller actually became its own console but it can't I mean because all the processing is done on that I understand that they could put an ARM processor in there and how like its own tablet yeah I'm kind of deja vu-ing what we talked about a little bit last week but yeah we talked about how maybe one of the big things that they're gonna change you know because the system could change a lot but until next t3 is that maybe they're gonna put the its own processor a little or processor in the Wii U controller itself it's gonna drive the price of those things up even more but processors are cheap really yeah I guess it's true it just depends on what they put in there so DDR dollar bill in our chat room says we you trying to be a tablet yeah tablets are terrible well here's the thing though I think a lot of it would be the fact that Nintendo would have a big audience with kids like maybe kids are too young to have their own iPad Rob what how well did the Pico do really but but kids could use the Wii U controller I see that's the thing though is I don't think kids are too young to have an iPad well let me put this way a lot of parents don't think kids are too young to have an iPad and they will buy them an iPad or an iPod or something I mean I remember seeing on some gaming blogs a stupid iPod you know touch freak out you know Christmas videos and stuff like that I mean come on parents are willing to buy their kids that kind of stuff there are cat games on iPad I mean there's there's games for toddlers on the iPad so I'm not surprised that they would do that and I mean seriously with an iPad 3 coming out probably soon I mean it's only gonna drive the prices of the older models down so why wouldn't they you know parents buy an iPad I'm not surprised parents will let their kids play with an iPad because people are letting their frogs and lizards play with their iPad that ant smasher game well people are dumb well as long as the as long as the Wii U gets swap note that's all I care about which by the way if you could smile big cuz I'm gonna take a picture for Bobby here maybe I'm not smiling big maybe I'll send it to Tiger Claw to their little 3d picture there of all our life all right with Duffy adorable hey swap note is actually pretty cool it's like it's it's like it's like Nintendo is finally understanding email well I'm glad they got that bad bank bandwagon if I can only speak now I'm yeah man I'm really looking forward to them understand you know patching games in 2021 or something like that you know maybe with the Wii U that we'll get some actual game patching fantastic Nintendo and for the record I'm putting a picture of Duffy's butt on the olr thing orange launch radio.com all right let's take a moment to visit the mailbag every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer dives into the email bag and read your favorite emails I was gonna say we should start taking emails over swap note but you'd have to have my friend code to do that Duffy should start reading them no Duffy should not read them all right anyhow while I work on my swap note I'm gonna send a swap note to Bobby and I guess I'll send it to Tiger Claw I don't know who else listens to olr on my friends list but I'll send it to them too well I wanted to announce that we do have three winners for the Master System contest wieners wieners that means I have to do I think I've got games enough to divide amongst them as well someone is from will and I will be logging into the email when I get home another one is where is it from Rico and one of them was hit stun so congratulations to our winners Congrats to all you wieners and I'm gonna try to send you ones that you don't already have so and I know who's about getting wet and if you get a duplicate sorry eBay we can autograph them though if you want us to so back to the the mailbag I just played the worst game in history of Nintendo DS I asked for it for Christmas because I love Puss in Boots and a sexy Antonio voice well unfortunately the reviews I were looking at were for the Wii version of the game which apparently is decent this however this abomination should never have been made it is surely the spawn of Satan and all copies should be destroyed seriously the graphics look like something back from early early PlayStation 1 or Nintendo 64 back when their characters look like they were made of Lego blocks no voices and the gameplay tap the screen to the beat no seriously that's the whole stupid game and that's what I get for buying a tie-in game I guess but I really thought the treat puss with some respect sad face Holly D haven't we warned you about tie-ins that's right game tie-ins can be pretty bad but or movie is game times movie tie-ins games can be pretty bad next email bummer though hi olr crew I've never seen the tester on PSN not the first season of the second mostly because I'm over reality shows I also thought the grand prize of being an entry-level tester was kind of stupid though a great way for you to get your foot in the door but I think I'm going to start watching the new season because I just found out a friend of a friend is a contestant we were chatting on Facebook and I asked her if she'd be interested in appearing as a guest on olr but only if you're interested she seemed very interested and I would have to get but would have to get back to me to see if corporate folks would allow her to do so so my question is would you be interested why the hell not sure I want to know who beat dark soccer for the position no dark soccer went through herself right I'm not gonna give any more of her information just because because it's included in the email sure sure but we are interested yeah why not if corporate PSN will let us then we're happy for it I would love to ask some questions about the stuff I want to wait till the show debuts though so we can be like okay how bad did they misrepresent this well maybe there is at least one person it's somewhat internet celebrity that's actually in there oh really yeah the guy does I don't know if you've ever seen them the the awesome games like Metal Gear awesome they're like great he's actually in in the contention there that's funny so rooting for him because he's the only person they recognize vaguely anyway says thanks and keep up the good work and thanks for putting the podcast up on Mondays they're not so blah anymore that's from Stan I had to show up within an hour last week this is great having it at my house good for you just saying okay by the way I sent that I sent that message on spa pass or was it swap note see how long it takes to get to tiger color this is good evening dark Sakura sky and Loki Saurus I am writing to you from a pseudo email account for our conversation you can call me track slur I'm a longtime listener here is my plight I am a 34 year old male gamer living in northwest Florida I play everything from Batman Arkham City on Xbox to swo tour and while on PC I make a decent income from working full-time technical job in the Network Operations Center I'm suffering probably from maybe a newer condition called gamers loneliness or gamers depression I am an okay looking guy average weight and height I have money in a car I'm having problems finding a companion I like women so I'm not alone I've tried POF okay cupid geek to geek with no success I think it might be my age and the single gamer women are ultra rare maybe the fact that I don't drink or go to clubs slash bars I do know my schedule is bad I work Friday to Monday 12-hour shifts with a two-hour commute to work each day but it's my job to deal with this I've been buying tons of games that go into my never-ending backlog and buying lots of gamer where my room looks like a gamers cache now I can have any game I want and have three days off a week I can game but I'm not any happier I even stopped playing DDR in the air I kids because I was tired of playing by myself and I stopped getting any enjoyment in fact I don't feel happy you're doing anything I've been trying to do changes from but the results end up the same I don't want to be something I am NOT just to conform to find someone to be with I wish I could find a companion like you guys I would marry Dark Soccer's clone thank you I don't have a clone Dark Soccer is married however I wanted to let you all know this information because there could be other gamers out there that could be feeling the way I feel I'm not sure if this is just how the world world balances us gamers out of future equations reduce population your loyal listener track slur this message is brought to you by Shermie Skylander Emporium Wow DB mail okay um that threw me for a little bit of a curveball I I think it's one of those things where when you kind of let it go that you kind of have all that hanging over your head like oh my god I need this perfect life and I need this companion and I need I need all this to happen ABC to happen so I can be happy no no no you have to learn to be happy with what you've got and you're kind of like your current situation and then once you kind of have that about you that that confidence the rest of it will come I think I think I always say it happens when you stop trying to force it I mean yeah I also say things happen when you make them happen but that's like stuff that you have tangible control over you know like I I can't do this well then go to school and learn how to do it you know that type of thing in this case you know like with and I know I've told the story million times we Dan and I hooked up is that we had just been friends we weren't trying to do anything and he just called me to cheer me up and we kept talking because it worked and I moved out here and we worked you know that's just that's like a really rare success story on top of that you know it was just sort of a faded thing I guess but like I really think that that a good relationship will find you when you're not looking for one if that makes sense yeah I mean Alan and I were friends online for probably four or five years via live journal just you know and you know I'm sure he thought you know I was attractive I thought he was attractive but it's kind of like yeah he lives in San Francisco it's it's like he lives in China you know so far away and we never really gave it any thought until one day it just kind of let's go out sometime and and we did and then it was kind of like well we're gonna make this work and we did so you know it just it just happened like I never thought it would and it did you know oh there's somewhere in the back of my imagination I imagine Nelly going after Loki with the club isn't that what a girl but you know for real like I I wouldn't like just don't stress about it like that's I you're only gonna cause yourself like hurt to do that and I don't think you need to go out to bars or clubs I think you're doing the right thing just kind of put yourself out there online I would say if you really feel like you need to go out and do something try maybe like I know this sounds really weird but try like joining a club or maybe there's a nonprofit in your area a political cause you can get behind the volunteer you know something where you you force yourself to get out of the house well when I lived in Alabama and keep in mind this is when I was effectively single you know I did a lot of stuff I larped yes I played live-action vampire shut up there's not else to do in Alabama I I was in band I did jazz band I was in orchestra you know because I was still a big band nerd I would do ensembles with other friends I would I played the end oh god that was when I was in eight games a week for a while and I did there was even I gamed every night every night I was in different gaming groups so I mean and I even dated a couple of people that I gamed with like there was one guy who I was really into for a while but we just kind of never sort of fun to make out with and you know fun to make out with good friend you know never that's that's exactly the type of people I met doing Rocky Horror for so many years it's almost the same kind of thing but I mean you know if if you're making yourself into some kind of hermit I mean you're not gonna meet anybody unless you find ways to branch out you have to make it yourself and so okay so clubs aren't your deal you know what I hate clubs too I sometimes go just because I like booze and I like goth music so I'll go hang out but I don't you know go because I'm well then again I didn't really start clubbing until I moved out here at all but if that's not your thing then find you know I I've made friends through my temple for example after I converted and I don't know if you're religious or anything but you know there's always something you can do with like-minded people you know or you know if check out actually check out YMCA because sometimes they offer not just you know the little fitness things that they do but they'll have workshops and classes or you know find something that you're interested in and then put in that topic and your location and see if you can find groups for it but for and coming back to this point is I think this is very important I think the first thing you have to do then we'll stop the advice show I promise but I think the first thing you have to do is you have to really sit down and say I have a good life I mean you do have a job you you I don't you know you right but you know but you you have a lot of stuff that's going for you for you right now you know you have a you know the things that you're proud of and you know I don't know this person so it's hard for me to say you know whatever they are into but there's probably a lot and in the person who says his email you know I'm I consider myself good-looking you have a lot going for you then you know so love yourself yeah find the stuff that makes you happy and focus on that you know if if the games aren't doing it for you anymore then there's another gap mm-hmm distract yourself but I'm not saying distract yourself in a don't work on the problem kind of way but I'm sorry reading chat but I was gonna say you know find new things you know if if your current hobbies not doing it for you find a new hobby but you have to be out there is the thing if you're gonna try to meet somebody you have to be out there and I'll be a hermit Loki won't be your dating advice my advice is hey you're gonna have a lot of hookers sometimes it's actually nice to have a lot of free time to play the games you want to play because you're not gonna have that because once you have a baby that all goes away it's all gone that's good advice that's you know what and that's that's another way to look at it like I'm not saying like you know hate on kids or whatever cuz you know but enjoy the life you have while you have it right yeah so there you go anyway I mean sometimes you know yeah it's just like you know however if you want to incorporate sex life and your video gaming you could try jlist because they have lots of stops honestly I just go to cons that's not a bad idea why not Chris and Megsy did they meet at a con that online oh how funny I went to conventions we went to we had that three-day thing it is it is a social going out meeting other people yes just I've known people who've met for the love of God use protection and you know what my lesbian parents met at a convention oh there you go back in the day all right we got to move on move on this is becoming the dating dating game here orange lounge DDO hi olr less than three makes a return hi olr this past week I've been on a nostalgia trip did you come back I ended up digging up my mega drive and playing castle of illusion and streets of Rage 2 now I'm getting on a list full it's it's I in there so I'd actually side on a completely different subject sing as dark soccer has been raving about the game I just thought I'd point out that fractal is now available in indie royales New Year's bundle and that's an indie royale calm I n di e r o y a le calm also Nintendo seems to be going out of their way to make getting the circle pad add-on as awkward as possible is being released exclusively through savvy and on time online only retailer here in the UK and that looks like a very unhappy face hear you later catastrophic Moggy you know I love castle of illusion and I love streets of Rage 2 so I would say great gaming I've been actually talking about fantasy zone with people and I really need to sit down and hook up the master system in place of fantasy zone um yeah fractal awesome game everyone needs to play it so go get that bundle oh yeah it's in that that yeah there's like a new bundle I was thinking about getting that actually get it okay and then someone sent us a video but I can't watch it on my computer sorry this is a great comment spazzinator making a comment on the last email the dating advice email he needs a cupid arrow to the knee that I as much as I hate I thought was pretty good that's pretty good pretty good congratulations congratulations to our winners for the three of you that emailed me email me your address and you will get a game in the next couple weeks master system game at random however I will make every attempt to send you something you don't already have so all right I texted Dan to remind him he's like don't give away my games I was like I talked about this all right stop being so stingy is that it for emails that's it all right mailbag at orange lounge radio.com if you have an email for us I mean literally we'll read anything I mean we that one email was about dating not even totally about games but whatever and guess what well Duffy Duffy better not send emails to the show hi I'm Duffy all right it's time to get into the F use of the week every week we are angsty why because we can I'm not at all upset anymore because I have Duffy the end Loki if you do Microsoft Excel that constantly try to outsmart it in order to get to do what I wanted to have visual basic yeah but see I don't want to be visual basic that's why music sell all right I don't know I'm actually in a pretty good mood like I should be giving an F you to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow after being off for like two and a half weeks but I'm like seriously this is the longest vacation I've had since I started working there which was ten years ago which didn't involve me being in the hospital or having surgery or having the swine flu which happened once and even that it wouldn't have had the swine flu I'm still sorry about that Rob I was only out for like two weeks not to have so but I actually like I'm so well rested and feel so good I'm like I'm actually this weird looking forward to going back to work so in reality we'll say yes so F you to that all messing with my mind I do you know what though I'm lucky I'm very fortunate I really do enjoy my job it's not I I teach people for a living it's a it's a great thing I love my job I really do and they're not small children it's just sometimes some of the others you know stuff everybody gets annoyed with their job at some point you know because anytime you put a bunch of personalities together and you know one's in charge or whatever you know things might go but I I have a great boss I really do my boss is awesome we work so well together I can't really complain so F you did the fact that I don't take two and a half week vacations more often because I really should and F you did the fact that the only way I was able to do it before was getting the swine flu you know what I'm sorry I need to reward myself more often that's what I I guess that's all right I didn't know I had it I rubbed AIDS all over the bear I'm just kidding let's move on Loki all right so Nintendo being the forefront of digital and online they apparently slapped the wrists of the owner director of icon games entertainment and Richard Hill Whithall he apparently has released several games in the last year on various platforms and he recently shared some sales numbers on the website gamasutra but then was asked by Nintendo to take down the numbers for its platforms according to Richard Nintendo doesn't allow developers to share digital sales numbers for self-published we were in downloadable ds titles that's kind of interesting and apparently I guess it hurts smaller developers who I guess need to make those sales numbers known in order to secure financing and plan out business models and stuff like that yeah apparently though you can still kind of figure out his numbers because he gives a total number and then you know the other platforms and do the math I have to do math and and and on top of that the numbers weren't so good on the Nintendo platforms unfortunately so maybe that's why they don't want numbers out there there's a lot of saturation on the Wii marketplace too and it's really hard for games to stand out because the Wii store isn't set up very well you know yeah all right well we talked a little bit earlier in the show and I know Bobby talked a lot on his show tonight of course Bobby black wolf was on before us at all games radio talked a lot about SOPA and you know the Internet's been talking a lot about SOPA and I'm sure most of you you know listening they're gonna scrub it clean of content most of you guys who are tech savvy enough to download this podcast and listen to it and understand it probably already have a general awareness about SOPA but this is how the message might be communicated to those that don't understand SOPA I find this very interesting apparently they're talking about a huge what they call the nuclear option to protest SOPA and this is rumored to be happening on January 23rd because the Senate is going to debate this on the 24th and what we're talking about is major major websites shutting down essentially for a day you know replaced with a black screen generally talking about how you know how soap is bad and all that stuff we're talking AOL, eBay, Facebook, Etsy, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Zynga game network this out ties into gaming and really I mean this is just just anybody who cares about tech has a vested interest in SOPA and I don't I think I've made this pretty clear as as Loki as a start soccer but olr is obviously against SOPA and based on the reason that it gives companies way too much power I understand that people want to do something about piracy but there has to be I think more accountability in that regard and SOPA is not really gonna do anything for some sites it's if you know the numbers you're gonna be able to get on the pirate bag I just don't understand so I know does it hurt I don't understand that it's almost like to me like a really terrible web filter that's at like someone's office or something like that where it's like oh I can't go to Facebook oh but if I type in the near the IP address I can go to Facebook if that's all they're doing to block this and that's kind of stupid you're not supposed to censor the internet you know what I mean you're not that that's what that's what we read about and go how can China stand that to have the web censored I mean I understand it's just a part of you know that country and all that but you know is that what we want to become here it's just it's it's yucky and I I personally I I I think the Atari story you kicked off the show with illustrates it per perfectly there's gonna be companies that are gonna overreach and the little people aren't gonna be able to fight them and that's wrong that is so not what America is supposed to be about well then again we can also detain people for no good reason well you know that's that's a whole nother Oprah or so they say but yeah but it's I think it's all related it's it's screwed up how much power companies have in this country it really is it's getting this well I don't get political on the show not nearly as often as she does but this is something that really irritates me and especially when you have all these video game companies where the ESA has stood against it you know because no piracy bad so the ESA stands against it but most of the gaming companies like we don't a lot of the gaming companies were reached out to for comment and basically came back with we don't we don't really do politics we just make games so the ESA kind of speaks for us what what educate yourself well that's fine if you don't if you're gonna let someone else but it's for you and it's gonna be those morons the people that don't understand why this is very bad that are gonna ruin it it doesn't really affect them I mean as far as their product goes the fact that they are these big companies that are gonna be able to pull Justin TV feeds and things that might be critical about their game that ought to be legal under fair use when these little reviewers are gonna be able to fight them that is when they don't even fucking understand the law they just know they can do it exactly bothers me exactly why do they care then that's the point it was all you're gonna give us a bunch of power to take down all these people that we don't like sweet why would I oppose that but of course they're not gonna say oh yeah we were strongly for that because then people backlash against them so they got to take you know the on the fence approach or oh we're just hands off we'll let them do whatever you know that way they can't let you know well I think that first sites that can't if people want to add though I think to the sites that are gonna be down on that day but you can't necessarily take down you know your server or anything if you've got a blog or something you know say I've got a couple blogs on blogspot put a big notice no activity on this day you know don't post on Facebook that day don't I mean Facebook's gonna be dumb I'm saying don't blog do it because maintain web silence you know there if you imagine if you can't use Google for a day I mean that's gonna piss some people off I think that's necessary I think it's necessary they should all be they should all go down so now let's see what did I want to say here Oh frisbee in our chat says may I suggest these companies use ocean marketing to speak for them I realize you're making a joke there but think about how did that whole thing really how did that whole thing happen the guy represented himself as something he kind of wasn't right anyway Tiger class as I recall two years ago take to send DMCA notices to several Justin TV channels that were showing GTA 4 when it first came out I believe this is because they didn't want spoilers being leaked spoilers are gonna get out there if not in text forms it's just it's silly anyway if you want to do something about it that's my problem right there though that's not because your your copyrights were violated or because someone's you know posting it as like their own thing it's because oh we don't want spoilers coming out that's not a reason to go and say hey I need these videos taken down I'm sorry but that's like you know review spoiling the end of a book or something like that you can't you can't force them to take it down because you don't like the fact that someone spoiled the book all right so anyhow if you want to do something about SOPA I gotta give props to destructoid to compile this pretty good article that they have on their website they was posted January 7th talking about SOPA and they even have kind of some form letters that you can copy paste although I would kind of encourage you to put your own thing on it I mean a lot of them prior aren't even gonna get read let's be real but send this to put on our tumblr to okay I'll do that send that over to you know I'll get props to destructoid they did and one other thing I like they compiled a list this is very useful a list of all these game companies where you can contact directly emails and websites and I thought that was pretty cool so you know you can take your case to the companies themselves that are supporting this I am do I need to even say like look at what happened to go daddy and that was who that was a bit of a mess and talk about a backpedal there I mean seriously oh actually no we're not a we're against SOPA now yeah right so let me send that over to Rama and you can put that on the tumblr if you want to read more about that orange launch radio tumbler calm alrighty let's move on with some more news getting into some phone calls very soon at 1 877 game olr or a username on skype orange launch radio but not just yet a few more emails dark Sakura you Suzuki who my husband has met I have a photo of Dan with you Suzuki it's very faded now but he said something in an interview with the Toulouse game show so this is in French and I'm going to read it in French if I can remember my pronunciation right no pool no to near a license party the Sega which means we can obtain the license from Sega do you know what they're talking about Shenmue so he's not saying that they are actively going to do it but I think it means that there might be an interest in them trying to obtain it for a YS net which is his company so maybe it'll happen that would be kind of cool if it did don't you think very cool if you want I think he should play a game of lucky hit uh-huh you know all I ever knew that game was play space Harrier anyway so you can the interview is actually up on YouTube if you want to find it it's the you Suzuki interview on Shenmue so all right I would be great I'd love to see that series come back I think a lot of people would I think he wants to finish it true no it's like he's got a story that's like mostly told it's got like one chapter left really and what's it out all right Loki you know I'm actually surprised that this took this long to settle but you remember way back when I'm back before you could use USB drives and you know near Xbox 360 you're limited to their overpriced hard drives and their memory units which you know really didn't have a lot of space on them and they were really expensive and a company day tell came out and you know had this wonderful max memory device you plop a micro SD card into and be able to save your games to that and everything was peachy keen until Microsoft patched the Xbox 360 to block these from being used on the device and of course then there was lawsuits filed and all that fun stuff well they've settled out of court probably because at this point even if that were to be allowed to be used on their you know system no one's using the memory cards anymore because it doesn't work but the consumers who bought these didn't get anything no they got nothing well hooray to these companies for settling but the consumers got screwed didn't they yep what do they get out of it for buying these products that don't work the satisfaction knowing that you know the US justice system has triumph well golly gee willikers Loki now I can sleep at night I'm glad you can all right somebody's celebrating a birthday this week in fact they're turning 30 years old if you can believe it it's the Commodore 64 that's right the Commodore 64 celebrated its 30th birthday this week and all I have to say is man I feel old because I grew up on the Commodore 64 I remember having one of these I think we got it Christmas like 83 but the Commodore 64 actually came out in 1982 I love this the whole machine would hold the equivalent of one one hundredth of an mp3 file $595 is how much these systems cost back in 1982 they say that is now with inflation $1400 today is how much these things cost it was first introduced at the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and yeah boy Commodore 64 now 30 years old and man I love my Commodore 64 so many good games and those sit chips man so much chiptune stuff the year today is just directly influenced by the Commodore 64 I wish I still had a working one of these I had a Commodore 64 C we actually broke our original Commodore 64 and we got a 64 C the white one and that was a pretty awesome machine I was five did you have when it came out no I told you I didn't have a Commodore 64 I had a click Oh Adam with the cassette deck by the way on a related note would you like to feel old for a minute here are some other games that are turning not systems but games that are turning 30 years old this year in 2012 you're ready these games came out in 1982 making them 30 years old bag man bump and jump burger time on my favorites dig dug dig dug Donkey Kong jr. gravatar joust by the way this list is from arcade heroes.com upset with you joust for influencing that horrible part of Wow jungle hunt or jungle King depending on where you live kangaroo I freaking love kangaroo I played this 30 years old but the crap out of that at godfather's pizza when I was little liberator that's the one that's the first one I don't really recognize that was an Atari game millipede moon patrol Oh God I used to love moon patrol we have this a local arcade mr. dew I love mr. dew pango you love pango fucking love pango that's a great game that's the little penguins you know they had one at Pasquale ace and it finally broke Oh pole position love pole position Popeye remember that and they did a game out of it because Nintendo made it a reactor robotron 2084 they had a version of that on Xbox Live that was one of the first arcade games that came out on Xbox Live Q Burt that's another game I played the crap out of them I know the swearing guy with a long nose everybody thought this had an awesome name Satan's Hollow it's actually kind of a derpy game but you know it was a it was the Midway it's on the arcade treasures for Midway and all that and it's kind of kind of see in collections but it runs on that same hardware as like journey and timber and some of those old classic Midway games sin a star beware I live space duel Star Trek the Sega one time pilot tutankham Tron is 30 years old and Zaxxon by saying 30 years that's what I need to do for classic game mm-hmm so there you go now we can all feel old together just think in 30 years when we're sitting here on our show celebrating the 40th anniversary going hey remember you remember the Xbox 360 fucking bastard stole all my money fucking thing broke after only having it a week I had to send it in but damn there was some good games all right hopefully by then we're all playing the holodeck though because remember gaming is just inching forward slowly to the holodeck all right one eight seven seven game olr or our username on Skype Skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call right now and talk to us meanwhile let's do some tweets we will start with a tweet from ramaditya night says sonic and knuckles I remember back in the day I used the cheat that allowed me to change sonic to whatever item I want and cross the wall I found a lot of bugs like a place you were not supposed to be able to go there spikes all around I wonder if that was so is that like a code in the game or is that something like a game genie remember the game genie where you could like hacks or the game I'm sure that is something that Loki had to own the game genie oh yeah well he's talking about on the game gene he was talking about sonic and knuckles and some of the things you could do with that yeah I used to actually sit down all night with my game genie and my SNES mm-hmm and just try to figure out what different codes by altering other codes hmm and I found a few ones like ones that turn Mario green that was it all it did was turn Mario green that's all it does yeah makes Mario Luigi but not really it turned his skin green all right let's go to the phones cuz we're getting some calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's up guys you know hey guys you know what's on your mind buddy not much I just want to talk about this sober thing I think a lot of us over reacting first off I don't think it's gonna go through and if it did go through I don't think it's gonna be that big of a deal I think that a lot of people are getting worked up and they're freaking out all over nothing I think pretty much what uh what these companies want to do you know the game companies movies music whatever they they just want to make money so pretty much this law going out is just gonna be a way for them to protect their content and be able to put it on their sites and make their type of money that they want to make I don't think they're necessarily trying to shut down the internet or stop us from talking on Facebook or any of that kind of stuff well I it's it's a fair viewpoint and I understand that but but could it happen to one person I mean I like again I have to refer to the Atari thing at the beginning of the show that they're pulling down all these games that they may or may not have the ability to do and I worry that legal departments of companies who don't really understand things might go a little batshit crazy and the problem is if you leave the door or what's the expression you give them an inch and they take a yard I I worry about putting that much power into a corporation's hand because people you and me can't fight it yeah true that is I can see a point there I'm not clearly I understand why they want to do something about piracy I get it but can you ever really stop piracy I'm not sure there's no way they can stop it this is I mean I mean I don't mean to cut you off but I mean if you if you look at the record like as far as piracy goes like when it comes to um movies and video games a lot of the stuff that's like highly pirated or also the stuff that sells the most you know I think music is the only place that actually has a they should really do something about piracy because I mean you don't have to mod anything on your system to be able to play the illegal download of music that you download right so I think the music industry is the one that's taking the real heat from it but not necessarily the games and the movie industry right you know and I again I understand they want to do something but I just think this is going to do more harm than good because what's it really gonna fix that the IP for the pirate Bay will be out there within within minutes of this thing passing and everybody will have it and there'll be add-ons for Google Chrome and Firefox it will lie there already are there already are so I mean I just it's not gonna do any good so I buy but I understand why they want to do something but I think at the end of the day it's gonna be accountability you want to prove that someone stole money from a bank they got to go to court have a trial it's kind of what's got to happen in this case you know yeah they just they just need to understand the internet more like they're still trying to treat the internet like if it's the the real world where it's not doesn't necessarily work like that you know so I think that they need to seriously look this over they come up with you know with the better law the better soap or whatever else you want to call it but um I'm not really that worried about it well I don't know I I I hope you're right but I I do worry about leaving that opportunity there but you're a little more optimistic than I so I I applaud you for that so I hope you're right optimistic to a fault all right anything else you want to share listeners you guys have a good night all right you too buddy take care of tonight bye all right you know what it's it's cool that he has a differing opinion and you know I again I I hope I think he said it best at the end there maybe he's optimistic to a fault but you know we'll see we'll see actions speak louder than words so we'll see but I just have a feeling the first time a website gets shut down incorrectly it's gonna just all hell's gonna break loose all right one eight seven seven game all our username on Skype is orange lounge radio meanwhile we have some more tweets tiger claw on Twitter sends us a tweet one of them is already about that media molecule thing you already talked about earlier but the other one is about PlayStation 3 video editing app play memory studio apparently leaked ahead of CES this might be something that they're Sony's gonna show at CES and we'll get to that in a minute but we're gonna take another call while the skype lines lighting up higher on orange launch radio who's this hey guys do you know DDR dollar bill what's on your mind buddy first of all I wish you guys happy new year we're getting some feedback back on your speakers buddy back away from your speakers if you can we're getting bad feedback happy new year to you how's this now I'm still hearing it but it's not it's not killing me get out your question or comment fast we'll try to make this quick call oh okay which is a quick story a while back I don't know if I posted by look I said that I stopped playing Wow because I got sick of all the jackasses kept bitching about everything I kept doing in the game can you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you yeah people are people are assholes on the internet unfortunately yeah so for once a long time I pretty much just quit like whole mmorpgs then I try try a couple other free ones out there and then I tried out DC Universe when it came out for free uh-huh to the point of loving it so much I actually brought the down I should about DLC sports so you're saying the community in DC Universe online maybe not so bad um consider that one time I played 130 more and Ruth making to me we're making jokes about um let's see 16 year olds and an all women's squad and everybody's dueling in the middle of nowhere it was a lot more fun you know sometimes it's just about finding the right fit for you and although you know unfortunately a couple jackasses probably ruined Wow for you and I would argue there's other people in there maybe it just wasn't a fit for you after all maybe DC Universe is just you know kind of better I don't think you have to play one MMO just because it's the popular one you like what you like there's people out there that fucking play Hello Kitty island adventure and they fucking love it so you know what let them have their thing yeah but it goes back to well for one last thing cuz I'm not gonna keep it short okay after when I got to my finally hit level 30 and DC Universe the final level I found out that I actually have to group and it made me realize that maybe it's okay to group with people once in a while just gotta find the right group so I went back on Wow I quit this one guild I was with and I joined up with another guild and was a whole different experience well I have to perfect story I got I got to hang up on you to your dollar bill though cuz like the chair I'm saying it sounds like you're living in a hunt bees nest but thank you so much buddy have a good one yeah well here's what I was gonna tell you and just message me in the chat room um is when I started playing well when I finally liked it again I did not play with other people at all all I did was chat with the guild and quest by myself and yeah and I've done two characters that way I did Rebecca black and Iressa both that way but now I've actually got a character that I am doing nothing but instances with and and maybe you know seasonal quests and little things but the point is is that I'm actually trying to group with other people and I found that actually not every group is full of idiots a lot of them are many of them don't have proper grammar and they're very hard to understand but for the most part it's it's partly your support your support group outside of your pugs you know and people people sometimes just are kind of weird online like I admit like okay I play with my friend Matt who is grandpa Warcraft on Horde house if you ever listen to him and when we group together he does the weirdest shit in instances like he's a friend of mine and I love them but oh my god like we'll start an instant so like we roll in instance together and it's the two of us and three random people and as soon as the instant starts he'll go like he'll say in party chat he'll say something like sassy I'm really sorry to hear about your abortion this afternoon are you feeling okay you know you gotta understand a lot of these people are just doing it to get their rocks off you know they mean that night oh yeah you know yeah yeah yeah well he's been on this oh he and me and John were running an instance and decided to completely troll the people that we were with and Mary uh-huh decided to completely troll our fifth person yeah and we had a poor person doesn't know that you're just fucking with them you know we finally had one person hang out with us now keep in mind and and people who play well will know it is it was in halls of origination huh we got to the last we did all of the bosses all of them all of them in halls of origination we finally get to the last guy and we get a person who's just really cool and playing along with us we're like that's what we wanted we wanted the person who will play with us someone who will rag on people with you okay I got it I gotta go to the call we picked up another call hi you're on horse entree who's this hey this is SSJ 100 Matt hey SSJ 100 Matt haven't talked to you in a while how you doing I'm doing good I'm

night but if you didn't get through tonight and you have something you really want to say be sure to send us a tweet at twitter.com slash olr or you can email us mailbag at orange laundry calm speaking of tweets I wanted to finish Tiger Claws thought here apparently this is coming from a leak at the Sony booth at CES is showing on the PlayStation 3 something called play memory studio which will be excuse me well we're seeing it happen on radio a video editing suite for the PlayStation 3 apparently you can put effects in video and kind of do some editing live on the PlayStation 3 that's kind of cool I guess I already thought the PlayStation did kind of allow some limited video stuff but that's cool if they're enhancing it especially if it's free I wonder if it'll be free I somehow doubt it Tom and one on Twitter sent us this and I saw this earlier this week cuz somebody posted some Facebook it's fucking hilarious it's a macho man dragon mod in Skyrim Loki have you seen this oh yeah yeah it's great this is the beginning again did you have that I said next prisoner to the block prisoner nice and easy this is actually being rendered from the game it's not like a fan-edited thing with the mod of course it is a thing pure terror I got it the giant much yeah the dragons wearing a macho man hat that's great with the beard and everything I'm making Alan installed as one it's really free I fucking love that that's amazing you wanna know something Rob I need that on the tumbler that song here's your stories from Jamie's childhood mmm disco inferno which keep in mind I had two copies of this of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack on vinyl used to stand on my bed dancing in my pajamas to disco inferno okay I gave that to Rama for the Twitter cuz that that video is just too damn good if you haven't seen yet I also posted the link in chat so there you go enjoy guys it's the one that says tico because I got it from Twitter cuz Tom and linked that so there you go all right and lastly a couple tweets here from Zen monkey 69 tweets us hey 69 tweets us saying it's 2012 and we have a shitload of video game sequels coming what games do you think don't deserve a sequel and should just die what games don't deserve a sequel and should just die how about the Imagine series imagine babies there was one last year for the 3ds that was it one I think Holly would say the puss in boots game the puss in puts puss in boots series absolutely puss in puts tiki a tight tiki I hope I'm saying that right and chat says Elder Scrolls just throwing it down saying there's too damn many Elder Scrolls games I'm gonna go on next year is pretty fun yeah you won't have another Elder Scrolls game 2012 that's you'll have expansions for Skyrim that's for sure yeah for sure I franchises that need to die oh god I like part of you wants to be cynical and say the Just Dance series but parties they can be kind of fun so I can't really think of anything because honestly if I don't want to play them I just don't know that they exist that's kind of where I'm at is like I don't think a lot about the games that I don't want to play you know I could be super cynical go Call of Duty because I don't play those games but I realize other people do play those games I'm kind of looking over at my own collection how about Tetris remakes yeah that's another one I'm getting sick last dress was kind of fun but that's back in the super scope days apparently that 3ds one's pretty good but it's still the same fucking game we've been playing forever it might be time for the need for speed series to die maybe that would be another answer I would have well or at least of all that or something I don't know I can't yeah I really can't think of anything offhand I wonder what our chatters think it chat maybe Saints Row car her her no no yuki says cooking mama that's actually a really good answer yeah just the mama series in general it it's not doing well I that's a very good answer I can stand with yuki on that one yuki also says sonic games no because generations yeah I need this game but then I need sonic generation there's admittedly there's been a lot of crap yeah and I don't I think that sonic 4 was kind of a I will give you one that's just and it is a somewhat major game coming out this year okay Silent Hill I think I kind of agree non konami Japan produced Silent Hill games specifically me today yes to go back in house to Konami Japan I agree Silent Hill is kind of done and karaoke revolution American or karaoke revolution glee needs oh there you go winner everything how about everything to die but glee needs to get canceled all right last another tweet from Zen since I haven't read tweets from Zen before I will read two tweets tonight Zen says if PlayStation 4 Xbox lube and the Nintendo Wii U were all coming out on the same day and you could only get one which system would you get too early I how can you answer that because we don't we don't know what the Xbox lube and the PlayStation 4 have to offer and we only know about half of what that we use really bring into the table so you'd be asking me to base that decision based off of the current consoles and the problem with that is the jump we made from the last realm of consoles right because when the systems first came out I would say the Xbox 360 was in a better position than the PlayStation 3 was when they first came out but yet if I had based my choice completely off that generation before this one the PlayStation 2 I think was better than original Xbox you know so it's just it's it's it's way too early to call I in here here's also the realistic in me is like well I'm going to end up with them all anyway because I have the sick addiction of video games and do this show and everything so it's kind of like I'm going to try to show some restraint at least maybe not buying one of the consoles if not to the console luck you know what though honestly with you would have played on the Wii and stuff I think it's gonna be pretty easy for the Wii U I think I say that now I guess I will humor the question and I'm going to say PlayStation 4 and the reason why I because I just have the feeling out of the three systems it's going to be the most advanced because I think it's going to be the one that's in the incubator the longest meaning I think it'll be the last of the three to come out so I think it's going to have the best processor in it and all that but again that doesn't necessarily make it the best but I literally have nothing else to go off of right now you know so that I'm going to say PlayStation 4 just to humor the question but that could change absolutely so alright that's it for the Twitter's tonight at twitter.com slash olr oh actually I see one oh never mind that's somebody new following us thank you on Twitter it's Twitter combines the followers and the app messages now it's really weird all right anyway um last minute stories Loki dark soccer anything for last minute stories um no Loki um my story is that I had trouble finding a cage man sock thankfully I downloaded one a while ago so that'd be fine and not my preference I they've had some better songs but I'm gonna put it in anyways all right that's gonna do it them for another episode of orange lounge radio hey thank you guys so much for downloading your show and checking us out you know going sorry this rude it's a step wave way way back to the beginning of the show here and we're talking about best best games of 2011 mm-hmm it's not really a game but I have to recommend ready player one seriously if you haven't read it yet you need to read it because it's awesome and I mean if you're a fan of games especially a fan of classic games you're gonna love this excuse me and I need them to actually sign my book that'd be pretty awesome if he's gonna hit a con or something well I'm getting coffin fit again I got to say this I think I'm allowed to say this because it's it's out there post on the internet but apparently in Sacramento there's gonna be a group that is going to do a live shadow casting a la Rocky Horror of Scott Pilgrim versus the world I want pretty awesome and I can't wait I mean as much as I have kind of a love hate with that movie there are things I loved about things I didn't like about it I think that's gonna be awesome because you know that theater is gonna be full of nerds that are into it you know and I think it's gonna be a great showing I want to I definitely I'm gonna see cuz I know the guys that are behind it through some of the stuff I did last year so I'm gonna see if we can get all our Oh coin it or something oh from the movie I get it all right anyhow that you talking about ready player one we're gonna throw quarters ready player one is it has been option for a movie but I don't see how the fuck they're gonna be able to do that but seriously though I'll get you I'm get you ready player one legend Zaku and chat says oh wow rocky or a picture show finally has competition now hold on Becky wants to go to there's there Rockies kind of like it's just there can be more than one movie in the theater at a time and Rockies just always there's always more than one cult movie repo the genetic opera for example is really big on the midnight circuit right now how do we in the area inch was for a while I think still is in some places clue the movie will always show up once a year somewhere you know there's there's other movies that show up too I don't think it's necessarily about competition usually the same people that are in a rocky or in all the other stuff too so anyhow anyhow off subject we're trying to wrap up the show I was gonna say thank you very much for downloading the show and tuning in to us hey if you like what you hear all we ask you know we don't put commercials in the show we don't make you buy things or whatever all we ask tell people about the show spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar website we rely on you guys to help spread the word of orange lounge radio and we really really appreciate it orange launch radio comm is the website the forums are there if you want to post on the forums I have to say though right now it's locked down to new accounts because yeah we were really getting killed with spammers there so I just shut off accounts all together so hopefully within the next month or two we're gonna just totally revamp the forums and hopefully be able to avoid the spam bots if you really want an account on the forums in the meantime email the show directly and we'll set one up for you mailbag at orange launch radio comm if you don't already have one and legend Ozaku I totally agree what's that Priscilla queen of the desert is the closest thing that can take on Rocky Horror Picture Show um that's a Broadway thing now so yeah they it's I it was supposed to come out on Broadway I'm pretty sure it did so all right anyhow that's it now we're talking Broadway we're way off the subject of video games we'll be back next week to talk more games and gaming news with you guys so have a wonderful week
