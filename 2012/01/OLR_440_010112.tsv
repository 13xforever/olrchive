14084	24800	Tonight, January 1st, 2012, DLC is finally coming to the 3DS, Valve says Half-Life 3 rumors are just trolling, and a fan remake of a computer game classic has been released.
31687	36969	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37169	38469	Orange Lounge Radio.
38589	42290	It is episode number 440 for this January 1st, 2012.
43271	44251	Really easy day to remember.
44651	51333	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk video games with my co-host, first off, the one, the only, Jamie Summers.
53234	54674	Or DarkSakura, whatever you want to call her.
55254	55734	How are you doing?
56034	57535	When people get my name right.
59076	60557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
78146	84111	He had a family engagement, I mean it is technically a holiday, New Year's Day, and so sometimes there's family stuff, especially with the new baby he's got.
85011	87593	So they've got a family thing going on, so he's not here tonight.
87613	89675	That baby is not as new as that baby once was.
92037	93518	He better have the baby thing down.
93558	95459	That baby's getting older just like you.
96320	96720	And you.
97881	102765	But joining us tonight, as he tends to do when we need another host, please welcome to the studio, Alan.
102805	103466	How you doing, Alan?
103546	103906	Hello.
104566	104967	How are you?
106004	106504	and DarkSakura.com.
124233	132716	The week before that, though, was our last show, and that was the last show from Studio DarkSakura, or the fifth studio in OLR's history.
132876	133076	Yes.
133236	135237	But tonight we are in a new studio.
135257	138038	It's Studio 6, and it's from Alan and I's place.
138358	138558	Yep.
138938	139818	So... Rob.
139979	140159	What?
140259	140999	Watch your grammar.
141279	141459	What?
141699	142039	Mine and Alan.
142059	144100	It should be Alan and my house.
145799	146800	How about Shut and Up?
147420	148441	How about Bite My Butt?
163574	166616	3rd, no, 2nd studio we were in, which was when Loki and I lived together.
166816	167756	It was a while ago, right?
168217	171198	We actually did the show kind of in the dining room and in the living room.
171218	172439	There was antics that always happen.
172659	175720	That's kind of a similar setup to what we have going on right now in this Studio 6.
176020	182584	So we're hoping at some point we can return the live streaming of games and stuff during the show over one of them stream and video websites.
182824	184185	We used to use JustinTV.
184685	185865	I've done stuff on Ustream.
185945	186246	I don't know.
186346	187466	I don't know which way we'd go.
187526	188967	We'll figure that out when we actually have video.
189187	193450	I now have experience doing custom graphics for Justin, for not for Justin TV, for Ustream, so.
193910	194270	Hey, hey.
194831	194951	Yep.
195371	195651	Awesome.
195891	197392	I did them for you, for Umlaut.
197612	197893	All right.
198893	205257	Say hello to the chatters, chatroom.orangeloungeradio, or excuse me, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
205617	206778	I'm a little rusty after a week off.
206798	212582	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can join us if you want to talk live with us here on this New Year's Day.
213123	215825	And it looks like we have a Bobby Blackwolf Did he just join?
216565	220527	Hi Bobby How come Bobby could show up for our show but he couldn't be bothered to do his own show tonight?
220547	239818	That's because he likes our show better As I said to the all games chatters, Bobby didn't want to work, he just wanted to bang on the drum all day That's a joke because he does drumming stuff for the Atlanta Falcons So my mother is calling me on my cell phone right now, like doesn't she know I have a radio show on Sunday nights?
239858	240399	Doesn't she know?
241440	242201	Maybe she's listening.
243002	245086	Rob, what do you mean you moved the show to your house?
245186	246408	Rob, did that cost money?
246668	247049	Rob?
247750	248130	Rob?
249332	249613	Anyhow.
250629	254272	We are live, of course, Sunday nights, every Sunday night, even when it's New Year's Day.
254613	260458	And All Games Radio is the kind and gracious network that allows us to steal their bandwidth no matter what studio we're in.
261058	267824	www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, typically after the Bobby Blackwolf show when he's, you know, not off drumming.
268225	269986	Tonight, after the show, R9 cast.
270026	273769	They had a jumbo episode because they are usually on it for Pacific.
274150	275010	And they went long.
275511	276632	They had an extended edition.
276852	277713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
298126	299427	I think I might have caught a couple.
301047	304088	But the flea market is basically... I don't know how to describe it for those that have never been.
304108	308510	I imagine everybody's been to one at some point in their town, but then some people might not live in places big enough that have them.
308550	308870	I don't know.
309270	311591	But they're basically like gigantic garage sales.
311971	313192	Is that an accurate description, Alan?
314412	316773	Well, yeah, I guess you could say that.
317173	319634	A lot of the wares are new and handmade, though.
319694	323636	It's not all recycled junk, but... I like to think of it as a giant thrift store.
324056	324796	Yeah, yeah.
325896	326377	That works.
327037	327177	So...
327774	328814	Huge farmer's market.
328854	330475	Probably the biggest farmer's market I've ever seen.
331015	331195	Yeah.
331255	334175	The one here we have locally in the Sacramento area is just gigantic.
334295	338036	So one of the things that's fun to go shopping for is produce.
338376	339356	And we bought blood oranges.
339476	339676	Yes.
339776	342537	But the other thing that's fun to go shopping for is video games.
342577	345018	Because there's a lot of people that will bring out their old shit.
345598	353459	And even I saw arcade machines for sale in some of the little side... They have a side auction.
353519	354019	It's weird.
354560	356200	So in the side auction, they had...
357059	358160	It's technically a different one.
358380	359240	It's Auction Town.
359401	359601	Yeah.
360561	362242	So it's not part of Deny-Os where we went.
362663	366925	Well, we saw Burger Time for $950, like a legit arcade cabinet.
367186	368787	And the cabinet was in good shape.
368967	370147	It was pretty good for its age.
370408	373089	Considering that game is from, what, 82?
374150	376352	Maybe somewhere around there, 82, 83.
376672	380094	Considering that game is as old as it is, that machine was in beautiful condition.
380114	380634	It was $950, and I was like,
381995	382455	Alan!
382775	385836	Did you see what was on the other side of the machine next to it?
385956	386396	No, what was that?
386696	389036	A berserk in just as good condition.
389096	389576	Wow.
390177	392997	Like that's the old one with the little bouncing ball, like the little happy face.
393417	394017	Good times.
394897	396438	But we did buy video games.
396538	397658	At least I know I bought video games.
397838	403459	I bought SingStar Queen, which I've talked about on the show before that I wanted it, but I wasn't going to get it until it went on sale.
403519	407620	Well, I guess I forgot to get it amongst all the other video games that came out last year because it was a crazy year.
408280	411782	and I bought Seeing Star Queen for $8 at the flea market.
411802	414764	That was awesome and it was sealed.
414804	415944	It might have been resealed.
415964	419626	Sometimes the stuff at the flea market, they've used the little machine to reseal it, but it worked fine.
419666	420467	I played it the other day.
421527	422648	And then I bought, get this,
423308	423909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
443687	469223	it didn't play exactly like the board game like it kind of put this logic puzzle twist on it where it would tell you like the lead pipe was in the conservatory and you have to kind of like tie it all together so if if Miss Peacock was in the conservatory then she must have had the lead pipe you know that whole thing so um yeah good times so it's cool to play retro games and a favorite of mine was Clue on the Super Nintendo for no particular reason it wasn't really that great of a game but it's
469738	472579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
499033	500974	I did and we ate them all last night.
501194	501974	Oh my god.
502334	504195	That tortilla lady took you to the cleaners.
504555	506415	I bought two for three.
506615	507336	That's not bad.
508016	509556	Two bags and there were six in each.
510717	512157	I did what she suggested.
512197	516798	I got pumpkin tortillas which were amazing because pumpkin everything is awesome.
516858	518759	You know it wouldn't be OLR if we didn't have a food tangent.
519079	520721	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
539178	540279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
554304	556025	I think you're projecting a little bit.
556345	557066	Just a little bit.
557666	565872	Well, the thing is that I had a lot of amazing Super Nintendo games with the box and instruction booklet and they were all in perfect shape because I treat my stuff very well.
566692	574758	They've all been sold on eBay years and years ago for a lot of money and I was kind of reminded actually of the price of how some of those games go for at the flea market.
575898	577800	Was it the Super Nest Lufia?
578220	578480	Yeah.
578520	580421	It was like 80 bucks you wanted for that cart.
580842	582343	So yeah, there's still some rare stuff out there.
582383	583704	I used to have them but I got rid of them.
584584	585904	You know you guys are welcome to borrow.
586785	589825	If you have the wild hair to play anything, you're welcome to borrow anything I've got.
590045	596167	I think most stuff on the Super Nintendo, I don't know, it's really like I'll get an urge to just play it.
596347	601008	I'm usually trying to play the new stuff to keep on top of stuff.
601308	605349	It's very rare that I'm like, oh, I want to go play Clue on the Super Nintendo.
605369	608430	But when it's right in front of me, I go, I remember how cool this game was.
608470	611031	I need to just pick this up and take it home because it's half off.
611311	611651	I paid...
612831	614132	How many did you get through?
614293	614673	Not even one.
637714	639595	We're toward the end of what we just got.
640695	642715	When we last played, everyone got their upgrades.
642975	644556	You got through Final Fantasy 1-2.
644636	646296	That's Final Fantasy Half.
648817	651298	Anyway, something about just starting off with 6.
653798	654999	Sitting down and going through 6.
657150	670748	I like 4 don't get me wrong but 6 is one that we'll just take turns with because I know that game like the back of my freaking hand I've played through that game so many million times or Chrono Trigger because then it's just a matter of New Game Plus
671769	672350	Super Nintendos Never Die
691269	692429	Those things are pretty durable.
692990	693810	And I thought this was interesting.
693830	702553	Kaijudo kind of followed it up a little later with, the sad thing is 20 years from now, I doubt many people will say they have a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 that still works.
703093	703854	How true.
704774	707515	I mean, the old systems were quite durable, weren't they?
707775	710956	And they were all just hard plastic with a little green circuit board in it.
711156	711337	Right.
711357	712437	I mean, not many moving parts.
712757	720904	I think Dan said that they had dropped a Super Nintendo down two flights of stairs and it still worked when he was a kid.
721044	721825	Those things are rocks.
721945	722585	I mean, they were.
722886	727129	But yet, an Xbox 360, you're lucky to get one that never red rings.
727149	730272	You knock it over once onto the carpet and it's dead.
732677	733138	That's true.
733178	736862	They sure don't build them like they used to, but of course, a lot of that could be, to be fair.
737183	744271	We did make a conversion somewhere along the way from cartridges to CDs, therefore DVDs, therefore Blu-rays.
745052	747215	That was a pretty major shift in format.
747537	772588	well you can even see just in model releases they go from being super sturdy like I have a first model PS3 and it's still in perfect condition it still plays everything wonderfully well but then you get the newer ones the slims and they're just they feel like nothing they've got no durability they're missing options and they cost you know when they were coming out they were costing as much as the old models did
773516	774897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
798095	799537	Oh, awesome, because I do have Keyboard Mania.
799577	799958	It's in the trunk.
799978	803163	I was going to say, if you wanted to hold on to it and do doubles, you're welcome to.
803183	804786	So now I'll have to get out my PlayStation 2.
804886	808011	Anyway, so yeah, flea market shopping, that's one of the things, fun things we did.
809238	817081	And also I saw in chat, Actdeft says a friend shops on flea market swap meets and resells the stuff he finds on eBay for a living.
817521	823223	I believe DarkSakura was actually talking to one of her friends there that she used to buy a lot of stuff from who said that he doesn't haggle.
823243	823703	Trader Dan.
823843	824183	Trader Dan.
824203	829665	He doesn't haggle really because he knows that if they haggle with him, they're just trying to remarket it on eBay.
829705	829985	Yeah.
830325	831025	That's exactly what he said.
831085	837308	And he's actually said he stopped dealing on eBay and he's doing like on eTrader or something, some website.
837728	839088	Yeah, I caught that end of the conversation.
839108	842089	He seemed very irritated with eBay and Amazon.
842129	843170	I'm not sure what happened there.
843190	850973	I mean, Amazon... He used to just completely resell everything, all the good stuff on eBay.
851113	854694	Well, and didn't Amazon kick everyone in California out because of the whole tax thing?
854954	855414	I don't know.
855514	855954	I think they did.
856335	857455	But I don't think he did Amazon.
857515	859776	I think he was strictly eBay and Yahoo.
859996	860116	Hmm.
861533	862053	Very interesting.
862874	863174	All right.
864335	865356	I like this comparison.
865376	866077	Very interesting comparison.
866097	869580	Then we'll move on with How Was Your Gaming Week here in the chat room from SepWin.
870581	874664	CEPWin in the chat at chat.orange.com says, It's like buildings.
875165	882411	Do you think the biggest NFL stadiums will be around 100 years from now, let alone 2000 as the Roman Coliseum?
883359	884260	Well, here's an example.
886981	888602	I'm sure I've made no thing.
888662	889563	I'm from Mobile, Alabama.
890243	894806	We have a building that was recently restored that was built in like 1850 something.
896027	898848	You know, maybe after the city was like 150 years old.
898868	898928	And...
902690	910413	It's still in, even when it was run down, it was still in sturdy condition and lived through years of hurricanes.
910573	911934	A hundred years worth of hurricanes.
912494	917356	Where we had, you know, some of the newer buildings had been flooded down and were corroded and everything.
917756	926379	So just even as an example, in a couple hundred years, you know, construction, we're leaning towards cheaper things that they don't last, right?
926499	928260	Well, a lot of stuff is built for the environment, too.
928320	930961	Like, here in California, you don't have brick buildings because of earthquakes.
931421	932241	Yeah.
932481	936142	But in Alabama, almost everything is made out of brick and concrete.
936202	937103	Yeah, it's just interesting.
937883	940324	And buildings are cheaper there, ironically.
940404	940664	True, true.
941164	947146	Even though they'll last through probably more hard weather than California sees.
947526	947986	Thanks for watching!
963795	964756	Well, construction.
964956	965096	Yeah.
965436	968758	Alan, you didn't end up buying anything at the flea market, but did anything catch your eye?
969218	972380	Like if you had the money burning a hole in your pocket?
973600	978803	Trader Dan had a lot of big promotional standy things.
979063	984086	Like he had that big Samus Super Metroid thing that was like six or seven feet tall from Super Metroid.
984126	984386	Oh, yeah.
984406	985847	You know I wanted that from the new studio.
985947	988749	It's probably not for sale because he has it mounted way up high on the wall.
988929	989129	Yeah.
989269	989689	But, yeah.
990590	990790	Yeah.
990950	993992	I don't know, he'd sell almost anything if you offer him the right amount, so.
995514	999237	Well, no, because we've bought some stuff that was just on the collection wall before.
999397	999657	Nice.
1000157	1002219	But that was back when he had the store in Rio Linda.
1002339	1005442	Well, you know, we put some pictures in the new studio up at orangelawnradio.com.
1005462	1009305	There's a little picture bar towards the top of the screen, and you can kind of see some pictures that we take.
1009685	1014909	I know what the website says, you can send in your own pictures, but due to some abuse things we had happen a couple months ago, we had to pull that.
1015210	1019253	So it's only the hosts, really, that are adding stuff to that, and we just added a bunch of pictures from the studio.
1019653	1020294	So there's...
1021014	1023897	You can see the scrolls and things like that, so it's pretty cool.
1023997	1033146	Yeah, but it was funny looking at the flea market at the big collections of the Game Gear and the Atari Lynx and both the console and the cartridge.
1033587	1036129	How did anyone ever try to market that as portable?
1036830	1037531	Either system.
1037611	1039913	They were both huge.
1040093	1041355	Well, look at an old school Game Boy.
1041375	1044037	Do you remember the commercial with the guy sitting on the toilet playing the Lynx?
1044278	1044418	Yeah.
1045158	1073057	and I had a Game Gear and I remember it went through four AA batteries probably every 72 hours and it's like worse battery life than a 3DS it weighs four pounds like how is that ever but yeah it was neat seeing all of that really old hardware well go look at an old school Game Boy like those things are fucking bricks but I remember you would have the case for it and I would put it in a backpack and take it to school and it was portable you know back then I just had an inspiration Rob what you know how the people built the house out of Legos
1074198	1076021	I want to build a house out of Game Boys.
1091337	1091817	Seriously.
1091837	1092698	That might be tricky.
1093258	1093979	An entire house?
1093999	1096461	You might be able to get a doggy house.
1097121	1101124	Well, you know, maybe like a little office or a storage room or something.
1101164	1105467	But I think that, or even just do a wall, a wall of Game Boy's.
1106748	1107648	Like a modern art piece?
1107888	1108869	Yeah, instead of, you know.
1109029	1111931	The 8-bit gaming exhibit that they do?
1111951	1118796	But, you know, instead of tile, you know, with the plaster, tile and plaster, do plaster in Game Boy's.
1120236	1121157	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1132936	1134357	Lots of World of Warcrafts.
1134458	1139382	Actually, not a lot because my computer was off for close to a week.
1139862	1141124	And then we just got our cable back.
1141544	1142965	Yeah, you had no interwebs for like four days.
1143005	1145588	Yeah, so I had to come over here on Christmas Day.
1146168	1147129	I remember that.
1147269	1149331	To get my damn Merrymaker achievement.
1149811	1151593	Open presents under the tree in Ironforge.
1151673	1158179	Yes, I remember that because then we went out for... Nothing's open on Christmas, but we were able to find that Pha was open on Christmas.
1158419	1164020	So as a proper Jew, I had Asian food on Christmas Day, even if it wasn't Chinese.
1164261	1165701	I remember putting a tweet or something.
1165721	1168522	I was like, two gays and a Jew walk into a pho bar on Christmas.
1169582	1170302	It was delicious.
1170322	1171262	Yeah, it was very good.
1171322	1171783	Delicious.
1172603	1181445	And I played, well, once everything got hooked up, I played a little bit of Fractal, which I really like that game.
1181505	1183626	Yeah, you talked about that last week on the show, or two weeks.
1183886	1184106	Yeah.
1184326	1184806	Very pretty.
1185307	1193304	And we played rock band, of course, like we do every party that we have The quintessential party game Yes, and Bradley came over
1194019	1194880	Oh, Arcadian 42.
1195020	1195180	Yes.
1195200	1196442	We need to get him over here in the new studio.
1196622	1197903	And he brought cymbals.
1198504	1203709	And then he proceeded to impress the cousins with his prowess in pro drum mode.
1204550	1205531	Oh, he does the pro drumming.
1206131	1206572	Very cool.
1207613	1214820	And we had... Well, when I left the house, Dan was watching a playthrough of Gradius on the...
1216701	1218903	Game Boy, like the old school Gradius on the Game Boy.
1219403	1220724	Because I saw little Moai heads.
1222044	1226487	We did, I think we did have a little bit of Proteus going on in the house.
1227327	1228148	So that was fun.
1228388	1230169	But mostly it was just putting up games.
1230609	1234611	So I've probably touched a couple thousand games this weekend.
1234991	1235932	Literally touched them.
1236932	1239113	But as for playing them, that's a different story.
1239173	1241135	And then there's also the flea market games that you touched.
1241175	1243456	You put your paws on a lot of those too, digging through things.
1243476	1243676	Yeah.
1244036	1252486	Yeah, I really did try to... It's sad going to Trader Dan's, though, because the stuff that he had out, the stuff I would have wanted, was the stuff I already have.
1253647	1260736	So I'm like, well, see, that's why I was asking who had a Master System, because we have spare games.
1261337	1263219	We do literally have spare Master System games.
1263559	1269520	Which, by the way, any of our listeners, if you have a master system, send me a photo of your master system.
1270401	1275842	And the first person that sends me a picture of their own personal master system will get a game.
1276022	1276642	Where can I email that?
1276662	1277882	Because you don't have an OLR email anymore.
1277902	1280423	Mailbag at OrangeLunchRadio.com Show email.
1280523	1280803	All right.
1281003	1282963	Mail the mailbag.
1283283	1285824	And it has to be your master system.
1286184	1315536	Don't Google the picture Maybe they need to put You need to tell them to put a little post-it note that says OLR So we know they didn't like Google it OLR, has to have a post-it note And keep in mind, I'm a designer I can tell if you photoshopped it Yeah, or something If you don't have post-it notes for fuck's sake Just scribble it on a notepad or something And maybe I'll be kind enough And if you've got a power base converter I'll accept that as well Alright Anyhow Inadvertent contest here on the show Alan, why don't you go next
1317361	1319882	It's been several months since I've been on OLRs.
1319942	1321603	I've actually completed a lot of games.
1322603	1325864	I remember Dragon Age Origins that came out in 2009.
1326264	1329885	A couple months ago I fired that up and I just couldn't let it go.
1331046	1334687	Between that and the expansion Awakenings, I completed both of those.
1335607	1339868	I think I've logged nearly 100 hours on my Archer Ranger Rogue that I rolled.
1340008	1341729	I never realized you finished Awakenings.
1342249	1347390	I saw that you moved on to Dragon Age 2 at one point, and I was like, oh, maybe he just finally got ADD, and he was like, I gotta go play the sequel.
1347630	1348611	I didn't realize you finished Awakenings.
1349151	1350151	It's good.
1351211	1357933	Pretty much with any RPG now, I use a FAQ or a walkthrough to play it, just because I'm old and lazy, and I don't want to miss things the first way through.
1358133	1359013	There's something secret.
1359593	1360654	So yeah, I used FAQs.
1361254	1366115	Dragon Age Oranges was about 70 hours, and Awakenings was about 24 hours before I beat it.
1366995	1376118	So yeah, I played a little Dragon Age 2, which got derailed by Skyrim, because Steam had Skyrim for $40 for 24 hours during its holiday sale.
1376218	1380900	Which, for the game that a lot are calling Game of the Year, that just came out a couple months ago, is a steal.
1381080	1384561	Yeah, so $40 for Skyrim, which is what I'm actively playing.
1386341	1390863	Just a PSA to live listeners, the Encore sale is going on today, and that is $40 again.
1391063	1392243	Oh, so they brought Skyrim back for $40.
1392303	1393064	Yeah, but that'll be it.
1393084	1393244	Exactly.
1394204	1394885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1411941	1412962	I really don't know.
1413222	1413942	I'll have to ask.
1414122	1416123	I'm curious if the folks... Do we have any chatters?
1416143	1418084	I'm going to have to go home now and check my Steam.
1418124	1419085	I can't do it during the show.
1420646	1422006	Unless there's Steam for Linux now.
1422047	1422447	I don't know.
1424008	1424408	I'm curious.
1424428	1426129	Yeah, did the folks in chat...
1426949	1427209	No?
1427389	1427790	Do we have any?
1428010	1429191	I see Ake Ripper in chat.
1429271	1430332	Ake Ripper, can you use Steam?
1431172	1431592	Sweden?
1432413	1432873	Close enough.
1433034	1438017	You might be able to log into the Steam website and buy something on the website on your account and then it'll download to the client.
1438037	1438838	I just wait till you get home.
1438858	1439378	You have till 10 a.m.
1439418	1439718	tomorrow.
1440959	1450206	Yeah, so I'm kind of juggling Dragon Age 2 and Skyrim right now and those are both pretty meaty meals of a game so I don't know how long I'm gonna be able to juggle those two.
1450686	1456688	I got a DSi XL for Christmas for my lovely, kind, generous boyfriend in studio.
1457048	1461109	And because of my DSi XL, I've been playing WarioWare Touched.
1461489	1462390	Can we back up a minute?
1462410	1464170	Because this certainly caught me off guard.
1464190	1465871	Because I asked you, I said, what do you want for Christmas?
1465891	1467171	And you said you wanted a DSi XL.
1467231	1469071	I'm like, you want that?
1469352	1470932	Even though it costs as much as a 3DS?
1471812	1475934	So just for the listeners that might be asking the same question, why an XL?
1476014	1476534	Why now?
1476894	1477434	You got to answer.
1477634	1504180	well you have a 3DS and I can play yours when you're at work honest answer that and I have a thing I almost have a thing against Nintendo but the first generation of their little hardware portables I thought the DS original the DS fat was ugly and it looked cheap and the DS light was like oh okay this looks like a good device that's when I finally got on board with the DS was with the light
1505220	1533068	I just think with the weird analog stick on the right side attachment that came out for the 3DS I want the second generation and when I play Mario Kart 7 on your 3DS I can only do two races before my right hand is completely cramped because I have big giant spindly spidery man hands and it hurts to play so I have my giant DS XL and I've got a ton of DS games RPGs that I haven't played so
1534707	1535308	All right, fair enough.
1535428	1536289	Yeah.
1536309	1537590	When you explained it to me, it made a lot of sense.
1537610	1538030	I was like, all right.
1538391	1540693	And plus, now that I've really got my paws on one of those.
1540893	1541874	It's a really nice device.
1541894	1542635	It is a nice device.
1542775	1548001	It's kind of a bummer it was so late in the life and now a lot of folks have moved on because, you know, it's a pretty rock solid DS.
1548381	1556189	I just want to take a step back for just a minute and chatters have clarified Actdeft from Mexico, Steam sales work worldwide.
1556670	1556970	There you go.
1559557	1569139	So aside from MarioWare Touched on the XL, I also did my sort of annual playthrough of Half-Life and Half-Life 2 episodes 1 and 2.
1569619	1571060	I beat those from start to finish.
1571740	1575141	That's kind of like your version of DarkSakura's Christmas Nights, I notice.
1576641	1579902	Once or twice a year, I just get Half-Life fever and I got to play through it.
1580042	1583783	I just need to do Half-Life 2, like the proper Half-Life 2.
1584043	1584823	I haven't done that yet.
1585191	1590654	and some chatters in chat might be thinking about a story that happened in Gaming News this week and yes, we'll be talking about that later.
1591294	1592895	Wow, Bastion's five bucks.
1593575	1594136	That's a good game.
1594436	1594976	Very good game.
1595556	1596637	A lot of a game of the year list.
1596657	1598698	Speaking of game of the year list, I do want to get this out at some point.
1599639	1606342	I know it's 2012, but since we didn't have a show last week and the way timing worked out, we need to have a proper end of the year recap.
1606382	1607923	So we will be talking about our games of the year.
1608363	1611104	DarkSakura, myself, and Alan have picked our top three games of the year.
1611144	1612385	We'll get Loki's next week, guys.
1612405	1613185	Don't worry when he's back.
1613965	1616186	But we want to hear your guys' game of the year picks too.
1616326	1618547	So we have some posts on Facebook and Google+.
1619047	1624670	So if you haven't chimed in yet, go do that because we're going to do that in part B. And some of our picks might surprise you.
1625510	1652404	so I know that there are probably what three games that everybody's picking well we'll see maybe our lists are the same three maybe not but I want to emphasize there's no right or wrong answers and I gotta say just looking at Facebook and Google Plus I'm really impressed at the diversity of choices I really truly don't think that just because every media outlet says game A, B, or C is the game of the year means everybody else is on board like I don't think any two people have picked the same game very interesting so anyway
1653524	1654024	Sorry about that.
1654564	1654964	Where were we?
1654984	1655765	Your gaming week, Alan.
1657025	1658485	I really think that that's it.
1659145	1668128	As far as this week, I've scrambled around on the Steam contest for the holiday sale where you unlock Steve achievements to earn coupons.
1670208	1675409	Also, I have two coupons for 50% off any Valve game, good through, I think, the 1st of March.
1675449	1678270	If an OLR listener wants to add me on Steam, I'll trade them that coupon.
1679076	1682357	We actually have an OLR group on Steam that they could find you on.
1682497	1694081	So I played Psychonauts for about an hour and a half to be able to use my mind power that Pyromania to burn two squirrels because there was an achievement for cooking two critters.
1694781	1699502	So I played some games like Super Meat Boy has one yesterday that I need to go through.
1700243	1700763	So that's all.
1700803	1701503	I know you're doing that too.
1701903	1704905	So if you want to find us on Steam or any of that stuff, it's awesome.
1704925	1722578	On OrangeLaunchRadio.com, in the upper right-hand corner is this little box that says Extended Play, and you'll see all the logos for all the community social networking websites, and you'll see the Steam logo on there, and you can join the OLR clan, and you can say hi to Alan or Salacious Pop, and he'll give you treats, it sounds like.
1722899	1723039	Yeah.
1723059	1723339	Maybe.
1723599	1723859	Maybe.
1724240	1725280	He may not have enough for everybody.
1726581	1727242	My gaming week.
1728263	1730284	I've played a lot of hodgepodge kind of stuff.
1730324	1732946	Like I mentioned before, I bought Seeing Star Queen, Clue.
1733326	1738670	There's probably two games primarily I've been playing, kind of focusing on the past couple weeks.
1739451	1748817	First one I'll mention is on the 3DS, a port of one of my favorite games that I played for the first time last year, even though the game is actually a couple years old itself.
1749618	1752400	VVVVVV came out for the 3DS.
1752540	1754962	It's on the 3DS shop, I mean literally, like just last week.
1756102	1760524	And, you know, it's a very faithful port of the version that's on the PC.
1761244	1765606	You don't have the level editor, although they're saying that that may be coming in the future.
1765766	1770208	But you do have some, like, best of user-created levels, which is pretty cool.
1770888	1772729	and, of course, the game's in 3D a little bit.
1772829	1775171	I mean, it's not complicated 3D.
1775211	1777292	It's kind of like the NES classics.
1777472	1780674	It's like three different layers of 3D you kind of see things on.
1781875	1786438	But the game itself, VVVVV, is a great game, an excellent game.
1787216	1790957	Some folks may find it to be a little bit short, but I think it's well worth it for the $8.
1791577	1792677	Kick-ass soundtrack.
1793257	1795558	It's kind of very similar to Super Metroid.
1795638	1799639	Very easy gimmick, the whole gravity flipping thing, but it works so well.
1799659	1800679	I mean, it's a great game.
1801099	1801779	It's great.
1801819	1813082	And of course, as somebody who loved Commodore 64 and really grew up on Commodore 64, I love that the game has a lot of, you know, kind of tips of the hat to the Commodore 64 days, including the loading screen.
1813482	1813662	So...
1814202	1816483	I think the 3DS version is a worthy port.
1816603	1832927	I realize some people may have a hard time justifying, well, I just bought VVVV as part of the Humble Indie Bundle that was just out because it was one of the games from the third that came back and I paid five bucks for like 15 games that included VVVV.
1833727	1836169	Why would I go pay $7 in the 3DS shop now?
1836509	1837529	That's a damn good question.
1837650	1839491	Maybe it's not worth it in that regard.
1839611	1842713	But for me, I love the idea of having a portable version.
1842753	1845474	You know, sometimes you just want games to be able to have wherever you are.
1846035	1853939	Airport, you know, commuting or whatever it is that you're doing, you know, out and about, it's sometimes nice to have some games to go.
1854220	1857381	And VVVVV is a worthy addition to the 3DS lineup.
1858622	1859823	Um, let's see.
1859983	1871269	Otherwise, the other game that I spent a huge chunk of time playing is Star Wars The Old Republic, the new MMO that's out from BioWare and EA.
1872130	1875712	I did pick this up the 21st, the day after it was out.
1876452	1879914	and I've spent a good part of the past couple weeks playing it.
1879954	1883457	I have like four characters in the level 10-ish range.
1883557	1885838	Two of them Imperial and two of them Empire.
1885918	1888580	So I've gotten a good feel especially for the introduction parts of the game.
1892582	1893703	God, where do I even begin with this?
1894183	1896425	A lot of people are comparing it to WoW.
1897125	1924117	and I gotta say this comment first I'm really amazed with how pressed some of the Star Wars players are when it comes to WoW because the general chat half the time is nothing but talk about oh this game is so much better than WoW and oh this game just kicks WoW's ass and oh WoW is a kiddie game and they're just bringing pandas because it's a kiddie game I used to play WoW but it sucks now and it's like wow you guys hate WoW so much you can't stop talking about it
1926670	1928551	But that's not really a slam on Star Wars.
1928571	1930273	That's just a slam on the chat community.
1930593	1932334	I was comparing it to Star Trek Online.
1933035	1933955	Well, here's my point.
1934116	1935637	Let both games just be.
1936077	1940600	Because does Star Wars have a lot of inspiration from WoW?
1940961	1941241	Sure.
1941661	1945504	One of the classes I was playing, I was laughing because I'm like, this plays just like a warrior.
1945524	1948306	It even has a talent called Sunder and you build up rage.
1948366	1950167	I'm like, this is just like a WoW warrior.
1950688	1951969	But at the same time,
1952990	1958855	The questing in Star Wars, the Old Republic, is so immersive.
1959416	1961518	The voice acting really adds a neat element to it.
1961598	1965402	Of course, the whole Bioware touch of the conversation trees.
1965802	1970607	The fact that you can have your character be light side or dark side, even within...
1971147	1996482	The Empire or Imperial like you can be a bad Jedi or you can be a good Sith it's really funky how that works but I like that and the group conversation is really interesting too I've been playing the game a lot with Shane and like we will both kind of go out and quest together and he likes to have his person be good and I like to have mine be bad so it's kind of funny watching that struggle and you get to see kind of different outcomes and all that so it's neat
1998323	2004568	I wanted to finish my thought really quick though on the whole pressed Star Wars people and WoW.
2005048	2009031	WoW obviously got its inspiration from other games too, and that's important to say.
2009471	2013995	I think Star Wars is just this company's evolution of the MMO genre.
2014475	2015936	And the question is, does it work?
2016016	2020600	And my answer is, in most places, yes, but in a few places, no.
2021540	2032524	and I think any MMO is going to have this problem when it first comes out and that's kind of about finding the balance and I think that's where the game has its trickiest part right now is balance and a lot of that has to do with the economy.
2033004	2044729	The economy is really clouded, uncertain right now and it's really hard to make money and they just nerfed one of the big professions for that and so a lot of that needs some fine tuning but
2045129	2047051	You know, the game's only been out two weeks.
2047131	2048792	For an MMO, that's hardly anything.
2049092	2050813	I'm sure a lot of that will be fixed in time.
2051254	2058019	But the other thing I've got to knock Star Wars for, because this is something I keep saying every time I'm playing the game, damn, I wish they would fix this.
2059800	2063263	One of the reasons I love WoW is the community and the UIs that they've built.
2063843	2073531	And Star Wars desperately needs to open it up and let users make their own UIs and interfaces and add-ons, especially for things like the auction house, especially for things like targeting.
2074331	2075232	and things of that sort.
2075272	2080335	Because if you have two people and their companions out, healing is kind of a pain in the butt.
2080796	2084198	So I'd like to see some UI changes for that.
2085339	2089662	Some of the ways things are set up are a little weird and I just think the community could improve on that a little bit.
2090342	2119225	but it's I mean especially compared to I played Rift when it first came out I played Warhammer when it first came out I played you know I've played a lot of the Ion I played Ion when it first came out I played a lot of the other ones and this is really the first one where I was like wow this really is something different this is a neat experience this you know I like the story which is weird because I'm not even that big on the Star Wars movies like you know I
2119605	2120486	I appreciate them.
2120846	2125849	I understand why there's fandom for the old movies from the 70s at least, not the new ones.
2125929	2132913	But I get why Star Wars is popular, but I found myself really getting kind of sucked into the story, and it's really interesting.
2133253	2140277	And I really liked getting to kind of play this character that could be light or dark or neutral or what have you.
2140738	2143279	So the biggest strengths are in the fact that –
2145000	2147922	Every single player game element is great.
2148562	2151124	And you could go from 0 to 50 single player, no problem.
2151444	2160289	I think it really helps when MMOs have the mythology pre-built to then bring in... Because Lord of the Rings Online, obviously, Lord of the Rings is...
2161129	2164030	Star Wars Galaxies wasn't necessarily a bad game.
2164310	2165330	It was a game that made bad decisions.
2186716	2192685	Well, yeah, because they switched it up to make it more accessible in all the diehard people.
2193146	2193306	Right.
2193446	2196170	Don't alienate your primary fan base.
2196671	2198113	That's where WoW is at.
2198553	2202920	Because for some people, Cataclysm was the equivalent of the NXE.
2203841	2230993	and you know so anyway or new user what did they call it new user experience whatever it was called anyway but because Bioware doesn't as of yet have a good MMO pedigree they do have a great game pedigree I mean it's Bioware so I didn't really have any doubt in my mind that The Old Republic was going to be bad as just a campaign experience but a lot of people are wondering when once you get to level 50 are there I mean are there raids like what do you do once you're at max level
2231913	2236694	Apparently there are operations, I think they're called, which are the equivalent of raids, I believe.
2236714	2237414	And there's PvP.
2237574	2239094	You can do PvP at level 10 and all that.
2240035	2240915	But that's a good question.
2240975	2241835	I'm not really sure.
2241995	2245456	I'm sitting here as somebody who's been playing the game for two weeks, and I'm not really sure.
2246236	2250237	Because with Rift, Rift was a completely new property.
2250257	2256218	They had to do all that world building about the conflict, and there's this race and this race and blah, blah, blah, and why these big portals are opening up in the sky.
2257279	2275880	all the time which is a different problem altogether and it was just hard to really invest myself in the world that I was playing in whereas with Star Wars and WoW you have the mythology going back years and years that players already that's what brings people to those games I think
2277411	2289760	So to kind of try and wrap up, because I know I'm rambling here a bit, but to kind of wrap up my thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic, I think it's a good game, and if you're into MMOs, you'll probably want to pounce on this pretty quick, because a lot of people have been.
2290200	2296664	But if you're not sure, I say wait, because I think the game's only going to get better with a little more maturity and age.
2296764	2306030	And I think in six months to a year when they really have a lot of players in endgame and they have a lot of this ironed out, I think the game's going to be very neat.
2307191	2308091	is it a WoW killer?
2308352	2326719	I don't know I don't really like that term because I don't think like there's similar games out there all the time you know Burnout didn't kill Need for Speed and you know Call of Duty and Battlefield can compete you know it's just different and I it's expensive if you want to play both games that's the only bummer but
2328240	2329341	The games can coexist.
2329581	2331642	I don't think one necessarily has to cannibalize the other.
2331763	2336906	I think there's going to always be people that want to play WoW and there's going to be people that don't want to play WoW that want to play Star Wars.
2337827	2340149	There's going to be people like me that kind of want to play a little bit of both.
2341850	2342230	There you go.
2344072	2347073	Alan, I do want to quickly ask you, though, because you play a lot of MMOs.
2347093	2349514	You've come on the other show, Horde House, a lot to talk about WoW.
2349835	2350635	You play a lot of WoW.
2350675	2351616	You raid in WoW.
2351656	2352596	You're an endgame raider.
2352636	2354657	You're one of the tops of the server.
2355338	2357519	But you don't seem to have that same interest in Star Wars.
2358119	2361141	Is that because of your investment in WoW?
2361781	2362862	Is it a money thing?
2363102	2365263	Is it just being a hater?
2365303	2365663	What is it?
2365903	2372227	Well, I've dedicated myself to raiding with people 12 hours a week, which is a lot.
2373147	2378451	and I am comfortable with that arrangement for right now.
2378531	2382034	Once I get a job, I will probably have to quit doing that.
2382415	2383776	But it's a financial thing.
2383856	2387579	I've already staked my claim with my rating guild in WoW.
2388519	2394104	And yeah, I don't want to pay $15 a month twice for that.
2394784	2398587	I'm also on the year-long Diablo III Death Pact.
2400849	2408792	So I've pretty much said, yes, wow, regardless of how bad you get or how lame your patches are, I'm going to be sticking with you for a year, and I'm committed to that.
2409813	2411533	I don't really need Wandering Eyes for MMOs.
2411573	2412814	Though I will say, though, the reason why I...
2414798	2428890	The reason why I decided to start playing Dragon Age Origins until I beat it was the fact that aside from raiding, I am kind of burned out on WoW, so that's helping my console gaming more.
2429671	2433995	I've actually been more into WoW than I have been into WoW, which is really weird.
2434015	2441301	I don't know if that's just because I've had a lot of time off work, so I've had more time to play things, or the fact that I am loving Arcane Mage right now in Warcraft, but...
2442142	2451672	Yeah, like, I've really had to, like, I'll play WoW for a couple hours, then I play Star Wars for a couple hours, then I go back to playing WoW for a couple... You know, that's been a lot of my vacation when I'm not doing other more productive things, you know?
2451853	2452053	Yeah.
2452694	2454596	A lot of chatter's talking about Guild Wars 2.
2455537	2456698	Kaijudo, I think, kicked it off.
2456738	2457959	I cannot wait for Guild Wars 2.
2458600	2460282	That's gonna be my main MMO.
2461183	2462004	And yeah, I gotta say...
2462844	2464846	I'm really interested in Guild Wars 2 as well.
2465767	2470971	I'm hoping the payment model is the same as Guild Wars 1 where it's buy the game and never pay money again.
2471371	2472152	Would be great.
2473873	2475254	Not have to pay a monthly fee or whatever.
2478787	2480467	Yeah, I'm looking forward to Guild Wars 2.
2481748	2483648	That'll be another MMO I'm going to have to somehow juggle.
2484168	2484709	So we'll see.
2485549	2489770	I kind of think in the long run, I may keep... It's hard to say.
2489850	2492831	I've been off work this whole time, so I've been able to juggle two MMOs.
2492931	2497712	But when I go back to work, I'm probably going to have to pick one or the other.
2497732	2498992	And I've agreed to play WoW for a year.
2499032	2501833	I'm on the same thing where I've already signed the death pact.
2502653	2503834	I want to be, but I'm not.
2504455	2507918	But I think even if I had to choose between the two, I would choose WoW at this point.
2508258	2511221	Because I think Star Wars will get better with age.
2511702	2512102	Think about it.
2512162	2515105	I didn't start playing WoW until Burning Crusade expansion came out.
2516246	2517647	I started WoW with vanilla.
2519032	2519392	and hated it.
2519432	2519932	And hated it.
2520393	2522515	And then I played Burning Crusade and hated it.
2523435	2526738	And then I didn't even bother with any of the other stuff because I still hated it.
2526798	2529661	And then Cataclysm came out and I was like, I kind of like this.
2530862	2535025	So just me saying I don't want to maybe play Star Wars right now a bad thing?
2535285	2536046	Not necessarily.
2536726	2540009	I mean, God, look at my WoW addiction and that just took a couple years to grow.
2540129	2540309	So...
2541651	2547135	I think Star Wars will still be here in a year or two unlike some of these other MMOs that have come out.
2547996	2549177	Is anyone still playing Age of Conan?
2549857	2554341	It's not on the show roll because I think it would have been for last week but we didn't do a Christmas show.
2555862	2563228	Didn't SWTOR or The Old Republic hit a million paid subscribers the fastest out of even faster than WoW?
2563268	2563929	Wasn't that a story?
2564769	2568092	We're not covering it tonight, but they put out a press release saying that they have a million.
2568192	2571774	I think they've sold like 1.5 million copies of the game globally.
2572134	2573495	So that wouldn't surprise me at all.
2573515	2574156	They have that many.
2574176	2577858	Yeah, there's still one or two more weeks before people start getting rebills.
2578038	2581281	So the rebills is when they're going to be able to say that they have subscribers.
2581481	2581861	Exactly.
2583562	2583903	We'll see.
2584223	2584484	We'll see.
2585044	2585285	All right.
2585926	2587849	There is stuff going on besides MMOs in the world.
2588009	2590032	Quickly, some housekeeping and then we'll get into some news.
2591114	2594178	I already mentioned the game of the year we're going to talk about in part B. So stay tuned.
2594198	2596942	Get your picks in at our Facebook or at our Google Plus page.
2597103	2598985	And if you don't have us added on either of those pages...
2599446	2600446	Maybe you should take care of that.
2601967	2604568	Also, I want to plug some other things going on elsewhere.
2604768	2610290	One of them that I really, really need to plug and make sure you guys know about is something called The Big Battle.
2611111	2616173	And this is something that Derek from Dead Pixel Live, which is another show on the All Games Network, is kind of spearheading.
2616653	2625857	But it's a lot of community shows kind of all pitching in to try and make this thing a success and get more people at the table wanting to kick each other's ass.
2626977	2628918	In a good way, though, because it's all about fighting games.
2629398	2631778	The big battle this time is, I think, the big beatdown.
2632619	2633759	And it's all fighting games.
2634179	2640281	It's Mortal Kombat, it's Street Fighter, Arcade Edition, it's Street Fighter 3, it's Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
2641041	2642421	It's all these fighting games.
2643762	2651444	And we're trying to get as many people in to participate in the tournament to find out which show has the best fighting game fans.
2653064	2659105	So far, I'm the only one signed up from OLR, so I'm hoping some of you will head on over to TheBigBattle.net and change that.
2659185	2662146	Sign up over there on the beatdown board for one of the games.
2662206	2665927	Now, the only kind of deal-breaker for some people is that it's all Xbox 360.
2666887	2668027	So some of you have these on PS3.
2668047	2674649	See, I have Mortal Kombat and Super Street Fighter IV on PS3, so I couldn't sign up for those games, but...
2675189	2675729	Yes, you can.
2676269	2676690	What do you mean?
2676750	2677670	You can come to my house.
2678410	2679271	I guess I could, huh?
2679471	2679991	Yes, you can.
2680091	2681592	Would that mean you're going to sign up too?
2681832	2682412	Maybe I will.
2683332	2683652	Ooh.
2683672	2684513	Ooh.
2684573	2685033	Well, there you go.
2685053	2686834	And keep in mind, this is Gimpy Hand Lady.
2687834	2688154	You know?
2688514	2690335	You have an arcade stick that you could use, right?
2690455	2692776	We have several arcade sticks.
2694377	2695277	That won't be a problem.
2695817	2698019	Alright, so maybe, maybe we'll work something out.
2698039	2699740	But anyway, it's all on Xbox 360.
2700120	2705844	So Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter 3, Third Strike Online, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
2706405	2713390	Go sign up on the beatdown board at thebigbattle.net and say you're going to represent the OL Army or Team OLR.
2714010	2714971	They'll know what you're talking about.
2715191	2716252	Go sign up and...
2717052	2728835	I'll kick your ass soon if you're playing Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Because that's the one of the games that I do own on the Xbox 360 Which I find funny because you can't buy that game anymore Yet that's the game that has the most signups right now I think people just love the classics What else can you say?
2729556	2744200	So, go sign up Alright, other thing I gotta plug here The Geek-Life Awards You know, we've talked about this website before And part of it is because, you know, Dark Sakura is like, writes for it You still write for it?
2744591	2745212	Yes, I do.
2745312	2747894	It's just with the last semester, I slacked off on my writing.
2749275	2750195	You know how busy I was.
2750476	2763085	Well, the editors over there, which I don't believe was DarkSakura, because I think there's got to be rules against that, but the editors over there did nominate us as one of the best podcasts of the years in the second annual Geek Life Awards!
2763126	2763426	Woohoo!
2764147	2768793	But the funny thing is, another podcast that was nominated was Horde House, my show about Warcraft.
2769194	2773580	Right now in the poll, Horde House is beating Orange Lounge Radio for best podcast of the year.
2773900	2776204	I'm sure Extrovert had nothing to do at all with that.
2778007	2778307	DarkSakura
2806582	2808425	God, what are you going to do if you lose to Extifer?
2811209	2811589	I don't know.
2811609	2813352	I guess talk about his bleached asshole.
2815435	2815675	All right.
2815715	2816116	Good answer.
2816436	2816696	All right.
2817658	2820902	Speaking of Horde House, I should mention we haven't done a show for like two weeks over there.
2820922	2821984	Is that a correlation?
2822124	2823526	Bleach your asshole win an award?
2825706	2826607	Do you want to find out?
2826707	2826967	No.
2828487	2828727	Okay.
2828767	2835611	Anyway, I should say Horde House hasn't had a show for like two weeks and probably won't be back till next week.
2835691	2838392	And that's just a timing thing on X for a Nice Part.
2838452	2840533	Like I'm going to be gone for four days next week.
2840613	2841673	So, yep.
2842254	2842774	Good times.
2842834	2843314	Busy, busy.
2843374	2845455	But hey, it's the holidays so we can kind of get away with it.
2845885	2847206	All right, let's talk about gaming news.
2847286	2849768	Let's get back into what is going on in the gaming industry this week.
2850248	2858035	Not a lot come to find out, but there are some things going on we do want to bring to the table and talk about with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
2858575	2859436	Alan, start us off tonight.
2859816	2873387	So Nintendo, they've been razzed on so hard, especially by the gentleman that I am subbing for tonight, as far as their inability to embrace stuff that other consoles are doing, particularly online play.
2875328	2879972	But they are jumping on one bandwagon finally, and that is paid DLC.
2880973	2884135	Is it true that the Wii didn't, you couldn't patch games on the Wii, right?
2884175	2888138	There were no... You cannot patch games on the Wii.
2888498	2891501	And the proof of this would be what's going on with Skyward Sword.
2891861	2895004	They actually had to release this whole channel, and it's there in the Wii shop.
2895044	2904111	If you go look, one of the games I forgot to mention I played this week, I found I had extra points in my Wii balance, or Wii account, so I went and bought Blaster Master for the NES on Virtual Console.
2904151	2904251	Woo!
2904631	2910935	But as I was looking for the shop, I saw the Fix Your Game File channel for Skyward Sword, and I was like, that has to be embarrassing.
2911335	2914077	But yeah, they can't just patch Skyward Sword to do it.
2914117	2916018	They have to have a Fix My Game channel.
2916558	2922042	So even with their most up until the 3DS, the supplemental content, whether it be
2922782	2923142	Oh, absolutely.
2945994	2948575	and it's going to cost several hundred yen.
2948735	2950596	It's kind of vague right now when it comes out.
2951097	2959141	But yeah, you can expect with the online store that 3DS has where you can buy the old Game Boy Advance and the little...
2960994	2988670	DSWare games now when you buy a actual retail cart product you can eventually log in maybe either through the game or through your 3DS and buy bonus campaigns for it which is just money money money I mean look at Microsoft and Sony and all the millions they've made with pay to unlock launch day DLC that's on the disc I should say this though the Wii does have the Wii does have kinda download content
2989170	2989490	Okay.
2989891	2990111	Okay.
3013906	3015768	All of it was third-party companies that were doing it.
3015788	3019510	Because, you know, Final Fantasy, Square Enix, Rock Band is, you know, Harmonix.
3019871	3023153	So I don't think any of it is coming from Nintendo themselves.
3023313	3024554	So that's what makes us notable.
3024634	3029478	Both that, A, it's the 3DS, which, you know, we haven't seen DLC on the 3DS yet.
3029878	3032140	We've seen, you know, Buy the Game, right?
3032180	3033201	I just pimped BBB.
3034081	3035382	But we haven't seen DLC.
3035923	3038364	And it's Nintendo themselves now.
3038545	3039705	That's a big deal.
3039886	3040026	Yeah.
3040887	3041728	So I stand corrected.
3041748	3049579	Yeah, it did have the facilities for DLC, but this one for a handheld definitely is interesting.
3049739	3057770	And the Wii U, they've also confirmed that it's going to have paid DLC, but there's still a lot more we need to find out about the Wii U than just that.
3058394	3065000	Some comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com Yuki says, and here I was respecting Nintendo for not doing DLC till now.
3065500	3069824	Tiger Claws theorizing, who knows, maybe a new Zelda quest via DLC.
3070225	3072447	Kaijudo just says, yeah, the DLC sounds lame.
3073568	3079513	So maybe this begs the question, is this good news or is this bad news?
3081476	3083758	Dragon Age Awakening Dragon Age Awakening
3111641	3111961	Fable
3123788	3149240	Awakenings is closer to the model that PC games used in the 80s and 90s in that it was a proper expansion that was a good 20 or 30 hours of game which is about how long I spent on it with Dragon Age Origins before I played Awakenings I did go onto the Bioware store and buy some of their DLC and those were only like 2 or 3 hours long for 5 bucks but it was well done so they're not all terrible
3150858	3174329	Dark Tetsuya says my brother was commenting to me about Nintendo not doing DLC said Nintendo should have made new tracks for Mario Kart and yeah I'm kind of like I would like to see Mario Kart 7 get more tracks download content you know as long as they don't go down that path that you know we talked about Ridge Racer on the Vita a couple weeks ago on the show like sounds like they're doing a horrible thing but like every Mario Kart game ever has had 32 tracks except I think
3174969	3180512	The Game Boy One you could unlock all of the tracks from the original in, which was a hell of a deal.
3180552	3181132	You know what I mean?
3181152	3189136	But most Mario, you buy a Mario Kart game, you know you're going to get eight cups, four of them retro, four of them new, four, you know, it's like the same formula every time.
3189156	3192998	But I think it would be pretty rad if some more of the retro levels came back as DLC.
3193438	3197260	You know, I would support that as long as it was reasonably priced.
3197881	3199281	You know, there's got to be a limit to it.
3200022	3200202	But...
3202011	3202531	It would be interesting.
3202571	3206114	But I think there's a lot of ways that Nintendo could do this very wrong too.
3206194	3210118	And of course, pay to unlock content is the wrong way to do it.
3210968	3216332	Stuff that doesn't enhance stuff that's required for the core gaming experience would be bad.
3216872	3231842	Well, going down the same path, I got a story here about what's happening at the Wii U. The Wii U, obviously, not going to be out for a while, but some rumors out there that Nintendo is going to be doing a full-blown app store for the system.
3231902	3234284	So think like, you know, what iTunes has going on.
3235025	3238447	Right now, you know, they've got the eShop, they've got little stores that
3238767	3259182	but the Wii U supposedly is going to go one step further there's going to be a wide variety of apps it will be stuff that will operate on the Wii U itself like TV things like you see on Xbox 360 Major League Baseball but some things that will run independently on the controller because the tablet obviously is its own little screen or what have you
3259522	3259983	Thanks for watching!
3279483	3284206	So my thought is, well, are you really downloading apps to your controller then?
3284366	3288028	Or are you downloading apps that just play on your controller, but you can't really take them portable?
3288689	3293211	Unless something drastic has changed with the specs of the system, maybe they are giving that thing a little processor.
3293231	3293612	I don't know.
3294252	3297274	I would think they're not because they want to keep the costs down.
3298234	3298475	But...
3299415	3327656	it would be interesting if that's happening but they are talking about you know check your email browse the web do Facebook and maybe some little games too on that little device I could see where you know you have the controller in your bedroom and it's streaming from the device in the living room and you can kind of like surf the web from bed and all that but I don't know most people have iPhones iPads Kindles you know other devices for that yeah so I don't know if the Wii U is necessary but I don't know what do you guys think
3329921	3334464	I can see the advantage, especially if you just want one thing to give you all the convenience.
3335445	3337926	So, maybe that's a good thing.
3338707	3343330	Honestly, it makes me think of that... What's that laptop that my husband wants?
3343350	3344190	The Transformer.
3344891	3346972	Where you pull off the top and it's a tablet.
3347692	3349894	I think it might be something to that extent.
3350834	3352455	So, like, say that you're...
3353836	3363541	Here's just a very domestic example, but say that your Wii is your way of surfing the web, and you're looking for a cake recipe.
3364141	3367843	Put the cake recipe on your little tablet, take it to the kitchen, go make your cake.
3368623	3371505	I mean, I'm just using that as an example.
3371565	3372445	That would work.
3372986	3375447	I could see that in the little Nintendo promo they do.
3375627	3375727	Yeah.
3376247	3376988	Family Oriented Domestic Level
3391040	3401392	I don't know why the chatters are doing this, but they're putting app in the names of all these Nintendo franchises like App Zero, the App of Zelda, App Icarus, App of Time, Excite App.
3402033	3410083	One of the ones that was suggested by Giovedeo was App Crossing, and that made me think, oh God, there's where DLC could go really wrong, is Animal Crossing.
3410103	3410483	Hmm.
3410823	3411383	Oh, man.
3411763	3416805	I mean, it could be really good, but I could just see the easy cash-in on Animal Crossing.
3416905	3417606	You know what, though?
3417646	3422427	For Wii U, imagine Animal Crossing with Wii U. You can go to the island again.
3423568	3423908	Maybe.
3423988	3424348	Who knows?
3425086	3426787	DarkSakura, what do you have for us news-wise?
3450171	3451432	I have a little something.
3451752	3453713	Actually, it's a cease and desist.
3454593	3455234	My apologies.
3455874	3457675	That's later story.
3457835	3461517	You will cease and desist that story right now.
3461577	3462037	Yes, I will.
3462518	3463758	It's the UK prices.
3463938	3470442	Well, actually, the European Union prices for the Vita and the memory cards and stuff.
3471242	3473644	So here's some of the game prices.
3474224	3477106	Uncharted Golden Abyss will be €49.99 or £44.99.
3477246	3478527	Bond Nation Racer will be €39.99 or £34.99, respectively.
3478787	3480388	Everybody's Golf, the same.
3480408	3481869	Wipeout, 2048, the same.
3482410	3483150	Unit 13, also the same.
3483170	3484211	Little Deviants will be €29.99 and £24.99.
3484251	3486452	And then Reality Fighters is the same price as well.
3501222	3506727	So as far as the different bits that go with it, the 4 gig memory card will be $19.99, $17.99 pound.
3506767	3507368	8 gig will be $34.99 or $31.99.
3507408	3508168	And the 16 gig will be $49.99 and $44.99.
3508208	3510550	Lots of other stuff too, like the charger is $49.99 slash $44.99.
3510610	3511171	All these different...
3525803	3528764	Man, England, why do you have to stick with the pounds?
3528844	3533746	Actually, probably kind of a decent thing that they did given where the euro started going.
3533886	3539708	Anyway, I'm actually trying to get the price of the system on here.
3539928	3542129	While that's loading, why don't I just jump in here real quick?
3542169	3546070	In case you are wondering, you hadn't heard the US, American currencies.
3546130	3548011	I did pull up Amazon real quick to just kind of...
3548411	3552514	Most of what DarkSakura said, if you just replace Euro with dollars, it's pretty much the same thing.
3553114	3555776	The Wi-Fi system itself, $249.99 in dollars.
3556036	3558578	The first edition bundle is going to be $349.99.
3558898	3560380	The games right now are all over the map.
3560420	3561700	It just really depends on what the game is.
3561740	3562401	Like Uncharted, $49.99.
3562521	3563221	LittleBigPlanet, $39.99.
3563382	3564402	But like Hot Shots Golf...
3568385	3568685	Golf?
3568785	3569346	What is golf?
3569906	3570707	Hotshots Golf?
3570727	3571608	I know what GORF is.
3571828	3572548	It's a cool game.
3572608	3573469	GORF is a cool game.
3573729	3574610	Hotshots GORF.
3574690	3575150	I'd buy that.
3575511	3578733	Hotshots Golf, though, is $29.99, as is Wipeout 2048.
3579313	3582896	So I'm assuming maybe those games are a little... I don't know.
3582936	3583537	It's hard to tell.
3583617	3585058	Like, Touch My Katamari is also $29.99.
3585798	3587540	Is that indicative of the quality?
3588100	3588601	I don't know.
3588681	3589121	I hope not.
3589301	3592483	Well, we do have the list of the U.S.
3592903	3593864	release titles, too.
3594044	3597106	It actually says the full list from the U.S.
3597166	3597927	PlayStation blog.
3598807	3619101	On launch day, there will be Escape Plan, Hot Shots Golf World Invitational, Hustle Kings, Little Deviants, My Nation Racers, Road Trip, Super Stardust Delta, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Wipeout 2048, and as far as third-party stuff goes, just to look this over and point out the stuff that isn't absolute crap, as far as I know,
3619942	3629289	BlazeBlue, ContinuumShift, Extend This is just a great name, Army Corps of Hell Luminous, Electronic Symphony Is that launch day or launch window?
3629309	3634073	It says launch day What else is on here?
3635874	3638296	Plants vs. Zombies Rayman Origins
3640958	3655209	Touch of Space, Mutant Blobs, Touch My Katamari, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and as far as launch, Windows, Disgaea 3, Ridge Racer, Silent Hill Book of Memories.
3655789	3657911	So, we're seeing some stuff.
3659652	3661333	I think Ninja Gaiden, is that Sigma?
3661453	3661653	Yeah.
3662514	3664756	It's actually the Sigma symbol.
3665596	3666337	I know my Greek.
3667498	3667778	So, yeah.
3668326	3675271	Alright, so, yeah, Vita, I know I'm going to probably have to pick one up, now especially that I know Luminous is out Do you want to touch my Katamari?
3676231	3696084	I will totally touch your Katamari, I'll only touch yours if you touch mine Okay Alan, I know you're probably not going to buy a Vita the day they come out because, you know, you'll play mine when I'm at work, but what do you think about You're going to touch his Katamari when he's at work Yeah, probably Are you excited about the release at all or are you just like, eh, whatever, another system
3696884	3702528	I've heard Vita has had some mixed stuff going on in Japan, that there's been a lot of bumps in the road.
3703108	3716717	I don't really have the energy to stand or to be really fanatical about a system, but it took about two or three years, but the PSP, I thought, was a really good system, a really good handheld.
3716737	3716917	Yeah.
3718438	3743119	I really think that the PSP is underrated dare I say it because the DS which was phenomenal sort of steamrolled it which is a reality but I'm looking forward to the PSP Vita because I thought the PSP itself was damn good but I just financially and with the time I have towards games I can't really get all that excited about a launch day purchase like I would have been 10 years ago
3744306	3745728	So maybe for next Christmas though.
3745928	3747030	Yeah.
3747110	3748392	Once things get ironed out.
3748412	3753538	Well, no, next Christmas I'll want a 3DS because if I'm doing things two years late, then I'll want... Oh, okay.
3753619	3753859	Yeah.
3753999	3754520	Good to know.
3754580	3754900	Good to know.
3754920	3755942	I can start planning ahead.
3756603	3756883	All right.
3757243	3758665	Well, let's move on with some more news, Alan.
3759486	3760146	Thank you for watching!
3779258	3791060	He was basically answering speculation about a possible Metal Gear Solid remake because they are doing the HD remake for the PS3 of I believe it's Metal Gear Solid 2 and Snake Eater.
3791840	3795061	But Metal Gear Solid, the original, isn't a part of it.
3795161	3800082	So people are like, well, obviously that was the most famous of the three because it was groundbreaking.
3800622	3805063	It was probably one of the best looking games during the entire PS1 life cycle.
3805823	3809745	Does that mean that they're going to be releasing one separately?
3810805	3815808	And Kojima has just said, you know, that ultimately it's Konami's decision.
3817048	3823011	If they want to do a remake of it, that's fine, but he won't really, like, he doesn't care enough.
3823071	3826473	He thinks the game is perfect, or is good at it as is.
3826513	3829794	He didn't think any corners were cut that he would want to go back and rewrite parts.
3829954	3831715	He thought that the story was complete enough.
3832035	3833096	The first time it was told.
3833777	3841464	So they're welcome to do it, but Kojima's not really saying that he's psyched up about wanting to remake it.
3843448	3849613	Do you think it's worth it for them to put the time and effort into remaking the first game?
3849653	3857159	I mean, I kind of get why they're doing that, because I think they're probably taking the easy way out with the 2 and 3 remakes, you know, just quickly up-rezzing.
3857219	3863224	It's like with the God of War, which I know was Sony and not Konami, but it's just, they were already nice enough graphics that they could just upscale the textures.
3863304	3865185	Right, which is probably what's happening with Silent Hill, too.
3865705	3871330	But this, you know, going back and doing the first one would be, you know, they're not going to be able to do that as easy.
3871590	3883497	didn't they kind of remake one already for the GameCube with Twin Snakes yes that was the script and the voice acting was changed a bit but it was still ultimately that game the story was retold
3884056	3885077	And it was really great.
3885357	3891940	I mean, I thought it was probably... Of course, we have just about every Metal Gear thing that comes out, so it was really great.
3892740	3903305	Yeah, so with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes for the GameCube, that's kind of like if they did an HD remake of Resident Evil when we have the Resident Evil remake on the GameCube.
3903345	3905807	Again, totally different franchise, but it's the same thing.
3905867	3908688	Like, we've already kind of had that, so, you know...
3910695	3915625	Let's be real, if they remade Metal Gear Solid HD as a separate release, people would buy it.
3916006	3919012	So if Konami wants money, they should do it, but Kojima is just, you know...
3920339	3924482	He's not... But a lot of people would rather they just put that effort into making a Metal Gear Solid 5.
3925103	3925323	Yes.
3925403	3928346	Which, story-wise... Which obviously you would want Kajima on board for that.
3928366	3928666	Right.
3928686	3930347	Because it'd be a new story.
3930968	3931108	Right.
3931808	3933049	So... Alright.
3933470	3934230	Well, moving on.
3934250	3939014	It was brought up earlier in the show that Steam is having a crazy sale right now.
3939475	3942397	I wanted to just take some time to kind of talk about a lot of the crap that's on sale.
3942657	3943378	I did get Bastion.
3943658	3944379	I'm still looking at him.
3958880	3959540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3977769	3980130	What's also interesting is the competition that they're doing.
3980190	3981430	Well, it's a competition.
3981450	3982411	What's the right thing to call it?
3982471	3986072	The achievements for loot, basically.
3986452	3992534	They have these set achievements and with them you can win little coupons for games.
3992594	3994575	Like I got a 75% off Left 4 Dead 2.
3995155	3998756	Basically like have the sale anytime you want type of thing.
3999376	4019754	or you can get little pieces of coal and the little pieces of coal can either be contest entries into winning every game Steam has ever put out ever is the grand prize like you would never be able to play all that or I think you runner up prizes are like all the games on your wish list and like every Valve game ever made and you know things like that
4021455	4024037	What's interesting, I was reading about this and something I wanted to bring up.
4024117	4025317	I just read about this today.
4025758	4030421	I guess Steam ran out of the third party prizes.
4030461	4034383	Like if you get seven pieces of coal, you're only going to be able to get Valve stuff with that now.
4034844	4036765	There's nothing third party you can get with that now.
4037606	4047411	There was a game, I'm blanking on what it was, that was released on Steam, I think it happened a year or two ago, where they ran out of the license, like the codes, like the CD key code.
4047571	4048711	You get one of those digitally.
4049131	4054254	They didn't have, like they ran out, so they couldn't sell the game anymore because they didn't have the manufacturer's
4055354	4083973	so it's probably the same thing here they gave away the little free or the agreement was they would take the loss up to X many copies but a lot of people are upset because there's been those accounts out there that have kind of been abusing this we had a story a couple weeks ago about people were creating accounts just to trade the games and get the coupons kind of setting up all these sock accounts and Valve had to do this so a lot of people are kind of upset with the way this played out
4084853	4085534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4103912	4105733	I don't know, you've been trying to save up coal.
4106394	4107675	Were you going to cash it in?
4108235	4108775	Now maybe not?
4108875	4112318	I need two or three more, and I have no idea what is even available.
4112358	4116841	And now it sounds like, thanks to this story, there's even less available for me to look at, so I'm even less motivated.
4116881	4118482	Is there anything Valve you don't own?
4119983	4120623	Counter-Strike?
4120663	4125406	Counter-Strike and just stuff that I don't care about because it's multiplayer or whatever.
4125426	4126247	Yeah.
4128164	4149731	One thing, though, about this whole sale and these achievements is that it really shows how Valve works with the developers of these indie games, because especially with Toki Tori, whenever Valve has one of these sales on Steam, there will be several games that will get updates where the developers have designed Christmas content specifically for
4151641	4153562	Steam, which is unprecedented.
4153582	4158824	And Toki Tori had, it was basically the first world, but it was all re-skinned with snow and Christmas trees.
4159044	4161246	So the developers went in and added that for this sale.
4162126	4163246	And Super Meat Boy, same thing.
4163266	4166748	There's now a Christmas world for this sale that you can go in and play.
4166768	4168689	The one for Beat Hazard was mean.
4168709	4174452	You have to play 10 minutes of Christmas music without dying or without losing.
4174472	4177493	And I did it twice and lost at 9 minutes 30 seconds.
4177553	4178894	I was so pissed.
4179642	4182484	Yeah, so even the developers of Beat Hazard were like, all right, there's a Christmas sale.
4182504	4184165	We're going to add Christmas music.
4185406	4188027	Your Steam client will update the game automatically for this sale.
4188128	4191810	I can't really think of any other example of when that's happened.
4191970	4196833	Well, outside of Steam, yeah, but I was going to say the Portal 2 release.
4196913	4197794	Remember they had the whole...
4198314	4203738	Unlock Portal 2 early thing on Steam and they had special achievements and like Audiosurf.
4203778	4207701	Like I remember one day I went to go play Audiosurf and suddenly Portal 2 music just showed up.
4208221	4215667	Like I tried to play a song and it was like GLaDOS is taking over and suddenly it was a Portal 2 song that was really awesome.
4216227	4218569	So I like when they kind of do stuff like that.
4218589	4219390	Yeah.
4220510	4227835	But, you know, I like this comment from Derek H in chat, especially if the thing they are out of is digital and therefore not real.
4228035	4233679	That's frustrating, knowing that, oh, you just ran out of something that's on the internet.
4234439	4237041	Well, it needs a license, but yeah.
4237761	4238462	So, um...
4239142	4243365	Licenses themselves are more for inventory and marketing purposes.
4243445	4245746	Well, my thought was that they just have an agreement with the developers.
4245787	4249449	Like, hey, we're not going to give away unlimited amounts of 75% off your game.
4249529	4252471	It's going to be limited to $100,000 or something like that.
4253352	4257835	I think for the sake of those third-party developers, many of them indie, I get it.
4257935	4258615	And I cut them some slack.
4258655	4263718	Whatever they sell, they have to report back to the manufacturer because they have those agreements.
4264159	4264379	Yeah.
4265240	4266842	Sorry, I love Derek Hage's follow-up comment.
4267123	4268865	It's like running out of birthday wishes.
4269186	4273172	I was going to wish you a happy birthday, but I used up my last one three days ago.
4276894	4282559	When I woke up this morning, I had like five or six fucks to give, but now it's three o'clock and I don't give a fuck anymore.
4282859	4283219	You missed.
4283539	4284200	You're too late.
4284220	4287583	If you caught me a noon, I would have gave a fuck, but now I don't.
4288604	4292267	Actdeft in chat says, clarifies the abusing of this.
4292767	4297651	Sky, many people cheated and had multiple accounts on Steam to trade coals and stuff with themselves.
4300413	4301674	Why do you need all these fake accounts?
4301754	4302815	Get a significant other.
4303015	4304357	Alan and I traded stuff.
4307200	4309161	If I have any coal, you guys can have it.
4309742	4311302	There's nothing left to get with it.
4311583	4313544	This is why I don't even do this shit.
4314404	4315044	No, seriously.
4315184	4316345	I didn't sign up for any of it.
4317186	4317606	I'd do it.
4318246	4318926	Because you know what?
4318946	4320427	I have other stuff to do.
4320567	4323329	Well, when I'm the winner of every Steam game ever...
4323849	4324569	You can't play it.
4324729	4328691	Well, some of the achievements are have a wish list.
4329312	4331933	Make sure that your wish list has at least 10 things in it.
4331993	4333074	That was worth a lump of coal.
4333114	4344659	So if you created 20 accounts and you added 10 games to your wish list, you could then pipe all of those other 19 other coals to your... So some of them weren't necessarily game achievements.
4344719	4345960	It was just Steam interaction.
4345980	4347500	Well, then I'm sure I have a coal.
4347841	4348441	Yeah.
4349522	4350443	I'm too good for coal.
4350463	4351224	What are you talking about?
4351945	4353586	You want diamonds.
4353787	4362696	I guess what Sky's trying to say is that if you're forever alone.jpg the sale isn't for you then apparently because you need a partner to help you do this.
4363737	4365099	No forever alone on Steam.
4366403	4370408	Some folks are talking about Skyrim and I just wanted to say because this made me think about you've been playing Skyrim.
4370428	4371108	Challenge accepted.
4371269	4374473	Kaijudo in chat says, I want Skyrim on PC for the mods.
4374513	4375494	The mods are going to be sick.
4376855	4385025	I've been playing on PlayStation 3 and I've been watching Alan play it on PC and I'm like, now I kind of want it on PC because you had an inventory mod or something that...
4386014	4391118	I downloaded a mod from Skyrim Nexus that basically makes managing your bag.
4391179	4396022	I can sort by weight so I can see what all the heavy shit is that's weighing me down so I can get rid of it.
4396543	4397464	I can sort by weight.
4397544	4402808	I can sort by... Yeah, so it's an awesome add-on to make bag management in Skyrim awesome.
4403028	4403789	And you can do that on PS3.
4405850	4407711	Actdeft in chat says, Sky, you really have no idea.
4407791	4410352	There are people with over 100 multiple accounts.
4410732	4411613	Good thing they got banned.
4411673	4412733	Well, yeah, good thing they got banned.
4412913	4413973	At least Valve banned them.
4414554	4416354	Some companies may not have even caught it.
4416474	4418395	So, you know, at least they got banned.
4418435	4419436	But yeah, I agree.
4420056	4422597	You know, I don't think Valve is the type of company, though.
4422677	4424198	Again, I just kind of look at their track record.
4424258	4426579	Steam overall has been a great thing for the community.
4426679	4427179	It really has.
4427279	4427439	Yeah.
4428879	4445924	and I think in the long run they'll kind of look back at this and go okay next time we need to if we're going to give somebody coal for getting their wish list done we need to make it so that they can't trade that to somebody else who's already unlocked it for the same reason like they'll go back to the drawing board and I think they'll fix it for next time or they'll do something different you know
4446364	4447045	They'll learn from it.
4447085	4447605	I think they will.
4447925	4451608	But it does suck that it had its issues this time.
4453650	4453930	All right.
4454951	4455991	Let's move on with more news.
4457032	4458253	Gosh, we're having a long show.
4458373	4460995	How about the story that I was going to read?
4461135	4461716	How about it?
4461876	4464037	I guess I can lift that cease and desist order.
4465086	4470970	Well, actually, it was Activision that put out the cease and desist on a dude who hacked Skylanders!
4471070	4472472	Spyro Adventures!
4475294	4488523	Anyway, this guy named Brandon Wilson had hacked the game to where he basically figured out the conversation between the piece and the game so that he could basically mount any piece he wanted to in the game.
4489484	4508759	and so uh so so he figured out how that little little uh um toy and portal magic portal were talking to each other yeah and he got he put it up on the internet which of course that's what they send out the cease and desist right and um he wrote out um a note that said you know what uh
4510562	4512003	The accusations were inaccurate.
4512583	4513984	He wasn't really sharing them with other people.
4514004	4516164	He had them on a zip file for his own use.
4517425	4518746	He wasn't circumventing the game.
4519366	4528870	He was basically just using stuff that was available, not using the hardware on an iOS device.
4530410	4531711	He didn't really trick anything.
4532331	4533512	He just figured it out.
4533972	4534672	He just found it out.
4534732	4535953	He didn't actually use it.
4536670	4539911	Well, are you able to rip off Activision by doing this?
4540271	4543172	Like, you can't just suddenly magically... You can't buy the figure.
4543713	4548935	You can just make the... If you use another system to make it think you have the figure.
4549355	4551736	But doesn't... Isn't there still like a code for the DLC?
4551816	4554437	Like, you can't just magically download something that isn't there, right?
4554497	4557298	Like, would you be able to exploit and steal money from Activision by doing this?
4557838	4560479	Or is it just you figured out how magnets work?
4561300	4563722	Yeah, you figure out how magnets work.
4563742	4570028	Well, I mean, isn't there inevitably going to be somebody that wants to know how the magician does the trick?
4571109	4572771	Well, I'm double checking something on here.
4573091	4574652	Basically, I just found out how they connect.
4576795	4579257	So I'm trying to find where exactly he listed that.
4582187	4584688	I'm asking Chatters because I have not played Skylanders yet.
4584989	4589071	So Chatters, do you have to have a code to get the DLC?
4589091	4590651	He uses RFID.
4591512	4597074	He was just playing to figure out how it worked.
4597595	4599476	And he put up the way it worked.
4599656	4604058	And so I guess maybe it's Activision is afraid that someone's going to use that to steal.
4604198	4604978	Oh, no.
4605018	4607579	You mean if the game is successful, people are going to try to rip it off?
4607760	4608580	If it's successful.
4608600	4608700	Yeah.
4610150	4611370	I understand it's been doing alright.
4613971	4616992	Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
4617432	4620953	I think he just got bored, figured it out, and saved the information for himself.
4621373	4625034	And then Activision's like, oh my god, people are going to use it and steal from us.
4625994	4627575	All these five-year-olds with their toys.
4630436	4634837	DarkTetsuya in chat says, this talk of Skylanders makes me want a new version of Barcode Battler.
4637319	4639080	I wish you could see how I just rolled my eyes.
4639661	4640742	I remember those.
4641042	4645125	Since I'm subbing for Loki tonight, should I be throwing shit and screaming about Skylanders?
4645525	4646566	Because we're talking about it.
4646586	4646786	Go for it.
4646826	4647146	Go ahead.
4647346	4649168	But don't throw anything because all the stuff near you is heavy.
4649368	4656153	No, I was going to say, but this is, I wouldn't throw stuff in Dark Sakura's house either, but like everything that I would hit with is all stuff that we own.
4656233	4659695	So Skylanders makes me very angry there.
4659855	4660396	It's my Loki.
4661216	4662997	That was a pretty crappy impression.
4663317	4664898	Good job.
4665619	4672443	Folks in chat aren't really able to answer the question about Skylanders, but I do see Derek H. says, well, of course there's a delay.
4672483	4673283	There's like a minute delay.
4673704	4677286	Derek H. in chat says, so corporations are now trying to make it illegal to learn.
4679242	4681344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4698740	4705484	They've probably emulated it already or they have their competing version for their own franchise that's going to come out at the end of next year.
4706545	4713888	I think the thing is, though, that if this somehow allows people to download free DLC, then that's going to be an issue.
4713928	4721633	But at the same time, if they didn't think that far ahead, then I don't want to say they deserve it, but they were asking for it.
4721933	4723394	Hacker's going to hack, right?
4724174	4725315	Oh, boo-hoo, go cry.
4727196	4728676	Crimea River, Build a Bridge, and Get Over It.
4729017	4733279	Well, I'm pretty sure those figures have to come with a code that you have to input to actually get the DLC.
4733679	4739322	Otherwise, the figure just tells the portal, this is the one I want to use, or maybe we take it to friends' houses, whatever.
4739847	4752332	Well, if it works on just, you know, talking to... Because I think that that would make sense to not exactly have a code for it, but to have it just, you put the figure down and it connects.
4753393	4756734	I think that they might have been confident that no one would be able to figure it out.
4756954	4759575	But then again... That was a dumb assumption.
4759596	4761396	That was a stupid, stupid assumption.
4761416	4765278	But how many other video game companies have done the same thing is what I'm saying.
4765678	4767039	Again, I don't want to say they deserved it.
4767059	4769901	Our security is foolproof.
4769921	4775004	I don't want to say they deserved it in that case, but that wasn't a smart decision.
4775284	4775464	No.
4776485	4778006	But it's been going around.
4778106	4780187	It's a common thing amongst developers.
4780707	4781948	No one's going to figure this out.
4782048	4785230	Let's just be all confident and kiss our own asses.
4785870	4786231	No.
4787491	4787731	So.
4789733	4790053	All right.
4790549	4794954	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming to a store near you.
4795194	4796756	I kind of don't think there's a lot this week.
4796936	4797777	Wonder what that could be.
4797857	4799619	Could it be that the holiday period's now over?
4800961	4803103	But we'll see if there's anything after all.
4804044	4805285	Alan, you're filling in for Loki tonight.
4805306	4806467	What about the US releases?
4807324	4817833	Well, according to the source that we use, it looks like there's one solitary, sad little game coming out this week.
4818834	4825659	It's going to pick up next week, I believe on the 10th, as some of the 2012 Q1 releases are coming out.
4825900	4828041	Especially towards the 31st.
4828081	4829222	I think you have a couple big ones on the 31st.
4829242	4829342	Yeah.
4830103	4835888	Between now and the next episode of OLR, we have Anarchy Reigns for the 360, and that is it.
4835908	4837269	I don't even know what the game is.
4837289	4838510	Yeah, I couldn't tell you a thing about it.
4840471	4841012	So there you go.
4841792	4850479	I'm going to Japan to look at... Well, I'm not going there physically, but I'm going to look at their releases of things that are coming out, and I gotta tell you, I don't see a damn thing coming out in Japan.
4850519	4855683	I'm looking quickly to see if even the 3DS... Well, don't they have any Week 2 Vita stuff, or did it just have its...
4856664	4857545	3DS is outselling it already in week 2
4876244	4877085	Someone in chat was saying that.
4877125	4877926	I think it was Ranma.
4878027	4879488	It was like LOL at Vita.
4883233	4886197	Maybe this was the 3DS's strategy the whole time.
4886498	4887218	Sure, right.
4888040	4892746	But whatever it is, it'll be interesting to see if the numbers are the same here.
4893386	4895749	I don't want to be all fanboy and root for one or the other.
4895889	4899612	I'm interested in both, but it's certainly not a good sign.
4899652	4913886	If you look at the technology of what the Vita has feature-wise and what it's trying to do versus the 3DS, which is just, hey, it's a polarized 3D screen that you don't need glasses for, I think the Vita is trying to accomplish more with the technology that's in it.
4913966	4916068	But hey, sometimes that just goes to show.
4917148	4922190	Bleeding Edge Technology, and, you know, the perks aren't necessarily what move the system.
4922811	4923151	All right.
4923611	4926772	Well, no releases in Japan this week, so how about Europe?
4927113	4932335	Well, to quote a line from one of my favorite movies, Spaceballs, we ain't found shit.
4934276	4934596	That's it.
4935597	4936657	A very slow release.
4937017	4937978	One game coming out in the entire world.
4937998	4940559	A game that I personally don't give a crap about is coming out on the 10th.
4940719	4941079	What's that?
4941419	4942860	That Gotham City Impostors...
4943479	4945581	What is your hatred for Gotham City Imposters?
4945661	4947763	It looked silly, silly cute.
4947823	4949745	That's kind of part of my problem.
4949885	4952427	It's like, it's a bunch of wannabes.
4952908	4953348	And you know what?
4953569	4956391	If I'm going to play a wannabe, I'll just play DC Universe Online.
4959434	4960515	I can't follow that.
4960595	4961316	I can't follow that.
4961821	4966003	DC Universe was definitely not wow.
4966103	4972226	DC Universe felt more like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the arcade game than it did wow.
4979770	4980811	I hate the controller so much.
4980851	4984153	And if you're not into that, then of course you're not going to be into DC Universe.
4984273	4985414	And I hate the camera.
4985674	4988316	But I thought PvP was a lot of fun in DC Universe.
4988956	4989416	I gotta say.
4989597	4991238	But you're not a player versus player kind of person.
4991438	4991918	No, I'm not.
4992438	4993359	I will dabble in it.
4993439	4994420	I'll experiment with PvP.
4994440	5000124	And to expand on my previous statement, and if I want to play a superhero game, I'll go back and play City of Heroes.
5001164	5001545	That's fair.
5001825	5007348	And if I want to play a game by that company, I'll just play Star Trek Online.
5008169	5009370	Which I'm going to once it's free.
5010030	5011472	Isn't that later this month?
5011692	5012112	Yes it is.
5013113	5020641	I've been reading on the Road to F2P blog that every time they do an expansion or something it's Road to whatever.
5021422	5026067	So now they've got number 25 of the Road to F2P expansion.
5028288	5030749	Blog going on, so I'm pretty excited.
5031009	5033950	Well, of course, you've ruffled the feathers of our chatroom, DarkSakura.
5034330	5035151	I don't give a shit.
5035991	5038932	Brad from PogCulture says, Oh, no, she didn't.
5039112	5039972	Oh, yes, I did.
5040712	5044254	Tigerclaw says, Gotham City Imposters looks amusing.
5044314	5048415	It looks like a bunch of people in bad cosplay costumes shooting at each other.
5048895	5050696	Yes, yes, yes.
5051256	5054437	And if I want bad cosplay, I'll go to Fonamay.
5055896	5057777	where there's occasionally some good cosplay.
5062520	5067742	Derek H has drawn a line in the sand and says City of Heroes is a lot crappier than DC Universe Online.
5067883	5068683	But it has better control.
5069583	5070144	And better camera.
5070304	5074206	Alan, you were a City of Heroes stand for quite some time.
5074226	5077808	I just played it for like 20 minutes just yesterday.
5078488	5079209	It's free to play now.
5079789	5083351	City of Heroes has a very strong RP community and it's still kicking.
5083411	5085172	So yeah, City of Heroes is...
5085812	5092815	But if you're not into RP, like, I don't know, when I listen to Dead Pixel Live and what I know of Derek H, he doesn't strike me as somebody that's really into RP.
5092835	5094596	I mean, he might.
5094656	5097817	It might be like a, you know, the secret lives of, you know, dot, dot, dot.
5097857	5099578	But I just don't get that.
5099838	5100978	That's why he plays games.
5100998	5107501	You know, my favorite thing to do, though, was in City of Heroes, make costumes, which is actually the same thing that the only thing I like doing in DC Universe.
5107541	5109522	So why aren't you playing Barbie, the game?
5111437	5112819	You should see how I play Sims.
5114141	5119590	I spend all my Sim game building the damn house and deciding what they're gonna look like.
5119750	5122073	That's what you fucking do in the Sims is you build a house.
5122214	5125338	But I don't do any of the get married and have babies shit.
5127131	5131274	If I do anything, it's go sit in the park and play guitar and get a lot of money and then go home.
5132355	5133736	Hack computer, go home.
5133976	5136058	You are living out your fantasies of being a bum.
5136299	5137800	That's what you're doing in The Sims.
5138040	5139902	You are living out your fantasies of being a bum.
5140522	5140822	No.
5142524	5143485	I can do that in real life.
5143545	5144285	I'm unemployed.
5147008	5147148	No.
5148709	5149030	All right.
5149050	5150171	Funemployed, funemployed.
5151071	5151452	DarkSakura.com
5171833	5178816	Well, the fandom community for those games is still going strong, and a group called... You forgot Quest for Glory.
5178836	5180257	Yeah, Quest for Glory came later.
5180477	5181658	Oh, judging you so hard right now.
5181678	5182518	I love that series, too.
5183478	5190742	Infamous-Adventures.com just released their HD fan community remake of Space Quest II.
5191742	5194744	VOHAL's Revenge, the original, came out in 1987.
5196825	5202648	Space Quest only had two games that were the really blocky 16-color EGA graphics.
5202708	5203489	Why are you smirking?
5203509	5204169	What do you want to say?
5204469	5205110	No, I'm looking at chat.
5205130	5205750	I'm not smirking at you.
5205770	5206330	I'm looking at chat.
5206350	5206711	I promise.
5209557	5234620	and then Space Quest 3, the Pirates of Pestilon had a graphical update or like it just it looked even though it was still text-based but yeah Space Quest 2 is probably the probably the best one of the whole franchise to be honest or at least before they went to point and click it took them five years to get this out there but yeah it looks like on the 30th of December just two days ago
5235580	5236361	It's final.
5236782	5243388	You can play Space Quest 2 with updated graphics due to the fans that go through and revamp this stuff.
5243468	5247031	I would really suggest if you are interested in this at all, you grab it now.
5247151	5247812	It's free, right?
5247952	5248132	Yeah.
5248272	5255739	You should probably grab it now because as soon as everybody gets back to work on Monday and the lawyers are back at work, there'll be a cease and desist letter.
5255839	5256359	Any predictions?
5256820	5257200	Tomorrow?
5257420	5257781	Tuesday?
5258461	5259462	Let's get cease and desisted?
5259582	5260403	What do you think?
5260483	5260963	I think by...
5262385	5263767	I think Monday 5 o'clock.
5263887	5273959	See, there's a different community that remade King's Quest 3 and I think 4, Perils of Rosella, which I think when I sat in for DarkSakura was my pick for classic game.
5274520	5275421	Those are still up there.
5276041	5276782	Those didn't get C&D'd.
5277523	5277863	Really?
5278204	5279885	Well, what about the whole Silver Lining thing?
5279945	5282907	That was a new property, I think is why.
5282967	5285369	Telltale Games is getting a new property.
5285409	5297839	Right, and at the time, we didn't know that King's Quest had been handed off and there's going to be a new one coming out from Telltale, and Silver Lining went through this whole ugly thing where it was like, yes, you can do the game as a fan game.
5298280	5299220	No, you can't do it at all.
5299440	5301842	Okay, yes, you can do it, but it can't say King's Quest on it.
5301922	5304725	I mean, finally it fucking came out, but...
5306558	5311390	I kind of look at what happened to the silver lining and I'm like, this is not going to last.
5312056	5317817	There are fan remakes of some of the original King's Quest games that I know are still out there that have been out for a year more.
5318097	5324599	Also, King's Quest is Roberta and Ken Williams and Space Quest is the two guys from Andromeda, Mark and Scott.
5324659	5326979	And Roberta don't give a fuck anymore.
5327339	5329160	She has said fuck off to the game industry.
5329180	5330820	She lives in a cabin in the Yosemite.
5330900	5335581	She has accomplished the American dream of living in a fort and get off her property.
5336741	5337381	Bless her heart.
5337782	5338042	But...
5340282	5341583	The fact that she did Kingsway.
5341623	5342583	Somebody else owns it now.
5342623	5343243	That's a prize.
5343323	5346324	Probably why she bought a fort.
5347445	5348185	And I'm not lying.
5348245	5354268	I believe that she does live in an outwood type of thing.
5354428	5356889	Yeah, but Space Quest 2 definitely improved on the first one.
5356929	5357809	It's hard as hell.
5358289	5359250	It's text-based.
5359550	5361711	Save often, because you will die.
5361971	5369134	And it's possible, like with some of the other Sierra games, to save your game past a point where you didn't pick up the item that you need.
5370234	5372155	to beat the puzzle and you literally have to start over.
5373296	5376838	And I just want to be clear when I joke about the whole cease and desist thing.
5376978	5379180	I don't want to see this thing get ceased and desisted.
5379380	5382482	I think this is a great, you know, imitation is the finest form of flattery.
5383102	5388005	And obviously people have very big spaces in their hearts for these types of games of yesteryear.
5388125	5391187	I will probably fucking download this and play it because I used to love these games.
5392707	5396848	I was more of a King's Quest person than a Space Quest, but nonetheless, I'll still play it and check it out.
5397289	5404851	But I also, unfortunately, am all too familiar with the business side of things and how these things tend to get shut down, so we'll see.
5404891	5413433	Well, just this last year, Streets of Rage got the Super Hela fan remake, and that was 1, 2, and 3, plus a bunch of extra fan-added crap.
5413873	5417234	That was up for a week before Sega was like, uh-uh, nope.
5417674	5419135	Take the hint, game companies.
5419475	5423779	I mean, I realize Telltale's like kind of trying to crank those out and that's kind of their niche now.
5423879	5426681	But, you know, they can't do everything.
5428942	5431244	So maybe people want to see a new game.
5431264	5431825	They can try.
5432605	5435627	It's Vivendi Activision that I think has the Sierra properties.
5435908	5439170	I will say I am stupid excited for a new King's Quest game from Telltale.
5439190	5439931	I think it's going to rock.
5439971	5440211	Yeah.
5440231	5443793	So I just, you know, please don't let me down with this Telltale.
5443833	5445895	Please, please don't let me down with it.
5446563	5449005	I have high hopes for that.
5449405	5452607	That's a series that has been gone from the gaming community far too long.
5452647	5453268	It's King's Quest.
5454128	5455690	These other games too.
5455750	5459232	King's Quest VIII, Mask of Eternity was a horrible nightmare and never really happened.
5460733	5463875	I would have moved into a fort too if I had put that game out.
5463895	5464396	That wasn't her.
5464976	5465456	I thought it was.
5466337	5469178	No, Mask of Eternity was developed by... She had nothing to do with King's Quest?
5469198	5471199	I thought she still kind of oversaw it.
5471499	5473400	Her name was just on it because she invented Graham.
5473420	5478723	The plot of it was about some knight arriving in Daventry and becoming king after King Graham.
5479603	5487346	But the whole style of it, because it was like ISO view 3D where you like... It was like an action game.
5487747	5489467	It was awful is what it was.
5490008	5491448	So yeah, no, that wasn't Roberta Williams.
5491908	5492989	All right.
5493479	5497602	I thought for some reason she had something to do with it, but maybe it's just because she invented King's Quest and all.
5498502	5499683	Anyhow, moving on.
5501124	5503386	Some stuff that is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5503446	5511351	Thanks to all these different ratings boards around the world, we know some of the games that will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade within the next year.
5511411	5512792	And there's some interesting things that are on here.
5513352	5537209	Uh, AMY, Babel Rising, Bang Bang Racing, Deep Black Episode 1 and 2, Defenders of Ardania, Dungeon Fighter Live, Happy Action Theater, Haunt, I Am Alive, uh, Nexuiz, Quarrel, Rayman 3, Hoodlum Havoc, Retro City Rampage, that's that Grand Theft Auto-y type game, uh, Saints Row Money Shot, a spin-off game that apparently-
5537769	5546153	From what I was reading about this game, it's some type of little mini game where you play the bullet and you try to go through as many things as possible as the bullet.
5546534	5548194	It sounds very over the top and very Saints Row.
5548895	5562882	Scary Girl, Shank 2, The Simpsons Arcade Game that had been leaked earlier, Sign Mora, Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Episode 2, Spelunky, Tetris Party Challenge, Warp, World Gone Sour, and Reketeer.
5563162	5567144	That is like a compilation of everything over the past few months that has been leaked and
5567384	5569206	from ratings boards and other websites.
5570207	5572148	That's what the roster will look like for 2012.
5572188	5575451	That's a good six months of releases right there, I'm sure.
5575992	5577593	So there you go.
5579335	5583839	All right, well, we've been talking a lot about classic games and indie games and so forth.
5584159	5586141	We need to take a step back in time.
5588376	5594337	to a simpler time when there was no DLC or patches for games.
5594417	5596238	If the game was broke, it was just broke.
5597538	5599138	DarkSakura's picked a broken game.
5599178	5599718	Just kidding.
5600178	5601779	It is a little broken sometimes.
5601919	5604339	DarkSakura's picked a mighty fine game as a classic game of the week.
5604379	5611701	And as I understand tonight, kind of a nod to, you know, I don't usually pick these kind of games, but dot, dot, dot, right?
5611921	5616182	Well, actually, it was one that I found myself enjoying quite a bit when it came out.
5616322	5616522	So...
5617382	5620266	This is going to be surprising to a lot of people, even though I've brought it up before.
5620966	5623689	And the game is WWF WrestleMania 2000 for Nintendo 64.
5628047	5630089	Yeah, I said it.
5630189	5631510	I picked it.
5631550	5634073	With its bad guitar synthesizer sound.
5635855	5638777	Basically, it came out in 1999.
5639278	5642060	It actually came out in 2000 in Japan for Nintendo 64.
5642821	5646345	It was based off of their annual pay-per-view event.
5647245	5652711	And honestly, this was when I was watching WWF regularly.
5653271	5655935	You know, during their whole attitude thing.
5656576	5662165	It was the NWO and... This was in China.
5662766	5663627	China, yeah.
5663728	5665050	Oh man, that one was a mess.
5667185	5668885	I was a big China fan at the time.
5669986	5681209	You know, back when everyone was laughing because Stephanie McMahon got boob implants, like, and you could totally tell the difference between one episode and the next.
5682469	5693372	And, you know, all the best divas coming out at the time, you still had Fabulous Moolah and what was her name?
5694592	5697073	Mae... Mae, what's her name?
5698814	5699274	Her buddy.
5700055	5702996	They were both fantastic wrestlers in their day.
5703176	5705417	You're asking the wrong people wrestling trivia.
5705777	5707398	Well, Mae Young.
5707598	5708018	Mae Young.
5709299	5710620	Who would threaten to show her puppies.
5711780	5715222	That was the best era of wrestling ever.
5715282	5720384	You had Test back in the day and you had the Hardy Boys and...
5724220	5725301	I can't remember his name either.
5725782	5726262	Kidman.
5727343	5728104	I remember his last name.
5728385	5730827	That was like the time that I would totally be into wrestling.
5730988	5733931	And Dan and I were both watching it and we loved it.
5733951	5738075	So when this game came out and everyone's like, this is the best wrestling game ever.
5738115	5738876	You gotta get it.
5738936	5739697	Guess who got it?
5740198	5740738	That was us.
5742560	5742761	So...
5745934	5750596	When it came out, it actually had this amazing story mode.
5750996	5754958	You had Royal Rumble, you had King of the Ring, you had the pay-per-views.
5755879	5763942	And the story modes were like watching the TV episodes, all the steroidal man drama you could handle.
5764242	5770585	Because honestly, I think that wrestling is soap operas for straight dudes.
5775833	5777134	Some of the chatters are chiming in.
5777494	5778974	We're a little bit delayed here.
5779415	5787157	Mae Young, Ivory, Tori, not Tori Wilson, Lita, Billy Kidman, Attitude Era, Reality Era.
5787898	5788398	Yeah.
5789398	5796061	And you also had a lot of stuff going on with Steve Austin, so there was that going on too.
5796081	5796341	Yeah.
5796721	5798683	I have never played this game, but I'm loving in the background.
5798723	5799583	I see some of the signs.
5799944	5801845	One of the signs says, China, suck it.
5803506	5804047	That's awesome.
5804427	5810571	I was hugely into WWF at the time, like all 80s kids were.
5810611	5815955	But there was a part where I think half of it was that I kind of grew out of it.
5815995	5819198	Because I remember it was Roddy Piper versus Hulk Hogan.
5819558	5820279	That was the big...
5821460	5844202	that was the big war of good and evil was Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan and then a lot of the major characters left and it was Stone Cold Steve Austin that brought it back from the doldrums because they had an icon again that they could you know he was awesome but by then I think I had outgrown it I remember playing some of the PS1 wrestling games that were good though
5844522	5845864	www.DarkSakura.com
5855504	5884913	who because what happens I think is that they save the same engine and use it for like whatever the fire pro wrestling and the various ones over there but it had all the signature moves and you could do custom stage entrance when you did the creative character so you could actually design everything that happened when they come out into the ring you could choose their starting music and it would actually have loops of some of the
5885573	5886495	Dan and I made this guy.
5899491	5901793	D-Generation X D-Generation X
5926210	5928213	and it was just so super fun.
5928233	5938207	It was a really fun game but like some of the characters in it you had the Road Warriors and Hulk Hogan and Taka Michinoku who was a legend in Japan.
5938267	5940470	He did not get enough nods over here.
5941932	5955001	You could actually create some of the WCW characters because I believe it was THQ, but they had the same... They had done the other games too.
5955461	5959504	So you could actually recreate Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall.
5959644	5961205	You could even make Macho Man.
5961225	5962926	Maybe...
5964213	5977872	There were... If you had two... If you were doing a tag team match and you actually picked people who were on the same team, it would, you know, have them be introduced under their team name instead of just their individual names.
5978753	5979254	You had...
5981310	5982031	All kinds of stuff.
5982051	5989954	I think you could also do Hell in a Cell and you could do... I don't think you could do... I don't remember if the Ladders, Tables, and Chairs matches were in it at the time.
5990194	5994036	But those were pretty fun too.
5994757	6000760	The commercials, I remember they were funny too because you had The Rock doing Christmas themed ads.
6000780	6001680	Yeah, Kane was in it.
6002800	6004021	And the Underfaker.
6004241	6005062	I mean, the Underbiker.
6005482	6006442	I mean, the Undertaker.
6006862	6007002	Yeah.
6008183	6009024	He's still around, right?
6009044	6010145	Yeah, he's still doing it.
6010205	6014468	I don't know why, because that man's had knee surgery and back surgery and everything else surgery.
6014868	6016249	You know what was the best about this?
6016669	6017750	It had mankind in it.
6019171	6019431	Oh, wow.
6019451	6019932	I remember him.
6021052	6021613	Mick Foley.
6021833	6022033	Yes.
6022253	6023014	And Mr. Socko.
6024605	6030248	He would put a dirty sock on his hand with a mouth drawn on it and shove it in people's mouths.
6030929	6032549	Oh, even I remember that.
6032569	6034030	That was awesome.
6034571	6035651	That man's insane.
6035831	6047878	I had to learn wrestling because one night... I know this was the doing of Travis and Jessica over at Under Station Live because we used to all do Rocky Horror in Sacramento together.
6047918	6049479	We did a wrestling night one night.
6049499	6053121	I don't know who suggested that was, but I somehow think Jessica was a part of it.
6053141	6053521	I don't know why.
6053741	6064928	I seem to remember she was heavily involved in that but I had to learn wrestling because I had to play one of the characters because we did we played wrestling people in Rocky Horror
6066861	6069102	That was the invention of the metal bull bra, wasn't it?
6069202	6069662	Yes, it was.
6069742	6073884	I was supposed to be Steve McMahon, the owner guy, as Riff Raff.
6073904	6074164	Vince.
6074705	6075005	Vince.
6075085	6075745	Vince McMahon.
6075765	6076705	I was Vince McMahon.
6077026	6077366	Yeah.
6077486	6078806	At least I didn't say Ed McMahon.
6079407	6081327	I was Vince McMahon as Riff Raff.
6081467	6082428	It was fun.
6082868	6086590	Because I had the sister or daughter or something that was Magenta.
6086610	6087490	Stephanie McMahon.
6087650	6088330	With the boobs.
6088651	6090792	And we were Riff Raff and Magenta in the movie.
6090992	6091372	Yeah.
6091932	6092573	That's pretty funny.
6092793	6094514	If you're into Rocky Horror, it was really funny.
6094594	6101219	Like, seriously, one of the most fun fucking shows we ever did because we actually had our own TLC match.
6101279	6102800	It was tables, ladders, and cookie sheets.
6104221	6104341	Ow.
6104582	6106103	I just hit my head on your counter.
6108124	6112708	I'm sitting in front of the bar and we had a fucking table and a ladder and a cookie sheet.
6114113	6114754	That's great.
6115454	6127964	You know, I miss the Deadly Boys, because they would actually set... They used to be in ECW, which was like the really hardcore wrestling association, and they would just set tables on fire and throw each other through it.
6128804	6129565	Anyway, anyway.
6130005	6130686	Sorry, back to games.
6130966	6132027	Anything else you want to say about this game?
6132967	6141270	You could get special copies that had a special hologram card with it that had different pictures of in-game action like an intro to a finish.
6142591	6149133	So, but I mean, it was just an awesome game and it had everything at the time that you would expect to see on TV.
6149213	6150934	And yeah, the music was kind of crap.
6152194	6153095	But who cares?
6153235	6153835	It was fun.
6154516	6158859	And like I said, Dan and I would spend hours making a character.
6159999	6162101	And then watch him play.
6162341	6163001	Just watch him play.
6163061	6167805	Like we had that one dude who was in purple and lime green who beat everybody.
6170046	6172127	And I think he had like Shawn Michaels hair.
6173768	6174389	So he had a mullet.
6176390	6176770	Alright.
6177131	6178652	Anything else to say about Rasslin'?
6179605	6181186	I missed when wrestling was good.
6181687	6182748	There it is.
6182768	6184309	Some of the chatters would say it's still good.
6185750	6187171	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6187272	6187472	Alan?
6187692	6190054	I was going to say you don't like John Cena.
6190534	6191435	The John Cena era.
6191495	6192236	I like John Cena.
6192556	6193777	I do like John Cena.
6193877	6197320	I have to say I like him because he doesn't look over-rewarded.
6198261	6199161	And he's actually good.
6199522	6202444	I liked The Rock because he wasn't acting then.
6205046	6206768	Quick, name a good movie with The Rock in it.
6207895	6208355	I can't do it.
6208515	6211277	Doom.
6211337	6213178	I was actually going to say The Mummy 2.
6214498	6217980	Because he was in it for five seconds and he was CG'd.
6218040	6219421	I did like Scorpion King for the rest of it.
6219441	6219641	We're done.
6219661	6221582	That's Classic Game of the Week.
6223743	6224883	That man looks good in tight pants.
6225243	6226004	WWF.
6226444	6228305	Yes, because it was the WWF back then.
6228345	6230306	WrestleMania 2000 on the Nintendo 64.
6230346	6231226	Screw those pandas.
6233653	6235074	Alright, we're going to take a break.
6235174	6244202	When we come back, we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the all-important, the moment you've been waiting for all night, I'm sure, Game of the Year 2011 discussion.
6244402	6245623	I don't know what DarkSakura's going to pick.
6245683	6246624	I don't know what Alan's going to pick.
6247025	6248806	They don't know what I'm going to pick.
6248846	6250467	Alan thinks he knows, but maybe I changed my mind.
6251408	6253290	I'm worried at least one or two of ours will be the same.
6253730	6254211	Well, we'll see.
6254271	6256993	It's okay because, you know, there is no right or wrong answer.
6257433	6258874	Also, your picks for Game of the Week.
6258894	6264259	We're going to come up with the OLR Game of the Year for 2011 all when we come back.
6264619	6265300	You might be surprised.
6265640	6265960	We'll see.
6266561	6267281	Or you might not be.
6267581	6268002	We'll see.
6268382	6271264	So we'll be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6271444	6271905	Stay tuned.
6278243	6280704	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6280764	6283685	We are live on this 1st of January.
6283765	6290166	Happy New Year 2012 with the 440th episode of our show from the new studio setup.
6290246	6294648	Although, if everything's been done right, you shouldn't really be able to tell at all that it's a new setup.
6295508	6299809	Rob Roberts, of course, here with you with DarkSakura and Alan tonight filling in for Loki.
6300174	6300714	It occurred to me.
6301034	6305276	I realize why we have less background noise and extra reverberation.
6305497	6305837	What's that?
6306037	6306497	Carpet.
6307297	6311079	Yeah, that's a big part of it is that you don't have the sound bouncing everywhere.
6312820	6314441	The way it's partitioned is differently too.
6314481	6315901	It's just setups are going to be weird.
6317582	6342258	Anyhow, Loki, of course, will be back next week I don't want anyone thinking funny business is going on But it is technically a holiday And he, like many other people, has to go back to work tomorrow So I think there's a dinner thingy going on tonight that he's at So he'll be back next week to talk Game of the Year with us But the three of us that are here tonight will get into our Game of the Year picks here shortly But first, we've got to talk about some rapid-fire news So, Alan, since you're filling in for Loki tonight, why don't you start us off?
6345000	6351117	By the way, it was a slow news week, so there's kind of some less stories than we usually have, just so you know.
6351878	6359543	There is an MMO coming out in China, I believe, called The Age of Wulin.
6360243	6372390	And a certain gentleman who wants to play this game very much went to an auction being held by the developers, Snail Games, and basically he bought an online item for his character.
6372510	6376332	Once this game comes out, he's going to have some epic god-tier sword.
6377313	6384358	for his character that he spent US dollar equivalent $16,000 for.
6385639	6394085	For a weapon for his toon in a game that no one knows if it's even a good game or not.
6394165	6400469	Now, looking at the screenshot, and I think this is the official Age of Woolen trailer, it's on YouTube.
6401411	6402132	It looks pretty.
6402892	6407795	So Vish, I mean, obviously it's not some back alley studio that is making an ugly game.
6407815	6408255	It looks pretty.
6408275	6410997	But yeah, $16,000 for an epic item.
6411137	6417761	Also at this auction, they sold a sheath, meaning not a weapon.
6417841	6422543	It's the thing that you put your weapon in for your character for the Hook of Departure for $1,600.
6424104	6426646	And another sheath for the Lordly Spear.
6429247	6429467	for $2,500.
6429967	6435531	Does he get his name in the game or any special thing for spending this much money?
6435731	6437052	I mean, I don't know.
6437272	6447799	I've heard of people spending a lot of money on an eBay auction because they can win a role in the game or the money goes to charity or something, but this doesn't appear to be the case, does it?
6447839	6453723	It sounds like... I would hope that this item would be bound to his account so whatever character he rolls can use it.
6453783	6456105	Maybe he'll be able to kick everyone's ass in PvP.
6456385	6457786	I don't really know enough about the game.
6458486	6460447	to know what this is going to do for him.
6460627	6473615	But it looks like he received a commemorative plaque with his name engraved on it by Snail Games saying, you know, thou own this sword and you're awesome because you gave us 16 grand for it.
6474315	6475496	And it's a one-of-a-kind item.
6475616	6482900	So the graphic, I guess, of visually the texture of how the sword looks and its name and its stats, he's the only one in the whole system that's going to have it.
6483541	6485242	So his EP will be even bigger.
6485382	6485562	Yes.
6486997	6487478	You know what?
6487638	6491502	When I would do stuff like that for my private servers on Ragnarok Online, I would pay $5.
6496178	6523095	when I was into City of Heroes I would buy their costume packs which was about three to six bucks for like mutant because you know when City of Heroes like DarkSakura was saying there are millions of combinations of costumes for your character some of them were DLC so I've spent money I've race changed I've race changed my Bane and WoW I'm just not going to spend what you could buy a automobile for
6524216	6525217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6554054	6562840	I hope Star Wars does legitimately, you know, even though I say two games can coexist, I do hope the two games can kind of tug and pull from each other a little bit.
6563320	6564381	It'll help us all in the long run.
6564801	6568443	And for the record, all the cryptic points, I did a lot of that in Star Trek Online.
6569064	6571225	So that's why I have a defiant retrofit.
6572907	6588341	and it looks like this game in China is entering open beta this spring I should sign up for it and it looks like we are getting it here in the US but it still needs to be put through open beta in China so I don't think there's really a due date on when we're going to get it here soon
6588721	6590242	I played Ragnarok Online in Korean.
6591522	6592983	So did I. I remember that.
6593383	6595024	I was like, Jamie, what do I do here?
6595464	6596685	Jamie, what do I do here?
6596925	6599106	You played with me on the American one.
6599346	6600167	On the American beta.
6600607	6603768	I remember a translation patch for the Korean.
6604089	6607150	There was a translation patch because some of the NPCs were still in Korean.
6608951	6609271	Okay.
6609871	6611152	Then alright, I played that one.
6611652	6613053	But I played the Korean one before that.
6614065	6616626	Whatever, it wasn't that great.
6616686	6617306	It was fun.
6617486	6627848	And this article does make a brief mention of the wank over Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, which of course was the game that came out before Skyrim, which is making a lot of game of the year lists right now.
6628208	6634590	Because Oblivion had DLC where you could make pretty armor for your horse that literally did nothing.
6634670	6635250	It was just...
6636010	6661754	you know metal for your horse I kind of think the gaming community just needs to let that go like I understand that that is the quintessential like thing that people will point out for DLC but also at the same time Bethesda has come out the industry has learned from that mistake though that we will not do that again that was you know you know what nobody was fucking doing it then and we did it and we learned you know so okay kind of a break yeah anyhow what else you have for us
6664396	6665216	What do I have for you?
6665516	6665836	Hold on.
6668117	6673358	Pirated games via torrents or Usenet or whatever.
6674038	6678599	The Torrent Freak, which is a big torrent, sort of underground torrent news site.
6678639	6687141	If a torrent site gets raided, like the Pirate Bay, if they ever get raided, Torrent Freak is usually the site that reports on it, you know, like journalistically.
6687721	6693502	They have compiled lists of the top pirated games via piracy.
6695283	6697624	by digital torrent download.
6699305	6706889	For PC, we've got Crysis 2, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, no surprise there, would have been probably number one if it came out earlier in the year.
6708110	6710111	Top Wii game downloads, Galaxy 2.
6711752	6717135	Mario Sports Mix, surprisingly, and Xenoblade Chronicles, which is... What the hell is... Oh, Super Mario Galaxy 2.
6717175	6719116	Yeah, sorry, Super Mario Galaxy 2.
6719597	6720477	Mario Sports Mix.
6720918	6739990	And number three is interesting, Xenoblade Chronicles, which you would think would be a no-one-curr game, but it's an issue of... It was translated in English for the Europe market, and according to this, the tally, 950,000 confirmed downloads via the various torrents that you could get this game on.
6741430	6750192	and that's a thing where if Nintendo didn't have their head up their ass and put that out here then maybe that number... But they are going to put it out here, Alan.
6750212	6751392	Yeah, too little too late.
6751572	6763914	Everyone here who wanted it either bought it and paid the 90 bucks to import it for their modded Wii from London or wherever their UK retailer is or they pirated it.
6765375	6766715	And of course Modern Warfare 3...
6768983	6777086	Access isn't a problem there because it's, you know, America is the biggest market for that game and it's just people don't want to pay 60 bucks for it.
6777366	6779447	So sometimes it's just an issue of people being cheap.
6780807	6781107	All right.
6781167	6788090	But yeah, and then top 360 pirated downloads via BitTorrent, Gears of War 3, no surprise there.
6788650	6791311	And then of course, number two, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
6792171	6794992	So all the, mostly the big multiplayer games.
6795813	6796133	All right.
6797375	6798235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6816524	6818086	We've talked about it here on this show before.
6818146	6820528	Obviously, we don't support it either here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6821429	6823871	And it seems like the number of people that are supporting it are dropping.
6824131	6826253	Obviously, I don't think I need to touch on it here.
6826273	6827934	It doesn't really directly relate to video games.
6828254	6831477	But I'm sure you've all heard about what GoDaddy's been going through with this whole thing.
6831537	6839364	And obviously, they had quite a number of embarrassing PR stumbles where I think you were hearing the Benny Hill theme playing in the background with every press release.
6839924	6846769	Well, the good news is that Nintendo, Sony, and EA have all as well dropped SOPA support.
6847449	6853553	An update to the government's list of SOPA supporters show that the names are now no longer on there.
6853994	6856375	Of course, there is no word as to why.
6857076	6869324	Is it because they saw the tech community backlash to what happened to GoDaddy, or maybe that whole debacle made them rethink the position, or maybe they just realized finally it was not a good idea?
6870944	6877426	For whatever the reason, it's a relief to see these gaming companies are finally dropping out and taking their names off the list.
6877846	6878247	Hooray!
6879607	6881808	Some more rumors are floating around about Epic Mickey 2.
6882628	6890110	Now, you might remember there was an earlier rumor based on a survey that had been out there, some type of focus group thing that had people choosing the box art.
6890490	6896432	Well, the rumors are circulating again this week because I guess there was an online newsletter that Disney put out that just flat out said,
6896992	6902016	Epic Mickey 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii in fall of 2012.
6903557	6913784	You might remember the original Epic Mickey game was a Wii exclusive, but maybe because of that or what, it didn't sell maybe as much as it could have.
6914184	6917586	And so it's kind of interesting in a way that it is getting a sequel after all.
6918267	6925332	Supposedly the sequel, Epic Mickey 2, will also have co-op play, including two-player split-screen, which is something we don't see in games all the time anymore.
6925752	6926092	DarkSakura
6951775	6955676	Well, in other news, there's a fun little game that I just purchased today called Bastion.
6956697	6961278	And apparently other people have decided to buy it as well because it exceeded $500,000.
6962219	6964259	And that's an indie game.
6964439	6968381	So, I mean, it's really catching on, don't you think?
6969641	6973743	At any rate, that's with Steam and Xbox Live Arcade sales.
6974323	6975883	And my apologies, I didn't mean dollars.
6975923	6977104	That's 500,000 copies sold.
6977124	6977504	My apologies.
6981446	6982406	So yeah, good game.
6982866	6984207	And a lot of people think so.
6984347	6987789	To be honest, with some of the deals on Steam and so forth, I'm surprised it's not higher.
6988089	6988949	It's a quality game.
6989029	6992451	Well, it's, you know, the story is also like from what, a couple days ago?
6992791	6994932	So maybe, who knows, who knows.
6995712	6997193	And it just exceeded that, so.
6998234	7002576	And also, a really, really hard NES game has been translated into English.
7003396	7005017	And it's called Takeshi's Challenge.
7005717	7009499	And to quote the article here, the game was made by the devil.
7011932	7034155	one of the Ram modders King Mike has translated it into English so you can play it is it like Beat Takeshi the guy that was in Battle Royale I want to think so actually I'm pretty sure that it is but I can find out I am though very sure that it is from Beat Takeshi very cool
7034902	7038906	and he has the show that's been ripped off here as Wipeout, right?
7041388	7045272	Takeshi's Castle and they had the dubs that were on here in the States.
7045352	7045913	Wasn't that a thing?
7045933	7047334	Isn't that still on?
7047895	7053480	Yeah, it was Takeshi's Castle and it was the ultimate challenge, blah, blah.
7053580	7055261	Yes, exactly.
7056563	7056883	All right.
7057263	7057564	Hold on.
7058244	7058424	What?
7060047	7066538	Yeah, Takeshi no Chosenjo And it is Beat Takeshi Takeshi Kitano Nice
7068553	7073776	All right, well, before we get into some more news, the time has come for you to lip sync.
7074317	7074797	No, just kidding.
7075077	7078019	For us to talk about the Game of the Year of 2011.
7078919	7083502	And we're going to go around the table and see what we here at OLR thought was the Game of the Year.
7083542	7084843	We want to start with the community.
7084963	7086764	Obviously, it's a show where every gamer has a voice.
7087205	7093969	And earlier this week on Facebook and Google+, in our communities there, we asked you guys, what do you think is the Game of the Year?
7094589	7114154	and I wanted to make sure this is important you guys understand there's no right or wrong answer the whole point of the show here is that it's where every gamer has a voice and everybody's into something different people can only afford sometimes to buy the games that were from last year or you know not everybody is necessarily into RPGs or shooters or racers
7114514	7128821	So I think this is important to really just kind of open it up to actual gamers that are enthusiastic enough to be listening to a podcast and fan their page, yet may not necessarily find the same critical darlings to be as successful.
7128941	7130022	Or maybe they did.
7130122	7134364	I mean, sometimes what the critics pick really is the cream of the crop.
7134624	7135124	So let's see.
7135204	7138406	Let's start with the community first and see what some of you guys out there said.
7139406	7142790	was the absolute bestest game to come out in 2011.
7143030	7144171	Or I'm sorry, that you played in 2011.
7144411	7147294	It may have been a game that actually came out previously.
7147314	7154642	Because, you know, God, there'll probably be some games I don't get to play until 2012 because 2011 was so crowded with so many good releases.
7155843	7157145	Can I also start off by saying
7158206	7158727	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7175942	7179505	I don't remember looking back at last year going, this was the best year ever for games.
7179865	7182668	But this year was really, really, really good.
7183148	7184790	All right, here's some of what you guys picked.
7185130	7190114	Over on Facebook, Zether said, number three, Mario Kart 7, the best one.
7190414	7194818	Number two, Saints Row the Third, wacky, insane, better than Grand Theft Auto 4 in every way.
7195239	7200183	And his number one game of the year is Portal 2, an excellent follow-up with a very good single-player campaign and solid co-op.
7201364	7226382	John Keegan said I shouldn't say the full last name sorry John K said over on Facebook best 2011 game Arkham City based on the variety of missions and improvement on an already awesome original otherwise I played older games in 2011 of which Assassin's Creed 2 and Uncharted 2 topped the charts based on awesome story and solid gameplay Derek W said
7227683	7230144	said Resident Evil 4 HD.
7231104	7232865	Kind of a remake of an older game.
7234485	7237086	Great injection to a boring year of military shooters.
7237166	7237746	Looks beautiful.
7238406	7240487	Fallout New Vegas download content.
7240527	7243688	The most rewarding and content-heavy DLC seen yet.
7243788	7245508	And number one, Skyrim.
7245929	7246629	Fus Ro Dah.
7248871	7262867	Tom S said Skyrim Skyward Sword and Saints Row 3 didn't really give reasons but those are the top three Mike B said Gears of War 3 very well done kind of like a masterpiece of sci-fi shooters let me think about the other two time's up
7264508	7271051	Johnny R says, number three, Alice Madness Returns, beautifully haunting sequel to one of my most beloved games as a child.
7271491	7275112	Number two, Catherine, excellent puzzle game with a rad story to go with it.
7275192	7280114	Number one, Mortal Kombat, great fighting game that stepped it up with an amazing story mode.
7281194	7283215	Oh, Mike B did come up and say Saints Row 2.
7284035	7285636	Yes, two, not three.
7285776	7286776	I just discovered it in 2011.
7289318	7293701	Kashuniko, or sorry, Kashuiko Janai, I think it's DJ Janai.
7293721	7294282	Katsuhiko.
7294562	7298605	Yeah, says number three, Super Mario Land 3D.
7299585	7300967	I didn't watch a lot of El Hazard, did I?
7301127	7304349	A great blend of traditional Mario and new Mario styles.
7305050	7306931	If only Sonic could achieve this feat.
7307131	7307591	Oh, snap.
7308092	7309373	Number two, Portal 2.
7309613	7311414	Funny story, great puzzles, awesome acting.
7311775	7313035	Number one, Minecraft.
7313476	7316998	The ultimate never-ending sandbox of building ADD insanity.
7317219	7317459	OMG.
7319475	7324178	Joe R said, number three, DDRX3 versus DDR Second Mix.
7324358	7326039	Still some love for the Bomani games.
7326499	7330622	Well, it was either this or DDR2, and I noticed they still couldn't get the interface quite right.
7331422	7333363	Number two, La Mulana on the Wii.
7333784	7334684	No surprise there.
7335244	7337146	I think I'm more surprised that it's not number one.
7337866	7342028	He says, take what made Cade's story so great, but throw in some extra block and switch puzzles.
7342209	7344190	Also recently announced that a PC port will come to Steam.
7345317	7347839	Number one, The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.
7348880	7352062	I'm digging up this one a lot more than Twilight Princess.
7352182	7355004	Great game, expecting to sink at least 30 hours in before I'm done.
7355644	7358666	Bradley B said, number three, Chime Super Deluxe.
7359247	7365271	Adds four good to great songs to the roster and adds perfect quads and changing layouts to further add to the gameplay.
7365631	7368052	Number two, Portal 1, or excuse me, Portal 2.
7368433	7368633	Oops.
7369073	7369934	Number two is Portal 2.
7370374	7374356	All around fun and adds so many more hilarious quotable quotes to the Portal universe.
7374756	7376117	Number one, Bastion.
7376518	7379579	The narration makes what would be a pretty good action game a great one.
7379920	7382741	The narration adds a story that is full and vibrant and memorable.
7385183	7388746	Miguel I says, Portal 2, best sequel ever.
7389767	7391969	Forza 4, best driving game to date.
7392150	7394792	A great combination of arcade and simulation type racing.
7395072	7399036	And Sequence, DDR and RPG combined into a really fun and addicting game.
7399576	7405362	Jim H says, Infamous 2 improves on everything from the first game and the user generated content was a great addition.
7405982	7407544	Number two, LittleBigPlanet 2 improves
7407984	7412587	Any other year, the sequel to one of my all-time favorite games that improves on the original would be my number one.
7413267	7414668	And number one was Portal 2.
7415629	7418450	He picked all twos for his top list.
7418750	7423653	Sticking with the theme, it's an improvement on the original, has some of the best storytelling and voice acting in gaming history.
7424114	7426475	Add in the great gameplay, and it makes it the game of the year.
7427616	7431238	Let me quickly run over to Google+, because we had a few responses over there as well.
7431898	7446883	I wanted to read for you guys and we had from DeadPixelLive commented F1 2011 Forza 4 and Pinball FX 2 F1 2011 because it did what a sports sequel is supposed to do leave the good stuff in and add more good stuff
7447583	7456255	Forza 4 because the rival mode made driving and competing fun, and Pinball FX 2 because at the end of the year I realized I had played it more than all my other games.
7456896	7457296	Good reason.
7458658	7459780	We have another response here.
7459880	7463244	It's written in Russian, so I'm not sure how to say this, so I apologize.
7463685	7464726	DarkSakura, do you read Russian?
7465647	7465907	No.
7466288	7469129	Okay, so just pipe it through Google Translate.
7470290	7472071	So, unfortunately, name I can't read.
7472171	7472571	Sorry.
7473012	7473832	Ignorant American.
7474873	7480036	Says, number one, Deus Ex, Human Revolution for a great cyberpunk story and enjoyable gameplay.
7480896	7481757	Too bad Extro is not here.
7481797	7482617	Extro can read Russian.
7483018	7484118	Little known fact about Extro.
7484218	7485199	I remember when he was learning.
7485219	7486120	Yeah, I remember that, too.
7486140	7486560	Thanks to Nelly.
7487280	7488261	Number two, Bastion.
7488301	7490342	Yeah, because Loki's wife is Russian.
7490442	7494445	And I remembered all of the cards all over your apartment, and I almost learned to read Russian, too.
7495525	7497446	You'd think I'd know more after living there.
7498186	7502767	Anyhow, number two, Bastion for very polished representation, great music, and awesome narration.
7503108	7509369	And number three, The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings for old school hardcore RPG brought up to the next level on every aspect.
7510090	7515411	Lastly, Wendy S says, number three, Battlefield 3, favorite shooter, love the way they did multiplayer.
7515731	7516632	Number two, NHL 12...
7517552	7518492	Favorite sports game?
7518592	7520873	Realistic simulation of hockey but not inaccessible.
7520973	7525995	And number one, Portal 2 drew me in like nothing else could.
7526035	7528996	So those are some of the responses from Facebook and Google+.
7529636	7530376	Very diverse.
7530416	7532537	Did you guys catch that?
7532777	7535898	Yes, but I put a game on my list that they didn't.
7536198	7537078	Interesting.
7537219	7540000	So we're about to get to that here in a minute.
7540100	7542661	I wanted to quickly see if I could bring this up.
7544422	7557868	I forgot to put it in the link or in the show role because over on NeoGAF, there's a thread where they're actually tracking what the media, all the different gaming outlets are naming as the game of the year.
7557888	7559288	So I kind of wanted to give you an idea.
7560669	7577514	What they were saying, kind of what the rest of the internet is saying, or what the critics are saying and so forth Let's see, I'll have to try and dig for this a little bit here Any games that the chatters mentioned that you were like, oh I forgot about that game
7578519	7579701	Um, no.
7580982	7582724	Because they all like Angry Birds, apparently.
7583325	7585127	I don't think anybody said Angry Birds, actually.
7585407	7585988	Alright, here we go.
7586048	7586488	I found it.
7586809	7587870	So this is from NeoGaf.
7587890	7590513	Thank you to the folks over there that tallied this all together.
7590653	7591794	Poster was Cheesemeister.
7593176	7594718	Has tallied up what the media.
7595819	7597421	72 different outlets has picked Skyrim.
7598222	7599103	And that's the number one.
7600104	7616584	22 outlets have picked Portal 2, 17 have picked Batman Arkham City, 7 for Zelda Skyward Sword, 7 for Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception, no listener put Uncharted 3, very interesting, 4 said Gears of War 3, 2 said Bastion, 2 said Catherine, 2 said Dark Souls
7617506	7620390	Two said Deus Ex Human Resolution Two said L.A.
7620450	7632446	Noire Again, surprised I didn't hear that from any of the chatters either Two said Star Wars The Old Republic Two said Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP and a handful of other games got a mention as well So
7634207	7635829	Who cares about what the media thinks?
7636851	7638072	Let's talk about what we think.
7649247	7650608	Skyrim Why did you pick Skyrim?
7676025	7693329	it tries to do something that a lot of game developers are afraid to do Bethesda rather the makers of Skyrim ever since the original two Elder Scrolls games which most people haven't played Arena and I'm blanking on what the second one was
7696111	7710307	they're sandbox games before Grand Theft Auto which is where that genre and that term sandbox game came from so you can literally do anything if you want to make a plate wearing warrior who casts
7711968	7739179	you can go exploring for hours ignore the main plot completely and still have stuff to do Bethesda with Morrowind and Oblivion and now Skyrim that's always been their thing to make this really immersive almost impossible to complete game and Skyrim is the best attempt at it yet where even I know people in real life that have played Morrowind and Oblivion and it was such a burden all this openness
7740459	7766000	they hated it and Skyrim there's something about it where they get better each time in streamlining that combination of keeping your attention plus holy shit this is a whole huge world to dink around in visually it is gorgeous it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played especially on my PC which is now four years old and yeah it's for a for you know kind of a
7768567	7774884	I get really into exploration and min-maxing stats and doing crafting and Skyrim has all of that.
7774944	7776108	It's a great game.
7776593	7783861	Now, is it just me, or for a game as vast as Skyrim, we really need a new fucking mem besides this arrow to the knee shit?
7785362	7796353	I didn't get that until I finally was in a town, and I heard some dude, I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee, and I was like, oh, thank you, it's something that some dude says to you.
7796453	7797775	Now I finally get that man.
7797795	7798496	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7799096	7828560	yeah it was from the game but it's like with a game so fucking huge like seriously there has to be something else the 50,000 cheese wheels off the mountain was funnier than an arrow to the knee I'm sorry there's a great picture of the the um the aural of Whiterun the first king that you meet where someone had stacked hundreds of like carrots apples cabbages all over him and they took a picture and he's got his chin on his fist like a thinking man on his throne being all kingly and he's just surrounded by like cabbages it's awesome
7829855	7830115	All right.
7830856	7833737	DarkSakura, what is your number three pick for Game of the Year?
7834777	7835618	Batman Arkham City.
7836258	7837039	Batman Arkham City.
7837099	7838299	Why did you pick Batman Arkham City?
7838819	7843782	Because, and I honestly didn't play it, but I watched Dan play it most of the time.
7844122	7845723	And I just sit back and it's like watching a movie.
7846043	7846263	Really?
7846603	7849345	It's what happens when you're married or in a committed relationship.
7849385	7851085	Sometimes you let the other person do the driving.
7851165	7851446	I get it.
7851486	7855268	Yeah, well, we've done that for tons of games between the two of us.
7855368	7859650	So, you know, I just sit back and I totally dig the character designs.
7860330	7862671	I love that they got Penguin right.
7863372	7866213	That he's this British gangster kind of guy, you know.
7867354	7869975	And Catwoman was absolute hotness.
7871015	7875838	Except it is physically impossible to leap around like you do in four-inch heels, just saying.
7877344	7879166	Mark Hamill's last performance as Joker.
7895362	7895642	Maybe.
7895903	7896743	No, officially.
7897784	7906813	Yeah, but then they went and teased Arkham World and you're like... He said on Twitter that he would come back specifically for a Killing Joke animated special.
7906933	7910337	But yeah, it's interesting.
7910617	7911858	Throw enough money at him, he'll do it.
7912058	7912919	No, I don't think so.
7912979	7914661	Get him better seats at the VGAs next year.
7915406	7943449	but that was just like a fantastic performance and I really liked their Harley too especially you find the little Easter egg and oops spoilers oops you find a positive pregnancy test in their little love nest and then in one of the endings she's singing to her baby so it's just lots of neat little things thrown about in there and the whole business with Hush that was pretty cool because that was actually the last Batman thing I ever read was Heart of Hush
7945250	7948072	I was not a big DC person but that was a really good storyline.
7948472	7949573	So yeah, it was really cool.
7949913	7954896	It had lots of nods to just all kinds of different characters and it was really neat.
7956357	7960440	And also, as a designer, love the design in the game.
7961041	7961501	It's beautiful.
7963414	7980790	for me I just have to start off by saying this has been extraordinarily hard this year there have been so many not just good but fucking phenomenal games this year that I have like I told Alan like three days ago what my list was going to be and I've changed it since then I've changed it several times since then and even now in my head I'm like
7981511	7983734	Do I really want to say this as number three?
7983774	7986277	Or do I want to put this game in there because this game was so fucking good?
7987398	7990482	But I'm going to just commit to what I'm going to say here.
7990602	7996188	And I really think, you know, I kind of look back at fun and what game did I really enjoy.
7997430	7999412	I think my number three game of the year is...
8000633	8025020	Super Mario 3D Land on the 3DS because you know and I said this on the show when I first reviewed it I really think it is the greatest Mario game they have done since the Super Nintendo one I think it's just the 3D works it makes you understand why a 3DS you know can can work it's one of those games where you keep peeling back the layers and even though it seems like god this game is easy as cake it's
8025320	8025901	in the beginning.
8026241	8029105	It just gets crazier and crazier as you move on.
8029665	8033810	It has a lot of the retro stuff that, you know, we love retro games here at OLR that we love.
8034290	8040938	It's such a worthy reason to own a 3DS, and I think that Mario 3D Land is my number three pick for Game of the Year.
8041278	8049580	I think it might very well be the only 3DS game right now where the 3D is more than just, oh, that looks neat.
8050160	8050540	Cool.
8051120	8052060	It's in 3D.
8052640	8059882	When you play Super Mario 3D Land, the 3D is an integral part of the gameplay and the experience.
8060222	8063283	And turning that little notch down on the side...
8064503	8066484	Like, it damages the game.
8066684	8070726	And I love that you can invert the 3D, too.
8070946	8073407	Like, it's hard to explain unless you do it, but it's very easy.
8073427	8076328	You have it pop out or be recessed inwards, but it's still 3D.
8076528	8077028	It's great.
8077628	8085712	And I gotta remind you guys, I think, still to this day, that Mario 64 was quite a bit overrated because of a lot of its move to 3D.
8086232	8088873	Yet, I love what 3D has done to Mario here.
8090514	8092094	I look at myself and I can't justify it.
8092414	8093915	Like, it just works.
8095737	8104373	and that's why I think it's one of the greatest games to come out this year absolutely Salacious Pop or Alan your number two pick
8106380	8115890	Probably going to say Dragon Age Origins since you said this could be games that we played in this year rather than came out.
8116931	8127001	One of the reasons why I'm going back to a game from 2009 is that a lot of the big A-list games that came out like Deus Ex, I haven't played them so I don't want to talk out of my ass and hype up a game I've never played.
8129303	8150564	um Bioware ever since you know the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG has shown that they are one of the best narrative and character writers in the industry um I would say even better than Blizzard and Valve and the twists and the care like Alistair and Morrigan who's he's the um
8151124	8155325	Other Grey Warden and Morrigan is the Witch of the Wild are the first two NPCs you pick up.
8155825	8170467	They are so engaging and I was fascinated with each of them for completely different reasons and they were acted and written so well and I was very invested in how I manipulated the game to make sure that I got endings that were right for them.
8171968	8179029	Origins is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and a lot of the D&D engine based games that Bioware wrote in the 90s.
8180349	8195966	and Dragon Age 2 if you play it which I believe that came out earlier this year the menu and the UI it's all very new school I'm not saying Dragon Age 2 is a bad game but you can tell right away even just by the menus that it's a different origins really harkens back to
8197601	8201262	The 90s experience for me, but with a present day game or story.
8201602	8208383	Alright, so even though you went with a game that's a couple years old, you can do that because this is your picks for best game of 2011 and sometimes you don't discover the games until later.
8208623	8213584	So for anyone who overlooked Origins, yeah, it's still relevant.
8213805	8214085	Play it.
8214445	8215145	Alright, fair enough.
8215585	8218045	DarkSakura, your number two pick.
8218426	8222406	Ultimate Marvel vs. Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
8223487	8224227	Galactus Flick.
8224547	8224867	Fling!
8226024	8234388	Making My Hand Hurt, Awesome Cast, Firebrand, but I still go back and play Phoenix more than anything.
8235129	8236649	It's just fun.
8237350	8240811	And She-Hulk, of course, because She-Hulk is hardcore.
8241672	8243493	But yeah, it's just a fun fighting game.
8243973	8251557	It brought out all the DLC characters, plus more characters that people wanted to see, except for no freaking Mega Man.
8252537	8254138	But other than that, perfect.
8255578	8256839	Fighting Game Perfection.
8257219	8262641	Didn't bother you that it was only six months after the other Marvel vs. Capcom that also came out this year?
8262861	8263081	No.
8266023	8266383	Not really.
8266903	8268044	I didn't buy any of the DLC.
8269304	8269844	Well, there you go.
8270285	8273366	And, you know, the tweaks in the gameplay actually made it worth it.
8273746	8274827	It felt different enough.
8275567	8275827	Alright.
8277124	8278365	My number two game of the year.
8278965	8283968	It's one that's already been named, but I think it's a game absolutely worthy of the list.
8284168	8288610	I never expected to enjoy Batman Arkham City as much as I did.
8289170	8293612	I like Batman all the way back to the Adam West Batman.
8294193	8296794	I admit I'm not as into reading the comics.
8296954	8299055	I'm not as into the animated series.
8299275	8300536	I watched it a little bit when I was a kid.
8301036	8304138	So I don't know the Mark Hamill Joker.
8304198	8307159	I don't know the characterizations of these characters as much as some of y'all do.
8307699	8310901	But I'll be damned if I didn't just love this game.
8311121	8313242	I mean, it's just the story in it is outstanding.
8313622	8318345	The way they juggle all of the villains without making it seem like cheesy or over the top is great.
8318765	8320326	I love the exploration.
8320406	8322567	Love, love, love the Grand Theft...
8323027	8352249	Batman style thing that they have going on I think the DLC is done rather tastefully the way you can have I mean the whole Catwoman debacle outside where some people didn't have their codes the stuff they kind of been doing beyond that like the Nightwing and everything I think is neat expansions to the game I love the side missions it's a rewarding experience and it's the total package when it comes to a video game absolutely is I have to ask you did you do the bit where Catwoman abandons Batman
8354218	8354478	Yes.
8355058	8355558	Isn't it great?
8355658	8355898	Yes.
8357059	8357539	Screw him.
8359459	8360400	She's such a bitch.
8361160	8365581	Yeah, no, the way that I mean, just the way the characters are done alone, it makes the game outstanding.
8365621	8371163	But just it's just I think you said it well when you said you didn't even play it.
8371543	8372683	And it was like watching a movie.
8372883	8373783	And that's how good it is.
8374463	8379985	I mean, and then to even take it a step further and actually kind of like get your hands on it and be in control is just outstanding.
8380640	8382361	I did actually play a little bit of it.
8382481	8386963	I mean, I'm not going to say I didn't play any of it, but it was Dan's save.
8387023	8389444	And since I'd seen so much of it, I was like, there's no point.
8390224	8391665	But I might go back and do it myself now.
8391985	8394786	So much to go back for with the Riddler trophies and the little side.
8394806	8395867	He's beaten the Riddler mission.
8395887	8396507	Oh my God.
8397207	8398868	I barely dented that.
8399153	8401294	which is actually pretty messed up.
8402455	8403335	Yeah, and not that hard.
8404796	8410079	Alright, so now we're going to go around and get the number one picks.
8410820	8412101	Oh my gosh, here it is.
8412241	8414022	The game of the year according to us.
8414702	8414922	Alan.
8415483	8415763	Portal 2.
8417629	8418810	Thank you for watching!
8433575	8461767	narrative writing and it's a hilarious game it's an emotional game you feel sympathetic for both Wheatley and GLaDOS you learn so much backstory for pretty much everyone including even Shell if you know how to look for it and it's a very it really just holds on to you and it never lets go it's quick once you beat it once if you love the story so much you can run through it again in a couple hours and it never feels stale
8463067	8486666	and it really um Valve especially with Half-Life 2 episodes 1 and 2 really have tried to increase their game as far as script writing and story being told through dialogue but Portal 2 is where they're really like you're gonna listen to this and you're gonna be invested in these characters and also here's awesome puzzle you know puzzle cracking too where you have to need to figure out what to do so
8490748	8493229	DarkSakura, your number one game of the year.
8493449	8497310	I will answer it with a sound from my phone if it will play.
8505872	8506652	I hope that made it through.
8507116	8507536	It might have.
8507556	8507896	A little bit.
8507936	8509137	It's a little quiet, but it made through.
8509237	8511538	It's Portal 2, definitely.
8511898	8517440	Because for all the same reasons that Alan said, and I've beaten it ten times in single player mode.
8517660	8519281	More than ten times now in single player mode.
8520221	8521542	I keep playing through that game.
8521802	8523683	I've probably played through that game once a month.
8524903	8525863	And poor Wheatley.
8553052	8569044	and I love that actor so much I was watching him on Graham Norton one time where he was paid a thousand pounds to be donated to charity to do a somersault on stage and he had never done one before and this man is tall this man is like a moose
8570878	8573319	Well, people would get my reference from Supernatural, but anyway.
8573940	8574440	He's tall.
8574540	8575941	He's very tall, very lanky.
8576461	8577882	I think he's taller than you, Alan.
8579142	8586106	And just watching how good-natured he is, and the fact that he brings so much of himself into the character, I thought it was perfect.
8587147	8593430	And you can really hear that fun part, even when Wheatley's being an evil bastard.
8594210	8595051	It's just awesome, so...
8596051	8600694	That and, you know, the giant mutant potato and all of the reoccurring jokes.
8601695	8606177	And I even went in and tried to find all the stuff that did make it into the final game.
8606858	8609199	Like the Garfield conversation in co-op mode.
8610220	8616464	Where apparently the two little robots, Atlas and Peabody, were supposed to go and find a Garfield comic.
8617064	8623068	And GLaDOS rewrites it to say that John Arbuckle filled the house with neurotoxin.
8623548	8625269	Too bad it's not Garfield without Garfield.
8626608	8630732	I'll have to find you the little file to play.
8631601	8631901	All right.
8633102	8636244	My number one game of the year might surprise some people.
8638146	8644671	But I really had to sit back and go, I don't ever beat video games anymore.
8645191	8649794	And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that maybe I play these MMOs, games you can't beat.
8650235	8660062	The fact that I do this show or I just love video games so much that I try to play as many games as possible so I never have that attention span to finish a game.
8660542	8666950	and I know it's a notorious joke on this show what bad gamer ADD I have that I never finish games.
8667110	8669013	It's like, ooh, Sparkly, go here.
8669573	8675721	But there was one game that came out this year that said, sit down and fucking play me till I'm finished.
8675821	8676582	Just Dance ABBA.
8678499	8681600	That was the best 30 minutes of my life.
8681700	8682440	Contemplated it.
8682500	8682840	No, no.
8682980	8684161	It's not Just Dance ABBA.
8684221	8684521	Shut up.
8686661	8688062	You can't beat Just Dance ABBA.
8689022	8698885	But I was absolutely sucked into this game start to finish, and it's an amazing fucking video game, and it's the best video game of the year.
8698925	8702166	It's Portal 2, absolutely without question, is the best video game of the year.
8702666	8726637	and it's everything these two said and I will emphasize the fact that this game probably still would have been the game of the year without the co-op or the shit that they've been adding to it since then I haven't even touched co-op I did play a little bit of the co-op I didn't beat co-op, I played a little bit of it and it's like, you know, that just further enhanced the experience of what was already an amazing game and, you know, the story was great
8727177	8732701	I have to admit, the first game I liked, but I didn't love like DarkSakura did.
8733361	8737824	But this game, I think as Alan said a minute ago, made the first game that much better.
8738224	8738825	It was so good.
8741627	8743148	Absolutely, Portal 2 is my game of the year.
8744548	8746650	Interesting that all three of us have picked the same game.
8746890	8751513	In Portal 1, 90% of the story happened in the last two levels of it.
8752053	8765588	and the story up until then you could read the signs and a lot of it was really implied and then at the end the finale when you're doing the big escape that's where you figure out oh okay Portal 2 just hits the ground running you already know what the story is and it just keeps getting better and better and better and better
8770377	8772498	You made it to one of the human habitats.
8773139	8774820	We're looking for an artifact.
8775120	8777201	Think of it as an archaeological dig.
8778162	8781563	Their laughter centered around one of the objects in this room.
8782624	8783124	That's it.
8783665	8784485	Scan it for me.
8785946	8791008	So, this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house.
8791849	8795671	Oh, apparently it's not the cat's house or his
8798702	8801383	The man who owns the lasagna is furious.
8802823	8803303	The end.
8804804	8805284	The end?
8806164	8806864	That's not funny.
8807744	8809265	Do either of you feel like laughing?
8810305	8811745	All right, I'm pulling you out.
8814106	8814806	Welcome back.
8815246	8817167	While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon.
8817627	8818547	It's up on the screen.
8819447	8826329	As you can see, in my version, the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped with deadly neurotoxin dispensers.
8827239	8827399	Briefly.
8827419	8827519	Nice.
8848191	8855447	Oh, and by the way, I was telling the chat room earlier, but Dan and I were at Disneyland in line for Space Mountain going in the best of space.
8856188	8857571	Space!
8860657	8862077	Again, I stand by what we said earlier.
8862097	8863878	We did not compare lists, so I had no idea.
8863898	8867000	I kind of knew DarkSakura would go for Portal 2 as number one.
8867860	8868620	There was no question.
8868660	8870301	I didn't know Alan was going to go there, too.
8871802	8873883	Very, very interesting that we all picked the same game.
8873943	8877825	I would say, for the first time in 10 years, I think we've all picked the same game.
8878305	8879285	Consensus!
8879365	8882567	Hold on, Loki's not here, and I kind of don't think Loki's going to go that way.
8882647	8884768	He'll go Grand Theft Auto 4.
8885428	8886649	Well, that didn't come out this year.
8887169	8888851	I think that was his game last year.
8889232	8893276	I think he's going to go Saints Row the third, which admittedly... I thought it was going to be on your list.
8894598	8897021	It was so fucking... How is Skyrim not on my list?
8898122	8899404	How is Skyrim not on my list?
8900104	8900565	It wasn't on mine.
8900605	8902687	It was that good of a year for games.
8903607	8905828	I mean, Skyrim absolutely should be in my top three.
8905868	8907609	I kind of don't care about Skyrim.
8908990	8912912	But you're not really into those types of games, though.
8912952	8915174	I wouldn't expect you to like Skyrim.
8915374	8919476	Yeah, all the crap that people do in Skyrim, I try to do in WoW.
8921677	8922997	50,000 cheese wheels off the side of the mountain.
8923017	8926858	Well, you can't do that, but I try to climb every mountain and try to get to places that no one can get to.
8927479	8938101	But no, I will admit, for quite some time, Saints Row the Third, just because of the fun factor part of it, that I have not laughed that fucking hard at a video game.
8938842	8939782	Well, except maybe Portal 2.
8940002	8943243	No, I don't even think Portal 2 I laughed as hard as I did at Saints Row the Third.
8943543	8945243	I mean, it's just that fucking good.
8945303	8947304	But it's just, I look back and I go...
8948785	8949709	Your three favorites.
8949869	8950753	Gotta make a commitment.
8951014	8952941	I think Mario edges it out slightly.
8953182	8954025	Combustible lemons.
8957305	8960227	That was the part that cracked me up to no end.
8960807	8968251	I think we'll be able to say Portal 2 is going to end up the official OLR game of the year, just looking at the feedback and so forth.
8968291	8973515	But Loki needs to have his say, so we'll get his input next week on what he thinks the top three games of the year are.
8974335	8975916	Any guesses for Loki games?
8975976	8979918	I mean, I think we have all said Saints Row the Third will probably be his number one, but what else for Loki games?
8980919	8981519	Skylanders.
8982119	8983560	I think he'll put Skyrim on there too.
8984140	8986281	I think he'll put Skyrim in his top three.
8986801	8988802	What's that Battlefield game?
8989182	8990843	He loves Battlefield 3?
8991523	8992263	No, not Battlefield.
8992283	8992843	What am I saying?
8992863	8993864	Like actual Battlefield?
8994064	9001406	No, um... The 1840 or 1940 whatever that he plays with the ants.
9002167	9004867	Oh, Modern War... But they play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
9004907	9005828	No, not that.
9005988	9006108	Oh.
9006128	9008109	I don't know.
9008709	9008869	So...
9009488	9010749	I'm thinking more of Dan.
9037000	9042063	If he could fuck around with it and hack it and stuff, that's the type of stuff he likes.
9042164	9046646	I think his list will be Portal 2, Skyrim, and Saints Row the Third.
9047407	9047827	But we'll see.
9048848	9049988	I found you something else to play.
9050669	9051689	You must play it.
9052130	9052270	Oh!
9052890	9053330	Actdeft.
9054431	9055552	I think this is what you were thinking of.
9055632	9056372	Earth Defense Force.
9056772	9058173	Yeah.
9058373	9059694	Good call, Actdeft.
9059854	9060295	Absolutely.
9060315	9061715	Earth Defense Force will probably be in there.
9062256	9063076	Okay, there's the last thing.
9064037	9064317	It's short.
9064753	9065394	DarkSakura.com
9081460	9082401	Alright, here we go.
9082421	9083262	Alright, I've been thinking.
9083922	9086664	When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade.
9087125	9089066	Make life take the lemons back.
9089507	9090147	Get mad!
9090167	9091949	I don't want your damn lemons!
9091989	9093570	What am I supposed to do with these?
9093950	9095792	Demand to see life's manager.
9096232	9100396	Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons.
9100516	9102117	Do you know who I am?
9102678	9106301	I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down with the lemons.
9106801	9112165	I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!
9115428	9116028	Burning people!
9116168	9117289	He says what we're all thinking!
9118770	9119150	Alright.
9120091	9123133	I'm sorry I don't have the one that had GLaDOS on there because her comments make it extra funny.
9124668	9126489	Alright, so there it is, our Game of the Year discussion.
9126529	9131150	Hope you guys enjoyed, or if you didn't, well, you're welcome to your own opinion.
9131231	9137013	No, well, we got plenty of your opinions on the... I was surprised that only one person said Skyrim.
9138143	9146545	I was limited by the fact that I play games 2-3 years late and the fact that I'm playing Skyrim when it's only 3 years old is actually kind of amazing and it's thanks to you getting it for me when it was cheap
9162608	9163549	All right, let's move on.
9164009	9165410	More gaming news for you guys.
9165430	9166671	We've got the Mailbag FUs of the Week.
9166691	9168633	And, of course, your phone call is coming up in just a little bit.
9169634	9171415	So let's go to Alan with some more news.
9173457	9187128	So there's been a lot of wank going on lately due to a feisty Valve employee who was seen at an event wearing a Half-Life Lambda circle logo with a 3 on it.
9187708	9191091	And people saw that and were like, ooh, Half-Life 3 is coming.
9191871	9208946	I'm a huge Half-Life fan, and for those listening who don't remember, Half-Life 2 proper came out in 2004, nearly 10 years ago, and Half-Life 2 Episode 2 came out in the orange box, which I believe, when did, that was what, September of 07, when Portal 1 came out?
9208966	9209506	I think so.
9216312	9217433	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9230973	9257974	Chet Falasek who is a writer for Half-Life and Left 4 Dead and he also occasionally hits up the official forums has said that all of the rumors that the Half-Life community on the official forums has sort of dredged out and saying that Valve is working up to something there's an alternate reality game similar to what Portal 2 had when they updated the ending to Portal 1 where you call into like modems and you download all of these images all the Portal 2 stuff and
9258895	9259556	It's all trolling.
9259856	9263119	It's all trolling by Half-Life fans like myself, just trolling each other.
9264921	9273730	There's no official ARG, or if there is, of course, it's one of those sort of, you can kind of see through the subtext of his response saying...
9276457	9277417	This is his official response.
9277758	9278718	You are being trolled.
9278818	9279798	There is no ARG.
9279978	9281939	Wheatley's speech was set in Portal 2 fiction.
9281979	9282539	That is all.
9283059	9285840	There has been no directive from Gabe to leak anything.
9286020	9287000	That is all false.
9287380	9293202	So I would imagine there is something to leak, but it's all under lock and key by Valve.
9294062	9296123	Finishing his quote, I just want to say...
9297423	9297943	It's all just trolling.
9328171	9328692	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9344253	9355165	Even if he did get disciplined for it, it's not a fireable offense for him to make a custom t-shirt that he knew was going to get the fandom to lose their minds.
9355946	9359650	And even if he did get in trouble for it, we're not privy to that information.
9359670	9360451	It's none of our business.
9361707	9365828	How could Valve not be doing Half-Life 3 eventually?
9365928	9367688	Like you said, it's their bread and butter.
9369449	9371429	They probably just keep going back and changing stuff.
9371449	9371749	I don't know.
9372169	9374510	I kind of think it's coming soon.
9375490	9376890	What else is left for Valve to do?
9377110	9380951	Well, they're doing Defense of the Ancients.
9381031	9382031	But that's in beta now.
9382151	9383911	Defense of the Ancients is going to be out before E3.
9384271	9386092	So what's Valve got to talk about at E3 this year?
9387212	9387633	Left 4 Dead 3
9406696	9409137	Give the Half-Life fans, throw them a fucking bone.
9409197	9410338	Let this be their year.
9410978	9412639	2012 is the end of the world after all.
9413419	9414640	Let them have their goddamn Half-Life 3.
9414680	9421723	Because it was six years between 1 and 2, and now it's 8 between 2 and conceivably 3 if they would say anything about it.
9421783	9424144	So it's just like, we know that you're working on it.
9424164	9426605	We just want, throw us a bone.
9426665	9427686	And they're like, no, we're not ready.
9427846	9428546	They're like Blizzard.
9428566	9429587	They're not going to tell us shit.
9430307	9431928	And this is all just trolling that's going on right now.
9433048	9433329	All right.
9433949	9435650	At least you'll have Defense of the Ancients to hold you over.
9435991	9437072	I no longer care.
9439393	9439674	All right.
9440474	9443497	Moving on to what I find to be kind of an interesting thing that happened.
9443517	9445739	This has to do with the game Fallout New Vegas.
9446539	9456247	And I guess what happened is that the lead designer behind Fallout New Vegas actually released a mod to go with the game.
9457268	9458489	It's not an official patch.
9459125	9462428	And of course now the source story isn't loading for me, but I read it earlier.
9462488	9473077	And the official patch, or they didn't want to officially patch it because it was changing the games in ways that they may not want to subject everybody to in terms of balancing and so on.
9473517	9473718	So...
9474358	9476080	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9492057	9508363	Slash J. Sawyer underscore FNV underscore mod dot zip But yeah, it's for Fallout New Vegas It will turn up the difficulty Putting it up there to what he wanted in terms of difficulty Hence part of the reasons why they don't want to put it out there for everybody
9508866	9510767	and he also just kind of said, you know what?
9510787	9511468	The game's over.
9511568	9512148	The ship's sailed.
9512188	9513269	Nobody's working on it anymore.
9513289	9513989	There's no testers.
9514029	9514530	There's nothing.
9514570	9516831	This is just me doing what I want to do in my free time.
9517511	9519292	So, Fallout New Vegas is done.
9519533	9525776	So, hold out hope for Fallout 4, I suppose, which would I would think going to be their next game now that Skyrim's out there.
9525896	9528738	Fallout New Vegas is pretty good, I have to say.
9528958	9529118	Yeah.
9530419	9540953	so there you go there is by the way an ultimate edition of Fallout New Vegas coming out on February 7th but that's just all the DLC from Fallout New Vegas originally all put together in one little package there
9542430	9545232	Alrighty, let's go to the mailbag.
9545553	9545813	No.
9546413	9546734	Yes.
9547234	9556061	Every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaundradio.com and DarkSakura threatens to not read them, but then we beat her until she does.
9556422	9557202	Beat, beat, beat.
9557643	9557943	Beat.
9558023	9559224	Bat, bat, bat, bat, bat.
9560125	9560485	Okay.
9560505	9562987	I'm gonna treat you like a Justin Bieber piñata.
9563047	9563868	Bat, bat, bat, bat.
9565089	9566210	Those things were hideous.
9567551	9568832	Just some paper plates and party hats.
9568852	9570213	Paper plates and party hats is what they are.
9570233	9570974	Stapled together.
9572210	9578157	Okay, so the first email comes from Robert M. Somehow I get the feeling that Jamie, if she's in studio tonight, has already seen this.
9578317	9580720	But were you anticipating what I was about me not being here?
9581181	9584004	I mean, I wasn't really seriously thinking of calling in.
9585931	9589574	Okay, if so, please post this link to the chatroom and stop reading this now.
9589834	9594198	Otherwise, here's a pro-toy customizer's version of the Metal Slug Tank.
9594318	9595439	Best of luck in the year ahead.
9595699	9607289	And yeah, I did see this, and I will post it in the chatroom, and if Ranma will be so kind as to put this picture and the link to the article on our Tumblr.
9607429	9608770	That's a little Lego.
9609030	9609831	It's a Lego.
9609851	9610932	It's cute.
9611992	9615971	Metal Slug Cute So I will post this in the chat room now
9619557	9622658	You know, also this music makes me kind of wish I was going on the Matterhorn.
9624518	9625479	Because it's kind of the same.
9625819	9626459	Anyway.
9628740	9636962	So this comes from Holly D. Hey guys, I just wanted to share something that popped into my head when I heard about the poor guys on your show who have had their Xbox Live in-post screwed with.
9636982	9643584	Particularly the guy who said he gave them information to investigate and then they said his credentials weren't right even though they hadn't changed since he opened the case.
9644765	9645185	I was like WTF
9659458	9661639	The first one pretty much hung up on me, so I called back again.
9661679	9666501	This woman told me she could not access the account with me, even though I was calling about an appointment I obviously knew already.
9666561	9674424	I argued with this woman for an hour, and she finally found that my account had been closed, and then the guy who set up the new service opened a new one and put in some BS number.
9675004	9679729	So I had to reopen the old account, but she kept insisting that I had to go physically to one of their locations to fix it.
9680189	9687055	I said, like hell I was, and I pointed out to her that if they weren't allowed to change the number, then who the hell gave him permission to change it in the first place?
9687396	9689578	So she could clearly see it had changed.
9690258	9713400	after that she put me on the phone with her supervisor who fixed it took about two hours total the basic point of this is to say try to point out the flaws in their logic and demand to know who authorized changing the information it gets results sometimes because you know if they're claiming they can't change it then they sure as hell know who authorized the first change I hope it helps and I hope they get their accounts back soon Holly D yeah
9715142	9716523	You know what happened with Comcast with us?
9716683	9716883	Huh?
9717203	9727006	We were supposed to have everything fixed on Thursday, and the night before, Dan had a phone call, an automated phone call that said Thursday, and Dan had taken Thursday off work.
9727426	9732148	Well, then he goes to check it in the morning, and it said Friday, when Dan had to be at work.
9733168	9740731	So, he called and he said, I told him to call his supervisor, but I was also, you know, seven in the morning and sleep.
9741351	9741471	So...
9742451	9748416	Sometimes these automations and computers and stuff just leads to trouble.
9748496	9749076	It's a problem.
9749116	9749977	Fail is what it is.
9750217	9752158	She had to talk to a human being to get anything done.
9753279	9753639	Well, no.
9754080	9755721	Dan tried to talk to a human being and she wouldn't change it.
9757258	9758680	Hey guys, it's Blade 3 again.
9758700	9761682	I just wanted to say sorry about my grammar a couple weeks ago.
9762102	9763143	I give everyone a hard time.
9763643	9764544	She gives everyone shit.
9764804	9766405	But use a period after a go, please.
9767266	9770789	I was on a PSP 2000 semicolon and comma.
9771109	9772310	That's wrong.
9772991	9775533	By the way, I was wondering what studio equipment you use.
9775953	9780877	I'm setting up a recording studio and I was curious that should have a U in it about your mics and whatnot.
9781557	9787543	Please keep it up, the awesome work.
9788724	9791066	Well, it's not as complicated as you'd think, the setup.
9791186	9796911	I know for a show that's been around as long as we have, you'd think we'd have this fancy thing going on, but it's actually not that complicated.
9797091	9798473	Our first board came off of eBay.
9799073	9800434	Yeah, the first board came off of eBay.
9800474	9806218	The board we're using right now, we did upgrade to a newer board some time ago, and I'll tell you, it's what's called a Eurorack.
9807279	9807740	It's by Behringer.
9807760	9809041	Yeah, it's by Behringer.
9809541	9811482	UB1222FX Pro.
9811883	9816366	There are pictures, if you look at the new studio pictures at orangeonestudio.com, you can see the mixing board sitting there in the background.
9816746	9821310	It's really as simple as we have three microphones, and they're all hodgepodge microphones.
9822130	9823291	I'll take a picture and put it up right now.
9823311	9824292	I've got a radio shack in my hand.
9824592	9826695	Yeah, Loki's is from Radio Shack.
9826996	9830420	DarkSakura's is a Behringer mic that I think she picked up when she picked up the board.
9830861	9834426	Mine was donated by DDR Angel like eight years ago and it still works.
9835247	9837710	She's like, this is an expensive mic and I want you guys to have it.
9837790	9838471	And it still works.
9839553	9840975	I bought this one because my old mic died.
9841655	9845017	Well, the DDR Angel mic is also a backup mic because it is sold.
9845057	9846658	We actually had another mic that broke.
9846818	9848559	And then you've got your Horde House one in the other room.
9848660	9849520	Don't know what that one's from.
9850721	9853643	I think it's another Radio Shack mic, but it's like a newer Radio Shack mic.
9854003	9856524	So they all plug into the board.
9856965	9859206	Every mic that I've bought, I've gotten at Guitar Center.
9860126	9863229	And every mic I think I've got at Radio Shack, maybe one at Fry's.
9863670	9865672	But anyway, they all plug into the board.
9865732	9867394	We try to equalize things on the board.
9867454	9870517	I realize our voices are not always equalized.
9870557	9872419	We try best we can to adjust things on the fly.
9872859	9881468	But unfortunately, sometimes some of my co-hosts, especially DarkSakura and Loki, tend to be very quiet if they're in a bad mood.
9881828	9882129	Yeah.
9882409	9883410	And then they get very excited!
9885973	9886854	Loki's worse, though.
9887855	9889697	He is a lot worse.
9889797	9894102	By the way, look at our website and our little photos at the top.
9894182	9898146	I just sent a picture of the computer and the soundboard.
9898707	9899467	By themselves.
9901309	9902691	The computer was donated by the listeners.
9902731	9904513	The monitor is from Dan's mom.
9905073	9909538	It's... Okay, when Dan's grandmom got a new computer, we took the monitor.
9910679	9912961	So that's one of our spare monitors.
9913101	9914823	So it's just a simple flat screen monitor.
9915083	9918166	And the computer was donated by the listeners, which was an awesome gesture.
9918506	9923130	That was when I had the Diva Fit one episode and I stormed off the set because... What had happened?
9923591	9925593	I think the show just kind of died in the middle.
9925673	9928576	The computer... Didn't the sound card...
9929136	9931758	The sound card went out and- Just crapped in the middle of the show.
9931818	9933199	I think the graphic card went out too.
9933319	9946389	And then somebody in chat just, you know, sometimes, and they, you know, the person apologized to me afterwards, so I don't mean to like dig up this four-year-old drama, but it was, you know, just unfortunately say the wrong thing at the wrong moment, and I just fucking lost it.
9947609	9955695	And you know it was a moment when Travis called me the next day to go, that was the best thing that has ever happened on OLR.
9955735	9955895	Yeah.
9957777	9973409	and Travis doesn't say nice things about OLR very often but he called me to say Rob that was the best thing you ever did on OLR but the listeners after hearing that actually pulled together and bought a new computer and we use it to this day
9974350	9987382	I was in studio DarkSakura when the show computer before this one, it was going to be my second or third guest appearance on OLR, it was when we had just started dating, where the old show computer died.
9987902	9988563	It went kaput.
9990034	9990594	DarkSakura.com
10013121	10014562	No, no, no, that was my donation.
10014602	10015843	That was yours, that's right.
10016283	10018084	But that's the one that crapped out on that show.
10018224	10018524	Yeah.
10018604	10019605	That caused me to lose it.
10020165	10023888	No, because it was 5.30 and you were firing up the computer and getting everything ready.
10024488	10027090	And it just, it died, it stopped.
10027810	10029211	Oh, yeah, something happened.
10029231	10031192	That was right before we got, no, that was it.
10031212	10032213	But we were able to fix it.
10032333	10033193	We were able to fix it.
10033334	10038137	Something, it was something we found out later on was like a setting or something was screwed up, but we were able to fix it.
10038177	10040378	But it just screwed the show that night, so.
10040398	10040478	Yeah.
10040658	10058912	and yeah and also the uh this soundboard that you guys have just goes into the line in on your sound card and then you guys use what audition for the yeah we use audition for the for the podcasting itself yeah the mixing board goes into the computer through the line in and then it's all recorded straight in adobe audition
10059212	10060192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10075578	10078459	My old laptop had the capability, except for that card, it was actually listed as speaker output.
10078499	10078579	Hmm.
10099793	10101555	So yeah, well different sound cards.
10101755	10105860	Anything that came, you want to have it set to anything that's going to come out of the speaker.
10106121	10110866	I think somebody explained it to me as you want a full duplex card and not a half duplex card.
10111227	10113690	Because full duplex is what's capable in and out at the same time.
10114150	10115632	So that's very important.
10116032	10120017	If you're going to do podcasts from your computer, spend the extra money to get a nicer sound card and you'll be set.
10120177	10125202	My nice awesome quad core computer doesn't have a sound card that does that, but my old crappy laptop does.
10129066	10134130	In the chat, DarkTetsuya says, oh, I think he had that clip on Understation Live not too long after.
10134150	10134811	There's a clip?
10135392	10135812	Oh, Lord.
10136633	10142919	Well, it probably was all recorded on Justin.TV, or did Justin.TV go out when the rest of it went out?
10143079	10143479	I don't remember.
10143499	10145121	I think we were using Justin.TV.
10146115	10146695	I don't remember.
10146915	10148996	Well, because we were in the garage studio when that happened.
10149237	10153419	Yeah, I think Justin TV was out, but... I don't remember.
10153839	10154959	It was so long ago now.
10155000	10157521	I'm sure that clip will show up soon enough, though.
10158281	10161363	And Ranma says it's Sound Blaster, Odigy, or Better.
10161923	10163024	That's what you're going to want out of a card.
10163664	10166905	Anyway, that's my very long-winded memory lane answer to that short question.
10167486	10168826	Well, we have one last email.
10168906	10169147	Okay.
10169527	10175670	And actually, it's from... Well, it didn't... I'm just going to say from Nigel.
10177051	10179952	Here's an article from The Guardian, UK national newspaper.
10180092	10181393	I read The Guardian all the time, so yeah.
10181813	10183453	That might interest one DarkSakura.
10184354	10186094	And here it is.
10186334	10189575	Playing video games makes me sick, is what it's called.
10190396	10193617	And I scammed it over, and...
10196149	10197630	I'll go ahead and read this bit of the paragraph.
10199411	10200932	And he's talking about playing MW3.
10200952	10201212	He says,
10226205	10231309	For me, it was triggered from the first time I played such a game, the PlayStation Classic Doom in 1995.
10233070	10242076	And for me, the pixel games don't do it to me that badly, like Doom, but the worst game that ever did it to me was...
10243757	10244658	Crap, what was it?
10244778	10246760	Goldeneye on Nintendo 64.
10247500	10250483	That game would make me so sick.
10250683	10256287	I couldn't watch, because Dan was playing through it at the time, and he loves that game, and I wanted to love it.
10256408	10257188	I really did.
10257669	10258329	Nope, sick.
10258729	10259971	I couldn't play Unreal.
10260271	10265655	I couldn't play the newer Quakes, because anything that was actually 3D would make me sick.
10266036	10267597	Katamari made me super sick.
10267717	10269859	Portal makes me way sick.
10270339	10273742	because it doesn't have that fast reorientation the way that Portal 2 does.
10274342	10277985	So Portal 2 made me sick at first, but I could get used to it.
10278425	10279906	And now I can play it with no problem.
10280326	10287732	I mean, I do have to stop every few levels and let my eyes readjust, but I can't play the first Portal for very long at all because it will make me very nauseous.
10288132	10291794	Technically, you're supposed to do that with any game anyway, every 30 minutes or so.
10291814	10292954	How many people do that, Rob?
10293114	10295935	Well, I'm just saying, you're supposed to, and there's a reason.
10296195	10297936	Well, I'm usually also multitasking.
10297976	10299537	I'm talking to people while I'm playing Portal.
10300997	10306479	But yeah, basically, it's just... Here's another thing that he says.
10306639	10307000	The U.S.
10307100	10316744	Army Research Institute for Behavioral Social Science also studied flight simulators and found that slightly fewer than half of pilots using them reported symptoms similar to motion sickness.
10318104	10326109	So, this is actually super cool, and I would also, in fact, I'm gonna link this in the chat room as well, because I think that other people will benefit from this.
10327309	10328890	Spazinator, you can shut the fuck up.
10331592	10333753	Spazinator, by the way, said, wanna play some GoldenEye?
10334634	10337115	But to be fair, he did put colon P, which means he isn't serious.
10337275	10337575	I know.
10337815	10339797	And I wasn't serious, although...
10341075	10353684	but yeah I just would get so sick and I get a little motion sick in a car if I'm not driving but yeah alright that it for emails?
10354865	10366973	you know what I do not complain every other second so AGN728 bite me bite me that's not a complaint that's a command you should complain about the fact that they can't be bothered to change your nickname
10368524	10368964	Yeah.
10370545	10370825	All right.
10371206	10371946	Moving on.
10372306	10374988	I wonder if that's for Angry Gaming Nerd, maybe?
10376189	10378690	No, it's somebody that's coming from All Games Radio, All Games Network.
10378750	10381252	They're in the All Games chat as opposed to chat.orange.radio.
10381752	10383353	Dude, you didn't have to kick him.
10384694	10385735	What'd you kick him for?
10385855	10386995	I can handle my own battles.
10387136	10389357	I'm a grown woman and I can fight my own battles.
10390157	10390718	Now look at that.
10390858	10392459	Despite all that, she's got your back.
10392839	10394119	Despite all that, she has your back.
10394139	10394760	Despite all that.
10395320	10396740	You need to slap Ranma with a trout right now.
10396760	10398341	Because I wanted to kick him myself.
10398461	10399921	I mean, no, I'm kidding.
10400081	10401822	I wouldn't have done that because I'm a good girl.
10401902	10403663	I will slap Ranma with a trout for you.
10403783	10404183	Thank you.
10404203	10404483	There you go.
10404523	10405703	All right.
10406764	10410325	We need to, we actually, I wish we could change that to like with large boobs or something.
10411865	10412646	All right, moving on.
10412766	10413026	Okay.
10413346	10414066	We got to move on.
10415947	10416527	FUs of the Week.
10416747	10421949	Oh, speaking of complaints, what a perfect time for us to do our normal segment of the FUs of the Week.
10436972	10443158	Um, really, my complaint is fuck you to moving.
10444119	10446502	Because moving is awful.
10447583	10451807	I mean, I like being in the new house that isn't falling apart like my old house was.
10452928	10458735	I hate paying rent now, but I really like being in the new place.
10459275	10463520	And it's just the soreness and the pain that comes with all the moving.
10464000	10467844	And not really just the physical stuff, but the emotional side of it too.
10467905	10470708	Because, I mean, Dan and I lived at that old house.
10471368	10473631	We got married living in that old house.
10474474	10476676	We had lots of wonderful fights in that old house.
10477717	10480060	We've done lots of other things in that house.
10480780	10482061	Shermie's pooped on it.
10483042	10485285	You know, how many... Shermie hasn't pooped on this house yet.
10485305	10487307	You've prayed in that house, is what you meant to say.
10489369	10490470	Yeah, Rob, I've prayed.
10490830	10492071	I've prayed a lot.
10492932	10494293	Oh God, oh God, oh God.
10495822	10496623	No.
10497964	10505269	But I mean, on top of that, that house before, you know, we rented from our friends and they got married in the backyard of that house.
10505749	10506090	Oh, wow.
10506310	10509212	So, I mean, we have lots of memories of going over there to visit our friends, too.
10509933	10513375	You know, a decade of memories of that house.
10514176	10516938	So, you know, we're going to miss our neighbors.
10516978	10517758	We told them where we live.
10518219	10519540	We literally moved three blocks away.
10520420	10523522	I have to add a thank you to Dan for this morning.
10524362	10529565	When he kind of woke me up when he was about to leave, he said, you don't have to do anything today.
10530085	10536788	You have my full blessing to stay in bed all day or play WoW all day if you want to.
10537629	10540030	I will not expect a single chore out of you.
10540690	10541791	So I got up and did the dishes.
10543078	10546809	No, I did the dishes when I got up because I just wanted my coffee cup.
10551044	10554747	Well, Dan did all that, so... We have this kind of jack thing.
10555587	10562553	It's got a big metal platform on top, and you put it under the table, and you jack it up like a car jack.
10563593	10564594	He had to jack it.
10566015	10570178	But it lifts the whole table up so that you can move it on this wheeled object.
10570598	10576263	So that in and of itself isn't very heavy, and you can raise it to the level of a truck and slide it in.
10576903	10577744	Wow.
10577864	10579066	There's a science to that shit.
10579086	10580748	The refrigerator was harder to move.
10581570	10585635	Because we had to take the doors off the house and the doors off the refrigerator to get the damn thing in.
10585775	10586737	Alright, we gotta move on with the FUs.
10586777	10587117	Okay.
10587197	10587398	Alright.
10588018	10588219	Alan.
10591192	10607378	Oh boy, um, it's a new year, it's when people set arbitrary expectations on life changes, you know, resolutions, and I'm like really fat right now, so I've ended up being really out of shape and weighing the most I've ever weighed in my life.
10607398	10609979	I blame happiness.
10612136	10613277	It's relationship weight.
10614197	10615258	Yeah, I'm so miserable.
10615378	10623943	No, it's being unemployed, and, you know, it's apparently done wonders for my appetite that I don't need, so... I just need to lose weight.
10625684	10627985	That happened, though, when I first moved out here and moved in with Dan.
10628805	10634649	I went from a size 12, which I don't care, I've always had some butt to me, to a 24 size.
10637063	10639707	So, I think Rob's accurate.
10639747	10647879	I mean, it happens when you're not working, relationship weight, when you're... A lot of stuff involved, so... And you're certainly not a size 24 anymore.
10648460	10650984	No, I lost 60 pounds.
10651725	10651925	Yeah.
10651985	10652346	You're not!
10654588	10667434	When I was helping do volunteer crew for Umlaut, the rock band fundraiser, it's fine now, but for a day or two after, for a good two weeks, my right knee was hurting because I guess I picked something up wrong.
10667514	10670995	Better than my back, which is injured, but it's okay now.
10671275	10672476	And it's like, that means you're getting old.
10672736	10675557	Lift stuff up means you're out of shape and you're getting old.
10676118	10678819	So just being out of shape and overweight.
10680917	10697278	Um, my FU of the week, I don't know, I don't really have a lot, because, shit, I'm on vacation right now, and I, I have an extra week off, I don't have to go back tomorrow like most people do, so, and I'm going to Disneyland, shit, life's pretty fucking good right now, so, FU to the fact that it all has to end sometime.
10697639	10698640	FU for not taking me.
10699571	10702774	Well, F you to you for not being taken.
10703055	10703435	I don't know.
10703935	10704216	All right.
10706538	10707419	Heart, heart, heart.
10707539	10708260	That's it.
10708320	10709341	That's it for the FUs of the week.
10709421	10709721	All right.
10710122	10714086	Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line and take your Twitter topics.
10714226	10716408	I don't think we have a lot of Twitter topics yet, but we'll see.
10716808	10718670	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10718730	10721013	But first, just a couple quick stories for you guys.
10721273	10721433	Alan.
10722970	10727173	Team Meat, who made the amazing sort of... God.
10727233	10727813	I know, right?
10728314	10729475	Did you see Actdeft in chat?
10730055	10730255	Yeah.
10730875	10731976	That you took an arrow to the knee?
10731996	10732276	Yes.
10733717	10734258	Die!
10734918	10738801	I have a sneeze on deck, so I'm going to try and burn through this story.
10739201	10750229	Team Meat released a game called The Binding of Isaac, and it's the same art as Super Meat Boy, which is a great retro-ish game that made a lot of top ten lists for this year.
10751390	10754212	The Binding of Isaac, it's currently available on PC via Steam.
10754733	10759878	They're in talks to bring it to the 3DS via their 3DS app store.
10760458	10763081	And you are just playing VVVVV on the 3DS.
10763141	10765263	Different developer, but it's still a Steam indie game.
10765943	10767245	Now available on a handheld.
10767925	10774111	Team Meat is trying to bring The Binding of Isaac, which I guess is a roguelike dungeon crawler game.
10774912	10778335	It has some biblical story points to it.
10778576	10780798	Apparently it's really awesome.
10780838	10783120	Kind of gross, but Super Meat Boy was kind of gross too.
10783140	10784121	It has the same art style.
10784581	10786003	Look for it on the 3DS.
10786203	10787364	Maybe they're in talks.
10788245	10789206	That is interesting.
10789406	10790047	Very interesting.
10790087	10793630	I kind of like where that's going if a lot of those indie games are suddenly going to show up on 3DS.
10793670	10803518	They wanted to bring Super Meat Boy to the Wii, but the limitations on the patching and how big I think the max file size could be, they couldn't do it.
10803578	10811185	So the fact that they're still talking to Nintendo trying to get their next game after Super Meat Boy 2, the 3DS is a great sign.
10812671	10812952	Awesome.
10814255	10814576	All right.
10816461	10818867	And lastly tonight, a story that...
10820428	10821369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10842985	10866619	new copies have a code that comes with it but an online pass is purchased through the PlayStation Network if you have a used or a downloaded copy now this was amended later on because I guess at first they were like oh shit if you download it you have to get the online pass as well but it actually was updated to say that hold on the online pass is actually already included when you download it on PlayStation Network so you don't have to download it separately just to be fair
10867319	10871884	So the online passes though, they are going over to the PS Vita.
10872305	10876449	Now the online pass will cost 900 yen for Hot Shots Golf.
10876489	10879893	That's about $11.50 US.
10879933	10885679	So you can expect $10 probably to be about the same price here in the US.
10886941	10887121	So...
10888816	10891757	Well, I guess it's probably not surprising to hear, right?
10892497	10892817	Yeah.
10893478	10893778	All right.
10894978	10896239	Let's go to the phones.
10896279	10897599	We're going to open up the phones right now.
10898039	10898359	I'm sorry.
10898399	10900900	I was doing my hair.
10900920	10904221	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10904721	10909603	We're going to go to the Twitter topics real quick and read some of the stories and things you guys want to talk about.
10910143	10912305	Not a whole lot of feedback this week.
10912725	10916529	Didn't get a lot through the week probably because of the holidays.
10917049	10917990	But let's see.
10918190	10923615	Redertainment tweeted us saying, voting is live for the fourth annual The Four Star Awards.
10924115	10924595	What is that?
10924796	10928619	Is that like your own personal... What is The Four Star Awards?
10928699	10929119	I don't know.
10929479	10930520	And we're not nominated.
10931141	10936926	Granted, there's no podcast category, but we should be nominated for Movie of the Year.
10939133	10939514	Mm-hmm.
10940336	10940777	Whatever.
10940817	10941599	It's on Facebook.
10941619	10942721	You want to check it out.
10942962	10943262	All right.
10945731	10947132	We'll pimp out any awards show.
10947152	10948052	What the hell?
10948072	10951114	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10951874	10954176	Um, Tigerclaw sent us a couple quick tweets here.
10954596	10955696	I read about one of these earlier.
10955756	10958978	He sent us a tweet about dude turned Swapnote into an RPG.
10959358	10963020	I have to admit, I didn't pick this story for tonight because I wasn't sure how to explain it.
10964141	10965001	It's a YouTube.
10965041	10972205	It's nine minutes long, so I'm not going to play the entire YouTube for you guys, but some guy... If you don't know what Swapnote is, it came out on the 3DS this week.
10972405	10972866	It's, um...
10973826	10982093	A system that lets you basically exchange emails, except instead of written emails, they're little actual written handwritten notes that you can send to other people.
10982133	10986377	But as you use Swapnote more, you can start to send five second messages or pictures.
10986597	10992843	I actually sent to all the people on my friends list on 3DS, I sent a picture of Maruko, one of the cats here, and sent it out.
10993203	10995544	So, you know, it's kind of like a fun way to share things.
10995664	10998086	It's like, oh, wow, Nintendo is actually embracing the Internet for something.
10998426	11003089	Well, somebody actually turned it into a full-fledged RPG in the vein of Dungeons & Dragons.
11003629	11006070	And I guess there's even like a Dungeon Master template you can use.
11006611	11009132	And he talks about all this in his YouTube on how he did it.
11009192	11015816	Again, it's a little long for me to play here, but it's mncdover is the username on YouTube if you want to look that up for yourself.
11017297	11026709	and one other tweet here from Tigerclaw Epic Games scores a victory against Silicon Knights in a two-human suit
11028658	11030659	And I don't even remember what this suit was all about.
11030699	11031700	So I'm loading the story now.
11031740	11034602	He's linked us to a story at the multiplayer blog at MTV.com.
11036403	11037424	And let's see.
11038665	11046110	Too Human was supposed to be the start of the next great expansive RPG franchise and the reasons that gamers were wanting Xbox 360 back in the early days.
11047170	11075596	the Silicon Knights developed game was supposed to be a big deal but the game was delayed for two years the critical response to the game was less enthusiastic and what was intended to be a trilogy was dead on arrival with just 130,000 units sold and Microsoft ending their agreement with Silicon Knights I guess Silicon sued Epic Games over 2Human saying that Epic misrepresented the functionality of the Unreal Engine which was used for 2Human resulting in the two year delay wow interesting
11076076	11085839	Well, the case against Epic Games took a blow because one of the key witnesses was excluded from giving testimony after a ruling by Judge James Denver III.
11086779	11100823	The testimony was going to break it down into dollars and cents terms what the negative impact of working with the Unreal Engine was supposed to have on Silicon Knights, but the testimony was found to be questionable and that the methods did not fit the facts of the case.
11101423	11101803	Interesting.
11101943	11103484	I didn't realize there was all this drama going on.
11103524	11105206	Of course, this was a game that wasn't on my radar.
11105786	11109388	And maybe the fact that it wasn't on my radar is part of the reason why it didn't sell so good.
11109469	11110669	But there you go.
11111830	11112110	All right.
11112190	11113711	Anyhow, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
11113751	11114652	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11114672	11115012	Who's this?
11116153	11119115	Ooh, hey, you don't sound so good.
11119215	11119675	Try again.
11119956	11120256	Who's this?
11123044	11125405	Is it just me that doesn't hear that at all?
11125425	11129106	It's really... You sound like a Dalek.
11129186	11129587	I can't.
11129667	11133628	I'm hoping... Oh God, I hope that's... It was Zaku, obviously, that was calling in.
11133648	11136129	He might have been able to make that out, but I couldn't understand him at all.
11136649	11140170	No, neither could I. Now, was that his connection or was that ours?
11140231	11141851	See, now all these things I'm going to question.
11141911	11142992	Is it the new studio setup?
11143012	11144052	So let me just see real quick here.
11146901	11147441	Real quick here.
11148002	11150324	Hello, welcome to Skype call testing service.
11150384	11151245	See, that works fine.
11151325	11152386	Hello, British lady.
11152687	11153588	Hello, British lady.
11153888	11155850	Let's see if maybe this next call sounds a little cleaner.
11155890	11156691	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11156711	11157051	Who's this?
11158293	11163638	Hello, Derek H. Hi, Derek H. See, I can understand Derek just fine.
11163879	11165300	Our last call was a little weird.
11165520	11166962	All right, anyhow, Derek, what's on your mind, buddy?
11169058	11170740	I would like to talk about video games.
11170840	11171821	I've called you guys.
11172982	11174143	There's this thing called Steam.
11174163	11176305	I don't know if you've heard of it.
11176565	11178207	Oh, a friend was telling me about Steam.
11178267	11179108	We don't play games.
11180229	11181050	I play board games.
11181070	11182291	We sure eat a lot of food though.
11182311	11183932	Would you like to play some Risk?
11184333	11185474	Or maybe Axis and Allies?
11186415	11189017	I was thinking more about Wits and Wagers maybe.
11190894	11191895	So Steam, yes.
11192095	11193176	Yes, I've heard of Steam.
11193376	11194277	I think the listeners do too.
11195138	11204707	I've had Steam for a long time and I only buy games when they're like... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
11204847	11205587	Derek, you cut out.
11205627	11208470	If you can hear me, you like totally cut out.
11208890	11209291	It sounds like...
11209798	11210879	What the hell's going on?
11211119	11215342	It's like the void of calls.
11217463	11218944	Your voice like dropped out.
11219044	11221686	So did your mic come unplugged or something?
11224548	11225869	Hello, trying Derek again.
11226009	11226510	One, two, three.
11226570	11227750	I see that we're still connected.
11227790	11228771	It's not an internet thing.
11229292	11231353	But he just, the voice dropped out.
11231853	11233054	I don't even know if he can hear us.
11233474	11233915	He hung up.
11234795	11235656	That's a bummer.
11237771	11243774	I don't even know what he was about to say about Steam, but I think it was like, I only buy games when... And I'm thinking it was maybe when they're on sale.
11243894	11244775	Yeah, dirt cheap.
11245535	11245775	Maybe.
11246015	11249577	Maybe it was going to lead to a question about is that bad for the industry?
11249657	11249958	I don't know.
11249998	11250198	Let's see.
11250518	11251759	I just want to make sure here real quick.
11251779	11257121	Let's just... Maybe this studio is a bad omen for calls.
11257161	11257402	Let's see.
11257442	11257722	Hello.
11257982	11259783	Welcome to Skype Core Testing Service.
11260243	11262264	After the beep, please record a message.
11262804	11265066	Afterwards, your message will be played back to you.
11266277	11271742	Hi, I'm doing really professional internet radio right now, and I am testing a Skype connection live.
11271963	11272964	I love you, British lady.
11274385	11274845	On the air.
11276287	11277488	This is all DarkSakura's fault.
11277828	11282713	Hi, I'm doing really professional internet radio right now, and I am... See, it's fine.
11285336	11285696	What's up?
11288220	11290365	You know what's up is this delicious stew.
11290425	11291127	It's amazing.
11291207	11291989	Thank you so much.
11292009	11295657	The delicious pop is just put in front of my mouth begging me to eat.
11296098	11297040	What did you make here?
11298220	11308892	It's just stew, cubed stew beef, small red potatoes, carrots, and I actually cut up two blood oranges and threw them in there.
11309072	11310133	I can taste the citrus.
11310153	11310954	I can taste it too, yeah.
11311374	11314277	I used a peeler to get the rind, the orange.
11314678	11315158	The zest.
11315539	11315919	All right.
11315979	11319283	So it's Orange Lounge Studio.
11319303	11320304	Oh.
11322666	11325169	Oh my god, we're breaking up.
11325469	11327451	I've had that in my head like all night.
11327831	11330954	All right, let's move on to another call.
11331554	11332355	Maybe this one will work.
11332395	11333216	Hi, you're on Orange Ones Radio.
11333236	11333556	Who's this?
11334257	11334897	It's Shane.
11334998	11338221	Okay, well, so far we can hear you and you're not a robot, so that's good.
11338241	11338801	Hi, Shane.
11339101	11340543	Awesome, I'm not a robot.
11340643	11341363	That's cool.
11341443	11342324	What's on your mind, Shane?
11343025	11343405	I don't know.
11343806	11345968	I was calling to see if your stuff would work, pretty much.
11348072	11350653	Well, only the collar appears to be broken this time.
11350893	11354995	Shane, you need to come play with me on the Horde server.
11355996	11358957	Oh, but there's so much Star Wars going on right now.
11358977	11359758	You know what?
11359798	11360358	Poo on that.
11360418	11361559	Then let's talk Star Wars.
11361939	11364820	Because you were just telling me earlier, you do nothing but play Star Wars now.
11365381	11366821	Yeah, it's really sad.
11367001	11371163	I came on here and I said, you know, I like Star Wars and I don't like Star Wars for these particular reasons.
11371644	11374285	So what are your thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic?
11374818	11391660	well first of all I'd like to say I did not listen to what you said about why you like it and why you do not so I don't know if I'm going to copy you or anything but I like it because the story is really cool and I don't know anything about Star Wars so this is all new to me like every single last thing
11394372	11395013	Okay, I'm still there.
11395033	11396534	I hear stuff in the background.
11396734	11397535	Yeah, we're just eating.
11397555	11398716	We're stuffing our face while you're talking.
11398836	11399677	Oh, that's what I was doing.
11399697	11400418	I was eating crappy McDonald's.
11400438	11401739	I'm trying to ask you long questions.
11403861	11405042	That wasn't a very long question.
11405062	11405943	All right.
11406724	11414130	I don't like it because it doesn't feel polished still, which is expected because it's such a new game.
11414751	11416713	But that will come with time.
11416893	11418534	WoW wasn't that great at vanilla.
11418595	11419655	I played it a little bit.
11420336	11446506	but I'm really digging it like there's plot twists and every single class so far has been really fun to play which I can't say the same for WoW but I do love WoW I'm in a year commitment with WoW I have it like fully paid off with time cards so I don't really care if I'm not playing it right now so but I'm really enjoying Star Wars I just got a ship on one of my characters and it's pretty cool I'm eating
11450737	11451858	So describe the glasses for us.
11452958	11454419	Oh my god, you pigs.
11456780	11457060	Okay.
11457400	11458781	Hey, some of us haven't had dinner.
11459722	11464004	Well, that's what I was doing, and then I thought I would call in help to make sure your Skype was working.
11464064	11464804	Wait, wait, no, no, no.
11464964	11465405	No, hold on.
11465545	11466445	I got another question for you.
11466525	11466725	Okay.
11467666	11470867	My question is, what is supposed to happen in the endgame of Star Wars?
11471108	11474929	I don't know, because I can't even figure out the non-endgame yet.
11475110	11475310	Like...
11476050	11479352	There's no hand-holding for the most part, except for at the very beginning.
11480313	11490759	And so I'm just kind of pretending I know what I'm doing, and it's not working out so well in some situations, like some quests I kind of suck at.
11491299	11491800	But oh well.
11493321	11498924	I haven't seen but maybe two level 50 characters, and their armor is ugly, so I don't even care about endgame yet.
11498964	11499824	I just want story.
11501886	11502726	Something just occurred to me.
11503347	11503527	What?
11503807	11505128	We're sitting at a table eating.
11506089	11506509	I know, right?
11506850	11507150	I know.
11507510	11508211	Who does that anymore?
11509211	11518038	So Shane, have you had any problems with like leveling up, like keeping your crafting up to level with what level you are and using the auction house?
11518058	11522882	Because Rob, I haven't played it myself, but Rob was saying that he has trouble with how auction house works.
11523462	11525544	The auction house is pretty terrible.
11525564	11528286	The auction house works like Final Fantasy XI's auction house in some ways.
11528626	11530307	It's like a hybrid between XI and WoW.
11530347	11530748	It's weird.
11531548	11548324	I don't really like it, but the crafting, funny enough, I'm actually doing right now while I'm on this Skype stuff because I was not paying attention to it because part of the crafting aspect is that your companions do it and not you.
11548905	11556191	So I now have two companions, so I can kind of do two things at once, but my companion, that's a...
11556932	11565596	I can run around the world with and do stuff with and fight is my tank and I'm a healer so I kind of need him to not craft because he goes away when he crafts.
11566216	11575381	So I'm just leveling up the little thing that makes lightsaber crystals right now because it's really, really far behind.
11577062	11577662	But I like it.
11577802	11579823	Are we going to get on our characters later and do flashpoints?
11580711	11582832	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11606165	11609087	I like the starter flashpoints for both sides now.
11609907	11618273	It's neat because you can completely change the outcome of that flashpoint story based on dialogue options.
11618353	11625158	So all my characters, for the most part, are light side, even though they might be Imperial or Republic.
11625578	11628400	So I save the captain from being killed.
11628440	11630161	I save this general from being killed.
11630381	11634264	I take this chick with me that the commander wants killed.
11635164	11642671	So if my choice gets picked out of the random rolls, it affects the rest of the story for everybody for that specific flashpoint.
11643511	11645053	So that's really neat to me.
11645173	11649677	And they don't feel that long, even though I think they're like an hour long each.
11650677	11659945	But I did just yesterday run a second flashpoint on one of my characters.
11659985	11660726	I don't remember who.
11661607	11663108	And it was very dull.
11663592	11665635	because it was all brown.
11665675	11670981	It was like playing Gears of War or any other FPS that's come out in the last couple years.
11672026	11672146	Wow.
11672166	11672246	Wow.
11702361	11705862	I was going to say I ask myself that a lot when I cry myself to sleep at night.
11706862	11707182	All right.
11708643	11712344	Anyhow, I should probably let you go soon so we can get other calls, hopefully.
11712444	11715685	But do you have any other closing thoughts for us tonight, Shane?
11716165	11722927	I was going to participate in that top three games of the year thing on Facebook, and then I got lazy and didn't type anything out.
11723427	11726268	But Portal 2 would have been my number one as well.
11726548	11733473	After thinking about every single game that came out this year, I didn't sit through any other game from start to finish this year except for Portal.
11733973	11744340	I think what we should have done is a top three most disappointing games of the year because there were a lot of hyped games that did not meet expectations at all.
11744360	11745761	My number one would piss people off.
11747182	11750644	My top three would probably make lots of people angry.
11750664	11753206	You can make people angry because they can't send hate mail to you.
11753726	11754647	So what's your top three?
11755407	11756228	Most disappointing.
11756648	11756868	DarkSakura
11786912	11788113	You said you like Strider, right?
11789614	11790174	No, no.
11790194	11791115	I like Phoenix Wright.
11791335	11791956	Oh, Phoenix Wright?
11792136	11793977	Okay.
11794577	11795378	Well, he can be wrong.
11797299	11798640	You can choke on a potato, too.
11800402	11801823	I agree with Dragon Age 2.
11802723	11807266	I believe I've picked up every NPC that I can, I think.
11807747	11812510	I just got off the mountain where Flemeth is there and you do the thing where Flemeth comes back.
11813071	11816453	I don't care about the side characters like I did in Origins.
11816897	11819580	Yeah, the story's just not as good.
11819880	11821101	The combat's more fun.
11822022	11823904	I own it on PC and PS3.
11823924	11825385	That's how much I cared about Dragon Age 1.
11825445	11826406	I was like, oh, I love 2.
11826666	11827427	It's gonna be awesome.
11827987	11828188	No.
11829309	11834734	I'm gonna beat it simply because I'm committed to the world that they've built, but the writing isn't as good.
11835396	11835576	No.
11835836	11836117	All right.
11836537	11837998	Shane, I got to let you go so we can get more calls.
11838018	11838558	That's cool.
11838578	11839159	Have a good one, okay?
11839759	11840039	You too.
11840059	11840300	All right.
11840320	11840540	Bye.
11841741	11842141	All right.
11842181	11843842	We're going to go to some more calls.
11843882	11844603	Hooray.
11845483	11846945	Let's try this again.
11847025	11848105	Hi.
11848125	11848506	Who's this?
11849326	11849586	Hello.
11849646	11851308	It's Derek H. from Virginia Beach.
11851508	11852949	Nice to hear from you again.
11853029	11853990	I don't know what happened before.
11854010	11855651	It's a weird internet thing.
11856559	11857219	I blame Skype.
11857459	11860221	Well, it's free, so you can't blame Skype, but I still blame Skype.
11860441	11860741	All right.
11860781	11870505	Well, you were talking about Steam, and you were about to say, you were talking about, I only buy games on Steam when... They're on sale, and that is a huge mistake.
11870565	11872586	I should only buy games on Steam.
11873246	11874486	In fact, I'll say this about everybody.
11874506	11880389	Everybody should only buy games on Steam when they're full price, because then you know that you actually want that game.
11881308	11886857	because I have a... Now, after the last week, I have like eight games I'm never gonna play again.
11889242	11890343	I bought two games.
11890384	11892707	I bought... I looked and I said, oh, wow.
11894209	11896790	There's two flight sims for only $3 a piece.
11897010	11902332	And then I looked and I have a flight stick that had fallen behind my desk like a year ago.
11902352	11905513	And I never even bothered to reach it.
11905593	11908074	And so when I picked it up, it had a layer of dust on it.
11908094	11909795	So I was like, oh, wait, I have a flight stick.
11910475	11911835	I must like flight sims.
11912075	11916857	So I bought those games, played them for 20 minutes and realized I hate flight sims.
11916917	11918178	Raise your hand if you've been there.
11919738	11946781	earlier this year I think it was the Thanksgiving sale they had Dead Space 1 and 2 in a combo pack for like 4 or 5 bucks and I was like alright Dead Space you know Resident Evil with aliens or ghosts in outer space I'll buy that I had already bought it completely forgot that I had bought the rights to download that on my Steam same with Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition it's like oh yeah dirt cheap 3 bucks I get my credit card out oh yeah you bought that 6 months ago but you forgot about it instantly afterward
11948001	11949122	So I definitely have that problem.
11950122	11954664	I have Knights of the Old Republic on the Xbox version, but you can play it on the 360.
11955704	11957805	I bought that two years ago.
11958125	11958965	Actually, four years ago.
11959005	11959565	A long time ago.
11960346	11960966	I don't like it.
11961406	11964247	I'm one of the few people that cannot stand KOTOR.
11965047	11967128	I saw it on Steam.
11967248	11967748	It was only $2.50.
11968168	11973110	I actually struggle with myself not to buy it.
11973210	11974110	I own this game.
11974511	11975251	I don't like it.
11975911	11985334	But it's only $2.50 You posted on Facebook or Google or something about that Because I remember reading that One of my friends worked on that game Really?
11985414	11986115	You know what she called it?
11986195	11986435	What?
11986595	12001080	Scrotor But hey, while she was working on it, we got to go to the Skywalker Ranch Oh, that's when you flung the meatball at George Lucas No, when I wanted to fling meatloaf at George Lucas He walked by and I could have flung meatloaf at him I changed the story a little bit, I embellished
12001520	12002320	You know what, Derek?
12002500	12005181	I did something similar during this most recent Steam sale.
12005361	12007021	I bought Quake Collection.
12007361	12008762	I didn't just buy one Quake game.
12008802	12010742	I bought Quake 1, 2, and 3.
12011082	12012283	Quake 2 isn't even that good.
12012903	12019605	And Quake 1 and 3 were good like 10 years ago, but playing them now, like my video card doesn't know how to handle Quake 3.
12019705	12021945	Like I was having problems getting Quake 3 to even work.
12022385	12025026	Why am I buying Quake 3 when I can just go play Quake live?
12027205	12034911	I almost bought... When they had a thing where you can buy all the Star Wars games or something for like $14, I was like, that's a great deal.
12035432	12043879	Even though I had no interest in buying these games when they came out or the years afterwards, all of a sudden I think I kind of need these games.
12044179	12045800	But that's how they get people.
12046040	12046281	I mean...
12046921	12052222	You know, this happens in our culture all the time, is that people want to see that they're getting a good deal.
12052302	12055083	Like, for example, look at all the hilarity that happened on Black Friday.
12055423	12066585	I'm sure everybody here saw the video, Derek, I'm assuming you probably saw this too, of the people at Walmart that were practically jumping on top of each other and clawing each other's eye outs over $2 waffle irons.
12067105	12070706	And it's like, who really needs a waffle iron?
12070966	12073987	How many days out of the year do you make waffles at home?
12074347	12074467	Yeah.
12074887	12076168	Yourself, you know?
12076408	12078790	How many days last year did you make waffles?
12079330	12081112	Well, I have a friend that makes waffles.
12081472	12081972	But not you.
12082152	12082613	Weekly.
12083013	12084434	You make waffles weekly?
12085655	12089157	I... Would you trust a $2 waffle iron to make waffles?
12089618	12090138	Exactly.
12090198	12092300	Unless it was a recognized brand and a Rudolph.
12092320	12096543	But why do people want to kill each other over a $2 waffle iron?
12096603	12096963	Because it's $2.
12097023	12100606	If you waffle that much, then you don't want waffles from a $2 waffle iron.
12100626	12100806	Okay.
12103916	12117345	We won a waffle iron at a white elephant exchange and Alan actually tried to make waffles with it and he got so frustrated he was cussing at this cheap white elephant waffle maker that makes little circus animal waffles.
12118464	12122046	But anyway, sorry, I'm totally going on a tangent.
12122106	12123087	But you know what I mean.
12123107	12126629	In our culture, people want to get things just because it's a good deal.
12126869	12130551	Okay, so Becky just messaged me and says, I make waffles at least twice a month.
12131351	12133533	But Becky is also a great cook.
12133833	12135354	Yeah, she has a really good waffle iron.
12135534	12136934	I wouldn't be surprised at all.
12136955	12140296	She probably has a lot of great cooking things that most people don't have.
12143452	12145574	Alan, you look like you're dying to say something over there.
12146295	12167973	I'm too lazy to look it up, but there's actually a clinical term culturally for when in times of financial hardship, like when the economy's in a shitter, just when people are broke, they'll go to the gas station when they fill up their car with a tank of gas and they'll buy a candy bar and they're not even hungry, but it's just an 89 cent thing that makes them feel good that they bought this little...
12169194	12193026	this little thing that just makes them feel better because it's cheap and Steam is a great outlet for that impulse that we have where I need to buy something, I'm tired of being broke or this is only a dollar so who fucking cares Retail therapy, really, I mean, in the end So you're saying I bought Wings of Prey because I'm clinically depressed is what you're saying?
12195376	12200308	I don't think it's quite that.
12201530	12204678	I don't think we could make that conclusion here on the show.
12207013	12209155	People are just driven if something is cheap.
12211176	12216098	Sometimes it feels good to spend a little bit of money, even if it's something that you know that you ultimately won't.
12216499	12221762	I know I do it all the time, but yeah, if you make something cheap enough, people will buy it whether they want it or not.
12222042	12230447	Maybe it would be a good policy moving forward for people, before you buy a Steam game, you need to walk away for an hour.
12230467	12230987	Yeah.
12231764	12235407	and then say after an hour, okay, do I still really want that game?
12235447	12236828	And if the answer is yes, then you buy it.
12237308	12239429	You can't do it because they have that countdown on the screen.
12239529	12240790	The number's going down.
12241731	12243492	What if I only have 57 minutes?
12243572	12247055	Why do you think I just bought Bastion at the start of the show?
12247890	12267498	and I even told you I said wait till you get home click done bitch alright Derek good luck with your Steam I don't want to say addiction but your Steam issues we'll say and hey at least I hope you're getting to play some great games out of it even if just for 20 minutes
12269045	12271266	I'm gonna go play VVV right after the show
12282049	12286212	Oh, the big battles, the multi-community gaming tournament.
12286892	12297059	You should do it because gaming is about having fun, and you have more fun, I believe, when you're competing, and even more fun when you're competing for something you enjoy.
12298440	12305205	Basically, you get to represent your favorite podcast or whatever and say, hey, we're the best.
12306192	12307413	Mortal Kombat players.
12307673	12308793	And it's not even we're the best.
12309053	12314015	It's not really you're the best, but it's something you can hold up over somebody else's head.
12314055	12314555	It's kind of nice.
12315376	12318297	It's always fun when you can compete against your friends.
12318757	12320078	And also you get to meet new people.
12320778	12322559	You get to play against people you probably wouldn't have.
12322639	12325840	You've been playing games against the same 20 people for the last four years.
12325860	12328761	Now you get to play against some other people who share the same interests as you.
12328881	12329442	It's a good thing.
12329582	12330162	The big battle done.
12330442	12331123	I think it's great.
12332185	12332926	I signed up to play.
12333086	12335009	I'm not signing up because I'm not going to win.
12335229	12335950	Who are we kidding here?
12335990	12337813	I'll probably get knocked out the first round.
12338734	12341438	I may not be the best, but I can be the loudest.
12342543	12370892	I think for the Mortal Kombat ones the ringers are the guys from Spooky Hour Horror Hour who love not only horror games but like everything about horror so they live and breathe Mortal Kombat so I think they're probably going to be the winners there but you know what it's good to take to like throw a knife in Tedekin's throat every couple of days that'll be fun alright well Derek I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show but thank you so much for the call
12371547	12373169	Thank you for doing a show so late tonight
12393650	12394591	We finished tweets.
12395331	12396311	Last minute stories.
12396532	12397932	Usually I turn to Loki for that.
12397992	12398593	He's not here.
12398953	12401074	I anticipate Alan probably didn't dig anything up.
12401154	12401654	I have one.
12402555	12407737	There's been a clarification about the Final Fantasy X HD remake that Squeenix announced in September.
12409578	12413020	I guess one of the developers or producers was asked for a timeline.
12413786	12422292	And he's like, just to make this clear, the Final Fantasy X remake isn't just a texture cleanup and a resolution upscaling.
12422972	12424233	It is a remake.
12424433	12427355	So redrawing of 10.
12428155	12432638	So redrawing of assets, cleaning up the script, new voiceover work.
12432778	12433699	It is the real deal.
12433819	12437641	So what everybody wanted from Final Fantasy 7... 10 is getting.
12438082	12438522	10 is getting.
12438642	12438882	Yes.
12439383	12439943	Let's just do 7.
12440003	12440183	Well...
12441864	12442665	How about do six?
12442785	12446167	So people thought... How about let's really remake a game?
12446207	12448089	Let's take one like six or four.
12448189	12450891	Well, four I guess got the DS remake, but six.
12451271	12453593	Six is begging for a really, really awesome remake.
12454114	12455154	So, interesting.
12455615	12456275	That just came out?
12456916	12458097	Yeah, story's dated today.
12458277	12458437	Wow.
12458868	12459809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12475151	12480234	I think a lot of that stuff got really out of control.
12480414	12482156	Was it a slow news week or what?
12485158	12490181	I think a lot of it's been discussed a lot and I don't know what else there is to add to that.
12490561	12496765	Two, I think Loki really wants to talk about it because he's actually used that controller that's at the core of it.
12497045	12510134	I think although it's important to distinguish between the individual that doesn't know how to deal with customers whatsoever and the device itself, Loki has used the device itself and really wanted to comment on it.
12510194	12513857	So I'm kind of pushing that back to next week so we can discuss that a little more.
12514237	12519781	So just so you know, I just wanted to say, yes, I'm aware that that happened in the gaming world this week, but at the same time,
12522443	12522743	I don't know.
12522763	12524164	I might get shit for this, but whatever.
12524724	12526686	It's not really gaming news.
12527046	12540757	It's gaming community news and gaming community events, and I get why people are following it, but it's just horrible train wreck, Rikki Lake holding her hand against the face with the jaw dropped, all that stuff.
12540997	12541097	So...
12542498	12544340	I can't believe you just made a Ricky Lake reference.
12544580	12545160	Go Ricky.
12545420	12545961	Go Ricky.
12546241	12546541	All right.
12547742	12553427	I will say, though, since Derek had just called in, Dead Pixel Live actually got the guy on the show.
12554427	12556289	And from what I understand, he apologized.
12556569	12559992	So at that token, what else is there to say if he's apologized?
12560032	12564916	But I also kind of think... I feel bad because I have no idea what this is about.
12565056	12565556	You know what?
12565636	12566517	I'll find out next week.
12566917	12569059	Or go listen to Dead Pixel Live show from Thursday.
12569139	12569739	It's interesting.
12569759	12570340	It's interesting.
12570600	12581369	The whole debacle is interesting, but at the same time, I think had this happened in November when Skyrim and all these things were coming out, it wouldn't have been as big of a thing.
12582390	12587895	They did a good job covering it in a more timely manner since they were able to get the guy on the day after it happened.
12588776	12591538	I don't know what we could contribute to that conversation.
12592319	12593440	It's been five days.
12593480	12594861	That's an eternity in internet time.
12595922	12596242	All right.
12597843	12598304	Let's see.
12600296	12602277	I think we're ready to wrap it up.
12602777	12607699	So we can't really wrap it up and put a bow on it and call it done until everybody has given their final thoughts.
12608060	12609480	So Alan, I'll start with you.
12609540	12612422	Thank you very much as always for filling in for a host who is not here.
12613422	12614142	Appreciate it.
12614402	12617844	And now that the show is in your house, maybe you'll stop by once in a while and say hello.
12618464	12624466	Yeah, or when Loki's here, I'll just play, you know, on the TV the whole time and ignore the show entirely.
12624566	12629028	When we get the video going, we can have you playing a game and, you know, kind of talk about that and we'll see.
12629228	12629348	Yeah.
12629508	12631428	So do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
12634750	12634870	No.
12635570	12635830	Okay.
12636950	12637570	Nothing to plug?
12637670	12637751	No.
12637811	12638171	All right.
12638371	12638691	Fair enough.
12640331	12648034	My final thought tonight is I haven't had Hanson's soda in a while, but now that I'm having this delicious black cherry soda, I've kind of missed it.
12649246	12653312	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight I love reading the stories on unicornbooty.com
12656181	12656501	Nice.
12657922	12659062	Oh, I have another final thought.
12659843	12662764	Last night, New Year's Eve, we watched a lot of Adventure Time.
12663665	12664205	Is that what it's called?
12664225	12664725	Adventure Time?
12665546	12667147	Adventure Time with Finn and Jake.
12667167	12668507	Okay, that show is pretty fucking funny.
12668687	12669208	I will say that.
12669328	12669808	It's a good show.
12670248	12670888	Alright, that's it.
12671209	12671669	We're done.
12671769	12672669	We'll be back next week.
12672909	12677632	Loki will be back finally next week and we'll get his top three and plenty more gaming news.
12678012	12679173	You know, we're into a new year.
12680133	12684355	The news is going to start to come out as we get into the first quarter releases and E3 in the summer.
12686456	12690559	all towards another Clusterfucker releases in October, November of 2012 right before the world ends.
12691119	12692220	Have a wonderful week everybody.
12692280	12694342	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
12694362	12694642	Good night.
