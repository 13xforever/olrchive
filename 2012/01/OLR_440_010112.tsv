0	20360	Tonight, January 1st, 2012, DLC is finally coming to the 3DS, Valve says Half Life 3
20360	29920	rumors are just trolling and a fan remake of a computer game classic is released.
29920	35080	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35080	41820	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. It is episode number 440 for this January
41820	46160	1st, 2012. Really easy day to remember. My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you
46160	50360	over the next few hours to talk video games with my co-hosts, first off, the one, the
50360	56120	only, Jamie Summers. Or Dark Sakura, whatever you want to call her. How are you doing?
56120	64480	People get my name right. Bitter table for one. Not bitter. I'm judgmental. All right.
64480	67960	Also joining us tonight, not joining us tonight. Sadly, I know this might surprise some people,
67960	72040	but Tech Master Loki unfortunately had to cancel on tonight's show. Unfortunately. Well,
72040	76680	you know, you miss him with every fiber of your being. No, I miss him with everything
76680	81540	I throw. He had a family engagement. I mean, it is technically a holiday, New Year's Day.
81540	85520	And so sometimes there's family stuff, especially with the new baby he's got. So they've got
85520	89100	a family thing going on. So he's not here tonight. That baby is not as new as that baby
89100	94860	once was. He better, he better have the baby thing down. That baby's getting older just
94860	101000	like you and you, but joining us tonight as he tends to do when we need another host,
101000	106400	please welcome to the studio. Alan, how you doing Alan? Hello. How are you? This is all
106400	111400	happening in my house right now. I need to get out. Yes. Um, here's the deal. If we sound
111400	114400	a little different tonight, we're kind of having to just adjust some audio on the fly
114400	118540	and that's because we're in a new studio and we talked about this when we were last on,
118540	122440	we did not have a show last week because it was on December 25th, which is a big holiday
122440	128360	for some people. Uh, and the week before that though was our last show. And, um, w that
128360	133280	was the last show from studio dark Sakura or the fifth studio in OLR's history. Yes.
133280	138980	But tonight we are in a new studio at studio six and it's from Alan and I's place. Yep.
138980	147080	So what, what's your grammar? What should be Alan and my house? How about shut and up?
147080	152160	Uh, how about bite my butt? Anyhow, unfortunately I was really hoping to surprise everybody
152160	156300	with the return of a webcam tonight, but it was just a bit pricey and, and logistically
156300	160400	a pain in the butt to set up, but we are set up very similar to, for those who've been
160400	165260	listening a long time, I believe it was the third, no second studio we were in, which
165260	169360	was when Loki and I lived together. It was a while ago, right? We actually did the show
169360	172740	kind of in the dining room and then the living room. There was antics that always happen.
172740	176040	That's kind of a similar setup to what we have going on right now in this studio six.
176040	179540	So we're hoping at some point we can return the live streaming of games and stuff during
179540	184900	the show over one of them stream and video websites. We used to use Justin TV. I've done
184900	188200	stuff on Ustream. I don't know. I don't know which way we'd go. We'll figure that out when
188200	191720	we actually have video. I now have experience doing custom graphics for Justin for not for
191720	198940	Justin TV for a Ustream. So, Hey, yep. Awesome. I did them for you for Umlaut. All right.
198940	204480	Say hello to the chatters chat room dot orange lounge, excuse me, chat dot orange lounge
204480	208100	radio.com. I'm a little rusty after we got chat dot orange lounge radio.com is where
208100	213260	you can join us. Uh, if you want to talk live with us here on this new year's day and it
213260	218100	looks like we have a Bobby Black Wolf. Did he just join? How come Bobby could show up
218100	222020	for our show, but he couldn't be bothered to do his own show tonight. No, that's because
222020	226720	he likes our show better. As, as I said to the all games chatters, Bobby didn't want
226720	231000	to work. He just wanted to bang on the drum all day because he, that's a joke because
231000	236400	he does drumming. He does drumming stuff for the Atlanta Falcons. So my mother is calling
236400	239960	me on my cell phone right now. Like, doesn't she know I have a radio show on Sunday nights?
239960	244700	Doesn't she know? Maybe she's listening. Rob, what do you mean you moved the show to your
244700	251820	house? Rob, did that cost money? Rob, Rob. And you know, we are live of course, Sunday
251820	256760	nights, every Sunday night, even when it's new year's day at all games radio is the kind
256760	260260	and gracious network that allows us to steal their bandwidth no matter what studio we're
260260	265480	in. Www dot all games.com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern. Typically after the
265480	269240	Bobby Black Wolf show when he's, you know, not off drumming tonight after the show, our
269240	274240	nine cast, they had a jumbo episode cause they are usually on it for Pacific and they
274240	280820	went long. They had an extended edition. They like it long. That's right. So anyhow, um,
280820	284360	let's start off with some topics tonight. I thought we could talk a little bit about
284360	288160	some of the stuff we did yesterday on new year's eve. Now we didn't party together sadly.
288160	291640	Um, it just didn't work out that way, but we did spend the day together and one of the
291640	295520	things we did during new year's eve was we went to the flea market. That was awesome.
295520	302340	Except I didn't buy any fleas. I think I might've caught a couple, but the flea market is basically,
302340	304640	I don't know how to describe it for those that have never been. I imagine everybody's
304640	307660	been to one at some point in their town, but then some people might not live in places
307660	311560	big enough that have them. I don't know, but they're basically like gigantic garage sales.
311560	317480	Is that an accurate description? Alan? Well, yeah, I guess you could say that a lot of
317480	322520	the wares are new and handmade though. It's not all recycled junk, but I'd like to think
322520	329000	of it as a giant thrift store. Yeah. Yeah. That works. So huge farmer's market, probably
329000	332520	the biggest farmer's market I've ever seen. Yeah. The one here we have locally in the
332520	336620	Sacramento area is just gigantic. So, um, you know, one of the things that's fun to go shopping
336620	341120	for is produce and we have a blood oranges. So the other thing that's fun to go shopping
341120	344340	for is like video games cause like there's a lot of people that will bring out their
344340	350160	old shit. And even I saw like arcade machines for sale in some of the, um, junk and some
350160	355360	of the little like, um, side, they have like a side auction. It's weird. So in the side
355360	360840	auction they had, um, it's technically a different one. It's auction town. Yeah. So it's not
360840	367840	part of deniers where we went. Well, we saw burger time for $950 like a legit arcade cabinet
367840	371700	was in good shape. It was, it was pretty good for its age. Considering that game is from
371700	377800	what 82 maybe it was somewhere around there. 82, 83. Considering that game is like as old
377800	382840	as it is, that that machine was in beautiful condition. It was $950 and I was like, Alan,
382840	386560	did you see what was on the other side of the machine next to it? No. What was that?
386560	391440	A berserk in just as good condition. Wow. Like that's the old one with the little bouncing
391440	396840	ball, like the little happy face. Good times. But we did buy video games. At least I know
396840	401200	I bought video games. I bought Sing Star Queen, which I've talked about on the show before
401200	404080	that I wanted it, but I wasn't going to get it until it went on sale. Well, I guess I
404080	407120	forgot to get it amongst all the other video games that came out last year cause it was
407120	412480	a crazy year and I bought Sing Star Queen for eight bucks at the flea market. That was
412480	416200	awesome. And it was, it was, it was sealed. It might've been like resealed. Sometimes
416200	419240	the stuff at the flea market, like they've used the little machinery seal it, but it
419240	423920	worked fine. I played it the other day. Uh, and then I bought get this just because I
423920	428400	wanted it and it was in the box of half off stuff. We actually have a super Nintendo hooked
428400	432160	up that works and it's in good condition. I mean, it doesn't look like it's in good
432160	436160	condition cause the super Nintendo is like Brown, but it works. That's the important
436160	440780	thing. I bought clue for the super Nintendo. Remember the old ass board game. They made
440780	445540	a port of it on super Nintendo that was kind of like, it didn't play exactly like the board
445540	450160	game. Like it kind of put this logic puzzle twist on it where it would tell you like the
450160	454800	lead pipe was in the conservatory and you have to kind of like tie it all together.
454800	458920	So if, if Ms. Peacock was in the conservatory, then she must've had the lead pipe, you know,
458920	465320	that whole thing. So, um, yeah, good times. So it was cool to play retro games and a favorite
465320	468360	of mine was clue on the super Nintendo for no particular reason. It wasn't really that
468360	473120	great of a game, but it's, you know, one I remember. So dark soccer. What did you, did
473120	478400	you pick up any games? I did. I got one game. I got moral combat, the new one on PS three.
478400	482800	Nice because Dan was complaining about not having any more PS three games. So, um, I
482800	485960	got the form. We didn't play it yet. I mean, I know later on we're probably going to do
485960	490640	our, how was our gaming week? Of course we always do. Yes. Um, but I picked that up and
490640	499080	I got blood oranges and D and um, dried pineapple and you bought a shit ton of tortillas. I
499080	504280	did. And we ate them all last night. Oh my God. That tortilla lady took you to the cleaners.
504280	510360	You bought like two for three. That's not bad. Two bags. And there were six in each.
510360	514720	So what I did, I did what she suggested with the, I got pumpkin tortillas, which were amazing
514720	518160	because pumpkin, everything is awesome. You know, it would be OLR if we didn't have a
518160	522800	food tangent, but I wrapped vanilla ice cream and then rolled them up and put them in the
522800	526580	freezer and chopped and sliced them. Oh my God. That sounds good. They were amazing.
526580	532320	They were gone. They vanished. And then I made, um, uh, black bean and cheddar quesadillas
532320	537780	with and the, the tortillas were black bean and garlic and they vanished like they didn't
537780	541980	last 15 minutes. So I'm just, I've decided we need to make flea market shopping a regular
541980	546720	thing because like we have a super Nintendo and I think, I think Alan has secretly not
546720	550080	so secretly, cause I'm about to share it on the radio, express to me that he would like
550080	554240	to build a collection someday that rivals the vault.
554240	559320	I think you're projecting a little bit, a little bit. Well, the thing is, is that I
559320	563320	had a lot of amazing super Nintendo games with the box and instruction booklet and they
563320	567300	were all in perfect shape cause I treat my stuff very well. I, they've all been sold
567300	572200	on eBay years and years ago for a lot of money and I was kind of reminded actually of the
572200	576200	price of how some of those games go for at the flea market. Cause there was a, was it,
576200	581400	was it the super nest luffia was like 80 bucks one for that cart. So yeah, there's still
581400	584880	some rare stuff out there. I used to have them, but I got rid of them. So you know,
584880	588880	you guys are welcome to borrow. If you have the wild hair to play anything, you're welcome
588880	592040	to borrow anything. I've got, I think most stuff on the super Nintendo, like I don't
592040	596520	know, like it's, it's really like I'll get a, just an, an urge to just play it. Like,
596520	600680	you know, I don't usually, I'm usually trying to play the new stuff cause you keep on top
600680	604700	of stuff. It's very rare that I'm like, Oh, I just, I want to go play clue on the super
604700	608360	Nintendo like, but when it's right in front of me, I go, I remember how cool this game
608360	613000	was. I needed, I need to just pick this up and take it home cause half off. I paid six
613000	617440	50 for it, which considering it was still in a box with the manual, I mean it wasn't
617440	622260	new obviously, but they, they shrunk rapid to make it look new, but you know, whatever,
622260	626400	you know, it was a good deal. So I was happy. Well, I've actually, it's funny that you mentioned
626400	630840	that cause I was thinking since Dan and I are a quest to play through every final fantasy
630840	638040	game in a row has a died. I was, how many did you get through? Not even one. We were
638040	643000	toward the end of what we just got. Um, when we last played the, everyone got their upgrades.
643000	650360	You got through final fantasy one, two, that's final fantasy half. Anyway, as something about
650360	656160	just starting off with six, sitting down and just jumped to the good stuff, going through
656160	660240	six, although I think four is amazing. So it's like four, don't get me wrong, but six
660240	663840	is one that, you know, we'll, we'll just take turns with because I know that game like the
663840	668260	back of my freaking hand, I've played through that game so many million times or chrono
668260	672480	trigger because then it's just a matter of new game plus. Let me go to our chat room
672480	676240	at chat.orangelaunchradio.com. Interesting kind of discussion going on in the chat room
676240	679680	tonight, kind of about the durability of consoles because I mentioned the super Nintendo and
679680	683480	the fact that, you know, it's still working and that led to some comments in chat room.
683480	688080	Uh, Yuki, I hope I'm saying that right in our chat room, uh, says my super Nintendo's
688080	693280	SNS is plural. Super Nintendo's never die. Those things are pretty durable and I thought
693280	697240	this is interesting. Kai's Judo kind of followed up a little later with the sad thing is 20
697240	701240	years from now, I doubt many people will say they have a PlayStation three or Xbox three
701240	707560	60 that still works. How true. I mean the old systems were quite durable, weren't they?
707560	711760	I mean, and they were all just hard plastic with a little green circuit board in it, right?
711760	717120	Many moving parts. I think Dan said that they had dropped a super Nintendo down two flights
717120	722360	of stairs and it still worked when he was a kid. Those things are rocks. I mean they
722360	727440	were, but yet an Xbox three 60, you're lucky to get one that never red rings. You knock
727440	734160	it over once onto the carpet and it's dead. That's true. They sure don't build them like
734160	737540	they used to, but of course a lot of that could be, to be fair, you know, we did make
737540	742560	a conversion somewhere along the way from CDs or excuse me, from cartridges to CDs,
742560	746920	therefore DVDs, therefore Blu-rays, you know, that was a pretty major shift in, you know,
746920	752880	format. Well, you can even see just in model releases, they go from being super sturdy,
752880	757880	like I have a first model PS3 and it's still in perfect condition. It still plays everything
757880	763220	wonderfully well, but then you get the newer ones, the slims, and they're just, they feel
763220	769800	like nothing. They've got no durability. They're missing options and they cost, you know, when
769800	773920	they were coming out, they were costing as much as the old models did. You know, I found
773920	777240	my Japanese PlayStation 2 the other day and we were cleaning up, setting up for the studio.
777240	780640	I found it and I kind of wanted to hook it up and play some old school BeatMania 2DX,
780640	785880	but the problem is like you, they don't work through component cables. All the styles before
785880	790320	I think 6 don't work through component cables. Like it just, no signal. This is the weirdest
790320	796000	thing. Yeah. Well, and by the way, I have something that I wanted to lend you. My keyboard
796000	800240	mania keyboard so you can do double. Oh, awesome. Cause I do have keyboard mania. I was going
800240	804040	to say if you wanted to hold onto it and do doubles, you're going to have to get out my
804040	807620	PlayStation 2 anyway. So yeah, flea market shopping. That's one of the things, fun things
807620	814840	we did. And I also, I saw in chat, act def says a friend shops on a flea market swap
814840	818840	meets and resells the stuff he finds on eBay for a living. I believe dark soccer was actually
818840	822680	talking to one of her friends there that she used to buy a lot of stuff from who said that
822680	826040	he doesn't have trader Dan trader and he doesn't have a really because he knows that if they
826040	830800	haggle with him, they're just trying to. Yeah. Remarket it on eBay. So that's exactly what
830800	835320	he said. And he's actually said he stopped dealing on eBay and he's doing like on E E
835320	839360	trader or something. Some website. Yeah. I caught that end of the conversation. He seemed
839360	844520	very irritated with eBay and Amazon. I'm not sure what happened there. I mean, Amazon,
844520	851360	he used to just completely resell every everything, all the good stuff on, on eBay. Well then
851360	855440	didn't Amazon kick everyone in California out because the whole tax thing, I don't know.
855440	861640	I think they did. I don't think he did Amazon. I think he was strictly eBay and Yahoo. Hmm.
861640	865960	Very interesting. All right. Um, I, I like this comparison. Very interesting comparison.
865960	869680	Then we'll move on with how was your gaming week here in the chat room, uh, from SEP,
869680	875760	win, uh, CEP win in the chat, a chat.org.com says it's like buildings. Do you think the
875760	881760	biggest NFL stadiums will be around a hundred years from now, let alone 2000 as the Roman
881760	890280	Colosseum? Well, here's an example. Um, I'm sure I've made no thing. I'm from mobile Alabama.
890280	896060	We have a building that was recently restored that was built in like 1850 something. Um,
896060	904640	you know, maybe after the city was like 150 years old and um, it's still in, even when
904640	910880	it was run down, it was still in sturdy condition and lived through years of hurricanes, a hundred
910880	915020	years worth of hurricanes where we had, you know, some of the newer buildings had been
915020	920960	flooded down and were corroded and everything. So just even as an example in a couple hundred
920960	925880	years, you know, construction, we're, we're leaning towards cheaper things that they don't
925880	929160	last. Well, a lot of stuff is built for the environment too. Like here in California,
929160	934000	you don't have brick buildings because of earthquakes. Yeah. So, but, um, in Alabama
934000	938380	you almost everything is made out of brick and concrete. It's just interesting. And buildings
938380	946320	are cheaper there, ironically, even though they'll last through probably more hard weather
946320	949700	than California sees. It's also part of the reason why San Francisco buildings are very
949700	953280	unique and you don't see buildings like it anywhere else is because San Francisco's weather
953280	958220	and layout for a town is really unlike anyone else. Like the Hills in San Francisco are
958220	962840	crazy and just, you know, anyhow, I don't know how we got from video games to that,
962840	967040	but whatever. Well, construction. Yeah. Alan, did you, you didn't end up buying anything
967040	971480	at the flea market, but anything catch your eye that like if you, you know, had the money
971480	977760	burning a hole in your pocket, you wanted a trader. Dan had a lot of, um, big promotional
977760	982840	standee things. Like he had that big Samus super Metroid thing that was like six or seven
982840	986000	feet tall from super Metroid. Oh yeah. You know, I wanted that for the new studio. It's
986000	990480	probably not for sale cause he has a mounted way up high on the wall. Yeah. But uh, yeah,
990480	995920	I don't know. He'd sell almost anything if you offer him the right amount. So, well no,
995920	1000400	cause we've bought some stuff that was just on the collection wall before. So, but that
1000400	1003600	was back when he had the store in Rio Linda. Well, you know, we put some pictures of the
1003600	1006740	new studio up at orange launch radio.com. There's a little picture bar towards the top
1006740	1010600	of the screen and you can kind of see some pictures that we take. I know what the website
1010600	1013800	says. You can send in your own pictures, but due to some abuse things we had happen a couple
1013800	1017080	of months ago, we had to pull that. So it's only the hosts really that are adding stuff
1017080	1021920	to that. And we just added a bunch of pictures from the studio. So there's, you know, you
1021920	1025280	can see the scrolls and things like that. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. But it was funny
1025280	1031600	looking at the flea market at the big collections of uh, the game gear and the Atari links at
1031600	1036940	both the console and the cartridge. How did anyone ever try to market that as portable?
1036940	1042300	Either system. They were both huge. Well look at an old school Gameboy. Remember the commercial
1042300	1046320	with the guy sitting on the toilet playing the links? Yeah. And I had a game gear and
1046320	1050880	I remember it, it went through four double A batteries probably every 72 hours. And it's
1050880	1055360	like worst battery life than a 3d. It weighs four pounds. Like how is that ever? But yeah,
1055360	1058700	that was, it was, it was neat seeing all of that really old hardware. Go look at an old
1058700	1063200	school Gameboy. Like those things are fucking bricks. But I remember you would have the
1063200	1067520	case for it. Now we put it in a backpack and take it to school and that it was portable.
1067520	1072280	You know, back then had an inspiration, Rob. What? You know how the people built the house
1072280	1078300	out of Legos? Like an entire house. Yeah. Damn. Well it was, it was a sort of like an
1078300	1083240	installation art piece, but you can actually pay to stay in it. Um, I want, I just had
1083240	1090020	a picture of the laptop, by the way. Um, I want to build a house out of Gameboys.
1090020	1096360	It might be tricky. An entire house. You might be able, you might be able to get a doggy
1096360	1101400	house. Well, you know, like maybe like a little office or a storage room or something, but
1101400	1108120	I think that, or even just do a wall, a wall of Gameboys, like modern art piece. Yeah.
1108120	1113400	Instead of, you know, the eight bit, uh, gaming exhibit that they do, you know, instead of
1113400	1120680	tile, you know, with, uh, the plaster tile plaster, do plaster and Gameboys. All right,
1120680	1124320	let's move on. We got to talk about our gaming week or two weeks. Uh, it may be, we always
1124320	1127880	like to, uh, at the top of the show or near it, uh, talk about the video games that we
1127880	1133300	have been playing this week. Dark Sakura. Uh, how was your gaming week? Wow. Lots of
1133300	1139920	world of Warcraft. Actually, not a lot because my computer was off for close to a week and
1139920	1143000	then we just got our cable back. Well, yeah, you had new interwebs for like four days.
1143000	1148800	I had to come over here on Christmas day. I remember that. To get my damn merry maker
1148800	1152440	achievement. Open presents under the tree and iron forge. Yes, I remember that because
1152440	1155960	then we went out, we went, we went out for, you know, nothing's open on Christmas, but
1155960	1160680	we were able to find that pho was open on Christmas. So I, as, as a proper Jew, I had
1160680	1165680	Asian food on Christmas day, even if it wasn't Chinese. I remember putting a tweet or something.
1165680	1169720	I was like two gays and a Jew walk into a pho bar on Christmas. Yeah, it was, it was
1169720	1174760	delicious. Yeah, it was very good. Delicious. And um, I played, well, once everything got
1174760	1181600	hooked up, I played a little bit of, um, fractal, which I, I really like that game. Yeah. You
1181600	1186120	talked about that last week on the show or two weeks. Yeah. Very pretty. And um, we played
1186120	1190720	rock band of course. Um, like we do every party that we have the quintessential party
1190720	1196040	game. Yes. And Bradley came over. Oh, Arcadia 42. Yes. We need to get him over here in the
1196040	1201060	new studio and he, um, brought symbols and then he proceeded to impress, uh, the cousins
1201060	1209640	with his prowess in pro drum mode. Oh, he does the pro drumming. Very cool. And, um,
1209640	1214540	we had a, well, when I left the house, Dan was watching a play through of Gradius on
1214540	1220360	the, uh, game boy, like the old school Gradius on the game boy. Cause I saw a little Moai
1220360	1227380	heads. Um, we did, um, I think we did have a little bit of proteus going on in the house.
1227380	1233120	So that was fun. But mostly it was just putting up games. So I've probably touched, uh, a
1233120	1238460	couple thousand games this weekend, literally touched them. Right. But as for playing them,
1238460	1241160	that's a different story. And then there's also the flea market games that you touch.
1241160	1245680	You put your paws on a lot of those too, digging through that. So yeah, I, I really did try
1245680	1250640	to, is sad going to trader dance though, because the stuff that he had out, the stuff I would
1250640	1255680	have wanted was a stuff I already have. So I'm like, well see, that's why I was asking,
1255680	1261640	you know, who had, um, master system, a master system because we have spare games. We do
1261640	1265320	literally have spare master system games, which by the way, any of our listeners, if
1265320	1271920	you have a master system, send me a photo of your master system. And the first person
1271920	1276320	that sends me a picture of their own personal master system will get a game. Where can they
1276320	1280560	email that? Cause you don't have an OLR email email bag at orange.radio.com show email.
1280560	1286720	All right. Mail the mail, the mailbag. And it has to be your master system. Don't Google
1286720	1290240	the picture. Maybe, maybe they need to put the, you need to tell them to put a little
1290240	1294280	post it note that says OLR. So we know they didn't like Google it. OLR put it has to have
1294280	1298760	a post note and, and keep in mind, I'm a designer. I can tell if you photoshopped it or something,
1298760	1302720	you know, if you don't have posted notes for sake, just scribble it on a notepad or something.
1302720	1307880	And maybe I'll be kind enough. And if you've got a power base converter, I'll accept that
1307880	1315040	as well. All right. Anyhow, uh, inadvertent contest here on the show. Uh, Alan, why don't
1315040	1319920	you go next? No Loki tonight. So it's been several months since I've been on OLR. So
1319920	1325640	I've actually completed a lot of games. Um, if you remember dragon age origins that came
1325640	1331040	out in 2009, a couple of months ago, I fired that up and I just couldn't let it go. I,
1331040	1336040	between that and the expansion awakenings, I completed both of those. Um, I think I've
1336040	1340640	logged nearly a hundred hours on my Archer ranger rogue that I rolled. I never realized
1340640	1344440	you finished awakenings. Like I saw that you moved on to dragon age two at one point and
1344440	1347560	I was like, Oh, maybe he just finally got ADD and he was like, I gotta go play the sequel.
1347560	1352780	I didn't realize you finished awakening. I used a pretty much with any RPG. Now I use
1352780	1356400	a FAQ or a walkthrough to play it just because I'm old and lazy and I don't want to miss
1356400	1361440	things the first way through. There's something secret. So yeah, I used facts. Um, dragon
1361440	1367200	age oranges was about 70 hours and awakenings was about 24 hours before I beat it. Um, see
1367200	1373160	I played a little dragon age two, which got derailed by Skyrim cause steam had Skyrim
1373160	1378320	for 40 bucks for 24 hours during its holiday sale, which for the game that a lot are calling
1378320	1381980	game of the year that just came out a couple of months ago is a steal. Yeah. So 40 bucks
1381980	1387960	for Skyrim, which I'm still, is what I'm actively playing. Um, just a PSA, the live listeners,
1387960	1392200	the Encore sales going on today and that is 40 bucks again. They brought Skyrim back for
1392200	1395800	40 bucks. That'll be, that'll be it like 10 AM tomorrow. It's gone. If you're listening
1395800	1399480	to this on the podcast, you probably missed it already. Yeah. Well then the nice thing
1399480	1403360	about studio six being in my house is that the podcast will be up like 30 minutes after
1403360	1408280	the show's done. So especially the folks overseas, but I don't think the overseas folks can get
1408280	1412800	the steam sales. I'm not sure. How does that work? Do you know dark soccer? I really don't
1412800	1416360	know. I'll have to ask. I'm curious if the folks, do we have any chatter? I'm going to
1416360	1421000	have to go home now and check my steam. I can't do it during the show unless there's
1421000	1427300	steam for Linux now. I don't know. Uh, I'm here. Yeah. Did the folks in chat know is
1427300	1433040	do we have any, I see Aki ripper in chat. I get ripper. Can you steam Sweden close enough?
1433040	1436860	You might be able to log into the steam website and buy something on the website on your account
1436860	1440040	and then it'll download to the client. Just wait till you get home until 10 AM tomorrow.
1440040	1444480	But um, yeah, so I'm kind of juggling dragon H two and Skyrim right now and those are both
1444480	1450080	pretty meaty meals of a game. So I don't know how long I'm going to be able to juggle those
1450080	1457160	two. I got a DSI XL for Christmas for my lovely, kind, generous boyfriend and studio. Um, and
1457160	1462820	because of my DSI XL, I've been playing warrior where touched. Can we back up a minute? Because
1462820	1465480	this certainly caught me off guard. Cause I asked you, I said, what do you want for
1465480	1469520	Christmas? And you said you wanted a DSI XL. I'm like, you, you, you want that even though
1469520	1474240	it costs as much as a three ds. So just for the, for the listeners that might be asking
1474240	1479280	the same question, why an XL? Why now? You got to answer, well, you have a three ds and
1479280	1488360	I can play yours when you're at work. Honest answer. Um, that, and I have a thing, I almost
1488360	1494040	have a thing against Nintendo, but the first generation of their little hardware portables,
1494040	1499200	I thought the ds original, the ds fat was ugly and it looked cheap. And the ds light
1499200	1502320	was like, Oh, okay, this looks like a good device. That's when I finally got on board
1502320	1509260	with the ds was with the light. I just think with the weird analog stick on the right side
1509260	1515680	attachment that came out for the three ds, um, I'm just, I want the second generation.
1515680	1520360	And when I play Mario Kart seven on your three ds, I can only do two races before my right
1520360	1525740	hand is completely cramped. Cause I have a big giant spindly spidery man hands and it
1525740	1531920	hurts to play. So I have my giant ds XL and I've got a ton of ds games, RPGs that I haven't
1531920	1537320	played. So all right. Fair enough. Yeah. And now when you explain it to me, it made a lot
1537320	1540960	of sense. I was all right. And plus now, now that I've really got my pause on one of those,
1540960	1544760	it's a really nice device. It's a nice device. It's kind of a bummer. It was so late in the
1544760	1548200	life and now a lot of folks have moved on cause you know, it's a pretty rock solid ds.
1548200	1552800	I just want to take a step back for just a minute and a chat. Hers have clarified act
1552800	1560560	deft from Mexico steam sales work worldwide. There you go. So, um, so aside from Mario
1560560	1567560	are touched on the XL, I also did my sort of annual play through of half life and half
1567560	1572040	life to episodes one and two. I beat those from start to finish. This is, that's kind
1572040	1577880	of like your version of dark soccer is Christmas nights. I notice once or twice a year I just
1577880	1582880	get half life fever and I got to play through it. I just need to do half life to like that.
1582880	1586880	The proper half life too. I haven't done that yet. And some chatters and a chat might be
1586880	1590000	thinking about a story that happened in gaming news this week. And yes, we'll be talking
1590000	1595840	about that later. So bastions five bucks. That's a good game. Very good game. Lot of
1595840	1598420	a game of the year list. Speaking of game of the year list, I do want to get this out
1598420	1602740	at some point. Um, I know it's 2012 but since we didn't have a show last week and the way
1602740	1606600	timing worked out, we need to have a proper like end of the year kind of recap. So we
1606600	1610200	will be talking about our games of the year. Dark soccer myself and Alan have picked our
1610200	1613520	top three games of the year. We'll get Loki's next week guys. Don't worry when he's back.
1613520	1617000	Uh, but we want to hear your guys's game of the year picks too. So we have some posts
1617000	1621880	on Facebook and Google plus. So if you haven't chimed in yet, go do that. Cause we're going
1621880	1627160	to do that in part B and some of our picks might surprise you. So I know that there are
1627160	1631720	probably what, three games that everybody's picking. Well, we'll see. Maybe our lists
1631720	1634720	are the same three, maybe not, but I want to emphasize there's no right or wrong answers.
1634720	1639400	And I got to say, just looking at Facebook and Google plus, I'm really impressed at the
1639400	1644520	diversity of choices. I really truly don't think that just because every media outlet
1644520	1649040	says game A, B or C is the game of the year means everybody else is on board. Like I don't
1649040	1654000	think any two people have picked the same game. Very interesting. So anyway, sorry about
1654000	1659160	that. Uh, where were we? Your gaming week, Alan? I really think that that's it. I, uh,
1659160	1664360	as far as this week, I've scrambled around on the steam contest for the holiday sale
1664360	1672240	where you unlock Steve achievements to earn coupons. Um, also I have two coupons for 50
1672240	1676320	percent off any valve game. Good through, I think the first of March if an all our listener
1676320	1680520	wants to add me on steam, I'll trade them that coupon. We should have an OLR group on
1680520	1685280	steam that they could find you on. So I played psycho knots for about an hour and a half
1685280	1692000	to be able to use my mind power that, um, pyromania to burn two squirrels because there
1692000	1697040	was an achievement for cooking two critters. So I played some games like super meat boy
1697040	1701960	has one yesterday that I need to go through. So that's all I know you're doing that too.
1701960	1705140	So if you want to find us on steam or any of that stuff, um, this, it's awesome on orange
1705140	1709240	launch radio.com and the upper right hand corner is this little box that says extended
1709240	1713480	play and you'll see all the logos for like all the community social networking websites
1713480	1717960	and you'll see the steam logo on there and you can join the OLR clan and you can say
1717960	1724240	hi to Alan or salacious pop and he'll give you treats. It sounds like maybe, maybe he
1724240	1729600	may not have enough for everybody. Um, my gaming week, um, I've played a lot of hodgepodge
1729600	1733440	kind of stuff. Like I mentioned before, I bought seeing star queen clue, but there's
1733440	1738200	probably two games primarily I've been playing. Um, you know, kind of focusing on the past
1738200	1743360	couple of weeks. Uh, first one I'll mention is on the three DS, um, a port of one of my
1743360	1747560	favorite games that I played for the first time last year, even though the game is actually
1747560	1753000	a couple of years old itself. Uh, VVVVVV came out for the three DS it's on the three
1753000	1758360	DS shop. I mean literally like just last week. Uh, and you know, it's, it's a very faithful
1758360	1763660	port of the version that's on the PC. You don't have the level editor, although they're
1763660	1769000	saying that that may be coming in the future, but you do have some like best of user created
1769000	1773680	levels, which is pretty cool. And of course the games in three D a little bit. I mean,
1773680	1778260	it's not complicated three D it's kind of like the NES classics. It's like, like three
1778260	1785260	different layers of three D kind of see things on. Um, but the game itself, VVVVV is a great
1785260	1790120	game and excellent game. Some folks may find it to be a little bit short, but I think it's
1790120	1795560	well worth it for the $8 kick ass soundtrack. It's kind of very similar to super Metroid,
1795560	1799840	very easy gimmick, uh, the whole gravity flipping thing, but it works so well. I mean, it's
1799840	1803880	a, it's a great game. It's, it's great. And of course as somebody who loved Commodore
1803880	1808960	64 and really grew up on Commodore 64, I love that the game has a lot of, you know, kind
1808960	1814560	of tips of the hat to the Commodore 64 days, including the loading screen. So I thought,
1814560	1818960	I think the three DS version is a worthy port. I realize some people may have a hard time
1818960	1825200	justifying, well, I just bought VVVV as part of the humble indie bundle that was just out
1825200	1830660	because it was one of the games from the third that came back and I paid five bucks for likes,
1830660	1836620	you know, 15 games that included VVVV. Why would I go pay $7 in the three DS shop now?
1836620	1841120	That's a damn good question. Maybe it's not worth it in that regard. But for me, I love
1841120	1844480	the idea of having a portable version. You know, sometimes you just want games to be
1844480	1849920	able to have wherever you are, airport, you know, commuting or whatever it is that you're
1849920	1855640	doing, you know, out and about, it's sometimes nice to have some games to go and VVVV is
1855640	1861440	a worthy addition to the three DS lineup. Um, let's see. Otherwise, the other game that
1861440	1869440	I spent a huge chunk of time playing is Star Wars, the Old Republic, the new MMO, uh, that's
1869440	1876560	out from BioWare and EA. I did pick this up, uh, the 21st, the day after it was out. And
1876560	1881620	I've spent a good part of the past couple weeks playing it. I have like four characters
1881620	1886440	in the level 10-ish range, two of them Imperial and two of them Empire. So I've gotten a good
1886440	1893160	feel, especially for the introduction parts of the game. Um, this, God, where do I even
1893160	1898840	begin with this? A lot of people are comparing it to WoW. And I got to say this comment first.
1898840	1903800	I, I'm really amazed with how pressed some of the Star Wars players are when it comes
1903800	1909640	to WoW because the general chat half the time is nothing but talk about, oh, this game is
1909640	1914200	so much better than WoW. And, oh, this game, oh, this game just kicks WoW's ass. And, oh,
1914200	1917680	WoW is a kiddie game. And you know, they're just bringing pandas cause it's a kiddie game.
1917680	1922160	I used to play WoW, but it sucks now. And it's like, wow, you guys hate WoW so much.
1922160	1928800	You can't stop talking about it. But that's not really a slam on Star Wars. That's just
1928800	1933400	a slam on the chat community. I was comparing it to Star Trek Online. Let, well, here's
1933400	1940080	my point. Let both games just be, because does Star Wars have a lot of inspiration from
1940080	1944400	WoW? Sure. One of the classes I was playing, I was laughing cause I'm like, this place
1944400	1948620	is just like a warrior. It even has a talent called Sunder and you build up rage. I'm like,
1948620	1955540	this is like, just like a WoW warrior. But at the same time, the questing in Star Wars,
1955540	1960860	The Old Republic, is so immersive. Like, you know, the voice acting really adds a neat
1960860	1966200	element to it. Of course, the whole Bioware touch of the conversation trees, the fact
1966200	1971680	that you can have your character be light side or dark side, even within the Empire
1971680	1976480	or Imperial. Like, you can be a bad Jedi or you can be a good Sith. It's really funky
1976480	1980840	how that works, but I like that. And the group conversation is really interesting too. I've
1980840	1987080	been playing the game a lot with Shane. And, like, we will both kind of go out and quest
1987080	1991960	together and he likes to have his person be good and I like to have mine be bad. So, it's
1991960	1995360	kind of funny watching that struggle and you get to see kind of different outcomes and
1995360	2001000	all that. So, it's neat. I wanted to finish my thought really, really quick though on
2001000	2007080	the whole, like, pressed Star Wars people and WoW. WoW obviously got its inspiration
2007080	2010960	from other games too and that's important to say. Like, I think Star Wars is just this
2010960	2016520	company's evolution of the MMO genre. And the question is, does it work? And my answer
2016520	2023840	is, in most places yes, but in a few places no. And I think any MMO is going to have this
2023840	2028000	problem when it first comes out and that's kind of about finding the balance. And I think
2028000	2031520	that's where the game has its trickiest part right now is balance and a lot of that has
2031520	2038300	to do with the economy. The economy is really clouded, uncertain right now and it's really
2038300	2042920	hard to make money and they just nerfed one of the big professions for that and so a lot
2042920	2047400	of that needs some fine tuning. But, you know, the game's only been out two weeks. For an
2047400	2051800	MMO that's hardly anything, I'm sure a lot of that will be fixed in time. But the other
2051800	2055440	thing I've got to knock Star Wars for because this is something I keep saying, like, every
2055440	2060480	time I'm playing the game, damn, I wish they would fix this. One of the reasons I love
2060480	2066040	WoW is the community and the UIs that they've built and Star Wars desperately needs to open
2066040	2071120	it up and let users make their own UIs and interfaces and add-ons, especially for things
2071120	2075600	like the auction house, especially for things like targeting and things of that sort. Because
2075600	2080860	if you have two people and their companions out, healing is kind of a pain in the butt.
2080860	2086560	So I'd like to see some UI changes for that and just some of the ways things are set up
2086560	2092000	are a little weird and I just think the community could improve on that a little bit. But, it's,
2092000	2099320	I mean, especially compared to, I played Riff when it first came out. I played Warhammer
2099320	2102600	when it first came out. I played, you know, I've played a lot of the Ion. I played Ion
2102600	2106320	when it first came out. I played a lot of the other ones. And this is really the first
2106320	2112660	one where I was like, wow, this really is something different. This is a neat experience.
2112660	2117720	This, you know, I like the story, which is weird because I'm not even that big on the
2117720	2123320	Star Wars movies. Like, you know, I appreciate them. I understand why there's fandom for
2123320	2128240	the old movies from the 70s at least, not the new ones. But, you know, I get, you know,
2128240	2131520	I get why Star Wars is popular, but I found myself really getting kind of sucked into
2131520	2136000	the story and it's really interesting. And I really liked getting to kind of, you know,
2136000	2142160	play this character that could be light or dark or neutral or what have you. So the biggest
2142160	2148960	strengths are in the fact that every single player game element is great. And you could
2148960	2153840	go from 0 to 50 single player, no problem. I think it really helps when MMOs have the
2153840	2159080	mythology pre-built to then bring in. Because Lord of the Rings Online, obviously, Lord
2159080	2166740	of the Rings is, you know, significantly huge. You know, it's been around for 50, 60 years.
2166740	2170440	Star Wars Galaxies, I guess, was a bad game, but that also had the Star Wars mythos to
2170440	2177600	bring with it. Well, hold on. World of Warcraft had WoW or Warcraft Orcs vs. Humans 1, 2,
2177600	2182280	and 3 and Blizzard put in a shitload of lore. I was going to say quickly, Star Wars Galaxies
2182280	2187540	wasn't necessarily a bad game. It was a game that made bad decisions. Well, yeah, because
2187540	2192600	they, yeah, they switched it up to make more, make it more accessible in all the diehard
2192600	2196880	people. Right. Don't alienate your primary fan base. It's something, it's where, that's
2196880	2204300	where WoW is that a, because for some people, Cataclysm was the equivalent of the NXC. And,
2204300	2207360	you know, so anyway, or New User, what did they call it? New User Experience, whatever
2207360	2212920	it was called. Anyway. But because Bioware doesn't as of yet have a good MMO pedigree,
2212920	2217240	they do have a great game pedigree. I mean, it's Bioware, so I didn't really have any
2217240	2224440	doubt in my mind that the Old Republic was going to be bad as just a campaign experience.
2224440	2228480	But a lot of people are wondering when, once you get to level 50, are there, I mean, are
2228480	2233320	there raids? Like what do you do once you're at max level? Apparently there are, there
2233320	2236840	are operations, I think they're called, which are the equivalent of raids, I believe. And
2236840	2241020	there's PVP. You can do PVP at level 10 and all that. But that's a good question. I'm
2241020	2244440	not really sure. I'm sitting here as somebody who's been playing the game for two weeks
2244440	2250480	and I'm not really sure. Because with Rift, Rift was a completely new property. They had
2250480	2253920	to do all that world building about the conflict and there's this race and this race and blah,
2253920	2259200	blah, blah and why these big portals are opening up in the sky. All the time. All the time,
2259200	2264360	which is a different problem altogether. And it was just hard to really invest myself in
2264360	2270720	the world that I was playing in. Whereas with Star Wars and WoW, you have the mythology
2270720	2274960	going back years and years that players already will play that. That's what brings people
2274960	2280220	to those games, I think. So to try to kind of try and wrap up, because I know I'm rambling
2280220	2284220	here a bit, but to kind of wrap up my thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic, I think it's
2284220	2288280	a good game. And if you're into MMOs, you'll probably want to pounce on this pretty quick
2288280	2293640	because, you know, a lot of people have been. But if you're not sure, I say wait. Because
2293640	2296840	I think the game's only going to get better with a little more maturity and age. And I
2296840	2302240	think in six months to a year when they really have a lot of players in end game and they
2302240	2307320	have a lot of this ironed out, I think the game's going to be very, very neat. Is it
2307320	2311560	a WoW killer? I don't know. I don't really like that term. Because I don't think, like
2311560	2316200	there's similar games out there all the time. You know, Burnout didn't kill Need for Speed
2316200	2321840	and you know, Call of Duty and Battlefield can compete. You know, it's just different.
2321840	2328480	And it's expensive if you want to play both games. That's the only bummer. But the games
2328480	2332000	can coexist. I don't think one necessarily has to cannibalize the other. I think there's
2332000	2335240	going to always be people that want to play WoW. And there's going to be people that don't
2335240	2338480	want to play WoW that want to play Star Wars. And you know, there's going to be people like
2338480	2344520	me that kind of want to play a little bit of both. So, there you go. Alan, I do want
2344520	2347820	to quickly ask you though, because you play a lot of MMOs. You've come on the other show
2347820	2352180	Horde House a lot to talk about WoW. You play a lot of WoW. You raid in WoW. You're an end
2352180	2356480	game raider. You're one of the tops of the server. But you don't seem to have that same
2356480	2363080	interest in Star Wars. Is that because of your investment in WoW? Is it a money thing?
2363080	2369880	Is it just being a hater? What is it? Well, I've dedicated myself to raiding with people
2369880	2378080	12 hours a week, which is a lot. And I am comfortable with that arrangement for right
2378080	2383760	now. Once I get a job, I will probably have to quit doing that. But it's a financial thing.
2383760	2391280	I've already staked my claim with my raiding guild in WoW. And yeah, I don't want to pay
2391280	2401120	15 bucks a month twice for that. I'm also on the year-long Diablo III Death Pact. So,
2401120	2405400	I've pretty much said, yes WoW, regardless of how bad you get or how lame your patches
2405400	2410000	are, I'm going to be sticking with you for a year. And I'm committed to that. I don't
2410000	2416480	really need Wandering Eyes for MMOs. Though I will say though, the reason why I decided
2416480	2424040	to start playing Dragon Age Origins until I beat it was the fact that aside from raiding,
2424040	2430140	I am kind of burned out on WoW. So that's helping my console gaming more. I've actually
2430140	2434440	been more into WoW than I have been in a WoW, which is really weird. I don't know if that's
2434440	2438260	just because I've had a lot of time off work, so I've had more time to play things. Or the
2438260	2444120	fact that I am loving Arcane Mage right now in Warcraft. But yeah, I'll play WoW for a
2444120	2448420	couple hours. I'll play Star Wars for a couple hours. Then I go back to playing WoW. That's
2448420	2453480	been a lot of my vacation when I'm not doing other more productive things. A lot of chatters
2453480	2458000	talking about Guild Wars 2. Kaijuto, I think, kicked it off. I cannot wait for Guild Wars
2458000	2463640	2. That's going to be my main MMO. And yeah, I gotta say, I'm really interested in Guild
2463640	2468980	Wars 2 as well. I'm hoping the payment model is the same as Guild Wars 1 where it's buy
2468980	2475000	the game and never pay money again. Would be great. Not have to pay a monthly fee or
2475000	2482880	whatever. Yeah, I'm looking forward to Guild Wars 2. That'll be another MMO I'm going to
2482880	2489400	have to somehow juggle. So we'll see. I kind of think in the long run, I may keep... It's
2489400	2493040	hard to say. I've been off work this whole time, so I've been able to juggle two MMOs.
2493040	2497880	But when I go back to work, I'm probably going to have to pick one or the other. And I've
2497880	2502080	agreed to play WoW for a year. I'm on the same thing where I've already signed the death
2502080	2506440	pact. I want to be, but I'm not. But I think even if I had to choose between the two, I
2506440	2510840	would choose WoW at this point. Because I think Star Wars will get better with age.
2510840	2514720	I didn't start... Think about it. I didn't start playing WoW until Burning Crusade expansion
2514720	2520800	came out. I started WoW with vanilla. And hated it. And hated it. And then I played
2520800	2525920	Burning Crusade and hated it. And then I didn't even bother with any of the other stuff because
2525920	2530900	I still hated it. And then Cataclysm came out and I was like, I kind of like this.
2530900	2536620	So does me saying, I don't want to maybe play Star Wars right now a bad thing? Not necessarily.
2536620	2541000	I mean, God, look at my WoW addiction. And that just took a couple years to grow. So
2541000	2545900	I think, I think, I think Star Wars will still be here in a year or two, unlike some of these
2545900	2549920	other MMOs that have come out. Like, is anyone still playing Age of Conan? Anybody?
2549920	2553560	It's not on the show role because I think it would have been for last week, but we didn't
2553560	2561360	do a Christmas show. Didn't Swotar or the Old Republic hit a million paid subscribers
2561360	2565840	the fastest out of even faster than WoW? Wasn't that a story? We're not covering it tonight,
2565840	2568080	but they put out a press release saying that they have a million.
2568080	2573000	I think they've sold like 1.5 million copies of the game globally. So that wouldn't surprise
2573000	2574200	me at all. They have that many.
2574200	2578080	Yeah. There's still two more, one or two more weeks before people start getting rebills.
2578080	2581640	So the rebuilds is when they're going to be able to say that they have subscribers.
2581640	2582640	Exactly.
2582640	2588200	So we'll see. We'll see. All right. Um, there is stuff going on besides MMOs in the world.
2588200	2591600	Quickly, some housekeeping and then we'll get into some news. Uh, I already mentioned
2591600	2594580	the game of the year. We're going to talk about in part B, so stay tuned. Get your picks
2594580	2598400	in at our Facebook or at our Google Plus page. And if you don't have us added on either of
2598400	2603440	those pages, maybe you should take care of that. Um, also I want to plug some other things
2603440	2607920	going on elsewhere. One of them that I really, really need to plug and make sure you guys
2607920	2613080	know about is something called the big battle. And this is something that Derek from dead
2613080	2616720	pixel live, which is another show on the all games network is kind of spearheading, but
2616720	2622120	it's a lot of, uh, community shows kind of all pitching in to try and make this thing
2622120	2627160	a success and get more people at the table wanting to kick each other's ass in a good
2627160	2630880	way though, because it's all about fighting games. Uh, the big battle this time is I think
2630880	2636640	the big beat down. Uh, and it's all fighting games. It's mortal combat, it's street fighter,
2636640	2641480	arcade edition, it's street fighter three, it's ultimate mortal combat three. It's all
2641480	2647200	these fighting games. Um, and we're trying to get as many people in to participate in
2647200	2653660	the tournament to find out which show has the best fighting game fans. Um, so far I'm
2653660	2657680	the only one signed up from OLR. So I'm hoping some of you will head on over to the big battle
2657680	2662040	dot net and change that sign up over there on the beat down board, uh, for one of the
2662040	2665120	games. Now the only kind of for some people deal breaker for some people is that it's
2665120	2669840	all xbox 360. So some of you have these on PS3. See, I have mortal combat and super street
2669840	2676200	fighter four on our PS3, so I couldn't sign up for those games. But yes, you can. What
2676200	2680280	do you mean you can come to my house? I guess I could, huh? Yes, you can. What does that
2680280	2685600	mean you're going to sign up to? Maybe I will. Ooh. Ooh. Well, there you go. Keep in mind,
2685600	2690440	this is gimpy hand lady. You know, if you have an arcade stick that you could use, right?
2690440	2697280	We have several arcade sticks. That won't be a problem. All right, so maybe, maybe we'll
2697280	2701640	work something out. But anyway, it's all an xbox 360. So super street fighter for arcade
2701640	2705780	edition, mortal combat, street fighter three, third strike online, ultimate mortal combat
2705780	2710840	three. Go sign up on the beat down board at the big battle dot net and say you're going
2710840	2715200	to represent the OL army or team OLR. Uh, they'll know what you're talking about. Go
2715200	2719320	sign up and uh, I'll kick your ass soon if you're playing ultimate mortal combat three
2719320	2722540	because that's the one of the games that I do own on the xbox 360, which I find funny
2722540	2725520	because you can't buy that game anymore. Yet that's the game that has the most signups
2725520	2732440	right now. I think people just love the classics. What else can you say? So go sign up. All
2732440	2738440	right. Um, other thing I got to plug here, the geek dash life awards. Um, you know, we've
2738440	2741640	talked about this website before and part of it is because you know, dark soccer is
2741640	2746700	like a rights for it. You still write for it? Yes, I do. It's just with the last semester
2746700	2752600	I slacked off on my writing. You know how busy I was. Well, the editors over there,
2752600	2756480	which I don't believe was stark Sakura cause I think there's gotta be rules against that.
2756480	2760440	But uh, the editors over there did nominate us as one of the best podcasts of the years
2760440	2765760	and the second annual geek life awards. Woo hoo. Um, but the funny thing is, um, another
2765760	2770360	podcast that was nominated was hoard house, my show about Warcraft right now in the poll
2770360	2774480	hoard house is beating orange launch radio for best podcast of the year. I'm sure extra
2774480	2779880	prayer had nothing to do at all with that, but if you want to go vote for hoard house
2779880	2783600	or you want to go vote for orange lounge radio, I'm going to post that website in chat right
2783600	2787140	now and you should go vote. Um, of course there are some other good shows nominated.
2787140	2790720	I'm not going to dog the competition. Maybe you want to go vote for cheap ass gamer, fear
2790720	2795160	the boot or battleship pretension, which are also nominated and find shows in their own
2795160	2798760	right. So you know what, if you really think they are the best show of the year, then go
2798760	2802880	vote for them. That's fine. Um, geek dash life. We just want to thank them. It's an
2802880	2807680	honor to be nominated, right? Dark Sakura. God, what are you going to do if you lose
2807680	2816480	to ex defer? I don't know. I guess talk about his bleached asshole. All right. Good answer.
2816480	2820140	All right. Speaking of hoard house, I should mention we haven't done a show for like two
2820140	2827800	weeks over there. Correlation bleacher asshole win an award. Do you want to find out? No.
2827800	2833800	Okay. Anyway, um, uh, I should say a hoard house hasn't had a show for like two weeks
2833800	2837800	and probably won't be back till next week. And that's just a timing thing on X for a
2837800	2842960	nice part. Like I'm going to be gone for four days next week. So yep. Good times. Busy,
2842960	2846120	busy, but Hey, it's the holidays so we can kind of get away with it. All right. Let's
2846120	2849680	talk about gaming news. Let's get back into what is going on in the gaming industry this
2849680	2854440	week. Not a lot come to find out, but there are some things going on. We do want to bring
2854440	2857920	to the table and talk about with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
2857920	2864020	Alan, start us off tonight. So Nintendo, they've been razzed on so hard, especially by the
2864020	2869880	gentlemen that I am subbing for tonight. Um, as far as their inability to embrace stuff
2869880	2876280	that other consoles are doing, particularly online supply, uh, online play, but they are
2876280	2882680	jumping on one bandwagon finally, and that is paid DLC. Um, is it true that the Wii didn't,
2882680	2887160	you couldn't patch games on the Wii, right? There were no, you cannot patch games on the
2887160	2892200	Wii. Um, and the proof of this would be what's going on with Skyward Sword. They actually
2892200	2896400	had to release this whole channel and it's there in the Wii shop. If you go look, one
2896400	2899880	of the games I forgot to mention, I played this week, I found I had extra points in my
2899880	2904200	Wii balance or Wii accounts. I went and bought blaster master for the NES on virtual console.
2904200	2909120	Woo. But as I was looking for the shop, I saw the fix your game file channel for Skyward
2909120	2912760	Sword and I was like, that has to be embarrassing. But yeah, they can't, they can't just patch
2912760	2917400	Skyward Sword to do it. They have to have a fix my game channel. So even with their
2917400	2923440	most, uh, up until the 3DS, they supplemental content, whether it be, um, to enhance the
2923440	2928200	product or to correct the product, they just never did it. Well, um, Nintendo with the
2928200	2933360	3DS are finally doing paid DLC and the first title that is going to get it is their new,
2933360	2938600	uh, Fire Emblem franchise. I know Fire Emblem has had some characters in Smash Brothers
2938600	2943600	for a while. It's not really that big of a franchise here, but I know a lot of the diehard
2943600	2948960	Nintendo fans know about Fire Emblem and it's going to cost several hundred yen. It's kind
2948960	2953440	of vague right now when it comes out. But yeah, you can expect, uh, you know, with the,
2953440	2958000	uh, online store that 3DS has where you can buy the old, you know, Game Boy Advance and,
2958000	2966440	um, the little, uh, the DSware games. Now when you buy a actual retail cart product,
2966440	2972760	you can eventually log in maybe either through the game or through your 3DS and buy bonus
2972760	2977640	campaigns for it, which is just money, money, money. I mean, look at Microsoft and Sony
2977640	2983300	and all the millions they've made with pay to unlock launch day DLC that's on the disc.
2983300	2989120	I should say this though. The Wii does have, the Wii does have kind of download content.
2989120	2995600	Um, like Rockband has it. One of the games, Final Fantasy IV, the after years, you could
2995600	3000240	download the extra chapters for a couple hundred Wii points each. So, I mean, Nintendo's done
3000240	3008240	DLC a little bit, but not a lot of bit. And I want to say everything that was DLC on the
3008240	3012360	Wii, I'm thinking, Chatter might correct me on this, but I want to say none of it was
3012360	3016120	Nintendo themselves. All of it was third party companies that were doing it because, you
3016120	3021320	know, Final Fantasy Square Enix, uh, Rockband is, you know, harmonics. So I don't think
3021320	3025000	any of it is coming from Nintendo themselves. So that's what makes us notable both that
3025000	3030720	A, it's the 3DS, which, you know, we haven't seen DLC on the 3DS yet. We've seen, you know,
3030720	3037240	buy the game, right? I just pimped VVVV, uh, but we haven't seen DLC and it's Nintendo
3037240	3042920	themselves now. That's a big deal. Yeah. So, so I stand corrected. Yeah. We did have the
3042920	3049800	facilities for DLC, but this one, um, you know, for a handheld definitely is interesting.
3049800	3055000	And the Wii U, they've also confirmed that it's going to have paid DLC, but there's still
3055000	3059120	a lot more we need to find out about the Wii U than just that. Um, some comments from our
3059120	3063660	chat room at chat.orangewonstrategy.com. Yuki says, and here I was respecting Nintendo for
3063660	3070280	not doing DLC till now. Tigerclaws theorizing, who knows, maybe a new Zelda quest via DLC.
3070280	3077160	Kaijuto just says, yeah, the DLC sounds lame. So maybe this begs the question, is this good
3077160	3085120	news or is this bad news? I think it's really all about in what is it that they're offering?
3085120	3089240	I mean, none of us here on the show, and I think in chat really appreciate that pay to
3089240	3093880	unlock content that feels like a slap in the face, you know, the, uh, content that's already
3093880	3098720	on the disc that you have to pay money to get like the, you know, the Katamari levels
3098720	3102080	were there. Some fighting games have characters that are already on the disc. You have to
3102080	3108160	pay to unlock and so on. But when you are truly downloading expansions that enhance
3108160	3114960	like, you know, what Dragon Age Awakenings in some ways. The Fable ones. Like extra quote.
3114960	3119400	Well, yes and no. Like some of the DLC I don't think is very good with Fable. But I'm saying
3119400	3127280	I'm using it as a type. Sure. Sure. Well, Awakenings is closer to the, to the model
3127280	3132120	that PC games used in the 80s and 90s and that it was a proper expansion that was a
3132120	3137680	good 20 or 30 hours of game, which is about how long I spent on it. With Dragon Age Origins
3137680	3143440	before I played Awakenings, I did go onto the BioWare store and buy some of their DLC.
3143440	3147120	And those were only like two or three hours long for five bucks, but I was still, it was
3147120	3152440	well done. So they're not all terrible. Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, my brother was commenting
3152440	3156000	to me about Nintendo not doing DLC. He said Nintendo should have made new tracks for Mario
3156000	3160280	Kart. And yeah, I'm kind of like, I would like to see Mario Kart seven, get more tracks,
3160280	3164360	download content, you know, as long as they don't go down that path that, you know, we
3164360	3167640	talked about Ridge Racer on the Vita a couple of weeks ago on the show, like it sounds like
3167640	3173760	they're doing a horrible thing, but like every Mario Kart game ever has had 32 tracks except
3173760	3179680	I think the Game Boy one, you could unlock all of the tracks in the original in, which
3179680	3182560	was a hell of a deal. You know what I mean? But most Mario, you know, you buy a Mario
3182560	3186720	Kart game, you know, you're going to get eight cups, four of them retro, four of them new
3186720	3190560	for, you know, it's, it's like the same formula every time, but I think it'd be pretty rad
3190560	3195080	if some more of the retro levels came back as DLC, you know, I would, I would support
3195080	3200160	that as long as it was reasonably priced, you know, there's gotta be a limit to it,
3200160	3204660	but it would be interesting. But I think there's a lot of ways that Nintendo could do this
3204660	3211160	very wrong too. And of course pay to unlock content is the wrong way to do it or stuff
3211160	3216560	that doesn't enhance stuff that's required for the core gaming experience would be bad.
3216560	3223000	Well, going down the same path, I got a story here about what's happening at the Wii U.
3223000	3228200	The Wii U obviously not going to be out for a while, but some rumors out there that Nintendo
3228200	3232960	is going to be doing a full blown app store for the system. So think like, you know, what
3232960	3237640	iTunes has going on. Right now, you know, they've got the eShop, they've got little
3237640	3242480	stores, but the Wii U supposedly is going to go one step further. There's going to be
3242480	3250200	a wide variety of apps. It will be stuff that will operate on the Wii U itself like TV things
3250200	3255080	like you see on Xbox 360, Major League Baseball, but some things that will run independently
3255080	3259560	on the controller because the tablet obviously is its own little screen or what have you.
3259560	3264000	Now the only thing that confuses me about that is I thought that controller doesn't
3264000	3268760	have its own processor in it. Like I thought all that did was stream video that's basically
3268760	3273280	being processed by your Wii U. It was just like a terminal, just like an output. Yeah,
3273280	3278400	it's like that on live in your own house. Best way to describe it, you know, that's
3278400	3283800	how it's working. So my thought is, well, are you really downloading apps to your controller
3283800	3287080	then or are you downloading apps that just play on your controller but you can't really
3287080	3291280	take them portable? Unless something drastic has changed with the specs of the system,
3291280	3295520	maybe they are giving that thing a little processor, I don't know. I would think they're
3295520	3301040	not because they want to keep the cost down, but it would be interesting if that's happening.
3301040	3305480	But they are talking about, you know, check your email, browse the web, do Facebook and
3305480	3309560	maybe some little games too on that little device. I could see where, you know, you have
3309560	3313480	the controller in your bedroom and it's streaming from the device in the living room and you
3313480	3317420	can kind of like surf the web from bed and all that, but I don't know, most people have
3317420	3323440	iPhones, iPads, Kindles, you know, other devices for that. Yeah. So I don't know if we use
3323440	3331640	necessary, but I don't know, what do you guys think? I can see the advantage, especially
3331640	3338200	if you just want one thing to give you all the convenience. So maybe that's a good thing.
3338200	3344800	And honestly, it makes me think of that, what's that laptop that my husband wants, the transformer
3344800	3350900	where you pull off the top and as a tablet, I think it might be something to that extent.
3350900	3357360	So like, say that you're, here's a, just a very domestic example, but you know, say that
3357360	3362940	your Wii is your way of surfing the web, you know, and you like are looking for a cake
3362940	3367440	recipe, put the cake recipe on your little tablet, take it to the kitchen and go make
3367440	3373540	your cake. I mean, I'm just using that as an example. That would work. I could see that
3373540	3378240	in a little Nintendo promo they do, you know, because there, there are marketing it to more
3378240	3385920	of a home family type of thing. So that way you've got more uses out of it. Something
3385920	3392560	that is on that family oriented domestic level. So I don't know why the chatters are doing
3392560	3396600	this, but they're putting app in the names of all these Nintendo franchises like app
3396600	3403760	zero, the app of Zelda app, Icarus excite app. But that, I mean, one of the ones that was suggested
3403760	3408240	by GOV day was app crossing. And that made me think, Oh God, there's where DLC could
3408240	3413520	go really wrong is animal crossing. Oh man. I mean, it could be really good, but I just
3413520	3417880	see, Oh, I could just see the easy cash in on animal crossing. You know what though for
3417880	3425040	Wii U imagine animal crossing with Wii U you can go to the island again. Maybe, who knows?
3425040	3428880	I just would like to see them do something really different with animal crossing. You
3428880	3433080	know, they've got the basics. We've seen the same game four times now. I'll be nice to
3433080	3440400	see something different. Tom Nook is a real estate agent. Great. Tom Nook can foreclose
3440400	3448600	on me. Can't wait. All right. Anyhow, he is the 1%. All right. Dark soccer. What do you
3448600	3454600	have for us news wise? I have a little something actually it's a cease and desist that my
3454600	3462040	apologies. It's that's later story. It's cease and desist that story right now. Yes, I will.
3462040	3468880	All right. It's the UK prices. Well, actually the European union prices for the Vita and
3468880	3475280	the memory cards and stuff. So, um, here's some of the game prices. Um, uncharted golden
3475280	3487320	abyss will be 49.99 euro or 44.99 pound. Bond nation racer will be 39.99 or 34.99 respectively.
3487320	3494240	Everybody's golf the same wipeout 2048 the same unit 13 also the same little deviance
3494240	3500440	will be 29.99 euro and 24.99 pound. And then, um, reality fighters is the same price as
3500440	3506240	well. So as far as the, um, different bits that go with it, the four gig memory card
3506240	3513680	will be 19.99, 17.99 pound. Um, eight gig will be 34.99 or 31.99 and the 16 gig will
3513680	3524560	be 49.99 and 44.99. Uh, lots of other stuff too. Like the chargers 49.99 slash 44.99.
3524560	3529320	All these different man, England. Why do you have to stick with the pounds? Why can't you
3529320	3533440	know? I should probably kind of a decent thing that they did given where the euro started
3533440	3540080	going. Anyway. Um, I'm actually trying to get the price of the system on here while
3540080	3543600	that's loading. Why don't I just jump in here real quick in case you are wondering, you
3543600	3547920	hadn't heard the, the u s American currencies. I did pull up Amazon real quick to just kind
3547920	3551880	of most of what dark soccer said. If you just replace euro with dollars, it's pretty much
3551880	3557080	the same thing. Uh, the wifi system itself, two 49 99 and dollars. The first edition bundles
3557080	3561000	is going to be three 49 99. The games right now are all over the map. It just really depends
3561000	3566840	on what the game is. Like uncharted 49 99 little big planet, 39 99. Uh, but like hot
3566840	3573440	shots, golf, golf, golf. What is golf? Hot shots, golf. It's a cool game. Gore physical
3573440	3579360	game. Hot shots, Gore. If I'd buy that hot shots golf though is 29 99 as is wipeout 2048.
3579360	3584200	So I'm assuming maybe those games are a little, I don't know. It's hard to tell. Like touch
3584200	3589160	my Katamari is also 29 99. Is that indicative of the quality? I don't know. I hope not.
3589160	3595040	Well, we do have the list of, um, the, the u s release titles too. Not a, it's actually
3595040	3601280	says the full list from the u s PlayStation blog. On launch day there will be escape plan.
3601280	3607440	Um, hot shots, a golf world, invitational hustle Kings, little deviants, my nation racers,
3607440	3614000	road trip, super star dust, Delta, uncharted golden abyss, a wipeout 2048 and as far as
3614000	3617920	third party stuff goes, just to look this over and point out the stuff that isn't absolute
3617920	3623560	crap as far as I know. Um, blaze blue continuum shift extend. This is just a great name. Army
3623560	3629880	core of hell, luminous electronic symphony. Is that launch day or launch window says launch
3629880	3641120	day. Nice. Um, what else is on here? Uh, plants versus zombies, Rayman origins. Um, touch
3641120	3646400	of space, mutant blobs, touch my Katamari, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom versus, uh,
3646400	3653120	ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three. And as far as launch windows, um, does Gaia three
3653120	3660060	Ridge racer, silent hell book of memories. So we're seeing some stuff. I think Ninja
3660060	3668320	guidance. Is that Sigma? Yeah, it's actually the Sigma symbol. I know my Greek. So yeah.
3668320	3673000	All right. So, um, yeah, Vita, I know I'm going to probably have to pick one up now,
3673000	3677720	especially that no luminous touch my Katamari. I will totally touch your Katamari. You want
3677720	3682920	to, I'll only touch yours if you touch mine. Okay. Uh, Alan, I know you're probably not
3682920	3686120	going to buy a Vita the day they come out cause you know, you'll play mine when I'm
3686120	3690480	at work, but what do you think? You're going to touch this Katamari when you touch my Katamari
3690480	3694400	while I'm at work. Yeah, probably. Are you excited about the release at all? Are you
3694400	3699360	just like, eh, whatever, another system, you know, I've heard Vita has had some mixed stuff
3699360	3703800	going on in Japan that there's been a lot of bumps in the road. I don't really have
3703800	3710440	the energy to like Stan or to be really fanatical about a system, but it took about a year.
3710440	3715800	It took about two or three years, but the PSP I thought was a really good system, a
3715800	3722280	really good handheld. And I really think that the PSP is underrated, dare I say it, because
3722280	3728880	the DS, which was phenomenal, sort of steamrolled it, which is a reality. But you know, I'm
3728880	3733040	looking forward to the PSP Vita because I thought the PSP itself was damn good, but
3733040	3738920	I just, you know, financially and with the time I have towards games, I can't really
3738920	3744620	get all that excited about a launch day purchase like I would have been 10 years ago. So maybe
3744620	3749360	for next Christmas though, once things get ironed out, the next Christmas, I'll want
3749360	3753920	a 3DS because if I'm doing things two years later, then I'll want, yeah.
3753920	3757880	Good to know. Good to know. I can start planning ahead. All right. Well, let's move on with
3757880	3759540	some more news, Alan.
3759540	3764000	There was a recent interview with Kojima of Konami, the mastermind who wrote the Metal
3764000	3771680	Gear series and reminiscing about Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation 1 and how amazing
3771680	3781120	it was. And just him looking back on the experience and he was basically answering speculation
3781120	3787920	about a possible Metal Gear Solid remake because they are doing the HD remake for the PS3 of
3787920	3794340	I believe it's Metal Gear Solid 2 and Snake Eater. But Metal Gear Solid, the original,
3794340	3798640	isn't a part of it. So people are like, well, obviously that was the most famous of the
3798640	3801920	3 because it was groundbreaking, you know, especially on the, it was probably one of
3801920	3808000	the best looking games during the entire PS1 life cycle. Does that mean that they're going
3808000	3814680	to be releasing one separately? And Kojima has just said, you know, that's ultimately
3814680	3821360	it's Konami's decision. If they want to do a remake of it, that's fine, but he won't
3821360	3826500	really like, he doesn't care enough. He thinks the game is perfect or is good at it as is.
3826500	3829960	He didn't think any corners were cut that he would want to go back and rewrite parts.
3829960	3834760	He thought that the story was complete the first time it was told. So they're welcome
3834760	3841400	to do it, but Kojima is not really saying that he's psyched up about wanting to remake
3841400	3842400	it.
3842400	3848640	Would you, do you think it's worth them or worth it for them to put the time and effort
3848640	3852560	into remaking the first game? I mean, I kind of get why they're doing that because I think
3852560	3856360	they're probably taking the easy way out with the 2 and 3 remakes, you know, just quickly
3856360	3857360	up-rezzing.
3857360	3860720	It's like what the God of War, which I know it was Sony and not Konami, but it's just,
3860720	3863400	they were already nice enough graphics that they could just upscale the textures.
3863400	3867580	Right, which is probably what's happening with Silent Hill too. But this, you know,
3867580	3870760	going back and doing the first one would be, you know, they're not going to be able to
3870760	3871760	do that as easy.
3871760	3875920	Didn't they kind of remake one already for the GameCube with Twin Snakes?
3875920	3876920	Yes.
3876920	3880600	That was, the script and the voice acting was changed a bit, but it was still ultimately
3880600	3884160	that game. The story was retold.
3884160	3888880	And it was really great. I mean, I thought it was probably, of course, we have just about
3888880	3892280	every Metal Gear thing that comes out, so it was really great.
3892280	3897460	Yeah, so with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes for the GameCube, that's kind of like if they
3897460	3903280	did an HD remake of Resident Evil when we have the Resident Evil remake on the GameCube.
3903280	3906800	Again, totally different franchise, but it's the same thing. Like, we've already kind of
3906800	3913640	had that. So, you know, if, I mean, let's be real. If they remade Metal Gear Solid HD
3913640	3917680	as a separate release, people would buy it. So if Kami wants money, they should do it.
3917680	3921520	But Kojima is just, you know, he's not.
3921520	3924520	But a lot of people would rather they just put that effort into making a Metal Gear Solid
3924520	3925520	5.
3925520	3926520	Yes.
3926520	3927520	Which, story-wise.
3927520	3928520	Which obviously you would want Kojima on board for that.
3928520	3929520	Right.
3929520	3930520	Because it'd be a new story.
3930520	3936520	Right. So, all right. Well, moving on. It was brought up earlier in the show that Steam
3936520	3941120	is having a crazy sale right now. I wanted to just take some time to kind of talk about
3941120	3942560	a lot of the crap that's on sale.
3942560	3943720	I did get Bastion.
3943720	3945520	Did you? Were you able to buy it through the website?
3945520	3946520	Yeah.
3946520	3952440	Nice. Well, Bastion is five bucks right now. Skyrim is 33% off. Batman Arkham City is 50%
3952440	3956500	off right now. That's crazy. There's lots of other games. And in fact, I even saw somebody
3956500	3960400	in chat earlier, I think it was Pod Culture said, damn it, I just spent 20 bucks on that
3960400	3965240	sale. Like, curse you, Evil Steam's Tales. Like today, or the first, is really kind of
3965240	3966880	the encore day.
3966880	3972680	Magica is a good pick. That's $2.50. LA Noire Complete Editions, $12.50. I mean, that game
3972680	3977880	was just six months old. So it's interesting. A lot of this stuff that's on sale. What's
3977880	3981600	also interesting is the competition that they're doing. Well, it's a competition. What's the
3981600	3985720	right thing to call it? The achievements for loot, basically.
3985720	3986720	Yeah.
3986720	3992680	They have these set achievements and with them, you can win little coupons for games.
3992680	3998360	Like I got a 75% off Left 4 Dead 2. Basically like, have the sale anytime you want type
3998360	4004720	of thing. Or you can get little pieces of coal. And the little pieces of coal can either
4004720	4010520	be contest entries into winning every game Steam has ever put out ever, is the grand
4010520	4014840	prize. Like you would never be able to play all that. Or I think you runner up prizes
4014840	4019320	are like all the games on your wish list and like every Valve game ever made and you know,
4019320	4023680	things like that. What's interesting, I was reading about this and something I want to
4023680	4030520	bring up. I just read about this today. I guess Steam ran out of the third party prizes.
4030520	4034020	Like if you get seven pieces of coal, you're only going to be able to get Valve stuff with
4034020	4037640	that now. There's nothing third party you can get with that now.
4037640	4041200	There was a game I'm blanking on what it was that was released on Steam. I think it happened
4041200	4047600	a year or two ago where they ran out of the license, like the codes, like the CD key code.
4047600	4052040	You get one of those digitally. They didn't have, like they ran out so they couldn't sell
4052040	4055920	the game anymore because they didn't have the manufacturers. So it's probably the same
4055920	4058320	thing here. They gave away the little free.
4058320	4064020	Or the agreement was they would take the loss up to X many copies. But a lot of people are
4064020	4069520	upset because there's been those accounts out there that have kind of been abusing this.
4069520	4074920	We had a story a couple weeks ago about people were creating accounts just to trade the games
4074920	4079020	and get the coupons and trade, you know, kind of setting up all these sock accounts and
4079020	4084920	Valve had to do this. So a lot of people are kind of upset with the way this played out.
4084920	4089520	And I'm kind of of two mindsets. I'm like, well, honestly, Valve does a lot more than
4089520	4094400	most people do when it comes to cheap games and that stuff. So I kind of like they don't
4094400	4097840	owe you anything. But at the same token, if I was really working towards something and
4097840	4102680	then found out, oh, they're out of it, like on the last day I got it, it would be frustrating.
4102680	4108800	Certainly. You've been trying to save up coal. Were you going to cash it in now? Maybe not.
4108800	4112880	I need two or three more and I have no idea what is even available. And now it sounds
4112880	4116440	like thanks to this story, there's even less available for me to look at. So I'm even less
4116440	4117440	motivated.
4117440	4120840	Is there anything Valve you don't own? Counter strike?
4120840	4128180	Counter strike and just stuff that I don't care about because it's multiplayer or whatever.
4128180	4132660	One thing, though, about this whole sale and these achievements is that it really shows
4132660	4138760	how Valve works with the developers of these indie games, because especially with like
4138760	4144700	Toki Tori, whenever Valve has one of these sales on Steam, there will be several games
4144700	4149260	that will get updates where the developers have designed Christmas content specifically
4149260	4156820	for Steam, which is unprecedented. And Toki Tori had, it was basically the first world,
4156820	4160340	but it was all reskinned with snow and Christmas trees. So the developers went in and added
4160340	4165760	that for the sale. And Super Meat Boy, same thing. There's now a Christmas world for this
4165760	4166760	sale that you can go in and play.
4166760	4172680	The one for Beat Hazard was mean. You have to play 10 minutes of Christmas music without
4172680	4177840	dying or without losing. And I did it twice and lost it nine minutes, 30 seconds. I was
4177840	4178840	so pissed.
4178840	4182560	So you and the developers of Beat Hazard were like, all right, there's a Christmas sale.
4182560	4187320	We're going to add Christmas music. Your Steam client will update the game automatically
4187320	4191660	for this sale. Like that's, I can't really think of any other example of when that's
4191660	4192660	happened.
4192660	4196420	Well, I love, well, the outside of Steam. Yeah. But I was going to say the Portal 2
4196420	4201620	release. Remember they had the whole unlock Portal 2 early thing on Steam and they had
4201620	4204920	special achievements and like audio surf. Like I remember one day I went to go play
4204920	4210220	audio surf and suddenly Portal 2 music just showed up like, and like I tried to play a
4210220	4214840	song and it was like, GLaDOS is taking over. And, and suddenly it was a Portal 2 song that
4214840	4220640	was really awesome. So I like when they kind of do stuff like that. So, yeah, you know,
4220640	4225180	but you know, I like this comment from Derek H in chat, especially if the thing they are
4225180	4228240	out of is digital and therefore not real.
4228240	4233920	That's frustrating knowing that, Oh, you just ran out of something that's on the internet.
4233920	4239420	Well, it needs a license, but yeah, no. So, um,
4239420	4243020	Advances themselves are more for inventory and marketing purposes.
4243020	4246180	Well, my thought was that they just have an agreement with the developers. Like, Hey,
4246180	4250140	we're not going to give away unlimited amounts of 75% off your game. It's going to be limited
4250140	4255120	to 100,000 or something like that. You know? And I think for the sake of those third party
4255120	4258860	developers, many of them indie, I get it. And I cut them some slack.
4258860	4263620	Whatever they sell, they have to report back to the manufacturer because they have those
4263620	4264620	agreements.
4264620	4269120	Sorry. I love Derek H's follow up comment. It's like running out of birthday wishes.
4269120	4276960	I was going to wish you a happy birthday, but I used up my last one three days ago.
4276960	4281020	When I woke up this morning, I had like five or six fucks to give, but now it's three o'clock
4281020	4286080	and I don't have a fuck anymore. You missed. I'm you're too late. If you caught me a noon,
4286080	4291860	I would have gave a fuck. But now I don't act deaf in chat says, uh, clarifies the abusing
4291860	4293280	of this, uh, sky.
4293280	4298480	Many people cheated and had multiple accounts on steam to trade coals and stuff with themselves.
4298480	4304040	So why do you need all these fake accounts? Get a significant other Alan and I traded
4304040	4307220	stuff.
4307220	4311520	If I have any coal, you guys can have it. There's nothing left to get with it. Like
4311520	4315900	the only, this is why I don't even do this shit. No, seriously. I didn't sign up for
4315900	4321320	any of it. I'd do it. Cause you know what? I have other stuff to do. Well, when I'm the
4321320	4324800	winner of every steam game ever, you can't play it.
4324800	4330560	Well some of the achievements are have, have a wishlist or make, make sure that your wishlist
4330560	4334420	has at least 10 things in it. That was worth a lump of coal. So if you created 20 accounts
4334420	4338800	and you added 10 games to your wishlist, you could then pipe all of those other 19 other
4338800	4346180	coals to your, so some of them weren't necessarily game achievements. It was just steam interaction.
4346180	4352160	Then I'm sure I have a coal. So I'm too good for coal. What are you talking about? We want
4352160	4357520	diamonds. I guess what sky is trying to say is that if you're forever alone dot JPG, the
4357520	4360540	sales isn't for you then apparently cause you need a, you need a, you need a partner
4360540	4367960	to help you do this. No forever alone on steam. Um, some folks are talking about Skyrim and
4367960	4371200	I just wanted to say, cause this made me think about, you've been playing challenge accepted
4371200	4376160	cause you don't chat says I want Skyrim on PC for the mods. The mods are going to be
4376160	4379920	sick. I've been playing on PlayStation three and I've been watching Alan play it on PC
4379920	4384680	and I'm like, no, I kind of want it on PC cause like you had a inventory mod or something
4384680	4391040	that yeah, I downloaded a mod from Skyrim nexus that basically makes managing your bag.
4391040	4394600	Like I can sort by weight so I can see what all the heavy shit is that's weighing me down
4394600	4400120	so I can get rid of it. I can sort by weight. I can sort by, yeah, so it's an awesome add
4400120	4406200	on to make bag management and Skyrim awesome and you can do that on PS three. So act Defton
4406200	4410800	chat says, guy, you really have no idea. There are people with over a hundred multiple accounts.
4410800	4414680	Good thing they got banned. Well yeah, good thing they got at least valve band them. Some
4414680	4418920	companies may not have even caught it. So you know, at least they got banned. But yeah,
4418920	4423080	I agree that, you know, I don't think valve is this type of company though. Again, I just
4423080	4426680	kind of look at their track record. Steam overall has been a great thing for the community.
4426680	4431720	It really has. Yeah. Um, and I think in the long run they'll kind of look back at this
4431720	4436360	and go, okay, next time we need to, if we're going to give somebody coal for getting their
4436360	4439880	wishlist done, we need to make it so that they can't trade that to somebody else who's
4439880	4442720	already unlocked it for the same reason. Like they'll go back to the drawing board and I
4442720	4446440	think they'll fix it for next time or they'll do something different. You know, they'll,
4446440	4450840	they'll learn from it. I think they will, but it does. It does suck that it had its
4450840	4458080	issues this time. Um, all right, let's move on with more news. Gosh, we're having a long
4458080	4459080	show.
4459080	4463040	Let me show the story that I was going to read. How about it? I guess I can lift that
4463040	4468320	cease and desist order. Well, actually it was a Activision that put out the cease and
4468320	4476880	desist on a dude who hacked Skylanders Spyro adventures. Anyway, um, this guy named Brandon
4476880	4483760	Wilson had a hacked the game to where basically figured out the conversation between the piece
4483760	4490240	and the game so that he could basically mount any piece he wanted to in the game. And so,
4490240	4496880	uh, so, so he figured out how that little, little, uh, um, toy and portal magic portal
4496880	4499680	were talking to each other and he got, he put it up on the internet, which of course
4499680	4507440	that's what they send out the cease and desist. Right. And, um, he wrote out, um, a note that
4507440	4512900	said, you know, what, uh, that the accusations were inaccurate, you know, that he wasn't
4512900	4517360	really sharing them with other people. He had them on a zip file for his own use and
4517360	4524200	he wasn't circumventing the game. He was basically just using stuff that was available and not
4524200	4532360	using, um, uh, the hardware on a iOS device. And he didn't really trick anything. So he
4532360	4537440	just, he just figured it out. He just found it out. He didn't actually use it. Well, are
4537440	4542440	you able to rip off Activision by doing this? Like you can't just suddenly magically buy
4542440	4548320	the figure. You can just make the, if you use another system to make it think you have
4548320	4552360	the figure, but doesn't, isn't there still like a code for the DLC? Like you can't just
4552360	4555780	magically download something that isn't there. Right. Like would you be able to exploit and
4555780	4560480	steal money from Activision by doing this? Or is it just, you figured out how magnets
4560480	4567340	work? Yeah. You figure out how magnets. Well, I mean, but I mean, there are inevitably going
4567340	4571420	to be, would it be somebody that wants to know how the magician does the trick? Well,
4571420	4576880	I'm double checking something on here. He basically just found out how they connect.
4576880	4583100	So I'm trying to find where exactly he listed that. I'm pulling up. I'm asking chatter says
4583100	4588640	I have not played Skylanders yet. So chatters, how do you, do you have to have a code to
4588640	4596640	get the DLC? Um, RFID and uh, as soon as just playing the seat to figure out how to work,
4596640	4601800	how it worked and he put up the way it worked. And so I guess maybe it's Activision is afraid
4601800	4606480	that someone's going to use that to seal. Oh, no. You mean if the game is successful,
4606480	4610760	people are going to try to rip it off? If it's successful. Yeah. I understand it's been
4610760	4618160	doing all right. So anyway. Yeah, I think that's pretty much it. I think he just got
4618160	4622840	bored, figured it out and save the information for himself and then people, and then activings
4622840	4626920	like, Oh my God, people are going to use it and steal from us. All these five year olds
4626920	4632960	with their toys. And so, uh, dark to see in chat says this talk of Skylanders makes me
4632960	4639400	want a new version of barcode battler. I wish you could see how I would just rolled my eyes.
4639400	4643920	I remember those things are awesome subbing for Loki tonight. Should I be throwing shit
4643920	4647200	and screaming about Skylanders? Cause we're talking, we're talking about it. Go ahead.
4647200	4649960	But don't throw anything cause all the stuff near you is heavy. No, I was going to say,
4649960	4654120	this is, I wouldn't throw stuff in dark Sakura's house either, but like everything that I would
4654120	4660960	hit with stuff that we own. So Skylanders makes me very angry there. It's my Loki rant.
4660960	4668440	That was a pretty crappy impression. All right. Uh, folks in, in chat aren't really, um, uh,
4668440	4671880	able to answer the question about Skylanders, but I do see Derek H says, Oh, well of course
4671880	4675560	there's a delay. There's like a minute delay. Derek H in chat says, so corporations are
4675560	4682760	now trying to make it illegal to learn. I think it's the specifics they don't want getting
4682760	4688340	out there. You know, again, I, I don't think it's a big deal. I mean, if this, cause they're,
4688340	4693000	if this guy can reverse engineer the thing and figure out how it works, don't you think
4693000	4696680	EA's already got somebody on it? They're just not going to post to the internet that they
4696680	4701080	figured out how it worked. You know, they, they probably emulated it already or either
4701080	4704680	they have their competing version for their own franchise franchise is going to come out
4704680	4709920	at the end of next year. You know, I think the thing is though, if that, if this somehow
4709920	4715480	allows people to download free DLC, then that's going to be an issue. But at the same time,
4715480	4720700	if they didn't think that far ahead, then I don't want to say they deserve it, but they
4720700	4728560	were asking for it. Hackers going to go cry, cry me a river, build a bridge and get over
4728560	4732240	it. Well, I'm pretty sure those figures have to come with a code that you have to input
4732240	4736120	to actually get the DLC. Otherwise the figure just, you know, tells the portal, this is
4736120	4741060	the one I want to use or, you know, maybe we take it to friends houses, whatever. Well,
4741060	4746860	if it works, if it works on just, you know, talking to, because I think that that would
4746860	4751080	make sense to not exactly have a code for it, but to have it just, you put the figure
4751080	4755960	down and it connects. I think that they might've been confident that no one would be able to
4755960	4759760	figure it out. But then again, that was, that was, that was a dumb assumption. That was
4759760	4764480	a stupid, stupid assumption. How many other video game companies have done the same thing
4764480	4768600	is what I'm saying. Again, I don't want to say they deserve it. Our security is foolproof
4768600	4774120	too. If that's, I don't want to say they deserved it in that case, but derpy do. That wasn't
4774120	4779960	a smart decision. No, but, but it's been going around. It's a common thing amongst, you know,
4779960	4784200	developers. No one's going to figure this out. Let's just, you know, be all confident
4784200	4791840	and kiss our own asses. No. So. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out
4791840	4795760	some release dates, some games that are coming to a store near you. I kind of don't think
4795760	4799000	there's a lot this week. Wonder what that could be. Could it be that the holiday period
4799000	4804440	is now over? So, uh, but we'll see if there's anything after all. Um, Alan, you're filling
4804440	4810840	in for Loki tonight. What about the US releases? Well, according to, um, the source that we
4810840	4818840	use, it looks like there's one solitary, sad little game coming out this week. Um, it's
4818840	4825000	going to pick up next week. I believe on the 10th is a, is some of the 2012 for Q1 releases.
4825000	4828840	I think you start, especially towards the 31st. I think you have a couple of big ones
4828840	4834040	on the 31st. But between now and the next episode of OLR, we have Anarchy Reigns for
4834040	4840760	the 360 and that is it. And I couldn't tell you the thing about it. So there you go.
4840760	4844960	Um, I'm going to Japan to look at, well, I'm not going there physically, but I'm going
4844960	4848160	to look at their releases of things that are coming out and I got to tell you, I don't
4848160	4852840	see a damn thing coming out in Japan. I'm looking quickly to see if even the 3DS. Well,
4852840	4857400	don't they have any week two VITA stuff or did it just have it launch? Nope, it just
4857400	4861880	had this big launch. The next big game coming out is Wipeout 2048 on January 19th and Tales
4861880	4867320	of Innocence. It comes out on the 26th. Otherwise, you know, they already, you had a huge launch
4867320	4871760	and you're not going to wait one week to put out your game. So did you hear those stories
4871760	4876720	though about that? Apparently the 3DS is outselling it already in week two. Someone in chat was
4876720	4884640	saying that I think it was Ranma. It was like LOL at VITA. So, Hmm. Maybe this was the 3DS
4884640	4890600	strategy the whole time. Sure. Right. Yeah. But you know, whatever it is, it'll be interesting
4890600	4894280	to see if, if the numbers are the same here. You know, I don't want to be all like fan
4894280	4899560	boy and root for one or the other. I'm interested in both, but it's certainly not a good sign.
4899560	4903820	If you look at the technology of what the VITA has feature wise and what it's trying
4903820	4908440	to do versus the 3DS, which is just, Hey, it's a polarized 3D screen that you don't
4908440	4913560	need glasses for. I think the VITA is trying to accomplish more with the technology that's
4913560	4920220	in it. But Hey, sometimes that just goes to show bleeding edge technology and you know,
4920220	4925440	the perks aren't necessarily what move the system. All right. Well, um, no releases in
4925440	4930120	Japan this week. So how about Europe? Well, to quote a line from one of my favorite movies,
4930120	4937760	space balls, we ain't found shit. That's it. A very slow release. One game coming out in
4937760	4941040	the entire world. I personally don't give a crap about us coming out on the 10th. What's
4941040	4945680	that? That Gotham city imposters. What is your hatred for Gotham city imposters? It
4945680	4951360	looked, it looked silly, silly, cute. That's kind of part of my problem. It's like, it's
4951360	4955320	a bunch of wannabes and you know what? If I'm going to play a wannabe, I'll just play
4955320	4964260	DC universe online, which I can't follow that. I can't follow that. And it was shit. Wait
4964260	4971680	a minute. I, it was shit. I wouldn't say it was shit. Okay. It was, um, here a fart. Here's
4971680	4977840	it. Look, DC universe was definitely not. Wow. DC universe felt more like teenage mutant
4977840	4981280	Ninja turtles, the arcade game than it did. Wow. I hate the control. And if you're not
4981280	4984840	into that, then you're, of course you're not going to be into DC universe and I hate the
4984840	4989800	camera, but I thought PVP was a lot of fun in DC universe. I gotta say I, but you're
4989800	4993520	not a player versus player kind of person. No, I'm not. And I will dabble in it. I'll
4993520	4998560	experiment with my previous statement. And if I want to play a superhero game, I'll go
4998560	5005440	back and play city of heroes. That's fair. And if I want to play, um, a game by that
5005440	5010820	company, I'll just play Star Trek online, which I'm going to once it's free. Isn't that
5010820	5017960	later this month? Yes, it is. I've been reading on the road to a F2P blog that is every time
5017960	5023120	that they do an expansion or something, it's road to whatever. So now they've got, um,
5023120	5031580	number 25 of the road to F2P, uh, blog going on. So I'm pretty excited. Well, of course
5031580	5036400	you've ruffled the feathers of our chat room, dark Sakura. I don't give a shit. Brad from
5036400	5043360	pod culture says, Oh no, she didn't. Oh yes I did. Tiger cloth says Gotham city imposters
5043360	5049440	looks amusing. It looks like a bunch of people in bad cosplay costumes shooting. Yes. Yes,
5049440	5056640	yes, yes. And if I want bad cosplay, I'll go to Fana Mae where there's occasionally
5056640	5065560	some good cosplay. Derek, Derek H has drawn a line in the sand and says city of heroes
5065560	5070200	is a lot crappier than DC universe online, but it has better control and better camera.
5070200	5073920	Alan, you, you were a DC universe or excuse me, you were a city hero stand for quite some
5073920	5079880	time. I just played it for like 20 minutes just yesterday. It's free to play now. Um,
5079880	5084400	city of heroes has a very strong RP community and it's still kicking. So yeah, that's say
5084400	5088280	sea of heroes is, but if you're not into RP, like I don't know when I, when I listened
5088280	5091960	to dead pixel live and what I know of Derek H, he doesn't strike me as somebody that's
5091960	5097140	really into RP. I mean, it might, it might be like a, you know, the secret lives of,
5097140	5101560	you know, that, that, that, but I just don't get that. That's why he plays games. My favorite
5101560	5105800	thing to do though was in city of heroes make costumes, which is actually the same thing
5105800	5111680	that the only thing I like doing in DC universe. Why are you playing Barbie the game? You should
5111680	5118720	see how I play Sims. I spent all my Sim game building the damn house and deciding what
5118720	5122320	they're going to look like. That's what you fucking do in the Sims is you build a house.
5122320	5128300	But I don't do any of the get married and have babies shit. If I do anything, it's go
5128300	5133320	sit in the park and play guitar and get a lot of money and then go home. Hack computer,
5133320	5137280	go home. You are living out your fantasies of being a bum. That's what you're doing in
5137280	5143200	the Sims. You are living out your fantasies of being a bum. No, I can do that in real
5143200	5151920	life. I'm unemployed. No. All right. Fun, employed, fun, employed. Let's move on a couple
5151920	5155400	more news stories for you guys. Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
5155400	5163640	But first, Alan. Well, we have another classic game story before Dark Sakura gets into hers.
5163640	5169120	For those who remember the Sierra Online text adventure games, the big three franchises,
5169120	5175840	King's Quest, Space Quest, and Police Quest. Well, the fandom community for those games
5175840	5179200	is still going strong and a group called... You forgot Quest for Glory. Yeah, Quest for
5179200	5184160	Glory came later. Oh, judging you so hard right now. I love that series too. Infamous
5184160	5191760	dash adventures dot com just released their HD fan community remake of Space Quest II,
5191760	5198440	Vohaul's Revenge. The original came out in 1987. Space Quest only had two games that
5198440	5203880	were the really blocky 16 color EGA graphics. Why are you smirking? What do you want to
5203880	5209600	say? No, I'm looking at chat. I'm not smirking at you. I'm just looking at chat. I promise.
5209600	5217880	And then Space Quest III, The Pirates of Pestilon had a graphical update, even though it was
5217880	5223880	still text-based. But yeah, Space Quest II is probably the best one of the whole franchise
5223880	5229040	to be honest, or at least before they went to point and click. It took them five years
5229040	5234360	to get this out there. But yeah, it looks like on the 30th of December, just two days
5234360	5240360	ago, it's final. You can play Space Quest II with updated graphics due to the things
5240360	5245160	to the fans that go through and revamp this stuff. I would really suggest if you are interested
5245160	5248960	in this at all, you grab it now. It's free, right? Yeah. So you should probably grab it
5248960	5253740	now because as soon as everybody gets back to work on Monday and the lawyers are back
5253740	5258700	at work, there'll be a cease and desist letter. Any predictions tomorrow? Tuesday? This gets
5258700	5265560	cease and desisted? What do you think? I think by Monday, five o'clock. See, there's a different
5265560	5271040	community that remade King's Quest III, and I think four, Perils of Rosella, which I think
5271040	5276120	when I sat in for Dark Sakura was my pick for classic game. Those are still up there.
5276120	5280080	Those didn't get C&D'd. Really? Well, what about the whole silver lining thing? That
5280080	5284380	was a new property, I think is why. And then the fact that King's Quest... Telltale Games
5284380	5288440	is getting a new property. Right. And at the time we didn't know that King's Quest had
5288440	5293480	been handed off and there's gonna be a new one coming out from Telltale. And that silver
5293480	5297200	lining went through this whole ugly thing where it was like, yes, you can do the game
5297200	5300880	as a fan game. No, you can't do it at all. Okay, yes, you can do it, but it can't say
5300880	5308120	King's Quest on it. I mean, finally it fucking came out. But if that's what... I kind of
5308120	5312160	look at what happened to the silver lining and I'm like, this is not gonna last. Yeah.
5312160	5316320	There are fan remakes of some of the original King's Quest games that I know are still out
5316320	5320800	there that have been out for a year more. Also, King's Quest is Roberta and Ken Williams
5320800	5326040	and Space Quest is the two guys from Andromeda, Mark and Scott. And Roberta don't give a fuck
5326040	5330080	anymore. Yeah, she's... She has said fuck off to the game industry. She lives in a cabin
5330080	5334780	in the Yosemite. She has accomplished the American dream of living in a fort and get
5334780	5341680	off her property. Yeah. You know, bless her heart. But the fact that she did King's Quest,
5341680	5346360	somebody else owns it now. That's a pro. It's probably why she bought a fort. Yeah. You
5346360	5353880	know, and I'm not lying. I believe that she does live like in a outwards, you know, type
5353880	5358360	of thing. Yeah, but Space Quest 2 definitely improved on the first one. It's hard as hell.
5358360	5363320	It's text-based. Save often because you will die and it's possible, like with some of the
5363320	5368480	other Sierra games, to save your game past a point where you didn't pick up the item
5368480	5373880	that you need to beat the puzzle and you literally have to start over. And I just want to be
5373880	5378040	clear when I joke about the whole cease and desist thing. I don't want to see this thing
5378040	5381880	get cease and desisted. I think this is a great, you know, imitation is the finest form
5381880	5386560	of flattery. Yeah. And obviously people have very big spaces in their hearts for these
5386560	5390160	types of games of yesteryear. I will probably if I can download this and play it because
5390160	5394440	I used to love these games. You know, I was more of a King's Quest person than a Space
5394440	5400400	Quest, but nonetheless I'll still play and check it out. But I just, you know, I also
5400400	5403520	unfortunately am all too familiar with the business side of things and how these things
5403520	5407760	tend to get shut down. So we'll see. Well, just this last year, Streets of Rage got the
5407760	5413120	super hella fan remake and that was one, two and three plus a bunch of extra fan added
5413120	5419360	crap. That was up for a week before Sega was like, nah, nope. Take the hint game companies.
5419360	5422840	I mean, I realized Telltale's like kind of trying to crank those out and that's kind
5422840	5430960	of their niche now, but you know, they can't do everything. So maybe people want to see
5430960	5435920	it. They can try. It's Vivendi Activision that I think has the Sierra properties. I
5435920	5439800	will say I am stupid excited for a new King's Quest game from Telltale. I think it's going
5439800	5445120	to rock. Yeah. So I just, you know, please don't let me down with this Telltale. Please,
5445120	5449600	please don't let me down with it. But I, I'm, I have high hopes for that. That's, that's
5449600	5454200	a series that has been gone from the gaming community far too long as King's Quest. These
5454200	5458520	other games and King's Quest eight mask of eternity was a horrible nightmare. It never
5458520	5462480	really happened. So just, you know, I would have moved into a fort too if I pushed, put
5462480	5466920	that game out. Yeah. Yeah. Well no, that wasn't her, but I thought it was no mask of attorney
5466920	5471440	was developed by nothing to do with Kings. I thought she still kind of oversaw it or
5471440	5475320	her name was just on it because she ended grant. The plot of it was about some night
5475320	5482400	goat arriving in Daventry and becoming King after King Graham. But that the whole style
5482400	5487360	of it, cause it was like I so view three D where you like, it was like an action game.
5487360	5491600	It was, it was, it was awful is what it was. Yeah. So yeah, no, that wasn't Roberta Williams.
5491600	5495440	Huh? All right. I thought for some reason she had something to do with it, but maybe
5495440	5501440	it's just because she invented King's Quest and all. Anyhow, moving on. Uh, some stuff
5501440	5506000	that is coming to Xbox live arcade, thanks to all these different ratings boards around
5506000	5510720	the world, we know some of the games that are becoming to Xbox live arcade within the
5510720	5515220	next year. And there's some interesting things that are on here. Uh, AMY, but the battle
5515220	5520180	rising bang bang racing, deep black episode one and two defenders of our Dania dungeon
5520180	5527520	fighter live happy action theater haunt. I am alive. Uh, next week's coral Rayman three
5527520	5533760	hood, limb havoc, retro city rampage. That's that grand theft auto. We type game, uh, saints
5533760	5538840	row money shot, a spinoff game that apparently from what I was reading about this game, it's
5538840	5543920	some type of little mini game where you play the bullet and you try to go through as many
5543920	5549080	things as possible as the bullet. It sounds very over the top and very saints row, a scary
5549080	5555000	girl shank to the Simpsons arcade game that had been leaked earlier. Uh, sign Mora, Sonic
5555000	5561960	the hedgehog for episode two, uh, spelunky Tetris party challenge, warp world gone sour
5561960	5566040	and racketeer. That is like a compilation of everything over the past few months that
5566040	5571120	has been leaked from ratings boards and other websites. Uh, that's what the roster will
5571120	5577160	look like for 2012. That's a good six months or releases right there. I'm sure. So there
5577160	5583120	you go. All right, well, we've been talking a lot about classic games and indie games
5583120	5590760	and so forth. We need to take a step back in time to a simpler time when there was no
5590760	5597960	DLC or patches for games. If the game was broke, it was just broke. It's dark soccer
5597960	5602360	has picked a broken game. Just kidding. It is a little broken. Sometimes dark soccer
5602360	5606080	has picked a mighty fine game as a classic game of the week. And as I understand tonight,
5606080	5611200	kind of a, a nod to, you know, I don't usually pick these kinds of games, but that, that
5611200	5615680	dot, right? Well, actually it was one that I found myself enjoying quite a bit when it
5615680	5619520	came out. So this is going to be surprising to a lot of people, even though I've brought
5619520	5629680	it up before and the game is WWF WrestleMania 2000 for Nintendo 64. Yeah, I, I, I said it,
5629680	5637920	I picked it with its bad guitar synthesizer sound. Um, basically it, um, it came out in
5637920	5644720	1999 or it actually came out in 2000 in Japan for Nintendo 64. It was, um, based off of
5644720	5653320	their annual pay-per-view event. And honestly, this was when I was watching WWF regularly,
5653320	5663560	you know, during their whole attitude thing. It was the NWO and, uh, China, China. Yeah.
5663560	5672720	Oh man, that one was a mess. I was a big China fan at the time. You know, back when, uh,
5672720	5678840	everyone was laughing because, um, Stephanie McMahon got boob implants, like, and you can
5678840	5684240	totally tell the difference between one episode and the next. And you know, all the best divas
5684240	5694080	coming out at the time, you still had, um, uh, fabulous moolah and, uh, what was her
5694080	5702020	name? May, May, what's her name? Her buddy. They were, you know, we were both fantastic
5702020	5707640	wrestlers in their day. You're asking the wrong people wrestling trivia. May young,
5707640	5713800	May young, who would threaten to show her puppies. That was, that was like the best
5713800	5719500	era of wrestling ever. You know, you had Test back in the day and you had, uh, the Hardy
5719500	5729480	Boys and, uh, Kidman. Um, I remember his last name, but that was like the time that I would
5729480	5734120	totally be into wrestling. And Dan and I were both watching it and we loved it. So when
5734120	5738400	this game came out and everyone's like, this is the best wrestling game ever. You gotta
5738400	5748200	get it. Guess who got it? That was us. So, um, when it came out, it actually had like
5748200	5754280	this amazing story mode. You had Royal Rumble, you had King of the Ring, you had, uh, the
5754280	5760480	pay-per-views. Yeah. And the, the story modes were like watching the TV episodes, all the,
5760480	5766280	the, you know, steroidal man drama you can handle. Cause honestly I think that wrestling
5766280	5777880	is, uh, um, soap operas for straight dudes. No, some of the chatters are chiming in. Um,
5777880	5784020	you know, we're a little bit delayed here. May young, uh, ivory Tory Wilson, Lita, Billy
5784020	5792360	Kidman, attitude era, reality era. Yeah. And you know, you also had a lot of stuff going
5792360	5797400	on with, uh, Steve Austin. So there was that going on too. Yeah. I have never played this
5797400	5800800	game, but I'm loving in the background. I see some of the signs. One of the signs says
5800800	5809960	China suck it. That's awesome. I was hugely into WWF at the time. Um, like all babies
5809960	5814920	kids were, but there was a part where I think half of it was that I kind of grew out of
5814920	5819920	it and then half because I remember it was Roddy Piper versus Hulk Hogan. That was the
5819920	5824920	big, that was the, that was the big war of good and evil was Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan.
5824920	5831320	And then a lot of the major characters left and it was stone cold. It was stone cold Steve
5831320	5837540	Austin that brought it back from the doldrums because they had an icon again that they could,
5837540	5841460	you know, he was, he was awesome. But by then I think I had outgrown it. Um, I remember
5841460	5846240	playing some of the, the PS one wrestling games that were good though. Yeah. Well I
5846240	5850800	have to tell you about, okay, the create a wrestler mode in this was actually super good
5850800	5856560	and they had a lot of the moves of some of the famous Japanese wrestlers who, because
5856560	5861480	what happens I think is that they saved the same engine and use it for like, um, whatever
5861480	5869940	the fire pro wrestling and the various ones over there. Um, but it had all the signature
5869940	5875660	moves and you could do custom, uh, a stage entrance when you did the create a character
5875660	5880320	so you could actually design everything that happened when they come out on the end of
5880320	5884200	the ring. You could choose their starting music and it would actually have loops of
5884200	5890040	some of the original music, but you know, it's an incentive 64 cartridge. It was really
5890040	5896400	limited on the samples that it can handle. Um, but it was just super fun. I mean, we,
5896400	5905720	Dan and I made this guy who is in degeneration X. Yeah, yeah. NWO was a WCW. Degeneration
5905720	5914640	X was the big one for, um, for WWF and we made this guy and he won every match and we
5914640	5919440	would just put him in autoplay mode so you could just watch him play. And, um, he went
5919440	5924580	every match in every title, including the women's belt. He beat China for the women's
5924580	5930920	title and it was just so super fun. It was a really fun game, but like some of the characters
5930920	5938480	that you had, the road warriors and Hulk Hogan and Taka Michinoku, who was a legend in Japan.
5938480	5946960	He did not get enough nods over here. You had, uh, um, you could actually create some
5946960	5953800	of the WCW characters because, um, I believe it was THQ, but they had the same, um, they
5953800	5958640	had done the other games too. So you could actually recreate Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Scott
5958640	5967680	Hall, you know, you can even make Macho Man. Uh, there were, um, if you had two, if you
5967680	5971840	were doing a tag team match and you actually picked people who were on the same team, it
5971840	5976120	would, you know, have them be introduced under their team name instead of just their individual
5976120	5984120	names. Um, you had, uh, all kinds of stuff. I think you could also do Hell in a Cell and
5984120	5988340	you could do, uh, I don't think you could do, I don't remember if the ladders, tables
5988340	5994760	and chairs matches were in it at the time, but those were pretty fun too. Um, you actually,
5994760	5999400	the commercials, I remember they were funny too because you had the Rock, um, doing Christmas
5999400	6006840	themed ads. Yeah, Kane was in it and the under faker, I mean the under biker, I mean the
6006840	6011080	undertaker. He's still around, right? Yeah, he's still doing it. I don't know why because
6011080	6015280	that man's had knee surgery and back surgery and everything else, surgery. You know, what
6015280	6021760	was the best about this? It had mankind in it. Oh wow. I remember him. Uh, Mick Foley.
6021760	6028780	Yes. And Mr. Sacco. He would put a dirty sock on his hand with a mouth drawn on it and shove
6028780	6035680	it in people's mouths. Oh, even I remember that. That was awesome. I remember insane.
6035680	6042520	I had to learn wrestling because one night and this, you can, I know this was the doing
6042520	6046880	of Travis and Jessica over at under station live because we used to all do Rocky horror
6046880	6050600	in Sacramento together. We did a wrestling night one night. I don't know who's suggesting
6050600	6053880	that was, but I somehow think Jessica was a part of it. I don't know why she has the
6053880	6058200	metal blade. I remember she was heavily involved in that, but I had to learn wrestling because
6058200	6063960	I had to play one of the characters because we did, we did, we played wrestling people
6063960	6070220	in Rocky horror. That was the invention of the metal bull bra. Yes, it was. I was supposed
6070220	6077680	to be Steve McMahon, the owner guy as Vince McMahon. I was Vince McMahon. Yeah. At least
6077680	6083960	I didn't say Ed McMahon. I was Vince McMahon as riffraff was fun. Cause like I had, I had
6083960	6089240	the sister or daughter or something. It was magenta and we were like boobs and we were,
6089240	6093040	you know, like riffraff and magenta in the movie. That's pretty funny. If you're into
6093040	6098220	Rocky horror, it was really funny. Like it's like, seriously, one of the most, um, fun
6098220	6102020	fucking shows we ever did because we actually had our own TLC match. It was tables, ladders
6102020	6111800	and cookie sheets. I'm sitting in front of the bar and we had a fucking table and a ladder
6111800	6118160	and a cookie sheet. That's great. And you know, I miss, I miss, um, the deadly boys
6118160	6123080	because they would actually set the, they used to be in ECW, which was like the really
6123080	6127600	hardcore wrestling association and they would just set tables on fire and throw each other
6127600	6131720	through it. Anyway, anyway, sorry, back to games. Anything else you want to say about
6131720	6136560	the game? Um, you could get special copies that had a special hologram card with it that
6136560	6143760	had, um, different pictures of in game action, like an entrance or a finish. So, but I mean,
6143760	6148720	it was just an awesome game and it had everything at the time that you would expect to see on
6148720	6155000	TV. And yeah, the music was kind of crap, but who cares? It was fun. And I mean, and
6155000	6161280	like I said, Dan and I would just, I would spend hours making a character and then let
6161280	6165640	them watch him play. Just watch him play it. Like we had that one dude who was in purple
6165640	6173960	and lime green who beat everybody. And I think he had like Sean Michael's hair. So, so he
6173960	6180440	had a bullet. All right. Anything else to say about wrestling? I miss when wrestling
6180440	6186640	was good. Some of the chatters would say it's still good. All right. There it is. Your classic
6186640	6191680	game of the week. Alan was going to say, you don't like John Cena, the John Cena era. I
6191680	6197560	like John Cena. I do like John Cena. I have to say, I like him because he doesn't look
6197560	6205440	over-weighted and he's actually good. I liked the rock because he wasn't acting then name
6205440	6213080	a good movie with the rock in it. Can't do it. I was actually going to say, um, the mummy
6213080	6218760	too, cause he was in it for five seconds and he was, whatever. All right. I did like scorpion
6218760	6225280	King. We're done. That's classic game of the week. That man looks good in tight pants.
6225280	6234320	WWF. Yes, because it was the WWF back then. WrestleMania 2000 on the Nintendo. All right.
6234320	6237920	We're going to take a break. When we come back, we have plenty more horizontal to come,
6237920	6242680	including the all important, the moment you've been waiting for all night. I'm sure game
6242680	6245760	of the year, 2011 discussion. I don't know what dark soccer is going to pick. I don't
6245760	6248840	know what Alan's going to pick. They may not. They, they don't know what I'm going to pick.
6248840	6252360	Alan thinks he knows, but maybe I changed my mind. So I'm worried at least one or two
6252360	6255900	of ours will be the same. So, well, we'll see. It's okay. Because you know, there is
6255900	6259240	no right or wrong answer. Also your picks for game of the week. We're going to come
6259240	6265640	up with the OLR game of the year for 2011. All when we come back, um, you might be surprised.
6265640	6269800	We'll see, or you might not be. We'll see. So we'll be back with plenty more of orange
6269800	6280740	launch radio right after this. Stay tuned. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.
6280740	6287760	We are live on this first of January, happy new year, 2012 with the 440th episode of our
6287760	6292320	show from the new studio set up. Although if everything's been done, right, you shouldn't
6292320	6296320	really be able to tell at all that it's a new setup. Uh, Rob Roberts, of course here
6296320	6301280	with you with dark Sakura and Alan tonight filling in for Loki. It occurred to me, I
6301280	6307480	realize why we have less background noise and extra reverberation. What's that carpet.
6307480	6311240	That's yeah, that's a big part of it is that you don't have the sound bouncing everywhere.
6311240	6315180	Yeah. It's kind of the way it's partitioned is differently too. It's just, you know, setups
6315180	6319640	are going to be weird. So, uh, anyhow, Loki of course, we'll be back next week. I don't
6319640	6323360	want anyone thinking funny business is going on, but it is technically a holiday and, and
6323360	6326400	uh, he, like many other people has to go back to work tomorrow. So I think there's a dinner
6326400	6330120	thingy going on tonight that he's at. So, uh, he'll be back next week to talk game of
6330120	6333880	the year with us. Uh, but the three of us that are here tonight, we'll get into our
6333880	6339280	game of the year picks here shortly, but first we've got to talk about some rapid fire news.
6339280	6345120	So Alan, since you're filling in for Loki tonight, why don't you start us off by the
6345120	6350640	way, it was a slow news week. So, uh, there's kind of some less stories and we usually have
6350640	6358880	just, you know, yeah, there is a MMO coming out in China, I believe called the age of
6358880	6365100	Wulin and a certain gentleman, uh, who wants to play this game very much went to an auction
6365100	6371520	being held by the developers, snail games. And, uh, basically he bought an online item
6371520	6375540	for his character. Once this game comes out, he's going to have, I guess some Epic God
6375540	6385840	tier sword for his character that he spent, um, us dollar equivalent $16,000 for, for
6385840	6393140	a weapon for his tune in a game that no one knows sort of gigantic E penis if it's even
6393140	6398400	a good game or not. Now looking at the screenshot and I think this is a, um, yeah, the, the
6398400	6403800	official age of Wulin trailer it's on YouTube. It looks pretty. So vision, I mean, obviously
6403800	6409120	it's not some back alley studio that is making an ugly game. It looks pretty, but yeah, 16
6409120	6417940	grand for an Epic item. Also at this auction, they sold a, a sheath, meaning not a weapon.
6417940	6421840	It's the thing that you put your weapon in for your character for the hook of departure
6421840	6431480	for $1,600 and another sheath for the Lordly spear. I'm not, yeah, uh, for 2,500 just does
6431480	6436680	he get his name in the game or any special thing for spending this much money? I mean,
6436680	6440380	I don't know. Like I've heard of people like spending a lot of money on an eBay auction
6440380	6446120	because they can win a role in the game or the money goes to charity or you know, something.
6446120	6450280	But this doesn't appear to be the case. It sounds like, um, I would hope that this item
6450280	6454200	would be bound to his account. So whatever character he rolls can use it. Maybe he'll
6454200	6459200	be able to kick everyone's ass in PVP. I don't really know enough about the game to know
6459200	6465160	what this is going to do for him, but it looks like he received a commemorative plaque that
6465160	6470560	with his name engraved on it by a snail games saying the, you know, thou, Oh, this you now
6470560	6474680	own this sword and you're awesome cause you gave a 16 grand for it. Um, and it's a one
6474680	6479460	of a kind items. So the graphic, I guess of visually the texture of how the sword looks
6479460	6483560	in its name and its stats, he's the only one in the whole system that's going to have it.
6483560	6488720	So his EP will be even bigger. Yes. You know what? When I would do stuff like that for
6488720	6496900	my private servers on Ragnarok online, I would pay $5. Yeah. And I, when I was in the city
6496900	6502440	of heroes, I would buy their costume packs, which was about three to six bucks for like
6502440	6505880	mutant. Cause you know, when city of heroes like dark Sakura was saying there are millions
6505880	6511400	of combinations of costumes for your character, some of them were DLC. So I've spent money.
6511400	6518720	Um, I've raised change points. I've raised changed a, my main and wow. Um, I'm just not
6518720	6527680	spend what you could buy a automobile, uh, for a perk. I have the most I've given blizzard
6527680	6531860	is that I moved my character twice on wow. And that was, you know, that's 50 bucks that
6531860	6537380	adds up. And the more I think about it, the more it kind of irritates me because blizzard
6537380	6540880	kind of double dips in that way that you pay a monthly fee and you have all these micro
6540880	6546000	transactions, but you know, they, they have a quality fucking game. They can get away
6546000	6550880	with it for now. Yeah. That's why, that's why the star Wars thing actually excites me.
6550880	6554220	I think competition is healthy. I think competition is going to be very healthy thing. I hope
6554220	6559100	star Wars does legitimately, you know, even though I say two games can coexist, I do hope
6559100	6563560	the two games can kind of tug and pull from each other a little bit. It'll be, it'll help
6563560	6567640	us all in the long run. And for the record, all the cryptic points, I did a lot of that
6567640	6573560	in star Trek online. So that's why I have a defiant retrofit. And yeah, it looks like
6573560	6579960	this game in China is entering open beta this spring. So it's, I should sign up for it and
6579960	6583820	it looks like we are getting it here in the U S but it still needs to be put through open
6583820	6587840	beta in China. So I don't think there's really a due date on when we're going to get it here
6587840	6593640	soon. I played Ragnarok online in Korean. Yeah. So did I, I remember that, but for the
6593640	6597720	I was like, Jamie, what do I do here? Jamie, what do I do here? You played with me on the
6597720	6602760	American one on the American beta. I thought there was, I remember a translation patch
6602760	6607640	for the career. There was a translation patch because some of the NPCs were still in Korean.
6607640	6614440	Oh, okay. Then. All right. I played that one, but I played the Korean one before that. Whatever
6614440	6619760	one that great. All right. It was fun. And this article does make a brief mention of
6619760	6624520	the wank over elder scrolls for oblivion, which of course it was the game that came
6624520	6628520	out before Skyrim, which is a lot of making a lot of game of the year lists right now,
6628520	6633760	because oblivion had DLC where you could make pretty armor for your horse that literally
6633760	6638320	did nothing. It was just, you know, metal for your horse. I kind of think the gaming
6638320	6643400	community just needs to let that go. Like I understand that that is the quintessential
6643400	6647200	like thing that people will point out for DLC, but also at the same time, Bethesda has
6647200	6651800	come out and the industry has learned from that mistake that we will not do that again.
6651800	6655960	That was, you know, you know what, nobody was fucking doing it then and we did it and
6655960	6664440	we learned, you know? So, okay. Kind of a break. Anyhow, what else do you have for us?
6664440	6673880	What do I have for you? Hold on. Pirated games via torrents or use net or whatever a list
6673880	6680000	is. The Torrent Freak, which is a big sort of underground torrent news site, if a torrent
6680000	6683960	site gets, like the Pirate Bay, if they ever get raided, Torrent Freak is usually the site
6683960	6692160	that reports on it, you know, like, journalistically. They have compiled lists of the top pirated
6692160	6702880	games via piracy or by digital torrent download. For PC, we've got Crysis 2, Call of Duty Modern
6702880	6706360	Warfare 3, no surprise there, would have been probably number one if it came out earlier
6706360	6714160	in the year. Top Wii game downloads, Galaxy 2, Mario Sports Mix, surprisingly, and Xenoblade
6714160	6717760	Chronicles, which is... What the hell is Gal... Oh, Super Mario Galaxy 2. Yeah, sorry. Super
6717760	6723280	Mario Galaxy 2. Perfect. Okay. Mario Sports Mix and number three is interesting, Xenoblade
6723280	6727320	Chronicles, which you would think would be a no one cur game, but it's an issue of...
6727320	6736080	It was translated in English for the Europe market and according to this, the tally, 950,000
6736080	6741680	confirmed downloads via the various torrents that you could get this game on. And that's
6741680	6747480	a thing where if Nintendo didn't have their head up their ass and put that out here, then
6747480	6752360	maybe that number... But they are gonna put it out here, Alan. Yeah, too little, too late.
6752360	6757600	Anyone here who wanted it either bought it and paid the 90 bucks to import it for their
6757600	6766280	modded Wii from London or wherever their UK retailer is, or they pirated it. And of course,
6766280	6773480	Modern Warfare 3 access isn't a problem there because America is the biggest market for
6773480	6778080	that game and it's just people don't wanna pay 60 bucks for it. So sometimes it's just
6778080	6784520	an issue of people being cheap. All right. But yeah, and then a top 360 pirated downloads
6784520	6790120	via BitTorrent. Gears of War 3, no surprise there. And then of course, number two, Call
6790120	6797520	of Duty Modern Warfare 3. So all the... Mostly the big multiplayer games. All right. Moving
6797520	6805800	on to a couple... Speaking of piracy and torrents and all that, SOPA exists to try and shut
6805800	6810520	some of that down, but unfortunately, the way it's written, it leaves room for a lot
6810520	6814520	of other stuff to go wrong. And so obviously, a lot of internet savvy people are very much
6814520	6818920	against SOPA. We've talked about it here on this show before. Obviously, we don't support
6818920	6822960	it either here at Orange Lounge Radio. And it seems like the number of people that are
6822960	6826400	supporting it are dropping. Obviously, I don't think I need to touch on it here. It doesn't
6826400	6829840	really directly relate to video games, but I'm sure you've all heard about what GoDaddy's
6829840	6834380	been going through with this whole thing. And obviously, they had quite a number of
6834380	6837900	embarrassing PR stumbles, where I think you were hearing the Benny Hill theme playing
6837900	6843060	in the background with every press release. Well, the good news is that Nintendo, Sony,
6843060	6850000	and EA have all as well dropped SOPA support. An update to the government's list of SOPA
6850000	6855380	supporters show that the names are now no longer on there. Of course, there is no word
6855380	6861620	as to why. Is it because they saw the tech community backlash to what happened to GoDaddy,
6861620	6866800	or maybe that whole debacle made them rethink the position, or maybe they just, you know,
6866800	6873060	realized finally it was not a good idea? Whatever the reason, it's a relief to see these gaming
6873060	6879620	companies are finally dropping out and taking their names off the list. Hooray.
6879620	6883280	Some more rumors are floating around about Epic Mickey 2. Now, you might remember there
6883280	6887660	was an earlier rumor based on a survey that had been out there, some type of like focus
6887660	6892140	group thing that had people choosing the box art. Well, the rumors are circulating again
6892140	6895940	this week because I guess there was an online newsletter that Disney put out that just flat
6895940	6903500	out said Epic Mickey 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii in fall of 2012. You
6903500	6909780	might remember the original Epic Mickey game was a Wii exclusive, but maybe because of
6909780	6915160	that or what, it didn't sell maybe as much as it could have. And so it's kind of interesting
6915160	6919780	in a way that it is getting a sequel after all. Supposedly the sequel, Epic Mickey 2,
6919780	6923620	will also have co-op play, including two player split screen, which is something we don't
6923620	6928580	see in games all the time anymore. One person will be Mickey, the other will be Oswald the
6928580	6933980	Lucky Rabbit. I love Oswald. So that's kind of cool. I like it because Epic Mickey kind
6933980	6938660	of brings the classic Disney stuff. I wonder if the bad guy now will be Mortimer. Don't
6938660	6945380	know. No word yet if Epic Mickey 2 may actually come out for Wii U instead of Wii. Right now
6945380	6950340	they're saying Wii and that the Wii U ought to be backwards compatible. So there you go,
6950340	6954780	Dark Sakura. Well, in other news, there's a fun little game that I just purchased today
6954780	6959820	called Bastion. And apparently other people have decided to buy it as well because it
6959820	6967980	exceeded $500,000. And that's an indie game. So I mean, it's really catching on, don't
6967980	6974860	you think? At any rate, that's with Steam and Xbox Live arcade sales. So, and my apologies,
6974860	6983460	I didn't mean dollars. That's 500,000 copies sold. My apologies. So yeah, good game. And
6983460	6986740	a lot of people think so. To be honest with some of the deals on Steam and so forth, I'm
6986740	6991140	surprised it's not higher. It's a quality game. Well, it's, you know, the story is also
6991140	6996740	like from what, a couple days ago? So maybe. Who knows? Who knows? And it just said exceeded
6996740	7003540	that. So. And also a really, really hard NES game has been translated into English. It's
7003540	7011980	called Takeshi's Challenge. And to quote the article here, the game was made by the devil.
7011980	7021180	One of the ROM modders, King Mike, has translated it into English so you can play it. Is it
7021180	7027180	like Beat Takeshi, the guy that was in Battle Royale? I want to think so. Actually, I'm
7027180	7033980	pretty sure that it is, but I can find out. I am the very sure that it is from Beat Takeshi.
7033980	7038060	Very cool. Yeah. And he had that, he sees, has the show that's been ripped off here as
7038060	7042820	Wipeout, right? And that they didn't, they didn't take Takeshi's castle and they had
7042820	7046820	the dubs that were on here in the States. Didn't they, wasn't that a thing? And that's
7046820	7054660	still on? Yeah, it was Takeshi's castle and it was what the ultimate challenge. Yes. Yes.
7054660	7064020	Exactly. So, all right. Hold on. What? Um, yeah, Takeshi no cho senjou and it is Beat
7064020	7071700	Takeshi, Takeshi Kitano. Nice. All right. Well, before we get into some more news, the time
7071700	7077140	has come for you to lip sync, wait, no, just kidding. For us to talk about the game of
7077140	7082700	the year of 2011. And we're going to go around the table and see what we here at OLR thought
7082700	7085580	was the game of the year. We're going to start with a community. Obviously it's the show
7085580	7090260	where every gamer has a voice and earlier this week on Facebook and Google plus in our
7090260	7094880	communities there, we asked you guys, what do you think is the game of the year? And
7094880	7098700	I wanted to make sure this is important. You guys understand there's no right or wrong
7098700	7103060	answer. The whole point of the show here is that it's where every gamer has a voice and
7103060	7107600	everybody's into something different. People can only afford sometimes to buy the games
7107600	7113380	that were from last year or, you know, not everybody is necessarily into RPGs or shooters
7113380	7118060	or racers. So I think this is important to really just kind of open it up to like, you
7118060	7122300	know, actual gamers that are enthusiastic enough to be listening to a podcast and fan
7122300	7128840	their page yet may not necessarily find the same critical darlings to be as successful.
7128840	7134020	Or maybe they did. I mean sometimes, you know, what the critics pick really is the cream
7134020	7137180	of the crop. So let's see. Let's start with the community first and see what some of you
7137180	7143520	guys out there said was the absolute bestest game to come out in 2011. Or I'm sorry that
7143520	7147540	you played in 2011. It may have been a game that actually came out previously. Because,
7147540	7152940	you know, God there'll probably be some games I don't get to play until 2012. Because 2011
7152940	7158620	was so crowded with so many good releases. Can I also start off by saying, it was a great
7158620	7162820	year for games. It really was. I know we come in here like every year and say that, but
7162820	7166760	well I don't, I actually don't think, I think some people have said, it seems like every
7166760	7172140	year we keep saying, how are we going to top last year? But I really feel like some years
7172140	7178140	weren't as good with games. Like I don't remember looking back at last year going this was the
7178140	7183500	best year ever for games. But this year was really, really, really good. Alright here's
7183500	7189860	some of what you guys picked. Over on Facebook, Zether said number 3 Mario Kart 7, the best
7189860	7195300	one. Number 2 Saints Row the 3rd, wacky insane, better than Grand Theft Auto 4 in every way.
7195300	7198380	And his number 1 game of the year is Portal 2, an excellent follow up with a very good
7198380	7204300	single player campaign and solid co-op. John Keegan said, I shouldn't say the full last
7204300	7210540	name, sorry, John K said over on Facebook, best 2011 game, Arkham City, based on the
7210540	7215720	variety of missions and improvement on an already awesome original. Otherwise I played
7215720	7221980	older games in 2011 of which Assassin's Creed 2 and Uncharted 2 topped the charts based
7221980	7231820	on an awesome story and solid gameplay. Derek W said, Resident Evil 4 HD, kind of a remake
7231820	7238300	of an older game. Great injection to a boring year of military shooters, looks beautiful.
7238300	7243860	Fallout New Vegas download content, the most rewarding and content heavy DLC seen yet.
7243860	7252660	And number 1, Skyrim, Fus Ro Dah. Tom S said Skyrim, Skyward Sword and Saints Row 3, didn't
7252660	7257180	really give reasons but those are the top 3. Mike B said, Gears of War 3, very well
7257180	7262580	done, kind of like a masterpiece of sci-fi shooters. Let me think about the other two.
7262580	7269380	Times up! Johnny R says, number 3, Alice Madness Returns, beautifully haunting sequel to one
7269380	7274060	of my most beloved games as a child. Number 2, Catherine, excellent puzzle game with a
7274060	7278500	rad story to go with it. Number 1, Mortal Kombat, great fighting game that stepped it
7278500	7284900	up with an amazing story mode. Oh, Mike B did come up and say, Saints Row 2, yes 2,
7284900	7296700	not 3, I just discovered it in 2011. Kashiiko Janai, I think it's DJ Janai, says, number
7296700	7302340	3, Super Mario Land 3D. I didn't watch a lot of El Hazzard, did I? A great blend of
7302340	7308260	traditional Mario and new Mario styles. If only Sonic could achieve this feat, oh snap.
7308260	7313900	Number 2, Portal 2, funny story, great puzzles, awesome acting. Number 1, Minecraft, the ultimate
7313900	7323940	never-ending sandbox of building ADD insanity. OMG! Joe R said, number 3, DDRX3 vs DDR Second
7323940	7328660	Mix, still some love for the Bomani games. Well, it was either this or DDR2 and I noticed
7328660	7333780	they still couldn't get the interface quite right. Number 2, La Mulana on the Wii, no
7333780	7338580	surprise there. I think I'm more surprised that it's not number 1. He says, take what
7338580	7342700	made Kade's story so great but throw in some extra block and switch puzzles. Also recently
7342700	7348340	announced that a PC port will come to Steam. Number 1, The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.
7348340	7353420	I'm digging up this one a lot more than Twilight Princess, great game expecting to sink at
7353420	7359340	least 30 hours in before I'm done. Bradley B said, number 3, Chime Super Deluxe, adds
7359340	7364340	4 good to great songs to the roster and adds perfect quads and changing layouts to further
7364340	7369740	add to the gameplay. Number 2, Portal 1, or excuse me, Portal 2, oops, number 2 is Portal
7369740	7375260	2, all around fun and adds so many more hilarious quotable quotes to the Portal universe. Number
7375260	7379900	1, Bastion, the narration makes what would be a pretty good action game a great one.
7379900	7387340	The narration adds a story that is full and vibrant and memorable. Miguel I says, Portal
7387340	7393580	2, best sequel ever. Forza 4, best driving game to date, a great combination of arcade
7393580	7398340	and simulation type racing. And Sequence, DDR and RPG combined into a really fun and
7398340	7403420	addicting game. Jim H says, Infamous 2 improves on everything from the first game and the
7403420	7408580	user generated content was a great addition. Number 2, LittleBigPlanet 2, any other year
7408580	7411700	the sequel to one of my all time favorite games that improves on the original would
7411700	7418980	be my number 1. And number 1 was Portal 2. He picked all 2's for his top list. Sticking
7418980	7422140	with the theme, it's an improvement on the original, has some of the best storytelling
7422140	7425820	and voice acting in gaming history. Add in the great gameplay and that makes it the game
7425820	7430420	of the year. Let me quickly run over to Google Plus because we had a few responses over there
7430420	7439820	as well. I wanted to read for you guys. And we had from DeadPixelLive commented, F1 2011,
7439820	7445300	Forza 4 and Pinball FX2. F1 2011 because it did what a sport sequel is supposed to do,
7445300	7449380	leave the good stuff in and add more good stuff. Forza 4 because the rival mode made
7449380	7454220	driving and competing fun. And Pinball FX2 because at the end of the year I realized
7454220	7459980	I had played it more than all my other games. Good reason. We have another response here,
7459980	7464220	it's written in Russian so I'm not sure how to say this so I apologize. Dark Soccer, do
7464220	7471140	you read Russian? No. Ok, so. Just pipe it through Google Translate. So unfortunately
7471140	7477940	name I can't read, sorry ignorant American. Says number 1, Deus Ex Human Revolution for
7477940	7482300	a great cyberpunk story and enjoyable gameplay. Too bad Exfer is not here. Exfer can read
7482300	7487420	Russian. Little known fact about Exfer. I remember when he was learning. Thanks to Nelly.
7487420	7492020	Number 2, Bastion, yeah cuz Loki's wife is Russian. And I remember all of the cards all
7492020	7496600	over your apartment and I almost learned to read Russian too. You'd think I'd know more
7496600	7501620	after living there but. Anyhow, number 2, Bastion for very polished representation,
7501620	7505780	great music and awesome narration. And number 3, The Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings for old
7505780	7511460	school hardcore RPG brought up to the next level on every aspect. Lastly, Wendy S says
7511460	7515880	number 3, Battlefield 3, favorite shooter, loved the way they did multiplayer player.
7515880	7521060	Number 2, NHL 12, favorite sports game, realistic simulation of hockey but not inaccessible.
7521060	7527180	And number 1, Portal 2 drew me in like nothing else could. So those are some of the responses
7527180	7534500	from Facebook and Google Plus. Very diverse. Did you guys catch that? Yes, but I put a
7534500	7540040	game on my list that they didn't. Interesting. So we're about to get to that here in a minute.
7540040	7547060	I wanted to quickly see if I could bring this up. I forgot to put it in the link or in the
7547060	7553020	show role because over on NeoGaf there's a thread where they're actually tracking what
7553020	7557900	the media, you know, all the different gaming outlets are naming as the game of the year.
7557900	7563100	So I kind of wanted to give you an idea what they were saying, kind of what the rest of
7563100	7570300	the internet is saying or what the critics are saying and so forth. Let's see. I'll have
7570300	7575460	to try and dig for this a little bit here. Any games that the chatters mentioned that
7575460	7583260	you were like, oh, I forgot about that game. No. Because they all like Angry Birds apparently.
7583260	7587080	I don't think anybody said Angry Birds actually. All right, here we go. I found it. So this
7587080	7590940	is from NeoGaf. Thank you to the folks over there that tallied this all together. Poster
7590940	7598200	was Cheesemeister. Has tallied up what the media. 72 different outlets has picked Skyrim,
7598200	7603420	and that's the number one. 22 outlets have picked Portal 2. 17 have picked Batman Arkham
7603420	7609280	City. Seven for Zelda Skyward Sword. Seven for Uncharted 3, Drake's Deception. No listener
7609280	7614260	put Uncharted 3. Very interesting. Four said Gears of War 3. Two said Bastion. Two said
7614260	7621260	Catherine. Two said Dark Souls. Two said Deus Ex Human Resolution. Two said L.A. Noire.
7621260	7624440	Again, surprised I didn't hear that from any of the chatters either. Two said Star Wars
7624440	7629320	The Old Republic. Two said Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP. And a handful of other
7629320	7637260	games got a mention as well. So, who cares about what the media thinks? Let's talk about
7637260	7641220	what we think. You know, I found our certificate where we were listed as the podcast of the
7641220	7647180	galaxy. Good. We have a little space on the new studio wall. I'll have to remember where
7647180	7652100	I put it. Go to Hobby Lobby and get a frame. Alright, let's go around top three picks.
7652100	7654860	Hobby Lobby my ass. I'm going to the dollar store. We're going to do this kind of like
7654860	7660540	we do Listless but without the elimination and not the voting so much. Let's go around.
7660540	7664520	And of course, justify your pick. Alan, we'll start with you. What is your number three
7664520	7673500	pick for best game of 2011? Skyrim. Skyrim. And 72 media outlets agree. I can see that.
7673500	7681480	Why did you pick Skyrim? It tries to do something that a lot of game developers are afraid to
7681480	7687180	do. Bethesda, rather, the makers of Skyrim. Ever since the original two Elder Scrolls
7687180	7694500	games which most people haven't played, Arena and I'm blanking on what the second one was,
7694500	7701060	there were sandbox games before Grand Theft Auto which is where that genre and that term
7701060	7708340	sandbox game came from. So you can literally do anything if you want to make a plate-wearing
7708340	7715700	warrior who casts spells. You can go exploring for hours, ignore the main plot completely
7715700	7722660	and still have stuff to do. Bethesda with Morrowind and Oblivion and now Skyrim, that's
7722660	7728460	always been their thing to make this really immersive, almost impossible to complete game
7728460	7734940	and Skyrim is the best attempt at it yet where even I know people in real life that have
7734940	7741060	played Morrowind Oblivion and it was such a burden, all this openness. They hated it
7741060	7745740	and Skyrim, there's something about it where they get better each time in streamlining
7745740	7752980	that combination of keeping your attention plus, holy shit, this is a whole huge world
7752980	7756660	to dink around in. Visually, it is gorgeous. It's one of the most beautiful games I've
7756660	7765660	ever played, especially on my PC which is now four years old. And yeah, it's for kind
7765660	7774160	of a... I get really into exploration and min-maxing stats and doing crafting and Skyrim
7774160	7780420	has all of that. It's a great game. Now is it just me or for a game as vast as Skyrim,
7780420	7785700	we really need a new fucking meme besides this arrow to the knee shit? I didn't get
7785700	7791340	that until I finally was in a town and I heard some dude, I used to be an adventurer like
7791340	7794780	you but then I took an arrow to the knee and I was like, oh thank you, it's something that
7794780	7799700	some dude says to you. Now I finally get that meme. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was from the
7799700	7805620	game but with a game so fucking huge, seriously there has to be something else. The 50,000
7805620	7809140	cheese wheels off the mountain was funnier than an arrow to the knee, I'm sorry. There's
7809140	7815740	a great picture of the Arl of Whiterun, the first king that you meet, where someone had
7815740	7821600	stacked hundreds of carrots, apples, cabbages all over him and they took a picture and he's
7821600	7826060	got his chin on his fist like a thinking man on his throne being all kingly and he's just
7826060	7832780	surrounded by like cabbages. It's awesome. Alright, DarkSakura, what is your number three
7832780	7837940	pick for game of the year? Batman Arkham City. Batman Arkham City, why'd you pick back Arkham
7837940	7843900	City? Because, and I honestly didn't play it but I watched Dan play it most of the time
7843900	7847820	and I just sit back and it's like watching a movie. It's what happens when you're married
7847820	7851180	or in a committed relationship, sometimes you let the other person do the driving, I
7851180	7856660	get it. Yeah, well, we've done that for tons of games between the two of us so, you know,
7856660	7863020	I just sit back and I totally dig the character designs. I love that they got Penguin right,
7863020	7870860	that he's this British gangster kind of guy, you know, and Catwoman was absolute hotness
7870860	7876580	except it is physically impossible to leap around like you do in four inch heels, just
7876580	7881740	like that. But it was, it was gorgeous a lot and had, Dan said that it took a little, you
7881740	7886580	know, time to get used to the control but the fact that it also brings over your information
7886580	7893580	from the last game is a big bonus. And, oh my god, Joker. Mark Hamill's last performance
7893580	7899600	as Joker. Maybe. No, officially. Yeah, but then they went and teased Arkham World and
7899600	7906060	you're like. He said on Twitter that he would come back specifically for a killing joke,
7906060	7911620	animated special. But yeah, it's interesting. Yeah. But throw enough money at him, he'll
7911620	7915820	do it. No, I don't think so. Get him better seats at the VGA's next year. But that was
7915820	7922060	just like a fantastic performance. And I really liked their Harley too, especially you find
7922060	7926460	the little Easter egg and, oops, spoilers, oops, you find a positive pregnancy test in
7926460	7932220	their little love nest. And then in one of the endings, she's singing to her baby. So
7932220	7938300	it's just lots of neat little things thrown about in there. And the whole business with
7938300	7941820	Hush, that was pretty cool because that was actually the last Batman thing I ever read
7941820	7948540	was Heart of Hush. I never, I was not a big DC person, but that was a really good storyline.
7948540	7953300	So yeah, it was really cool. It had lots of nods to just all kinds of different characters
7953300	7961060	and it was really neat. So that's, and also as a designer, love the design in the game.
7961060	7966580	It's beautiful for me. I just have to start off by saying this has been extraordinarily
7966580	7971420	hard this year. There have been so many, not just good, but phenomenal games this year
7971420	7976700	that I have, like, I, I told Alan like three days ago, what my list was going to be and
7976700	7980040	I've changed it since then. I've changed it several times since then. And even now in
7980040	7984460	my head, I'm like, do I really want to say this as number three or do I want to put this
7984460	7989100	game in there because this game was so fucking good. Um, but I'm, I'm going to just commit
7989100	7992880	to what, what I'm going to say here. And I really think, you know, I kind of look back
7992880	7999380	at fun and what game did I really enjoy? Um, I think my, my number three game of the year
7999380	8005780	is, um, Super Mario 3D Land on the 3DS because it, you know, and I said this on the show
8005780	8010060	when I first reviewed it, I really think it is the greatest Mario game they have done
8010060	8016420	since, uh, the Super Nintendo one. I think it's just the 3D works. It makes you understand
8016420	8021700	why a 3DS, you know, can, can work. Um, it's one of those games where you keep peeling
8021700	8026260	back the layers and even though it seems like, God, this game is easy as cake in the beginning,
8026260	8031340	it just gets crazier and crazier as you move on. Uh, it has a lot of the retro stuff that,
8031340	8035600	you know, you know, we love retro games here at OLR that we love. I just, I, it's such
8035600	8040300	a worthy reason to own a 3DS. And I think that Mario 3D Land is my number three pick
8040300	8046240	for game of the year. I think it might very well be the only 3DS game right now where
8046240	8053720	the 3D is more than just, oh, that looks neat. Cool. Absolutely. It's in 3D. When you play
8053720	8060020	Super Mario 3D Land, the 3D is an integral, integral part of the gameplay and the experience
8060020	8066740	and turning it down, turning that little notch down on the side, like, it damages the game.
8066740	8071800	And I love that you can have the, uh, you can invert the 3D too. Like, it's, it's hard
8071800	8074940	to explain unless you do it, but it's very easy. You have it pop out or be recessed inwards.
8074940	8081660	But it's still 3D. It's great. Uh, and I gotta remind you guys, I think still to this day
8081660	8087620	that Mario 64 was quite a bit overrated because of a lot of its move to 3D. Yet I love what
8087620	8095800	3D has done to Mario here. I look at myself and I can't justify it. Like, it just works.
8095800	8100460	And that's why I think it's, it's one of the greatest games to come out this year. Absolutely.
8100460	8110540	Um, Salacious Pop or Alan, your number two pick. Probably gonna say Dragon Age Origins,
8110540	8115560	since you said this could be games that we played, um, in this year rather than came
8115560	8119620	out. Uh, one of the reasons why I'm going back to a game from 2009 is that a lot of
8119620	8123860	the big, the big A-list games that came out, like Deus Ex, I haven't played them, so I
8123860	8130780	don't wanna talk out of my ass and hype up a game I've never played. Um, BioWare, ever
8130780	8136060	since, you know, the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG has shown that they are one
8136060	8143020	of the best narrative and character writers in the industry. Um, I would say even better
8143020	8149780	than Blizzard and Valve. And the twists and the, like, Alistair in Morrigan, who's, he's
8149780	8153900	the, um, other Grey Warden in Morrigan is the Witch of the Wild, they're the first two
8153900	8160460	NPCs you pick up. They're so engaging and I was fascinated with each of them for completely
8160460	8166180	different reasons and they were acted and written so well. And I was very invested in
8166180	8170980	how I manipulated the game to make sure that I got endings that were right for them. And,
8170980	8176620	uh, it's, Origins is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and a lot of the, um, D&D
8176620	8182420	game-based games that BioWare wrote in the 90s. And Dragon Age 2, if you play it, which
8182420	8187060	I believe that came out earlier this year, um, the menu and the UI, it's all very new
8187060	8191140	school. I'm not saying Dragon Age 2 is a bad game, but you can tell right away, even just
8191140	8198500	by the menus, that it's a different, Origins really harkens back to the 90s experience
8198500	8201100	for me, but with a present-day game or story.
8201100	8204300	Alright, so even though you went with a game that's a couple years old, you can do that
8204300	8207740	because this is your picks for best game of 2011 and sometimes you don't discover the
8207740	8208740	games till later.
8208740	8214340	Yeah, so for anyone who overlooked Origins, um, yeah, it's still relevant. Play it.
8214340	8218620	Alright, fair enough. Dark Sakura, your number two pick.
8218620	8227940	Ultimate Marvel vs. Ca- Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Galactus Flick. Bing! Making my hand hurt.
8227940	8235220	Awesome cast. Firebrand. Um, but I still go back and play Phoenix more than anything.
8235220	8242420	It's just fun. And She-Hulk, of course, because She-Hulk is hardcore. But yeah, it's just
8242420	8247860	a fun fighting game. It brought out all the DLC characters plus more characters that people
8247860	8255820	wanted to see except for no freaking Mega Man. But other than that, perfect. Fighting
8255820	8256820	game perfection.
8256820	8261860	Didn't bother you that it was only six months after the other Marvel vs. Capcom that also
8261860	8262860	came out this year?
8262860	8269500	No. Not really. I didn't buy any of the DLC.
8269500	8270500	There you go.
8270500	8274620	And you know, the tweaks and the gameplay actually made it worth it. It felt different
8274620	8275620	enough.
8275620	8280480	Alright. Um, my number two game of the year. It's one that's already been named, but I
8280480	8287300	think it's a game absolutely worthy of the list. I never expected to enjoy Batman Arkham
8287300	8292900	City as much as I did. And I, you know, I like Batman all the way back to like the Adam
8292900	8298860	West Batman. I admit I'm not as into reading the comics. I'm not as into the animated series.
8298860	8304140	I mean, I watched it a little bit when I was a kid. So I don't know the Mark Hamill Joker.
8304140	8307860	I don't know the characterizations of these characters as much as some of y'all do. But
8307860	8312720	I, I'll be damned if I didn't just love this game. I mean, it's just the story in it is
8312720	8317020	outstanding. The way they juggle all of the villains without making it seem like cheesy
8317020	8323740	or over the top is great. I love the exploration. Love, love, love the grand theft Batman style
8323740	8329520	thing that they have going on. Um, I think the DLC has done rather tastefully the way
8329520	8333180	you can have, I mean, the whole Catwoman debacle outside where some people didn't have their
8333180	8336360	codes, the stuff they kind of been doing beyond that, like the Nightwing and everything I
8336360	8341920	think is neat expansions to the game. I love the side missions. It's, it's a rewarding
8341920	8347160	experience and it's, it's, it's the total package when it comes to a video game. Absolutely
8347160	8355080	is. I have to ask you, did you do the, um, the, that were Catwoman abandons Batman? Yes.
8355080	8362280	Isn't it great? Yes. Screw him. She's such a bitch. Yeah, no, the way that, I mean, just
8362280	8366240	the way the characters are done alone, it makes the game outstanding, but just, it's
8366240	8372120	just, I think you said it well when you said you didn't even play it and it was like watching
8372120	8375880	a movie and that's how good it is. I mean, and then do you even take it a step further
8375880	8380480	and actually kind of like get your hands on it and be in control is, is just outstanding.
8380480	8383980	I did actually play a little bit of it. I mean, I'm not going to say I didn't play any
8383980	8388840	of it, but it, it was Dan's save and I had, since I'd seen so much of it, I was like,
8388840	8393120	there's no point, but I might go back and do it myself now. So much to go back for with
8393120	8398800	the Riddler trophies and the little side in the Riddler mission. Oh my God. I barely dented
8398800	8405880	that, which is actually pretty messed up. Yeah. And not that hard. So, all right, so
8405880	8412760	now we're going to go around and get Z number one picks. Oh my gosh, here it is. The game
8412760	8421200	of the year. According to us, Alan portal two, it really elevated the first game and
8421200	8427140	it's very rare for when a sequel makes the game that came before it a better experience.
8427140	8433840	It really showed that valve is a heavy hitter when it comes to casting a voice talent narrative
8433840	8440160	writing and it's a hilarious game. It's an emotional game. You feel sympathetic for both
8440160	8447800	Wheatley and GLaDOS. You would learn so much backstory for pretty much everyone, including
8447800	8453760	even shell, if you know how to look for it. And it's, it's a very it's really just holds
8453760	8457520	on to you to never let's go. It's, it's, it's quick. If once you beat it once, if you love
8457520	8461520	the story so much, you can run through it again in a couple hours and it never feels
8461520	8467880	stale. And it really valve, especially with half-life two episodes, one and two really
8467880	8474720	have tried to increase their game as far as script writing and story being told through
8474720	8478720	dialogue. But portal two is where they're really like, you're going to listen to this
8478720	8483760	and you're going to be invested in these characters. And also here's awesome puzzle, you know,
8483760	8488720	puzzle cracking to where you have to need to figure out what to do. So, all right, well
8488720	8495880	justified. Dark soccer, your number one game of the year. I will answer it with a sound
8495880	8507960	from my phone if it will play. I hope that made it through. It might have a little bit.
8507960	8513360	It's a little quiet, but it made through it's a portal to definitely cause for all the same
8513360	8517840	reasons that Alan said, and I've beaten it 10 times in single player mode, more than
8517840	8522520	10 times now in single player mode, I keep playing through that game. I've probably played
8522520	8528400	through that game once a month and I go and explore and look for stuff. And while I haven't
8528400	8533080	done the no clipping trick to, you know, see how the levels are put together, I still have
8533080	8538480	such a good time every time. And actually, um, I've sat back now and watched, uh, the
8538480	8542780	ending through third player mode. So it's kind of funny seeing these disembodied arms
8542780	8547680	floating about for Chell instead of, you know, seeing her whole body attached to everything,
8547680	8551040	you know, but that's, you know, part of the perspective and part of the camera. So it's
8551040	8557720	very neat and poor Wheatley. And I love that actor so much. I was watching him on Graham
8557720	8563520	Norton one time where he was paid a thousand pounds to be donated to charity to do a somersault
8563520	8570640	on stage and he had never done one before. And this man is tall. This man is like a moose
8570640	8574640	for well, people would get my reference from Supernatural, but anyway, he's tall. He's
8574640	8580800	very tall, very lanky. I think he's taller than you, Alan. Yeah. And just watching how
8580800	8585520	good natured he is and the fact that he brings so much of himself into the character, I thought
8585520	8593000	it was perfect. And you can really hear that fun part, even when Wheatley's being an evil
8593000	8599600	bastard. It's just awesome. So that, and you know, the, the giant mutant potato and all
8599600	8604800	of the reoccurring jokes. And I would even, I even went in and tried to find all the stuff
8604800	8611000	that did make it into the final game, like the Garfield conversation in co-op mode, where
8611000	8617200	apparently two little robots, Atlas and Peabody were supposed to go and find a Garfield comic.
8617200	8623600	And she glad us rewrites it to say that John Arbuckle filled the house with neurotoxin.
8623600	8629680	Too bad it's not Garfield without Garfield. God, that's great. I'll have to find you the
8629680	8635760	little file to play. So, all right. Um, my number one game of the year might surprise
8635760	8643760	some people. Um, but I, I really had to sit back and go. I don't ever, I don't ever beat
8643760	8647640	video games anymore. And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that maybe I play
8647640	8652880	these MMOs games. You can't beat the fact that I do this show, or I just love video
8652880	8657440	games so much that I try to play as many games as possible. So I'm just never, I never have
8657440	8662320	that attention span to play, to finish a game. And I know it's a notorious joke on the show.
8662320	8668880	What bad gamer ADD I have that I never finish games. It's like, Ooh, sparkly. Go that, go
8668880	8674620	here. But there was one game that came out this year that said, sit down and fucking
8674620	8682400	play me till I'm finished. Just dance ABBA. That was the best 30 minutes of my life. Contemplated
8682400	8689200	no, no, it's not just dance ABBA. Shut up. Uh, you can't beat just dance ABBA. Uh, but
8689200	8695020	I have, I was absolutely sucked into this game start to finish. And it's just, it's
8695020	8699520	an amazing fucking video game. And it's, it's the best video game of the year. It's portal
8699520	8704080	to absolutely without question is best video game of the year. And it's, it's, it's everything
8704080	8709160	these two said. And I will emphasize the fact that this game probably still would have been
8709160	8712260	the game of the year without the co-op or the shit that they're, they've been adding
8712260	8716520	to it since then. Haven't even touched COVID. Same. I haven't, I did play a little bit of
8716520	8720480	the co-op. I beat co-op. I play a little bit of it and it's like, you know, that just further
8720480	8726080	enhanced the experience of what was already an amazing game. And you know, the story was,
8726080	8731960	was great. And I have to admit the first game I L I liked, but I didn't like love like dark
8731960	8736720	soccer did or something. But this game, I think as Alan said a minute ago, made the
8736720	8742840	first game that much better. It was so good. So, um, absolutely. Portal twos, my game of
8742840	8748840	the year. So interesting that all three of us picked the same game in portal one, 90%
8748840	8752920	of the story happened in the last, what, two levels of it. And the story up until then
8752920	8756880	you could read the signs and a lot of it was really implied. And then at the end, the finale,
8756880	8761260	when you're doing the big escape, that's where you figure out, Oh, okay. Portal two just
8761260	8764120	hits the ground running. You already know what the story is and it just keeps getting
8764120	8767800	better and better and better and better. Oh yeah. Uh, this is what you wanted me to play
8767800	8773240	dark soccer here. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, you made it to one of the human habitats.
8773240	8779560	We're looking for an artifact. Think of it as an archeological dig. Their laughter centered
8779560	8788080	around one of the objects in this room. That's it. Scan it for me. So this cat loves lasagna
8788080	8794200	so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house. Oh, apparently it's not the cat's
8794200	8804840	house or his lasagna. Oh, good. The man who owns the lasagna is furious. The end. The
8804840	8811360	end. That's not funny. Do either of you feel like laughing? All right. I'm pulling you
8811360	8819460	out. Welcome back. While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon. It's up on the screen.
8819460	8824120	As you can see in my version, the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped
8824120	8829600	with deadly neurotoxin dispensers. That which point the cat reflects on the time he ate
8829600	8838600	all of the man's lasagna and feels remorse briefly. Reactions. Yes. It's funny because
8838600	8845240	most of it actually happened. Do you feel more human? Well, let's do some tests and
8845240	8851400	see what happens. Nice. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, I was telling the chat room earlier,
8851400	8856600	but Dan and I were at Disneyland in line for space mountain going and the best of space.
8856600	8863240	Space. Yeah. I, I, I, again, I stand by what we said earlier. We did not compare lists.
8863240	8866920	So I had no idea that, well, I kind of knew dark soccer will go for portal two is number
8866920	8869480	one. Like, you know, I just, there was no question. I didn't know Alan was going to
8869480	8874080	go there too. So, um, very, very interesting that we all picked the same game. I would
8874080	8880000	say for the first time in 10 years, I think we've all picked the same game, but hold on.
8880000	8883320	Loki's not here. And I kind of don't think Loki's going to go that way. He'd go saints.
8883320	8888220	I think that's on a four. Well, that didn't come out this year. I think that was his game
8888220	8892040	last year. I think he's going to go saints row the third, which admittedly I thought
8892040	8897000	you, I thought it was going to be, Oh, I, it was so fucking, how is Skyrim not on my
8897000	8903480	list? How, how is Skyrim not on my list? It wasn't, it was that good of a year for games.
8903480	8907160	I mean, sky or Skyrim absolutely should be in my top three. I'm kind of don't care about
8907160	8913460	Skyrim, but you, you, you're not really into those types of games though. I wouldn't expect
8913460	8919000	you to like Skyrim yet. All this, all the crap that people do in Skyrim, I tried to
8919000	8924560	do and wow, 50,000 cheese wheels off the side of the mountain, but I tried to like climb
8924560	8928180	every mountain and try to get to places that no one can get to. And, but no, I will admit
8928180	8933040	for quite some time, uh, saints row the third, just because of the fact, just the fun factor
8933040	8939200	part of it, like that I have not laughed that fucking hard at a video game. Well, except
8939200	8942080	maybe portal two. No, I don't even think, I don't think portal two, I laughed as hard
8942080	8946320	as I did as saints row the third. I mean, it's just that fucking good, but it's just,
8946320	8951600	I look back and I go, your three favorites got to make a commitment. And I think Mario
8951600	8958720	edges it out slightly combustible lemons. So there you go. That was the part that cracked
8958720	8964920	me up to no end. I think we'll be able to say portal two is going to end up the official
8964920	8969380	OLR game of the year, just looking at the, uh, uh, feedback and so forth. But I, I Loki
8969380	8972720	needs to have his say, so we'll get his input next week on what he thinks the top three
8972720	8977200	games of the year are. Any guesses for Loki games? I mean, I think we have all said saints
8977200	8982040	row. The third will probably be his number one, but what else for Loki games? Skylanders.
8982040	8985840	I think he'll put Skyrim on there too. I think he'll, I think he'll put, I think he's going
8985840	8992360	to put, what's that battlefield game. He loves battlefield three. No, not battlefield. What
8992360	9000600	am I saying? Like actual battlefield. No. Um, the 1840 or 1940 whatever that he plays
9000600	9006280	with the ants. Oh, modern war. But they play call of duty modern warfare two right now.
9006280	9012680	Oh, I don't know. So we'll, we'll see. I just not Loki loves sandbox games. He loves sandbox
9012680	9016000	games more than anything. So that's why I think it's going to be Skyrim and saints are
9016000	9019800	three saints row the third for sure. Yeah. But I don't know what else is going to have
9019800	9023160	room in there. He'll kind of just say, ah, he'll, he'll just pull it out of his butt.
9023160	9027040	He might go with portal two for like number three. I think he really did enjoy that. So
9027040	9032640	we'll see. Only Loki knows. So he'll be back next week. Trismo five this year. No, I don't
9032640	9038440	think he'd go for that anyway. So I'm thinking more Dan something if, if he could fuck around
9038440	9042780	with it and hack it and stuff, that's the type of stuff he likes. I think his list will
9042780	9049460	be portal to Skyrim and saints row the third, but we'll see. All right. I found you something
9049460	9055400	else to play. You must play it. Oh, act deaf. And I think this is what you were thinking
9055400	9060360	of earth defense force. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Thank you. Good. Good call. Act deaf. Absolutely.
9060360	9064520	Earth defense force will probably be in there. Okay. There's the last thing. It's short.
9064520	9068480	Okay. Oh, what? Oh, you sent me to play. All right. One more thing. All right. Because
9068480	9075040	we love portal so much. All right. Make this quick. I am a whore for portal. Yes. And that
9075040	9080120	made me a hortil. That is earth defense force. Insect Armageddon. Yeah. He'd probably put
9080120	9085160	that on this list. All right. Here we go. I've been thinking when life gives you lemons
9085160	9091840	don't make lemonade. Make life. Take the lemons back. Get mad. I don't want your damn lemons.
9091840	9097120	What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rule the
9097120	9103160	day it thought it could give cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the man
9103160	9108800	who's going to burn your house down with the lemons. I'm going to get my engineers to invent
9108800	9116800	a combustible lemon that burns your house down. Burning people. He says what we're all
9116800	9121760	thinking. All right. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't have the one that had got us on there cause
9121760	9126560	her comments make it extra funny. All right. So there it is. Our game of the year discussion.
9126560	9131520	Hope you guys enjoyed or if you didn't, well, you're welcome to your own opinion. No. Well,
9131520	9136220	we got your plenty of your opinions, uh, on the, I was surprised that only one person
9136220	9141680	said Skyrim. I just, you know, when 72 media outlets say it, I'm kind of surprised, but
9141680	9145000	I think maybe for a lot of people, it's one of those games where it's like Skyrim. It's
9145000	9149280	up there, but it just, it just didn't crack the top three. I was limited by the fact that
9149280	9153600	I play games two to three years late. And the fact that I'm playing Skyrim when it's
9153600	9158560	only three years old is actually kind of amazing. And it's thanks to you getting three months
9158560	9163040	old. Thanks to you getting it for me when it was cheap. All right. All right. Let's
9163040	9166760	move on. Uh, more gaming news for you guys. We've got the mailbag FUs of the week and
9166760	9170960	of course your phone calls coming up in just a little bit. Um, so let's go to Alan with
9170960	9178880	some more news. So there's been a lot of wank going on, uh, lately due to a feisty, um,
9178880	9185000	valve employee who was seen at an event wearing a half life. It's the half life lambda circle
9185000	9191240	logo with a three on it. And people saw that and were like, Ooh, half life three is coming.
9191240	9196800	Um, I'm a huge half life fan. And for those listening who don't remember half life to
9196800	9204080	proper came out in 2004, um, nearly 10 years ago and half life to episode two came out
9204080	9208360	in the orange box, which I believe when it, that was what, September of seven when portal
9208360	9214560	one came out. Yeah. So that's pushing, um, four or five years now. So people are like
9214560	9221080	valve, what is going on with half life three or at least half life to episode three. Thanks
9221080	9227200	to this t-shirt people thought, um, it's, it's coming. Like this is, this is a tease.
9227200	9234520	Um, ultimately, uh, Chet Falisek, who is a writer for half life and left for dead. And
9234520	9239720	he also occasionally hits up the official forums has said that all of the rumors that
9239720	9244240	the half life community on the official forums has sort of dredged out and saying that valve
9244240	9249240	is working up to something. There's an, there's an alternate reality game similar to what
9249240	9254200	portal two had when they updated the ending to portal one, where you call into like modems
9254200	9259920	and you download all of these images, all the, the portal two stuff, it's all trolling.
9259920	9265080	It's all trolling by half life fans like myself, just trolling the shadow of each other. Um,
9265080	9270320	there's no official ARG or if there is, of course it's, it's one of those sort of, you
9270320	9276600	can kind of see through the, the subtext of his response saying, uh, you know, uh, this
9276600	9280720	is his official response. You, you are being trolled. There is no ARG Wheatley speech was
9280720	9286120	set in portal two fiction. That is all. There has been no directive from Gabe to leak anything.
9286120	9291800	That is all false. So I would imagine there is something to leak, but you know, it's,
9291800	9297560	it's all under lock and key by valve. I'm finishing his quote. I just want to say, I
9297560	9302080	just want to say this. So there is no confusion. This is the community trolling the community.
9302080	9306080	Nothing more while it is nice to see people excited about anything half life. I hate seeing
9306080	9311480	people be trolled like this. Thanks. So what we get out of this story is valve is still
9311480	9316440	committed to half life. It's still going to take them a couple of years to put out any
9316440	9319880	sequel. They haven't canceled. Obviously it's their bread and butter. It's the reason why
9319880	9323820	valve is the company is it is, but all of this stuff that we're seeing right now to
9323820	9328920	do that employee with his t-shirt, it's all just trolling. They aren't, they aren't ready.
9328920	9334720	How does that make you feel as a half life fan? Oh, frustrated. But you kind of knew,
9334720	9338920	right? The minute you saw the shirt, I think you even said to me, somebody's just trolling
9338920	9344380	better than he came out and said it. Yeah, that's true. Just leaving it to speculation.
9344380	9349600	Even if he did get disciplined for it, it probably, you know, it's not a fireable offense
9349600	9354240	for him to make a custom t-shirt that he knew was going to get the fandom to, you know,
9354240	9358740	lose their minds. And even if he did get in trouble for it, we're not, we're not privy
9358740	9363780	to that information. It's none of our business. And plus how could valve not be doing half
9363780	9367480	life three eventually, you know, like you said, it's their bread and butter and it's
9367480	9372560	like, it's just, they probably just keep going back and changing stuff. I don't know. I kind
9372560	9377960	of think it's coming soon. They're like, what else is left for valve to do? Unless it's
9377960	9382360	well, they're doing defense defense, defense of the ancients. That's in beta. Now defense
9382360	9387320	is going to be out before he three. So what's valve got to talk about at E3 this year? Left
9387320	9392580	for dead three. Well, I shouldn't say that cause I mean, it's not like left for dead
9392580	9396440	is a bad franchise. Or if they came out and said portal three, I think we'd all blow a
9396440	9401360	load. You know, that would be great. But maybe it's a little too soon for portal three. You
9401360	9406840	know, I would, even though I'm not as into half life as you, I'm kind of like, okay,
9406840	9411400	give the half life fan, throw them a fucking bone. Let this be their year. 2012 is the
9411400	9415680	end of the world after all. Let them have their goddamn half life. It was six years
9415680	9420640	between one and two and it's now it's eight between two and conceivably three if they
9420640	9424200	would say anything about it. So it's just like, we know that you're working on it. We
9424200	9428640	just want throw us a bone. And they're like, no, we're not ready. They're like blizzard.
9428640	9431720	They're not going to tell a shit. And this is all just trolling that's going on right
9431720	9438160	now. All right. At least you'll have defense of the ancients to hold you over. No one curve.
9438160	9443540	All right. Uh, moving on to what I find to be kind of an interesting thing that happened.
9443540	9448960	This has to do with the game fallout new Vegas. And I guess what happened is that the lead
9448960	9457360	designer behind fallout new Vegas actually released a mod to go with the game. Uh, it's
9457360	9461240	not an official patch because, and of course now the source story isn't loading for me,
9461240	9466560	but I read it earlier and the official patch, uh, or they didn't want to officially patch
9466560	9470880	it because it was changing the games in ways that they may not want to subject everybody
9470880	9476720	to in terms of balancing and so on. So I think it's interesting that they, uh, kind of did
9476720	9479560	it this way without doing an official mod. There we go. Now the story is loaded for me
9479560	9488040	here. Um, you can download this mod direct from lead designer J E Sawyer and his website
9488040	9496500	is Diogenes dash lamp dot info slash J Sawyer underscore FNV underscore mod.zip. But yeah,
9496500	9502560	it's for fallout new Vegas. It will, uh, turn up the difficulty, uh, putting it up there
9502560	9507120	to what he wanted in terms of difficulty. Hence part of the reasons why they don't want
9507120	9511000	to put it out there for everybody. And he also just kind of said, you know what, the
9511000	9514120	game's over, the ship sailed, nobody's working on it anymore. There's no testers, there's
9514120	9518800	nothing. This is just me doing what I want to do in my free time. So fallout new Vegas
9518800	9523680	is done. So hold out hope for fallout four, I suppose, which would, I would think going
9523680	9527740	to be their next game. Now that Skyrim is out there, I'll let new Vegas is pretty, pretty
9527740	9533720	good. I have to say. Yeah. So there you go. There is by the way, an ultimate edition of
9533720	9538320	fallout new Vegas coming out on February 7th. That's, but that's just all the DLC from fallout
9538320	9543640	new Vegas originally all put together in one little package there. All righty, let's go
9543640	9551640	to the mailbag. Yes. Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge trader
9551640	9556400	dot com and dark soccer threatens to not read them, but then we beat her until she does
9556400	9562120	beat, beat, beat that bat, bat, bat, bat. Okay. I'm going to treat you like a Justin
9562120	9570600	Bieber pinata. Those things were hideous. Just some paper plates and party hats stapled
9570600	9576080	together. Okay. So the first email comes from Robert M. Somehow I get the feeling that Jamie
9576080	9579760	if she's in studio tonight has already seen this. What were you anticipating when I was
9579760	9586960	definitely not being here, but I mean I wasn't really seriously thinking of calling in. Okay.
9586960	9590280	If so, please post this link to the chat room and stop reading this now. Otherwise here's
9590280	9595760	a pro toy, a customizer's version of the metal slug tank. Best of luck in the year ahead.
9595760	9601080	And yeah, I, um, I did see this and I will post it in the chat room and if Rama will
9601080	9607160	be so kind as to, uh, put this picture and the link to the article on, uh, our tumble
9607160	9614960	bubble. That's a little Lego. It's a Lego. It's cute. Uh, metal slug. Yeah. So I will
9614960	9621720	post this in the chat room now. You know, also this music makes me kind of wish I was
9621720	9629720	going on the Matterhorn cause it's kind of the same. Anyway, so this is comes from Holly
9629720	9633120	D. Hey guys, I just wanted to share something that popped into my head when I heard about
9633120	9637320	the poor guys on your show who have had their Xbox live impose screwed with, particularly
9637320	9640880	the guy who said he gave them information to investigate and then they said his credentials
9640880	9645360	weren't right even though they hadn't changed since he opened the case. We had a similar
9645360	9649100	experience with Comcast over my internet bill except it wasn't a hacking. It was customer
9649100	9654000	service fail. I switched to internet and cable from internet service. Well, next time I called
9654000	9657760	to check the installation time was from my number. I gave it and they told me I was wrong.
9657760	9661800	I was like WTF. The first one pretty much hung up on me. So I called back again. This
9661800	9665000	woman told me she could not access the account with me even though I was calling about an
9665000	9668220	appointment I obviously knew already. I argued with this woman for an hour and she finally
9668220	9672640	found that my account had been closed and then the guy who set up the new service opened
9672640	9676720	a new one and put in some bs number. So I had to reopen the old account, but she kept
9676720	9680840	insisting that I had to go physically to one of their locations to fix it. I said like
9680840	9684640	hell I was and I pointed out to her that if they weren't allowed to change the number,
9684640	9688240	then who the hell gave him permission to change it in the first place. So she should could
9688240	9692080	clearly see it had changed. After that she put me on the phone with her supervisor who
9692080	9697540	fixed it. Took about two hours total. The basic point of this is to say that is to say
9697540	9701140	try to point out the flaws in their logic and demand who know who authorized changing
9701140	9704640	the information. It gets results sometimes because you know if they're claiming they
9704640	9709600	can't change it, then they sure as hell know who authorized the first change. I hope it
9709600	9715600	helps and I hope they get their accounts back soon, Holly D. Yeah. You know what happened
9715600	9720440	with Comcast with us? We were supposed to have everything fixed on Thursday and Dan
9720440	9725760	the night before, Dan had a phone call, an automated phone call that said Thursday and
9725760	9729520	Dan had taken Thursday off work. Well then he goes to check it in the morning and it
9729520	9737520	said Friday when Dan had to be at work. So he called me. I told him to call his supervisor,
9737520	9743280	but I was also you know seven in the morning and asleep. So I just want to say Comcast
9743280	9749120	automation, these automations and computers and stuff just leads to trouble. It's a problem.
9749120	9754200	Fail is what it is. She had to talk to a human being to get anything done. Well, no, he Dan
9754200	9758980	tried to talk to a human being and she wouldn't change it. Hey guys, it's Blade3 again. Just
9758980	9763680	wanted to say sorry about my grammar a couple of weeks. I'm, I gave everyone a hard time.
9763680	9770040	She gives everyone shit. But use a period after I go please. I was on a PSP 2000 semicolon
9770040	9776000	and comma. That's wrong. By the way, I was wondering what studio equipment you use and
9776000	9780300	setting up a recording studio and I was curious that should have a you in it about your mics
9780300	9789280	and whatnot. Please keep it IP I guess it is it up the awesome work. Well, it's not
9789280	9793240	as complicated as you think the setup. I know for a show that's been around as long as we
9793240	9797100	have you think we'd have this fancy thing going on, but it's actually not that complicated.
9797100	9800840	Our first board came off the eBay. Yeah, the first board came off of eBay. The board we're
9800840	9804520	using right now. We did upgrade to a newer board some time ago and I'll tell you it's
9804520	9812540	what's called a Euro rack. Yeah, it's by Beringer. You be one two two two fx Pro. There are pictures
9812540	9815260	if you look at the new studio pictures or as long as you do.com you can see the mixing
9815260	9819520	board sitting there in the background. It's really as simple as we have three microphones
9819520	9823500	and they're all hodgepodge microphones. I'll take a picture and put it up right. I've got
9823500	9828780	a RadioShack in my hand. Yeah, Loki's is from RadioShack dark soccer is a Beringer mic that
9828780	9832580	I think she picked up when she picked up the board. Yeah, mine was donated by DDR Angel
9832580	9837100	like eight years ago and it still works. She's like this is an expensive mic and I want you
9837100	9840480	guys to have it and it still works. This is actually I bought this one because my old
9840480	9845420	mic died. Well, the DDR Angel mic is also a backup mic because it is sold. We actually
9845420	9848460	had another mic that broke and then you've got your courthouse one in the other room.
9848460	9852020	Yeah, I know what that one's from. They all I think it's another RadioShack mic but they
9852020	9856700	all it's like a newer RadioShack mic. Yeah, so they all plug into the board and then you
9856700	9861340	know every mic that I've bought I've gotten at Guitar Center. Ah, and every mic I think
9861340	9865740	I've got at RadioShack maybe one at Fry's but anyway they all plug into the board. We
9865740	9870760	try to equalize things on the board. I realize our voices are not always equalized. We try
9870760	9877020	best we can to adjust things on the fly but unfortunately sometimes some of my co-hosts
9877020	9882540	especially Dark Soccer and Loki tend to be very quiet if they're in a bad mood. Ah, and
9882540	9888920	then they get very excited. Loki's worse though. I can talk about him because he's not here.
9888920	9894620	Loki's a lot worse. By the way, look at our website and our little photos at top. I just
9894620	9902100	sent a picture of the computer and the soundboard. By themselves. And the computer was donated
9902100	9908140	by the listeners. The monitor is from Dan's mom. It's okay when Dan's grandmom got a new
9908140	9913760	computer we took the monitor. So that's one of our spare monitors. So it's just a simple
9913760	9918580	flat screen monitor and the computer was donated by the listeners which was an awesome gesture.
9918580	9923020	That was when I had the DevaFit one episode and I stormed off the set because what had
9923020	9927380	happened? I think the show just kind of died in the middle like we were having the computer
9927380	9932100	didn't the sound card? Sound card went out and wrapped in the middle of the show. I think
9932100	9936780	the graphic card went out too. And then somebody in chat just you know sometimes and they you
9936780	9941040	know and the person apologized to me afterwards so I don't mean to like dig up this four year
9941040	9945220	old drama but it was you know just unfortunately say the wrong thing at the wrong moment and
9945220	9953060	I just fucking lost it. And you know it was a moment when Travis called me the next day
9953060	9959120	to go that was the best thing that has ever happened on OLR. And Travis doesn't say nice
9959120	9965380	things about OLR very often. But he called me to say Rob that was the best thing you
9965380	9971880	ever did on OLR. But the listeners after hearing that actually pulled together and bought a
9971880	9977920	new computer and we use it to this day. I was in studio Dark Sakura when the show computer
9977920	9981940	before this one it was going to be my I think my second or third guest appearance on OLR
9981940	9990100	was when we had just started dating where the old show computer died. It went to put
9990100	9995540	old show. That's the that's the one that the fans put together for you. It was the old
9995540	10001180	big one. Oh in this in the garage studio. No no no. It was that it was it. No we we've
10001180	10005780	had this one since then. It must be something most of the laptop. This this one. This was
10005780	10010660	the computer that we got at my house. Right. Then we had the blue one the white and blue
10010660	10016220	one that was a fan donation. No no no. That was my donation. That was yours. That's right.
10016220	10020300	But that's the one that crapped out on that show. Yeah. That caused me to lose it. No
10020300	10024300	because it was five thirty and you were firing up the computer and getting everything ready
10024300	10029860	and it just it would it died. It stopped. Oh yeah. Something happened right before we
10029860	10034180	got it. No that was we were able to fix it. We were able to fix it. Something it was something
10034180	10037660	we found out later on was like a setting or something was screwed up but we were able
10037660	10043640	to fix it. But it just screwed the show that night. So. And yeah and also the this sound
10043640	10048340	board that you guys have just goes into the line in on your sound card and then you guys
10048340	10054300	use what audition for the yeah we use audition for the for the podcasting itself. Yeah. Yeah.
10054300	10058140	The mixing board goes into the computer through the line in and then it's all recorded straight
10058140	10063160	in Adobe Audition. I'll tell you the secret that a lot of people kind of wonder about
10063160	10068520	is that how do we have the Skype and the music and everything all through the same sound
10068520	10072440	like we you know it's sometimes it's kind of hard to do. You have to have a really nice
10072440	10076540	sound card just get a nice sound card and we have a sound blaster card has to be capable
10076540	10082220	of what you hear. Yes you need something that's called what you with the letter U here and
10082220	10086780	the what you hear component on the sound card is what allows us to do Skype calls without
10086780	10093700	call graph do you know just have everything plug into the external mixer. My old laptop
10093700	10100220	had the capability except for that card it was actually listed as speaker output. So
10100220	10104300	so yeah well different sound cards anything that came in you want to have it set to anything
10104300	10108480	that's going to come out of the speaker. I think somebody explained it to me as you want
10108480	10112860	a full duplex card and not a half duplex card because full duplex is what's capable in and
10112860	10117140	out at the same time. Yes that's very important to spend if you're going to do podcast your
10117140	10120740	computer spend the extra money to get a nicer sound card and you'll be set. My nice awesome
10120740	10125500	quad core computer doesn't have a sound card that does that but my old crappy laptop does.
10125500	10132980	Yeah weird. So in the chat dark Tetsuya says oh I think he had that clip on under station
10132980	10138620	live not too long after there's a clip. Oh Lord. Well I got it probably was all recorded
10138620	10143020	on Justin T.V. because we were or did Justin T.V. go out when the rest of it went out.
10143020	10148000	I remember we were using Justin T.V. I don't remember. I will because we were in the garage
10148000	10153940	studio when that happened. Yeah I think Justin T.V. was out but I don't remember. It was
10153940	10160020	so long ago now I'm sure that clip will show up soon enough though. And Rama says it sound
10160020	10163900	blaster autogy or better. That's what you're going to want out of a card. Anyway that's
10163900	10168700	my very long winded memory lane answer to that short question. Well we have one last
10168700	10177780	email. And actually it's from well I didn't I'm just gonna say from Nigel. Here's an article
10177780	10181900	from the Guardian UK national newspaper. I read the Guardian all the time. So yeah that
10181900	10189100	might interest one dark Sakura. And here it is playing video games makes me sick is what
10189100	10199020	it's called. And from I scammed it over and I'll go ahead and read this bit of the paragraph.
10199020	10205020	You know and he's talking about playing Modern Warfare 3. This is he says I'm insanely jealous
10205020	10208460	because I can't play it. This isn't because I haven't got a necessary game console or
10208460	10212580	don't like shooting people. I have and I do. After a mere 30 minutes of playing them I
10212580	10217140	have to run to the bathroom to throw up. I'm not alone either. Where there is little research
10217140	10222020	into video games and what has been called simulation sickness estimates suggest that
10222020	10226880	between 10 percent and 50 percent of people may suffer to various degrees. For me it was
10226880	10233140	triggered from the first time I played such a game the PlayStation classic Doom in 1995.
10233140	10238540	And for me the pixel games don't do it to me that badly. You know like Doom. But if
10238540	10248220	you the worst game that ever did it to me was Goldeneye on Nintendo 64. That game would
10248220	10253980	make me so sick. I couldn't watch because Dan was playing through it at the time and
10253980	10260200	he loves that game and I wanted to love it. I really did. Nope sick. I couldn't play unreal.
10260200	10266620	I couldn't play the newer quakes because anything that was actually 3D would make me sick. Katamari
10266620	10272660	made me super sick. Portal makes me way sick because it doesn't have that fast reorientation
10272660	10278480	the way that Portal 2 does. So Portal 2 made me sick at first but I could get used to it.
10278480	10282240	And now I can play it with no problem. I mean I do have to stop every few levels and let
10282240	10286580	my eyes readjust. But I can't play the first Portal for very long at all because it will
10286580	10291180	make me very nauseous. Technically you're supposed to do that with any game anyway every
10291180	10295000	you know 30 minutes or so. How many people do that Rob? Well I'm just saying you're supposed
10295000	10298940	to and there's a reason. Well I'm usually also multitasking. I'm talking to people while
10298940	10306780	I'm playing Portal. So. But yeah. But basically it's just. Here's another thing. It says the
10306780	10311260	US Army Research Institute for Behavioral Social Science also studied flight simulators
10311260	10315820	and found that slightly fewer than half of pilots using them reported symptoms similar
10315820	10321500	to motion sickness. So this is actually super cool and I would also. In fact I'm gonna link
10321500	10327780	this in the chat room as well because I think that other people will benefit from this.
10327780	10334660	Spazinator you can shut the fuck up. Spazinator by the way said want to play some Goldeneye.
10334660	10338780	But to be fair he did put colon P which means he isn't serious. I know. All right. And I
10338780	10346020	wasn't serious although. But yeah I just would get so sick. And I get a little motion sick
10346020	10355180	in a car if I'm not driving. But yeah. All right. That it for emails. You know what.
10355180	10363180	I do not complain every other second. So AGN 728. Bite me. Bite me. That's not a complaint.
10363180	10366460	That's a command. You should complain about the fact that they can't be bothered to change
10366460	10375100	your nickname. Yeah. All right. Moving on. I wonder if that's for Angry Gaming Nerd maybe.
10375100	10378940	But no it's somebody that's coming from all games radio all games network. They're in
10378940	10383260	the all games chat as opposed to the chat that orange on radio. You didn't have to kick
10383260	10388580	him. What you kick him for. I can handle my own back. I'm a grown woman. I can fight my
10388580	10393780	own battles. Now look at that. Despite all that she's got your back. Despite all that
10393780	10398340	she's done all that. You need to slap one with the trout right now to kick him myself.
10398340	10402460	I mean no I'm kidding. I wouldn't have done that. I will. I'm a good girl. I will slap
10402460	10407980	Rama with the trout for you. Thank you. There you go. All right. We need to. We actually
10407980	10412780	I wish we could change that to like with large boobs or something. All right. Moving on.
10412780	10419900	OK. We've got to move on. The week. Oh speaking of complaints. What a perfect time for us
10419900	10444300	to do our normal segment of the. Um really my my complaint. Fuck you to moving because
10444300	10450940	moving is awful. I mean I like being in the new house that isn't falling apart like my
10450940	10460100	old house was. I hate paying rent now but I really like being in the new place and it's
10460100	10464780	just the soreness and the pain that comes with all the moving and not really just the
10464780	10470060	physical stuff but the emotional side of it too because I mean Dan and I lived at that
10470060	10475980	old house. We got married living in that old house. We had lots of wonderful fights in
10475980	10483100	that old house. We've done lots of other things in that house. Sure. He's pooped on it. You
10483100	10486740	know how many. Sure. He hasn't pooped on this house yet. Prayed in that house is what you
10486740	10498540	meant to say. Yeah. Rob I've prayed. I prayed a lot. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. No. But I mean
10498540	10503140	there and on top of that that house before you know we rented from our friends and they
10503140	10507380	got married in the backyard of that house. Oh wow. So I mean we have lots of memories
10507380	10514260	of going over there to visit our friends too. You know a decade of memories of that house.
10514260	10518540	So you know we're going to miss our neighbors. We told them where we love those. We literally
10518540	10524620	moved three blocks away. But I have to add a thank you to Dan for this morning when he
10524620	10530140	kind of woke me up when he was about to leave. He said you don't have to do anything today.
10530140	10537460	You have my full blessing to stay in bed all day or play well all day if you want to. You
10537460	10543940	I will not expect a single tour out of you. So I got up and did the dishes. No I did the
10543940	10548700	dishes when I got up because I just wanted my coffee cup. Chiggers and chat says that
10548700	10553620	would suck moving all those pinball machines. Well Dan did all that. So we have we have
10553620	10560220	this kind of Jack thing. It's got a big flat metal platform on top and you put it under
10560220	10567340	the table and you jack it up like a car jack. He had the jacket. But you can it lifts the
10567340	10571700	whole table up so that you can move it on this wheeled object so that in and of itself
10571700	10577500	isn't isn't very heavy and you can raise it to the level of a truck and slide it in. Wow.
10577500	10582220	So that's the science that the refrigerator was harder to move because we had to take
10582220	10585700	the doors off the house and the doors off the refrigerator to get the damn thing in.
10585700	10594700	All right. We got to move on with the. OK. All right. Alan. Oh boy. It's a new year.
10594700	10601620	It's when people set arbitrary expectations on life changes you know resolutions and I'm
10601620	10606220	like really fat right now. So if you've been really out of shape and waiting the most I've
10606220	10615380	ever waited my life. I blame happiness. It's relationship weight. Yeah I'm so miserable.
10615380	10620860	No speak being unemployed and you know it's apparently done wonders for my appetite that
10620860	10626980	I don't need. So I just need to lose weight. That happened though when I first moved out
10626980	10632420	here and moved in with Dan. I went from a size 12 which I don't care I've always had
10632420	10641300	some but to me to a 24. So I think Rob's accurate. I mean it happens when you're not working
10641300	10648500	relationship with a lot of stuff involved. And you're certainly not a size 24 anymore.
10648500	10656860	No I lost 60 pounds. Yeah. All right. So and when I was helping do like volunteer crew
10656860	10663060	for room loud the rock band fundraiser. It's fine now but for like a day or two after for
10663060	10667460	a good two weeks my right knee was hurting because I guess I picked something up wrong
10667460	10672100	better than my back which is injured. But it's OK now. And it's like I mean you're getting
10672100	10677860	old with stuff up means you're out of shape and you know getting old. So just being out
10677860	10684380	of shape and overweight. My view of the week. I don't know I don't really have a lot because
10684380	10688980	shit I'm on vacation right now and I I have an extra week off. I don't have to go back
10688980	10693460	tomorrow like most people do. So and I'm going to Disneyland. Shit life's pretty fucking
10693460	10698500	good right now. So if you do the fact that it all has to end sometime if you're not taking
10698500	10707940	me. Well if you do you for for not being taken. I don't know. All right. Heart heart heart.
10707940	10711020	That's it. That's it for the if he's the week. All right. Just a couple more stories for
10711020	10714460	you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line and take your Twitter topics. I
10714460	10717940	don't think we have a lot of Twitter Twitter topics yet but we'll see Twitter dot com slash
10717940	10724820	O L R. But first just a couple quick stories for you guys. Alan. Team meet to make the
10724820	10731180	amazing sort of God. I know right. So you see act deaf in chat. Yeah. That you took
10731180	10738080	an arrow to the knee. Yes. And I have I have a sneeze on deck so I'm going to try and burn
10738080	10742760	through this story. Team meet released a game called the Binding of Isaac and it's the same
10742760	10750140	art as Super Meat Boy which is a great retro game that made a lot of top 10 lists for this
10750140	10755740	year. The Binding of Isaac it's currently available on PC via steam. They're in talks
10755740	10763180	to bring it to the 3DS via their 3DS app store. And you were just playing VVVVV on the 3DS
10763180	10767860	different developer but it's still a steam indie game now available on a handheld. And
10767860	10773020	so yeah. Team Meat is trying to bring the Binding of Isaac which I guess is a roguelike
10773020	10780660	dungeon crawler game has some biblical story points to it. And apparently it's really awesome
10780660	10784620	kind of gross. But Super Meat Boy was kind of gross too has the same art style. Look
10784620	10790020	for it on the 3DS. Maybe they're in talks and that is interesting. Very interesting.
10790020	10792540	I kind of like where that's going if a lot of those indie games are suddenly going to
10792540	10797820	show up on 3DS. They wanted to bring Super Meat Boy to the Wii but the limitations on
10797820	10803700	the patching and how big I think the max file size could be. They couldn't do it so the
10803700	10807300	fact that they're still talking to Nintendo trying to get their next game after Super
10807300	10818500	Meat Boy 2 the 3DS is a great sign. Awesome. Yeah. Alright. And lastly tonight a story
10818500	10824180	that is kind of one of those things you sort of saw coming. Online passes it's all the
10824180	10828740	rage in the industry right? It's happening on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. If you want
10828740	10832580	to play a game online and you didn't buy it new you're going to have to buy an extra
10832580	10837300	little pass. Well guess what? It's coming to the Playstation Vita as well. Yes it was
10837300	10843660	confirmed that Hot Shots Golf World Invitational it requires an online pass. New copies have
10843660	10847660	a code that comes with it but an online pass is purchased through the Playstation Network
10847660	10852560	if you have a used or a downloaded copy. Now this was amended later on because I guess
10852560	10856300	at first they were like oh shit if you download it you have to get the online pass as well
10856300	10861540	but it actually was updated to say that hold on the online pass is actually already included
10861540	10865780	when you download it on Playstation Network so you don't have to download it separately
10865780	10872540	just to be fair. So the online passes though they are going over to the PS Vita. Now the
10872540	10880680	online pass will cost 900 yen for Hot Shots Golf that's about $11.50 US so you can expect
10880680	10890180	$10 probably to be about the same price here in the US. So well I guess it's probably not
10890180	10896820	surprising to hear right? Yeah alright. Let's go to the phones. We're going to open up the
10896820	10902740	phones right now. I'm sorry I was doing my hair. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype
10902740	10907100	is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to go to the Twitter topics real quick and read some
10907100	10911900	of the stories and things you guys want to talk about. Not a whole lot of feedback this
10911900	10918740	week. Didn't get a lot through the week probably because of the holidays but let's see. Redertainment
10918740	10924180	tweeted us saying voting is live for the 4th annual the 4 star awards. Well I don't know
10924180	10929540	what is that? Is that like your own personal? What is the 4 star awards? I don't know. And
10929540	10936340	we're not nominated. Granted there's no podcast category but we should be nominated for movie
10936340	10946100	of the year. Whatever it's on Facebook if you want to check it out. Alright. We'll pimp
10946100	10952180	out any awards show what the hell. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10952180	10955940	Tigerclaw sent us a couple quick tweets here. I read about one of these earlier. He sent
10955940	10960580	us a tweet about dude turned swap note into an RPG. I have to admit I didn't pick this
10960580	10965620	story for tonight because I wasn't sure how to explain it. It's a YouTube it's 9 minutes
10965620	10969100	long so I'm not going to play the entire YouTube for you guys but some guy if you don't know
10969100	10975240	what swap note is it came out on the 3DS this week. It's a system that lets you basically
10975240	10980060	exchange emails except instead of written emails they're little actual written handwritten
10980060	10983820	notes that you can send to other people but as you use swap note more you can start to
10983820	10988500	send 5 second messages or pictures. I actually sent to all the people on my friends list
10988500	10993780	on 3DS I sent a picture of Maruko one of the cats here and sent it out. So you know it's
10993780	10997340	kind of like a fun way to share things. It's like oh wow Nintendo is actually embracing
10997340	11001720	the internet for something. Well somebody actually turned it into a full fledged RPG
11001720	11005460	in the vein of Dungeons and Dragons. And I guess there's even like a Dungeon Master template
11005460	11009660	you can use and he talks about all this in his YouTube on how he did it. Again it's a
11009660	11014740	little long for me to play here but it's MNC Dover is the username on YouTube if you want
11014740	11021400	to look that up for yourself. Alright and one other tweet here from Tigerclaw. Epic
11021400	11029620	Games scores a victory against Silicon Knights in a Two Human suit. And I don't even remember
11029620	11032620	what this suit was all about so I'm loading the story now. He's linked us to a story at
11032620	11040300	the multiplayer blog at MTV.com. And let's see. Two Human was supposed to be the start
11040300	11044480	of the next great expansive RPG franchise and reasons that gamers will want in Xbox
11044480	11049980	360 back in the early days. The Silicon Knights developed game was supposed to be a big deal
11049980	11054980	but the game was delayed for two years. The critical response to the game was less enthusiastic
11054980	11059900	and what was intended to be a trilogy was Dead on Arrival with just 130,000 units sold
11059900	11065260	and Microsoft ending their agreement with Silicon Knights. I guess Silicon sued Epic
11065260	11071060	Games over Two Human saying that Epic misrepresented the functionality of the Unreal Engine which
11071060	11076980	was used for Two Human resulting in the two year delay. Wow interesting. Well the case
11076980	11082540	against Epic Games took a blow because one of the key witnesses was excluded from giving
11082540	11088060	testimony after a ruling by Judge James Denver the third. The testimony was going to break
11088060	11093420	it down into dollars and cents terms what the negative impact of working with the Unreal
11093420	11098040	Engine was supposed to have on Silicon Knights but the testimony was found to be questionable
11098040	11102420	and that the methods did not fit the facts of the case. Interesting. I didn't realize
11102420	11105820	there was all this drama going on. Of course this was a game that wasn't on my radar and
11105820	11108820	maybe the fact that it wasn't on my radars you know part of the reason why I didn't sell
11108820	11113900	so good but there you go. Alright anyhow let's go to the phones and take some calls. Hi you're
11113900	11123020	on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Oh hey you don't sound so good try again. Who's this?
11123020	11129580	Is it just me that doesn't hear that at all? It's really. You sound like a Dalek. I can't.
11129580	11133940	I'm hoping oh god I hope that's it was Zaku obviously that was calling in he might have
11133940	11138420	been able to make that out but I can't I couldn't understand him at all. No neither could I.
11138420	11141820	Now was that his connection or was that ours? See now all these things I'm going to question
11141820	11148480	is that the new studio set up so let me just see real quick here. Real quick here. Hello
11148480	11152860	welcome to Skype call testing service. See that works fine. Hello British lady. Hello
11152860	11156140	British lady. Let's see if maybe this next call sounds a little cleaner. Hi you're on
11156140	11162660	Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hello Derek H. Hi Derek H. See I can understand Derek
11162660	11168860	just fine. Our last call was a little weird. Alright anyhow Derek what's on your mind buddy?
11168860	11173660	I would like to talk about video games I've called you guys too. There's this thing called
11173660	11177500	Steam I don't know if you've heard of it that they have like a. Oh a friend was telling
11177500	11182220	me about Steam. We don't play games. I play board games. We sure eat a lot of food though.
11182220	11187740	Would you like to play some Risk or maybe Axis and Allies? I was thinking more about
11187740	11196460	Wits and Wagers maybe. So Steam yes yes I've heard of Steam. I've had Steam for a long
11196460	11205820	time and I only buy games when they're like. Whoa whoa whoa Derek you cut out if you can
11205820	11213060	hear me you like totally cut out. It sounds like what the hell's going on? It's like the
11213060	11224700	void of calls. Your voice like dropped out so did your mic come unplugged or something?
11224700	11228100	Hello trying Derek again one two three. I see that we're still connected it's not an
11228100	11233500	internet thing but he just the voice dropped out. I don't even know if he can hear us.
11233500	11239340	He hung up. That's a bummer. I don't even know what he was about to say about Steam
11239340	11243180	but I think it was like I only buy games when and I'm thinking it was maybe when they're
11243180	11247960	on sale. Yeah dirt cheap maybe. Maybe it was going to lead to a question about is that
11247960	11251740	bad that for the industry? I don't know let's see. I just want to make sure here real quick
11251740	11258220	let's just let's just maybe this studio is a bad omen for calls. Let's see. Hello welcome
11258220	11263380	to Skype call testing service. She works fine. After the beep please record a message. Afterwards
11263380	11268860	your message will be played back to you. Hi I'm doing really professional internet radio
11268860	11276360	right now and I am testing a Skype connection live. I love you British lady. On the air.
11276360	11281100	This is all dark soccer's fault. Hi I'm doing really professional internet radio right now
11281100	11291340	and I am. See it's fine. What's up. You know what's up is this delicious stew. It's amazing.
11291340	11296140	Thank you so much. Pop is just put in front of my mouth begging me to eat. What is what
11296140	11305240	did you make here. It's just stew cubed stew beef small red potatoes carrots and I actually
11305240	11310500	cut up two blood oranges and threw them in there and I can taste this I can taste it
11310500	11317140	too. Yeah I used a peeler to get the rind the orange zest. All right. So it's it's Orange
11317140	11327860	Lounge do do. Oh my God we're breaking up. I've had that in my head like all night. All
11327860	11333260	right let's move on to another call. Maybe this one will work. Hi you're on orange already.
11333260	11337940	Who's this. It's Shane. OK. So far we can hear you and you're not a robot. So that's
11337940	11343020	good. Hi Shane. Awesome. I'm not a robot. That's cool. What's on your mind Shane. I
11343020	11349180	don't know. I was calling to see if your stuff would work. Pretty much. Well only the collar
11349180	11356340	appears to be broken this time. You need to come play with me on the Horde server. Oh
11356340	11360480	but there's so much Star Wars going on right now. All right. You know what. Pooh on that.
11360480	11363980	Then let's talk Star Wars. Because you were just telling me earlier you do nothing but
11363980	11368560	play Star Wars now. Yeah it's really sad. I came on here and I said you know I like
11368560	11372900	Star Wars and I don't like Star Wars for these particular reasons. So what are your
11372900	11376740	thoughts on Star Wars The Old Republic. Well first of all I'd like to say I did not listen
11376740	11380380	to what you said about why you like it and why you do not. So I don't know if I'm going
11380380	11387500	to copy you or anything but I like it because the story is really cool and I don't know
11387500	11394620	anything about Star Wars so this is all new to me. Like every single last thing. OK I'm
11394620	11397900	still there I hear like stuff in the background. Yeah we're just eating we're stuffing our
11397900	11404140	face while you're talking. Oh that's what I was eating long questions. That wasn't a
11404140	11411300	very long question. All right. I don't like it because it doesn't feel polished still
11411300	11416900	which is expected because it's such a new game. But you know that will come with time.
11416900	11421300	Wow wasn't that great at vanilla. I played it a little bit but I'm really digging it
11421300	11427280	like there's plot twists and every single class so far has been really fun to play which
11427280	11432180	I can't say the same for well but I do love well I'm in a year commitment with wow I have
11432180	11435860	like fully paid off with time card so I don't really care if I'm not playing it right now
11435860	11442140	so but I'm really enjoying Star Wars I just got a ship on one of my characters and it's
11442140	11459780	pretty cool. I mean. So describe the glasses for us. Oh my God you pigs. OK. There's dinner.
11459780	11463260	Well that's what I was doing and then I thought I would call it help to make sure your Skype
11463260	11468060	was working. Why wait no no no hold on. I got another question for you. OK. OK. My question
11468060	11472940	is what is supposed to happen in the end game of Star Wars like I don't know because I can't
11472940	11477960	even figure out the non end game yet. Like there's no hand holding for the most part
11477960	11483260	except for at the very beginning. And so like I'm just kind of pretending I know what I'm
11483260	11490180	doing and it's not working out so well in some situations like some quests I kind of
11490180	11496780	suck at but oh well I haven't seen but like maybe two level 50 characters and their armors
11496780	11502460	ugly so I don't even care about endgame yet. I just want story. Something just occurred
11502460	11509260	to me. What. We're sitting at a table eating. I know right. I know. Who does that anymore.
11509260	11515360	So Shane have you had any problems with like leveling up crap like keeping your crafting
11515360	11519180	up to level with what level you are and using the auction house because Rob I haven't played
11519180	11523740	myself but Rob was saying that he has trouble with how auction house works. The auction
11523740	11528000	house is pretty terrible auction house works like Final Fantasy 11 auction house in some
11528000	11533280	ways not only it's like a hybrid between 11 and wow it's weird. I don't really like it
11533280	11539300	but the crafting funny enough I'm actually doing right now while I'm on this Skype stuff
11539300	11547260	because I was not paying attention to it because part of the crafting aspect is that your companions
11547260	11552920	do it and not you. So I have I now have two companions so I can kind of do two things
11552920	11559640	at once but my companion that's like you know I can run around the world with and do stuff
11559640	11564300	with and fight is my tank and I'm a healer so I kind of need him to not craft because
11564300	11571620	he goes away when he crafts. So I'm just I'm leveling up the little thing that makes lightsaber
11571620	11578820	crystals right now because it's really really far behind. I like it. I don't have characters
11578820	11585260	later and do flash points. What was that? Sorry I'm eating a potato. Are we gonna get
11585260	11591140	on later and do flash points? Yeah. Or just regular quests because we can only do one
11591140	11597020	flash point until like 16 or 14 I forget. I thought you loved the flash points so much
11597020	11600620	in Star Wars though. Why do you love flash points so much that's a good question to ask.
11600620	11607220	Let me let me let me clarify that now because I've run a total of three. I like the starter
11607220	11615060	flash points for both sides now. It's neat because you can completely change the outcome
11615060	11620260	of that flash point story based on dialogue options. So all my characters for the most
11620260	11627180	part are light side even though they might be Imperial or Republic. So like I save the
11627180	11631660	captain from being killed. I save this general from being killed. I take this chick with
11631660	11639060	me that the commander wants killed. So if my choice gets picked out of the random roles
11639060	11644380	it affects the rest of the story for everybody for that specific flash point. So that's really
11644380	11650740	neat to me and they don't feel that long even though I think they're like an hour long each.
11650740	11660380	But I did just yesterday run a second flash point on my one of my characters I don't remember
11660380	11667460	who and it was very dull because it was all brown. It was like playing Gears of War or
11667460	11673380	any other FPS that's come out in the last couple years. Why do you say that just because
11673380	11680140	it graphically didn't look good? It's because there was just it was all the same color palette
11680140	11684620	and it was boring and I didn't even see all the story. See you only like pretty things.
11684620	11690060	I what? You only like pretty things. Yeah. Oh okay as long as we're clear. Normal person
11690060	11695460	would want something ugly. I don't know. That's why there's so many orphans. I ask myself
11695460	11706860	a lot. Wow. I was gonna say I ask myself that a lot when I cry to myself to sleep at night.
11706860	11712260	All right. Anyhow I should probably let you go soon so we can get other calls hopefully
11712260	11717380	but do you have any other closing thoughts for us tonight Shane? I was going to participate
11717380	11722020	in that top three games of the year thing on Facebook and then I got lazy and didn't
11722020	11727020	type anything out. But Portal 2 would have been my number one as well after thinking
11727020	11730660	about every single game that came out this year. Nothing else. I didn't sit through any
11730660	11735220	other game from start to finish this year except for Portal. I think what I should have
11735220	11740540	done is a top three most disappointing games of the year because there were a lot of hyped
11740540	11747740	games that did not meet expectations. My number one would piss people off. My top three would
11747740	11752420	probably make lots of people angry. Well you can make people angry because they can't send
11752420	11757460	hate mail to you. So what's your top three most disappointing? I wouldn't put them in
11757460	11763940	any sort of order because they were all very disappointing. I would say Dragon Age 2 because
11763940	11771780	it just wasn't that good. I would also say Uncharted 3 because 2 was so good and Uncharted
11771780	11778220	3 kind of dropped the ball. And then I would say Marvel vs Capcom 3. It's just not fun.
11778220	11783940	I even have Ultimate and I like playing Phoenix Wright but it's still not a fun game. Dark
11783940	11794620	Sakura? You said you like Strider, right? No, I like Phoenix Wright. Oh Phoenix Wright?
11794620	11803220	Well he can be wrong. You can choke on a potato too. I agree with Dragon Age 2. I believe
11803220	11809380	I've picked up every NPC that I can, I think. I just got off the mountain where Flemeth
11809380	11815100	is there and you do the thing where Flemeth comes back. I don't care about the side characters
11815100	11822140	like I did in Origins. Yeah, the story's just not as good. The combat's more fun. I own
11822140	11826420	it on PC and PS3. That's how much I cared about Dragon Age 1. I was like, oh I love
11826420	11831700	2, it's gonna be awesome. No. Yeah, I'm gonna beat it simply because I'm committed to the
11831700	11837100	world that they've built but the writing isn't as good. No. Alright. Shane, I gotta let you
11837100	11842340	go so we can get more calls. That's cool. Okay? I do. Alright, bye. Alright, we're gonna
11842340	11848460	go to some more calls. Hooray! Let's try this again. Hi, on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's
11848460	11853180	this? Hello, it's Derek H from Fardini Beach. Nice to hear from you again. I don't know
11853180	11858220	what happened before. It's a weird internet thing. I blame Skype. Well it's free so you
11858220	11862820	can't blame Skype but I still blame Skype. Alright, well you were talking about Steam
11862820	11867580	and you were about to say, you were talking about I only buy games on Steam when... They're
11867580	11873780	on sale and that is a huge mistake. I should only buy games on Steam. In fact, I'll say
11873780	11877620	this about everybody. Everybody should only buy games on Steam when they are full price
11877620	11883940	because then you know that you actually want that game because I have a, now after the
11883940	11891740	last week I have like 8 games I'm never gonna play again. I bought 2 games. I bought, I
11891740	11897660	looked and I said, oh wow, there's 2 flight sims for only $3 a piece and then I looked
11897660	11904300	and I have a flight stick that had fallen behind my desk like a year ago and I never
11904300	11908460	even bothered to reach it and so when I picked it up it had a layer of dust on it so I was
11908460	11913700	like, oh wait, I have a flight stick. I must like flight sims. So I bought those games,
11913700	11917660	played them for 20 minutes and realized I hate flight sims. Raise your hand if you've
11917660	11923740	been there. Earlier this year, I think it was the Thanksgiving sale, they had Dead Space
11923740	11928940	1 and 2 in a combo pack for like 4 or 5 bucks and I was like, alright, Dead Space, you know,
11928940	11932980	Resident Evil with aliens or ghosts in outer space, I'll buy that. I had already bought
11932980	11938140	it. Completely forgot that I had bought the rights to download that on my Steam. Same
11938140	11942660	with Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition. It's like, oh yeah, dirt cheap 3 bucks. I
11942660	11945820	get my credit card out. Oh yeah, you bought that 6 months ago but you forgot about it
11945820	11950060	instantly afterward. So I definitely have that problem.
11950060	11955620	I have Knights of the Old Republic on the Xbox version but you can play it on the 360.
11955620	11960780	I bought that like 2 years ago, actually like 4 years ago, a long time ago. I don't like
11960780	11967380	it. I'm one of the few people that cannot stand KOTOR and I saw it on Steam, it was
11967380	11974540	only $2.50. I actually, I struggled with myself not to buy it. Anyway, I own this game. I
11974540	11980460	don't like it but it's only $2.50. You posted on Facebook or Google or something about that
11980460	11985460	and I, cause I remember reading that. One of my friends worked on that game. Really?
11985460	11991400	You know what she called it? What? Scrotor. But hey, while she was working on it, we got
11991400	11994660	to go to the Skywalker Ranch. Oh, that's when you flung the meatball at George Lucas. No,
11994660	11998740	when I wanted to fling meatloaf at George Lucas. He walked by and I could have flung
11998740	12002300	meatloaf at him. I changed the story a little bit. I embellished. You know what, Derek,
12002300	12007500	I did something similar during this most recent Steam sale. I bought Quake Collection. I didn't
12007500	12013500	buy just one Quake game. I bought Quake 1, 2 and 3. Quake 2 isn't even that good. Quake
12013500	12018320	1 and 3 were good like 10 years ago but playing them now, like my video card doesn't know
12018320	12022980	how to handle Quake 3. Like I was having problems getting Quake 3 to even work. Why am I buying
12022980	12028780	Quake 3 when I can just go play Quake Live? I almost bought, when they had a thing where
12028780	12035540	you can buy all the Star Wars games or something for like $14, I was like, that's a great deal.
12035540	12041740	Even though I had no interest in buying these games when they came out or the years afterwards,
12041740	12047840	all of a sudden I think I kind of need these games. But that's how they get people. This
12047840	12051660	happens in our culture all the time is that people want to see that they're getting a
12051660	12055460	good deal. Like for example, look at all the hilarity that happened on Black Friday. I'm
12055460	12060180	sure everybody here saw the video, Derek I'm assuming you probably saw this too, of the
12060180	12064620	people at Walmart that were practically jumping on top of each other and clawing each other's
12064620	12071460	eye outs over $2 waffle irons. And it's like, who really needs a waffle iron? How many days
12071460	12077900	out of the year do you make waffles at home? Yourself? You know? How many days last year
12077900	12083620	did you make waffles? Well, I have a friend that makes waffles. But not you. You. You.
12083620	12089620	You make waffles weekly? I. Would you trust a $2 waffle iron to make waffles? No. Exactly.
12089620	12094620	Unless it was a recognized brand and a Rudolph. But why do people want to kill each other
12094620	12099460	over a $2 waffle iron? Because it's $2. If you waff that much then you don't want waffles
12099460	12108520	from a $2 waffle iron. We won a waffle iron at a white elephant exchange and Alan actually
12108520	12113740	tried to make waffles with it and he got so frustrated he was cussing at this cheap white
12113740	12121240	elephant waffle maker that makes little circus animal waffles. But anyway, sorry I'm totally
12121240	12125420	going on a tangent, but you know what I mean, in our culture people want to get things just
12125420	12129900	because it's a good deal. Okay, so Becky just messaged me and said I make waffles at least
12129900	12135420	twice a month. But Becky is also a great cook. Yeah, and she has a really good waffle iron.
12135420	12139620	I wouldn't be surprised at all. She probably has a lot of great cooking things that most
12139620	12145420	people don't have. So anyway, Alan you look like you're dying to say something over there.
12145420	12152780	There's, I'm too lazy to look it up, but there's actually a clinical term culturally for when
12152780	12157460	in times of financial hardship, like when the economy's in the shed or just when people
12157460	12161880	are broke, they'll go to the gas station when they fill up their car with a tank of gas
12161880	12165940	and they'll buy a candy bar and they're not even hungry. But it's just an 89 cent thing
12165940	12171020	that makes them feel good that they bought this little thing that just makes them feel
12171020	12178220	better because it's cheap. And steam is a great outlet for that impulse that we have
12178220	12184100	where I need to buy something, I'm tired of being broke or this is only a dollar, so who
12184100	12189360	fucking cares? Retail therapy. Really, I mean, in the end.
12189360	12195980	So you're saying I bought Wings of Prey because I'm clinically depressed is what you're saying?
12195980	12203980	I don't think it's quite that. That maybe, I don't think we could make that conclusion
12203980	12208500	here on the show. No, but people are just driven if something
12208500	12214340	is cheap. It just, sometimes it feels good to spend a little bit of money on even if
12214340	12219180	it's something that you know that you ultimately won't. I know I do it all the time, but yeah,
12219180	12222300	if you make something cheap enough, people will buy it whether they want it or not.
12222300	12228940	Maybe it would be a good policy moving forward for people before you buy a steam game, you
12228940	12234900	need to walk away for an hour and then say after an hour, okay, do I still really want
12234900	12237340	that game? And if the answer is yes, then you buy it.
12237340	12241820	You can't do it because they have that countdown on the screen.
12241820	12246300	What if I only have 57 minutes? Why do you think I just bought Bastion at
12246300	12249420	the start of the show? And I even told you, I said, wait till you
12249420	12259500	get home, click done. All right, Derek, good luck with your steam.
12259500	12265100	I don't want to say addiction, but your steam issues will say, and hey, at least I hope
12265100	12268980	you're getting to play some great games out of it, even if just for 20 minutes.
12268980	12274660	I'm going to go play VVV after the show. Hey, VVVV is awesome. Derek, quickly too,
12274660	12279500	since I was trying to pimp the big battle earlier, I want our listeners to understand
12279500	12285740	why should they sign up for the big battle? Oh, the big battle is a multi community gaming
12285740	12291820	tournament. You should do it because gaming is about having fun and you have more fun,
12291820	12296420	I believe, when you're competing and even more fun when you're competing for something
12296420	12300900	you enjoy. So basically you get to represent your favorite
12300900	12308180	like podcasts or whatever and say, hey, we're the best Mortal Kombat players. And it's not
12308180	12311700	even we're the best. It's like, you know, you know, it's not really, you're the best,
12311700	12315740	but it's something you can hold up over somebody else's head. It's kind of nice. It's always
12315740	12319500	fun when you can, when you can compete against all your friends and also you get to meet
12319500	12322820	new people, you get to play against people. You probably wouldn't have, you've been playing,
12322820	12326020	you've been playing games against the same 20 people for the last four years. Now you
12326020	12329140	get to play against some other people who share the same interests as you. It's a good
12329140	12332420	thing. I think it's great. And, um, you know, I signed
12332420	12335420	up to play and I'm not signing up because I, I'm not going to win. Like, who are we
12335420	12339420	kidding here? I'll probably get knocked out the first round, but you know, I may not be
12339420	12346780	the best, but I can be the loudest. I think for the, for the Mortal Kombat ones,
12346780	12351980	the ringers are the guys from spooky hour horror hour who, who love not only horror
12351980	12356420	games, but like everything about horror. So they live and breathe Mortal Kombat. So I
12356420	12360420	think they're probably going to be the, the winners there. But you know what? It's good
12360420	12365340	to take the, like throw a knife in Tedikins throat every couple of days. That'd be fun.
12365340	12370180	That'd be fun. All right. Well, Derek, I gotta let you go. So we wrap up the show, but thank
12370180	12373980	you so much for the call. Thank you for doing a show so late tonight. All right. No problem.
12373980	12378300	Take care. Bye bye. I didn't realize that God, we were on so damn late. It's like nine
12378300	12383500	40 almost. We're usually done at no pink Berry. I know. Right. All right. So I think we might
12383500	12386780	need to shut down the Skype line and wrap the show up. I don't know why we're going
12386780	12390660	long tonight. I guess we just had a lot to say after a week off. I don't know what else
12390660	12397500	to tell you. All right. Um, we finished tweets last minute stories. Usually I turn to Loki
12397500	12401980	for that. He's not here. I, I anticipate Alan probably didn't dig anything up. I have one.
12401980	12406940	Okay. There's been a clarification about the final fantasy 10 HD remake that Squeenix announced
12406940	12412340	in September. Yeah. Um, I guess one of the developers or producers was asked for like
12412340	12418620	a timeline and he's like, it's just to make this clear, the final fantasy X remake isn't
12418620	12426140	just a texture cleanup and a up and a resolution upscaling. It is a remake. So wow. Redrawing
12426140	12432700	of 10. Oh, so redrawing of assets. We just cleaning up the script, new voiceover work.
12432700	12437980	It is the real deal. So what everybody wanted from final fantasy seven, 10 is getting 10
12437980	12444420	is getting. Yes. Did you just do seven? Well, how about do six? So people thought, how about,
12444420	12448620	how about let's really remake a game. Let's, let's take one like six or four. Well, four,
12448620	12452860	I guess got the DS from me or may have a remake, but six, six is begging for a really, really
12452860	12459020	awesome remake. So interesting. That just came out. Yeah. Stories dated today. Wow.
12459020	12462580	Neat. Um, I guess the only other thing I could add is that there might be some of you wondering
12462580	12466140	why did we not talk about a certain scandal that was going on around the internet this
12466140	12473100	week, um, with this whole marketing company and, and the emails exchange and their device
12473100	12477780	and all that. There's two reasons. One, I think a lot of that stuff got really out of
12477780	12485460	control. Um, like, was it a slow news week or what? Um, and, uh, you know, I think a
12485460	12491060	lot of it's been discussed a lot and I don't know what else there is to add to that too.
12491060	12495620	I think Loki really wants to talk about it because he's actually used that controller
12495620	12499860	that's at the core of it. I think, although it's important to distinguish between the
12499860	12505740	individual that, you know, doesn't know how to deal with customers whatsoever and the
12505740	12510840	device itself, Loki has used the device itself and really wanted to comment on it. So I,
12510840	12515180	I'm kind of pushing that back to next week so we can discuss that a little more. So just
12515180	12518420	so you know, I just wanted to say yes, I'm aware that that happened in the gaming world
12518420	12524420	this week, but at the same time, I don't know, I might get shit for this, but whatever. I,
12524420	12529460	I kind of, it's not really gaming news. It's gaming community news and game community events
12529460	12535300	and I get why people are like following it. But I mean, it's just, it's just like horrible
12535300	12541020	train wreck, Ricky Lake holding her hand against the face with the jaw dropped, all that stuff.
12541020	12547620	So I can't believe you just made a Ricky Lake reference. Go Ricky, go Ricky. All right.
12547620	12551980	I will say though, um, this is Derek had just called in dead pixel live, actually got the
12551980	12558060	guy on the show and from what I understand, he apologized. So at that token, you know,
12558060	12562800	what else is there to say if he's apologized? But you know, I also kind of think I feel
12562800	12567700	bad cause I have no idea what this is about. I'll find out next week or go listen to dead
12567700	12572860	pixel live show from Thursday. It's, it's, it's interesting. The whole, the whole debacle
12572860	12578100	is interesting, but at the same time I think had this happened in November when Skyrim
12578100	12582340	and all these things were coming out, it wouldn't have been as big of a, big of a thing. So
12582340	12585620	they did a good job covering it in a more timely manner since, you know, they were able
12585620	12590220	to get the guy on like the day after it happened. So I think, uh, I don't know what we could
12590220	12594780	contribute to that conversation. It's been five days. That's an eternity in internet
12594780	12603940	time. All right. Um, let's see. I think we're ready to wrap it up so we can't really wrap
12603940	12608060	it up and put a bow on it and call it done until everybody has given their final thoughts.
12608060	12611460	So, um, Alan, I'll start with you. Thank you very much as always for filling in for egg
12611460	12615940	host who is not here. Um, appreciate it. And um, you know, now that the show is in your
12615940	12620100	house, maybe you'll stop by once in a while and say hello or when Loki's here, I'll just
12620100	12624920	play, you know, on the TV the whole time and ignore the show entirely. When we get the
12624920	12628500	video going, we can have you playing a game and you know, kind of talk about that and
12628500	12637060	we'll see. So, um, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight? Uh, no. Okay. Nothing
12637060	12642780	to plug. Nothing. All right. Fair enough. Uh, my final thought tonight is I haven't
12642780	12647380	had Hanson soda in a while, but now that I'm having this delicious black cherry soda, I've
12647380	12651900	kind of missed it. Dark soccer. Your final thought tonight? I love reading the stories
12651900	12661300	on unicorn booty.com. Nice. Oh, I have another final thought. Last night, New Year's Eve,
12661300	12665540	we watched a lot of adventure time. Is that what it's called? Adventure time? Cause that
12665540	12669260	show is adventure time with Finn and Jake. That show is pretty funny. I will say that
12669260	12673420	it's a good show. All right, that's it. We're done. We'll be back next week. Loki will be
12673420	12678260	back finally next week and we'll get his top three and a plenty more gaming news. You know,
12678260	12682220	we're into a new year. Uh, the news is going to start to come out as we get into the first
12682220	12688300	quarter releases and E3 in the summer all towards another clusterfucker releases in
12688300	12692340	October, November of 2012 right before the world ends. Have a wonderful week, everybody.
12692340	12696620	We'll see you next time here on orange lounge radio. Good night. You've been listening to
