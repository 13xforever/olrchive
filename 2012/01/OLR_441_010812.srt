1
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:15,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, January 8th, 2012.

2
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:19,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Could the next Xbox also be a digital video recorder?

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:25,078
[SPEAKER_04]: One retailer suggests a release date for Diablo 3, and rumors of new consoles at E3 2012 are already starting.

4
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,532
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers I really like salads

5
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:58,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Salads are delicious.

6
00:00:58,245 --> 00:00:59,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I just tossed mine.

7
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Into my mouth.

8
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:06,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh dear, that's not better, actually.

9
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,088
[SPEAKER_16]: You made it worse.

10
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:14,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Also joining us tonight, say hello, welcome back and welcome to Studio 6, Tech Master Loki.

11
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:14,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

12
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:15,349
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing?

13
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:17,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Really wish I could have been here last week.

14
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:18,990
[SPEAKER_16]: It's alright, you had family stuff going on though, right?

15
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I had to go eat at dinner at some...

16
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, I had to go get free dinner.

17
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:24,592
[SPEAKER_16]: It sucks.

18
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:25,392
[SPEAKER_16]: My life sucks.

19
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:29,434
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be if you are listening live.

20
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:35,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, as I mentioned before, we are live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Blockwell show.

21
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:40,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight, episode number 441, January the 8th, 2012.

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,721
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Loki, of course, you were out last week.

23
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:45,302
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the first time you've ever been to my place, I was realizing.

24
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:45,602
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

25
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you needed directions on how to get here.

26
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:47,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

27
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:48,644
[SPEAKER_16]: So, welcome.

28
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:48,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome.

29
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:50,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Josh got a lot of gifts and...

30
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:20,360
[SPEAKER_14]: and in times that he's not awake, I'm playing Skyrim.

31
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

32
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:28,167
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and somebody just joined the chat named, I love OLR.

33
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:29,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we love you.

34
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:40,759
[SPEAKER_16]: I love OLR and chat says, SWOTOR, or as I've been calling it on the other show, Horde House, SWETOR, SWETOR leveling, which is of course the Old Republic Star Wars, plus OLR in the background equals best Sunday night ever.

35
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,561
[SPEAKER_16]: I gotta admit, that's how I like to listen to live shows.

36
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:55,500
[SPEAKER_16]: I've tuned into some of the other all game shows a few times like Dead Pixel Live, Video Game Outsiders and I'll play WoW because I've only been playing Sweat Tour for about three weeks but I'll play WoW and do PvP and listen to Video Game Outsiders or whatever it's a good time

37
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Night of the Old Republic

38
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:20,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

39
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought one of them did internet radio.

40
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:37,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you can do that with diversity.

41
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:41,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I know I just use it for video, so I don't really, I've never messed with the music part of it.

42
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:50,604
[SPEAKER_16]: I know this would never, ever happen, but wouldn't it be nice if allgames.com could get one of those little channel things that you could install and have?

43
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,066
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, iHeartRadio, the clear channel thing has one.

44
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:59,870
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they have millions and billions of dollars, but all games totally has a 20 somewhere, maybe in the couch.

45
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, all games should be able to get that, right?

46
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:10,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyhow, let's see.

47
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:11,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, we've got to do some catching up here.

48
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:19,428
[SPEAKER_16]: You were out last week, and last week was the big show where we were talking about our top games of 2011 because we never really had a proper year-end show because of the way the holidays fell this year.

49
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,090
[SPEAKER_16]: And we all were speculating, what is Loki's top three games of 2011?

50
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on, it's going to be super easy.

51
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,571
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura and I guessed.

52
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:29,772
[SPEAKER_16]: We already have a list in our mind.

53
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:30,552
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I remember.

54
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,713
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember three and one.

55
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

56
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:32,613
[SPEAKER_16]: I think...

57
00:04:33,365 --> 00:04:33,886
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember.

58
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe one of the listeners will remind us in the chatroom what we had picked.

59
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:39,411
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to say, because I don't want to influence, so we'll wait.

60
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,113
[SPEAKER_16]: But Loki, let's hear your top three games.

61
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,035
[SPEAKER_16]: So number three, what did you think was the third best game of 2011?

62
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:56,107
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't know, because I didn't play a lot of games in 2011, sadly, because I just... I was really playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto the whole... Well, for the most part, up until recently...

63
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:15,775
[SPEAKER_16]: but that didn't come out in 2011 so that doesn't count we did allow, the criteria was your top game of the year and that might not actually be a game that came out this year because so many good games come out at the end of 2010 or in Alan's case, he put Dragon Age Origins as his number two game of the year because he just started playing it this year

64
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:17,255
[SPEAKER_16]: And we said, okay, you're allowed.

65
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Every gamer gets their voice, even if it's a tardy voice.

66
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:20,637
[SPEAKER_14]: That's tough.

67
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:24,318
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say, I mean, Grand Theft Auto was pretty awesome.

68
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:31,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I mean, it was nice to be able to play the mods again briefly until they patched it again.

69
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say probably my number three would be...

70
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare, I guess.

71
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:40,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we called it.

72
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:41,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Did we call it?

73
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:42,443
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we did, yeah.

74
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:43,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Modern Warfare.

75
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:56,928
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just fun now, and especially because, you know, the whole reason we switched to that game is because my coworkers were very pissed, or tired of me beating them in Grand Theft Auto, and they're just like...

76
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,261
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just like, oh, we gotta switch it up, we gotta play a game.

77
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:07,646
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, my boss, oh, I've played Call of Duty, you know, so I think I should be a little bit better than Loki is at that.

78
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:12,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, what they found out, and see, I didn't play a lot of Call of Duty at all.

79
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:21,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I literally, before we started playing it, I'd played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1 once.

80
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Once split screen, and that was it.

81
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And I didn't really care for it the first time we played it.

82
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:38,885
[SPEAKER_14]: But I ended up being really good at it apparently and a lot better than them and they are pissed because it didn't help.

83
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:48,110
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's actually been a lot worse now because I'm so stealthy in that game that I'll just sneak up behind them and do something funny and they'll be like, hey, hey.

84
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:50,040
[SPEAKER_14]: and then kill them.

85
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so you like this game because you can own the shit out of everybody.

86
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:53,501
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty fun.

87
00:06:53,561 --> 00:07:00,325
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually, Call of Duty, at least the Modern Warfare games and stuff, I mean, they really cater that stuff, especially the multiplayer portion.

88
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:08,509
[SPEAKER_14]: They really have it down pat and it's smooth, it works well and it's just very fun and streamlined.

89
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:09,269
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good.

90
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,430
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a series of games.

91
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,351
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not really into the war games.

92
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,013
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm terrible at first person shooters unless it's called Quake.

93
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:16,333
[SPEAKER_16]: You know,

94
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:17,794
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what, though?

95
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:23,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And I agree, playing online, like free-for-all deathmatch, not free fun.

96
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:26,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Playing team deathmatch online, that's a lot of fun.

97
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, yeah, I watched, I actually watched over the holiday.

98
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,983
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't talk about this last week, but I actually watched over the holiday.

99
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:37,046
[SPEAKER_16]: We were with some of Alan's family, and some of his brothers were playing Modern Warfare 3.

100
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:39,928
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was kind of watching, and I'm like, wow, it looks really good.

101
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:44,951
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were doing this interesting playback thing where he was showing us a video where his whole team...

102
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:45,952
[SPEAKER_16]: and DarkSakura.com.

103
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:11,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't really speak for 2 and 3 because I haven't played 2 and 3, so I don't know how much they've changed.

104
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:19,617
[SPEAKER_14]: But I can only imagine it's about as much as they've changed from Call of Duty 2 to 3, which wasn't a whole lot.

105
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:22,900
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just pretty much they have the game and that's it.

106
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a lot of it's catered towards multiplayer nowadays, but you know what?

107
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:28,345
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty fun.

108
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:29,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I like...

109
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:34,591
[SPEAKER_14]: What they were talking about that they were doing with the elite services and stuff, I can see where people would like that.

110
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:42,299
[SPEAKER_14]: But my whole thing before was just getting into online and actually playing free-for-all deathmatches and stuff, it just doesn't seem very fun.

111
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,022
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've actually played it, and I don't know, there's still a lot of people cheating online.

112
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:49,646
[SPEAKER_14]: You run into a lot of people running infection mods and stuff like that.

113
00:08:50,226 --> 00:09:17,386
[SPEAKER_14]: but Team Deathmatch actually doesn't seem to be plagued with that crap as much so it seems a lot more fun that way and I actually do pretty well considering I have rank 5 that's pretty low when you consider there's 11 Prestiges or 10 Prestiges and you can level up again on 10th Prestige and 55 levels per and people actually do level up I'm not sure if everyone does it legitimately but yeah so it's fun so Call of Duty

114
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's move on to your number two choice.

115
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:20,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Number two, best game of 2011.

116
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:27,237
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is tough because this game, you know, a couple weeks ago might have been number one.

117
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:34,505
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not because it's kind of like an actual person, sort of.

118
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:35,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Elder Scrolls Skyrim.

119
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Two for two, DarkSakura!

120
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:46,579
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason why Elder Scrolls Skyrim is number two and not number one is because the longer you play it, the worse it gets.

121
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,584
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not necessarily that the game is getting worse, it's just it's getting buggier.

122
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:52,806
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just it took an arrow to the knee.

123
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:54,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

124
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:09,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any sword to the chest.

125
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that makes the arrow to the knee guy sound like a pussy.

126
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Sword to the chest?

127
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:14,805
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't come back from that.

128
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:16,466
[SPEAKER_14]: He did, apparently.

129
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:21,809
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, it's gotten progressively buggering.

130
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:23,910
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I was complaining about it the other day on Facebook.

131
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,034
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a quest I can't finish now because the NPC for the quest is spawned under the map.

132
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,716
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can't get to them.

133
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:35,260
[SPEAKER_14]: It's literally a spot that is inaccessible.

134
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Alan got a pretty amazing bug this week.

135
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,146
[SPEAKER_16]: I should have him come on and explain it.

136
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,167
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to butcher this.

137
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:42,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully he hears.

138
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:42,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, here he comes.

139
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:42,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

140
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Alan hears me struggling.

141
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Alan, describe the Skyrim bug you got this week.

142
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:55,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I go to Whiterun, which is the main city in the center, the first major city you go to, I'm not a criminal.

143
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:56,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a bounty.

144
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:58,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I could talk to guards.

145
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,659
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, oh, hey, sup, bro, like your orcish armor.

146
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:12,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I go into Dragon's Reach where the Jarl is, and right when I go up the stairs, the Jarl and his bodyguard are like, oh, shit, get him, and the whole room aggroes, and I'm like, I'm dead.

147
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:13,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't do anything.

148
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:20,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So I left, and I just did other shit for like eight hours, and I went back, and it's fine.

149
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:23,829
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fine now, so I can use the enchanting table in there.

150
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:24,830
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was like, that was weird.

151
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Magically fixed itself.

152
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

153
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Fantastic.

154
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:28,551
[SPEAKER_16]: I love this comment in our chat room.

155
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:33,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Zen Thrall says, the guy that invented that mem, the arrow to the knee thing, needs to take a sack to the chin.

156
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:37,150
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know.

157
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:37,550
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just...

158
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,823
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting incredibly buggy and to the point where it's actually breaking the game.

159
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,625
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I mean, it's still fun.

160
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:07,306
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still playing.

161
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:15,531
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to kind of force myself not to play this week so I can get some other stuff done because I have over 85 hours in the game now.

162
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:25,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I have exploited pretty much every glitch possible in the game to level myself up to the point where I can't die anymore and I kill everything in one hit.

163
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:26,008
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's still fun.

164
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,154
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can sneak up right to somebody in plain daylight and be standing right in front of them and they can't see me which is kind of fun.

165
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:38,636
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that I can't finish that quest, that sucks.

166
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:44,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that sometimes parts of the land don't spawn and I fall through them.

167
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:55,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sometimes when you kill a dragon or whatever, it'll do one more lap around the sky and then crash epically.

168
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,721
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like, really?

169
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:58,141
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to do that?

170
00:12:58,181 --> 00:12:59,982
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't just die and fall to the ground?

171
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:05,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so despite all the crappy bugs, it's still your number two game of the year because... I played it a lot.

172
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:06,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

173
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:07,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm still playing it.

174
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, your number one game of 20... I mean, come on.

175
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, you gotta ask.

176
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:14,716
[SPEAKER_16]: What is your number one game of 2011?

177
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:16,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's say you threw the third.

178
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, three for three, right there.

179
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:23,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, didn't we go back and say, though, that Earth Defense Force was gonna end up number three?

180
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:24,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but see...

181
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:25,145
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we did.

182
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,966
[SPEAKER_07]: But then we allowed the old game rule.

183
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:27,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, alright.

184
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:34,808
[SPEAKER_14]: See, if it wasn't the old game rule, I probably would have been number three, only by default because Dead Rising 2 really sucked.

185
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:40,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And Earth Defense Force, it was pretty fun for a while, but man, it's pretty boring now.

186
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,131
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just they promised, oh, we're going to do all this DLC, it's going to be so fucking awesome.

187
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:47,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And nothing.

188
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:49,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Why Saints Row the Third?

189
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:51,614
[SPEAKER_14]: It's such an over-the-top game.

190
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,234
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just incredibly fun.

191
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,115
[SPEAKER_14]: It was everything I wanted that game to be and more.

192
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:12,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I want to finish it and get all 1,000 achievement points, but once again, there's a buggy portion of the game, and it happens to be kind of like the terrible part of it where you have to do these carjacking things and steal certain cars to...

193
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:14,382
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

194
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:45,803
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, you know, the DLC, I'm looking forward to it, although I'm not too optimistic on, you know, if it being really good.

195
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:53,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the new, like, from the achievements that were leaked out for the upcoming stuff, it just sounds like a bunch of extra excursions.

196
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of it, I mean, that would probably be pretty fun, but, you know...

197
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:03,034
[SPEAKER_14]: The activities, it's cool doing them sometimes, but I don't like being forced to doing them.

198
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:07,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I would rather have some actual missions to the game, but it just sounds like it's all activities.

199
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:10,858
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll try it.

200
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:15,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it'll be alright, but I'm not going to be one of those persons, and I haven't been.

201
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:19,503
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be one to buy every single piece of download content just because I like the game.

202
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:21,604
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not how I'm going to do it.

203
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:22,112
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

204
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:41,409
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

205
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:41,749
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

206
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Good guess, though.

207
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Star Wars, the old... No, I'm not playing that.

208
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:51,153
[SPEAKER_16]: I showed DarkSakura it for five minutes, and she was like, I don't get it.

209
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:52,653
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I got it.

210
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:53,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't really care.

211
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:55,454
[SPEAKER_14]: You never won a game.

212
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:57,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that I didn't care.

213
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:00,456
[SPEAKER_14]: It better not be something like The Sims Social or something.

214
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:01,417
[SPEAKER_14]: No, God, no.

215
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:02,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Think more.

216
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:03,637
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be easier to guess her.

217
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:04,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's a clue.

218
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:06,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's you.

219
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: How have you been?

220
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been really busy, but...

221
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Portal 2.

222
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:11,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

223
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,051
[SPEAKER_14]: and Saints Row the Third.

224
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:29,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So there we go.

225
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:32,094
[SPEAKER_16]: So after some cursing, we finally get Loki to agree.

226
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:32,675
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's official.

227
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:35,037
[SPEAKER_16]: The official OLR game of 2011 is Portal 2.

228
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, I played through that game, what, four times all the way through?

229
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:38,720
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.

230
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:42,503
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I completely forgot that that game came out this year.

231
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:52,391
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's really bad because I think a lot of the Game of the Year stuff, I mean, a lot of people talked about Portal 2, but I literally forgot that that came out this year.

232
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:59,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and you know, I actually have that, oh, it's you memorized very well because that's my message tone on my phone now.

233
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so I mean, yeah, Portal 2 for sure.

234
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:04,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I completely forgot.

235
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:05,772
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

236
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,533
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel so bad.

237
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad that you got it after I was quoting lines from it.

238
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Where the fuck is some DLC for that?

239
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I know they had some of the stuff on the PC.

240
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other guesses what might have been on our list?

241
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Quickly?

242
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:20,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

243
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:40,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fantasy 14 hell to the no hell to the no that would be in like three biggest disappointments of the year Super Mario 3D Land you got it it was my number three that was me Mario Kart 7 no Arkham City was my number two Arkham City was my number three yeah what was your number two I forgot um

244
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I actually have... Must not have been that good.

245
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:55,374
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I... I'll have to check on my hard drive because... Spazinator says the number one game was SingStar ABBA, L-O-J-K.

246
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:59,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what my... Wrong, it's not SingStar ABBA, it's ABBA You Can Dance.

247
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:01,579
[SPEAKER_07]: He was so hilarious playing that.

248
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,580
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but they also have SingStar ABBA on the PS3.

249
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,041
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that.

250
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:04,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember?

251
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that Tiara was in town when you got that.

252
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And we came and played it at the old house.

253
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,624
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know what my honorable mention was.

254
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:15,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Fractal.

255
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:17,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that game is cool.

256
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:20,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Fractal is a really neat puzzler.

257
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:21,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

258
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:22,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Marvel vs. Capcom.

259
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:23,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Marvel vs. Capcom.

260
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

261
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:26,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Nah, it just hit me all of a sudden.

262
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,590
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's... I'm like, LOL, I don't know.

263
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Quickly, our intro's running a little long.

264
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:36,612
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to just quickly say something about this because, Loki, you tweeted it to me.

265
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:40,333
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had listeners tweet me more stories about this whole Xbox hacking stuff.

266
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,854
[SPEAKER_16]: God, we've been talking to her blue in the face about it since August.

267
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:51,016
[SPEAKER_16]: If you don't know by now, I was hacked back in August and people were saying, oh, you let your password get out.

268
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:51,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you got phished.

269
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:52,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Microsoft's saying, oh, you got phished.

270
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:55,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, no, I'm a little smarter than that in the websites I visit.

271
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,178
[SPEAKER_16]: But no, apparently it was my own damn fault.

272
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:02,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, now that more and more people are getting hacked and more and more people are having problems with Microsoft, finally it's getting out there.

273
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:07,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Some gal set up a Tumblr where she was sharing her experiences, and for some reason it caught wildfire.

274
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:16,053
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think a lot of it is because she had the screencaps with Xbox support, she was screencapping the emails, and it gave a lot of the gaming press, I guess, for whatever reason, stuff to chop off.

275
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,234
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really, really bored.

276
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:23,079
[SPEAKER_16]: But what really was taking me off this week, and you linked me an article from IGN that literally said nothing.

277
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:24,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Literally said nothing.

278
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:32,941
[SPEAKER_16]: He said, yeah, Xbox is claiming that they're getting hacked, but Microsoft says they have no comment on the situation.

279
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:45,704
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, and apparently this guy on this website was the first to break the news a couple weeks ago, and it's like, that's kind of insulting when we were here in August talking about it.

280
00:19:45,924 --> 00:19:50,765
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying we should, that's not what I'm saying, because there were probably way other people before me.

281
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:52,505
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, I know people who were hacked before me.

282
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:53,385
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that.

283
00:19:53,405 --> 00:20:05,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just... It's just irritating that it's not news until it happens to somebody who has... Listen, just because a dude works in an office for a company that makes a lot of money doesn't mean he's any better than any other blogger out there in the world.

284
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:12,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's a lot of really stupid-ass posts that are on a lot of major websites, IGN especially.

285
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,616
[SPEAKER_14]: That does have not a lot of research in there.

286
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:23,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I mean, I think they got the comment from, what is it, Stephen Toulouse or whatever his name is, some supporter.

287
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:24,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the hell he is.

288
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:25,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

289
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Something to Xbox, but customer service related.

290
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:29,689
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to touch on Blue and the Fate.

291
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:35,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Go listen to that last show from 2011, episode number four, what the hell, Night Are We On Tonight, 2012.

292
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,290
[SPEAKER_16]: 4.41.

293
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Go listen to 4.39.

294
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:44,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Would have been the last one from... We had Justin on, who was talking about how he got broken into twice.

295
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Go... I mean, that's really all you need to hear.

296
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:51,589
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't want to keep talking about this until I'm blue in the face, but seriously, if you have not changed your password at this point...

297
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:59,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Do not... Microsoft is swearing up and down that they're doing everything... They're being ignorant.

298
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:00,515
[SPEAKER_16]: That's really the only word.

299
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,237
[SPEAKER_16]: They are completely ignorant.

300
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:03,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Microsoft is ignorant.

301
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:04,978
[SPEAKER_16]: EA is ignorant.

302
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,001
[SPEAKER_16]: The higher-ups in those companies are ignorant to the situation that's going on right now.

303
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:11,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Your money is at risk if your credit card is on your account.

304
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I have been sitting here telling you this blue in the face since August.

305
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:15,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Change your effing password.

306
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:16,926
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not that hard to do.

307
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:20,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Use a unique password on Xbox that you don't use anywhere else.

308
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:20,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Put...

309
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:23,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Put XB at the end of it or something.

310
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:26,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Or put MS with a dollar sign or something.

311
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:30,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Just make something that differentiates it from other places.

312
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:33,638
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, neither of us have been hacked.

313
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:39,422
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing is, though, is once again, they're right and they're wrong at the same time.

314
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:41,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Dan always played with points cards.

315
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:45,726
[SPEAKER_16]: And also hundreds and thousands of people have been.

316
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,129
[SPEAKER_16]: And including people I know that haven't touched their Xboxes in forever.

317
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:49,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

318
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:52,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying it's safer to pay with points cards.

319
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:58,450
[SPEAKER_07]: The only card I have ever had on there was one that I knew was going to expire in a month that I wasn't going to renew.

320
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,971
[SPEAKER_16]: I would still change your password.

321
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,491
[SPEAKER_16]: You might have people in there downloading.

322
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:04,632
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've changed my account.

323
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:05,632
[SPEAKER_16]: They can transfer.

324
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:17,935
[SPEAKER_16]: They might not charge anything but what a lot of them have been doing have they been logging in and then downloading the licenses to their local Xboxes and basically siphoning all your games which can cause you headaches later on.

325
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:18,455
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just saying.

326
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I've checked all my licenses and they're still on mine.

327
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,328
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've also never had gold on my account either.

328
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:26,444
[SPEAKER_16]: That may make it less attractive, too.

329
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:54,317
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two things that are... I mean, yes, true.

330
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,900
[SPEAKER_14]: They are not... Live.com is not compromised.

331
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,262
[SPEAKER_14]: But people are not being phished.

332
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:07,208
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole thing was, is all this stuff is coming from the hacks that happened a while back, and I even think it was the anonymous stuff where they were...

333
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:19,692
[SPEAKER_14]: dumping a bunch of... And it might not even necessarily be them, but something similar to the fact where they dump the email passwords combos from random forums or even gaming websites or whatever.

334
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:21,392
[SPEAKER_14]: EA may have even been one of those.

335
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:25,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, but... I think EA is the weak link, and I've been saying this for forever.

336
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:29,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does every single hack seem to come back to one of the EA games?

337
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:34,736
[SPEAKER_16]: And I get FIFA 12's gold pack thing where they're taking the cards and trading with other accounts, that whole thing.

338
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:35,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I get that, but why...

339
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:47,372
[SPEAKER_16]: If all these accounts are being sold on a Polish website or all these accounts are being bought and sold on there, why are they not selling accounts with other games too?

340
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:49,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does it always come back to FIFA?

341
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:53,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Because FIFA is a popular game in other countries.

342
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:56,242
[SPEAKER_16]: There's other popular games in other countries.

343
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is it always freaking FIFA?

344
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:03,043
[SPEAKER_14]: But the DLC for FIFA is a lot more expensive than buying a map pack for Call of Duty or something.

345
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Where there's smoke, there's fire.

346
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:08,545
[SPEAKER_16]: And it seems like FIFA is the common thing between all this.

347
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:12,226
[SPEAKER_16]: There's something about that game or EA servers that are allowing this to happen.

348
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,407
[SPEAKER_14]: EA sells a lot of garbage DLC.

349
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:15,627
[SPEAKER_14]: People buy it.

350
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:17,148
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's worth more.

351
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,650
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's really, I think, what it's coming down to.

352
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,510
[SPEAKER_14]: But it doesn't matter.

353
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:27,136
[SPEAKER_14]: You should be using a unique password and email combination on Xbox.

354
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:30,918
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's pretty much what you have to do.

355
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I mean, let's assume that even...

356
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:36,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, they're claiming phishing.

357
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:39,905
[SPEAKER_14]: What evidence do they have that there's actual phishing going on?

358
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:41,066
[SPEAKER_14]: They have no evidence.

359
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:42,226
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just making assumptions.

360
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:46,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Because all they know is, well, our stuff's not compromised, so it's got to be phishing.

361
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:53,934
[SPEAKER_14]: But what they should do is, listen, hey, you know, these other games, and I think I've seen one of them say that.

362
00:24:54,755 --> 00:25:04,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone that was associated with Xbox said, hey, you know, there were these hacks that happened, and a lot of this email password combos got out in what they're doing.

363
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,942
[SPEAKER_14]: and in fact, Anonymous said to do this when they leaked this crap out.

364
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:22,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Try it in Facebook, try it in Yahoo, try it in Gmail, try it in Twitter to see if you can use these login credentials to get in access to other people's stuff because these people should be changing their accounts because these websites got hacked, whatever.

365
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:24,147
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what it is.

366
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:33,490
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you need to change that stuff because if you use the same email and password combination or even username and password for every single website that you visit,

367
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,582
[SPEAKER_14]: If someone gets one of those, they've got them all.

368
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:43,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so again, we've spent way too much time talking about this because we've talked about it forever in the past on the show.

369
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:51,506
[SPEAKER_16]: If you tweet me and say my Xbox got hacked, I'm going to tweet you back and say I'm really sorry to hear that, but I told you to change your password in August.

370
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:59,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, if you tweet me back and say I changed my password back in August, I really do want to hear those because then that would prove something fishy is going on.

371
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not talking phishing.

372
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:05,212
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you haven't changed your password by now,

373
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:06,533
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

374
00:26:24,454 --> 00:26:26,476
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, what have you been up to?

375
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:42,473
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

376
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:00,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I can, a lot of books that you get that are tie-ins to series are kind of like, oh, meh.

377
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,660
[SPEAKER_07]: These are actually really good books.

378
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,541
[SPEAKER_07]: The stories are really great.

379
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:04,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on the second book now.

380
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:06,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I finished the first one in three days.

381
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just reading it, you know, in between times.

382
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:10,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So, really good books.

383
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:14,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I also played some Fractal.

384
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And I installed Bastion.

385
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played it yet.

386
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:21,124
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really been fractal and well.

387
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:23,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And we picked up DJ Hero 2 today.

388
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:27,357
[SPEAKER_17]: The girl installed the game, but you couldn't find the time.

389
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:30,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We got DJ Hero 2 today.

390
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,541
[SPEAKER_07]: The bundle set for 20 bucks at Big Lots.

391
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:35,042
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what tomorrow is.

392
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:35,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Woohoo bargaining.

393
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

394
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:41,666
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've also been playing Scare Shermie.

395
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally figured out how to sneak up on Shermie.

396
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:48,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Vacuum something in front of her.

397
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:53,258
[SPEAKER_07]: She's too busy staring at it in absolute horror.

398
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:55,480
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually sneak up on her and she'll jump.

399
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:59,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I saw a tweet or a chat comment or something earlier that said, I miss Shermie.

400
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:01,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, since we've moved studios, there's no more Shermie.

401
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:05,981
[SPEAKER_16]: There are two cats here in this studio, but they're afraid of people.

402
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,001
[SPEAKER_16]: They like to run and hide.

403
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:09,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're currently probably under my bed.

404
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:11,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Maruko loves me.

405
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but they don't know Loki.

406
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:14,286
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they're probably like, who's that guy?

407
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:16,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Maruko was sitting next to me, cuddling.

408
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:18,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Aw, he just likes attention.

409
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:19,110
[SPEAKER_07]: While I was reading.

410
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,911
[SPEAKER_07]: He walks around with his tail in the air, showing off his butt.

411
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:23,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at my butt.

412
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:52,898
[SPEAKER_07]: and I was getting the occasional stink eye from Sanrio but yeah mostly and I was reading those books here by the way reading them here and looking at your video games seeing which ones I was going to run off with I was out of town by the way at Disneyland mostly it's just been that we've still been arranging a lot of stuff from the move so we haven't had a significant amount of time and also the issues with my hand are getting worse again so I can't really sit down and play for very long

413
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:54,453
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

414
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:56,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

415
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:02,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this week I didn't really play much because I play Call of Duty at work, which is fine.

416
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:19,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, my coworkers are trying multiple ways to get me to not be as good, including as of Friday they taped a piece of cardboard to my monitor with a few random holes poked in it and, of course, blocking about 90% of the monitor.

417
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I still managed to stealth kill a few people though with a knife doing that.

418
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:28,229
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I could not aim and shoot at anybody because there was nothing in the direct center.

419
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:32,131
[SPEAKER_14]: So it made it very difficult to try to actually shoot somebody.

420
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:37,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, let's see what else.

421
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:41,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and I played Skyrim earlier in the week.

422
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:46,737
[SPEAKER_14]: But I stopped playing it this week just so I could get some other stuff done.

423
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:47,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Because every time I'm like...

424
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,719
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

425
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:13,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the quests from the game.

426
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, obviously, they can't test.

427
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:41,915
[SPEAKER_14]: If you step on this rock over here, you get launched into space or something like that because there's a lot of landmass to go wander around and test every single random event that would happen.

428
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:44,638
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would think an actual quest in the game...

429
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,768
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be very obvious that it's not working correctly.

430
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,549
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't care.

431
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:52,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have to finish that quest.

432
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:55,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not a necessarily completionist in this case.

433
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:59,733
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just still annoying, though, that something like that would break.

434
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:06,156
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't mind if a character gets trapped in a wall or something like that.

435
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:08,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I did mind that a little bit, and I had to reload a few times, but...

436
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,262
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting to the point now where I'm actually starting to get the frame stutters and stuff like that.

437
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:20,083
[SPEAKER_14]: It's stopping and then going and stopping and going.

438
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:22,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to stop moving for a second for it to catch up.

439
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:24,305
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not good.

440
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:27,246
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the PS3 crap that's going on right now.

441
00:31:27,406 --> 00:31:29,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I might try to get back into some Skyrim this week.

442
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:29,887
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

443
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:34,868
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a little MMO'd out right now, but I'll get to my own week in a minute.

444
00:31:34,888 --> 00:31:35,888
[SPEAKER_07]: We still need to play Pally's.

445
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:36,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we do.

446
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:39,009
[SPEAKER_14]: That would make WoW more interesting.

447
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:44,391
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not really sure if we want to talk about it right now, but I've also... Like I told you that I've been...

448
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:50,433
[SPEAKER_14]: My co-workers have been finding ways to try to hinder my gameplay in Call of Duty.

449
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:56,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me set this up a little bit because this is one of the stories we didn't talk about a lot last week because it seemed like it was everywhere.

450
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,155
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not really a story.

451
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:02,737
[SPEAKER_16]: It was really something that caught fire in a non-news week.

452
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:08,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, yes, the guy was an idiot, but it was just that guy got taken to the cleaners.

453
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:09,379
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just like, really?

454
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,459
[SPEAKER_16]: This is how bored we are?

455
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:37,670
[SPEAKER_16]: but um it's obviously we're talking about the ocean marketing thing and and the whole controller that they were promoting was the Avenger now I think we can all separate the controller from the situation and this one guy with the ego however ironically enough Loki had procured a copy or an I've had one of these for months now and was ready to review it on the show when this all happened so Loki go ahead the Avenger controller now

456
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:43,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the Avenger controller, it's basically, I mean, there's a couple different spins I've heard on it.

457
00:32:43,673 --> 00:33:02,182
[SPEAKER_14]: One, yes, it's created by a guy, I think he was a teacher or something like that, and his reasoning behind it was, oh, well, I wanted to make something that made games a little bit more accessible for people with disabilities or something like that, because he knew somebody that had trouble with a range of motion or something like that, and

458
00:33:02,782 --> 00:33:07,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So they had issues reaching the buttons or something.

459
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:08,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the case may be.

460
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:17,993
[SPEAKER_14]: But that said, though, the way they're marketing it is not necessarily, you know, oh, this is for people that have disabilities.

461
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:20,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, and if you have disabilities, that would be good, too.

462
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:31,202
[SPEAKER_14]: But, no, it's supposed to be something that actually decreases the amount of latency between your reaction and hitting the buttons.

463
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:36,686
[SPEAKER_14]: And the way they do that is by putting these extra arms above the...

464
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,429
[SPEAKER_14]: X, Y, and B buttons.

465
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:49,274
[SPEAKER_14]: These arms reach out over behind the trigger and kind of on the middle of your finger for the B button as well.

466
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:50,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I doing this right?

467
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:51,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm holding this right now.

468
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:53,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you kind of lift up?

469
00:33:53,336 --> 00:33:55,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you're supposed to lift up and it's supposed to hit the button.

470
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:57,299
[SPEAKER_14]: A little interesting.

471
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,161
[SPEAKER_14]: You can adjust those arms too because that's adjusted for me right now, but...

472
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:03,042
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

473
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:33,427
[SPEAKER_14]: That's supposed to cut down the amount of time it takes you to press the trigger buttons.

474
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:38,750
[SPEAKER_14]: It's supposed to make you better in games because you're hitting buttons faster and your reaction time is faster.

475
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:50,213
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all good on paper, but it doesn't work that way, unfortunately, because you have to retrain yourself to play games, and it's actually very fucking awkward to play with that.

476
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:56,578
[SPEAKER_14]: It was harder to play Call of Duty, and I gave it... I think I gave it a fair amount of time.

477
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:58,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say a total of about...

478
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,881
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

479
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:19,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Call of Duty

480
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:39,631
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

481
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:21,856
[SPEAKER_07]: and you like you see how there's like a rubber bandy thing you can also kind of like tug on that and that triggers it too but this actually is much more comfortable to my finger because I don't have to have it up and put my hand in an awkward position because the whole problem I have with um with the triggers is that um I have to move my hand much higher up to reach them and

482
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:32,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I had something that would work for the top two triggers instead of the back one, like this long piece, it would be very comfortable for me.

483
00:36:32,162 --> 00:36:34,664
[SPEAKER_16]: So like a half Avenger would be really good for DarkSakura.

484
00:36:34,704 --> 00:36:34,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

485
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:43,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, unfortunately, the part that you can take off the Avenger are the actual trigger buttons, or the, I don't know what they call them, paddles or whatever the hell, on the back there.

486
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:48,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the things you can take off if you don't like pulling on the...

487
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Actual, like, skis or whatever the hell they call them.

488
00:36:51,095 --> 00:36:58,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say real quick, Derek H. in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, Loki should tape three of his fingers together to simulate how it is supposed to be used.

489
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:04,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, it's a waste of money, to be honest.

490
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I want one.

491
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:09,363
[SPEAKER_14]: My opinion is it's a waste of money.

492
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:11,425
[SPEAKER_16]: See, it's very interesting.

493
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:21,491
[SPEAKER_16]: For you, the normal controller doesn't bug you, but for her, she's like, okay, now I can see maybe something that might let me play games a little longer, so she's into it.

494
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:23,433
[SPEAKER_16]: You should just give her yours.

495
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:25,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing, though, Jamie.

496
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,516
[SPEAKER_14]: You're having trouble hitting some of the buttons.

497
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:29,737
[SPEAKER_07]: These would need to be adjusted.

498
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:33,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but the buttons that you have trouble hitting are the shoulder buttons, right?

499
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

500
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:42,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, they have controllers that have remappable buttons that would be on the bottom of the controller that you would hit with one of your middle fingers.

501
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:44,186
[SPEAKER_14]: You drop Siri.

502
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:45,227
[SPEAKER_14]: On the...

503
00:37:47,721 --> 00:38:05,335
[SPEAKER_14]: on this controller but like it's just the problem is okay the price point is 50 bucks first off for not a controller they call it a controller it's not a fucking controller it's a piece of shit that attaches to a controller if it were a controller I would be able to take this off and play with just this and it would work just fine $50 for that's a little steep

504
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:23,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, and really, I mean, I understand that there could be uses for it as far as, you know, people, like they said right here, the rocker, you know, this B rocker here, they said, players with larger or smaller hands may utilize the rocker for added comfort.

505
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

506
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:52,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Really what would make the controller in general better for me is just extend the top to where the two triggers are further back.

507
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:58,429
[SPEAKER_14]: They have also these sticker things that I pulled off of here already because I'm planning on reselling this because it's a piece of shit.

508
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,292
[SPEAKER_14]: They had one that plucked, and that's the other thing too.

509
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:06,235
[SPEAKER_14]: See, you'll notice that there's actual triggers for all the buttons except for the A button.

510
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:09,757
[SPEAKER_14]: You still have to move your thumb off of here to push jump.

511
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:14,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's recessed because now there's this hunk of garbage on top of the controller.

512
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,083
[SPEAKER_14]: So now it makes it really difficult to hit the A button.

513
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:20,686
[SPEAKER_14]: So their solution is there's a sticky pad that you can put on top of there.

514
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:21,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

515
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,210
[SPEAKER_14]: So not worth the price at all for you.

516
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,890
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not worth the price.

517
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,473
[SPEAKER_16]: But maybe an accessibility thing.

518
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:30,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe if you have issues, you might want to try one.

519
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:31,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I think it could be done better.

520
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:34,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if it's an accessibility thing, I think it could be done better.

521
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:36,943
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you're having trouble hitting...

522
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:47,526
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want something that's going to hit these face buttons or whatever, I'd recommend if you're playing Call of Duty, if you're going to... They had one either for Modern Warfare 2 or Black Ops.

523
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:58,969
[SPEAKER_14]: They had a controller with two... It was from Mad Catz with two buttons on the bottom that were mappable to either the left stick, right stick, or L3, R3, and then the four face buttons.

524
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:04,531
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can hit those buttons on the bottom using... I guess it would be... Let me see here.

525
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:09,352
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be probably with your middle finger to hit those buttons on the bottom.

526
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:13,233
[SPEAKER_14]: That's actually not too bad as far as comfort goes.

527
00:40:13,313 --> 00:40:14,674
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be my recommendation.

528
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:19,935
[SPEAKER_14]: For $50, you actually get a controller that you can use straight out of the box and go.

529
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:25,857
[SPEAKER_14]: This is $50 plus you have to have a $60 controller to plug it on top of.

530
00:40:25,877 --> 00:40:26,177
[SPEAKER_14]: It's $110.

531
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:27,197
[SPEAKER_14]: I love their website.

532
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:55,594
[SPEAKER_14]: and this is another reason for me to hate G4 but I love their website because they have a bunch of different reviews on it and one of them was from G4 where they're comparing this and a controller from Evil Controllers which is ironic because this controller I have in here is a modded controller from Evil Controllers um yes and they're fucking expensive so I don't recommend buying them because it's not you can get it way cheaper and stuff but they're still nice um

533
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:07,492
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like, their review, and this is Adam Sessler on fucking X-Play, their review was, well, we don't like the Evil Controllers because Rapid Fire Controllers are cheating.

534
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:08,072
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cheating.

535
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you guys like cheating, then meh.

536
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:13,234
[SPEAKER_14]: That was their negative review for Evil Controllers.

537
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:16,355
[SPEAKER_14]: But we like this Avenger one because it's not cheating.

538
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,376
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the reason they liked it.

539
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:21,758
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's your educated review for that.

540
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:27,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting side though, did you hear G4 has a new president now?

541
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:32,829
[SPEAKER_16]: And it has to do with that whole Comcast, you know, because G4 is a Comcast network and that whole Comcast NBC thing that's happening.

542
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,151
[SPEAKER_16]: So, interesting.

543
00:41:34,251 --> 00:41:37,455
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, yeah, I just want to say, you know, because, you know...

544
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:41,939
[SPEAKER_14]: They were trying to pull with a lot of the stuff.

545
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:48,884
[SPEAKER_14]: The adventure was meant for people with disabilities.

546
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:53,268
[SPEAKER_14]: They tried to swing that whole emotional, I've got to feel sorry for them.

547
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:59,933
[SPEAKER_14]: They donated a child's play because of this whole bad PR and the fact that they still haven't delivered these pieces of shit controllers.

548
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:02,294
[SPEAKER_14]: I got one of these months ago, so they were done.

549
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:04,215
[SPEAKER_14]: They just haven't manufactured them, whatever.

550
00:42:05,276 --> 00:42:07,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's fucking plastic, so I don't know why it's taking so long.

551
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:21,565
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the way that they were marketing it, except the problem is it's not Avenger, the controller to allow all gamers to play games, including those with disabilities.

552
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,747
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Avenger, the ultimate gaming advantage.

553
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,247
[SPEAKER_14]: And no, I'm sorry, it's not an advantage.

554
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:28,689
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually quite a disadvantage, and I seriously would...

555
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:29,609
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

556
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:48,976
[SPEAKER_16]: That's enough.

557
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:51,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Clearly we know how you feel about that, Loki.

558
00:42:51,077 --> 00:42:51,997
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's enough.

559
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,537
[SPEAKER_16]: I gave it a fair share.

560
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:59,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I played for that for five hours and trust me, I did not want to play for that long a time with that controller.

561
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:00,499
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just terrible.

562
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, my gaming week quickly.

563
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,180
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have a lot to really add because there hasn't really been any new games that have come out.

564
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:12,602
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's been basically more Sweat Tour, Star Wars The Old Republic, and Warcraft, of course, because that's every week.

565
00:43:13,082 --> 00:43:16,263
[SPEAKER_16]: And randomly got an urge to play Super Mario World.

566
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,664
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

567
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:37,455
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty cool.

568
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:40,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so I've been playing that, just old school a little bit.

569
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,320
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally tried PvP in Sweat Tour.

570
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:44,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was actually really fun.

571
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:45,903
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the commentators.

572
00:43:46,063 --> 00:43:47,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, that part was really funny.

573
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:53,670
[SPEAKER_16]: As you're playing, there's actually live commentators like, you know, Oh, they just killed a guy on the Frog Pants team.

574
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,490
[SPEAKER_16]: They took him down.

575
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:55,751
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just really funny.

576
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Is Greg Proops in there again?

577
00:43:57,853 --> 00:43:59,235
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not Greg Proops.

578
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:01,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Such a missed opportunity.

579
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:02,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, he's not doing anything.

580
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:03,757
[SPEAKER_14]: The frog knobs or something?

581
00:44:03,797 --> 00:44:05,277
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

582
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:06,098
[SPEAKER_14]: What's he doing now?

583
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:10,759
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like hosting some weird news on Yahoo or something like that.

584
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:11,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, come on.

585
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,700
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy's not doing anything right now.

586
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:12,900
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

587
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,761
[SPEAKER_16]: He's got his podcast.

588
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:14,241
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great.

589
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:15,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Smartest man in the world.

590
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:16,522
[SPEAKER_16]: I would endorse that podcast.

591
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:20,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say, I listened to it in Rob's car.

592
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:22,724
[SPEAKER_14]: He can squeeze out some more voice work for a game.

593
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:24,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

594
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:24,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

595
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:25,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Just throw some money his way.

596
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:26,226
[SPEAKER_14]: He'd do it.

597
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:28,748
[SPEAKER_16]: SuperStreetFighter4 Arcade Edition

598
00:44:49,725 --> 00:44:55,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Street Fighter 3, and Mortal Kombat, the new one, Mortal Kombat 9.

599
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,131
[SPEAKER_16]: They are doing competitions.

600
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:58,372
[SPEAKER_16]: These are all on Xbox 360.

601
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:00,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Fighting game competitions.

602
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:04,256
[SPEAKER_16]: And up until the show started, there was only two people signed up.

603
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:04,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Two!

604
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:05,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Representing OLR.

605
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:07,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Myself and Tiger Claw.

606
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:07,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Tiger Claw.

607
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:13,120
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I just reloaded the site and I did notice a couple more have signed up for Super Street Fighter 4.

608
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,461
[SPEAKER_16]: I see VidPower and SpongeTwang have signed up to represent OLR.

609
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:22,563
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm feeling a little better, but if you guys want to make me really happy, this is, and you can't procrastinate.

610
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,304
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, for podcasties, it's too late.

611
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:51,030
[SPEAKER_16]: you can't register for this anymore but those of you guys listening live this is literally your last chance because today is the last day and I posted the link there in our chat room you can go sign up on the forums to participate and represent OLR you don't have to be good at these games just represent OLR just you know do your best because I signed up for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 which is the only game I have on 360 out of these and I am prepared to get my ass handed to me although I will try I will put up a fight literally

613
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:24,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's see, moving on.

614
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:26,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess that's it.

615
00:46:26,178 --> 00:46:26,899
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get into some news.

616
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:33,585
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll just quickly say follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and we're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

617
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:37,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's get into tonight's news.

618
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:38,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

619
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:50,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about Atari and some of their, I guess, witch hunts over infringing iOS games.

620
00:46:50,797 --> 00:47:04,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently they're going after everybody that has games that look like theirs, and whether they're just a blatant ripoff of, say, Asteroids or Breakout or something like that, or if it just happens to be a tank game with vector tanks, you know.

621
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:06,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

622
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:41,168
[SPEAKER_14]: For companies like Atari, our intellectual property portfolio is our most valued asset.

623
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:56,011
[SPEAKER_14]: While we have a great respect for indie development community and greatly appreciate the enthusiasm that they have for our renowned properties, we need to vigorously protect our intellectual property and ensure that it's represented in highly innovative games.

624
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:02,493
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

625
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:24,367
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a slippery slope though, because I want to say, okay, yeah, I get it.

626
00:48:24,427 --> 00:48:31,089
[SPEAKER_16]: We see these knockoff games on the iOS devices and especially Android stuff all the time, but where do you draw the line?

627
00:48:31,129 --> 00:48:39,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if you think about it, couldn't any shoot-em-up game, any first-person shooter, couldn't anything come back to combat?

628
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:41,332
[SPEAKER_16]: If you really think about it.

629
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:47,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, like, see, I have a problem with the fact that, you know, okay, it's a vector game that has tanks in it.

630
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:52,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but even I think in the arcades they had more than just Battlezone.

631
00:48:52,939 --> 00:49:00,384
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember an awesome PC game, awesome, awesome PC game called Spectre that was like a vector tank game, but it was not...

632
00:49:01,545 --> 00:49:04,846
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it was not Battlezone.

633
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:09,027
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember the big thing about it is you could do modem play and all this stuff, which was huge when I was growing up.

634
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:15,669
[SPEAKER_14]: And the whole reason they're doing this, of course, is because they have their own games that they're releasing on the iOS marketplace.

635
00:49:16,029 --> 00:49:21,050
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what it really comes down to, I think, is that they just want to release it and actually get some money for it.

636
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, let's be serious here.

637
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:26,611
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like Arkanoid and stuff like that.

638
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:28,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, which Arkanoid isn't really theirs, actually.

639
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:30,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it Breakout?

640
00:49:30,272 --> 00:49:31,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Taito was Arkanoid.

641
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:31,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Taito.

642
00:49:32,213 --> 00:49:34,933
[SPEAKER_14]: But Breakout, I mean, that's pretty much like Arkanoid.

643
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:36,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, really big difference.

644
00:49:36,494 --> 00:49:39,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Arkanoid is just a souped-up version of Breakout, if you will.

645
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:42,875
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's got the falling, you know, things that you pick up that change the paddle.

646
00:49:43,015 --> 00:49:48,937
[SPEAKER_14]: But, like, you know, I would say that that's more of, like, a genre of games now, less of a, you know, because...

647
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:55,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it kind of goes back to saying, well, you know, there's fighting games and they're all clones of Street Fighter.

648
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:57,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's a genre now.

649
00:49:57,848 --> 00:50:06,560
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not necessarily... Yeah, a lot of stuff is inspired by or is a clone of something and they kind of throw their own unique spin on it and there's that.

650
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:28,441
[SPEAKER_14]: or there's the games that are on the ios a lot of games out there that there's guys trying to make a quick buck and they put something with the angry birds characters they literally rip the assets from the game and then they create something else or you know something that's like it's angry cats and there's dogs or something or you just you know to the point where that's a ripoff don't the masses kind of know how to tell a cheap ripoff though

651
00:50:28,601 --> 00:50:41,753
[SPEAKER_16]: well the masses do but see it reminds me of those CDs they sell at Target for like $5 that are like you know top 40 hits and all it is it's like really bad cover songs of the stuff that's on the radio right now

652
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:46,495
[SPEAKER_14]: But a lot of it, though, it's kind of like one of those things.

653
00:50:46,976 --> 00:50:50,197
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to try to protect their rights or they lose their rights.

654
00:50:51,077 --> 00:50:52,818
[SPEAKER_14]: So they kind of have to do this.

655
00:50:53,318 --> 00:51:03,262
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, I think the reason they're doing this is because they're putting games up on the iOS platform that... I mean, they recently released updated versions of Breakout and Asteroids.

656
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:06,603
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, maybe that's why they're doing it.

657
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:06,804
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

658
00:51:08,725 --> 00:51:11,908
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, okay, I can't fault them for trying to do that.

659
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:19,094
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's be honest, there's a lot of shit on the app store that's fucking just ripping off all sorts of shit.

660
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:24,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's a ton of rip-off games out there, and there's a ton of games inspired by stuff.

661
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I would say Vector Tanks is probably, it's a somewhat, you know...

662
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:31,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Original game.

663
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:42,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, it's inspired by the old vector graphics and maybe inspired by Battlezone, but it's not like they're not calling it Tank Zone and it has basically all the same gameplay as Battlezone.

664
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:43,902
[SPEAKER_14]: I just...

665
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:45,670
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

666
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,194
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that they should be going after the right people, but they're going after everybody instead.

667
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:56,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the same time, why aren't the people there making the Mario games and shit like that getting that stuff taken down?

668
00:51:56,363 --> 00:52:00,748
[SPEAKER_16]: To turn this to 180 a little bit, this is what really worries me about SOPA.

669
00:52:00,948 --> 00:52:03,669
[SPEAKER_16]: and that whole thing and why people are really scared.

670
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:10,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if you allow corporations to kind of draw the line, they're going to draw it too far in the sand one way.

671
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they're going to take out everything.

672
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:16,411
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be crazy if something like that actually passes, you know?

673
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:24,633
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, and all this stuff that we see is just evidence of that because Atari may overreach in trying to protect their stuff.

674
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:29,994
[SPEAKER_16]: And who's to say, you know, other companies... Do you trust a lot of these companies to draw the line?

675
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:31,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course not.

676
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:32,935
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's the funny thing too.

677
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:44,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Say for example I make a game or something that's pretty original and I release it out there and Atari goes and I consider ripping off some of my ideas or something like that.

678
00:52:45,419 --> 00:52:53,801
[SPEAKER_16]: This game is too much like Custer's Revenge that Loki made and so we have the rights to this game even though it was really a third party.

679
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:58,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's say for example here's an example that's not necessarily accurate but

680
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:20,744
[SPEAKER_14]: was it the ferret tossing game let's just say the ferret tossing game comes out and it's too much like Defender with the whole scrolling left and right and the people on the ground too much like Defender or okay maybe that's a bad example let's just say let's say say I release the game out there and all of a sudden you know Atari comes out or not even necessarily Atari just some company comes out and

681
00:53:21,725 --> 00:53:22,486
[SPEAKER_14]: A major company.

682
00:53:23,448 --> 00:53:25,411
[SPEAKER_14]: And puts out a game on iOS or something like that.

683
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:26,774
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very similar to my game.

684
00:53:27,254 --> 00:53:30,600
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as all the original aspects of that game, it's very similar to that.

685
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:31,782
[SPEAKER_14]: I myself...

686
00:53:32,765 --> 00:53:35,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to Apple and say, hey, I want you to take this down.

687
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:36,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they going to do it?

688
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:44,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not because this major company that has a lot more money invested into the App Store than I do, and they're just probably going to ignore what I say.

689
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:50,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet if Apple comes and says, hey, we don't like ferret tossing or whatever like that, even though it –

690
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:54,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Vaguely resembles something that they may have done.

691
00:53:54,206 --> 00:53:55,906
[SPEAKER_14]: They will take it down without a blink of an eye.

692
00:53:55,926 --> 00:53:57,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's going to know where to draw the line?

693
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:01,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you trust the government to draw the line?

694
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:05,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think senators and all them play video games?

695
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,111
[SPEAKER_16]: I think one senator came out and said, well, a lot of my staff does play Mortal Kombat.

696
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:14,172
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the most video game keen thing I've ever heard.

697
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:15,899
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

698
00:54:34,412 --> 00:54:49,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that not everybody plays games out there, but I would assume nowadays that the vast majority of the populace plays games in some form or another, not necessarily console games, but at least on the internet, the occasional phone game or something like that.

699
00:54:50,037 --> 00:55:01,280
[SPEAKER_14]: And if these people representing us don't have any fucking clue about what's going on out there, and they just don't care, they'd be like, well, I don't watch TV, so why should I protect the rights of the people that want to watch TV?

700
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:01,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

701
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:10,369
[SPEAKER_16]: that's just not good you need to get these people out anyhow, tangent, sorry about that but it's important it's kind of stuff that's going on right now

702
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:12,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

703
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:39,259
[SPEAKER_16]: According to Best Buy, and this is, again, to be fair, it's not the whole damn corporation.

704
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:49,367
[SPEAKER_16]: It's one store that apparently was in Minnesota where the Twitter user was that had a standee that said Diablo 3, midnight opening, available for purchase 12.01 a.m.

705
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,688
[SPEAKER_16]: on February 1st as the launch date.

706
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And February, by the way, was spelled wrong.

707
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:57,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, there's been this whole... Was it missing an R?

708
00:55:57,293 --> 00:55:58,273
[SPEAKER_16]: There's this whole back and forth.

709
00:55:58,594 --> 00:56:01,336
[SPEAKER_16]: F-E-B-U-R instead of R-U.

710
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:02,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Febr.

711
00:56:02,723 --> 00:56:05,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, which, granted, February's a tricky word.

712
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:11,248
[SPEAKER_16]: It's probably one of the more common misspelled words, but still, clearly not an official Blizzard product if that's the case.

713
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:13,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Now there was this whole back and forth that went on.

714
00:56:14,589 --> 00:56:29,237
[SPEAKER_16]: A UK retailer kind of clarified the date too and showed a February 3rd date, and then there was this whole other back and forth where the Best Buy was actually called by the gaming press and that the sign was actually taken down,

715
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:44,464
[SPEAKER_16]: and then Bashyok, one of the community managers over at Blizzard, actually said on Twitter, LOL, we can't stop shops from doing whatever they want to do, I'm paraphrasing here, but retailers will find out when the rest of you do, basically when it's in an official press release.

716
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:47,605
[SPEAKER_16]: But certainly there's a lot of back and forth going on about the release date.

717
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:49,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, you're on the inside a little bit.

718
00:56:50,046 --> 00:56:51,047
[SPEAKER_16]: You're shaking your head over there.

719
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's Micah Whipple.

720
00:56:53,888 --> 00:56:54,668
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Bashyok.

721
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:58,170
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they have not announced an official date yet.

722
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,471
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll know when they do.

723
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:40,319
[SPEAKER_16]: for Warcraft, and the fact that you're going to have probably a million people getting it for free because they're committed to WoW, and they're going to drop it at a time where it's going to distract them from WoW because nothing's going on in WoW.

724
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,361
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think end of March is reasonable.

725
00:57:42,561 --> 00:57:51,248
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're also going to be starting their marketing campaign, which will be massive, and so one month lead time is not enough.

726
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

727
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:36,584
[SPEAKER_16]: it's fucking done and the problem is it has to do with the whole it's the auction house thing that's getting tied up in Korea as part of it and now they're using this as an excuse to put more into the game which is yet to be revealed but I don't think it's I think a lot of this is to make sure that legally that auction house thing gets clearance in all the countries I honestly believe that I think this game should have been out last year and I think they were going to announce it at BlizzCon for a December release and change their tune when Korea happened so

728
00:58:37,364 --> 00:58:37,684
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

729
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:43,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Virtual M in our chatroom says the website does list it as February 1st if you go to BestBuy.com.

730
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:44,448
[SPEAKER_16]: But placeholder dates are super common.

731
00:58:44,468 --> 00:58:45,248
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a placeholder date.

732
00:58:46,029 --> 00:58:51,392
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably, if I remember correctly, the last update we got from them was Q1 2012.

733
00:58:51,872 --> 00:58:55,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's kind of an... You just place a placeholder date.

734
00:58:55,494 --> 00:59:00,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually, like I used to put it on a weird date like a Saturday or something like that in our system so that...

735
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:04,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's a placeholder date, but yeah, there's no date for it yet.

736
00:59:05,104 --> 00:59:10,433
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I'm 100% sure there's not an official date for it yet.

737
00:59:10,534 --> 00:59:14,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I haven't gotten an update from Activision in a while, so probably next time I get it.

738
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:21,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, rumors are the news of a release date could be coming out next week, as early as next week.

739
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:28,023
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think a lot of that's wishful thinking on the community and how sometimes that snowballs into, oh, this is news now.

740
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:34,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably what it was is a store jumped the gun and they built some POP for the store.

741
00:59:35,186 --> 01:00:00,775
[SPEAKER_16]: and plus if and Virtual M says the website list is that as this that's actually Virtual M probably just explained where the issue came from Best Buy didn't get that date from uh from Blizzard they got it from themselves probably in their own system and the store manager was like oh we gotta we gotta make sales for this let's get a sign made up and we're gonna we're gonna push more sales of this and it's February 1st in our system right here props to them for being you know uh

742
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:02,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Way to take initiative!

743
01:00:02,297 --> 01:00:04,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Take initiative, but at the same time you need to spell.

744
01:00:08,428 --> 01:00:11,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's move on to DarkSakura with some other gaming news.

745
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:11,934
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a rumor.

746
01:00:12,354 --> 01:00:13,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a rumor.

747
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about Kaz Hirai.

748
01:00:19,471 --> 01:00:19,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

749
01:00:20,532 --> 01:00:22,633
[SPEAKER_07]: He's being promoted to president of Sony.

750
01:00:23,174 --> 01:00:26,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That was actually put up by Nikkei, by the Japanese Stock Exchange.

751
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:30,779
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to be replacing Howard Stringer.

752
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:38,184
[SPEAKER_07]: The theory is by April it should be going on, but they have to finish everything through a board meeting.

753
01:00:39,165 --> 01:00:42,848
[SPEAKER_07]: and Stringer is staying on as the chairman and CEO.

754
01:00:43,669 --> 01:00:49,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we get a lot more Ridge Racer and giant enemy craps.

755
01:00:51,436 --> 01:00:55,159
[SPEAKER_07]: But man, Sony's kind of in relatively crappy shape.

756
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, first off, let me play this, then we'll come back.

757
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:06,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Because in honor of Kaz Harai ascending to the throne at the top of Sony, I think we have to play our very favorite clip from 2006.

758
01:01:06,203 --> 01:01:09,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.

759
01:01:10,085 --> 01:01:11,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer!

760
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:17,908
[SPEAKER_08]: The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.

761
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:23,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.

762
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Ridge Racer!

763
01:01:26,212 --> 01:01:35,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.

764
01:01:35,939 --> 01:01:38,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's this giant enemy crab.

765
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Ridge Racer!

766
01:01:41,383 --> 01:01:45,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

767
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:46,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ridge Racer!

768
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:49,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer!

769
01:01:49,203 --> 01:01:55,768
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 3 will retail for 599 US Dollars 599 US Dollars 599 US Dollars Giant enemy crab 599 599 599 US Dollars It's Ridge Racer!

770
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:06,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer

771
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:27,053
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

772
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,611
[SPEAKER_16]: However, look at that clip.

773
01:02:54,072 --> 01:02:57,414
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just history repeating itself all over again, isn't it?

774
01:02:58,135 --> 01:02:59,176
[SPEAKER_16]: It's too expensive.

775
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,479
[SPEAKER_16]: The games are, you know, hit and miss.

776
01:03:03,499 --> 01:03:04,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I gotta give them credit.

777
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,921
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a lot of interesting, stunning stuff.

778
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:08,242
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think a lot of people are really turned off by the price right now.

779
01:03:08,663 --> 01:03:11,345
[SPEAKER_16]: And in some ways, I kind of see history repeating itself here.

780
01:03:11,845 --> 01:03:15,368
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I would write off the Vita as a horrific failure yet.

781
01:03:15,568 --> 01:03:17,890
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it hasn't launched here in the US for one.

782
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,832
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it's gonna... I think it'll sell more than...

783
01:03:21,292 --> 01:03:26,616
[SPEAKER_16]: PSP is due in the same week, but I think the 3DS is going to stay on top.

784
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,597
[SPEAKER_14]: There is nothing coming out for the PSP.

785
01:03:28,978 --> 01:03:29,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

786
01:03:30,899 --> 01:03:33,121
[SPEAKER_14]: One game, but it's a visual novel.

787
01:03:34,238 --> 01:03:42,284
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can also point out something, last fiscal quarter, Sony lost 1.6 billion yen, which is about $20 million.

788
01:03:42,324 --> 01:03:45,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Or 13 million pounds.

789
01:03:46,248 --> 01:03:48,990
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, but it might age well.

790
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:49,550
[SPEAKER_16]: You never know.

791
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Like the PlayStation 3, everybody gave it shit in the beginning.

792
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:53,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody gave it shit.

793
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:54,934
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's come a long way.

794
01:03:55,395 --> 01:04:00,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And right now, you know, especially with everything we were saying with Microsoft at the top of the show, PlayStation 3...

795
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:04,062
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a pretty good system right now.

796
01:04:04,242 --> 01:04:08,765
[SPEAKER_16]: It really depends on the games you want and the exclusives and all that, but it's a worthy competitor to the Xbox 360.

797
01:04:08,805 --> 01:04:10,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think anyone would have said that in 2006.

798
01:04:10,526 --> 01:04:18,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, I think with the 3DS and stuff, I don't see them squeezing out a lot more power out of that system than the stuff that's out right now.

799
01:04:18,812 --> 01:04:24,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, sure, there's going to be some games that look pretty nice and can do a little bit more, but 3D is all they got.

800
01:04:24,496 --> 01:04:26,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you don't like the 3D, you got to DS.

801
01:04:26,978 --> 01:04:28,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's pretty much it.

802
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:30,236
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

803
01:04:43,453 --> 01:05:08,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Where eventually, a couple months later, the older DSs were outselling the 3DS And now look where the 3DS is I mean, all it took was a few powerhouse games And now nobody's joking about the 3DS Everybody's like, within a matter of months Everybody's like, okay, yeah, 3DS, here to stay It's happening No one's arguing that the fact that the 3DS launch versus the Vita launch I mean, the launch games are way better on the Vita There's actually stuff that people would like on there

804
01:05:09,435 --> 01:05:11,856
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm probably not going to get one at launch because it is too damn expensive.

805
01:05:12,056 --> 01:05:15,717
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, I don't play my 3DS enough.

806
01:05:15,797 --> 01:05:21,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, fuck, I've only played Super Mario 3D Land once, and I'm not going to buy any system.

807
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:27,661
[SPEAKER_16]: GameGuru in our chatroom says, well, yeah, 3DS stole Monster Hunter, which is what everyone bought the PSP for in Japan.

808
01:05:28,021 --> 01:05:31,543
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, those few key games can really sell a system.

809
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:39,470
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you cannot deny that Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 is the reason why 3DS, nobody's, you know, joking about it anymore.

810
01:05:40,912 --> 01:05:42,534
[SPEAKER_16]: And Monster Hunter in Japan, certainly.

811
01:05:43,074 --> 01:05:44,496
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, so, anyhow.

812
01:05:45,497 --> 01:05:49,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so, Kazurai, I mean, it'll...

813
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:51,842
[SPEAKER_16]: These things happen, you know.

814
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:53,062
[SPEAKER_14]: But don't buy Ridge Racer.

815
01:05:53,442 --> 01:05:55,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Do not buy Ridge Racer for the Vita.

816
01:05:55,703 --> 01:06:09,889
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to buy a game for the Vita, seriously, if you're trying to buy a cheap game, if you're looking to buy a cheap game from Namco, buy Touch My Katamari because that's $30 and you get a full game versus $30 and get three tracks and five cars.

817
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:14,611
[SPEAKER_16]: All My Eyes in chat says, but Sony doesn't have a system seller like Mario or Mario Kart.

818
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,893
[SPEAKER_16]: They do have Uncharted, which is a pretty big deal over here.

819
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:19,114
[SPEAKER_14]: They have Uncharted.

820
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,115
[SPEAKER_14]: They have Wipeout.

821
01:06:20,155 --> 01:06:24,619
[SPEAKER_14]: If you like Wipeout, they have... Well, Hot Shots Golf actually did pretty well in Japan.

822
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,961
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not right at launch.

823
01:06:27,181 --> 01:06:29,363
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't put Wipeout on the same level as Mario Kart.

824
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:29,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I really wouldn't.

825
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:33,627
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not at launch, but... Well, they have Mod Nation Racers.

826
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:34,447
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a launch title.

827
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:35,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't put that on the same level as Mario Kart.

828
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:39,832
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, Sony's big things are God of War, Uncharted.

829
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:41,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, within a month, LittleBigPlanet.

830
01:06:42,434 --> 01:06:42,934
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be big.

831
01:06:43,095 --> 01:06:43,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

832
01:06:44,636 --> 01:06:59,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Luminous for me and third party games Luminous I don't see as a launch sales well I haven't gotten the Ubisoft updates yet but I haven't seen any there to launch stuff but in third party stuff I mean you've got Ninja Gaiden Sigma I mean that's a pretty hardcore game

833
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:05,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Blaze Blue, Continuum Shift Extend, the MMA game from 505, Supremacy MMA, and

834
01:07:15,151 --> 01:07:21,854
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a FIFA game and Ridge Racer, Touch My Katamari, which looks pretty good.

835
01:07:22,074 --> 01:07:23,114
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of good games.

836
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:26,476
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like where, huh, well, let's see.

837
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,797
[SPEAKER_14]: There's Nintendogs and a submarine game.

838
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:30,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and Pilotwings.

839
01:07:31,478 --> 01:07:32,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Steel Diver.

840
01:07:32,398 --> 01:07:32,639
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

841
01:07:33,419 --> 01:07:38,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Rama in our chat says, if Sony knocked the price of the Vita down to $199, they wouldn't need a system seller per se.

842
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:40,302
[SPEAKER_16]: They'd be losing a lot of money.

843
01:07:41,082 --> 01:07:42,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

844
01:07:42,803 --> 01:07:44,485
[SPEAKER_16]: But isn't it common to lose money on systems?

845
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:45,445
[SPEAKER_16]: You make it back up with the games?

846
01:07:45,886 --> 01:07:48,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Plus, the Vita does have a lot that's not just games.

847
01:07:49,028 --> 01:07:50,089
[SPEAKER_16]: That's another thing.

848
01:07:50,129 --> 01:07:55,153
[SPEAKER_16]: It does have strengths in... Just like the PSP had the web browser, had the MP3s.

849
01:07:55,413 --> 01:07:57,334
[SPEAKER_16]: People call into the show on their PSPs.

850
01:07:57,415 --> 01:07:57,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean...

851
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:18,696
[SPEAKER_14]: you know let's see all my eyes agree it's true if they knock the price down to $199 I would buy it and Yuki follows it up with same so the price is they're not going to lose $100 on every system I mean that's just stupid I mean it's stupid but at the same time I think it's fucking retarded that I've got to buy another memory card that doesn't come with the system I mean

852
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:23,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell, the original PSP, I think, came with a 32 megabyte memory card.

853
01:08:23,578 --> 01:08:27,039
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree that if they wanted to get, they would put a small memory card in there.

854
01:08:27,099 --> 01:08:31,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, like, I mean, even half, not even half a gig, but like, let's do a one gig card.

855
01:08:31,961 --> 01:08:35,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, those things cannot be the price to manufacture that they're charging.

856
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think they would be taking a big loss by throwing one in.

857
01:08:38,184 --> 01:08:39,304
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that would really sweeten the pot.

858
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:44,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I kid you not, every single one of those games requires a memory card.

859
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:46,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And so here's a fun situation.

860
01:08:47,008 --> 01:08:47,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I go buy a Vita.

861
01:08:48,288 --> 01:08:49,630
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're sold out of memory cards.

862
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck, I can't play anything.

863
01:08:52,973 --> 01:08:54,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we gotta move on.

864
01:08:54,074 --> 01:08:56,857
[SPEAKER_16]: We're running long in Part A. Let's move on with some more news, Loki.

865
01:08:57,778 --> 01:08:59,360
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just like a great plan right there.

866
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:00,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, guess what?

867
01:09:01,122 --> 01:09:10,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, there's some insiders that say that there's gonna be the new unveiling of a new Xbox and new PlayStation, this E3.

868
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:23,887
[SPEAKER_14]: and they apparently have it from a very very very very very very very very very reliable source and this is MCV reporting this as well that both of these new consoles will be making their debut at E3

869
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:27,803
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not surprised.

870
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:33,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, though, that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be out this year or even next year.

871
01:09:33,985 --> 01:09:36,206
[SPEAKER_14]: I could see them coming out maybe fall of next year.

872
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:40,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I call bull on this story because I would believe the Xbox.

873
01:09:41,448 --> 01:09:46,770
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's about time for the Xbox to show off their next console, but I don't think PlayStation 4.

874
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,551
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we need it yet.

875
01:09:49,211 --> 01:09:52,272
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like PlayStation 3 took so long to get to its prime that

876
01:09:52,892 --> 01:09:55,494
[SPEAKER_16]: I almost kind of believe the whole 10-year cycle thing.

877
01:09:55,554 --> 01:10:01,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I think PlayStation 4 coming out this soon, showing it this year, I don't know.

878
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:04,338
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's the Vita.

879
01:10:04,418 --> 01:10:05,699
[SPEAKER_16]: They've got to push the Vita.

880
01:10:05,879 --> 01:10:07,400
[SPEAKER_16]: They've got to push that through the holidays.

881
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,540
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't understand, though, Rob.

882
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,942
[SPEAKER_14]: A 10-year cycle doesn't necessarily mean that, boom, after 10 years they launch a new console.

883
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:15,924
[SPEAKER_14]: It means that they launch a new console and it overlaps for three years.

884
01:10:16,204 --> 01:10:22,652
[SPEAKER_16]: I just... In my gut, you know, just says there can't be the PlayStation 4 this early.

885
01:10:23,012 --> 01:10:25,035
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just too damn early for the PlayStation 4.

886
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,977
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a reliable source, though.

887
01:10:27,017 --> 01:10:28,219
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so reliable.

888
01:10:28,299 --> 01:10:30,261
[SPEAKER_14]: The source and the reliability.

889
01:10:31,122 --> 01:10:33,905
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's so reliable.

890
01:10:35,954 --> 01:10:38,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to get their quote because it was hilarious.

891
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:43,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, don't have the quote.

892
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:44,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well.

893
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:46,991
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one guy that's like, I can guarantee it 100%.

894
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:48,634
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be there.

895
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,010
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's going to be there?

896
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:52,891
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii U. And my disappointment.

897
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:55,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, you know what?

898
01:10:55,852 --> 01:11:00,713
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be interested to see what's going to happen next week during the whole CES stuff.

899
01:11:01,273 --> 01:11:02,634
[SPEAKER_16]: CES is never really gaming.

900
01:11:03,594 --> 01:11:13,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Nintendo is going to be there with the Wii U. Yeah, but they swear up and down it's just the exact same thing they showed at E3 for people who weren't able to wait in that horrifically long line.

901
01:11:13,897 --> 01:11:14,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and I don't think they need to.

902
01:11:15,178 --> 01:11:16,738
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, CES really isn't a gaming show.

903
01:11:17,518 --> 01:11:24,181
[SPEAKER_16]: The biggest game news I can think of that ever came out of CES was the Microsoft Game Room was a big thing that came out.

904
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:30,203
[SPEAKER_16]: And unfortunately, Microsoft Game Room didn't last, which is such a... Don't get me on that tangent.

905
01:11:30,243 --> 01:11:34,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Game Room had so much freaking potential, and now it's like ruined it for everything else.

906
01:11:35,084 --> 01:11:39,646
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so mad about Game Room because it could have been so much more awesome.

907
01:11:40,526 --> 01:11:41,186
[SPEAKER_16]: It really should have been.

908
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:41,627
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway.

909
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:42,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

910
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:47,051
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think the big thing is Windows 8.

911
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:51,633
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll see more stuff about PC and bigger TVs and 3D TVs and all that.

912
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,775
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's a lot about gaming consoles.

913
01:11:54,195 --> 01:12:02,060
[SPEAKER_16]: You might see little things, especially from Microsoft and the 360 because they're really trying to make the 360 this whole centerpiece.

914
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're going to be showing off some new channels.

915
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:09,124
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you want to take a total shot in the dark...

916
01:12:09,844 --> 01:12:14,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe something akin to the 1 versus 100 thing getting announced.

917
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:17,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Some type of entertainment channel.

918
01:12:17,346 --> 01:12:18,787
[SPEAKER_14]: So how are you digging those channels?

919
01:12:18,827 --> 01:12:22,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I've stopped downloading them because I just don't give a shit about them anymore.

920
01:12:23,768 --> 01:12:25,449
[SPEAKER_16]: They're kind of pointless, I hate to say it.

921
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:30,231
[SPEAKER_16]: The only one I could ever see myself using is that maybe I would use iHeartRadio if I was hosting a party.

922
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Because there are some decent stations on there with very few commercials.

923
01:12:33,332 --> 01:12:34,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the HD simulcasts.

924
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:45,062
[SPEAKER_16]: you know that play like dance music or comedy on loop it's kind of like having the satellite radio that's the one that I'm kind of like I could see myself using this but the rest not really

925
01:12:46,952 --> 01:12:48,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

926
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:50,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like the new interface, to be honest.

927
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:55,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, I hate the interface, but that doesn't mean I don't like the point of some of the channels.

928
01:12:55,398 --> 01:12:56,699
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Netflix channel, certainly.

929
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Although, actually, I find it better on my PS3.

930
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:05,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you think now that we have the technology where we could, I don't know, select the interface we want?

931
01:13:07,027 --> 01:13:07,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Thought?

932
01:13:07,527 --> 01:13:07,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe?

933
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:09,288
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be nice.

934
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:11,290
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the technology, we can select it.

935
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:32,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, well speaking of rumors, there are some rumors about the Really good Fleetwood Mac album There are some rumors about the Xbox Lube, because remember that's what we're calling it now If you don't know why we're calling the new Xbox system the Xbox Lube, you have to go back and listen to some old episodes But apparently the Xbox Lube is supposed to be, this sounds really slick, supposed to be a DVR as well

936
01:13:34,608 --> 01:13:46,076
[SPEAKER_16]: This is according to some patents that are floating around out there that apparently on December 27th the US Patent Office gave Microsoft a patent for a device that would be a game console and a DVR.

937
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:53,241
[SPEAKER_16]: A digital video recorder application running alongside a television client component allows users to record media content on the gaming console.

938
01:13:53,621 --> 01:13:56,743
[SPEAKER_16]: The DVR application also integrates itself with the console menu.

939
01:13:57,223 --> 01:13:59,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Once integrated, users can record media content while playing games.

940
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:03,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Alternatively, users can record content when the gaming console is turned off.

941
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:11,211
[SPEAKER_16]: The recorded content can include television programming, gaming experience, whether local or online, music, DVDs, and so on.

942
01:14:11,631 --> 01:14:17,654
[SPEAKER_16]: When in the recording state, users can also switch between various other media modes, whether gaming, television, and so on.

943
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:25,201
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this would be more something that would be integrated into a television set or integrated into a set-top box that would be from a cable provider.

944
01:14:25,802 --> 01:14:26,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's my other thing.

945
01:14:26,843 --> 01:14:32,168
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, although I could certainly see this being feasible for the next system, why does it have to be the next system?

946
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:36,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't it feasible that they could release a 360 that has a DVR built in?

947
01:14:37,801 --> 01:14:43,244
[SPEAKER_07]: They could do that, but I mean, I think that by saying it's in their next thing, that makes it a selling point.

948
01:14:43,944 --> 01:14:44,545
[SPEAKER_16]: True, true.

949
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:49,047
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it is kind of a big thing, but that's the type of thing.

950
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:50,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, how well did the HD clear?

951
01:14:51,068 --> 01:14:53,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Hypothetically, let's say it was in the 360.

952
01:14:53,429 --> 01:14:55,990
[SPEAKER_16]: That I could see coming out of CES.

953
01:14:57,571 --> 01:14:58,712
[SPEAKER_14]: I think DarkSakura is right.

954
01:14:58,752 --> 01:15:00,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's going to be the next system.

955
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:02,974
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm telling you, it's never going to happen on its own.

956
01:15:03,074 --> 01:15:05,695
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be something from a cable provider.

957
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:13,179
[SPEAKER_14]: The cable providers are going to be like, hey, we're providing content to you and you're going to offer a DVR so now we can't charge people the fee that costs...

958
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:20,960
[SPEAKER_14]: to rent the DVR system out, you know, and they don't have to buy our higher tier programs to get a DVR.

959
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,561
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna pull this shit on us?

960
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:24,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck that, we want some of that money.

961
01:15:24,481 --> 01:15:25,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's not gonna happen.

962
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:31,942
[SPEAKER_14]: They're gonna put that shit out themselves and it's gonna be kind of like, hey, you can get Comcast and you get a game player as well.

963
01:15:32,382 --> 01:15:35,603
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, a Comcast box and you get games and you can do all this stuff.

964
01:15:35,903 --> 01:15:38,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Or it's gonna be integrated into a TV, you know, something like that.

965
01:15:38,703 --> 01:15:40,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm telling you, they're not gonna...

966
01:15:42,285 --> 01:15:43,306
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I would love it.

967
01:15:43,426 --> 01:15:49,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be great if we could have a DVR because then I can DVR shit without having to pay my cable writer to do it.

968
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:52,157
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just don't see that happening.

969
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:53,098
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a pipe dream.

970
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,905
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's DivX, or not DivX, there's TiVo, but who the fuck uses TiVo anymore?

971
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:14,262
[SPEAKER_16]: uh yeah you got some support in chat room Loki a lot of folks uh agree with you Derek H says Loki is correct I think he's saying it about this I don't know because of the delay there's like a minute delay but uh Ranma in the chat says the console as a DVR will cause a problem because cable providers will not support it

972
01:16:15,535 --> 01:16:15,815
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right.

973
01:16:15,835 --> 01:16:19,356
[SPEAKER_16]: There are cable providers in agreement with Xbox.

974
01:16:19,816 --> 01:16:22,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Comcast, our local one, is supposed to come on board in early 2012.

975
01:16:22,877 --> 01:16:26,457
[SPEAKER_16]: That will be shown at CES for sure.

976
01:16:26,657 --> 01:16:29,738
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can DVR whatever.

977
01:16:29,838 --> 01:16:33,039
[SPEAKER_14]: I can DVR X show or whatever.

978
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:36,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just say I can set it up like a TV.

979
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:36,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I can set it up.

980
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:37,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I want to record a season of this.

981
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would I buy the content off of their service?

982
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I already DVR'd it.

983
01:16:43,321 --> 01:16:44,401
[SPEAKER_14]: They're losing sales that way.

984
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:44,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Then

985
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:46,022
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

986
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:16,842
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gotta be something that's coming from them, like a new set-top box.

987
01:17:16,902 --> 01:17:18,944
[SPEAKER_16]: What if it just worked with an over-the-air TV, though?

988
01:17:19,044 --> 01:17:23,369
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, remember, you can hook an antenna to your TV and get these magical channels that come through.

989
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and it works fantastic.

990
01:17:25,372 --> 01:17:26,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tune in zero channels.

991
01:17:27,074 --> 01:17:28,756
[SPEAKER_16]: It depends on where you live and your connection.

992
01:17:30,488 --> 01:17:31,028
[SPEAKER_14]: It's terrible.

993
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:35,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I need like a big old retro antenna to get out of my roof in order to get that shit to work.

994
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,512
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they don't look like that anymore.

995
01:17:36,612 --> 01:17:37,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Now they're like square.

996
01:17:37,673 --> 01:17:38,814
[SPEAKER_16]: They're totally different.

997
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:39,134
[SPEAKER_14]: They suck.

998
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:40,295
[SPEAKER_14]: They suck ass.

999
01:17:40,335 --> 01:17:42,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, I tried hooking one up too.

1000
01:17:43,257 --> 01:17:45,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, yeah, I'm going to put this up.

1001
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get on my HDTV for free.

1002
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:48,601
[SPEAKER_14]: It worked like crap.

1003
01:17:49,061 --> 01:17:49,782
[SPEAKER_14]: I got nothing.

1004
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:53,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even a Spanish channel that came in correctly.

1005
01:17:53,645 --> 01:17:57,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Although when I was programming, it actually got worse every time I tried to find stations.

1006
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:02,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have to say, to be perfectly honest, I have no use for DVR.

1007
01:18:03,562 --> 01:18:04,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't watch TV.

1008
01:18:04,703 --> 01:18:05,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan doesn't watch TV.

1009
01:18:05,563 --> 01:18:06,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that we watch is streamed.

1010
01:18:07,664 --> 01:18:09,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say BBC America, maybe?

1011
01:18:10,244 --> 01:18:11,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Supernatural on CW?

1012
01:18:11,505 --> 01:18:14,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I download my shows on the internet because I hate commercials.

1013
01:18:15,606 --> 01:18:19,507
[SPEAKER_16]: And besides that, you know... But commercials are what provide your free television.

1014
01:18:20,282 --> 01:18:29,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't watch the TV I mean, Dan, the only shows that he watches is like Sons of Anarchy and Top Gear and guess what?

1015
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,091
[SPEAKER_07]: He streams them from other places

1016
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:34,089
[SPEAKER_16]: We're paying for cable.

1017
01:18:34,129 --> 01:18:35,049
[SPEAKER_16]: We rarely use it.

1018
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,210
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually downgraded our TV cable and upgraded our internet cable.

1019
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:42,771
[SPEAKER_16]: See, I'm thinking about it, but then that'll be when the next season of RuPaul's Drag Race starts.

1020
01:18:42,911 --> 01:18:43,971
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, I gotta have logo.

1021
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:45,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't wait till the next day.

1022
01:18:45,911 --> 01:18:46,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Gotta have it.

1023
01:18:47,392 --> 01:18:49,072
[SPEAKER_16]: I cannot sashay away my cable.

1024
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:59,114
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing, too, about CW shows, Rob, is that by the time it airs at its normal time, someone's already uploaded it from the East Coast showing.

1025
01:19:00,214 --> 01:19:00,955
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1026
01:19:26,769 --> 01:19:35,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they're trying not to rely on LittleBigPlanet as their primary safety net, if you will.

1027
01:19:36,096 --> 01:19:41,659
[SPEAKER_07]: They are trying to actually expand into different audiences.

1028
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:45,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've been spending about... And this is from a British news source.

1029
01:19:45,862 --> 01:19:47,983
[SPEAKER_07]: They're spending about 3.44 million pounds...

1030
01:19:52,426 --> 01:19:52,667
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

1031
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:17,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really smart too because, you know, say that you've got a company that's good for just one thing and that's all they've been doing.

1032
01:20:18,044 --> 01:20:20,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But after a while, the franchise is stale.

1033
01:20:20,626 --> 01:20:27,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I honestly think LittleBigPlanet, before too long, is going to hit that place where people are going to expect the same thing.

1034
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,551
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's not going to be able to put much new into it.

1035
01:20:31,732 --> 01:20:36,094
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a big problem is LittleBigPlanet is really a limitless game.

1036
01:20:36,234 --> 01:20:40,255
[SPEAKER_16]: There's so much you can do with it, but I think it's the saturation that's going to be an issue.

1037
01:20:40,715 --> 01:20:47,138
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's not really on Media Molecule, but it's like you have your PSP version and your Vita version and it's coming out on everything.

1038
01:20:47,605 --> 01:20:48,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's a quote on here.

1039
01:20:48,726 --> 01:21:05,480
[SPEAKER_07]: They say that their investments are going into, and this is the quote, leading edge physics and dynamics, rapid world creation from laser data, innovative routes to marketing, to market via web-based interfaces, 3D stereo optics for advanced simulation, and use of high-def data capture and processing techniques.

1040
01:21:06,547 --> 01:21:09,330
[SPEAKER_07]: They're making the holodeck, basically.

1041
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,874
[SPEAKER_07]: They're making the PlayStation holodeck.

1042
01:21:23,007 --> 01:21:37,851
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to make it where I think it's not just they're extending to Immerse but they're actually trying to draw in your feedback into the game to make it customizable into whatever they're working on.

1043
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:42,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Derek H in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says 1.5 million to find new games?

1044
01:21:42,332 --> 01:21:44,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on, that's just another way to write hookers and blow.

1045
01:21:45,723 --> 01:21:46,303
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think so.

1046
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps.

1047
01:21:48,464 --> 01:21:49,945
[SPEAKER_16]: I would buy a game called Hookers and Blow.

1048
01:21:51,785 --> 01:21:55,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially if it's that whole 3D immersive experience.

1049
01:21:55,647 --> 01:22:00,648
[SPEAKER_16]: You see her nose that's about to snort the cocaine just jumping right out of the TV.

1050
01:22:01,008 --> 01:22:01,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Man Horse.

1051
01:22:03,629 --> 01:22:04,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you need to play Saints Row the Third.

1052
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:05,610
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1053
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:09,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if somebody would lend it to me, I could play it.

1054
01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:10,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just lazy.

1055
01:22:10,774 --> 01:22:13,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's move on and travel the world with some release dates.

1056
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:16,598
[SPEAKER_16]: And Loki, start us off with the U.S.

1057
01:22:16,638 --> 01:22:19,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Although, like last week, there was literally nothing.

1058
01:22:19,661 --> 01:22:21,242
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if this week's the same thing.

1059
01:22:21,422 --> 01:22:24,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there's pretty much nothing.

1060
01:22:25,064 --> 01:22:27,186
[SPEAKER_14]: This week, there is...

1061
01:22:29,887 --> 01:22:32,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, not much.

1062
01:22:32,768 --> 01:22:36,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe My Pet Puppy 3D from Five by Five Games.

1063
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:37,790
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say that that got delayed.

1064
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:39,991
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't honestly... Well, here.

1065
01:22:40,151 --> 01:22:41,171
[SPEAKER_14]: My Pet Puppy!

1066
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:41,992
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no.

1067
01:22:42,472 --> 01:22:44,292
[SPEAKER_14]: I will get you the definitive list here.

1068
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:45,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1069
01:22:46,133 --> 01:23:04,318
[SPEAKER_14]: but yeah I seriously it was like nothing I think was actually this week we had like three re-releases of some UMD games that were from well that was actually like this week but let's see coming out this week

1070
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:09,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, yes.

1071
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:11,050
[SPEAKER_14]: There is pretty much nothing.

1072
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:14,672
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let's start off with 4-in-1 Action Pack from South Peak Games.

1073
01:23:14,732 --> 01:23:25,857
[SPEAKER_14]: It's four games that were featured on the PlayStation Network, and they're all terrible, including Mushroom Wars, Digger, Wave... Was it...

1074
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:32,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Smash Cars, and Wakeboarding HD.

1075
01:23:34,008 --> 01:23:34,288
[SPEAKER_14]: All for $20.

1076
01:23:36,028 --> 01:23:38,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, that's pretty good, right?

1077
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:42,850
[SPEAKER_14]: National Geographic Challenge for PlayStation 3 as well this week.

1078
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:44,350
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is it.

1079
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:46,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the two games you can expect this week.

1080
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:51,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Except, I bet you anything, 4-in-1 Action Pack doesn't come out this week.

1081
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:53,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe one game.

1082
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:54,572
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all you get.

1083
01:23:55,052 --> 01:23:55,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're all terrible?

1084
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:00,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, yeah, well, I mean, I don't know if they're absolutely terrible.

1085
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:01,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking forward to Mushroom Wars.

1086
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:07,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're, for five bucks, I mean, for five bucks a game, I mean, that's not bad.

1087
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,617
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I would think this is...

1088
01:24:10,461 --> 01:24:12,061
[SPEAKER_14]: No one's looking for this game, seriously.

1089
01:24:12,122 --> 01:24:15,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of being diarrhea, it's just solid poop.

1090
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:16,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, stop.

1091
01:24:16,703 --> 01:24:18,944
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's move to the Japanese release date.

1092
01:24:19,104 --> 01:24:22,325
[SPEAKER_16]: There's at least a couple things this week in Japan.

1093
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:25,766
[SPEAKER_16]: On the PlayStation 3, there's a game called Time Leap coming out.

1094
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:27,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure what Time Leap is.

1095
01:24:27,506 --> 01:24:32,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, I want to think Time Crisis, but it's actually... Time Leap is a romance dating game.

1096
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:34,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I've played one of those.

1097
01:24:34,628 --> 01:24:37,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, it animates the characters in real time.

1098
01:24:38,218 --> 01:24:38,978
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1099
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,295
[SPEAKER_16]: PSP Super Robot Taisen OG Saga

1100
01:25:14,918 --> 01:25:22,044
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when I hear OG Saga, I'm thinking like, you know, some old school rapper or something like that.

1101
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:23,785
[SPEAKER_16]: The 50 cent games are huge in Japan, go figure.

1102
01:25:23,845 --> 01:25:26,607
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Snoop Dogg in a fucking mech, that'd be awesome.

1103
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:30,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Nintendo 3DS gets Ace Combat 3D Cross Rumble.

1104
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:32,032
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there's some Ace Combat fans.

1105
01:25:32,412 --> 01:25:35,615
[SPEAKER_16]: The Adventures of Tintin the game gets its Japanese release this week.

1106
01:25:36,776 --> 01:25:38,597
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's it.

1107
01:25:38,938 --> 01:25:41,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing on the old school DS or anything else.

1108
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,021
[SPEAKER_16]: So a slow week in Japan.

1109
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:43,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1110
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:46,164
[SPEAKER_16]: How about the UK?

1111
01:25:47,085 --> 01:25:48,466
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some stuff on the 10th.

1112
01:25:48,806 --> 01:25:49,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotham City Imposters.

1113
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:51,669
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 11th, we have Amy.

1114
01:25:54,811 --> 01:25:55,752
[SPEAKER_16]: That game was delayed.

1115
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:58,173
[SPEAKER_16]: It was delayed at the last minute.

1116
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:02,355
[SPEAKER_16]: So it might not show on the calendar you're using, but Gotham City Impostors was delayed to February.

1117
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:03,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Good, because it looks like poop.

1118
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:04,717
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember reading a story on it.

1119
01:26:04,757 --> 01:26:05,857
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't look like poop.

1120
01:26:05,937 --> 01:26:08,319
[SPEAKER_16]: It just looks like Team Fortress 2 with Batman.

1121
01:26:08,339 --> 01:26:10,420
[SPEAKER_16]: She got on here last week and talked about how horrible it looks.

1122
01:26:12,153 --> 01:26:35,571
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 11th is Amy for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and Choplifter HD for Xbox 360, PC, PlayStation 3 Choplifter HD is so awesome, it has a Duke Nukem cameo Nice Because everyone cares about Duke Nukem nowadays On January 13th is Crushed on the 3DS, or maybe Crushed 3D It's Crushed, but they put the 3 and D in there, so you can kind of go

1123
01:26:36,759 --> 01:26:38,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's Crushed.

1124
01:26:39,301 --> 01:26:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it's Crushed.

1125
01:26:44,605 --> 01:26:45,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Crushed 3Ds.

1126
01:26:47,647 --> 01:26:48,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1127
01:26:48,468 --> 01:26:48,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Done.

1128
01:26:49,488 --> 01:26:52,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Our release dates have been crushed.

1129
01:26:53,071 --> 01:26:56,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1130
01:26:56,113 --> 01:26:59,976
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, we kind of sounded like, what was that anime club thing on Saturday Night Live?

1131
01:27:01,121 --> 01:27:02,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't even watch that.

1132
01:27:02,902 --> 01:27:04,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched it because of John.

1133
01:27:04,442 --> 01:27:07,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, you know what was sad is that I know people like that.

1134
01:27:07,384 --> 01:27:08,264
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Loki.

1135
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:14,026
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's going to be some changes coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.

1136
01:27:15,627 --> 01:27:20,129
[SPEAKER_14]: This includes that they've now allowed people to, you know,

1137
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:21,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1138
01:27:50,318 --> 01:27:57,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and then, of course, they've also raised the number of caps of titles that any developers allowed to host on Xbox Live Indie Games.

1139
01:27:58,444 --> 01:28:01,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, originally it was 10, now they can have a total of 20 games at a time.

1140
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:05,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so, neat, I guess.

1141
01:28:06,189 --> 01:28:11,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, none of the changes that they made have made it easier to find Xbox Live Indie Games on the actual service, so...

1142
01:28:12,933 --> 01:28:13,473
[SPEAKER_16]: That's too bad.

1143
01:28:13,513 --> 01:28:24,736
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be posting lots of direct links when Bungie Ferret Tossing comes out, which now with the expanded space, I'm expecting Aaron to include video clips of ferrets and clips from our show.

1144
01:28:24,836 --> 01:28:25,397
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm just kidding.

1145
01:28:25,537 --> 01:28:26,257
[SPEAKER_16]: He can do whatever he wants.

1146
01:28:26,277 --> 01:28:28,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, you need to get some of that ferret B-roll.

1147
01:28:31,418 --> 01:28:35,960
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to be able to put in the Konami code and just get actual videos of ferrets.

1148
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,360
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be great.

1149
01:28:39,431 --> 01:28:42,114
[SPEAKER_16]: I was suggesting from the kitchen that it be played backwards.

1150
01:28:59,013 --> 01:29:02,154
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, one other story for you guys before the Classic Game of the Week.

1151
01:29:02,174 --> 01:29:08,017
[SPEAKER_16]: We were talking about the Vita a minute ago, and oh, you know the old saying on this show, hackers gonna hack.

1152
01:29:08,317 --> 01:29:12,539
[SPEAKER_16]: So how long did it take the... Did Sony ever claim that the Vita was unhackable?

1153
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:13,540
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that claim ever made?

1154
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think they did this time.

1155
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,281
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think that they just assumed.

1156
01:29:16,581 --> 01:29:17,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, it's been done.

1157
01:29:18,022 --> 01:29:23,004
[SPEAKER_16]: The Vita's already been hacked, and the first thing that's been running on it, Genesis Games.

1158
01:29:23,544 --> 01:29:24,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1159
01:29:24,405 --> 01:29:25,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And not Linux.

1160
01:29:25,725 --> 01:29:26,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Not a bad idea.

1161
01:29:26,706 --> 01:29:29,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Sonic and Knuckle, why are you cheering not Linux?

1162
01:29:30,808 --> 01:29:33,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm kind of getting... I see.

1163
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:35,031
[SPEAKER_16]: The quintessential thing is to install Linux.

1164
01:29:35,231 --> 01:29:35,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1165
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:38,033
[SPEAKER_07]: When you hack the system, you put Linux on it.

1166
01:29:38,073 --> 01:29:39,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Write your Hello World program.

1167
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:41,535
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure someone did that, but...

1168
01:29:42,415 --> 01:29:47,680
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something that people want to download and use a lot of is the Genesis games on the PlayStation Vita.

1169
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:51,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Sonic & Knuckles now apparently running on the PlayStation Vita.

1170
01:29:51,664 --> 01:29:52,745
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been out less than a month.

1171
01:29:53,265 --> 01:29:58,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, it's a homebrew Genesis emulator that was originally built for the PSP.

1172
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,393
[SPEAKER_16]: It's running on the Vita's PSP emulator.

1173
01:30:01,753 --> 01:30:02,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's right.

1174
01:30:02,454 --> 01:30:07,919
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an emulator emulating an emulator emulating a Sega.

1175
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:24,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Blast Processing And I've gone cross-eyed So there you go Sony apparently has put in some security that is going to make that exploit moot as soon as it is made available according to the video's uploader but how long is that going to last?

1176
01:30:24,688 --> 01:30:30,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Watch the PSP They patch, new exploit They patch, new exploit Watch the Wii They patch, new exploit

1177
01:30:31,448 --> 01:30:32,469
[SPEAKER_16]: They patch, new exploit.

1178
01:30:32,689 --> 01:30:34,231
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they just forget the patch.

1179
01:30:34,931 --> 01:30:36,233
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cycle continues.

1180
01:30:36,293 --> 01:30:37,674
[SPEAKER_16]: And at some point they just say, fuck it.

1181
01:30:38,695 --> 01:30:38,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1182
01:30:39,576 --> 01:30:43,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember back in the day when you didn't hack your system because you were playing a Genesis?

1183
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,581
[SPEAKER_07]: If I hacked it, I used an axe.

1184
01:30:46,743 --> 01:30:50,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember when you actually were playing Sonic & Knuckles on an actual Genesis?

1185
01:30:51,027 --> 01:30:52,108
[SPEAKER_07]: What, like two weeks ago?

1186
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:54,750
[SPEAKER_16]: So do we here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1187
01:30:55,851 --> 01:30:58,193
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, what should the kiddies be playing this week?

1188
01:31:15,362 --> 01:31:17,564
[SPEAKER_07]: In America, it was known as Rastan.

1189
01:31:18,905 --> 01:31:22,207
[SPEAKER_07]: In Japan and England, it was called Rastan Saga.

1190
01:31:23,428 --> 01:31:24,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It was put up by Taito.

1191
01:31:24,989 --> 01:31:27,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And he played a barbarian beating shit up.

1192
01:31:27,711 --> 01:31:28,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have some of that music, Rob.

1193
01:31:29,472 --> 01:31:30,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll that beautiful bean footage.

1194
01:31:35,117 --> 01:31:45,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been hearing this game music play endlessly because Dan has decided he's on a Rastan kick and has been watching video playthroughs of Rastan.

1195
01:31:45,564 --> 01:31:48,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me turn down the audio there so we can hear you.

1196
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,367
[SPEAKER_07]: God, so much Rastan.

1197
01:31:51,815 --> 01:31:54,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so it's sort of inspired by Greek mythology.

1198
01:31:55,257 --> 01:32:02,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got monsters coming out and you have to beat them up with your sword or an axe or hammers.

1199
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:06,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the weapons are also jewels and you get shields and mantles.

1200
01:32:07,102 --> 01:32:08,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You also can get a goat's head.

1201
01:32:09,063 --> 01:32:10,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it gives you a one-up or something.

1202
01:32:11,444 --> 01:32:12,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it an advertisement for God of War?

1203
01:32:13,865 --> 01:32:15,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe like seeing into the future?

1204
01:32:16,667 --> 01:32:17,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Gee, Robb.

1205
01:32:18,258 --> 01:32:29,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, as far as the background graphics for the arcade version, you actually had sunlight effects and it was fairly innovative for its time.

1206
01:32:29,721 --> 01:32:31,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the background on that video for a minute.

1207
01:32:32,302 --> 01:32:35,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And make sure that you send a link to Ranma for our Tumblr.

1208
01:32:36,683 --> 01:32:39,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I forgot Ranma was queen of the Tumblr now.

1209
01:32:39,364 --> 01:32:39,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1210
01:32:40,424 --> 01:32:41,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations on your promotion, Ranma.

1211
01:32:41,905 --> 01:32:45,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have a hard time hitting the Tumblr on my little dinky netbook.

1212
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:48,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, all our listeners, get Jamie Laptop.

1213
01:32:49,011 --> 01:32:49,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

1214
01:32:49,851 --> 01:32:50,331
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no, no.

1215
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:52,872
[SPEAKER_16]: You can use that guy, that rock over there that Alan was using last week.

1216
01:32:52,892 --> 01:32:53,272
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

1217
01:32:53,312 --> 01:32:53,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a new one.

1218
01:32:55,493 --> 01:33:04,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, with the Japanese version actually did get a full dedicated cabinet, but the North American and European ones never did.

1219
01:33:04,737 --> 01:33:05,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Theirs were kit conversions.

1220
01:33:06,257 --> 01:33:09,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could convert an existing cabinet to whatever the kit was.

1221
01:33:10,339 --> 01:33:13,240
[SPEAKER_07]: You had new buttons, joysticks, decals, marquees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1222
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:14,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1223
01:33:16,561 --> 01:33:26,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the opening to the story, as what's on this particular version, it was not included in any version but the Japanese version.

1224
01:33:27,172 --> 01:33:31,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So, here, sort of in a nutshell, and I'm just going to read from the article here.

1225
01:33:32,157 --> 01:33:38,283
[SPEAKER_07]: The game explains that he would be given all the treasures of an empire in exchange for a terrible dragon's head.

1226
01:33:39,544 --> 01:33:47,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you beat a stage, or the rounds as they're called, you actually get a victory screen that goes with the storyline.

1227
01:33:49,115 --> 01:33:57,445
[SPEAKER_07]: In the American version, there's just sort of the generic story, you were a warrior, you cleared this crap, hooray for you, here's some money, and some bitches.

1228
01:33:59,754 --> 01:34:03,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of, the opening scene, I have to say, makes me think of Conan.

1229
01:34:04,398 --> 01:34:08,742
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the end of the movie when he's sitting on his throne, but that is another story.

1230
01:34:08,763 --> 01:34:10,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, he also just looks like Conan.

1231
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:12,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, but, you know, this was the 80s.

1232
01:34:12,886 --> 01:34:15,349
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole barbarian thing was totally rocking on, you know.

1233
01:34:16,229 --> 01:34:21,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that this came out in, I want to say, 87?

1234
01:34:23,176 --> 01:34:23,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't quote me yet.

1235
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:31,844
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the ports that came out, there's a Sega Master System version, which I've got.

1236
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:35,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually had decent music, believe it or not.

1237
01:34:35,408 --> 01:34:37,310
[SPEAKER_07]: The Master System had pretty decent music.

1238
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:41,394
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an MSX version, a Game Gear version in 91.

1239
01:34:41,934 --> 01:34:44,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, for the record, the Master System and MSX versions came out in 88.

1240
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:57,608
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a PC one in 1990, Commodore 64 version in 1987, a Spectrum version in 87, CPC version in 88, an Apple IIGS in 1990.

1241
01:34:58,409 --> 01:35:02,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Commodore 64 version of the game was impossible to finish, Rob.

1242
01:35:04,234 --> 01:35:05,174
[SPEAKER_16]: How did they manage that?

1243
01:35:05,315 --> 01:35:06,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Had a bug in the game.

1244
01:35:06,536 --> 01:35:06,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yikes.

1245
01:35:06,916 --> 01:35:11,260
[SPEAKER_07]: The bug would prevent a player from making a particular jump from one platform to the other.

1246
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:12,401
[SPEAKER_07]: He would always fall short.

1247
01:35:12,721 --> 01:35:13,822
[SPEAKER_07]: He could never make it across.

1248
01:35:14,594 --> 01:35:15,495
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember that.

1249
01:35:15,555 --> 01:35:22,159
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I didn't play this game on 64, but that's gotta be irritating, to say the least.

1250
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:30,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for anyone who wants to play it now, it was included in Taito Legends for the PS2 and Xbox and PC in 2006.

1251
01:35:31,366 --> 01:35:33,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Which, funny enough, is how I've played this game.

1252
01:35:33,207 --> 01:35:35,329
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have Taito Legends, so...

1253
01:35:36,468 --> 01:35:37,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you get it for free?

1254
01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,849
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1255
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:39,309
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you won it.

1256
01:35:39,329 --> 01:35:45,231
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was... No, that was the year that you bought it when the Taito thing was going on at Classic Gaming Expo.

1257
01:35:45,251 --> 01:35:48,052
[SPEAKER_16]: You're thinking Classic Gaming Expo was the Midway Arcade Treasures.

1258
01:35:48,072 --> 01:35:48,472
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

1259
01:35:48,552 --> 01:35:50,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I batted my eyes and I flirted with the Midway lady.

1260
01:35:51,293 --> 01:35:51,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1261
01:35:53,294 --> 01:35:55,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so anyway... Who was very nice.

1262
01:35:55,074 --> 01:35:56,575
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very sad to see the Midways no more.

1263
01:35:57,745 --> 01:35:58,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there were two sequels.

1264
01:35:59,527 --> 01:36:06,633
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a game called Rastan Saga 2 that came out as Nastar in Europe and Nastar Warrior in North America.

1265
01:36:07,153 --> 01:36:09,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Warrior Blade Rastan Saga Episode 3.

1266
01:36:11,597 --> 01:36:20,726
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a 3D fighting game that was put out by Titus Software for PS2 and Nintendo GameCube that was called Barbarian in the U.S.,

1267
01:36:21,866 --> 01:36:27,847
[SPEAKER_07]: The game was licensed by Taito and called Warrior Blade Rastan vs. Barbarian when it came out in Japan.

1268
01:36:29,107 --> 01:36:30,848
[SPEAKER_07]: It also did come out in Europe later.

1269
01:36:33,048 --> 01:36:35,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't really have Rastan in it though.

1270
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:37,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't really related to the universe.

1271
01:36:37,149 --> 01:36:39,949
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, oh we can put Rastan on this and it will sell.

1272
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:47,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And he also made, the character Rastan made an appearance in a Taito game called Champion Wrestler as Miracle Rastan.

1273
01:36:49,452 --> 01:36:53,802
[SPEAKER_07]: And now this game, it came into some censorship issues.

1274
01:36:54,804 --> 01:37:03,727
[SPEAKER_07]: That while it wasn't really that adult content, it had blood splattered effects when you beat things.

1275
01:37:03,827 --> 01:37:05,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, spread pixels.

1276
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:07,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, right.

1277
01:37:08,469 --> 01:37:13,691
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the Sega Master System support, it actually had some boobage in it.

1278
01:37:14,471 --> 01:37:19,393
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gorgon and Harpies were very booby and puby.

1279
01:37:20,574 --> 01:37:20,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1280
01:37:21,494 --> 01:37:46,856
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Medusa itself is actually just is all boobies so but I mean that was before we had the ESRB so probably today it might have had an M rating how about that but no we got boobs in the 80s and that's it alright there it is your classic game of the week Rastan

1281
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Polish Chocolate Cake Chocolate Babka

1282
01:38:08,357 --> 01:38:08,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1283
01:38:09,238 --> 01:38:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Jewish.

1284
01:38:10,279 --> 01:38:10,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat it.

1285
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:11,359
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1286
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:12,120
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll have a little bit.

1287
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,021
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds delish.

1288
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:13,961
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1289
01:38:14,001 --> 01:38:16,403
[SPEAKER_16]: So while we feast on cake, we're going to take a break here.

1290
01:38:16,763 --> 01:38:17,644
[SPEAKER_16]: But don't go anywhere.

1291
01:38:17,664 --> 01:38:19,245
[SPEAKER_16]: There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1292
01:38:19,345 --> 01:38:30,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Lots more news still in Part B. Your emails, your tweets, if you tweet us right now at twitter.com slash OLR, your phone calls, and so much more when we come back on the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

1293
01:38:36,624 --> 01:38:39,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1294
01:38:39,386 --> 01:38:51,295
[SPEAKER_16]: We are live with this episode number 340, no, not 300, 441 for January the 8th of 2012, the whole new year here.

1295
01:38:52,395 --> 01:38:58,460
[SPEAKER_16]: We are live, of course, talking about video games, gaming lifestyle, all that stuff with you guys in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1296
01:38:58,820 --> 01:38:59,201
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

1297
01:39:14,898 --> 01:39:43,252
[SPEAKER_16]: or what have you and we played some music from OC Remix during the break I don't usually talk about this on the podcast but I had so many live people asking what those songs were and the fact that you can go to OC Remix and just download these for yourselves I'll go ahead and tell you what it was that first song was Will Rock was the artist from Mega Man 3 it was called Magnetic Fireworks and the second song we played there was a remix from the Goonies 2 password music screen believe it or not but I like that mix a lot that was TJ Neko with two K's N-E-K-K-O with I'm Taking It All Back

1298
01:39:43,772 --> 01:40:02,328
[SPEAKER_16]: was the name of that so those are the two songs from OC Remix we played so if you want podcast listeners what you could do is you stop right when you hear the music interlude go listen to those two songs then come back and it's like you were listening live but you know obviously for copyright reasons and so forth even though those songs are free to download on OC Remix it just isn't right for us to put them into our own darn show

1299
01:40:03,604 --> 01:40:10,689
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to be getting into some rapid-fire news here in a minute, but first, I thought I would talk Disneyland, because, you know, I went to Disneyland this week.

1300
01:40:10,989 --> 01:40:13,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't miss any shows because of it, because we went in the middle of the week.

1301
01:40:13,671 --> 01:40:14,972
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had, like, 18 days off of work.

1302
01:40:14,992 --> 01:40:15,812
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been the best thing ever.

1303
01:40:16,613 --> 01:40:17,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I sat on your cat.

1304
01:40:17,874 --> 01:40:22,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so DarkSakura was cat-sitting, which, of course, we're incredibly thankful for.

1305
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:25,319
[SPEAKER_16]: And we, well, we took some pictures.

1306
01:40:25,539 --> 01:40:26,199
[SPEAKER_16]: We took some pictures.

1307
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:30,983
[SPEAKER_16]: They actually had the Tron bike out at Electronica, so I was able to get that.

1308
01:40:31,763 --> 01:40:32,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Electronica open again?

1309
01:40:32,964 --> 01:40:34,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Electronica was open during the week.

1310
01:40:34,726 --> 01:40:35,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Go figure.

1311
01:40:35,426 --> 01:40:36,147
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it will be.

1312
01:40:36,547 --> 01:40:40,510
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the most crowded I have ever seen Disneyland this week.

1313
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:42,051
[SPEAKER_07]: If I get to go to the bonus day thing.

1314
01:40:42,171 --> 01:40:43,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the February 29th thing?

1315
01:40:43,132 --> 01:40:43,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1316
01:40:43,893 --> 01:40:44,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1317
01:40:44,233 --> 01:40:45,034
[SPEAKER_07]: You better have Electronica.

1318
01:40:45,054 --> 01:40:47,596
[SPEAKER_16]: That's Disneyland, not California Ventures.

1319
01:40:47,616 --> 01:40:48,556
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if they're going to do it.

1320
01:40:49,077 --> 01:40:49,998
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's just weekends.

1321
01:40:50,258 --> 01:40:54,101
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, they're definitely replacing Electronica come spring.

1322
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:59,683
[SPEAKER_16]: But you were looking at the pictures and DarkSakura was commenting that she really enjoyed the picture of Alan and I with Duffy.

1323
01:41:00,023 --> 01:41:01,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Duffy's your favorite Disney character.

1324
01:41:02,424 --> 01:41:03,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is Duffy your favorite Disney character?

1325
01:41:04,004 --> 01:41:04,805
[SPEAKER_07]: He's fucking cute.

1326
01:41:07,465 --> 01:41:09,226
[SPEAKER_16]: For those who don't know who Duffy is, who is Duffy?

1327
01:41:09,386 --> 01:41:12,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan calls Duffy a focus market bear.

1328
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:14,108
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, okay.

1329
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:16,729
[SPEAKER_07]: He was created at Hong Kong Disney.

1330
01:41:16,749 --> 01:41:17,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1331
01:41:20,225 --> 01:41:21,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I was chewing.

1332
01:41:21,306 --> 01:41:22,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the mouth of cake.

1333
01:41:23,408 --> 01:41:27,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, it was made by Hong Kong Disney.

1334
01:41:27,953 --> 01:41:29,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And he really picked up big in Japan.

1335
01:41:30,796 --> 01:41:32,438
[SPEAKER_07]: As, you know... Ah!

1336
01:41:32,498 --> 01:41:33,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Duffy Pin!

1337
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:36,843
[SPEAKER_16]: We got Jamie a pin and we got her a Duffy sticker.

1338
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:38,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually don't think I have that pin.

1339
01:41:38,744 --> 01:41:39,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1340
01:41:39,424 --> 01:41:39,845
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1341
01:41:40,625 --> 01:41:47,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but Duffy's just like this cute little bear that Minnie made for Mickey so that he would always have a companion when he went on his travels.

1342
01:41:47,429 --> 01:41:49,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, you don't have a Duffy bear yet though, right?

1343
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:51,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a purse and I have a tiny Duffy.

1344
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:53,253
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have the actual Duffy bear?

1345
01:41:54,033 --> 01:41:54,213
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1346
01:41:54,494 --> 01:41:56,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what if I told you right behind you...

1347
01:42:03,464 --> 01:42:03,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.

1348
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:05,334
[SPEAKER_16]: That's mine.

1349
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:05,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Leave it alone.

1350
01:42:06,178 --> 01:42:06,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding.

1351
01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:07,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course we got that for you.

1352
01:42:09,045 --> 01:42:10,226
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1353
01:42:10,426 --> 01:42:16,329
[SPEAKER_16]: You do cat sit for us and feed the kitties and give them pettings and drink our juice and eat our food.

1354
01:42:16,349 --> 01:42:16,929
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm just kidding.

1355
01:42:17,889 --> 01:42:18,590
[SPEAKER_16]: We do appreciate it.

1356
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:20,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Duffy.

1357
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:23,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So finally this time we said, let's just get her the damn real Duffy.

1358
01:42:23,572 --> 01:42:24,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just do it.

1359
01:42:24,192 --> 01:42:28,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Duffy hat and a Duffy purse and a teeny tiny Duffy.

1360
01:42:28,815 --> 01:42:31,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan said he would never buy me anything Duffy and he got me a keychain.

1361
01:42:32,176 --> 01:42:32,476
Did he?

1362
01:42:33,317 --> 01:42:34,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I have a real Duffy.

1363
01:42:34,918 --> 01:42:35,958
[SPEAKER_07]: He's so soft.

1364
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:37,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Dan's going to be thrilled.

1365
01:42:37,839 --> 01:42:39,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking a picture of him right now.

1366
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,780
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1367
01:42:41,521 --> 01:42:42,501
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope Dan's not listening.

1368
01:42:42,521 --> 01:42:43,141
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1369
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:44,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope he is.

1370
01:42:44,802 --> 01:42:48,344
[SPEAKER_16]: TigerClaw in chat says, Rob, you go to Disneyland so much, you will need to go to Disney World.

1371
01:42:48,424 --> 01:42:51,525
[SPEAKER_16]: After that, you should take it to the extreme and go to Euro Disney.

1372
01:42:52,306 --> 01:42:56,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I would actually love to, or it's Disneyland Paris now, by the way, but I would actually love to go to Disney World.

1373
01:42:57,008 --> 01:43:06,532
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, it's a little more expensive to go cross country and you have to go just the right time of year because I don't want it to be super crowded, but I don't want to get blown away by the hurricane either.

1374
01:43:06,872 --> 01:43:11,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I'm putting it up on the, uh, on the Orange Lounge picture thingy.

1375
01:43:11,278 --> 01:43:13,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Spazinator, that's not a Duffy beer.

1376
01:43:13,882 --> 01:43:14,783
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a Duffy bear.

1377
01:43:14,803 --> 01:43:15,584
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a big difference.

1378
01:43:16,245 --> 01:43:16,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1379
01:43:16,485 --> 01:43:23,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, the pictures going up on are, uh... Sorry, Loki, I know you really want a Duffy bear more than anything, but maybe next time.

1380
01:43:24,175 --> 01:43:25,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know what the fuck a Duffy bear is.

1381
01:43:25,957 --> 01:43:26,497
[SPEAKER_14]: It's this!

1382
01:43:26,577 --> 01:43:27,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I see that's a bear.

1383
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:29,080
[SPEAKER_14]: He's adorable!

1384
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:30,461
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know who he is.

1385
01:43:30,861 --> 01:43:32,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, his little feetsies have Mickey.

1386
01:43:32,163 --> 01:43:32,823
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm taking a picture.

1387
01:43:32,903 --> 01:43:34,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I was about to take a picture of his feet.

1388
01:43:34,745 --> 01:43:38,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Minnie made this for Mickey, so yeah, that's fantastic.

1389
01:43:40,035 --> 01:43:43,897
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just buying time for Alan to get that out for Jamie.

1390
01:43:44,698 --> 01:43:45,458
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's move on.

1391
01:43:45,498 --> 01:43:46,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

1392
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Get into some rapid fire news.

1393
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Alan, for doing that, by the way.

1394
01:43:51,162 --> 01:43:52,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Alan, for doing that.

1395
01:43:53,023 --> 01:43:54,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get back into some gaming news so I can eat some cake.

1396
01:43:55,345 --> 01:44:02,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so the game by Notch, Minicraft, it's the one that he created in 48 hours last year.

1397
01:44:02,671 --> 01:44:04,852
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been ported to Android devices.

1398
01:44:05,693 --> 01:44:12,719
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently it's not an official port of the game, but it's been done by a group called Fullstad Consulting.

1399
01:44:13,499 --> 01:44:16,682
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has touchscreen controls and all that fun stuff.

1400
01:44:16,722 --> 01:44:19,664
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently, I believe it's free from the Android Marketplace.

1401
01:44:19,744 --> 01:44:21,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So go check it out if you're interested in that.

1402
01:44:23,167 --> 01:44:23,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1403
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:30,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea why people would buy this, but there is a new device called the Retro 2.

1404
01:44:30,894 --> 01:44:36,517
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a USB device that allows you to play Super NES and Genesis games in emulators.

1405
01:44:38,138 --> 01:44:39,079
[SPEAKER_14]: The actual thing costs $85.

1406
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:46,801
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll allow you to plug in your controllers and whatnot into it and play it through an emulator.

1407
01:44:47,221 --> 01:44:49,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you could probably buy a real console for that price.

1408
01:44:50,862 --> 01:44:51,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Just saying.

1409
01:44:51,582 --> 01:44:56,263
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know why you would bother to try to play these through emulators.

1410
01:44:56,403 --> 01:45:00,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Just last week we were talking about flea markets and how some of the old systems still work.

1411
01:45:00,724 --> 01:45:02,685
[SPEAKER_16]: The Super Nintendo I have over there still works.

1412
01:45:03,565 --> 01:45:05,465
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, just go get the old console.

1413
01:45:05,505 --> 01:45:07,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, if you're going to spend $85 on something, you can...

1414
01:45:08,786 --> 01:45:10,268
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a text from Dan Duffy the focus group bear

1415
01:45:30,713 --> 01:45:31,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't know why.

1416
01:45:31,874 --> 01:45:34,034
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, if you're interested, you can check it out.

1417
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:37,416
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Retrode.com, I believe.

1418
01:45:37,616 --> 01:45:41,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, R-E-T-R-O-D-E, if you want to purchase that.

1419
01:45:42,397 --> 01:45:44,338
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, of course, Abobo.

1420
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,300
[SPEAKER_14]: You may remember him or not from the...

1421
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, now I can't remember the goddamn name.

1422
01:45:52,102 --> 01:45:52,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Double Dragon.

1423
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:59,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I was like Dragon Age, Dragon War, Dragon Twin, Dragon something.

1424
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:00,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it has dragon in it.

1425
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:02,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't Twin Dragons like a plane?

1426
01:46:02,472 --> 01:46:04,975
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's Twin Cobra and that was a helicopter game.

1427
01:46:05,015 --> 01:46:05,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1428
01:46:06,215 --> 01:46:15,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, so, uh, Aboa's Big Adventure is a free-to-play flash game, um, and of course features one of the characters from, uh, Double Dragon.

1429
01:46:15,504 --> 01:46:22,692
[SPEAKER_14]: This game reminds me a lot of, um, oh, what was the one that they did for, uh, there was another one.

1430
01:46:23,072 --> 01:46:23,793
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, um...

1431
01:46:25,534 --> 01:46:26,035
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember now.

1432
01:46:26,375 --> 01:46:28,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's this game actually that I'm thinking of.

1433
01:46:29,197 --> 01:46:39,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, the game will be coming out on January 11th and I guess it's confirmed on the official website of BubblesBigAdventure.com and you can play the game when it comes out.

1434
01:46:39,985 --> 01:46:45,830
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course it features a bunch of old NES settings and parodies so it should be fun.

1435
01:46:47,779 --> 01:46:49,681
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, moving on to some other rapid-fire news.

1436
01:46:50,342 --> 01:46:52,124
[SPEAKER_16]: You know I love this series, Kid Icarus.

1437
01:46:52,585 --> 01:46:56,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, there's the new Uprising game that's coming out, what, this quarter at some point, right?

1438
01:46:56,709 --> 01:46:57,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a firm date for that yet?

1439
01:46:57,951 --> 01:46:58,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's in March.

1440
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:00,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't remember what date.

1441
01:47:00,394 --> 01:47:01,295
[SPEAKER_16]: So at the end of this quarter.

1442
01:47:01,355 --> 01:47:04,058
[SPEAKER_16]: But in the meantime, you can play with some fan remakes.

1443
01:47:04,138 --> 01:47:07,442
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a fan remake out there called Super Kid Icarus.

1444
01:47:07,882 --> 01:47:32,597
[SPEAKER_16]: it's what they're calling a 16-bit remake um but that's a little bit deceptive because basically it's a pc version of Kid Icarus that uses 16-bit style sprites but very clearly a lot of the fonts and things that are used are pc but whatever you can play it in your emulator and it's basically Kid Icarus with souped up graphics and easy mode so if you uh you know Kid Icarus is kind of a fucking hard game so if you want to uh play it a little easier you can do that in this

1445
01:47:32,697 --> 01:47:33,718
[SPEAKER_16]: I did play a little bit of it.

1446
01:47:34,498 --> 01:47:36,960
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to see if there was more than just the first level in there.

1447
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And yes, I got all the way to the second level.

1448
01:47:38,641 --> 01:47:39,302
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

1449
01:47:40,863 --> 01:47:42,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Better play it now before Nintendo pulls it down.

1450
01:47:42,644 --> 01:47:43,245
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

1451
01:47:43,285 --> 01:47:45,326
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to do that now before they pull it down.

1452
01:47:45,707 --> 01:47:52,552
[SPEAKER_16]: This is interesting because the website that actually has it is home.comcast.net slash tilde super kid Icarus.

1453
01:47:53,032 --> 01:47:59,076
[SPEAKER_16]: So enjoy it now before it gets pulled because I'm sure Comcast will get that cease and desist from Nintendo any minute now.

1454
01:48:00,117 --> 01:48:01,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony of the Goddesses

1455
01:48:19,915 --> 01:48:22,296
[SPEAKER_16]: January 10th is the first show in Dallas, Texas.

1456
01:48:22,696 --> 01:48:24,076
[SPEAKER_16]: March 14th in Vancouver.

1457
01:48:24,176 --> 01:48:27,077
[SPEAKER_16]: March 26th in Seattle, San Francisco on March 28th.

1458
01:48:27,517 --> 01:48:28,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Denver on April 7th.

1459
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:31,319
[SPEAKER_16]: April 20th, 21st in Phoenix.

1460
01:48:31,699 --> 01:48:32,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Atlanta on May 12th.

1461
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:34,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Montreal on May 31st.

1462
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Austin on June 22nd.

1463
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:38,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Orlando on July 14th.

1464
01:48:38,401 --> 01:48:40,942
[SPEAKER_16]: And Toronto on September 29th.

1465
01:48:41,222 --> 01:48:44,083
[SPEAKER_16]: They are saying that there are more tour dates that are planned.

1466
01:48:44,423 --> 01:48:46,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Very interesting what's not on the list.

1467
01:48:46,924 --> 01:48:47,384
[SPEAKER_16]: SoCal.

1468
01:48:48,124 --> 01:49:04,117
[SPEAKER_16]: so it's interesting to see maybe they'll do an LA show possibly an LA show like around E3 who knows but yeah they're going to be playing music from all the different Zelda games so it's not just the new one so if you like live symphony I think you'll enjoy that

1469
01:49:04,717 --> 01:49:09,261
[SPEAKER_16]: God of War 4 apparently has been spotted on a composer's resume.

1470
01:49:10,362 --> 01:49:13,124
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the first bit of anything God of War 4 that we've seen.

1471
01:49:13,164 --> 01:49:17,187
[SPEAKER_16]: It was on the resume of Timothy Williams, who is the God of War series composer.

1472
01:49:17,547 --> 01:49:23,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently it's on his resume, but really, is it any fucking surprise that God of War 4 is in the making?

1473
01:49:24,552 --> 01:49:25,233
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't think so.

1474
01:49:25,293 --> 01:49:26,074
[SPEAKER_16]: God of 4.

1475
01:49:26,234 --> 01:49:26,854
[SPEAKER_16]: God of 4.

1476
01:49:29,096 --> 01:49:31,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's what they should actually call it.

1477
01:49:31,758 --> 01:49:32,218
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

1478
01:49:32,258 --> 01:49:32,739
[SPEAKER_16]: God of 4.

1479
01:49:33,299 --> 01:49:34,200
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Dark Sakura.

1480
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,421
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1481
01:50:03,464 --> 01:50:15,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, this is specifically new characters leaked for Street Fighter across Tekken, and that is Shalyu and M. Bison, or as he is known overseas, Balrog.

1482
01:50:17,153 --> 01:50:19,294
[SPEAKER_07]: or Vega, sorry, Vega, because they switched them around.

1483
01:50:19,734 --> 01:50:22,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Balrog is the Vega over here, whatever.

1484
01:50:23,955 --> 01:50:24,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, I've gone cross-eyed.

1485
01:50:25,735 --> 01:50:29,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Xiaolu and M. Bison are involved.

1486
01:50:30,357 --> 01:50:36,218
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as rock band news, it's Rob's absolute favorite band ever, Hall & Oates.

1487
01:50:37,739 --> 01:50:38,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Kidding.

1488
01:50:38,459 --> 01:50:42,320
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, ABBA has an exclusive thing with the SingStar franchise, so it can't be that.

1489
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:46,370
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Holland Oats Pack 01, which has Private Eyes.

1490
01:50:46,571 --> 01:50:47,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't go for that.

1491
01:50:47,654 --> 01:50:48,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And Maneater.

1492
01:50:48,456 --> 01:50:49,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I would get Maneater.

1493
01:50:49,739 --> 01:50:50,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Private Eyes is awesome.

1494
01:50:52,216 --> 01:50:52,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want this now.

1495
01:50:52,916 --> 01:50:55,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Private Eyes is awesome and actually Maneater is pretty awesome too.

1496
01:50:55,918 --> 01:51:05,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I think of Paula Notes, I think of Patton Oswalt talking about if they had those surgery shows back in the 80s, people would want to look like Paula Notes.

1497
01:51:07,905 --> 01:51:09,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to look like Steve Guttenberg.

1498
01:51:10,166 --> 01:51:12,107
[SPEAKER_16]: I like what Spazinator suggests in chat here.

1499
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:13,048
[SPEAKER_16]: God of Gwar.

1500
01:51:13,328 --> 01:51:14,189
[SPEAKER_16]: God of Gwar!

1501
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:16,510
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be awesome.

1502
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:18,431
[SPEAKER_16]: They should have a Gwar mod for God of War.

1503
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:20,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't they have Gwar songs in Rock Band?

1504
01:51:20,693 --> 01:51:22,214
[SPEAKER_16]: They've got to have something.

1505
01:51:22,234 --> 01:51:22,934
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

1506
01:51:22,954 --> 01:51:23,554
[SPEAKER_16]: There I am.

1507
01:51:24,075 --> 01:51:29,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last, but not least, House of the Dead 3 and 4 are both coming to PSN.

1508
01:51:30,078 --> 01:51:32,140
[SPEAKER_16]: But no typing of the dead, so therefore failure.

1509
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:32,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

1510
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two copies of Typing of the Dead.

1511
01:51:34,893 --> 01:51:38,795
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know where the fuck my Dreamcast keyboard is if I even have one anymore.

1512
01:51:38,815 --> 01:51:40,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the Dreamcast version and the PC version.

1513
01:51:40,476 --> 01:51:41,757
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to have Typing of the Dead day.

1514
01:51:42,337 --> 01:51:43,198
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what we need to do?

1515
01:51:43,378 --> 01:51:45,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Mavis Beacon ain't got shit on Typing of the Dead.

1516
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,740
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what we need to do?

1517
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,120
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1518
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,382
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get Jessica, Iguana Girl.

1519
01:51:50,402 --> 01:51:51,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, she was really good at that, wasn't she?

1520
01:51:52,043 --> 01:51:53,884
[SPEAKER_07]: and we need to have a Typing of the Dead-a-thon.

1521
01:51:53,904 --> 01:51:58,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when I got my copy, I took it to her apartment.

1522
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:00,986
[SPEAKER_07]: The apartment that she was living in when I met her.

1523
01:52:01,806 --> 01:52:04,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And we played Typing of the Dead for like three hours.

1524
01:52:04,947 --> 01:52:06,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet I know what apartment that was.

1525
01:52:06,728 --> 01:52:07,428
[SPEAKER_16]: She lived there forever.

1526
01:52:07,468 --> 01:52:09,209
[SPEAKER_07]: The one with several exits.

1527
01:52:09,249 --> 01:52:09,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes.

1528
01:52:09,949 --> 01:52:10,749
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember that one.

1529
01:52:11,409 --> 01:52:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: But the one that I stayed up for three days without sleep making a costume with Evan.

1530
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:18,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, anyway.

1531
01:52:18,541 --> 01:52:18,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1532
01:52:19,601 --> 01:52:27,043
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, House of the Dead 3 came out in 2002, and House of the Dead 4 has only been in the arcade, so this is an exclusive to PSN.

1533
01:52:27,363 --> 01:52:27,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.

1534
01:52:28,023 --> 01:52:29,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, how about the Silent Hill game?

1535
01:52:29,384 --> 01:52:35,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I know a different company, but that Silent Hill arcade game, seriously, why haven't we seen this released somewhere for the home?

1536
01:52:35,485 --> 01:52:37,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they have a stick up their ass.

1537
01:52:38,106 --> 01:52:38,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, oh, okay.

1538
01:52:38,906 --> 01:52:39,726
[SPEAKER_16]: That answers everything.

1539
01:52:39,926 --> 01:52:46,408
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're currently stuck on it, and the moment that they learn how to stand up without taking the stick up their ass with them...

1540
01:52:47,088 --> 01:52:47,989
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll probably see it.

1541
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:52,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having to hide poor Duffy's virgin Disney ears.

1542
01:52:53,655 --> 01:52:56,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it too much to ask for some... Duffy, come over here.

1543
01:52:56,478 --> 01:53:02,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it too much to ask for some fucking Silent Hill arcade game?

1544
01:53:02,925 --> 01:53:04,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely the Disney bear.

1545
01:53:04,766 --> 01:53:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that Rob has a potty mouth and he should eat some soap.

1546
01:53:08,369 --> 01:53:08,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, God.

1547
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:11,991
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just like Lil Santorum on Horde House this week.

1548
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:14,112
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not even going to explain it.

1549
01:53:14,152 --> 01:53:14,392
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1550
01:53:15,093 --> 01:53:16,294
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not even going to explain it.

1551
01:53:16,454 --> 01:53:17,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Horde House dot com.

1552
01:53:17,394 --> 01:53:18,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Lil Santorum.

1553
01:53:18,175 --> 01:53:18,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's.

1554
01:53:18,795 --> 01:53:19,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just imagine.

1555
01:53:19,696 --> 01:53:22,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Rick Santorum and I'm an asshole.

1556
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,100
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, look.

1557
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:27,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1558
01:53:29,637 --> 01:53:31,618
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, that was an authentic southern accent.

1559
01:53:32,658 --> 01:53:33,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, was it?

1560
01:53:34,919 --> 01:53:35,379
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't tell.

1561
01:53:35,539 --> 01:53:37,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that DarkSakura or is it George Bush?

1562
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:37,900
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

1563
01:53:39,701 --> 01:53:40,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on.

1564
01:53:41,702 --> 01:53:45,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, maybe you can bring some video game news back into this program that used to be about gaming.

1565
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about piracy.

1566
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, whatever, I'll take what I can get.

1567
01:53:50,572 --> 01:53:55,356
[SPEAKER_14]: So, of course, a report came out talking about the most pirated games of 2011.

1568
01:53:55,516 --> 01:53:57,258
[SPEAKER_14]: This is coming from Torrent Freak.

1569
01:53:57,318 --> 01:53:59,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I would think that they would know a little bit about piracy.

1570
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:06,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, now, Loki, Torrent Freak isn't... It's just a BitTorrent news site.

1571
01:54:07,065 --> 01:54:08,066
[SPEAKER_14]: How dare you?

1572
01:54:08,086 --> 01:54:12,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they should still be up to date with what's going on, including piracy.

1573
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:13,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, come on.

1574
01:54:14,091 --> 01:54:18,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not suggesting that they are pirating themselves or facilitating pirating in any way.

1575
01:54:19,536 --> 01:54:22,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I am just saying that they should know something about it.

1576
01:54:22,959 --> 01:54:29,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, the number one game that has been downloaded 3.9 million times since its release in March of 2011

1577
01:54:33,852 --> 01:54:37,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Crisis 2, the sequel to the game that killed PCs around the world.

1578
01:54:39,335 --> 01:54:41,457
[SPEAKER_14]: But yes, Crisis 2, number one game.

1579
01:54:42,137 --> 01:54:48,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, Modern Warfare 3 was downloaded an estimated 3.6 million times since November.

1580
01:54:49,442 --> 01:54:52,925
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, if Modern Warfare 3 had come out in March, then it would probably have been number one.

1581
01:54:56,850 --> 01:55:04,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Battlefield 3 coming in 3rd with 3.5 million downloads and of course, rounding out the top 5, FIFA 12 and Portal 2.

1582
01:55:06,901 --> 01:55:07,322
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

1583
01:55:08,463 --> 01:55:10,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Surprised what's not on the list maybe?

1584
01:55:10,746 --> 01:55:11,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything?

1585
01:55:13,778 --> 01:55:15,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that was all PC stuff.

1586
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk a little bit about... How about Xenoblade?

1587
01:55:19,523 --> 01:55:23,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Well... I'm surprised more people didn't pirate that to be able to play it in the US.

1588
01:55:23,086 --> 01:55:25,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, now, you spoke too soon.

1589
01:55:26,349 --> 01:55:32,675
[SPEAKER_14]: The top Wii game downloads on BitTorrent in 2011, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Mario Sports...

1590
01:55:33,055 --> 01:55:33,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Mix.

1591
01:55:33,395 --> 01:55:35,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Why the fuck would people download Mario Sports Mix?

1592
01:55:35,456 --> 01:55:35,956
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a terrible game.

1593
01:55:35,976 --> 01:55:36,917
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a very good question.

1594
01:55:36,997 --> 01:55:39,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I get Galaxy 2 because that was on a lot of the best list.

1595
01:55:40,098 --> 01:55:42,339
[SPEAKER_14]: And Xenoblade Chronicles was number three.

1596
01:55:42,459 --> 01:55:44,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, number four.

1597
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And FIFA 12, number five.

1598
01:55:46,401 --> 01:55:47,642
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a weird list.

1599
01:55:47,922 --> 01:55:48,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1600
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Xbox 360 downloads.

1601
01:55:51,063 --> 01:55:52,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Gears of War 3, number one.

1602
01:55:52,404 --> 01:55:54,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Call of Duty Mario Warfare 3, number two.

1603
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:56,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Battlefield 3, number three.

1604
01:55:56,666 --> 01:55:58,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Forza Motorsports 4, number four.

1605
01:55:58,947 --> 01:56:01,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And Kinect Sports Season 2, number five.

1606
01:56:01,847 --> 01:56:02,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

1607
01:56:27,156 --> 01:56:31,977
[SPEAKER_16]: StarCraft 2, big PC game, nowhere on that list, I think, because of the whole Battle.net tie-in.

1608
01:56:32,618 --> 01:56:38,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, that drives a lot of people bonkers because they don't want to be on the internet to play the game, so where's the happy middle ground?

1609
01:56:38,539 --> 01:56:38,879
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1610
01:56:39,879 --> 01:56:45,081
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, anyhow, moving on to a system that I'm sure nobody's going to pirate any games on at all, the Wii U.

1611
01:56:47,473 --> 01:56:53,080
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a new rumor about the Wii U, because rumors about the Wii U are everywhere, and it's a slow news week, so why the hell not?

1612
01:56:53,501 --> 01:56:58,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, Wii U will also double as an e-reader.

1613
01:56:58,767 --> 01:57:04,914
[SPEAKER_16]: This is apparently via a friend who Nintendo approached to do iOS software ports for.

1614
01:57:05,254 --> 01:57:19,564
[SPEAKER_16]: over to the Wii U system, which doesn't surprise me at all that the Wii U would probably be going after things like Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Tiny Tower, the stuff that's really big on iOS to be able to be played on the touch device.

1615
01:57:19,644 --> 01:57:20,644
[SPEAKER_16]: That wouldn't surprise me at all.

1616
01:57:21,805 --> 01:57:29,170
[SPEAKER_16]: But apparently Nintendo is also looking at doing digital books, magazines, comics, and so forth on the Wii U and the 3DS.

1617
01:57:29,791 --> 01:57:34,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently instruction manuals could be done this way too, strategy guides, and Nintendo Power.

1618
01:57:35,936 --> 01:57:44,510
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what would be really funny, but there's no way this is ever going to happen, is if the Wii U controller actually became its own console.

1619
01:57:45,933 --> 01:57:46,653
[SPEAKER_16]: But it can't.

1620
01:57:46,933 --> 01:57:49,054
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, because all the processing is done on that base.

1621
01:57:49,074 --> 01:57:49,834
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that.

1622
01:57:50,174 --> 01:57:53,475
[SPEAKER_14]: They could put an ARM processor in there and have its own tablet.

1623
01:57:53,535 --> 01:57:55,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm kind of deja vu-ing what we talked about a little bit last week.

1624
01:57:55,856 --> 01:58:07,079
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, we talked about how maybe one of the big things that they're going to change, because the system could change a lot until next E3, is that maybe they're going to put its own processor, a littler processor, in the Wii U controller itself.

1625
01:58:07,779 --> 01:58:12,160
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to drive the price of those things up even more, but... Processors are cheap, really.

1626
01:58:12,856 --> 01:58:13,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I guess it's true.

1627
01:58:13,877 --> 01:58:15,117
[SPEAKER_16]: It just depends on what they put in there.

1628
01:58:17,839 --> 01:58:20,740
[SPEAKER_16]: DDRDollarBill in our chatroom says, Wii U trying to be a tablet?

1629
01:58:21,441 --> 01:58:21,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1630
01:58:22,521 --> 01:58:23,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Tablets are terrible!

1631
01:58:24,022 --> 01:58:25,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's build a tablet, come on.

1632
01:58:25,743 --> 01:58:26,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, here's the thing, though.

1633
01:58:26,724 --> 01:58:31,006
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a lot of it would be the fact that Nintendo would have a big audience with kids.

1634
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:34,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, maybe kids are too young to have their own iPad?

1635
01:58:35,428 --> 01:58:35,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob?

1636
01:58:35,949 --> 01:58:36,169
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1637
01:58:36,409 --> 01:58:37,750
[SPEAKER_07]: How well did the Pico do, really?

1638
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:41,391
[SPEAKER_16]: But kids could use the Wii U controller.

1639
01:58:41,431 --> 01:58:42,432
[SPEAKER_14]: See, that's the thing, though.

1640
01:58:42,552 --> 01:58:44,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think kids are too young to have an iPad.

1641
01:58:44,753 --> 01:58:45,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me put it this way.

1642
01:58:46,074 --> 01:58:51,336
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of parents don't think kids are too young to have an iPad, and they will buy them an iPad or an iPod or something.

1643
01:58:51,376 --> 01:58:58,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I remember seeing on some gaming blogs the stupid iPod touch freak out Christmas videos and stuff like that.

1644
01:58:58,960 --> 01:58:59,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, come on.

1645
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Parents are willing to buy their kids that kind of stuff.

1646
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:03,662
[SPEAKER_07]: There are cat games on iPad.

1647
01:59:04,382 --> 01:59:10,408
[SPEAKER_14]: There's games for toddlers on the iPad, so I'm not surprised that they would do that.

1648
01:59:10,468 --> 01:59:17,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, with an iPad 3 coming out probably soon, it's only going to drive the prices of the older models down.

1649
01:59:18,374 --> 01:59:22,138
[SPEAKER_14]: So why wouldn't parents buy an iPad?

1650
01:59:22,338 --> 01:59:29,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised parents would let their kids play with an iPad because people are letting their frogs and lizards play with their iPad.

1651
01:59:29,564 --> 01:59:30,585
[SPEAKER_07]: That Ant Smasher game?

1652
01:59:30,805 --> 01:59:31,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, people are dumb.

1653
01:59:31,986 --> 01:59:33,628
[SPEAKER_16]: It is kind of amusing.

1654
01:59:33,668 --> 01:59:39,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, as long as the Wii U gets swap note, that's all I care about.

1655
01:59:39,653 --> 01:59:43,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Which, by the way, if you could smile big, because I'm going to take a picture for Bobby here.

1656
01:59:43,537 --> 01:59:44,277
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not smiling big.

1657
01:59:44,337 --> 01:59:46,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'll send it to Tigerclaw 2 there.

1658
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:48,241
[SPEAKER_16]: A little 3D picture there of all our life.

1659
01:59:48,301 --> 01:59:48,541
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1660
01:59:50,632 --> 01:59:51,213
[SPEAKER_06]: with Duffy.

1661
01:59:52,635 --> 01:59:54,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Duffy makes every photo adorable.

1662
01:59:55,618 --> 01:59:57,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Swapnote is actually pretty cool.

1663
01:59:58,882 --> 02:00:02,447
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like Nintendo is finally understanding email.

1664
02:00:03,482 --> 02:00:04,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Fantastic, Nintendo.

1665
02:00:28,756 --> 02:00:34,082
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, I'm putting a picture of Duffy's butt on the OLR thing.

1666
02:00:34,903 --> 02:00:39,127
[SPEAKER_16]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com Alright, let's take a moment to visit the mailbag.

1667
02:00:39,267 --> 02:00:40,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1668
02:00:42,273 --> 02:00:48,700
[SPEAKER_16]: mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag and reads her favorite emails.

1669
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:52,744
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say we should start taking emails over SwapNote but you'd have to have my friend code to do that.

1670
02:00:53,064 --> 02:00:54,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Duffy should start reading them.

1671
02:00:55,727 --> 02:00:56,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Duffy.

1672
02:00:56,728 --> 02:00:58,089
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Duffy should not read them.

1673
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:04,073
[SPEAKER_16]: While I work on my swap note, I'm going to send a swap note to Bobby, and I guess I'll send it to Tigerclaw.

1674
02:01:04,214 --> 02:01:07,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know who else listens to OLR on my friends list, but I'll send it to them too.

1675
02:01:07,136 --> 02:01:13,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I wanted to announce that we do have three winners for the Master System Contest.

1676
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:13,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Wieners?

1677
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:14,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Wieners.

1678
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:19,264
[SPEAKER_07]: That means I have to do... I think I've got games enough to divide amongst them as well.

1679
02:01:20,625 --> 02:01:22,266
[SPEAKER_07]: So one is from Will...

1680
02:01:23,887 --> 02:01:27,189
[SPEAKER_07]: and I will be logging into the email when I get home.

1681
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:32,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one is... Where is it?

1682
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:36,254
[SPEAKER_07]: From Rico.

1683
02:01:37,335 --> 02:01:38,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of them was Hitstun.

1684
02:01:39,896 --> 02:01:43,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So, congratulations to our winners.

1685
02:01:43,698 --> 02:01:44,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Congrats to all you wieners.

1686
02:01:45,635 --> 02:01:48,701
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm going to try to send you ones that you don't already have.

1687
02:01:48,881 --> 02:01:52,288
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know who's about getting what.

1688
02:01:52,328 --> 02:01:55,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you get a duplicate, sorry, eBay.

1689
02:01:56,596 --> 02:01:58,079
[SPEAKER_07]: We can autograph them though if you want us to.

1690
02:01:59,545 --> 02:02:01,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So back to the mailbag.

1691
02:02:02,687 --> 02:02:05,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I just played the worst game in history of Nintendo DS.

1692
02:02:06,490 --> 02:02:10,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked for it for Christmas because I love puss in boots and a sexy Antonio voice.

1693
02:02:11,153 --> 02:02:17,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, unfortunately, the reviews I were looking at were for the Wii version of the game, which apparently is decent.

1694
02:02:17,637 --> 02:02:20,819
[SPEAKER_07]: This, however, this abomination should never have been made.

1695
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:24,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It is surely the spawn of Satan and all copies should be destroyed.

1696
02:02:25,322 --> 02:02:34,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, the graphics look like something back from early, early PlayStation 1 or Nintendo 64 back when their characters, they were made of Lego blocks.

1697
02:02:34,669 --> 02:02:37,711
[SPEAKER_07]: No voices, and the gameplay, tap the screen to the beat.

1698
02:02:37,972 --> 02:02:39,673
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, that's the whole stupid game.

1699
02:02:40,574 --> 02:02:46,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I get for buying a tie-in game, I guess, but I really thought they'd treat puss with some respect.

1700
02:02:46,718 --> 02:02:47,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad face.

1701
02:02:47,619 --> 02:02:52,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Holly D. Haven't we warned you about tie-ins?

1702
02:02:53,484 --> 02:02:55,791
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right, game tie-ins can be pretty bad.

1703
02:02:56,473 --> 02:02:59,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Or movie tie-ins, games can be pretty bad.

1704
02:03:00,484 --> 02:03:01,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email.

1705
02:03:01,547 --> 02:03:01,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Bummer, though.

1706
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:03,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, OLR crew.

1707
02:03:04,111 --> 02:03:05,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen The Tester on PSN.

1708
02:03:06,092 --> 02:03:09,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the first season or the second, mostly because I'm over reality shows.

1709
02:03:09,755 --> 02:03:14,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I also thought the grand prize of being an entry-level tester was kind of stupid, though a great way for you to get your foot in the door.

1710
02:03:15,399 --> 02:03:20,023
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think I'm going to start watching the new season because I just found out a friend of a friend is a contestant.

1711
02:03:20,523 --> 02:03:26,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We were chatting on Facebook and I asked her if she'd be interested in appearing as a guest on OLR, but only if you're interested.

1712
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:33,570
[SPEAKER_07]: She seemed very interested, but would have to get back to me to see if corporate folks would allow her to do so.

1713
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:35,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question is, would you be interested?

1714
02:03:37,411 --> 02:03:38,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Why the hell not?

1715
02:03:38,132 --> 02:03:40,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, I want to know who beat DarkSakura for the position.

1716
02:03:40,912 --> 02:03:43,573
[SPEAKER_07]: No, DarkSakura withdrew herself.

1717
02:03:43,633 --> 02:03:48,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to give any more of her information, just because it's included in the email.

1718
02:03:48,715 --> 02:03:49,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure.

1719
02:03:49,455 --> 02:03:50,155
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are interested.

1720
02:03:50,756 --> 02:03:51,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, why not?

1721
02:03:51,856 --> 02:03:54,357
[SPEAKER_07]: If corporate PSN will let us, then we're happy for it.

1722
02:03:55,157 --> 02:03:57,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I would love to ask some questions about this stuff.

1723
02:03:57,879 --> 02:04:02,061
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to wait until the show debuts, though, so we can be like, okay, how bad did they misrepresent this?

1724
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:06,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there is at least one person that's a somewhat internet celebrity that's actually in there.

1725
02:04:07,484 --> 02:04:07,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, really?

1726
02:04:07,944 --> 02:04:13,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the guy that does, I don't know if you've ever seen them, the awesome games, like Metal Gear Awesome.

1727
02:04:13,807 --> 02:04:16,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, those are great.

1728
02:04:16,669 --> 02:04:20,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he's actually in contention there.

1729
02:04:21,371 --> 02:04:22,051
[SPEAKER_14]: That's funny.

1730
02:04:22,712 --> 02:04:25,372
[SPEAKER_14]: So, rooting for him, because he's the only person I recognize.

1731
02:04:25,832 --> 02:04:26,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Vaguely.

1732
02:04:26,973 --> 02:04:31,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it says, thanks and keep up the good work, and thanks for putting the podcast up on Mondays.

1733
02:04:31,074 --> 02:04:32,214
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not so blah anymore.

1734
02:04:32,534 --> 02:04:33,254
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from Stan.

1735
02:04:33,434 --> 02:04:35,515
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the show up within an hour last week.

1736
02:04:35,715 --> 02:04:36,955
[SPEAKER_16]: This is great having it at my house.

1737
02:04:37,315 --> 02:04:38,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for you.

1738
02:04:38,456 --> 02:04:38,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Just saying.

1739
02:04:39,836 --> 02:04:44,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, by the way, I sent that message on SwapNote.

1740
02:04:44,878 --> 02:04:46,338
[SPEAKER_16]: See how long it takes to get to Tigercola.

1741
02:04:48,485 --> 02:04:51,123
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good evening, DarkSakura, Sky, and LokiSaurus.

1742
02:04:52,754 --> 02:04:54,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I am writing to you from a pseudo-email account.

1743
02:04:54,996 --> 02:04:57,238
[SPEAKER_07]: For our conversation, you can call me Traxler.

1744
02:04:57,678 --> 02:04:58,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a long-time listener.

1745
02:04:58,779 --> 02:04:59,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is my plight.

1746
02:05:00,721 --> 02:05:03,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a 34-year-old male gamer living in Northwest Florida.

1747
02:05:04,244 --> 02:05:09,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I play everything from Batman Arkham City on Xbox to SWTOR and WoW on PC.

1748
02:05:10,309 --> 02:05:13,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I make a decent income from working full-time technical job in a network operations center.

1749
02:05:14,693 --> 02:05:19,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I am suffering probably from maybe a newer condition called gamer's loneliness or gamer's depression.

1750
02:05:20,798 --> 02:05:44,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I am an okay looking guy, average weight and height, I have money and a car I'm having problems finding a companion, I like women so I'm not alone I've tried POF, OkCupid, Geek2Geek with no success I think it might be my age and the single gamer women are ultra rare Maybe the fact that I don't drink or go to clubs slash bars I do know my schedule is bad, I work Friday to Monday 12 hour shifts with a 2 hour commute to work each day But it's my job

1751
02:05:44,958 --> 02:05:45,638
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1752
02:06:05,948 --> 02:06:07,129
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is married, however.

1753
02:06:24,286 --> 02:06:29,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to let you all know this information because there could be other gamers out there that could be feeling the way I feel.

1754
02:06:30,031 --> 02:06:34,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if this is just how the world balances us gamers out of future equations.

1755
02:06:34,314 --> 02:06:35,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Reduce population.

1756
02:06:35,475 --> 02:06:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Your loyal listener, Traxler.

1757
02:06:37,017 --> 02:06:39,359
[SPEAKER_07]: This message is brought to you by Shermie Skylander Emporium.

1758
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:41,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow!

1759
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:41,801
[SPEAKER_16]: DB Mail.

1760
02:06:41,981 --> 02:06:42,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1761
02:06:44,663 --> 02:06:46,705
[SPEAKER_16]: That threw me for a little bit of a curveball.

1762
02:06:47,485 --> 02:06:47,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I...

1763
02:06:49,221 --> 02:07:16,493
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's one of those things where when you kind of let it go that you kind of have all that hanging over your head like oh my god I need this perfect life and I need this companion and I need I need all this to happen ABC to happen so I can be happy no no no you have to learn to be happy with what you've got and you're kind of like your current situation and then once you kind of have that about you that that confidence the rest of it will come I think I think

1764
02:07:16,921 --> 02:07:19,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I always say it happens when you stop trying to force it.

1765
02:07:20,245 --> 02:07:25,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, I also say things happen when you make them happen, but that's like stuff that you have tangible control over.

1766
02:07:26,351 --> 02:07:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like, I can't do this, well then go to school and learn how to do it.

1767
02:07:32,237 --> 02:07:33,018
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that type of thing.

1768
02:07:33,619 --> 02:07:34,720
[SPEAKER_07]: In this case, you know...

1769
02:07:36,644 --> 02:07:42,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Like with, and I know I've told this story a million times, but Dan and I hooked up, is that we had just been friends.

1770
02:07:43,008 --> 02:07:44,669
[SPEAKER_07]: We weren't trying to do anything.

1771
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:51,193
[SPEAKER_07]: And he just called me to cheer me up and we kept talking because it worked.

1772
02:07:51,833 --> 02:07:53,595
[SPEAKER_07]: And I moved out here and we worked.

1773
02:07:54,455 --> 02:07:59,378
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's just, that's like a really rare success story on top of that.

1774
02:08:00,018 --> 02:08:02,320
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was just sort of a faded thing, I guess.

1775
02:08:03,908 --> 02:08:10,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think that a good relationship will find you when you're not looking for one.

1776
02:08:11,806 --> 02:08:12,448
[SPEAKER_07]: If that makes sense.

1777
02:08:13,717 --> 02:08:18,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Alan and I were friends online for probably four or five years via LiveJournal.

1778
02:08:18,501 --> 02:08:20,662
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure he thought I was attractive.

1779
02:08:20,682 --> 02:08:21,423
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought he was attractive.

1780
02:08:21,463 --> 02:08:22,964
[SPEAKER_16]: It was kind of like, he lives in San Francisco.

1781
02:08:22,984 --> 02:08:24,865
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like he lives in China, so far away.

1782
02:08:25,486 --> 02:08:31,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And we never really gave it any thought until one day it just kind of, let's go out sometime.

1783
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:32,250
[SPEAKER_16]: And we did.

1784
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:35,152
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it was kind of like, well, we're going to make this work.

1785
02:08:35,192 --> 02:08:35,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And we did.

1786
02:08:35,693 --> 02:08:37,594
[SPEAKER_16]: So it just happened.

1787
02:08:37,694 --> 02:08:39,596
[SPEAKER_16]: I never thought it would, and it did.

1788
02:08:39,776 --> 02:08:39,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1789
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:44,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Although somewhere in the back of my imagination, I imagine Nelly going after Loki with a club.

1790
02:08:46,578 --> 02:08:47,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that what happens actually?

1791
02:08:47,518 --> 02:08:48,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Like a cave girl.

1792
02:08:48,979 --> 02:08:49,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Eh, no.

1793
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:54,881
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, for real, like, I wouldn't, like, just don't stress about it.

1794
02:08:54,961 --> 02:08:57,982
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, that's, you're only gonna cause yourself, like, hurt to do that.

1795
02:08:58,562 --> 02:09:27,758
[SPEAKER_16]: and I don't think you need to go out to bars or clubs I think you're doing the right thing just kind of put yourself out there online I would say if you really feel like you need to go out and do something try maybe like I know this sounds really weird but try like joining a club or maybe there's a non-profit in your area a political cause you can get behind a volunteer you know something where you force yourself to get out of the house well when I lived in Alabama and keep in mind this is when I was effectively single you know I did a lot of stuff I LARPed

1796
02:09:28,436 --> 02:09:30,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I played live-action vampires.

1797
02:09:30,238 --> 02:09:30,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1798
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:32,920
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing else to do in Alabama.

1799
02:09:34,341 --> 02:09:35,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in band.

1800
02:09:36,203 --> 02:09:37,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I did jazz band.

1801
02:09:38,005 --> 02:09:38,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in orchestra.

1802
02:09:39,646 --> 02:09:41,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because I was still a big band nerd.

1803
02:09:42,529 --> 02:09:45,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I would do ensembles with other friends.

1804
02:09:46,072 --> 02:09:47,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I played D&D.

1805
02:09:47,513 --> 02:09:50,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, that was when I was in eight games a week for a while.

1806
02:09:52,449 --> 02:09:54,529
[SPEAKER_07]: and I did... There was even... I gamed every night.

1807
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:55,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Every night.

1808
02:09:55,450 --> 02:09:56,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in different gaming groups.

1809
02:09:57,190 --> 02:10:01,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean... And I even dated a couple of people that I gamed with.

1810
02:10:01,931 --> 02:10:16,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, there was one guy who I was really into for a while but we just kind of never... Sort of fun to make out with and, you know... Fun to make out with, good friend, you know, never... That's exactly the type of people I met doing Rocky Horror for so many years.

1811
02:10:16,914 --> 02:10:18,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1812
02:10:18,174 --> 02:10:19,315
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost the same kind of thing.

1813
02:10:19,415 --> 02:10:20,755
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, you know, if...

1814
02:10:22,215 --> 02:10:47,351
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're making yourself into some kind of hermit I mean you're not going to meet anybody unless you find ways to branch out you have to make it yourself and so okay so clubs aren't your deal you know what I hate clubs too I sometimes go just because I like booze and I like goth music so I'll go hang out but I don't you know go because I'm well then again I didn't really start clubbing until I moved out here at all

1815
02:10:48,209 --> 02:10:55,538
[SPEAKER_07]: But if that's not your thing, then find, you know, I've made friends through my temple, for example, after I converted.

1816
02:10:55,638 --> 02:10:58,802
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if you're religious or anything, but, you know, there's always groups.

1817
02:10:58,822 --> 02:11:01,025
[SPEAKER_16]: That is something you can do with like-minded people, you know.

1818
02:11:01,165 --> 02:11:06,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, if, check out, actually check out YMCA.

1819
02:11:06,151 --> 02:11:06,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1820
02:11:07,748 --> 02:11:08,870
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1821
02:11:23,993 --> 02:11:28,535
[SPEAKER_16]: And coming back to this point, because I think this is very important, I think the first thing you have to do, and then we'll stop the advice show, I promise.

1822
02:11:29,076 --> 02:11:32,178
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think the first thing you have to do is you have to really sit down and say, I have a good life.

1823
02:11:32,698 --> 02:11:34,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you do have a job.

1824
02:11:35,079 --> 02:11:35,399
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't.

1825
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:40,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, but you have a lot of stuff that's going for you right now.

1826
02:11:41,723 --> 02:12:08,406
[SPEAKER_16]: you have the things that you're proud of and I don't know this person so it's hard for me to say whatever they are into but there's probably a lot and the person even says his email I consider myself good looking you have a lot going for you then so love yourself find the stuff that makes you happy and focus on that if the games aren't doing it for you anymore then there's another gap distract yourself

1827
02:12:09,267 --> 02:12:13,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not saying distract yourself in a don't work on the problem kind of way.

1828
02:12:14,289 --> 02:12:14,469
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1829
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:15,610
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1830
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:16,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Reading chat.

1831
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:21,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was going to say, you know, find new things.

1832
02:12:22,333 --> 02:12:25,774
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if your current hobby is not doing it for you, find a new hobby.

1833
02:12:26,715 --> 02:12:29,416
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to be out there is the thing.

1834
02:12:29,536 --> 02:12:32,077
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to try to meet somebody, you have to be out there and not be a hermit.

1835
02:12:32,998 --> 02:12:34,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, what would be your dating advice?

1836
02:12:34,318 --> 02:12:36,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have dating advice.

1837
02:12:36,419 --> 02:12:37,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to give you any of that.

1838
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:43,779
[SPEAKER_14]: My advice is, hey, you're going to have a lot of... Hookers.

1839
02:12:43,999 --> 02:12:44,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of hookers.

1840
02:12:44,619 --> 02:12:49,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes it's actually nice to have a lot of free time to play the games you want to play because you're not going to have that much.

1841
02:12:49,581 --> 02:12:51,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Because once you have a baby, that all goes away.

1842
02:12:52,022 --> 02:12:52,942
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all gone.

1843
02:12:52,962 --> 02:12:55,303
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good advice.

1844
02:12:55,703 --> 02:12:56,083
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1845
02:12:56,163 --> 02:12:58,284
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's another way to look at it.

1846
02:12:58,364 --> 02:13:00,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying hate on kids or whatever.

1847
02:13:01,446 --> 02:13:03,306
[SPEAKER_16]: But enjoy the life you have while you have it.

1848
02:13:04,827 --> 02:13:05,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

1849
02:13:05,839 --> 02:13:06,479
[SPEAKER_14]: So, there you go.

1850
02:13:06,519 --> 02:13:06,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1851
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:09,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, sometimes, you know, yeah, it's just like, you know.

1852
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:14,743
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if you want to incorporate sex life and your video gaming, you could try J-List because they have lots of imports.

1853
02:13:15,463 --> 02:13:19,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, it's just, go to cons.

1854
02:13:21,305 --> 02:13:22,526
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, seriously.

1855
02:13:22,586 --> 02:13:24,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, actually, actually.

1856
02:13:24,887 --> 02:13:26,047
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a bad idea.

1857
02:13:26,607 --> 02:13:27,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1858
02:13:27,308 --> 02:13:27,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris and Megzy.

1859
02:13:28,666 --> 02:13:29,386
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1860
02:13:54,861 --> 02:13:55,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, OLR.

1861
02:13:56,042 --> 02:13:58,082
[SPEAKER_07]: This past week I've been on a nostalgia trip.

1862
02:13:58,122 --> 02:13:58,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you come back?

1863
02:13:59,563 --> 02:14:03,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up digging up my Mega Drive and playing Castle of Illusion and Streets of Rage 2.

1864
02:14:05,345 --> 02:14:06,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm getting all wistful.

1865
02:14:07,586 --> 02:14:09,307
[SPEAKER_07]: It said sigh in there, so I actually sighed.

1866
02:14:10,127 --> 02:14:18,251
[SPEAKER_07]: On a completely different subject, seeing as DarkSakura has been raving about the game, I just thought I'd point out that Fractal is now available in Indie Royale's New Year's Bundle.

1867
02:14:18,471 --> 02:14:20,072
[SPEAKER_07]: That's at IndieRoyale.com.

1868
02:14:20,232 --> 02:14:22,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I-N-D-I-E-R-O-Y-A-L-E.com

1869
02:14:23,713 --> 02:14:28,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Nintendo seems to be going out of their way to make getting the Circle Pad add-on as awkward as possible.

1870
02:14:29,538 --> 02:14:35,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being released exclusively through Zavvi, an online-only retailer here in the UK.

1871
02:14:36,063 --> 02:14:37,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And that looks like a very unhappy face.

1872
02:14:38,325 --> 02:14:39,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Hear you later, Catastrophic Moggy.

1873
02:14:42,188 --> 02:14:45,150
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I love Castle of Illusion and I love Streets of Rage 2.

1874
02:14:46,231 --> 02:14:48,753
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I would say, great gaming.

1875
02:14:50,191 --> 02:14:55,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been actually talking about Fantasy Zone with people and I really need to sit down and hook up the Master System and play some Fantasy Zone.

1876
02:15:01,194 --> 02:15:01,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1877
02:15:02,594 --> 02:15:03,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Fractal.

1878
02:15:03,254 --> 02:15:03,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome game.

1879
02:15:03,814 --> 02:15:05,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone needs to play it so go get that bundle.

1880
02:15:05,875 --> 02:15:08,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, it's in that new bundle.

1881
02:15:08,815 --> 02:15:09,896
[SPEAKER_16]: I was thinking about getting that actually.

1882
02:15:09,956 --> 02:15:10,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it!

1883
02:15:10,996 --> 02:15:11,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, damn!

1884
02:15:13,894 --> 02:15:18,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and then someone sent us a video, but I can't watch it on my computer.

1885
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:20,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, this is just a great comment.

1886
02:15:21,101 --> 02:15:23,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Spazinator making a comment on the last email, the dating advice email.

1887
02:15:24,344 --> 02:15:25,805
[SPEAKER_16]: He needs a Cupid arrow to the knee.

1888
02:15:28,889 --> 02:15:52,008
[SPEAKER_07]: as much as I hate that was pretty good again congratulations to our winners for the three of you that emailed me email me your address and you will get a game in the next couple weeks Master System game at random however I will make every attempt to send you something you don't already have so

1889
02:15:53,584 --> 02:15:53,824
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1890
02:15:53,924 --> 02:15:54,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I texted Dan to remind him.

1891
02:15:54,986 --> 02:15:56,327
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, don't give away my games.

1892
02:15:56,387 --> 02:15:58,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, we already talked about this.

1893
02:15:59,310 --> 02:15:59,551
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1894
02:16:00,051 --> 02:16:00,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop being so stingy.

1895
02:16:01,313 --> 02:16:02,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that it for emails?

1896
02:16:02,134 --> 02:16:02,534
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1897
02:16:02,714 --> 02:16:02,974
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1898
02:16:03,355 --> 02:16:06,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have an email for us.

1899
02:16:06,498 --> 02:16:07,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, literally, we'll read anything.

1900
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:11,724
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that one email was about dating, not even totally about games, but whatever.

1901
02:16:12,205 --> 02:16:13,046
[SPEAKER_16]: And guess what?

1902
02:16:13,666 --> 02:16:13,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Duffy.

1903
02:16:15,308 --> 02:16:16,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Duffy better not send emails to the show.

1904
02:16:17,230 --> 02:16:18,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Duffy.

1905
02:16:18,230 --> 02:16:18,551
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1906
02:16:19,972 --> 02:16:21,893
[SPEAKER_16]: It's time to get into the FUs of the week.

1907
02:16:21,973 --> 02:16:23,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Every week we are angsty.

1908
02:16:24,235 --> 02:16:24,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1909
02:16:24,855 --> 02:16:25,476
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we can.

1910
02:16:41,348 --> 02:16:44,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not at all upset anymore because I have Duffy.

1911
02:16:46,385 --> 02:16:46,806
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.

1912
02:16:48,488 --> 02:16:48,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki!

1913
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:50,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Try Visual Basic.

1914
02:16:58,211 --> 02:17:01,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but see, I don't want to do Visual Basic, that's why I'm using Excel.

1915
02:17:04,015 --> 02:17:06,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, um... I don't know, I'm actually in a pretty good mood.

1916
02:17:06,676 --> 02:17:21,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I should be giving an FU to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow after being off for like two and a half weeks, but I'm... Like, seriously, this is the longest vacation I've had since I started working there, which was ten years ago, which didn't involve me being in the hospital or having surgery, or having the swine flu, which happened once.

1917
02:17:22,126 --> 02:17:25,028
[SPEAKER_16]: And even when I had the swine flu... I'm still sorry about that, Rob.

1918
02:17:25,088 --> 02:17:27,550
[SPEAKER_16]: I was only out for like two weeks, not two and a half, so...

1919
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:31,111
[SPEAKER_16]: But I actually, like, I'm so well rested and feel so good.

1920
02:17:31,151 --> 02:17:35,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, I'm actually, this is weird, looking forward to going back to work.

1921
02:17:35,933 --> 02:17:37,314
[SPEAKER_13]: And then reality will set in.

1922
02:17:37,754 --> 02:17:40,755
[SPEAKER_16]: So F you to that all messing with my mind.

1923
02:17:40,835 --> 02:17:41,775
[SPEAKER_16]: I do, you know what though?

1924
02:17:41,895 --> 02:17:42,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm lucky.

1925
02:17:42,556 --> 02:17:43,256
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very fortunate.

1926
02:17:43,416 --> 02:17:44,497
[SPEAKER_16]: I really do enjoy my job.

1927
02:17:44,997 --> 02:17:46,799
[SPEAKER_16]: I teach people for a living.

1928
02:17:47,159 --> 02:17:47,720
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a great thing.

1929
02:17:47,940 --> 02:17:48,580
[SPEAKER_16]: I love my job.

1930
02:17:48,821 --> 02:17:49,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I really do.

1931
02:17:49,461 --> 02:17:50,582
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're not small children.

1932
02:17:50,702 --> 02:17:57,348
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just sometimes some of the other stuff, everybody gets annoyed with their job at some point.

1933
02:17:57,588 --> 02:18:05,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Because any time you put a bunch of personalities together and one's in charge or whatever, things might go, but I have a great boss.

1934
02:18:05,355 --> 02:18:05,895
[SPEAKER_16]: I really do.

1935
02:18:06,295 --> 02:18:07,296
[SPEAKER_16]: My boss is awesome.

1936
02:18:07,537 --> 02:18:08,537
[SPEAKER_16]: We work so well together.

1937
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:20,198
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't really complain so F you to the fact that I don't take two and a half week vacations more often because I really should and F you to the fact that the only way I was able to do it before was getting the swine flu

1938
02:18:22,674 --> 02:18:24,676
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to reward myself more often.

1939
02:18:25,076 --> 02:18:28,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry I gave you swine flu.

1940
02:18:28,398 --> 02:18:29,639
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

1941
02:18:29,739 --> 02:18:30,860
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know I had it.

1942
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:32,461
[SPEAKER_16]: I rubbed AIDS all over the bear.

1943
02:18:32,882 --> 02:18:33,442
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

1944
02:18:34,723 --> 02:18:35,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1945
02:18:36,784 --> 02:18:37,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's move on.

1946
02:18:38,666 --> 02:18:39,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki.

1947
02:18:40,151 --> 02:19:00,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so Nintendo, being the forefront of digital and online, they apparently slapped the wrists of the owner-director of Icon Games Entertainment, Richard Hill Whithall.

1948
02:19:02,095 --> 02:19:06,276
[SPEAKER_14]: He apparently has released several games in the last year on various platforms.

1949
02:19:07,137 --> 02:19:12,102
[SPEAKER_14]: and he recently shared some sales numbers on the website Gamasutra.

1950
02:19:12,842 --> 02:19:16,686
[SPEAKER_14]: But then was asked by Nintendo to take down the numbers for its platforms.

1951
02:19:17,367 --> 02:19:27,597
[SPEAKER_14]: According to Richard, Nintendo doesn't allow developers to share digital sales numbers for self-published WiiWare and Downloadable DS titles.

1952
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:29,759
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of interesting.

1953
02:19:30,339 --> 02:19:44,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, I guess it hurts smaller developers who need to make those sales numbers known in order to secure financing and plan out business models and stuff like that.

1954
02:19:44,687 --> 02:19:50,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, though, you can still kind of figure out his numbers because he gives a total number and the other platforms do the math.

1955
02:19:51,286 --> 02:19:52,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to do math?

1956
02:19:52,948 --> 02:19:57,033
[SPEAKER_14]: And on top of that, the numbers weren't so good on the Nintendo platforms, unfortunately.

1957
02:19:57,133 --> 02:19:59,876
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe that's why they don't want numbers out there.

1958
02:20:00,036 --> 02:20:06,724
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of saturation on the Wii marketplace, too, and it's really hard for games to stand out because the Wii store isn't set up very well, you know?

1959
02:20:07,244 --> 02:20:11,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so... Yeah, apparently that sucks.

1960
02:20:11,832 --> 02:20:12,092
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1961
02:20:12,953 --> 02:20:17,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we talked a little bit earlier in the show, and I know Bobby talked a lot on his show tonight.

1962
02:20:17,796 --> 02:20:20,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, Bobby Blackwolf was on before us at All Games Radio, talked a lot about SOPA.

1963
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:27,143
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, the Internet's been talking a lot about SOPA, and I'm sure most of you, you know, listening... They're going to scrub it clean of content.

1964
02:20:28,304 --> 02:20:36,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of you guys who are tech-savvy enough to download this podcast and listen to it and understand it probably already have a general awareness about SOPA.

1965
02:20:36,650 --> 02:20:41,476
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is how the message might be communicated to those that don't understand SOPA.

1966
02:20:41,616 --> 02:20:42,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I find this very interesting.

1967
02:20:43,398 --> 02:20:49,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, they're talking about a huge, what they call the nuclear option to protest SOPA.

1968
02:20:49,845 --> 02:20:54,290
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is rumored to be happening on January 23rd because the Senate is going to debate this on the 24th.

1969
02:20:55,131 --> 02:20:58,514
[SPEAKER_16]: AOL, eBay, Facebook, Etsy, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Zynga Game Network

1970
02:21:17,991 --> 02:21:23,054
[SPEAKER_16]: And really, I mean, this is just anybody who cares about tech has a vested interest in SOPA.

1971
02:21:23,254 --> 02:21:29,538
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think I've made this pretty clear, as has Loki, as has DarkSakura, but OLR is obviously against SOPA.

1972
02:21:29,739 --> 02:21:34,782
[SPEAKER_16]: And based on the reason that it gives companies way too much power.

1973
02:21:35,542 --> 02:21:41,406
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that people want to do something about piracy, but there has to be, I think, more accountability in that regard.

1974
02:21:41,466 --> 02:21:41,526
[SPEAKER_16]: And

1975
02:21:41,966 --> 02:21:45,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Soap is not really going to do anything for some sites.

1976
02:21:45,991 --> 02:21:48,894
[SPEAKER_16]: If you know the numbers, you're going to be able to get on the Pirate Bay.

1977
02:21:48,914 --> 02:21:49,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't understand.

1978
02:21:49,655 --> 02:21:50,876
[SPEAKER_14]: So who does it hurt?

1979
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:51,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand.

1980
02:21:52,057 --> 02:22:00,827
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost like to me like a really terrible web filter that's at like someone's office or something like that where it's like, oh, I can't go to Facebook.

1981
02:22:01,127 --> 02:22:01,728
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.com.

1982
02:22:20,982 --> 02:22:21,763
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1983
02:22:41,482 --> 02:22:43,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then again, we can also detain people for no good reason.

1984
02:22:44,743 --> 02:22:48,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know, that's a whole nother Oprah, or so they say.

1985
02:22:48,464 --> 02:22:50,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I think it's all related.

1986
02:22:51,464 --> 02:22:54,585
[SPEAKER_16]: It's screwed up how much power companies have in this country.

1987
02:22:55,185 --> 02:22:55,765
[SPEAKER_16]: It really is.

1988
02:22:56,386 --> 02:23:01,647
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get political on this show nearly as often as she does, but this is something that really irritates me.

1989
02:23:01,667 --> 02:23:07,888
[SPEAKER_16]: And especially when you have all these video game companies where the ESA has stood against it, you know, because, you know, piracy bad.

1990
02:23:08,248 --> 02:23:09,649
[SPEAKER_16]: So the ESA stands against it.

1991
02:23:09,689 --> 02:23:10,969
[SPEAKER_16]: But most of the gaming companies are like...

1992
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:18,253
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of the gaming companies were reached out to for comment and basically came back with, we don't really do politics.

1993
02:23:18,353 --> 02:23:21,815
[SPEAKER_16]: We just make games so the ESA kind of speaks for us.

1994
02:23:23,236 --> 02:23:23,416
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1995
02:23:24,837 --> 02:23:25,037
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1996
02:23:25,857 --> 02:23:26,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Educate yourself.

1997
02:23:27,318 --> 02:23:27,939
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine.

1998
02:23:27,979 --> 02:23:30,060
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to let someone else speak for you.

1999
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:38,104
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be those morons, the people that don't understand why this is very bad, that are going to ruin it.

2000
02:23:38,165 --> 02:23:38,925
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't really affect

2001
02:23:39,405 --> 02:23:42,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as far as their product goes, it doesn't affect them.

2002
02:23:42,386 --> 02:23:57,732
[SPEAKER_16]: The fact that they are these big companies that are going to be able to pull Justin TV feeds and things that might be critical about their game that ought to be legal under fair use when these little reviewers aren't going to be able to fight them, that is, when they don't even fucking understand the law, they just know they can do it.

2003
02:23:58,593 --> 02:23:58,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

2004
02:23:58,833 --> 02:23:59,533
[SPEAKER_14]: That bothers me.

2005
02:23:59,593 --> 02:24:00,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

2006
02:24:00,153 --> 02:24:01,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do they care then?

2007
02:24:01,154 --> 02:24:01,734
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the point.

2008
02:24:01,834 --> 02:24:05,696
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all, well, you're going to give us a bunch of power to take down all these people that we don't like?

2009
02:24:05,756 --> 02:24:06,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.

2010
02:24:06,196 --> 02:24:06,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2011
02:24:07,219 --> 02:24:08,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would I oppose that?

2012
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:15,185
[SPEAKER_14]: But of course they're not going to say, oh, we're strongly for that, because then people backlash against them.

2013
02:24:15,225 --> 02:24:20,388
[SPEAKER_14]: So they've got to take the on-the-fence approach, or, oh, we're just hands-off, we'll let them do whatever.

2014
02:24:21,049 --> 02:24:22,029
[SPEAKER_14]: That way they can't let...

2015
02:24:23,090 --> 02:24:23,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Maintain web silence

2016
02:24:51,552 --> 02:24:53,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you imagine if you can't use Google for a day?

2017
02:24:53,494 --> 02:24:54,975
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that's going to piss some people off.

2018
02:24:55,195 --> 02:24:56,476
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think some people need to be pissed.

2019
02:24:56,556 --> 02:24:57,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's necessary.

2020
02:24:58,798 --> 02:24:59,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's necessary.

2021
02:24:59,798 --> 02:25:01,319
[SPEAKER_07]: They should all go down.

2022
02:25:03,061 --> 02:25:04,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, let's see.

2023
02:25:04,262 --> 02:25:05,343
[SPEAKER_16]: What did I want to say here?

2024
02:25:05,503 --> 02:25:10,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Frisbee in our chat says, May I suggest these companies use ocean marketing to speak for them?

2025
02:25:10,406 --> 02:25:12,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I realize you're making a joke there, but think about it.

2026
02:25:12,048 --> 02:25:13,609
[SPEAKER_16]: How did that whole thing really happen?

2027
02:25:13,649 --> 02:25:13,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2028
02:25:15,350 --> 02:25:19,174
[SPEAKER_16]: The guy represented himself as something he kind of wasn't, right?

2029
02:25:20,175 --> 02:25:20,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

2030
02:25:23,217 --> 02:25:31,405
[SPEAKER_16]: TigerClaw says, I recall years ago, Take-Two sent DMCA notices to several Justin TV channels that were showing GTA 4 when it first came out.

2031
02:25:31,766 --> 02:25:34,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe this is because they didn't want spoilers being leaked.

2032
02:25:35,643 --> 02:25:36,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Too fucking bad.

2033
02:25:37,244 --> 02:25:38,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Spoilers are going to get out there.

2034
02:25:38,404 --> 02:25:40,284
[SPEAKER_16]: If not in text form, it's silly.

2035
02:25:41,465 --> 02:25:44,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, if you want to do something about it... No, that's my problem right there, though.

2036
02:25:44,946 --> 02:25:50,988
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not because your copyrights were violated or because someone's posting it as their own thing.

2037
02:25:51,288 --> 02:25:53,929
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because, oh, we don't want spoilers coming out.

2038
02:25:54,429 --> 02:25:58,614
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not a reason to go and say, hey, I need these videos taken down.

2039
02:25:59,555 --> 02:26:03,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but that's like, you know, a review spoiling the end of a book or something like that.

2040
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:07,906
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't force them to take it down because you don't like the fact that someone spoiled the book.

2041
02:26:09,235 --> 02:26:13,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so anyhow, if you want to do something about SOPA, I gotta give props to Destructoid.

2042
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:16,583
[SPEAKER_16]: They compiled this pretty good article that they have on their website.

2043
02:26:16,663 --> 02:26:19,446
[SPEAKER_16]: It was posted January 7th, talking about SOPA.

2044
02:26:19,466 --> 02:26:25,492
[SPEAKER_16]: And they even have kind of some form letters that you can copy-paste, although I would kind of encourage you to put your own thing on it.

2045
02:26:25,572 --> 02:26:28,094
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, a lot of them probably aren't even going to get read, let's be real.

2046
02:26:28,134 --> 02:26:30,457
[SPEAKER_07]: We should send this to put on our Tumblr, too.

2047
02:26:31,011 --> 02:26:56,407
[SPEAKER_16]: um okay I'll do that uh send that over to um you know I'll get props to Destructoid they did and one other thing I like they compiled a list this is very useful a list of all these game companies where you can contact directly emails and websites and I thought that was pretty cool so you know you can take your case to the companies themselves that are supporting this I am do I need to even say like look at what happened to GoDaddy and that was whoo

2048
02:26:58,226 --> 02:26:58,947
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a bit of a mess.

2049
02:26:59,187 --> 02:27:00,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And talk about a backpedal there.

2050
02:27:00,988 --> 02:27:01,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

2051
02:27:02,149 --> 02:27:05,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, actually, no, we're against SOPA now.

2052
02:27:05,792 --> 02:27:06,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, right.

2053
02:27:08,594 --> 02:27:14,138
[SPEAKER_16]: So let me send that over to Ranma, and he can put that on the Tumblr if you want to read more about that.

2054
02:27:14,198 --> 02:27:15,239
[SPEAKER_16]: OrangeLaunchRadio.tumblr.com.

2055
02:27:17,185 --> 02:27:17,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Alrighty.

2056
02:27:18,606 --> 02:27:19,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's move on with some more news.

2057
02:27:20,207 --> 02:27:24,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Getting into some phone calls very soon at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2058
02:27:24,990 --> 02:27:26,391
[SPEAKER_16]: But not just yet, a few more emails.

2059
02:27:26,431 --> 02:27:26,951
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.

2060
02:27:27,171 --> 02:27:29,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Yu Suzuki, who my husband has met.

2061
02:27:29,633 --> 02:27:31,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a photo of Dan with Yu Suzuki.

2062
02:27:31,494 --> 02:27:32,334
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very faded now.

2063
02:27:33,115 --> 02:27:38,158
[SPEAKER_07]: But he said something in an interview with the Toulouse Game Show.

2064
02:27:38,998 --> 02:27:39,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is in French.

2065
02:27:40,659 --> 02:27:44,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to read it in French, if I can remember my pronunciation right.

2066
02:27:44,642 --> 02:27:47,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Nous pouvons obtenir la licence à partir de Sega.

2067
02:27:48,665 --> 02:27:51,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means, we can obtain the license from Sega.

2068
02:27:51,287 --> 02:27:52,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what they're talking about?

2069
02:27:53,408 --> 02:27:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Shenmue.

2070
02:27:55,149 --> 02:28:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So, he's not saying that they are actively going to do it, but I think it means that there might be an interest in them trying to obtain it for YSNet, which is his company.

2071
02:28:06,037 --> 02:28:06,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2072
02:28:06,717 --> 02:28:08,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So, maybe it'll happen.

2073
02:28:08,698 --> 02:28:10,439
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be kind of cool if it did, don't you think?

2074
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:11,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

2075
02:28:12,220 --> 02:28:14,481
[SPEAKER_16]: I think he should play a game of Lucky Hit.

2076
02:28:19,504 --> 02:28:21,445
[SPEAKER_07]: You know all I ever did with that game was play Space Harrier.

2077
02:28:22,245 --> 02:28:28,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so you can, the interview is actually up on YouTube if you want to find it.

2078
02:28:28,809 --> 02:28:30,830
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Yu Suzuki interview on Shenmue.

2079
02:28:31,470 --> 02:28:31,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2080
02:28:33,644 --> 02:28:35,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, I would be great.

2081
02:28:35,324 --> 02:28:36,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to see that series come back.

2082
02:28:36,745 --> 02:28:38,465
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a lot of people would.

2083
02:28:38,825 --> 02:28:40,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he wants to finish it.

2084
02:28:41,346 --> 02:28:41,466
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

2085
02:28:41,486 --> 02:28:41,766
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

2086
02:28:42,386 --> 02:28:44,707
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like he's got a story that's like mostly told.

2087
02:28:45,427 --> 02:28:47,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got like one chapter left, really?

2088
02:28:48,048 --> 02:28:50,009
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wants it out.

2089
02:28:51,029 --> 02:28:51,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Loki.

2090
02:28:53,628 --> 02:29:12,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually surprised that this took this long to settle, but you remember way back when, back before you could use USB drives on your Xbox 360, you were limited to their overpriced hard drives and their memory units, which really didn't have a lot of space on them and they were really expensive.

2091
02:29:13,092 --> 02:29:38,005
[SPEAKER_14]: and a company, Datel, came out and had this wonderful max memory device that you could plop a micro SD card into and be able to save your games to that and everything was peachy keen until Microsoft patched the Xbox 360 to block these from being used on the device and of course then there was lawsuits filed and all that fun stuff.

2092
02:29:38,045 --> 02:29:39,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they've settled out of court.

2093
02:29:40,146 --> 02:29:48,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably because at this point, even if that were to be allowed to be used on their system, no one's using the memory cards anymore because it doesn't work.

2094
02:29:48,792 --> 02:29:51,053
[SPEAKER_16]: But the consumers who bought these didn't get anything.

2095
02:29:51,334 --> 02:29:51,954
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they got nothing.

2096
02:29:51,974 --> 02:29:57,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, hooray to these companies for settling, but the consumers got screwed, didn't they?

2097
02:29:57,338 --> 02:29:57,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

2098
02:29:58,218 --> 02:30:00,519
[SPEAKER_16]: What do they get out of it for buying these products that don't work?

2099
02:30:00,619 --> 02:30:03,100
[SPEAKER_14]: The satisfaction knowing that the U.S.

2100
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:04,420
[SPEAKER_14]: justice system has triumphed.

2101
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:06,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, golly gee willikers, Loki.

2102
02:30:07,141 --> 02:30:08,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I can sleep at night.

2103
02:30:09,322 --> 02:30:10,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad you can.

2104
02:30:11,683 --> 02:30:11,983
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2105
02:30:12,623 --> 02:30:14,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody's celebrating a birthday this week.

2106
02:30:14,764 --> 02:30:18,065
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, they're turning 30 years old, if you can believe it.

2107
02:30:18,525 --> 02:30:19,286
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the Commodore 64.

2108
02:30:20,871 --> 02:30:24,593
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right, the Commodore 64 celebrated its 30th birthday this week.

2109
02:30:24,633 --> 02:30:27,275
[SPEAKER_16]: And all I have to say is, man, I feel old.

2110
02:30:27,295 --> 02:30:29,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I grew up on the Commodore 64.

2111
02:30:29,816 --> 02:30:31,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember having one of these.

2112
02:30:31,817 --> 02:30:32,978
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we got it Christmas, like, 83.

2113
02:30:34,098 --> 02:30:36,080
[SPEAKER_16]: But the Commodore 64 actually came out in 1982.

2114
02:30:36,180 --> 02:30:39,061
[SPEAKER_16]: I love this.

2115
02:30:39,281 --> 02:30:43,624
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole machine would hold the equivalent of 1 100th of an MP3 file.

2116
02:30:44,204 --> 02:30:45,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha ha ha ha!

2117
02:30:46,829 --> 02:31:05,929
[SPEAKER_16]: $595 is how much these systems cost back in 1982 they say that is now with inflation $1,400 today is how much these things cost it was first introduced at the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and yeah boy Commodore 64 now 30 years old and

2118
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:09,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, I love my Commodore 64.

2119
02:31:10,081 --> 02:31:10,822
[SPEAKER_16]: So many good games.

2120
02:31:10,882 --> 02:31:12,523
[SPEAKER_16]: And those SID chips, man.

2121
02:31:12,723 --> 02:31:17,987
[SPEAKER_16]: So much chiptune stuff that you hear today is just directly influenced by the Commodore 64.

2122
02:31:18,187 --> 02:31:19,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish I still had a working one of these.

2123
02:31:19,848 --> 02:31:21,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a Commodore 64C.

2124
02:31:21,709 --> 02:31:25,311
[SPEAKER_16]: We actually broke our original Commodore 64 and we got a 64C, the white one.

2125
02:31:26,032 --> 02:31:27,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was a pretty awesome machine.

2126
02:31:27,513 --> 02:31:28,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I was five.

2127
02:31:28,854 --> 02:31:29,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have one of these?

2128
02:31:29,554 --> 02:31:30,495
[SPEAKER_07]: When it came out.

2129
02:31:30,535 --> 02:31:31,856
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I told you I didn't have a Commodore 64.

2130
02:31:31,896 --> 02:31:34,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a Clico Atom.

2131
02:31:37,039 --> 02:31:37,860
[SPEAKER_07]: With a cassette deck.

2132
02:31:38,709 --> 02:31:42,672
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, on a related note, would you like to feel old for a minute?

2133
02:31:43,253 --> 02:31:49,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Here are some other games that are turning, not systems, but games that are turning 30 years old this year in 2012.

2134
02:31:49,638 --> 02:31:49,999
[SPEAKER_16]: You ready?

2135
02:31:50,519 --> 02:31:54,102
[SPEAKER_16]: These games came out in 1982, making them 30 years old.

2136
02:31:54,563 --> 02:32:03,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Bagman, Bump and Jump, Burger Time, one of my favorites, Dig Dug, Donkey Kong Jr.,

2137
02:32:04,551 --> 02:32:26,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Gravatar, Joust by the way this list is from ArcadeHeroes.com I am upset with you Joust for influencing that horrible part of WoW Jungle Hunt or Jungle King depending on where you live Kangaroo I freaking love Kangaroo I played the crap out of that at Godfather's Pizza when I was little

2138
02:32:26,962 --> 02:32:29,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Liberator, that's the first one I don't really recognize.

2139
02:32:29,804 --> 02:32:30,664
[SPEAKER_16]: That was an Atari game.

2140
02:32:31,004 --> 02:32:33,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Millipede, Moon Patrol.

2141
02:32:33,265 --> 02:32:33,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, God.

2142
02:32:34,706 --> 02:32:35,686
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to love Moon Patrol.

2143
02:32:35,726 --> 02:32:36,667
[SPEAKER_16]: We had this at Local Arcade.

2144
02:32:36,747 --> 02:32:37,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Do.

2145
02:32:38,267 --> 02:32:39,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I love Mr. Do.

2146
02:32:39,608 --> 02:32:40,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Pango.

2147
02:32:40,869 --> 02:32:41,629
[SPEAKER_16]: You love Pango.

2148
02:32:41,669 --> 02:32:42,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Fucking love Pango.

2149
02:32:42,729 --> 02:32:43,430
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a great game.

2150
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:45,011
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the little penguins.

2151
02:32:45,051 --> 02:32:48,752
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they had one at Pasquale's, and it finally broke.

2152
02:32:49,573 --> 02:32:49,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Aw.

2153
02:32:50,253 --> 02:32:51,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Pole Position.

2154
02:32:51,333 --> 02:32:52,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Love Pole Position.

2155
02:32:52,674 --> 02:32:53,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Popeye.

2156
02:32:54,115 --> 02:32:54,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember that?

2157
02:32:54,876 --> 02:32:57,458
[SPEAKER_16]: They did a Nintendo game out of it because Nintendo made it.

2158
02:32:57,858 --> 02:33:01,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Reactor, Robotron 2084.

2159
02:33:01,141 --> 02:33:02,402
[SPEAKER_16]: They had a version of that on Xbox Live.

2160
02:33:02,422 --> 02:33:04,263
[SPEAKER_16]: That was one of the first arcade games that came out on Xbox Live.

2161
02:33:04,844 --> 02:33:05,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Qbert.

2162
02:33:05,645 --> 02:33:07,786
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another game I played the crap out of on my Kiko.

2163
02:33:08,047 --> 02:33:09,788
[SPEAKER_16]: The swearing guy with a long nose.

2164
02:33:10,849 --> 02:33:12,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody thought this had an awesome name.

2165
02:33:12,650 --> 02:33:13,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Satan's Hollow.

2166
02:33:13,931 --> 02:33:17,454
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually kind of a derpy game, but it was the midway game.

2167
02:33:18,995 --> 02:33:27,604
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on the arcade treasures for Midway and all that, and you kind of see it in collections, but it runs on that same hardware as like Journey and Timber and some of those old classic Midway games.

2168
02:33:28,485 --> 02:33:31,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Sinistar, beware, I live.

2169
02:33:32,689 --> 02:33:40,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Space Duel, Star Trek, the Sega One, Time Pilot, Tootin' Com, Tron,

2170
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:46,302
[SPEAKER_16]: is 30 years old, and Zaxxon by Sagan.

2171
02:33:46,322 --> 02:33:47,923
[SPEAKER_16]: 30 years old.

2172
02:33:47,963 --> 02:33:49,604
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I need to do for Classic Game.

2173
02:33:51,446 --> 02:33:52,206
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

2174
02:33:52,827 --> 02:33:55,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we can all feel old together.

2175
02:33:57,810 --> 02:34:06,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Just think in 30 years when we're sitting here on our show celebrating the 40th anniversary going, hey, remember the Xbox 360?

2176
02:34:06,855 --> 02:34:08,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking bastard stole all my money.

2177
02:34:11,533 --> 02:34:12,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuckin' thing broke!

2178
02:34:12,994 --> 02:34:15,075
[SPEAKER_15]: After only having it a week, I had to send it in.

2179
02:34:16,295 --> 02:34:17,676
[SPEAKER_15]: But damn, there were some good games.

2180
02:34:19,717 --> 02:34:20,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2181
02:34:20,978 --> 02:34:23,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully by then we're all playing the holodeck, though.

2182
02:34:23,399 --> 02:34:26,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Because remember, gaming is just inching forward slowly to the holodeck.

2183
02:34:28,401 --> 02:34:36,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call right now and talk to us.

2184
02:34:36,225 --> 02:34:37,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Meanwhile, let's do some tweets!

2185
02:34:38,956 --> 02:34:42,599
[SPEAKER_16]: We will start with a tweet from Ramaditya Knight.

2186
02:34:42,619 --> 02:34:50,846
[SPEAKER_16]: It says, Sonic and Knuckles, I remember back in the day I used the cheat that allowed me to change Sonic to whatever item I want and cross the wall.

2187
02:34:51,306 --> 02:34:54,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I found a lot of bugs like a place you were not supposed to be able to go there.

2188
02:34:54,369 --> 02:34:55,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Spikes all around.

2189
02:34:55,190 --> 02:34:58,132
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if that was something, is that like a code in the game or is that something like a game genie?

2190
02:34:58,392 --> 02:35:00,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember the game genie where you could like hacksaw the game?

2191
02:35:01,115 --> 02:35:04,117
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure, that is something that Loki had to own.

2192
02:35:04,838 --> 02:35:05,418
[SPEAKER_16]: The game genie.

2193
02:35:05,578 --> 02:35:06,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah.

2194
02:35:06,519 --> 02:35:07,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course I own the game genie.

2195
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:10,681
[SPEAKER_16]: He was talking about Sonic and Knuckles and some of the things you could do with that.

2196
02:35:10,962 --> 02:35:11,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2197
02:35:11,802 --> 02:35:18,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to actually sit down all night with my Game Genie and my SNES and just try to figure out different codes by altering other codes.

2198
02:35:19,765 --> 02:35:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And I found a few ones, like ones that turned Mario green.

2199
02:35:22,447 --> 02:35:22,787
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

2200
02:35:22,827 --> 02:35:23,927
[SPEAKER_07]: All it did was turn Mario green.

2201
02:35:24,367 --> 02:35:24,968
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all it does.

2202
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2203
02:35:26,468 --> 02:35:28,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Makes Mario Luigi, but not really.

2204
02:35:28,629 --> 02:35:29,690
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it turned his skin green.

2205
02:35:30,250 --> 02:35:31,871
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's go to the phones because we're getting some calls.

2206
02:35:31,911 --> 02:35:32,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2207
02:35:32,811 --> 02:35:33,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

2208
02:35:34,312 --> 02:35:34,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2209
02:35:34,912 --> 02:35:35,572
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Kaijudo.

2210
02:35:35,672 --> 02:35:36,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Kaijudo.

2211
02:35:36,333 --> 02:35:36,953
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2212
02:35:38,557 --> 02:35:39,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to talk about the silver thing.

2213
02:35:39,978 --> 02:35:42,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of us are overreacting.

2214
02:35:42,659 --> 02:35:45,000
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I don't think it's going to go through.

2215
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:48,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it did go through, I don't think it's going to be that big of a deal.

2216
02:35:48,481 --> 02:35:52,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of people are getting worked up and they're freaking out all over nothing.

2217
02:35:52,523 --> 02:36:00,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I think pretty much what these companies want to do, you know, the game companies, movies, music, whatever, they just want to make money.

2218
02:36:00,807 --> 02:36:06,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much this law going out is just going to be a way for them to protect their content.

2219
02:36:06,488 --> 02:36:09,549
[SPEAKER_02]: and be able to put it on their sites and make the type of money that they want to make.

2220
02:36:09,589 --> 02:36:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're necessarily trying to shut down the internet or stop us from talking on Facebook or any of that kind of stuff.

2221
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:22,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's a fair viewpoint and I understand that, but could it happen to one person?

2222
02:36:23,891 --> 02:36:31,413
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, like again, I have to refer to the Atari thing at the beginning of the show that they're pulling down all these games that they may or may not have the ability to do.

2223
02:36:32,173 --> 02:36:49,664
[SPEAKER_16]: and I worry that legal departments of companies who don't really understand things might go a little batshit crazy and the problem is if you leave the door or what's the expression you give them an inch and they take a yard I worry about putting that much power into a corporation's hand because you and me can't fight it

2224
02:36:51,549 --> 02:36:51,809
[SPEAKER_16]: True.

2225
02:36:52,730 --> 02:36:54,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see your point there.

2226
02:36:55,491 --> 02:36:57,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Clearly, I understand why they want to do something about piracy.

2227
02:36:58,312 --> 02:36:58,772
[SPEAKER_16]: I get it.

2228
02:36:59,172 --> 02:37:01,693
[SPEAKER_16]: But can you ever really stop piracy?

2229
02:37:02,433 --> 02:37:03,453
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not so sure.

2230
02:37:03,674 --> 02:37:05,074
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way they can stop it.

2231
02:37:05,294 --> 02:37:06,374
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't going to do it.

2232
02:37:07,215 --> 02:37:18,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to cut you off, but if you look at the record, as far as piracy goes, when it comes to movies and video games, a lot of the stuff that's highly pirated are also the stuff that sells the most.

2233
02:37:20,374 --> 02:37:34,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I think music is the only place where they should really do something about piracy because you don't have to mod anything on your system to be able to play the illegal downloaded music that you download.

2234
02:37:34,979 --> 02:37:41,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the music industry is the one that's taking the real heat from it, but not necessarily the games and the movie industry.

2235
02:37:43,171 --> 02:37:50,715
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and again, I understand they want to do something, but I just think this is going to do more harm than good because what's it really going to fix?

2236
02:37:51,456 --> 02:37:56,919
[SPEAKER_16]: The IP for the Pirate Bay will be out there within minutes of this thing passing, and everybody will have it.

2237
02:37:56,959 --> 02:37:59,801
[SPEAKER_16]: And there will be add-ons for Google Chrome and Firefox.

2238
02:37:59,841 --> 02:38:01,202
[SPEAKER_16]: There already are.

2239
02:38:01,222 --> 02:38:02,242
[SPEAKER_16]: There already are.

2240
02:38:02,722 --> 02:38:06,865
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, it's not going to do any good.

2241
02:38:08,646 --> 02:38:33,964
[SPEAKER_16]: but I understand why they want to do something but I think at the end of the day it's going to be accountability you want to prove that someone stole money from a bank they got to go to court, have a trial that's kind of what's got to happen in this case they just need to understand the internet more they're still trying to treat the internet like if it's the real world where it doesn't necessarily work like that so I think that they need to seriously look this over

2242
02:38:34,611 --> 02:38:38,664
[SPEAKER_02]: and come up with the better law, the better soap or whatever the hell you want to call it.

2243
02:38:38,745 --> 02:38:40,611
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not really that worried about it.

2244
02:38:41,954 --> 02:38:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2245
02:38:43,775 --> 02:38:44,756
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope you're right.

2246
02:38:45,857 --> 02:38:49,219
[SPEAKER_16]: But I do worry about leaving that opportunity there.

2247
02:38:49,339 --> 02:38:53,421
[SPEAKER_16]: But you're a little more optimistic than I. So I applaud you for that.

2248
02:38:53,641 --> 02:38:54,422
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope you're right.

2249
02:38:55,082 --> 02:38:57,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Optimistic to a fault.

2250
02:38:57,443 --> 02:38:57,644
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2251
02:38:57,704 --> 02:38:58,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2252
02:38:58,964 --> 02:38:59,725
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have a good night.

2253
02:38:59,885 --> 02:39:00,105
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2254
02:39:00,125 --> 02:39:00,625
[SPEAKER_16]: You too, buddy.

2255
02:39:00,665 --> 02:39:00,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

2256
02:39:00,926 --> 02:39:01,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Good night.

2257
02:39:01,726 --> 02:39:02,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

2258
02:39:02,647 --> 02:39:03,167
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

2259
02:39:03,447 --> 02:39:05,248
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cool that he has a differing opinion.

2260
02:39:05,268 --> 02:39:05,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I hope...

2261
02:39:09,091 --> 02:39:10,532
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think he said it best at the end there.

2262
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:11,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe he's optimistic to a fault.

2263
02:39:12,114 --> 02:39:13,735
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, we'll see.

2264
02:39:13,915 --> 02:39:14,256
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

2265
02:39:14,836 --> 02:39:15,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Actions speak louder than words.

2266
02:39:16,038 --> 02:39:16,478
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll see.

2267
02:39:16,498 --> 02:39:23,285
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just have a feeling the first time a website gets shut down incorrectly, it's going to just, all hell's going to break loose.

2268
02:39:23,725 --> 02:39:24,967
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2269
02:39:24,987 --> 02:39:26,008
[SPEAKER_16]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2270
02:39:26,068 --> 02:39:27,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2271
02:39:27,889 --> 02:39:29,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Meanwhile, we have some more tweets.

2272
02:39:29,645 --> 02:39:32,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey guys, it's DDR Dollar Bill DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind buddy?

2273
02:39:56,345 --> 02:39:56,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

2274
02:39:57,026 --> 02:39:58,767
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I want to wish you guys a happy new year.

2275
02:39:58,887 --> 02:40:00,788
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting some feedback.

2276
02:40:00,808 --> 02:40:01,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Back away from your speakers, buddy.

2277
02:40:01,929 --> 02:40:03,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Back away from your speakers if you can.

2278
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:03,991
[SPEAKER_16]: We're getting bad feedback.

2279
02:40:04,591 --> 02:40:05,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy new year to you.

2280
02:40:06,352 --> 02:40:06,893
[SPEAKER_01]: How's this now?

2281
02:40:08,154 --> 02:40:09,735
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still hearing it, but it's not killing me.

2282
02:40:09,815 --> 02:40:10,375
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not horrible.

2283
02:40:10,516 --> 02:40:12,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Get out your question or comment fast.

2284
02:40:12,257 --> 02:40:13,238
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to make this a quick call.

2285
02:40:14,418 --> 02:40:15,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

2286
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:16,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a quick story.

2287
02:40:17,301 --> 02:40:25,827
[SPEAKER_01]: A while back, I don't know if I posted it, but I said that I stopped playing WoW because I got sick of all the jackasses kept bitching about everything I kept doing in the game.

2288
02:40:27,537 --> 02:40:27,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

2289
02:40:28,098 --> 02:40:28,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we can hear you.

2290
02:40:29,018 --> 02:40:31,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, people are assholes on the internet, unfortunately.

2291
02:40:32,802 --> 02:40:37,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so for a long time I pretty much just quit whole MMORPGs.

2292
02:40:38,107 --> 02:40:40,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I tried a couple other free ones out there.

2293
02:40:41,430 --> 02:40:45,473
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I tried out DC Universe when it came out for free.

2294
02:40:46,294 --> 02:40:49,517
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point I loved it so much I actually bought the DLCs for it.

2295
02:40:49,917 --> 02:40:52,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying the community in DC Universe Online maybe not so bad?

2296
02:40:54,717 --> 02:41:10,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, considering that one time I played 1.30 in the morning and we were making jokes about, um, let's see, 16 year olds and an all women's squad and everybody was dueling in the middle of nowhere, it was a lot more fun.

2297
02:41:11,189 --> 02:41:13,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but it goes back to WoW for one last thing, because I'll keep it short.

2298
02:41:13,570 --> 02:41:13,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2299
02:41:40,618 --> 02:41:47,786
[SPEAKER_01]: When I finally hit level 30 in EC Universe, the final level, I found out that I actually have to group.

2300
02:41:48,867 --> 02:41:52,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me realize that maybe it's okay to group with people once in a while.

2301
02:41:53,091 --> 02:41:55,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Just gotta find the right group.

2302
02:41:55,073 --> 02:42:02,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went back on WoW, I quit this one guild I was with, and I joined up with another guild, and it was a whole different experience.

2303
02:42:02,918 --> 02:42:04,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have to tell you something.

2304
02:42:04,059 --> 02:42:04,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Perfect story.

2305
02:42:04,839 --> 02:42:09,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got to hang up on you, DDR Darla Bill, though, because the chat room is saying it sounds like you're living in a bee's nest.

2306
02:42:09,641 --> 02:42:10,802
[SPEAKER_16]: But thank you so much, buddy.

2307
02:42:10,842 --> 02:42:11,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good one.

2308
02:42:11,662 --> 02:42:12,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me say something to him.

2309
02:42:13,343 --> 02:42:13,683
[SPEAKER_16]: He'll hear it.

2310
02:42:14,244 --> 02:42:16,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's what I was going to tell you, and just message me in the chat room.

2311
02:42:18,206 --> 02:42:23,088
[SPEAKER_07]: When I started playing WoW, when I finally liked it again, I did not play with other people at all.

2312
02:42:23,808 --> 02:42:26,730
[SPEAKER_07]: All I did was chat with the guild and quest by myself.

2313
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:29,591
[SPEAKER_07]: and yeah, and I've done two characters that way.

2314
02:42:30,171 --> 02:42:32,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I did Rebecca Black and Arisa both that way.

2315
02:42:32,631 --> 02:42:37,032
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I've actually got a character that I'm doing nothing but instances with.

2316
02:42:37,753 --> 02:42:40,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe seasonal quests and little things.

2317
02:42:41,274 --> 02:42:49,676
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is that I'm actually trying to group with other people and I've found that actually not every group is full of idiots.

2318
02:42:50,116 --> 02:42:50,876
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them are.

2319
02:42:51,576 --> 02:42:54,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of them don't have proper grammar and they're very hard to understand.

2320
02:42:55,117 --> 02:43:01,160
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, it's partly your support group outside of your pugs.

2321
02:43:15,947 --> 02:43:18,250
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2322
02:43:33,131 --> 02:43:39,317
[SPEAKER_16]: You gotta understand, a lot of these people are just doing it to get their rocks off, you know what I mean?

2323
02:43:39,637 --> 02:43:41,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, you know, Frat Matt, yeah, you know him.

2324
02:43:41,599 --> 02:43:42,680
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been on this show too.

2325
02:43:43,261 --> 02:43:51,248
[SPEAKER_07]: He and me and John were running an instance and decided to completely troll the people that we were with, and Mary.

2326
02:43:51,768 --> 02:43:52,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-huh.

2327
02:43:52,629 --> 02:43:54,710
[SPEAKER_07]: decided to completely troll our fifth person.

2328
02:43:55,070 --> 02:43:55,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2329
02:43:55,631 --> 02:43:59,212
[SPEAKER_16]: That poor person doesn't know that you're just fucking with them.

2330
02:43:59,713 --> 02:44:02,674
[SPEAKER_07]: We finally had one person hang out with us.

2331
02:44:03,194 --> 02:44:06,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Now keep in mind, and people who play WoW will know what it is, it was in Halls of Origination.

2332
02:44:07,236 --> 02:44:10,498
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to the last, we did all of the bosses, all of them.

2333
02:44:10,598 --> 02:44:10,918
[SPEAKER_06]: All of them?

2334
02:44:11,298 --> 02:44:12,239
[SPEAKER_07]: In Halls of Origination.

2335
02:44:12,579 --> 02:44:17,381
[SPEAKER_07]: We finally get to the last guy and we get a person who's just really cool and playing along with us.

2336
02:44:17,961 --> 02:44:19,562
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, that's what we wanted.

2337
02:44:19,682 --> 02:44:21,223
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanted the person who would play with us.

2338
02:44:21,323 --> 02:44:22,784
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm calling in to do a con report Con report?

2339
02:44:22,804 --> 02:44:23,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Who had a con at New Year's?

2340
02:44:23,465 --> 02:44:28,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, it was MagFest this weekend Oh, this weekend, okay, I guess this weekend's not so bad Alright, MagFest, how was it?

2341
02:44:48,203 --> 02:44:48,723
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty good.

2342
02:44:48,763 --> 02:44:55,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It was down in D.C., and basically it's just a big arcade festival.

2343
02:44:55,906 --> 02:45:01,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I was going to say, is this the Sony game mag, or is this like a... Okay, so it's an arcade game, okay.

2344
02:45:02,029 --> 02:45:02,930
[SPEAKER_10]: It's arcade games.

2345
02:45:04,130 --> 02:45:12,834
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people bring arcade machines, and it's also a big show for video game music.

2346
02:45:13,775 --> 02:45:14,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool.

2347
02:45:15,595 --> 02:45:19,519
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, their guest of honor was Nobuo Matsu and his band.

2348
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:21,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the Black Mages?

2349
02:45:23,142 --> 02:45:24,703
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Earthbound Papas.

2350
02:45:25,264 --> 02:45:26,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I didn't know he had another one.

2351
02:45:26,725 --> 02:45:27,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, very cool.

2352
02:45:28,975 --> 02:45:47,510
[SPEAKER_10]: and but yeah you know they had it was uh the thing is it's a 24-hour convention so at any so at any point you know if you have a if you feel like you know you want to play DDR or Pong or Killer Instincts 2 Arcade Machine you can go down three o'clock in the morning you could play

2353
02:45:47,890 --> 02:45:53,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, so you're saying like it's a 24-7, like for the weekend, or it literally is 24 hours?

2354
02:45:53,674 --> 02:45:56,176
[SPEAKER_16]: It's literally like 24-7 from Thursday to Sunday.

2355
02:45:56,196 --> 02:45:56,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

2356
02:45:56,837 --> 02:45:57,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well, that's still really cool.

2357
02:45:58,138 --> 02:46:00,279
[SPEAKER_16]: That's got to be a bitch to staff, but that's awesome.

2358
02:46:00,699 --> 02:46:02,401
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of wish California Extreme would do that.

2359
02:46:03,161 --> 02:46:05,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but... No, you know what?

2360
02:46:05,903 --> 02:46:10,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually is kind of like California Extreme, where, you know, there's about like 150 arcade machines.

2361
02:46:10,967 --> 02:46:12,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I got to... I mean, my whole goal...

2362
02:46:15,379 --> 02:46:18,822
[SPEAKER_10]: was to try to get a high score on one classic arcade game.

2363
02:46:19,443 --> 02:46:22,606
[SPEAKER_10]: And I managed to get the high score on Road Blasters.

2364
02:46:22,986 --> 02:46:24,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Road Blasters!

2365
02:46:24,207 --> 02:46:25,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, I remember that one.

2366
02:46:25,328 --> 02:46:26,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Road Blasters is awesome.

2367
02:46:26,149 --> 02:46:27,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, good times.

2368
02:46:27,330 --> 02:46:28,611
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also hell's hard.

2369
02:46:29,392 --> 02:46:29,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Amen to that.

2370
02:46:30,072 --> 02:46:34,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you get to play anything new that you'd never really played before that you were like, wow, how did I miss this growing up?

2371
02:46:36,308 --> 02:46:36,828
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

2372
02:46:37,168 --> 02:46:47,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I was, you know, a lot of old games like NARC and Bad Dudes that really took me back because I haven't seen those things since the early 80s.

2373
02:46:48,812 --> 02:46:55,714
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, also I was introduced to a lot of old games that, you know, I've never seen or heard of.

2374
02:46:56,834 --> 02:46:59,675
[SPEAKER_10]: This crazy game Ice Cold Beer.

2375
02:47:01,716 --> 02:47:02,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like Tapper.

2376
02:47:04,096 --> 02:47:05,197
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not really like that.

2377
02:47:05,237 --> 02:47:05,597
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like you...

2378
02:47:07,421 --> 02:47:10,723
[SPEAKER_10]: You're playing with two levers and you're trying to put a ball into a hole.

2379
02:47:11,643 --> 02:47:13,424
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds kind of dirty.

2380
02:47:13,524 --> 02:47:14,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it sounds kind of sexual.

2381
02:47:16,886 --> 02:47:17,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been to that party.

2382
02:47:21,409 --> 02:47:22,949
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet's seen that party, Rob.

2383
02:47:24,682 --> 02:47:26,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, but no, I get what you're saying.

2384
02:47:27,584 --> 02:47:28,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

2385
02:47:28,805 --> 02:47:30,005
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's definitely cool.

2386
02:47:30,406 --> 02:47:31,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Did they have speakers or anything?

2387
02:47:31,766 --> 02:47:32,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I guess just the musicians.

2388
02:47:33,508 --> 02:47:34,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, they had a lot of speakers.

2389
02:47:34,928 --> 02:47:38,130
[SPEAKER_10]: They had, you know, the Angry Video Game Nerd, Brennel Floss, you know, a lot of people.

2390
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:39,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the Angry Video Game Nerd.

2391
02:47:41,072 --> 02:47:41,993
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.

2392
02:47:42,033 --> 02:47:44,214
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very, you know, very small convention.

2393
02:47:44,714 --> 02:47:46,115
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's big.

2394
02:47:46,255 --> 02:47:52,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, not only were you able to play classic arcade games, you were also able to check out

2395
02:47:53,511 --> 02:47:57,512
[SPEAKER_10]: console games and play stuff on a TV.

2396
02:47:57,672 --> 02:48:01,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, damn, if I'm able to get another two and a half weeks off work next holiday, I might have to come out there.

2397
02:48:01,493 --> 02:48:02,614
[SPEAKER_16]: That sounds like an awesome con.

2398
02:48:03,114 --> 02:48:03,714
[SPEAKER_16]: I love DC.

2399
02:48:03,734 --> 02:48:04,694
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love an excuse to go back.

2400
02:48:06,015 --> 02:48:07,835
[SPEAKER_16]: But I guess I need to get to New York City first, huh?

2401
02:48:10,296 --> 02:48:11,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Gotta stop going to Disneyland.

2402
02:48:11,416 --> 02:48:13,617
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are going to have to confiscate my annual pass for that to happen.

2403
02:48:15,539 --> 02:48:16,640
[SPEAKER_10]: They moved Disneyland.

2404
02:48:17,361 --> 02:48:18,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Disneyland burned down, sorry to say.

2405
02:48:19,284 --> 02:48:22,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, SSJ100 Matt, thanks so much for telling us about the con.

2406
02:48:22,247 --> 02:48:22,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I had no idea.

2407
02:48:22,728 --> 02:48:26,212
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on the wrong coast, so I had no idea this was happening, but I'm definitely going to check it out for next year.

2408
02:48:27,214 --> 02:48:27,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.

2409
02:48:27,594 --> 02:48:28,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2410
02:48:30,305 --> 02:48:31,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys so much for the phone calls.

2411
02:48:31,686 --> 02:48:37,790
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line for now so we can wrap up the last few topics here and close up shop for the night.

2412
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:46,316
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you didn't get through tonight and you have something you really want to say, be sure to send us a tweet at twitter.com slash OLR or you can email us, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

2413
02:48:46,576 --> 02:48:49,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of tweets, I wanted to finish Tiger Claw's thought here.

2414
02:48:49,418 --> 02:48:53,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, this is coming from a leak at the Sony booth at CES.

2415
02:48:53,901 --> 02:48:59,605
[SPEAKER_16]: It's showing on the PlayStation 3 something called Play Memory Studio which will be... Excuse me.

2416
02:49:01,026 --> 02:49:01,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, worst thing to happen on radio.

2417
02:49:02,607 --> 02:49:04,988
[SPEAKER_16]: A video editing suite for the PlayStation 3.

2418
02:49:06,189 --> 02:49:11,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently you can put effects in video and kind of do some editing live on the PlayStation 3.

2419
02:49:11,753 --> 02:49:12,934
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of cool, I guess.

2420
02:49:13,495 --> 02:49:19,059
[SPEAKER_16]: I already thought the PlayStation did kind of allow some limited video stuff, but that's cool if they're enhancing it, especially if it's free.

2421
02:49:20,099 --> 02:49:21,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if it'll be free.

2422
02:49:21,480 --> 02:49:22,141
[SPEAKER_16]: I somehow doubt it.

2423
02:49:22,881 --> 02:49:28,165
[SPEAKER_16]: TomN1 on Twitter sent us this and I saw this earlier this week because somebody posted this on Facebook.

2424
02:49:28,185 --> 02:49:29,206
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fucking hilarious.

2425
02:49:29,566 --> 02:49:32,228
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a Macho Man dragon mod in Skyrim.

2426
02:49:32,268 --> 02:49:33,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, have you seen this?

2427
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:35,811
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great.

2428
02:49:37,813 --> 02:49:43,277
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the beginning of the game.

2429
02:49:43,397 --> 02:49:44,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is again.

2430
02:49:44,718 --> 02:49:45,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear that?

2431
02:49:46,999 --> 02:49:49,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, next prisoner.

2432
02:49:49,421 --> 02:49:50,422
[SPEAKER_09]: To the block, prisoner.

2433
02:49:50,962 --> 02:49:51,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice and easy.

2434
02:49:53,208 --> 02:49:54,669
[SPEAKER_16]: This is actually being rendered from the game.

2435
02:49:54,709 --> 02:49:56,191
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not like a fan-edited thing.

2436
02:49:57,292 --> 02:49:58,092
[SPEAKER_16]: With the mod, of course.

2437
02:50:07,161 --> 02:50:09,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Macho madness, sky's the limit!

2438
02:50:14,395 --> 02:50:20,497
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a thing of pure terror.

2439
02:50:20,897 --> 02:50:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's a giant Macho Man!

2440
02:50:27,459 --> 02:50:29,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the dragon's wearing a Macho Man hat.

2441
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:30,440
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great!

2442
02:50:31,820 --> 02:50:36,161
[SPEAKER_03]: With the beard and everything.

2443
02:50:36,542 --> 02:50:38,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm making Alan install this mod.

2444
02:50:42,998 --> 02:50:44,079
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really creepy.

2445
02:50:44,239 --> 02:50:45,379
[SPEAKER_16]: I fucking love that.

2446
02:50:45,419 --> 02:50:46,219
[SPEAKER_16]: That's amazing.

2447
02:50:46,479 --> 02:50:47,420
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to know something, Rob?

2448
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:48,660
[SPEAKER_16]: I need that on the Tumblr.

2449
02:50:49,061 --> 02:50:49,701
[SPEAKER_07]: That song.

2450
02:50:50,361 --> 02:50:52,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's stories from Jamie's childhood.

2451
02:50:53,302 --> 02:50:58,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Disco Inferno, which keep in mind, I had two copies of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack on vinyl.

2452
02:50:58,985 --> 02:51:04,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to stand on my bed dancing in my pajamas to Disco Inferno.

2453
02:51:05,539 --> 02:51:08,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I gave that to Ranma for the Twitter because that video is just too damn good if you haven't seen it yet.

2454
02:51:09,061 --> 02:51:10,602
[SPEAKER_16]: I also posted the link in chat.

2455
02:51:10,702 --> 02:51:11,243
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

2456
02:51:11,463 --> 02:51:11,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy, guys.

2457
02:51:12,403 --> 02:51:16,026
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the one that says TeeCo because I got it from Twitter because TomN linked that.

2458
02:51:16,486 --> 02:51:16,906
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

2459
02:51:17,586 --> 02:51:17,847
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2460
02:51:18,367 --> 02:51:21,989
[SPEAKER_16]: And lastly, a couple tweets here from ZenMonkey69 tweets us.

2461
02:51:23,911 --> 02:51:29,577
[SPEAKER_16]: HeHe69 tweets us saying, It's 2012 and we have a shitload of video game sequels coming.

2462
02:51:29,977 --> 02:51:35,143
[SPEAKER_16]: What games do you think don't deserve a sequel and should just die?

2463
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:38,822
[SPEAKER_16]: What games don't deserve a sequel and should just die?

2464
02:51:38,842 --> 02:51:39,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Imagine Babies

2465
02:52:00,655 --> 02:52:07,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Taiki, I hope I'm saying that right, in chat says Elder Scrolls, just throwing it down, saying there's too damn many Elder Scrolls games.

2466
02:52:07,422 --> 02:52:08,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about that.

2467
02:52:08,844 --> 02:52:09,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Skyrim's pretty fun.

2468
02:52:09,545 --> 02:52:11,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you won't have another Elder Scrolls game in 2012.

2469
02:52:12,007 --> 02:52:13,929
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll have expansions for Skyrim, that's for sure.

2470
02:52:14,530 --> 02:52:15,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for sure.

2471
02:52:15,851 --> 02:52:17,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Franchises that need to die.

2472
02:52:19,575 --> 02:52:20,476
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, God.

2473
02:52:26,362 --> 02:52:32,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of me wants to be cynical and say the Just Dance series, but at parties they can be kind of fun.

2474
02:52:35,107 --> 02:52:39,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't really think of anything, because honestly, if I don't want to play them, I just ignore that they exist.

2475
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:41,111
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of where I'm at.

2476
02:52:41,131 --> 02:52:44,433
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think a lot about the games that I don't want to play.

2477
02:52:45,414 --> 02:52:48,335
[SPEAKER_16]: I can be super cynical and go, oh, Call of Duty, because I don't play those games.

2478
02:52:48,375 --> 02:52:50,236
[SPEAKER_16]: But I realize other people do play those games.

2479
02:52:50,937 --> 02:52:51,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2480
02:52:54,744 --> 02:52:56,324
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm kind of looking over at my own collection.

2481
02:52:56,524 --> 02:52:57,745
[SPEAKER_16]: How about Tetris Remakes?

2482
02:52:58,805 --> 02:52:59,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2483
02:52:59,285 --> 02:53:00,505
[SPEAKER_16]: That's another one I'm getting sick of.

2484
02:53:00,525 --> 02:53:03,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Blastris was kind of fun, but that was back in the Super Scope days.

2485
02:53:03,386 --> 02:53:07,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently that 3DS one's pretty good, but it's still the same fucking game we've been playing forever.

2486
02:53:09,968 --> 02:53:12,108
[SPEAKER_16]: It might be time for the Need for Speed series to die.

2487
02:53:12,568 --> 02:53:12,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

2488
02:53:14,769 --> 02:53:16,109
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be another answer I would have.

2489
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:21,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, or at least evolve it or something.

2490
02:53:21,731 --> 02:53:22,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2491
02:53:22,851 --> 02:53:23,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic Games

2492
02:53:44,850 --> 02:53:45,891
[SPEAKER_07]: SILENT HILL

2493
02:54:06,265 --> 02:54:07,325
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of agree.

2494
02:54:07,506 --> 02:54:11,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Non-Kanami Japan produced Silent Hill games specifically Need to Die.

2495
02:54:11,989 --> 02:54:14,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to go back in-house to Kanami Japan.

2496
02:54:14,851 --> 02:54:15,271
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree.

2497
02:54:15,311 --> 02:54:16,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Silent Hill's kind of done.

2498
02:54:16,672 --> 02:54:21,155
[SPEAKER_14]: And Carriker Revolution Glee needs to die.

2499
02:54:21,175 --> 02:54:22,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there you go.

2500
02:54:22,416 --> 02:54:22,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Winner.

2501
02:54:22,556 --> 02:54:24,298
[SPEAKER_16]: How about everything Glee needs to die?

2502
02:54:24,318 --> 02:54:26,039
[SPEAKER_16]: How about Glee needs to get cancelled?

2503
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:27,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2504
02:54:28,749 --> 02:54:34,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Last, another tweet from Zen, since I haven't read tweets from Zen before, I will read two tweets tonight.

2505
02:54:34,597 --> 02:54:44,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Zen says, if PlayStation 4, Xbox Lube, and the Nintendo Wii U were all coming out on the same day, and you could only get one, which system would you get?

2506
02:54:45,123 --> 02:54:46,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Too early!

2507
02:54:47,286 --> 02:54:47,946
[SPEAKER_16]: How can he answer that?

2508
02:54:47,966 --> 02:54:54,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we don't know what the Xbox Lube and the PlayStation 4 have to offer, and we only know about half of what the Wii U's really bring into the table.

2509
02:54:55,675 --> 02:55:00,420
[SPEAKER_16]: So you'd be asking me to base that decision based off of the current consoles.

2510
02:55:00,781 --> 02:55:04,925
[SPEAKER_16]: And the problem with that is the jump we made from the last...

2511
02:55:05,706 --> 02:55:05,986
[SPEAKER_16]: and DarkSakura.

2512
02:55:21,357 --> 02:55:25,140
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, so it's just, it's way too early to call.

2513
02:55:27,562 --> 02:55:34,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's also the realistic in me is like, well, I'm going to end up with them all anyway because I have this sick addiction to video games and do this show and everything.

2514
02:55:34,427 --> 02:55:41,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of like... I'm going to try to show some restraint, at least maybe not buying one of the consoles, if not two of the consoles.

2515
02:55:41,492 --> 02:55:42,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.

2516
02:55:43,093 --> 02:56:10,772
[SPEAKER_16]: you know what though honestly with you would have played on the Wii and stuff I think it's gonna be pretty easy for the Wii U I think I say that now I will humor the question and I'm gonna say PlayStation 4 and the reason why is because I just have the feeling out of the three systems it's going to be the most advanced because I think it's gonna be the one that's in the incubator the longest meaning I think it'll be the last of the three to come out so I think it's gonna have the best processor in it and all that I

2517
02:56:11,172 --> 02:56:24,251
[SPEAKER_16]: but again, that doesn't necessarily make it the best, but I literally have nothing else to go off of right now, you know so, I'm gonna say PlayStation 4 just to humor the question, but that could change, absolutely so

2518
02:56:25,430 --> 02:56:28,693
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, that's it for the Twitters tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.

2519
02:56:28,813 --> 02:56:30,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, actually, I see one.

2520
02:56:31,075 --> 02:56:31,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, never mind.

2521
02:56:31,615 --> 02:56:32,836
[SPEAKER_16]: That's somebody new following us.

2522
02:56:32,876 --> 02:56:33,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you on Twitter.

2523
02:56:34,558 --> 02:56:37,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Twitter combines the followers and the app messages now.

2524
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:37,640
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really weird.

2525
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:42,624
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, anyway, last-minute stories, Loki, DarkSakura, anything for last-minute stories?

2526
02:56:44,446 --> 02:56:44,586
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2527
02:56:45,547 --> 02:56:45,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki?

2528
02:56:47,824 --> 02:56:50,747
[SPEAKER_14]: My story is that I had trouble finding a Cage Mad song.

2529
02:56:50,787 --> 02:56:53,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Thankfully, I downloaded one a while ago, so then I'll be fine.

2530
02:56:54,251 --> 02:56:55,332
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not my preference.

2531
02:56:56,534 --> 02:56:59,297
[SPEAKER_14]: They've had some better songs, but I'm going to put it in anyways.

2532
02:57:00,023 --> 02:57:02,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that's going to do it then for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2533
02:57:02,945 --> 02:57:05,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

2534
02:57:06,728 --> 02:57:06,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

2535
02:57:07,568 --> 02:57:08,128
[SPEAKER_14]: How rude.

2536
02:57:08,169 --> 02:57:13,712
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a step way, way, way back to the beginning of the show here and we're talking about best games of 2011.

2537
02:57:13,792 --> 02:57:18,135
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really a game, but I have to recommend Ready Player One.

2538
02:57:18,175 --> 02:57:20,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, if you haven't read it yet, you need to read it because it's awesome.

2539
02:57:21,758 --> 02:57:25,000
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're a fan of games, especially a fan of classic games, you're going to love this.

2540
02:57:27,882 --> 02:57:28,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me.

2541
02:57:29,204 --> 02:57:31,326
[SPEAKER_14]: and any of them to actually sign my book.

2542
02:57:31,346 --> 02:57:34,088
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be pretty awesome if he's going to hit a con or something.

2543
02:57:34,449 --> 02:57:35,429
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm getting coffin fit again.

2544
02:57:35,489 --> 02:57:36,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to say this.

2545
02:57:36,070 --> 02:57:45,518
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'm allowed to say this because it's out there posted on the internet but apparently in Sacramento there's going to be a group that is going to do a live shadow casting a la Rocky Horror of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.

2546
02:57:45,698 --> 02:57:46,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see this.

2547
02:57:46,659 --> 02:57:47,660
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can't wait.

2548
02:57:47,880 --> 02:57:57,208
[SPEAKER_16]: As much as I have kind of a love-hate with that movie and there are things I loved about it and things I didn't like about it I think that's going to be awesome because you know that theater is going to be full of nerds

2549
02:57:58,048 --> 02:58:00,509
[SPEAKER_16]: that are into it, you know, and I think it's going to be a great showing.

2550
02:58:00,549 --> 02:58:08,993
[SPEAKER_16]: I definitely am going to see, because I know the guys that are behind it through some of the stuff I did last year, so I'm going to see if we can get OLR sponsored or something.

2551
02:58:09,773 --> 02:58:10,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Coins?

2552
02:58:10,613 --> 02:58:11,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, oh.

2553
02:58:12,174 --> 02:58:12,934
[SPEAKER_16]: From the movie, I get it.

2554
02:58:13,394 --> 02:58:13,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, anyhow.

2555
02:58:14,735 --> 02:58:16,456
[SPEAKER_16]: You were talking about Ready Player One.

2556
02:58:16,476 --> 02:58:17,556
[SPEAKER_16]: People are going to throw quarters.

2557
02:58:18,516 --> 02:58:23,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Ready Player One has been an option for a movie, but I don't see how the fuck they're going to be able to do that.

2558
02:58:23,178 --> 02:58:23,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, though.

2559
02:58:24,839 --> 02:58:26,920
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll get you Ready Player One.

2560
02:58:28,773 --> 02:58:45,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Legend of Zaku in chat says oh wow Rocky Horror Picture Show finally has competition now hold on Becky wants to go too there's there Rocky's kind of like it's just there can be more than one movie in the theater at a time and Rocky's just always there's always more than one cult movie Repo the Genetic Opera for example is really big on the midnight circuit right now

2561
02:58:46,051 --> 02:58:46,492
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2562
02:59:00,908 --> 02:59:03,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyhow, off subject, we're trying to wrap up the show.

2563
02:59:04,091 --> 02:59:07,073
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say thank you very much for downloading the show and tuning in to us.

2564
02:59:07,374 --> 02:59:12,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, we don't put commercials in the show, we don't make you buy things or whatever.

2565
02:59:12,438 --> 02:59:14,379
[SPEAKER_16]: All we ask, tell people about the show.

2566
02:59:14,520 --> 02:59:17,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar website.

2567
02:59:18,183 --> 02:59:23,067
[SPEAKER_16]: We rely on you guys to help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio and we really, really appreciate it.

2568
02:59:23,587 --> 02:59:50,932
[SPEAKER_16]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the website the forums are there if you want to post on the forums I have to say though right now it's locked down to new accounts because yeah we were really getting killed with spammers there so I just shut off accounts all together so hopefully within the next month or two we're going to just totally revamp the forums and hopefully be able to avoid the spam bots if you really want an account on the forums in the meantime email the show directly and we'll set one up for you Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you don't already have one

2569
02:59:51,332 --> 03:00:10,451
[SPEAKER_16]: and Legend of Zaku I totally agree Priscilla Queen of the Desert is the closest thing they can take on Rocky Horror Picture Show that's a Broadway thing now so yeah it was supposed to come out on Broadway I'm pretty sure it did so alright anyhow that's it now we're talking Broadway we're way off the subject of video games

2570
03:00:10,791 --> 03:00:14,272
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back next week to talk more games and gaming news with you guys.

2571
03:00:14,613 --> 03:00:15,833
[SPEAKER_16]: So have a wonderful week everybody.
