Tonight, January 8th, 2012

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Could the next Xbox also be a digital video recorder?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One retailer suggests a release date for Diablo 3

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and rumors of new consoles in E3 2012 are already starting

Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
with my co-hosts

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I really like salads

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Salads are delicious

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I just tossed mine

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Into my mouth

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh dear, that's not better actually

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I know

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Welcome back and welcome to Studio 6, Techmaster Loki

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hi

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How are you doing?

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Really wish you could have been here last week

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's alright, you had family stuff going on

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, I had to go eat dinner at some

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, well I had to go get free dinner

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It sucks, my life sucks

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Alright, chat.orangelaundry.com is the place to be if you are listening live

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Of course, as I mentioned before, we are live every Sunday night

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Tonight, episode number 441

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
January the 8th, 2012

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So Loki, of course you were out last week

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is the first time you've ever been to my place, I was realizing

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's correct

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Because you needed directions on how to get here

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So welcome

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I wish you could have seen it before we created a studio

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
out of what literally was nothing

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's pretty awesome

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, Dark Soccer might be able to remember, I don't know

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But, anyhow

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How have you been?

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This table was loaded with paper

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, it was

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It was the paper table

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How have you been, Loki?

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How was your holiday?

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Did you have a good time off?

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, it was alright

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I mean, we just

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hung around the house for the most part

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Just, you know, Josh got a lot of gifts

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And, um

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In times that he's not awake, I'm playing Skyrim

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Very cool

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And somebody just joined the chat named

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I love OLR

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, we love you

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I love OLR and chat says

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Swotore, or as I've been calling it on the other show

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hoard House, Sweatore

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sweatore leveling, which is of course

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Old Republic, Star Wars

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Plus, OLR in the background equals

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Best Sunday night ever

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I gotta admit, that's how I like to listen to live shows

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've tuned into some of the other all-game shows a few times

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like Dead Pixel Live, Video Game Outsiders

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I'll play WoW

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Because I've only been playing Sweatore for about three weeks

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But like, I'll play WoW and do PVP and listen to

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You know, Video Game Outsiders or whatever

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a good time

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I remember when my friend was working on Knights of the Old Republic

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And she was calling it Scrotore

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know, it would be awesome if you could do that on the Xbox 360

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You know, stream stuff in

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Like, you know, one of our live stations

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He has the custom, you know, playlists

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Didn't somebody create an app that did that some time ago?

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't remember there was an app years ago

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There was, it's the thing for downloading podcasts, sort of

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
TVercity, TVercity

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Didn't that do it?

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, that, that you can

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can stream stuff to your Xbox 360

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But not in the background while you're playing stuff

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I believe

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't know

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't know about that, maybe you can

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I thought one of them did internet radio

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Maybe you can do that with TVercity

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I know, I just use it for videos

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I don't really, I've never messed with the music part of it

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I know this would never ever happen

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But wouldn't it be nice if AllGames.com

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Could get one of those little channel things

109
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That you could install and have

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I mean, iHeartRadio, the Clear Channel thing has one

111
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I mean, they have millions and billions of dollars

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But AllGames totally has a 20 somewhere

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Maybe in the couch

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I mean, AllGames should be able to get that, right?

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Anyhow

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's see, Loki, we gotta do some catching up here

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You were out last week, and last week was the big show

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We were talking about our top games of 2011

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Because we never really had a proper year-end show

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because of the way the holidays fell this year

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And we all were speculating

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What is Loki's top three games of 2011?

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey, come on, it's gonna be super easy

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Dark Soccer and I guessed

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We actually, we already have a listener of mine

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think I remember, I remember three and one

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh yeah, yeah, I think, I don't remember

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Maybe one of the listeners will remind us in the chat room

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What we had picked, but I don't wanna say

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Because I don't wanna influence, so we'll wait

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Loki, let's hear your top three games

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So number three, what did you think was the third best game of 2011?

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You know, I don't know, because I didn't play a lot of games

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In 2011, sadly, because I just

135
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I was really playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto the whole

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, for the most part, up until recently

137
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But that's not, that didn't come out in 2011

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So that doesn't count

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We did allow, it was, the criteria was

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Your top game of the year

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And that might not actually be a game that came out this year

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Because so many good games come out at the end of 2010

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Or in Alan's case, he put Dragon Age Origins as his number two game of the year

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Because he just started playing it this year

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And we said, okay, you're allowed

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Every gamer gets their voice, even if it's a tardy voice

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, that's tough, and I would say

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto was pretty awesome

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And, I mean, it was nice to be able to play the mods again

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Briefly, until they patched it again

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I would say probably my number three would be

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare, I guess

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
All right, we called it

154
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Did we call it? I think we did, yeah

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, Modern Warfare

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's just fun now

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And especially because, you know, the whole reason we switched to that game

158
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Is because my co-workers were very pissed

159
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Or tired of me beating them in Grand Theft Auto

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And they're just like

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They're just like, oh, we gotta switch it up, we gotta play a game

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You know, my boss

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, I've played Call of Duty, you know

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think I should be a little bit better than Loki is at that

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Unfortunately, what they found out

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And, see, I didn't play a lot of Call of Duty at all

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I mean, I've literally, before we started playing it

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'd played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1 once

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Once split screen, and that was it

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And I didn't really care for it the first time we played it

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I ended up being really good at it, apparently

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And a lot better than them

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And they are pissed

174
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because it didn't help

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And it's actually been a lot worse now

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because I'm so stealthy in that game

177
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That I'll just sneak up behind them and do something funny

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And they'll be like, hey, hey

179
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And then kill them

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Alright, so you like this game because you can own the shit out of everybody

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's pretty fun

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's actually, Call of Duty, at least the Modern Warfare games and stuff

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I mean, they really cater that stuff

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Especially the multiplayer portion

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But they really have it down pat

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And it's smooth, it works well

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And it's just very fun and streamlined

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's good

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's not a series of games

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not really into the war games

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm terrible at first person shooters unless it's called Quake

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But you know what though

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And I agree, playing it online

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Like free for all deathmatch

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Not very fun

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Playing it team deathmatch online

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's a lot of fun

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well yeah, I watched

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I didn't talk about this last week

200
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But I actually watched over the holiday

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We were with some of Alan's family

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And some of his brothers were playing

203
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Modern Warfare 3

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And I was kind of watching them like, wow, it looks really good

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And they were doing this interesting playback thing

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Where he was showing us a video

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Where his whole team hid in a bus

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And the other team was looking for him everywhere

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And couldn't find him

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And it took him like 10 minutes or something

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
To find the team that was in the bus

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because this one guy inadvertently stood up

213
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I get why people are into this

214
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's actually a pretty fun game

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There's a lot of haters

216
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
A lot of hate for Modern Warfare

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I can't really speak for 2 and 3

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because I haven't played 2 and 3

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So I don't know how much they've changed

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I can only imagine it's about as much as they've changed

221
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
From Call of Duty 2 to 3

222
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Which wasn't a whole lot

223
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It was just pretty much

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They have the game and that's it

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I know a lot of it's catered towards multiplayer nowadays

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But you know what?

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's pretty fun

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I like what they were talking about

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That they were doing with the elite services

230
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can see where people would like that

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But my whole thing before was

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Just getting into online actually playing free for all death matches

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And stuff

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It doesn't seem very fun

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And I've actually played it

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And I don't know, there's still a lot of people cheating online

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You run into a lot of people running infection mods

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And stuff like that

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But Team Deathmatch actually doesn't seem to be plagued with that crap

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So it seems a lot more fun that way

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And I actually do pretty well

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Considering I'm ranked 5

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's pretty low

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When you consider there's 11

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, 11 prestigious

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Or 10 prestigious

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And you can level up again on 10th prestige

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And 55 levels per

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And people actually do level up

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not sure if everyone does it legitimately

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So it's fun

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's move on to your number 2 choice

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Number 2, best game of 2011

254
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's tough because this game

255
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
A couple weeks ago

256
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Might have been number 1

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But it's not

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because it's kind of like

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's kind of like an actual person

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sort of, Elder Scrolls Skyrim

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
2 for 2, Dark Sakura

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And the reason why

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Elder Scrolls Skyrim is number 2

264
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And not number 1

265
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Is because the longer you play it

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The worse it gets

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And it's not necessarily that the game is getting worse

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's just it's getting buggier

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's just it took an arrow to the knee

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's seriously getting buggier and buggier

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That meme needs to die right now

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Right now

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It needs to self inflict an arrow in its own knee

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I want to know why there's no representing the love

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
For, there's a guy that says

276
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He took a sword to the chest

277
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Huh? I don't see any sword to the chest

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, let me say arrow to the knees guy, you sound like a pussy

279
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sword to the chest?

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't come back from that

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He did apparently

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So

283
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, it's gotten progressively buggier

284
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
In fact I was complaining about it the other day on Facebook

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Um

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There's a quest I can't finish now because

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The NPC for the quest is spawned under the map

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And

289
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I can't get to them

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's literally in a spot that is inaccessible

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Alan got a pretty amazing bug this week

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I should have him come on and explain it

293
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm gonna butcher this

294
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Hopefully he hears, oh here he comes, yeah

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Alan hears me struggling

296
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What kind of Skyrim bug you got this week?

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So when I go to

298
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Whiterun, which is the main city in the center

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The first major city you go to

300
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm not a criminal

301
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't have a bounty

302
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I could talk to guards, they're like, oh hey sup bro

303
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Like you're orcish armor

304
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I go into Dragon's Reach where the Jarl is

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And right when I go up the stairs

306
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The Jarl and his bodyguard are like

307
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh shit, get him

308
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And like the whole room agros

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And I'm like, I'm dead, I didn't do anything

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I left

311
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And I just did other shit for like 8 hours

312
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And I went back

313
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And it's fine

314
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's fine now, so I can use the enchanting table in there

315
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I was like, that was weird

316
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Magically fixed itself, fantastic

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I love this comment in our chat room

318
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Zenthral says, the guy that invented that mem

319
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The arrow to the knee thing, needs to take a sack to the chin

320
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The arrow to the knee thing, yeah

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We get it, the NPCs

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Repeat themselves a lot

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hell, I mean all the shopkeeps say the same thing too

325
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Some consider this trash

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I consider them treasures

327
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well considering how fucking vast that game is though

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I mean

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know

330
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's just

331
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's

332
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's getting incredibly buggy

333
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And to the point where it's actually breaking the game

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But I mean

335
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's still fun, I'm still playing

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I had to kind of force myself not to play this week

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I can get some other stuff done

338
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Because I have over 85 hours in the game now

339
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And although I have exploited pretty much every glitch possible in the game

340
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
To level myself up to the point where I can't die anymore

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I kill everything in one hit

342
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And it's still fun

343
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I can sneak up right to somebody in plain daylight

344
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And be standing right in front of them and they can't see me

345
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Which is kind of fun

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But yeah, the fact that I can't finish that quest

347
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That sucks, and the fact that sometimes

348
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Parts of the land don't spawn

349
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And I can't, you know, I fall through them

350
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Or uh

351
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Other fun stuff, oh

352
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Sometimes when you kill a dragon or whatever

353
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It'll do one more lap around the sky and then crash epically

354
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You know, it's just like

355
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Really? You have to do that

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You can just die and fall to the ground

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Alright, so despite all the crappy bugs

358
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's still your number two game of the year because

359
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I played it a lot

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I'm still playing

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Alright, your number one game of twenty

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I mean, come on

363
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Seriously, you gotta ask

364
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What is your number one game of 2011?

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's say it's World of the Third

366
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ah, three for three, right there

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Actually, didn't we go back and say though

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That Earth Defense Force was gonna end up number three?

369
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, but then we allowed the old game rule

370
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, alright

371
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
See, if it wasn't the old game rule

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I probably would have been number three

373
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Only by default because

374
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They sucked

375
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And Earth Defense Force, it was all right

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was pretty fun for a while, but man

377
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's pretty boring now

378
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They promised, oh, we're gonna deal with this TLC

379
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's gonna be so fucking awesome

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And nothing

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why Saints Row the Third?

382
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's such an over the top game

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's just incredibly fun

384
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It was everything I wanted that game to be

385
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And more

386
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Honestly, I wanna finish it

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And get all a thousand achievement points

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But I just, once again, there's

389
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
A buggy portion of the game

390
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And it happens to be kind of like the terrible part of it

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Where you have to do these car jacking things

392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And steal certain cars

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
To unlock stuff

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's on their Saints book thing

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's just broken

396
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And if it wasn't broken

397
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I probably would be done with that

398
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, with all the achievements at least

399
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Sad there wasn't any competitive multiplayer in it

400
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I mean, that's kinda lame

401
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I do really wanna play the

402
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Co-op in it

403
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think that would be pretty fun

404
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I do have to play through it again now

405
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
As a woman so I can get the other achievements

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And the DLC

407
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm looking forward to it

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Although I'm not too optimistic

409
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
On if it being really good

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Cause the new, like from the achievements

411
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That were leaked out for the

412
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Upcoming stuff

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It just sounds like a bunch of extra excursions

414
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And some of it, I mean, that would probably be pretty fun

415
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But, you know

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The activities

417
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's cool doing them sometimes

418
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But I don't like being forced to doing them

419
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I would rather have some actual missions to the game

420
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But it just sounds like it's all activities

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So, we'll try it

422
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I mean, it'll be alright

423
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But I'm not gonna be one of those persons

424
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I haven't been

425
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm not gonna be one to buy every single piece of download content

426
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Just because I like the game

427
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's not how I'm gonna do it

428
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Alright, so you're number one game of the year

429
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Number three, and then you proceeded to slam each game

430
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There it is, your top three

431
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Of the year

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Can you get, Dark Soccer and I

433
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Have the same game as number one, can you guess?

434
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The same game as number one

435
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
World of Warcraft?

436
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No

437
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Good guess though

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Star Wars the old

439
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No, I'm not playing that

440
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I showed Dark Soccer it for five minutes

441
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And she was like, I don't get it

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No, I got it, I just didn't really care

443
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Number one game

444
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Better not be something like The Sims Social

445
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No, God no

446
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Think more, it'll be easier to guess her

447
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Here's a clue

448
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, it's you

449
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How have you been?

450
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I've been really busy being dead

451
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh my God, I forgot Portal 2

452
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Fuck that, Call of Duty is out of this

453
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
See, that's what happens when that comes out way too early

454
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Call of Duty, fuck it

455
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Move them all back

456
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Portal 2 number one, all the rest can be

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Skyrim number three

458
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Saints Row the Third

459
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So there we go, so after

460
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Some coercing, we finally get Loki to agree

461
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So it's official, the official OLR game of 2011

462
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Is Portal 2

463
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I played through that game what, four times all the way through?

464
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's great

465
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I completely forgot that that game came out

466
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This year, and that's really bad

467
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Because I think a lot of the

468
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Game of the Year stuff, I mean a lot of people

469
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Talked about Portal 2, but

470
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I literally forgot that that came out this year

471
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, and you know

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I actually have that, oh, it's you

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Memorized very well, because that's my

474
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Message tone on my phone now

475
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, so I mean, yeah, Portal 2

476
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
For sure

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I completely forgot

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I feel so bad

479
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But seriously, where the fuck is

480
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Where the fuck is some DLC for that?

481
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
They had some of the stuff on the PC

482
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Any other guesses

483
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What might have been on our list?

484
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Technically

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Um

486
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Final Fantasy XIV

487
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hell to the no

488
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That would be in like three biggest

489
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Disappointments of the year

490
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Super Mario 3D Land

491
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You got it, it was my number three

492
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Mario Kart 7

493
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Arkham City was my number two

494
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Arkham City was my number three

495
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What was your number two? I forgot

496
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Um

497
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hold on, I actually have

498
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
No, I

499
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll have to check on my hard drive

500
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Because I

501
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Spazinator says the number one game was Singstar Abba

502
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
L-O-O-J-K

503
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I know what my, um

504
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Wrong, it's not Singstar Abba, it's Abba, you can dance

505
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He was so hilarious playing that

506
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No, but they also have Singstar Abba on the PS3

507
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I know that

508
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I remember that Tiara was in town when you got that

509
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And we came and played it at the old house

510
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But, um

511
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I know what my honorable

512
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Mention was, Fractal

513
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Because that game is cool

514
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Fractal is a really neat puzzler

515
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Alright, oh Marvel vs. Capcom

516
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah, Marvel vs. Capcom

517
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

518
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It just hit me, all of a sudden

519
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Alright, let's

520
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Uh, quickly, our intro is running a little long

521
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I wanted to just quickly say something about this

522
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Because, Loki, you tweeted it to me

523
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've had listeners tweet me more stories

524
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
About this whole Xbox hacking stuff

525
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And, god, we've been talking to our

526
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Blue in the face about it since August

527
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You know, if you don't know by now

528
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Uh, I was hacked back in August

529
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And people were saying, oh, you let

530
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Your password get out, oh, you got phish

531
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Microsoft's saying, oh, you got phish, I'm like, no

532
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm a little smarter than that in the websites I visit

533
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But, no, apparently it was my own damn fault

534
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, now that more and more people are getting hacked

535
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And more and more people are having problems with Microsoft

536
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Finally, it's getting out there, some gal has set up a Tumblr

537
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Where she was sharing her experiences

538
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
For some reason, it caught wildfire

539
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And I think a lot of it is because

540
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
She had screen caps with Xbox support

541
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
She was screen capping the emails

542
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it gave a lot of the gaming press, I guess, for whatever reason

543
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They're really, really bored

544
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What really was taking me off this week

545
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And you linked me an article from IGN

546
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That literally said nothing

547
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Literally said nothing, it said, yeah

548
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Xbox is claiming that they're getting hacked

549
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But, Microsoft says

550
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
They have no comment on the situation

551
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So, you know

552
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And apparently

553
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This guy on this website

554
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Was the first to break the news

555
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
A couple weeks ago, and it's like

556
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's kind of insulting

557
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When we were here in August, talking about

558
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm not saying we should, that's not what I'm saying

559
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because there were probably way other people

560
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Before me, in fact I know people who were hacked

561
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Before me

562
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's just irritating

563
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That it's not news until it happens to somebody

564
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Who has

565
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Listen, just because a dude works in an office

566
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
For a company that makes a lot of money

567
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Doesn't mean he's any better than any other blogger

568
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I mean, there's a lot of really stupid ass posts

569
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That are on a lot of major websites

570
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
IGN

571
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Especially

572
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That have not a lot of research in there

573
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And, I mean, I think they got

574
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The comment from, what is it

575
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Steven Toulouse, or whatever his name is

576
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Support, I don't know what the hell he is

577
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Something that Xbox put

578
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That customer service related

579
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm not going to touch on Blowing the Fate

580
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Go listen to that last show from 2011

581
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Episode number four

582
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
How old night are we on tonight?

583
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
441

584
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Go listen to 439

585
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Would have been the last one from, we had Justin on

586
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Who was talking about how he got

587
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Broken into twice

588
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Go, I mean, that's really all you need to hear

589
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I don't want to keep talking about this

590
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But seriously, if you have not changed your password

591
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
At this point, do not

592
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Microsoft is swearing up and down

593
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That they're doing everything

594
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They're being ignorant

595
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's really the only word

596
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Microsoft is ignorant

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
EA is ignorant

598
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The higher ups in those companies are ignorant

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
To the situation that's going on right now

600
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Your money is at risk if your credit card is on your account

601
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I have been sitting here telling you this

602
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Blue in the face since August

603
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Change your F and password, it's not that hard to do

604
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Use a unique password on Xbox

605
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That you don't use anywhere else

606
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Put, like, put XB at the end of it

607
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Or something, or put, you know

608
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
MS with a dollar sign

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Just make something that differentiates it

610
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
For the record, neither of us have been hacked

611
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's, it's, the thing is though

612
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Is, once again, they

613
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Um, but

614
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They're right, and they're wrong at the same time

615
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think Dan always paid with points cards

616
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And also, hundreds and thousands

617
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Of people have been, you know

618
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And including people I know that haven't touched

619
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Their Xboxes in forever

620
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, I'm just saying it's safer to

621
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Pay with points cards

622
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The only card I have ever had on there

623
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Was one that I knew was gonna expire in a month that I wasn't

624
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Gonna renew

625
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I would still change your password

626
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You might have people in there downloading

627
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What they can do, they can transfer

628
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
They might not charge anything, but what a lot of them

629
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Have been doing, have they been logging

630
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In and then downloading the licenses

631
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
To their local Xboxes

632
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And basically siphoning all your games

633
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Which can cause you headaches later on

634
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm just saying

635
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, I've checked all my licenses and they're still on mine

636
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But I've also never had gold on my

637
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Account either

638
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Now, Microsoft's not

639
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I wouldn't say they're ignorant

640
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But what their statement is true

641
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's just, okay

642
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Here's what it is

643
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They're saying basically two things

644
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
One, Live.com has not been compromised

645
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And two, that

646
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
People are being phished

647
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And that's how their

648
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Credentials are being

649
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Leaked out or compromised

650
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There's two things that are

651
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I mean, yes, true

652
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They are not

653
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Live.com is not compromised

654
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But people are not being phished

655
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The whole thing was

656
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
All this stuff is coming from the hacks

657
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That happened a while back and I even think it was

658
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The anonymous stuff where they were dumping

659
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
A bunch of, and it might not even necessarily

660
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Be them, but something similar to

661
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The fact where they dump the email passwords

662
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Combos

663
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
From random forums

664
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Or even gaming websites or whatever

665
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
EA may have even been one of those, I don't know

666
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think EA is the weak link

667
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And I've been saying this for forever

668
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Why does every single hack seem to come back

669
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
To one of the EA games

670
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And I get FIFA 12's gold pack thing

671
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Where they're taking the cards and trading with other accounts

672
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That whole thing, I get that

673
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But why, if

674
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
All these accounts are being sold on a Polish

675
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Website or all these accounts

676
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Are being bought and sold on there

677
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Why are they not selling accounts

678
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
With other games too

679
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Why does it always come back to FIFA

680
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Because FIFA is a popular game

681
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
In other countries

682
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
There's other popular games in other countries

683
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Why is it always freaking FIFA

684
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But the DLC for FIFA is a lot more

685
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Expensive than buying a map pack for Call of Duty

686
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Or something

687
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Where there's smoke there's fire and it seems like

688
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
FIFA is the common thing between

689
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
All this, there's something about that game

690
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Or EA servers that are allowing this to happen

691
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
EA sells a lot of garbage DLC

692
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
People buy it

693
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And it's worth more

694
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's really what it's coming down to

695
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But it doesn't matter

696
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You should be using a unique password

697
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And email combination

698
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
On Xbox

699
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That's pretty much what

700
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You have to do

701
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Let's assume that even

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Right now they're claiming

703
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Phishing

704
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What evidence do they have that there's actual phishing

705
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Going on? They have no evidence

706
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They're just making assumptions

707
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because all they know is

708
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's gotta be phishing

709
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But what they should do is

710
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Listen, hey, you know

711
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I think I've seen one of them say that

712
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Someone that was associated with

713
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Xbox said, hey, you know

714
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
There were these hacks that happened

715
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A lot of this email password

716
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Combos got out

717
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And what they're doing

718
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
In fact, Anonymous said to do this

719
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
When they leaked this crap out

720
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Try it in Facebook, try it in Yahoo

721
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Try it in Gmail, try it in Twitter

722
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Use these login credentials

723
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
To get in access to other people's stuff

724
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Because these people should be changing their accounts

725
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because these websites got hacked

726
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So that's what it is

727
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You need to change that stuff

728
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Because if you use the same email

729
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And password combination

730
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Or even username password

731
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
For every single website that you visit

732
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Then you're gonna

733
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
If someone gets one of those, they've got them all

734
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Alright, so again

735
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We've spent way too much time talking about this

736
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In the past on the show

737
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
If you tweet me and say

738
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
My Xbox got hacked, I'm gonna tweet you back

739
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And say, I'm really sorry to hear that

740
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But I told you to change your password in August

741
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Now if you tweet me back and say, I changed my password

742
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Back in August, I really do want to hear those

743
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because then that would prove

744
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Something fishy's going on

745
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm not talking fishing

746
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But if you haven't

747
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Changed your password by now

748
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know what else to tell you

749
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Like, the evidence is out there

750
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's growing

751
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And finally, the mainstream press

752
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Is coming around

753
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And telling you to change your password too

754
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So just do it

755
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Even though Microsoft and EA and all of them are refusing to admit there's a problem

756
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's clear that there's a problem

757
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Alright

758
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's see

759
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Moving on

760
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I want to talk about our gaming weeks

761
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And we always like to start off the show

762
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Even when it's really 30 minutes into the show

763
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Talking about what video games have you been playing this week

764
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
There's been things that you've been playing

765
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
DarkSakura, what have you been up to?

766
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Well, I have been playing WoW

767
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But I've been reading books

768
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
WoW books

769
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And I was at Goodwill

770
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Someone had the first two books of the War of the Ancients series

771
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I was like, I'm kind of a lore nerd

772
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'll read them

773
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
They're really well written

774
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I mean, I can

775
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
A lot of books that you get that are tie-ins to series

776
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Are kind of like, oh meh

777
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
These are actually really good books

778
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And that's just reading it

779
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You know, in between times

780
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Really good books

781
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I also

782
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Played some Fractal

783
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And I installed Bastion

784
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I haven't played it yet

785
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But it's really been Fractal and WoW

786
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And we picked up DJ Hero 2 today

787
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The girl installed the game

788
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But she couldn't find the time

789
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We got DJ Hero 2 today

790
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The bundle set

791
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
For 20 bucks at Big Lots

792
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So that's what tomorrow was

793
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Woohoo bargaining

794
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I know, right

795
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I've also been playing Scare Shermie

796
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Which was

797
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I finally figured out how to sneak up on Shermie

798
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Vacuum something in front of her

799
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
She's too busy staring at it

800
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
In absolute horror

801
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You can actually sneak up on her

802
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And she'll jump

803
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I think I saw a tweet

804
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Or a chat comment or something earlier

805
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That said, I miss Shermie

806
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
There are two cats here

807
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
In this studio, but they're afraid of people

808
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They like to run and hide

809
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So they're currently probably under my bed

810
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Maruko loves me

811
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, but they don't know Loki

812
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And so they're probably like, who's that guy

813
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Maruko was sitting next to me, cuddling

814
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
While I was reading

815
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He walks around with his tail in the air, showing off his butt

816
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Look at my butt

817
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And

818
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I was getting the occasional stink eye

819
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
From Sanrio

820
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, mostly, and I was reading those books here

821
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
By the way, reading them here

822
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And looking at your video games, seeing which ones I was gonna run off with

823
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Not really

824
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I was out of town, by the way, Disneyland

825
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Mostly, it's just been

826
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That we've still been arranging a lot of stuff from the move

827
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So we haven't had

828
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
A significant amount of time

829
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Also, the issues with my hand are getting worse again

830
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So I can't really sit down

831
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And play for very long

832
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?

833
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Well

834
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This week I didn't really play much

835
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Because I play Call of Duty at work

836
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Which is fine

837
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Like I said, my coworkers are trying

838
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Multiple ways to get me to

839
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Not be as good

840
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Including, as of Friday

841
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
They taped a piece of cardboard

842
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
To my monitor with a few random holes poked in it

843
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And of course, you know

844
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Blocking about 90% of the monitor

845
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I still managed to stealth kill

846
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
A few people with a knife doing that

847
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But yeah, I could not aim and shoot

848
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
At anybody because there was nothing in the direct center

849
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So it made it very difficult to

850
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Try to actually shoot somebody

851
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Um

852
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And then, um

853
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's see what else

854
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh, and I played Skyrim

855
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Earlier in the week

856
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But I, you know, stopped

857
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Playing it this week just so I could get some

858
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Other stuff done because every time I'm like

859
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Well, I could work on this, or I could play Skyrim

860
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I want to play Skyrim

861
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And

862
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I started going through

863
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Some of the Thief Guild stuff

864
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I started a

865
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Quest in Winterhold

866
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And

867
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It crashed

868
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, the quest crashed because

869
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Apparently if you do something out of order in that

870
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Quest, it breaks

871
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You know, something that would be very obvious

872
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
To anybody that tested the game

873
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But I don't think anybody tested the game

874
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Or there's too damn much to test

875
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That's also probably part of the problem

876
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There's too much damn stuff to test

877
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But you would think that the first things they would test

878
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Would be, I don't know, the quest from the game

879
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I mean, obviously

880
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They can't test

881
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
If you step on this rock over here

882
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And you get launched into space

883
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Or something like that, because there's a lot of

884
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Landmass to go wander around and test

885
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Every single random event that would happen

886
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But I would think an actual quest

887
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
In the game

888
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Um, it would be very obvious

889
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That it's not working correctly

890
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But I don't care

891
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't have to finish that quest

892
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm not a necessarily completionist in this case

893
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But it's just still annoying though

894
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That something like that would break

895
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I mean, I don't mind if like

896
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You know, a

897
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
A character gets trapped in a wall or something like that

898
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Okay, I did mind that a little bit

899
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And I had to reload a few times, but

900
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It's just, it's getting to the point now

901
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Where I'm actually starting to get the

902
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Frame stutters and stuff like that

903
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Like, it's stopping

904
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Going, stopping, and going

905
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I have to stop moving for a second

906
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
For it to catch up

907
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's not good, that's the PS3 crap

908
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That, you know, is going on right now

909
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I think I might try to get back into some Skyrim this week

910
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We'll see, because I've kind of, I'm a little

911
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
MMO'd out right now

912
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But I'll get to my own week in a minute

913
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes we do

914
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That would make WoW more interesting

915
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And I'm not really sure if we want to talk about it right now

916
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But I've also, like I told you

917
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That I've been, my coworkers

918
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Have been finding ways to try to

919
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Hinder my gameplay in Call of Duty

920
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Let me set this up a little bit

921
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Because this is one of the stories we didn't talk about

922
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
A lot last week, because it seemed like it was everywhere

923
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And it's not really a story

924
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It was really something that caught

925
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Fire in a non-news

926
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Week, I mean, yes, the

927
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Guy was an idiot, but it was just

928
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That guy got taken to the cleaners

929
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It was just like, really? This is how bored

930
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We are, but it's

931
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Obviously we're talking about the ocean marketing thing

932
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And the whole controller that they were promoting

933
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Was the Avenger

934
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Now, I think we can all separate the controller

935
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
From the situation

936
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And this one guy with the ego

937
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
However, ironically enough

938
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Loki had procured a copy

939
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Of this controller

940
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We've had one of these for months now

941
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And was ready to review it on the show

942
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
When this all happened

943
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So, Loki, go ahead, the Avenger controller now

944
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay, the Avenger controller

945
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's basically, I mean

946
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Different spins I've heard on it

947
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
One, yes, it's created by a guy

948
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I think he was a teacher or something like that

949
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And his reasoning behind it

950
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Was, oh, I wanted to make

951
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Something that made games a little bit

952
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
More accessible for

953
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
People with disabilities or something like that

954
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Because he knew somebody that had trouble

955
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
With a range of motion or something like that

956
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So they had

957
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Issues reaching

958
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The buttons or something

959
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't know what the case may be

960
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But that said, though, the way they're

961
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Marketing it is not necessarily

962
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You know, oh, this is for people

963
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That have disabilities

964
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Or, oh, yeah, and if you have disabilities

965
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That would be good, too, but no

966
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's supposed to be something that actually

967
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Decreases the amount of

968
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Latency

969
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Between your reaction

970
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And hitting the buttons

971
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And the way they do that is by putting these

972
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Extra arms above

973
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The

974
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
X, Y, and

975
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
B buttons

976
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
These arms reach out over

977
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Behind the trigger and kind of

978
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
On the middle of your finger

979
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
For the B button as well

980
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Am I doing this right? I'm holding this right now

981
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You kind of lift up?

982
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah, you're supposed to lift up and it's supposed to hit the button

983
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's a little interesting

984
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You can adjust those arms, too

985
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Because that's adjusted for me right now

986
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You're supposed to hit up

987
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And then for the triggers now

988
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You can see on the triggers

989
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There's a rubber band thing that goes underneath the bottom

990
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You're supposed to pull up on the bottom

991
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
With your finger to pull the trigger

992
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Because the way they have it

993
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's tightened to the point now where

994
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's just to the point where

995
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's going to trigger the actual

996
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Button

997
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
On the actual trigger

998
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's supposed to cut down

999
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The amount of time it takes you

1000
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
To

1001
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Press the trigger buttons

1002
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It doesn't make you better in games

1003
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Because you're hitting buttons faster

1004
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And your reaction time is faster

1005
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That's all good on paper

1006
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But it doesn't work that way, unfortunately

1007
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Because you have to retrain yourself

1008
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
To play games

1009
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And it's actually very fucking awkward

1010
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
To play with that

1011
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It was harder to play Call of Duty

1012
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And I gave it

1013
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I think I gave it a fair amount of time

1014
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'd say a total of about

1015
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
About five hours worth of gameplay

1016
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That I played during lunches

1017
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
On Call of Duty with that

1018
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I played during our

1019
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Morning and afternoon

1020
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And deathmatch games and stuff like that

1021
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I still was alright

1022
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But it was just a hassle

1023
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Especially trying to trigger certain buttons

1024
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And I don't really

1025
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I mean, Call of Duty

1026
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't think a lot of people really need to hit

1027
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The face buttons fast

1028
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because it's like, reload

1029
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, okay, reload

1030
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Or like switching weapons or crouching

1031
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You don't really need that

1032
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm really curious, though, about the

1033
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So obviously you just find it awkward

1034
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And I gotta admit, when I'm holding it

1035
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't really play shooters, though

1036
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
For me, this would not be an advantage

1037
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But accessibility is a big thing

1038
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
About this dark soccer

1039
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm really curious what you think

1040
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Having your hand issues

1041
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's really my first two fingers

1042
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And the things that

1043
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I really don't like all this crap on top of it

1044
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But I like the two extensions

1045
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
On the triggers

1046
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And you see how there's a rubber bandy thing?

1047
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You can also tug on that

1048
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And that triggers it, too

1049
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But this actually is much more comfortable

1050
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
To my finger because I don't have to

1051
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Have it up and put my hand in an awkward position

1052
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The whole problem I have with the triggers

1053
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Is that

1054
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I have to move my hand

1055
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Much higher up to reach them

1056
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And if I had something that

1057
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Would work for

1058
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The top two triggers instead of the back one

1059
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Like this long piece

1060
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It would be very comfortable for me

1061
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So like a half Avenger would be really good

1062
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
For dark soccer?

1063
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Well, unfortunately, the part that you can take off the Avenger

1064
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Are the actual trigger buttons

1065
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't know what they call them, paddles

1066
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Or whatever the hell on the back there

1067
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Those are the things you can take off

1068
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
If you don't like

1069
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Pulling on the actual skis

1070
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Or whatever the hell that's called

1071
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Derek H. in our chatroom at chat.orangesonshade.com

1072
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Says, Loki should tape three of his fingers together

1073
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
To simulate how it is supposed to be used

1074
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So

1075
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Honestly, it's a waste of money

1076
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
To be honest

1077
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I think I want one

1078
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
My opinion is it's a waste of money

1079
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
See, it's very, very interesting

1080
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So like for you

1081
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The normal controller doesn't bug you

1082
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But for her, she's like

1083
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Okay, now I can see maybe something that might

1084
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let me play games a little longer

1085
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You should just give her yours

1086
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But here's the thing though

1087
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Jamie, you're having trouble hitting some of the

1088
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
These would need to be adjusted

1089
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay, but the buttons that you have trouble

1090
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Hitting are the shoulder buttons, right?

1091
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah

1092
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay, well they have controllers that have

1093
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Remappable buttons that would be on the bottom

1094
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Of the controller that you would hit with

1095
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
One of your middle fingers

1096
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You drop Siri

1097
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
On the

1098
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
On this controller

1099
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's just the problem is

1100
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
$50 first off

1101
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
For not a controller

1102
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
They call it a controller, it's not a fucking controller

1103
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's a piece of shit that attaches to a controller

1104
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
If it were a controller, I would be able to take this off

1105
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And play with just this

1106
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And it would work just fine

1107
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
$50 for that's a little steep

1108
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I mean, and really

1109
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I understand that there could be uses for it

1110
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
As far as

1111
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
People

1112
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Like they said right here

1113
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The rocker

1114
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
They said players with larger or smaller hands

1115
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
May utilize the rocker for added

1116
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Comfort

1117
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
With smaller or larger hands

1118
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What's it meant for? I mean, I don't understand

1119
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Comes equipped with an

1120
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Optional stabilizing stand

1121
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Tension straps and trigger skis

1122
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
These are called trigger skis apparently

1123
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And they suck, they do not work

1124
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I've tried pulling the trigger using this

1125
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It does not work, I mean

1126
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Really what would make the controller

1127
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
In general better for me

1128
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Is just to extend the top to where the two triggers

1129
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Are further back

1130
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
They have also these

1131
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Sticker things that I pulled off of here already

1132
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Because I'm planning on reselling this

1133
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Because it's a piece of shit

1134
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
They had one that plucked

1135
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And that's the other thing too

1136
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You'll notice that there's actually the triggers for all the buttons

1137
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Except for the A button

1138
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You still have to move your thumb off of here

1139
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
To push jump

1140
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And it's recessed because now there's this hunk of garbage

1141
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
On top of the controller

1142
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
To hit the A button

1143
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So their solution is there's a sticky pad

1144
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That you can put on top of there

1145
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So not worth the price at all

1146
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's not worth the price

1147
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But maybe an accessibility thing

1148
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Maybe if you have issues

1149
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You might want to try one

1150
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Honestly I think it could be done better

1151
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
If it's an accessibility thing I think it could be done better

1152
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And if you're having trouble hitting

1153
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
If you want something that's gonna hit these

1154
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Face buttons or whatever

1155
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'd recommend if you're playing Call of Duty

1156
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
They had one either for Modern Warfare 2

1157
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Or Black Ops

1158
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
They had a controller with two

1159
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It was from Mad Catz with two buttons on the bottom

1160
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That were mappable to either the

1161
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Left stick, right stick, or L3, R3

1162
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And then the four face buttons

1163
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And you can hit those buttons

1164
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
On the bottom

1165
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Using, I guess it would be

1166
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Let me see here

1167
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It would be probably with your middle finger

1168
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
To hit those buttons on the bottom

1169
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And that's actually not too bad

1170
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Because the comfort goes

1171
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So that would be my recommendation

1172
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And that, for 50 bucks, you actually get a controller

1173
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
That you can use straight out of the box and go

1174
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
This is $50

1175
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Plus you have to have a $60

1176
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Controller to plug it on top of

1177
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So it's $110

1178
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And I love their website

1179
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And this is another reason for me to hate G4

1180
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But I love their website

1181
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Because they have a bunch of different

1182
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Reviews on it

1183
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And one of them was from G4

1184
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
This and the controller from Evil Controllers

1185
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Which is ironic because this controller

1186
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I have in here is a modded controller

1187
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
From Evil Controllers

1188
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yes, and they're fucking expensive

1189
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So I don't recommend buying them because it's not

1190
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You can get it way cheaper and stuff

1191
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But they're still nice

1192
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They're like

1193
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Their review

1194
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And this is Adam Sessler on fucking X-Play

1195
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Their review was

1196
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We don't like the Evil Controllers because

1197
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The rapid fire controller is cheating

1198
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well if you guys like cheating then

1199
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
That was their negative

1200
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Review for Evil Controllers

1201
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
But we like this Avenger one because it's not cheating

1202
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That was the reason they liked it

1203
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So there's

1204
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Your educated

1205
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Review for that

1206
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Interesting side though, did you hear

1207
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
G4 has a new president now

1208
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It has to do with the whole Comcast

1209
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
G4 is a Comcast network and the whole

1210
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Comcast NBC thing that's happening

1211
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Interesting

1212
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Because

1213
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
They were trying to pull

1214
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
With a lot of the stuff

1215
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Well you know

1216
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The Avenger was

1217
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It was meant for people with

1218
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Disabilities and stuff and they tried to swing

1219
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That whole emotional like

1220
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I've got to feel sorry for them and stuff

1221
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
They donated a child's play and stuff

1222
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Because of this whole bad PR and the fact that

1223
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
They still haven't delivered these pieces of shit controllers

1224
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah I got one of these months ago so they were done

1225
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
They just haven't manufactured them

1226
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I mean it's fucking plastic

1227
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So I don't know why it's taking so long

1228
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And that's

1229
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And that's the way that they were marketing it

1230
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Except the problem is

1231
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's not Avenger

1232
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The controller to allow

1233
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
All gamers to play games

1234
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Including those with disabilities

1235
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Avenger! The ultimate gaming advantage

1236
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And no I'm sorry it's not an advantage

1237
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's actually quite a disadvantage and I seriously

1238
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I would recommend

1239
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You know what if you're going to spend a lot of money on controllers

1240
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Buy a professionally modded controller

1241
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Or you know those actual

1242
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The Mad Catz ones and they have the

1243
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Ones for the major league gamers

1244
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Or whatever that actually looked pretty cool

1245
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And so I'd pick up one of the nicer

1246
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Controllers instead of a $50 piece of crap

1247
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Alright

1248
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's enough clearly we know how you feel

1249
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
About that Loki so that's enough

1250
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Alright I gave it a fair share I mean

1251
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I played for that for five hours and trust me

1252
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I did not want to play for that

1253
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You know long a time with that controller

1254
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Which is terrible

1255
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Alright my gaming week quickly I don't have a lot to really add

1256
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Because there hasn't really been any new games to come out

1257
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So it's been basically more

1258
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Sweat Tour, Star Wars The Old Republic

1259
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And Warcraft of course

1260
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Because that's every week

1261
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Randomly got an urge to play Super Mario World

1262
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Am I weird?

1263
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I have a Super Nintendo sitting right there in a Mario World cart

1264
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yet I've been playing it on the Wii

1265
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I've been playing on the Wii with the classic controller

1266
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And I've been doing that because you can

1267
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Remember in Mario World you can only save after you beat

1268
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Like a ghost house or a fortress

1269
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But thanks to Wii save states

1270
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Not really save states but you can just kind of hit the home button

1271
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Anywhere and it remembers right where you're at

1272
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So that's pretty cool

1273
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah so I've been playing that just old school

1274
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
A little bit and finally tried PVP

1275
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
In Sweat Tour

1276
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And it was actually really fun I love the commentators

1277
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh my god that part was really funny

1278
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
As you're playing there's actually live commentators

1279
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Like you know oh they just killed

1280
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
A guy on the frog pants team

1281
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They took him down it was just really funny

1282
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Is Greg Proops in there again?

1283
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
No it's not Greg Proops

1284
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Such a missed opportunity I mean he's not doing anything

1285
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The frog knobs or something

1286
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I don't know the teams have funny names

1287
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
What's he doing now he's like hosting some like

1288
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Some weird news on Yahoo

1289
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Or something like that I mean come on

1290
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The guy's not doing anything right now

1291
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
No no no he's got his podcast it's great

1292
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Smartest man in the world I would endorse that podcast

1293
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I have to say I listened to it in Rob's car

1294
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
He can squeeze out some more voice work

1295
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
For a game come on

1296
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Come on just throw some money his way he'd do it

1297
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Alright um

1298
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Let's see so that was really my gaming week

1299
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We've been going on a long time

1300
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We gotta get into housekeeping real real quick

1301
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Now I have to admit I'm changing my tone

1302
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Here a little bit because I was about to come on here

1303
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And really point the finger and shake it

1304
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
At the listeners because we have not had a lot

1305
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Of people signing up for the big battle

1306
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Over at thebigbattle.net

1307
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000

OLR alright

Alright let's get into

1362
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Tonight's news Loki why don't you start

1363
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Us off alright let's talk a little

1364
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Bit about Atari

1365
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And some of their

1366
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I guess witch hunts

1367
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Over

1368
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Infringing

1369
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
IOS games apparently they're going after

1370
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Everybody that has games that look like theirs

1371
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And whether that you know they're just

1372
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
A blatant rip off of like say

1373
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Asteroids or Breakout or something like that

1374
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Or if it just happens to be you know

1375
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
A tank game with vector tanks you know

1376
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
In fact

1377
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
One indie app creator

1378
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Black Powder Media

1379
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
They have a game

1380
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That's been pulled

1381
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Off of the

1382
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
App store because of

1383
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Claims from Atari of

1384
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Copyright infringement of course their game

1385
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Is very similar I guess it looks

1386
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Similar to Battlezone

1387
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Vector tanks is the game

1388
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And apparently

1389
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
They're going after everybody

1390
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And you know Atari

1391
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You know release the same instance

1392
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
For companies like Atari our intellectual property

1393
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Portfolio is our

1394
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Most valued asset

1395
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
While we have a great respect for any

1396
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Development community and greatly appreciate

1397
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
The enthusiasm that they have for

1398
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Our renowned properties we need to vigorously

1399
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Protect our intellectual property

1400
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And ensure that it's represented

1401
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
In a highly innovative

1402
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Represent highly innovative

1403
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Games okay well I gotta stop I'm right there

1404
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Highly innovative games I'm sorry

1405
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Your remake of centipede

1406
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
What is it the last the one that came out

1407
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
In the fall

1408
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Last year it's terrible

1409
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And not innovative in the least and

1410
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
What test drive Ferrari

1411
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That's innovative to the you know test

1412
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Drive franchise I'm sorry

1413
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That's not true this is a

1414
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Slippery slope though because like I

1415
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I want to say okay yeah I

1416
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Get it we see these knockoff games

1417
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
On the iOS devices and especially

1418
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Android stuff all the time but

1419
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Where do you draw the line because if you think

1420
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
About it couldn't any

1421
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Shoot them up game any

1422
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
First person shooter couldn't anything

1423
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Come back to combat

1424
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
If you really think about it

1425
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Well like see I have a problem with

1426
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The fact that you know okay it's a vector

1427
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Game that has tanks in it I'm sorry

1428
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
But even I think in the arcades they had

1429
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
More than just battle zone I remember

1430
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I remember an awesome

1431
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
PC game awesome awesome PC

1432
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Game called specter that was

1433
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Like a vector tank game but it was

1434
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It was not I mean

1435
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It was not battle zone like

1436
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It was a step I remember the big thing about it

1437
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Is you could do modem play and all this stuff which was huge

1438
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You know when I was growing up and the whole reason

1439
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
They're doing this of course is because

1440
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Because they have their own games that they're

1441
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Releasing on the iOS marketplace

1442
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And that's what it really comes down to I think

1443
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Is that they just want to release it and

1444
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Actually get some money for it but

1445
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I mean let's be

1446
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Serious here you know like Arkanoid

1447
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And stuff like that I mean which Arkanoid isn't really

1448
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
There's actually was it Breakout

1449
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Taito was

1450
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But Breakout I mean that's

1451
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Pretty much like Arkanoid

1452
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Well Arkanoid is just a souped up

1453
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Version of Breakout if you will

1454
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's got the falling things that you pick up

1455
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
That change the paddle

1456
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I would say that that's more of like a genre

1457
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Of games now less

1458
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Of a you know because

1459
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It kind of goes back to saying well

1460
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You know there's fighting games

1461
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And they're all clones of Street Fighter

1462
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Well it's a genre now

1463
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's not necessarily yeah a lot of

1464
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Stuff you know is inspired by

1465
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Or is a clone of something and then they

1466
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Kind of throw their own unique spin on it and there's

1467
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That or there's the

1468
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Games that are on the iOS a lot

1469
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Of games out there that there's guys

1470
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Trying to make a quick buck and they put some with the Angry Birds

1471
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Characters they literally rip the assets

1472
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
From the game and then they create something else

1473
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Or you know something that's like it's

1474
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Angry cats and then there's dogs or something

1475
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Or you just you know to the point where

1476
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That's a rip off don't the masses

1477
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Kind of know how to tell a cheap rip

1478
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Off though well the masses do but see

1479
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It reminds me of those

1480
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
CDs they sell at Target for like

1481
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
$5 that are like you know

1482
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Top 40 hits and all it is it's like

1483
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Really bad cover songs

1484
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Of the stuff that's on the radio right now

1485
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But like a lot of it

1486
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Though it's kind of like

1487
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
One of those things you they have to try to

1488
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Protect their rights or they lose their rights

1489
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
You know it so they kind

1490
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Of have to do this but at the same time

1491
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I think the reason they're doing this is because they're putting games

1492
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Up on the iOS you know platform

1493
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That you know

1494
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I mean they recently released updated

1495
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Versions of Breakout and Asteroids

1496
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So I mean maybe that's why

1497
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
They're doing it but

1498
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I mean okay

1499
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I can't fault them for trying to do that

1500
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And let's be honest there's a lot of shit

1501
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
On the app store that's

1502
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Fucking just ripping off

1503
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
All sorts of shit I mean there's a ton

1504
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Of rip off games out there

1505
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And there's a ton of games inspired by

1506
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Stuff like I would say Vector Tanks

1507
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Is probably

1508
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Somewhat you know

1509
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Original game I mean yeah

1510
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It's inspired by the old vector graphics

1511
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And maybe inspired by Battlezone but it's not

1512
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Like they're not calling it Tank Zone

1513
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And you know it has you know basically

1514
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
All the same gameplay as Battlezone

1515
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I just

1516
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I don't know I think that

1517
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
They should be going out through the right people but they're

1518
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Going out through everybody instead

1519
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And at the same time why aren't the people there

1520
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Making the Mario games and shit like that

1521
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You know getting that stuff taken down

1522
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
To turn this a 180

1523
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
A little bit this is what really worries

1524
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Me about SOPA and that whole thing

1525
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And why you know people are really scared

1526
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Because if you allow corporations

1527
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
To kind of draw the line they're gonna draw

1528
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It too far in the sand one way

1529
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Oh they're gonna take out everything

1530
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It's gonna be crazy

1531
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
If something like that actually passes

1532
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You know I mean and all this

1533
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Stuff that we see is just evidence of that

1534
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Because Atari may overreach

1535
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
In trying to protect

1536
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Their stuff and who's to say

1537
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You know other companies do you trust

1538
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
A lot of these companies to draw the line

1539
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Of course and here's

1540
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
A funny thing too like say for example

1541
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I make a game or something that's pretty

1542
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Original and I release it out there

1543
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And Atari goes

1544
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And I consider ripping

1545
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Off some of my ideas

1546
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Or something like that and that's not necessarily because they do that

1547
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
This game is too much like Custer's Revenge

1548
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That Loki made and so

1549
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
We have the rights to this game

1550
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Even though it was really a third party

1551
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Let's say for example

1552
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Here's an example that's not necessarily accurate

1553
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But

1554
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Was it the ferret tossing game

1555
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Let's just say the ferret tossing game comes out

1556
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And it's too much like

1557
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Defender with the whole

1558
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Scrolling left and right

1559
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Too much like Defender or okay

1560
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
That's a bad example let's just say

1561
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Say I release the game out there

1562
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And all of a sudden you know Atari comes out

1563
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Or not even necessarily Atari just some company

1564
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Comes out and you know a major

1565
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Company and puts out a game

1566
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
On iOS or something like that it's very

1567
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Similar to my game like as far as all the

1568
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Original aspects of that game it's very

1569
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Similar to that I myself

1570
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Go to Apple and say hey I want

1571
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You to take this down are they gonna

1572
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Do it probably not because this

1573
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Major company that you know has a

1574
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Lot more money invested into the app

1575
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Store than I do and they're just probably gonna

1576
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Ignore what I say yet if

1577
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Apple comes and says hey we don't like

1578
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Ferret tossing or whatever like that

1579
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Even though it

1580
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Vaguely resembles something that they may have done

1581
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
They will take it down without

1582
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Who's gonna know where to draw the line

1583
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Nobody is that

1584
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Do you trust the government to draw the line

1585
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Do you think senators

1586
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And all them play video games

1587
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I think one senator came out and said

1588
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Well a lot of my staff does play Mortal Combat

1589
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Like that was the most

1590
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Video game keen thing I've ever heard

1591
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
No it was a

1592
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Justice it was that

1593
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Court case about the

1594
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
ESA versus

1595
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The California law and all that that's where that

1596
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Came out well I think you know to be honest I have

1597
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
A problem with you know if a lot of the

1598
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
People in government that

1599
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
They don't play games I mean honestly

1600
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That's

1601
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I understand that not everybody

1602
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Plays games out there but I would

1603
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I would assume nowadays that the vast majority

1604
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Of the populace plays games in some

1605
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Form or another not necessarily console

1606
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Games but at least on the internet you know the

1607
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Occasional

1608
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Phone game or something like that

1609
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And if these people representing us

1610
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Don't have any fucking clue about

1611
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
What's going on out there

1612
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
They just don't care they'd be like well I don't

1613
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Watch TV so why should I protect the rights of the

1614
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
People that want to watch TV I mean

1615
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
That's just not good

1616
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
We need to get these people out

1617
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Anyhow tangent sorry about that but it's

1618
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Important it's kind of stuff that's going on

1619
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Right now anyhow

1620
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Kind of going in a completely different direction here

1621
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
We mentioned earlier in the show that it

1622
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Is kind of a slow release period there's not a lot

1623
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Of games coming out until closer to the end of the month

1624
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Of course you know Final Fantasy 13 2

1625
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's slow release like B12

1626
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Yes but one game

1627
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
If a certain Best Buy store

1628
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Is to be believed might just come out of nowhere

1629
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And steal the spotlight for this first quarter and that's

1630
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Diablo 3 according

1631
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
To Best Buy

1632
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And this is again to be fair

1633
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's not the whole damn corporation it's one store

1634
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That apparently was in Minnesota

1635
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Where the Twitter user was

1636
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That had a standee that said Diablo 3

1637
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Midnight opening available for

1638
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Purchase 1201 AM on February

1639
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
1st as the launch day and

1640
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
February by the way was spelled wrong

1641
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Well there's been this whole

1642
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Was it missing an R? There's this whole back

1643
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
F-E-B-U-R

1644
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Instead of R-U

1645
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
February yeah which granted

1646
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
February's a tricky word is probably one of the more

1647
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Common misspelled words but still

1648
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Clearly not an official Blizzard

1649
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Product if that's the case

1650
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Now there was this whole back and forth that went on

1651
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
A UK retailer

1652
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Kind of clarified the date too

1653
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And showed a February 3rd date

1654
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And then there was this whole

1655
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Other back and forth where the Best Buy

1656
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Was actually called by the gaming

1657
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Press and that the sign was

1658
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Actually taken down and then

1659
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Bashyok one of the community

1660
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Managers over at Blizzard actually said on

1661
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Twitter lol

1662
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
We can't stop shops from doing whatever they want

1663
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
To do I'm paraphrasing here

1664
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But retailers will find out when the rest of you do

1665
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Basically when it's in an official

1666
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Press release but certainly there's a lot of back

1667
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And forth going on about the release date

1668
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Loki you're on the inside a little bit

1669
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
You're shaking your head over there and then there's

1670
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Micah Whipple

1671
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That's Bashyok

1672
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
No they have not announced an official date yet

1673
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You'll know when they do

1674
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And I said this on Hoard House

1675
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I truly think

1676
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
First off if they're going to street date something it's going to be on a Tuesday

1677
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And not a Wednesday

1678
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It's going to be March 27th

1679
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
The very last day of the quarter that they could do it

1680
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I said

1681
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I firmly believe that

1682
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Because at this point with all the auction house back and forth that's been going on

1683
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And that beta is still going

1684
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
They're going to want plenty of time for people

1685
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
To be able to pre-order

1686
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Get those in and it's going to be carefully

1687
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Timed with the Blizzard blood pact

1688
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
For Warcraft and the fact that

1689
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You're going to have these

1690
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Probably a million people getting it for free

1691
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Because they're committed to WoW

1692
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And they're going to drop it at a time where

1693
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's going to distract them from WoW

1694
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Because nothing is going on in WoW

1695
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So I think end of March is reasonable

1696
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And they're also going to be starting

1697
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Their marketing campaign which will be massive

1698
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And so

1699
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
One month lead time is not enough

1700
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So you will be

1701
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You'll bet your ass that

1702
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And know about it way before it comes out

1703
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com

1704
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Says, why do we have

1705
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
All this secret release date stuff?

1706
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Just tell people, it's silly

1707
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It's not secret, it's the fact that it's not done yet

1708
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's, Diablo 3 is fucking done

1709
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's fucking done and the problem is

1710
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It has to do with the whole, it's the auction house thing

1711
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That's getting tied up in Korea is part of it

1712
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And now they're using this as an excuse

1713
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
To put more into the game

1714
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Which is yet to be revealed

1715
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But I think a lot of this is to

1716
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Make sure that legally that auction house thing

1717
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Gets clearance in all the countries

1718
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I honestly believe that, I think this game should have been out

1719
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Last year and I think they were going to announce it

1720
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
At Blizzcon for a December release

1721
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And change their tune when Korea happened

1722
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So, we'll see

1723
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Virtual M in our chatroom says

1724
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The website does list it as February 1st

1725
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
If you go to bestbuy.com

1726
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But placeholder dates are super common, right?

1727
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's probably, if I remember correctly

1728
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
The last update we got from them

1729
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Was Q1 2012

1730
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And that's kind of an

1731
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You just place a placeholder date

1732
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Usually, like, I used to put it on a weird date

1733
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Like a Saturday or something like that in our system

1734
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So that, you know, I know it's a placeholder date

1735
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But yeah, there's no date for it yet

1736
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
In fact, from

1737
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Yeah, I'm

1738
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm 100% sure there's not an official date for it yet

1739
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Although I haven't gotten an update from Activision in a while

1740
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So probably next time I get it, you know

1741
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, rumors are it could

1742
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The release, the news of a release date

1743
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Could be coming out

1744
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Next week, as early as next week

1745
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
But I think a lot of that's wishful thinking

1746
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
On the community and how sometimes

1747
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That snowballs into, oh, this is news now

1748
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So, we'll see

1749
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Probably what it was is a store jumped a gun

1750
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And they built some, you know

1751
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
POP for the store

1752
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And plus, if, and Virtual M says

1753
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
The website lists it as this

1754
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That's actually, Virtual M probably just explained

1755
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Where the issue came from

1756
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Best Buy didn't get that date from

1757
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
From Blizzard

1758
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
They got it from themselves

1759
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Probably in their own system

1760
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And the store manager was like, oh, we gotta make sales for this

1761
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Let's get a sign made up

1762
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And we're gonna push more sales of this

1763
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And it's February 1st in our system right here

1764
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Props to them for being, you know

1765
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Way to take initiative, but at the same time

1766
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You need to spell

1767
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Alright

1768
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Let's move on to Dark Soccer

1769
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
With some other gaming news

1770
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
This is not a rumor

1771
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Not a rumor

1772
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It's about

1773
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Kaz Harai

1774
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Guess what? He's being promoted

1775
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
To president of Sony

1776
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
That was actually put up by Nikkei

1777
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
By the Japanese Stock Exchange

1778
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
He's going to be replacing

1779
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Howard Stringer

1780
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
The theory is

1781
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
By April

1782
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It should be going on, but they have to finish everything

1783
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Through a board meeting

1784
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And Stringer is staying on as

1785
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
The chairman and CEO

1786
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Yeah, we get a lot more

1787
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Ridge Racer and

1788
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Giant Enemy Crafts

1789
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But man

1790
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Sony's kind of in

1791
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Relatively crappy shape

1792
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, first off

1793
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Let me play this and then we'll come back

1794
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
In honor of Kaz Harai ascending to the throne

1795
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
At the top of Sony

1796
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I think we have to play our very favorite clip

1797
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
From 2006

1798
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Please welcome Kaz Harai

1799
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Ridge Racer

1800
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
The essence of the PlayStation DNA

1801
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Is real change

1802
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And the consumers are ready

1803
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Genji 2

1804
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Is an Ashen game

1805
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Which is based on Japanese history

1806
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Ridge Racer

1807
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Being based on history

1808
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
The stages of the game

1809
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Will also be based on famous battles

1810
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Which actually took place

1811
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
In ancient Japan

1812
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So here's this giant enemy crab

1813

Ridge Racer

01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And you

1815
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Attack its weak point

1816
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
For massive damage

1817
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
It's Ridge Racer

1818
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Ridge Racer

1819
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
PlayStation 3 will retail for

1820
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000

1826
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's Ridge Racer

1827
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Ridge Racer

1828
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Don't forget old. That's Makah45

1829
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
On YouTube by the way

1830
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
That has that clip up there

1831
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I gotta, I gotta put this out there though

1832
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
There's actually a reason why

1833
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I play that clip

1834
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Because it does tie in all this

1835
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's not on the show role tonight

1836
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
But this story makes me think about

1837
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
How there's all of those news about the Vita

1838
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Over in Japan

1839
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
is exhibitionally not doing well

1840
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Like to the point, this was on Yahoo.News

1841
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Where I saw this, so we're

1842
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
pretty, you know, mainstream site

1843
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,960
they're saying the Vita is bombing because the PSP outsold it in Japan last

1844
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,800
week so in other words that's pretty bad they sold more PSP's last week and they

1845
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,040
have the sales numbers to back it up that doesn't bode well for the Vita

1846
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:57,000
however look at that clip this is just history repeating itself all over again

1847
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,800
isn't it well it's too expensive the games are you know well you know hit

1848
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,440
miss I gotta well I gotta give them credit there is a lot of interesting

1849
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,160
stuff and I think a lot of people are really turned off by the price right now

1850
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,440
and in some ways I kind of see history repeating itself here I don't think I

1851
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,480
would write off the Vita as a horrific failure yet I mean it hasn't launched

1852
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,800
here in the US for one I don't know if it's gonna I think it'll sell more than

1853
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:26,160
PSP's do in the same week but I yeah I there's nothing I but I think the 3ds

1854
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:31,520
is gonna stare is nothing coming out for the PSP nothing I mean okay one game but

1855
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:38,240
it's it's a visual novel if I can also point out something last fiscal quarter

1856
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:45,480
Sony lost 1.6 billion yen which is about 20 million dollars or 13 million pounds

1857
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,680
so I mean I but but in my age well you never know like the PlayStation 3

1858
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,320
everybody gave it shit in the beginning everybody gave it shit but it's come a

1859
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,200
long way and right now you know especially with everything we were

1860
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,160
saying with Microsoft at the top of the show PlayStation 3 is it's a pretty good

1861
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,680
system right now you know it really depends on the games you want the

1862
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,000
exclusives and all that but it's it's a worthy competitor the Xbox 360 I don't

1863
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,540
think anybody would have said that in 2006 and honestly I think we're like the

1864
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,560
3ds and stuff I don't see them squeezing out a lot more power out of that system

1865
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,040
then the stuff that's out right now I mean sure there's gonna be some games

1866
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,040
that look pretty nice and can do a little bit more but if 3d is all they

1867
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:28,160
got I mean if you don't like the 3d you got a DS I mean that's pretty much it

1868
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,640
I'm not being a defenseless or a defensive or whatever or being a fanboy

1869
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,560
but I am saying hold on a minute because you know although I will great yes that

1870
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,880
looks very bad that the PSP was out selling the Vita but didn't I could be

1871
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,920
wrong but didn't the same thing happen with 3ds at first where eventually a

1872
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,120
couple months later the older DS was we're out selling the 3ds and now look

1873
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,980
where the 3ds is yeah I mean all it took was a few powerhouse games and now that

1874
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:55,200
nobody's joking about the 3ds everybody's like within a matter of months

1875
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,880
everybody's like okay yeah 3ds here to stay I mean no happening no one's

1876
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,440
arguing that the fact that the 3d the 3ds launch versus the Vita launch I

1877
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,320
mean the launch games are way better on the Vita there's actually stuff that

1878
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,960
people would like on there I'm probably not gonna get one at launch because it

1879
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,960
is too damn expensive and honestly I I don't I don't play my 3ds enough I mean

1880
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,280
fuck I've only played Super Mario 3d land once and I'm not gonna buy a new

1881
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,600
system game guru in our chat room says well yeah 3ds stole Monster Hunter which

1882
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,480
is what everyone bought the PSP for in Japan so you know that those few key

1883
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,680
games can really sell a system I mean you cannot deny that Mario 3d land and

1884
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,040
Mario Kart 7 is the reason why 3ds nobody's you know joking about it

1885
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:45,480
anymore and Monster Hunter in Japan certainly mm-hmm you know so anyhow all

1886
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:52,400
right so cause her I I mean it'll these things happen you know but don't buy

1887
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,920
Ridge Racer do not buy Ridge Racer for the Vita if you're going to buy a game

1888
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,440
for the Vita I seriously if you're trying to buy a cheap game if you're

1889
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:05,000
looking to buy a cheap game from Namco by touch my katamari because that's 30

1890
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,680
bucks and you get a full game versus 30 bucks and get three tracks and five cars

1891
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,620
all my eyes and chat says but Sony doesn't have a system seller like Mario

1892
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:18,120
or Mario Kart they do have uncharted which is pretty big deal over here they

1893
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:22,680
have uncharted they have wiped out if you like wipe out they have well hot

1894
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:28,140
shots golf actually did pretty well in Japan it's not right I won't wipe out on

1895
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:32,440
the same level as Mario Kart I really wouldn't it's not at launch but well

1896
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,320
they have Modination Racers that's a launch title but that on the same level

1897
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:40,260
as Mario Kart I'm like Sony's big within our God of War uncharted well within a

1898
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:45,960
month a little big planet that that'll be big yeah luminous for me and and

1899
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,320
third-party games luminous I don't see as a launch sales well I haven't gotten

1900
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,680
Ubisoft updates yet but I haven't seen any there to launch stuff but in third

1901
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,020
party stuff I mean you've got ninja Ninja Gaiden Sigma I mean that's a

1902
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:04,480
pretty hardcore game ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 blaze blue extent or blaze blue

1903
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:15,280
continuum shift extent there's the MMA game from 505 supremacy MMA I know

1904
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:21,400
there's a FIFA game and you know Ridge Racer touch my katamari which looks

1905
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,080
pretty good there's a lot of good games it's it's not like where huh well let's

1906
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:32,440
see there's Nintendogs and a submarine game oh and pilot wings steel diver all

1907
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,040
right Rama in our chat says if Sony knocked the price of the Vita down to

1908
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:40,160
$1.99 they wouldn't need a system seller per se that maybe losing a lot of money

1909
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,080
yeah that's I guess that's true but don't isn't it common to lose money on

1910
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,320
systems you make it back up with the games yes the Vita the Vita does have a

1911
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,200
lot that's not just games that's another thing you know it does have strengths in

1912
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,360
just like the PSP had the web browser had the mp3s people call into the show

1913
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:01,360
on their PSPs I mean you know let's see ah my eyes agree is true if they knock

1914
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,920
the price down to $1.99 I would buy it and Yuki follows it up with same so the

1915
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,480
price is yeah they're not gonna lose $100 in every system I mean that's just

1916
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,360
stupid I mean it's stupid but at the same time I think it's fucking retarded

1917
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,680
that I've got to buy another memory card that doesn't come with the system I mean

1918
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,960
help the original PSP I think came with a 32 megabyte memory card I agree that

1919
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,440
if they wanted to get they would put a small memory card in yeah like I really

1920
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,120
need to even half not even half a gig but like let's do a 1 gig card I mean

1921
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,000
those things cannot be the price to manufacture that they're charging I

1922
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,440
don't think they would be taking a big loss by throwing one in and I think

1923
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,880
they were really sweet in the pot because I sir I kid you not every single

1924
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,760
one of those games requires a memory card and so here's here's a fun

1925
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:50,760
situation I go buy a Vita and they're sold out of memory cards fuck I can't

1926
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:55,280
play anything all right we got to move on we're running long in part a let's

1927
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,520
move on with some more news Loki it's just like a great plan right there I

1928
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,280
guess what apparently there's some insiders that say that there's going to

1929
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:11,520
be the new unveiling of a new Xbox and new PlayStation this e3 and they

1930
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,040
apparently have it from a very very very very very very very very reliable source

1931
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:21,800
and this is MCV reporting this as well that both of their these new consoles

1932
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:27,840
boom will be making their debut at e3 I'm not surprised I'm not sure if

1933
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,440
obviously though that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna be out

1934
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,840
this year or even next year I mean it could be I could see him coming out

1935
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:40,680
maybe fall next year I call bull on this story because I I would believe the Xbox

1936
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,560
I I think it's about time for the Xbox to show off their next console but I

1937
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,360
don't think PlayStation 4 I don't think we need it yet I feel like PlayStation

1938
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,720
3 took so long to get to its prime I I almost kind of believed the whole 10

1939
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,520
year cycle thing I think I think PlayStation 4 coming out this this soon

1940
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:04,520
is showing it this year I don't know I I Rob I think it's it's a Vita they've

1941
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,640
got to push the Vita they've got to push that through the holiday you don't

1942
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,240
understand though Rob a 10-year cycle doesn't necessarily mean that boom after

1943
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,560
10 years they would launch a new console it means that they launch a new console

1944
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,920
and it overlaps for three years I just III in my gut you know just says they

1945
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,600
either can't be the PlayStation 4 this early it's just too damn early for the

1946
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,400
PlayStation 4 it's a reliable source so it's so reliable the stories in the

1947
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:37,280
reliability I mean it's so reliable I want to get their quote because it was

1948
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,400
it was hilarious

1949
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:46,560
ah nope don't have the quote oh well there's one guy's like I can guarantee

1950
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,440
it a hundred percent it's gonna be there you know it's gonna be there the Wii U

1951
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:56,880
and my disappointment actually you know what I'd be interested easy with this

1952
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,760
what's gonna happen next week during you know the whole cuz CES stuff CES is

1953
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,240
never really gaming I mean well no it was gonna be there with the Wii U yeah

1954
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,040
but they swear up and down it's just the same the exact same thing they showed at

1955
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:14,160
e3 for people who weren't able to wait in that horrifically long line yeah and

1956
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,600
I don't think they need to I mean CES really isn't a gaming show what the

1957
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,480
biggest game news I can think of that ever came out of CES was the Microsoft

1958
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:26,000
Game Room was a big thing that came out it and unfortunately Microsoft Game Room

1959
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,080
didn't last which is such don't get me on that game room had so much freaking

1960
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,800
potential and now it's like ruined it for everything else like I'm just I'm so

1961
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:40,560
mad about game room because it could have been so much more awesome and

1962
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:47,160
really should have been but anyway no I think I think the big things Windows 8

1963
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,400
you know you'll see more stuff about PC and in bigger TVs and 3d TVs and all

1964
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,600
that I don't I don't think it's a lot about gaming consoles you might see

1965
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,320
little things especially from Microsoft and the 360 because they're really

1966
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,840
trying to make the 360 this whole like centerpiece I think they're gonna be

1967
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:09,000
showing off some new channels and if you want to take a total shot in the dark

1968
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,080
maybe something akin to the one versus 100 thing getting out some type of some

1969
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,280
type of entertainment channel how you dig into those channels because I've

1970
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,440
stopped downloading them because I just don't give a shit about them anymore

1971
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,560
they're they're kind of pointless I hate to say it the only one I could ever see

1972
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,200
myself using is that maybe I would use I heart radio if I was hosting a party

1973
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,440
because there are some decent stations on there with very few commercials some

1974
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,600
of the HD simulcasts you know that play like dance music or comedy on loop it's

1975
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,400
kind of like having the satellite radio that's the one that I'm kind of like I

1976
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:48,600
could see myself using this but the rest not really I don't know it that whole I

1977
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,680
don't like the new interface to be honest it's just oh yeah I hate the

1978
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,340
interface but that doesn't mean I don't like the point of some of the channels

1979
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,880
and the Netflix channel certainly although actually I I find it better on

1980
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,320
my ps3 so I used to think now the other we have the technology where we could I

1981
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:09,640
don't know select the interface we want thought maybe hmm I'll be nice we have

1982
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:15,320
the technology we can select it all right well speaking of rumors there are

1983
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,880
some rumors about the really good Fleetwood Mac album there are some

1984
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,880
rumors about the Xbox lube because remember that's what we're calling it

1985
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,800
now if you don't know why we're calling the new Xbox system the Xbox lube you

1986
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,520
have to go back and listen to some old episodes but apparently the Xbox lube is

1987
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:34,240
supposed to be this sounds really slick it's supposed to be a DVR as well okay

1988
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,560
that makes it worthwhile this is according to some patents that are

1989
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,700
floating around out there that apparently on December 27th the US

1990
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,360
patent office gave Microsoft a patent for a device that would be a game

1991
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:49,040
console and a DVR a digital video recorder application running alongside a

1992
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,800
television client component allows users to record media content on the gaming

1993
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,600
console the DVR application also integrates itself with the console menu

1994
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,720
once integrated users can record media content while playing games

1995
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,320
alternatively users can record content when the gaming console is turned off

1996
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,280
the recorded content can include television programming gaming experience

1997
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,880
whether local or online interesting music DVDs and so on when in the

1998
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,600
recording state users can also switch between various other media modes whether

1999
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,520
gaming television and so on I would rather I think this would be more

2000
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,800
something that would be integrated into a television set or integrated into a

2001
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,040
Cosep top box that would be from a cable provider here's my other thing I mean

2002
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,920
although I could certainly see this being feasible for the next system why

2003
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,840
does it have to be the next system isn't it feasible they could release a 360

2004
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,600
that has a DVR built in they could do that but I mean I think that by saying

2005
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:45,120
it's in their next thing that makes it a selling point true true I mean it is the

2006
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,720
kind of the big a big thing but I that's the type of thing really how well did

2007
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:55,360
HD player hypothetically let's say it was in the 360 that I could see coming

2008
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:00,000
out of CES but here's I think dark soccer it's gonna be the next it's never

2009
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,080
I'm telling you it's never gonna happen on its own it's gonna be something from

2010
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:08,440
a cable provider because why are they the cable providers are hey we're

2011
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,880
providing content to you and you're gonna offer a DVR so now we can't charge

2012
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:16,600
people that fee the cost to rent the DVR system out you know and and they don't

2013
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,320
have to buy our you know our higher tier programs to get a you know DVR you're

2014
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,840
gonna pull this shit on us fuck that we want some of that money so that's not

2015
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:28,440
gonna happen they're gonna put that shit out themselves and it's gonna be kind of

2016
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:33,360
like hey you can get Comcast and you get a game player as well you know a Comcast

2017
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,800
box and you get games and you can do all this stuff or it's gonna be integrated

2018
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,720
into a TV you know something like that because I'm telling you they're not

2019
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:45,200
gonna I mean I I would love it it'd be great you know if we could have a DVR

2020
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,880
because then I can DVR shit without having to pay my cable writer to do it

2021
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,640
but I just don't see that happening it's kind of a pipe dream I mean there's

2022
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:00,680
Divix or not Divix there's TiVo but you know who fuck uses TiVo anymore yeah you

2023
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,640
got some support in chat room Loki a lot of folks agree with you Derek H says

2024
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,760
Loki is correct I think he's saying it about this I don't know because of the

2025
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,240
delay there's like a minute delay but Rama in the chat says the console is a

2026
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:15,600
DVR will cause a problem because cable providers will not support it you're

2027
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,320
right there are cable providers in agreement with Xbox Comcast our local one

2028
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,560
is supposed to come on board in early 2012 because if you think about that

2029
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,320
will be shown at CES for sure like if I can if I can DVR like whatever I can DVR

2030
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,960
X show or whatever you know it can do like let's just say I can set it up like

2031
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,640
a TV you know like I can set it up okay I want to record season of this why would

2032
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:43,240
I buy the content off of their service I mean because I already DVR did I mean

2033
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:46,640
they're losing sales that way they're not gonna do that I mean come on they're

2034
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,680
gonna lock that shit out and so it's gonna either come from them or it's

2035
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:55,080
gonna cost something to you know do that yeah I'm I could see where it's gonna

2036
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,000
cost Microsoft points to DVR stuff you know it well and I wouldn't say it's

2037
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,240
necessarily in costume to do so maybe you need a membership or something I

2038
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,360
don't even know if you need members it's got to come from the cable provider it's

2039
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,920
it's seriously that's something that would be like okay because now they have

2040
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,880
these partnerships with these cable companies and stuff where you can do all

2041
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,560
this on the man crap it's got to be something that's coming from them like a

2042
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,240
new set top box what if it just worked with over-the-air TV though I mean

2043
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:23,360
remember you can hook an antenna to your TV and these magical channels and it

2044
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:28,140
works fantastic I can tune in zero channel it depends on where you live in

2045
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:34,760
your connection it's it's terrible I need like a big old retro in order well

2046
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:40,520
no they don't look like that anymore now they're like square they're I mean

2047
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:45,000
seriously I I tried to hooking one up to I was like yeah I'm gonna put this up

2048
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,680
I'm gonna get on my HDTV for free it worked like crap I got nothing not even

2049
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:55,320
a Spanish channel that came in correctly although when I was programming it

2050
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:59,440
actually got worse every time I tried to find stations all right listen I

2051
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,760
actually have to say to be perfectly honest I have no use for DVR I don't

2052
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,040
watch TV Dan doesn't watch TV everything that we watch is streamed I was to say

2053
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:13,280
BBC America maybe I Supernatural on CW I download my shows on the internet

2054
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,920
because I hate commercials mm-hmm and besides that you know the commercials

2055
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,640
are what provide your free television I don't watch the TV I mean Dan the only

2056
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:29,840
shows that he watches is like Sons of Anarchy and Top Gear and guess what he

2057
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,560
streams them from other places we were I mean we're paying for cable we rarely

2058
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,200
use we'd actually downgraded our TV cable and upgraded our internet cable

2059
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,560
see I'm thinking about it but then then that'll be when the next season of

2060
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,760
RuPaul's Drag Race starts it's like I gotta have logo I can't wait till the

2061
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:53,080
next day gotta have it you could well I cannot sashay away my cable is that by

2062
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,840
the time it airs at its normal time someone's already uploaded it from an

2063
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,200
eat from the East Coast showing I got friends that'll spoil Drag Race so then

2064
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:07,360
five minutes of it airing on my Facebook anyhow all right I'll just let's move on

2065
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:14,800
with some more news Dark Sakura I'm not a hipster I'm just hip anyway so media

2066
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,760
molecule is spending a lot of money and it's on new stuff they're actually

2067
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:27,480
trying to innovate wait it's not LittleBigPlanet 3 they basically they're

2068
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:34,720
trying not to rely on LittleBigPlanet as their primary you know safety net if if

2069
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:41,800
you will they are trying to actually expand into different audiences so

2070
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:46,000
they've been spending about and this is from a British news source they're

2071
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:53,200
spending about three point forty four million pounds well that's how much

2072
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,520
profit that they made in 2011 but they're spending four point one million

2073
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:02,520
on research and development so they're keep trying to put their resources into

2074
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,000
new kinds of games to keep innovating so that they don't have to just rely on

2075
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,440
LittleBigPlanet to keep them around because I mean I think it's really smart

2076
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:16,160
too because you know say that you've got a company that's good for just one thing

2077
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:20,240
and that's all they've been doing but after a while the franchise is stale

2078
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:25,400
because I honestly think LittleBigPlanet before too long is gonna hit that place

2079
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,200
where people are gonna expect the same thing and there's not gonna be able to

2080
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,960
pay but for them to put much new into it I think a big problem is it's it's more

2081
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,120
I mean LittleBigPlanet is really a limitless game there's so much you can

2082
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,440
do with it but I think it's the saturation that's gonna be an issue and

2083
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,920
that's not really on media molecule but it's like you know you have your PSP

2084
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,760
version and your Vita version and you're you know it's it's coming out on

2085
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,600
everything well here's a quote on here they say that their investments are

2086
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,560
going into and this is the quote leading edge physics and dynamics rapid world

2087
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,840
creation from laser data innovative routes to marketing no to market via

2088
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,200
web-based interfaces 3d stereo optics for advanced simulation and use of high

2089
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:09,120
def data capture and processing techniques hmm so it looks like just

2090
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:15,720
from what I can seeing on here they're trying to branch out but try to work on

2091
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,360
stuff it sounds like they're really working on immersion they're making the

2092
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,120
holodeck basically they are making a holiday at clay station holodeck they're

2093
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:30,560
trying to make it where I think it's not just they're extending to immerse but

2094
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,720
they're actually trying to draw in your feedback into the game to make it

2095
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,900
customizable into whatever they're working on Derek H in our chat room at

2096
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:42,720
chat dot orange laundry calm says 1.5 million to find new games come on that's

2097
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,240
just another way to write hookers and blow I don't think so perhaps you know

2098
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:52,320
that's just kind of I would buy a game hookers and blow which especially if

2099
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,520
it's that whole 3d immersive experience like you know you see her nose that's

2100
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,720
about to snort the cocaine just jumping right out of the TV I want man horse

2101
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:07,040
then you need to play Saints for the third all right somebody would lend it

2102
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,280
to me alright I could play it I just lazy let's move on and travel the world

2103
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:17,280
with some release dates and Loki start us off with the u.s. although I don't

2104
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,440
like last week there was literally nothing so I don't know if this week's

2105
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:26,400
the same thing but uh yeah there's pretty much nothing um this week there

2106
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:36,760
is well not much I believe my pet puppy 3d from five five games I want to say

2107
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:43,960
that I got laid I can't honestly well here I will get you the definitive list

2108
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:50,160
here okay but yeah I seriously it was like nothing I think was actually this

2109
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:58,040
week we had like three releases of some UMD games hmm there were from well that

2110
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:10,280
was actually like this week but um let's see coming out this week ah yes there is

2111
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,120
pretty much nothing so let's start off with four and one action pack from South

2112
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,600
Beach games it's four games that were featured on the PlayStation Network and

2113
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:27,280
they're all terrible including mushroom wars digger wave wave was it a

2114
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:37,400
smash cars and wakeboarding HD all for 20 bucks so I mean that's pretty good

2115
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:43,800
right national geographic challenge for PlayStation 3 as well this week and that

2116
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:49,400
is it those are the two games you can expect this week except I bet you

2117
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,360
anything foreign one action-packed doesn't come out this week so maybe one

2118
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:58,600
game that's all you get and they're all terrible uh yeah well I mean I don't

2119
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,840
know if they're absolutely I'm looking forward to mushroom wars because they're

2120
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:08,640
for five bucks I mean for five bucks a game I mean that's not bad I mean I

2121
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,160
would think this is no one's looking for this game in the series so instead of

2122
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:18,240
being diarrhea it's just solid poop stop all right let's move to the Japanese

2123
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:22,960
release dates it's a there's at least a couple things this week in Japan on the

2124
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,880
PlayStation 3 there's a game called time leap coming out I'm not sure what time

2125
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:31,000

2126
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,160
romance dating game yeah I've played one of those really animates the characters

2127
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,600

2128
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:47,360

2150
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:49,800
it's crushed it did it crush three days crushed I don't care done our release

2151
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:54,800
dates have been crushed all right just a couple more news stories for you guys

2152
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,680
in the classic game of the week you know we kind of sounded like what was that

2153
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:04,680
anime club thing I didn't even watch that I watched it because of John and I

2154
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,920
was like you know what was said is that I know people like that all right low

2155
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:13,240
key so there's been some or there's gonna be some changes coming to Xbox

2156
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:20,280
Live indie games this includes that they've now allowed people to you know

2157
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:26,160
increase the file size of games from 150 megabytes to a new maximum of 500

2158
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:31,200
megabytes and also they've removed I guess the restriction that all games

2159
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:35,800
exceeding 50 megabytes in size were required to be priced at either $3 or

2160
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:41,280
$5 making them hard to position I guess against Xbox Live arcade games but now

2161
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,960
the minimum price has been reduced to $1 or 80 Microsoft points all across the

2162
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:51,800
board so now you can see a lot more $1 games which is awesome and then of

2163
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,760
course they've also raised the number of caps of titles that any developer is

2164
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:00,160
allowed to host on Xbox Live indie games originally it was 10 now they can have a

2165
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:07,240
total of 20 games at a time so neat I guess of course none of the changes that

2166
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:11,000
they made have made it easier to find Xbox Live indie games on the actual

2167
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,520
service so that's too bad we'll be posting lots of direct links when bungee

2168
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,960
ferret tossing comes out which now with the expanded space I'm expecting Aaron

2169
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:25,400
to include video clips of ferrets and clips from our show and I'm just kidding

2170
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:31,600
he can do whatever seriously you need to get some of that ferret b-roll you need

2171
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,920
to be able to put in the Konami code and just get get actual videos of ferrets

2172
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:43,600
would be great ferret b-roll and it plays the Benny Hill theme oh wait that

2173
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,200
would be copyright stuff maybe there's like maybe there's like one of those

2174
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:51,600
really bad music free free things that sounds like the Benny Hill theme but

2175
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,840
it's not yeah it's something alright I was suggesting from the kitchen that it

2176
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,720
be played backwards alright one other story for you guys before the classic

2177
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,080
game of the week we were talking about the Vita a minute ago and oh you know

2178
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,400
the old saying on this show hackers gonna hack so how long did it take the

2179
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:13,600
did Sony ever claimed that the Vita was unhackable was that claim ever made I

2180
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,320
don't think they did this time no I think they just assumed yeah well it's

2181
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:21,720
been done the Vita's already been hacked and the first thing that's been running

2182
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:28,000
on it Genesis games yay Linux not a bad idea Sonic and knuckle why are you

2183
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,920
cheering not Linux because I'm kind of getting I see the quintessential thing

2184
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,040
is to install Linux yes when you when you hack the system you put Linux on it

2185
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:42,680
write your hello world program I'm sure I'm sure someone did that but this is

2186
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:46,160
something that people will want to download and use a lot of as the Genesis

2187
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:50,760
games on the PlayStation Vita Sonic and knuckles now apparently running on the

2188
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:55,360
PlayStation Vita it's been out less than a month apparently it's a homebrew

2189
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:59,880
Genesis emulator that was originally built for the PSP it's running on the

2190
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,400
Vita's PSP emulator yes that's right it's an emulator emulating an emulator

2191
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:16,240
emulating a Sega blast process and I've gone cross-eyed so there you go Sony apparently

2192
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,840
has put in some security that is going to meet that exploit moot as soon as it

2193
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,520
is made available according to the video's uploader but how long is that

2194
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,700
gonna last watch the PSP they patch new exploit they patch new exploit watch the

2195
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:33,720
Wii they patch new exploit they patch new exploit and then they just forget

2196
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:38,680
the patch and the cycle continues at some point they just say fuck it all

2197
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,840
right remember back in the day when you didn't hack your no because you were

2198
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,920
playing a Genesis if I hacked it I used an axe remember when you actually were

2199
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,800
playing Sonic enough Sonic and knuckles on an actual Genesis what like two weeks

2200
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:57,200
ago so so do we here at orange lounge radio we like to revisit the classic

2201
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:01,800
games in a segment we call the classic game of the week every week dark soccer

2202
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,520
dives into the vault and now she brings a little piece of it over because it's

2203
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,320
not down the hall anymore yeah so she brings a little piece of the vault with

2204
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,480
her in a segment we call the classic game of the week dark soccer what should

2205
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:19,600
the kiddies be playing this week in America it was known as Rastan in Japan

2206
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:25,240
and England it was called Rastan saga ooh it was put up by Taito and he played

2207
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:29,720
a barbarian beaten shit up let's have some of that music Rob roll that

2208
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:40,080
beautiful bean footage I've been hearing this game music play endlessly because

2209
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,760
Dan has decided he's on a Rastan kick and has been watching video playthroughs

2210
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:51,040
of Rastan we turn down the audio there so we can hear you yeah so much Rastan

2211
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:57,040
anyway so it's sort of inspired by Greek mythology so you've got monsters coming

2212
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:04,200
out and you have to beat them up with your sword or an axe or hammers some of

2213
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,680
the weapons are also jewels and you get shields and mantles you also can get a

2214
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:11,720
goat's head I think it gives you a one-up or something was it an

2215
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:19,120
advertisement for God of War maybe like seeing into the future um anyway as far

2216
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:25,760
as the background got graphics for the arcade version you actually had sunlight

2217
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:30,400
effects and it was fairly innovative for its time like look at the background on

2218
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,280
that video for a minute mm-hmm make sure that you send a link of that Toronto for

2219
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:40,080
our tumbler okay oh I forgot Rama was queen of the tumbler now yes

2220
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,880
congratulations on your promotion I have a hard time hitting the tumbler on my

2221
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:50,640
little dinky notebook listeners get Jamie laptop I'm getting no no no you can use

2222
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:54,760
that guy that rock over there that Alan was using that's okay I want anyone

2223
01:32:54,760 --> 01:33:01,160
anyway um with the Japanese version actually did get a full dedicated

2224
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,240
cabinet but the North American and European ones never did there's rakit

2225
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:09,840
conversions so you could convert an existing cabinet to whatever the kit was

2226
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:16,800
you had any buttons joysticks decals marquees blah blah blah blah blah also

2227
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:23,340
the opening to the story as what's on this particular version it was not

2228
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:29,760
included in any versions but the Japanese version so here is sort of in

2229
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,320
a nutshell I'm just gonna read from the article here the game explains that he

2230
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:37,280
would be given all the treasures of an empire in exchange for a terrible

2231
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:44,360
dragon's head and when you beat a stage or the rounds as they're called you

2232
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:49,680
actually get a victory screen that goes with the storyline in the American

2233
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,640
version there's just sort of the generic story you were a warrior you cleared

2234
01:33:53,640 --> 01:34:00,600
this crap hooray for you here's some money and some bitches it kind of the

2235
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:05,280
opening scene I have to say makes me think of Conan you know the end of the

2236
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,320
movie when he's sitting on his throne but that is another story he also just

2237
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,680
looks like Conan yeah I mean you know this was the 80s the whole barbarian

2238
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:18,680
thing was totally rocking on you know and I believe that this came out in I

2239
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:28,280
want to say 87 don't quote me yet as far as the ports that came out there were

2240
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:34,280
there's a Sega Master System version which I've got they actually had decent

2241
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:38,200
music believe it or not the master system had pretty decent music there's

2242
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:43,520
an MSX version a game give version in 91 oh for the record the Master System and

2243
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:50,320
MSX versions came out in 88 there was a PC one in 1990 Commodore 64 version in

2244
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:58,640
1987 a spectrum version 87 CPC version in 88 an Apple to GS in 1990 and the

2245
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:04,440
Commodore 64 version the game was impossible to finish Rob what how did

2246
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,640
they manage that had a bug in the game yikes the bug would prevent a player for

2247
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,680
making a particular jump from one platform to the other he would always

2248
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:16,080
fall short I could never make it across I don't remember that I mean I didn't

2249
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:21,880
play this game on 64 but that's that's uh that's got to be irritating to say

2250
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:27,120
least well for anyone who wants to play it now there is it was included in title

2251
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:32,840
legends with ps2 and Xbox and PC in 2006 which funny enough is how I played this

2252
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:40,440
game I do have title legends so didn't you get it for free no what it no that

2253
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:44,160
was the year that you bought it when the title thing was going on it yeah I know

2254
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,120
that was the gaming if you're thinking classic gaming Expo was the Midway

2255
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:50,280
arcade treasures that was it because I batted my eyes and I flirted with a

2256
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:55,880
Midway lady yeah okay so anyway who was very nice I'm very sad to see the

2257
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:00,800
Midways no more well there were two sequels there was a game called Rastan

2258
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:06,760
saga 2 that came out as nastar in Europe and nastar warrior in North America and

2259
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:14,680
then warrior blade Rastan saga episode 3 there was a 3d fighting game that was

2260
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:19,040
put out by Titus software for ps2 and Nintendo Gamecube that was called

2261
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:24,600
barbarian in the u.s. the game was licensed by Taito and called warrior

2262
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:29,960
blade Rastan versus barbarian when it came out in Japan it also did come out

2263
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:36,080
in Europe later it didn't really have Rastan in it though it wasn't really

2264
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,600
related to the universe it was just oh we could put Rastan on this and it will

2265
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,800
sell and he also made the character Rastan made an appearance in a title

2266
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:52,040
game called champion wrestler as miracle Rastan and now this game it came into

2267
01:36:52,040 --> 01:37:00,240
some censorship issues that while it wasn't really that adult content it had

2268
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:06,320
blood splattered effects when you uh you know beat things yes red pixels yeah

2269
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:12,640
they're right and in the Sega Master System support it actually had some

2270
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:22,520
boobage in it the Gorgon and harpies were very booby and pubey and the Medusa

2271
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:30,160
itself is actually just is all boobies so but I mean that was before we had

2272
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:39,120
the ESRB so probably today it might have had an M rating how about that but no we

2273
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:45,080
got boobs in the 80s and that's it all right there's your classic game of the

2274
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:51,080
week Rastan not to be confused with Rygar which is it's especially the

2275
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:54,400
arcade was somewhat of a similar looking game I mean the NES version was way

2276
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,560
different but indeed not the same game Rastan and now that we're coming up to

2277
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:04,640
our break Rob you know what I think it's time for what Polish chocolate cake I

2289
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:03,400
asking what we were playing live during the break now the podcast listeners

2290
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,000
don't really hear this they just hear that ten seconds a little musical

2291
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,440
interlude we do usually take a break of about six minutes or so we're actually

2292
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,360
live taping you know to to run to the restroom or in this case get cake the

2293
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:17,240
dark soccer brought or what have you and we played some music from OC remix

2294
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,660
during the break I don't usually talk about this on the podcast but I had so

2295
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:23,420
many live people asking what those songs were and the fact that you can go to OC

2296
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:26,060
remix and just download these for yourselves I'll go ahead and tell you

2297
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:30,560
what it was that first song was will rock was the artist from Mega Man 3 it

2298
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,160
was called magnetic fireworks and the second song we played there was a remix

2299
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:37,700
from the goonies to password music screen believe it or not but I like that

2300
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:43,000
mix a lot that was TJ neko with two K's any any EK KO with I'm taking it all

2301
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,400
back was the name of that so those are the two songs from OC remix we played so

2302
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,300
if you want podcast listeners what you could do is is you stop right when you

2303
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,120
hear the music interlude go listen to those two songs then come back and it's

2304
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,320
it's like you were listening live but you know obviously for copyright reasons

2305
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,680
and so forth even though those songs are free to download on OC remix it just

2306
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:04,460
isn't right for us to put them into our own darn show we're gonna be getting

2307
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:07,720
into some rapid-fire news here in a minute but first I thought I would talk

2308
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:11,440
Disneyland because you know I went to Disneyland this week I didn't miss any

2309
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,360
shows because of it because we went in the middle of the week I've had like 18

2310
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,720
days off of work it's been the best thing ever I sat on your cat yes so dark

2311
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:23,640
soccer was cat sitting which of course we're incredibly thankful for and we

2312
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:28,360
well we took some pictures we took some pictures they actually had the Tron bike

2313
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:33,760

2314
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,440
the week go figure I don't think it will be moving for it was it was the most

2319
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:56,760
spring but you were looking at the pictures and dark soccer was commenting

2327
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:45,120
Duffy's just like this cute little bear that many made for Mickey so that he

2328
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:48,160

2340
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,520

01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:54,480
extreme and go to Euro Disney I would actually love to or it's Disneyland

2342

Paris now by the way but I would actually love to go to Disney World it's

2343
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:00,240
just it's a little more expensive to go cross-country and you have to go just

2344
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,600
the right time of year because I don't want to be super crowded but I don't

2345

2353
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:49,920
gaming news get into some rapid-fire news thank you Alan for doing that by

2354
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,760
the way all right thank you Alan for doing that let's go back to some gaming

2355
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:59,880
news so I can eat some cake all right so the game by notch mini craft it's the

2356
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:04,160
you know one that he created in 48 hours last year some important to the Android

2357
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:08,600
devices and apparently it's not an official port of the game but it's been

2358
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:15,640
done by a group called full stad consulting and has touchscreen controls

2359
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:19,120
and all that fun stuff and apparently I believe it's free from the Android

2360
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:25,720
marketplace so go check it out if you're interested in that this I have no idea

2361
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:31,680
why people would buy this but there is a new device called the retro 2 it's a USB

2362
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:38,240
device that allows you to play Super NES and Genesis games and emulators the

2363
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:44,240
actual thing costs $85 but will allow you to plug in your controllers and what

2364
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:48,480
not into it and play it through an emulator or you could probably buy a

2365
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:53,880
real console for that price just saying I mean I don't know why you would bother

2366
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:57,400
to try to play these through emulators just just last week we were talking

2367
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:00,800
about flea markets and like how some of the old systems still were like the

2368
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:05,040
Super Nintendo I have over there still works so you know just go get the old

2369
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:09,040
console seriously for 85 various spent $85 on something you can you can

2370
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:13,080
literally I think you can buy those like portable handheld systems or whatever

2371
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:17,880
that play you know Genesis and Super Nintendo games and stuff like that for

2372
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:24,440
like less a lot less than that so I mean why would you bother to spend $85 on

2373
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:31,360
that I got a text from Dan Duffy the focus group bear so I I just don't know

2374
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:36,920
why but if you're interested you can check it out it's retro dot-com I

2375
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:44,240
believe yes r-e-t-r-o-d-e if you want to purchase that and then of course a Bobo

2376
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:51,880
you may remember him or not from the oh I know I can't remember the goddamn name

2377
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:59,120
double dragon yes I was like dragon age dragon to dragon twin drag got wolf

2378
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:03,080
something I know it has dragon isn't twin dragons like a plate no that's twin

2379
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:08,440
Cobra and that was a helicopter game yes yes so about was big adventure is a

2380
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:14,120
free-to-play flash game and of course features one of the characters from

2381
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:21,080
double dragon this game reminds me a lot of oh what was the one that they did for

2382
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:27,080
there was another one it was I can't remember now maybe it's this game

2383
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:32,000
actually them thinking of anyways the game will be coming out on January 11th

2384
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,280
and I guess it's a firm are confirmed on the official website about was big

2385
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:40,480
adventure calm and you can play the game when it comes out and of course it

2386
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:48,040
features a bunch of old NES settings and parodies so should be fun all right

2387
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:52,040
moving on to some other rapid-fire news you know I love this series kid Icarus

2388
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:56,120
of course there's the new uprising game that's coming out mmm what this quarter

2389
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:59,120
at some point right do we have a firm date for that yet yeah it's in March I

2390
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:02,080
just don't remember what date so at the end of this quarter but in the meantime

2391
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:06,280
you can play with some fan remakes there's a fan remake out there called

2392
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:10,880
super kid Icarus it's what they're calling a 16-bit remake but that's a

2393
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,840
little bit deceptive because basically it's a PC version of kid Icarus that

2394
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:18,600
uses 16-bit style sprites but very clearly a lot of the fonts and things

2395
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,280
that are used or PC but whatever you can play it in your emulator and it's

2396
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:27,000
basically kid Icarus was souped up graphics and easy mode so if you uh you

2397
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,200
know kid Icarus is kind of a fucking hard game so if you want to play it a

2398
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,240
little easier you can do that in this I did play a little bit of it just to I

2399
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:37,400
wanted to see if there was more than just the first level in there and yes I

2400
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:41,360
got all the way to the second level so there you go so they're playing now

2401
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:44,280
before Nintendo pulls it down that's right you want to do that now before

2402
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:48,160
they pull it down this is interesting because the website that actually has it

2403
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:54,320
is home.com cast net slash tilde super kid Icarus so enjoy it now before it

2404
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:58,000
gets pulled because I'm sure Comcast will get that cease and desist from

2405
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,280
Nintendo any minute now meanwhile speaking of Nintendo a lot of folks very

2406
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:06,280
excited about the Zelda 25th anniversary symphony that's going on the symphony of

2407
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:10,700

2418
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:05,720
so if you'd like live symphony I think you'll enjoy that God of War 4

2419
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:11,480
apparently has been spotted on a composer's resume it's the first bit of

2420
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:14,880
anything God of War 4 that we've seen was on the resume of Timothy Williams

2421
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,840
who is the God of War series composer apparently it's on his resume but really

2422
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,760
is it any fucking surprise to the God of 4 God of War 4 is in the making I

2423
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:30,400
didn't think so God of 4 God of 4 I think that's that's what they should

2424
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:36,880
actually call it so there you go God of 4 all right Dark Sakura no I will not

2425
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:41,720

Street Fighter across Tekken and that is shall you and M bison or as he is known

2432
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:20,040

2434
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:34,320
Lou and M bison are involved as far as rock band news it's Rob's absolute

2435
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:40,420
favorite band ever Hall & Oates I was gonna say Abba has an exclusive thing

2436
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:44,740
with a SingStar franchise so it can't be that there's a Hall & Oates pack Oh one

2437
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:49,240
which has private eyes I can't go for that and man-eater I would I would get

2438
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:55,160
man-eater I kind of privatize is awesome and actually man eaters pretty awesome

2439
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:02,320
to it every time I think of Paula notes I think of Patton Oswalt talking about

2440
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,020
if they had those surgery shows back in the 80s people would want to look like

2441
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:11,000
Hall & Oates I'm gonna look like Steve Gutenberg I like what spazz nator

2442
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:16,760
suggests in chat here god of guar god of war that would be awesome they should

2443
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:21,120
have a guar mod for God of War don't they have guar songs in rock band I got

2444
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:26,440
to have something that would be awesome yeah and the last but not least House of

2445
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:31,200
the Dead three and four are both coming to PSN but no typing of the dead so

2446
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,960
therefore failure guess what I have two copies of typing of the dead for like

2447
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,280
Dreamcast I don't even know where the fuck my Dreamcast keyboard is if I even

2448
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:41,320
have I have the Dreamcast version and PC version you need to have typing of the

2449
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:45,720
dead day you know what we need to do cuz Mavis Beacon ain't got shit on typing of

2450
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:50,680
the dead you know we need to do what we need to get Jessica iguana girl she was

2451
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:53,840
really good at that one she and we need to have a typing of the dead a thon

2452
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:59,120
because when I got Michael when I got my copy I took it to her apartment the the

2453
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:03,320
apartment that she was living in when I met her and we'd play typing of the dead

2454
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:07,120
for like three hours I bet I bet I know what apartment that was she lived there

2455
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:13,880
for ever several yes yes I remember that one yeah but the one that I stayed up

2456
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:18,760
for three days without sleep making a costume with Evan anyway anyway anyway

2457
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:23,600
but yeah how's the dead three came out in 2002 and how's the dead four has only

2458
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:28,400
been in the arcade so this is an exclusive to PSN nice now how about the

2459
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,520
Silent Hill game I know different company but that Silent Hill arcade

2460
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,760
game seriously why haven't we seen this released somewhere for the home because

2461
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,120
they have a stick up their ass oh okay that answers everything and they're

2462
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:44,240
currently stuck on it and the moment that they learn how to stand up without

2463
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:50,360
taking the stick up their ass with them we'll probably see it I'm having to hide

2464
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:55,840
poor Duffy's version Virgin Disney ears is it too much to ask for some Duffy

2465
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:03,960
come over here is too much to ask for some fucking silent hill arcade game

2466
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:09,680
and I think that Rob has a potty mouth and he should eat so God this is just

2467
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:14,120
like a little Santorum on Horde house this week I'm not even gonna explain it

2468
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:18,800
what I'm not even gonna explain it horde house calm little centaur yeah that's I

2469
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:29,800
can just imagine it ha at Rick Santorum asshole all right look yeah for the

2470
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:35,560
record that was an authentic southern accent I know was it oh I couldn't is

2471
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:42,520
that dark soccer is it George Bush I'm not sure moving on Loki maybe you can

2472
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:45,640
bring some video game news back into this program that used to be about

2473
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:50,920
gaming talk about piracy all right whatever I'll take what I can get so of

2474
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:56,280
course a report came out talking about the most pirated games of 2011 this is

2475
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,760
coming from torrent freak I would think that they would know a little bit about

2476
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:07,920
piracy now now Loki Tory isn't it's just a bit torrent news site how dare you

2477
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:12,000
well they should still be up to date with you know what's going on including

2478
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,280
piracy I mean come on I'm not suggesting that they are pirating themselves or

2479
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,720
facilitating party in any way I am just saying that you know they should know

2480
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:26,880
something about it anyways the number one game that has been downloaded 3.9

2481
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:34,520
million times since its release in March of 2011 the crisis to crisis to the

2482
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:39,560
game sequel to the game that killed PCs around the world you know but yes

2483
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:44,760
crisis to number one game of course modern warfare 3 was downloaded an

2484
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:50,520
estimated 3.6 million times since November so you know modern warfare 3

2485
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:54,880
had come out in March and they would probably been number one but oh well

2486
01:54:54,880 --> 01:55:00,400
don't wait battlefield 3 coming in third with 3.5 million downloads and then of

2487
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:07,760
course that ring rounding out the top 5 piva 12 and portal to there you go

2488
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:15,320
surprised what's not on the list maybe anything I mean that was all PC stuff

2489
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:20,960
let's talk a little bit about how about Xenoblade well I'm surprised more people

2490
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,360
didn't pirate that to be able to play it in the US now now you spoke too soon the

2491
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:32,600
top Wii game downloads on bit torrent in 2011 Super Mario Galaxy 2 Mario sports

2492
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:36,240
mix what the fuck are people down the Mario sports mix that's a terrible very

2493
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:40,120
good question I get galaxy 2 because that was on a lot of the best list and

2494
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:44,480
Xenoblade Chronicles was number 3 Lego Pirates of the Caribbean number 4 and

2495
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:52,200
FIFA 12 number 5 weird list yeah Xbox 360 downloads Gears of War 3 number 1

2496
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,360
Call of Duty Mario warfare 3 number 2 battlefield 3 number 3

2497
01:55:56,360 --> 01:56:02,040
Forza Motorsports 4 number 4 and connect sports season 2 number 5 not that we're

2498
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:07,280
advocating piracy but you know it's it happens we'd be naive to sit here and go

2499
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:11,040
oh it never happens that's all don't pay no attention behind a curtain it is

2500
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:15,280
interesting to see what gets pirated and what doesn't because certain games don't

2501
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:18,040
show up on the list at all because of maybe the DRM that's in the game like

2502
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:23,160
for example or like a game like SWTOR can't be pirated that much because you

2503
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:29,040
have to have an online connection to play so hmm Starcraft 2 big PC game no

2504
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:33,120
more on that list I think because of the whole battle net tie-in of course a lot

2505
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,520
that drives a lot of people bonkers because they don't want to be on the

2506
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,960
internet to play the game so where's the happy middle ground I don't know all

2507
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:44,160
right anyhow moving on to a system that I'm sure nobody's gonna pirate any games

2508
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:49,680
on at all the Wii U there's a new rumor about the Wii U because you know rumors

2509
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:52,880
about the Wii U or are everywhere and it's a slow news week so why the hell

2510
01:56:52,880 --> 01:57:00,000
not apparently Wii U will also double as an e-reader this is apparently via a

2511
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:06,760
friend who Nintendo approached to do iOS software ports over to the Wii U system

2512
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:10,760
which doesn't surprise me at all that you know the Wii U would probably be

2513
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:14,920
going after things like Angry Birds cut the rope tiny tower the stuff that's

2514
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:19,760
really big on iOS to be able to be played on the you know touch device I

2515
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:23,360
wouldn't surprise me at all but apparently Nintendo is also looking at

2516
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:29,200
doing digital books magazines comics and so forth on the Wii U and the 3ds

2517
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:33,360
apparently instruction manuals could be done this way to strategy guides and

2518
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:39,280
Nintendo power you know it'd be really funny hmm but there's no way this is

2519
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:43,920
ever gonna happen is if the Wii U controller actually became its own

2520
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,960
console but it can't I mean because all the processing is done on that I

2521
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,960
understand that they could put an ARM processor in there and how like its own

2522
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:55,760
tablet yeah I'm kind of deja vu-ing what we talked about a little bit last week

2523
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,040
but yeah we talked about how maybe one of the big things that they're gonna

2524
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:01,880
change you know because the system could change a lot but until next t3 is that

2525
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:05,660
maybe they're gonna put the its own processor a little or processor in the

2526
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:09,600
Wii U controller itself it's gonna drive the price of those things up even more

2527
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:14,580
but processors are cheap really yeah I guess it's true it just depends on what

2528
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:20,160
they put in there so DDR dollar bill in our chat room says we you trying to be a

2529
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:27,280
tablet yeah tablets are terrible well here's the thing though I think a lot of

2530
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:32,040
it would be the fact that Nintendo would have a big audience with kids like maybe

2531
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:37,360
kids are too young to have their own iPad Rob what how well did the Pico do

2532
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:42,240
really but but kids could use the Wii U controller I see that's the thing though

2533
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,800
is I don't think kids are too young to have an iPad well let me put this way a

2534
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:49,260
lot of parents don't think kids are too young to have an iPad and they will buy

2535
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:53,600
them an iPad or an iPod or something I mean I remember seeing on some gaming

2536
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:58,520
blogs a stupid iPod you know touch freak out you know Christmas videos and stuff

2537
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:01,120
like that I mean come on parents are willing to buy their kids that kind of

2538
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,920
stuff there are cat games on iPad I mean there's there's games for toddlers on

2539
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:11,000
the iPad so I'm not surprised that they would do that and I mean seriously with

2540
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,720
an iPad 3 coming out probably soon I mean it's only gonna drive the prices of

2541
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:22,320
the older models down so why wouldn't they you know parents buy an iPad I'm

2542
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:26,560
not surprised parents will let their kids play with an iPad because people

2543
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:30,520
are letting their frogs and lizards play with their iPad that ant smasher game

2544
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:38,640
well people are dumb well as long as the as long as the Wii U gets swap note

2545
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:41,840
that's all I care about which by the way if you could smile big cuz I'm gonna

2546
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,000
take a picture for Bobby here maybe I'm not smiling big maybe I'll send it to

2547
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,680
Tiger Claw to their little 3d picture there of all our life all right with

2548
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:59,080
Duffy adorable hey swap note is actually pretty cool it's like it's it's like

2549
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:04,360
it's like Nintendo is finally understanding email well I'm glad they

2550
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:12,040
got that bad bank bandwagon if I can only speak now I'm yeah man I'm really

2551
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:19,080
looking forward to them understand you know patching games in 2021 or something

2552
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:23,400
like that you know maybe with the Wii U that we'll get some actual game

2553
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:30,200
patching fantastic Nintendo and for the record I'm putting a picture of Duffy's

2554
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:37,400
butt on the olr thing orange launch radio.com all right let's take a moment

2555
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:43,480
to visit the mailbag every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge

2556
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:48,680
radio.com and dark soccer dives into the email bag and read your favorite emails

2557
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:51,640
I was gonna say we should start taking emails over swap note but you'd have to

2558
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:57,360
have my friend code to do that Duffy should start reading them no Duffy

2559
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:01,680
should not read them all right anyhow while I work on my swap note I'm gonna

2560
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:04,440
send a swap note to Bobby and I guess I'll send it to Tiger Claw I don't know

2561
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:07,280
who else listens to olr on my friends list but I'll send it to them too well I

2562
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:13,000
wanted to announce that we do have three winners for the Master System contest

2563
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,040
wieners wieners that means I have to do I think I've got games enough to divide

2564
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:25,720
amongst them as well someone is from will and I will be logging into the

2565
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:37,760

2567
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:50,880
I'm gonna try to send you ones that you don't already have so and I know who's

2568
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:57,160
about getting wet and if you get a duplicate sorry eBay we can autograph

2569
02:01:57,160 --> 02:02:03,520
them though if you want us to so back to the the mailbag I just played the worst

2570
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:08,160
game in history of Nintendo DS I asked for it for Christmas because I love

2571
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:13,920
Puss in Boots and a sexy Antonio voice well unfortunately the reviews I were

2572
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,680
looking at were for the Wii version of the game which apparently is decent this

2573
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:22,320
however this abomination should never have been made it is surely the spawn of

2574
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:26,480
Satan and all copies should be destroyed seriously the graphics look like

2575
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:32,000
something back from early early PlayStation 1 or Nintendo 64 back when

2576
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,500
their characters look like they were made of Lego blocks no voices and the

2577
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:39,520
gameplay tap the screen to the beat no seriously that's the whole stupid game

2578
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:44,640
and that's what I get for buying a tie-in game I guess but I really thought

2579
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:51,440
the treat puss with some respect sad face Holly D haven't we warned you

2580
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:57,200
about tie-ins that's right game tie-ins can be pretty bad but or movie is game

2581
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:03,680
times movie tie-ins games can be pretty bad next email bummer though hi olr crew

2582
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:07,600
I've never seen the tester on PSN not the first season of the second mostly

2583
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:11,400
because I'm over reality shows I also thought the grand prize of being an

2584
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:14,220
entry-level tester was kind of stupid though a great way for you to get your

2585
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:17,440
foot in the door but I think I'm going to start watching the new season because

2586
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:21,160
I just found out a friend of a friend is a contestant we were chatting on

2587
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:23,920
Facebook and I asked her if she'd be interested in appearing as a guest on

2588
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:28,800
olr but only if you're interested she seemed very interested and I would have

2589
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:32,920
to get but would have to get back to me to see if corporate folks would allow

2590
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:38,280
her to do so so my question is would you be interested why the hell not sure I

2591
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:41,760
want to know who beat dark soccer for the position no dark soccer went through

2592
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:47,560
herself right I'm not gonna give any more of her information just because

2593
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:51,200
because it's included in the email sure sure but we are interested yeah why not

2594
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:56,200
if corporate PSN will let us then we're happy for it I would love to ask some

2595
02:03:56,200 --> 02:04:00,200
questions about the stuff I want to wait till the show debuts though so we can be

2596
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:03,340
like okay how bad did they misrepresent this well maybe there is at least one

2597
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:08,080
person it's somewhat internet celebrity that's actually in there oh really yeah

2598
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:12,560
the guy does I don't know if you've ever seen them the the awesome games like

2599
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:20,480
Metal Gear awesome they're like great he's actually in in the contention there

2600
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:25,240
that's funny so rooting for him because he's the only person they recognize

2601
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:29,920
vaguely anyway says thanks and keep up the good work and thanks for putting the

2602
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,800
podcast up on Mondays they're not so blah anymore that's from Stan I had to

2604
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,920
just saying okay by the way I sent that I sent that message on spa pass or was

2605
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:49,400

2606
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:54,420
dark Sakura sky and Loki Saurus I am writing to you from a pseudo email

2607
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:58,080
account for our conversation you can call me track slur I'm a longtime

2608
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:03,080
listener here is my plight I am a 34 year old male gamer living in northwest

2609
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:08,920
Florida I play everything from Batman Arkham City on Xbox to swo tour and while

2610
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:12,880
on PC I make a decent income from working full-time technical job in the

2611
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:17,680
Network Operations Center I'm suffering probably from maybe a newer condition

2612
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:21,800
called gamers loneliness or gamers depression I am an okay looking guy

2613
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:25,860
average weight and height I have money in a car I'm having problems finding a

2614
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:30,680
companion I like women so I'm not alone I've tried POF okay cupid geek to geek

2615
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:34,880
with no success I think it might be my age and the single gamer women are ultra

2616
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:39,020
rare maybe the fact that I don't drink or go to clubs slash bars I do know my

2617
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:42,840
schedule is bad I work Friday to Monday 12-hour shifts with a two-hour commute

2618
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:46,680
to work each day but it's my job to deal with this I've been buying tons of games

2619
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:51,080
that go into my never-ending backlog and buying lots of gamer where my room looks

2620
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:56,320
like a gamers cache now I can have any game I want and have three days off a

2621
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:00,560
week I can game but I'm not any happier I even stopped playing DDR in the air I

2622
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:05,000
kids because I was tired of playing by myself and I stopped getting any

2623
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,520
enjoyment in fact I don't feel happy you're doing anything I've been trying

2624
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:12,760
to do changes from but the results end up the same I don't want to be something

2625
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:15,800
I am NOT just to conform to find someone to be with I wish I could find a

2626
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:20,920
companion like you guys I would marry Dark Soccer's clone thank you I don't

2627
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:25,720
have a clone Dark Soccer is married however I wanted to let you all know

2628
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:28,520
this information because there could be other gamers out there that could be

2629
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:32,240
feeling the way I feel I'm not sure if this is just how the world world

2630
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:35,880
balances us gamers out of future equations reduce population your loyal

2631
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:38,880
listener track slur this message is brought to you by Shermie Skylander

2632
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:48,680
Emporium Wow DB mail okay um that threw me for a little bit of a curveball I I

2633
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:55,480
think it's one of those things where when you kind of let it go that you kind

2634
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:58,840
of have all that hanging over your head like oh my god I need this perfect life

2635
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:03,000
and I need this companion and I need I need all this to happen ABC to happen so

2636
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:07,200
I can be happy no no no you have to learn to be happy with what you've got

2637
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:10,400
and you're kind of like your current situation and then once you kind of have

2638
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:16,680
that about you that that confidence the rest of it will come I think I think I

2639
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:21,600
always say it happens when you stop trying to force it I mean yeah I also

2640
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,560
say things happen when you make them happen but that's like stuff that you

2641
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:31,200
have tangible control over you know like I I can't do this well then go to school

2642
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:36,760
and learn how to do it you know that type of thing in this case you know like

2643
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:41,280
with and I know I've told the story million times we Dan and I hooked up is

2644
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:46,360
that we had just been friends we weren't trying to do anything and he just called

2645
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:52,600
me to cheer me up and we kept talking because it worked and I moved out here

2646
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:58,640
and we worked you know that's just that's like a really rare success story

2647
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:04,520
on top of that you know it was just sort of a faded thing I guess but like I

2648
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:09,920
really think that that a good relationship will find you when you're

2649
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:14,560
not looking for one if that makes sense yeah I mean Alan and I were friends

2650
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,320
online for probably four or five years via live journal just you know and you

2651
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:21,440
know I'm sure he thought you know I was attractive I thought he was attractive

2652
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,840
but it's kind of like yeah he lives in San Francisco it's it's like he lives in

2653
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:27,520
China you know so far away and we never really gave it any thought until one day

2654
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:32,960
it just kind of let's go out sometime and and we did and then it was kind of

2655
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:37,200
like well we're gonna make this work and we did so you know it just it just

2656
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:40,840
happened like I never thought it would and it did you know oh there's somewhere

2657
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:45,600
in the back of my imagination I imagine Nelly going after Loki with the club

2658
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:54,240
isn't that what a girl but you know for real like I I wouldn't like just don't

2659
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:57,640
stress about it like that's I you're only gonna cause yourself like hurt to

2660
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:01,520
do that and I don't think you need to go out to bars or clubs I think you're

2661
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:05,160
doing the right thing just kind of put yourself out there online I would say if

2662
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:08,920
you really feel like you need to go out and do something try maybe like I know

2663
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:11,880
this sounds really weird but try like joining a club or maybe there's a

2664
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:16,560
nonprofit in your area a political cause you can get behind the volunteer you

2665
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:20,080
know something where you you force yourself to get out of the house well

2666
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:24,160
when I lived in Alabama and keep in mind this is when I was effectively single

2667
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:30,800
you know I did a lot of stuff I larped yes I played live-action vampire shut up

2668
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:38,400
there's not else to do in Alabama I I was in band I did jazz band I was in

2669
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:44,480
orchestra you know because I was still a big band nerd I would do ensembles with

2670
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:48,720
other friends I would I played the end oh god that was when I was in eight

2671
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:55,320
games a week for a while and I did there was even I gamed every night every night

2672
02:09:55,320 --> 02:10:00,440
I was in different gaming groups so I mean and I even dated a couple of people

2673
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:05,360
that I gamed with like there was one guy who I was really into for a while but we

2674
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:10,200
just kind of never sort of fun to make out with and you know fun to make out

2675
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:14,800
with good friend you know never that's that's exactly the type of people I met

2676
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:19,520
doing Rocky Horror for so many years it's almost the same kind of thing but I

2677
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:27,120
mean you know if if you're making yourself into some kind of hermit I mean

2678
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:31,000
you're not gonna meet anybody unless you find ways to branch out you have to make

2679
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,800
it yourself and so okay so clubs aren't your deal you know what I hate clubs too

2680
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:41,480
I sometimes go just because I like booze and I like goth music so I'll go hang

2681
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:46,040
out but I don't you know go because I'm well then again I didn't really start

2682
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:50,480
clubbing until I moved out here at all but if that's not your thing then find

2683
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:55,680
you know I I've made friends through my temple for example after I converted and

2684
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,640
I don't know if you're religious or anything but you know there's always

2685
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:04,880
something you can do with like-minded people you know or you know if check out

2686
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:10,320
actually check out YMCA because sometimes they offer not just you know

2687
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:14,120
the little fitness things that they do but they'll have workshops and classes

2688
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:18,520
or you know find something that you're interested in and then put in that topic

2689
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:24,240
and your location and see if you can find groups for it but for and coming

2690
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:26,520
back to this point is I think this is very important I think the first thing

2691
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:29,580
you have to do then we'll stop the advice show I promise but I think the

2692
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:31,920
first thing you have to do is you have to really sit down and say I have a good

2693
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:37,600
life I mean you do have a job you you I don't you know you right but you know

2694
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:41,560
but you you have a lot of stuff that's going for you for you right now you know

2695
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:46,920
you have a you know the things that you're proud of and you know I don't

2696
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:50,080
know this person so it's hard for me to say you know whatever they are into but

2697
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:53,560
there's probably a lot and in the person who says his email you know I'm I

2698
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:58,360
consider myself good-looking you have a lot going for you then you know so love

2699
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:02,680
yourself yeah find the stuff that makes you happy and focus on that you know if

2700
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:07,400
if the games aren't doing it for you anymore then there's another gap mm-hmm

2701
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:12,200
distract yourself but I'm not saying distract yourself in a don't work on the

2702
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:18,100
problem kind of way but I'm sorry reading chat but I was gonna say you

2703
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:25,040
know find new things you know if if your current hobbies not doing it for you

2704
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:30,100
find a new hobby but you have to be out there is the thing if you're gonna try

2705
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,160
to meet somebody you have to be out there and I'll be a hermit

2706
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:42,720
Loki won't be your dating advice my advice is hey you're gonna have a lot of

2707
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:47,480
hookers sometimes it's actually nice to have a lot of free time to play the

2708
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:50,000
games you want to play because you're not gonna have that because once you

2709
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,920
have a baby that all goes away it's all gone that's good advice that's you know

2710
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,320
what and that's that's another way to look at it like I'm not saying like you

2711
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:02,840
know hate on kids or whatever cuz you know but enjoy the life you have while

2712
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:07,840
you have it right yeah so there you go anyway I mean sometimes you know yeah

2713
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,160
it's just like you know however if you want to incorporate sex life and your

2714
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:18,480
video gaming you could try jlist because they have lots of stops honestly I just

2715
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:29,320
go to cons that's not a bad idea why not Chris and Megsy did they meet at a con

2716
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:32,160
that online oh how funny I went to conventions we went to we had that

02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:14,400

02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:28,440

2752
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:54,080
Loki if you do Microsoft Excel that constantly try to outsmart it in order

2753
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:59,640
to get to do what I wanted to have visual basic yeah but see I don't want

2754
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:06,120
to be visual basic that's why music sell all right I don't know I'm actually in a

2755
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:09,060
pretty good mood like I should be giving an F you to the fact that I have to go

2756
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:11,680
back to work tomorrow after being off for like two and a half weeks but I'm

2757
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:15,760
like seriously this is the longest vacation I've had since I started

2758
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,640
working there which was ten years ago which didn't involve me being in the

2759
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:22,360
hospital or having surgery or having the swine flu which happened once and even

2760
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:25,280
that it wouldn't have had the swine flu I'm still sorry about that Rob I was

2761
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:29,840
only out for like two weeks not to have so but I actually like I'm so well

2762
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:34,240
rested and feel so good I'm like I'm actually this weird looking forward to

2763
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:40,240
going back to work so in reality we'll say yes so F you to that all messing

2764
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:43,800
with my mind I do you know what though I'm lucky I'm very fortunate I really do

2765
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:47,840
enjoy my job it's not I I teach people for a living it's a it's a great thing I

2766
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:52,060
love my job I really do and they're not small children it's just sometimes some

2767
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:56,200
of the others you know stuff everybody gets annoyed with their job at some

2768
02:17:56,200 --> 02:18:01,120
point you know because anytime you put a bunch of personalities together and you

2769
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:04,480
know one's in charge or whatever you know things might go but I I have a

2770
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:09,880
great boss I really do my boss is awesome we work so well together I can't

2771
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:14,120
really complain so F you did the fact that I don't take two and a half week

2772
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:17,860
vacations more often because I really should and F you did the fact that the

2773
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:22,680
only way I was able to do it before was getting the swine flu you know what I'm

2774
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:29,720
sorry I need to reward myself more often that's what I I guess that's all right I

2775
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:36,880
didn't know I had it I rubbed AIDS all over the bear I'm just kidding let's

2776
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:47,640
move on Loki all right so Nintendo being the forefront of digital and online

2777
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:56,360
they apparently slapped the wrists of the owner director of icon games

2778
02:18:56,360 --> 02:19:03,960
entertainment and Richard Hill Whithall he apparently has released several games

2779
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:09,960
in the last year on various platforms and he recently shared some sales

2780
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:14,680
numbers on the website gamasutra but then was asked by Nintendo to take down

2781
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:21,000
the numbers for its platforms according to Richard Nintendo doesn't allow

2782
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:25,600
developers to share digital sales numbers for self-published we were in

2783
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:31,120
downloadable ds titles that's kind of interesting and apparently I guess it

2784
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:36,160
hurts smaller developers who I guess need to make those sales numbers known

2785
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:40,960
in order to secure financing and plan out business models and stuff like that

2786
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:46,840
yeah apparently though you can still kind of figure out his numbers because

2787
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:50,280
he gives a total number and then you know the other platforms and do the math

2788
02:19:50,280 --> 02:19:55,360
I have to do math and and and on top of that the numbers weren't so good on the

2789
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:59,320
Nintendo platforms unfortunately so maybe that's why they don't want numbers

2790
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:03,000
out there there's a lot of saturation on the Wii marketplace too and it's really

2791
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,480
hard for games to stand out because the Wii store isn't set up very well you

2792
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:15,320
know yeah all right well we talked a little bit earlier in the show and I

2793
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,720
know Bobby talked a lot on his show tonight of course Bobby black wolf was

2794
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:21,800
on before us at all games radio talked a lot about SOPA and you know the

2795
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:25,160
Internet's been talking a lot about SOPA and I'm sure most of you you know

2796
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:30,520
listening they're gonna scrub it clean of content most of you guys who are tech

2797
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:33,880
savvy enough to download this podcast and listen to it and understand it

2798
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:37,960
probably already have a general awareness about SOPA but this is how

2799
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:41,840
the message might be communicated to those that don't understand SOPA I find

2800
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:47,200
this very interesting apparently they're talking about a huge what they call the

2801
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:52,080
nuclear option to protest SOPA and this is rumored to be happening on January

2802
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:55,400
23rd because the Senate is going to debate this on the 24th and what we're

2803
02:20:55,400 --> 02:21:01,720
talking about is major major websites shutting down essentially for a day you

2804
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:05,920
know replaced with a black screen generally talking about how you know how

2805
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:12,400
soap is bad and all that stuff we're talking AOL, eBay, Facebook, Etsy, Google,

2806
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:18,560
Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Zynga game network this out ties into gaming and

2807
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:22,240
really I mean this is just just anybody who cares about tech has a vested

2808
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:27,160
interest in SOPA and I don't I think I've made this pretty clear as as Loki

2809
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:31,360
as a start soccer but olr is obviously against SOPA and based on the reason

2810
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:36,800
that it gives companies way too much power I understand that people want to

2811
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:40,800
do something about piracy but there has to be I think more accountability in

2812
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:46,160
that regard and SOPA is not really gonna do anything for some sites it's if you

2813
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:49,200
know the numbers you're gonna be able to get on the pirate bag I just don't

2814
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:52,600
understand so I know does it hurt I don't understand that it's almost like

2815
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:57,840
to me like a really terrible web filter that's at like someone's office or

2816
02:21:57,840 --> 02:22:01,880
something like that where it's like oh I can't go to Facebook oh but if I type in

2817
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:06,480
the near the IP address I can go to Facebook if that's all they're doing to

2818
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:10,440
block this and that's kind of stupid you're not supposed to censor the

2819
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:13,920
internet you know what I mean you're not that that's what that's what we read

2820
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:17,880
about and go how can China stand that to have the web censored I mean I

2821
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:22,760
understand it's just a part of you know that country and all that but you know

2822
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:27,640
is that what we want to become here it's just it's it's yucky and I I personally

2823
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:31,880
I I I think the Atari story you kicked off the show with illustrates it per

2824
02:22:31,880 --> 02:22:36,260
perfectly there's gonna be companies that are gonna overreach and the little

2825
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:39,760
people aren't gonna be able to fight them and that's wrong that is so not

2826
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:42,880
what America is supposed to be about well then again we can also detain

2827
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:47,640
people for no good reason well you know that's that's a whole nother Oprah or

2828
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:52,200
so they say but yeah but it's I think it's all related it's it's screwed up

2829
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:56,200
how much power companies have in this country it really is it's getting this

2830
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:59,760
well I don't get political on the show not nearly as often as she does but this

2831
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:02,600
is something that really irritates me and especially when you have all these

2832
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:07,000
video game companies where the ESA has stood against it you know because no

2833
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,440
piracy bad so the ESA stands against it but most of the gaming companies like we

2834
02:23:11,440 --> 02:23:15,100
don't a lot of the gaming companies were reached out to for comment and basically

2835
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:20,440
came back with we don't we don't really do politics we just make games so the

2836
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:28,240
ESA kind of speaks for us what what educate yourself well that's fine if you

2837
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:31,160
don't if you're gonna let someone else but it's for you and it's gonna be those

2838
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:37,440
morons the people that don't understand why this is very bad that are gonna ruin

2839
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:42,280
it it doesn't really affect them I mean as far as their product goes the fact

2840
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:47,440
that they are these big companies that are gonna be able to pull Justin TV

2841
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:51,040
feeds and things that might be critical about their game that ought to be legal

2842
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,680
under fair use when these little reviewers are gonna be able to fight

2843
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:56,960
them that is when they don't even fucking understand the law they just

2844
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:01,400
know they can do it exactly bothers me exactly why do they care then that's the

2845
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:04,520
point it was all you're gonna give us a bunch of power to take down all these

2846
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:09,520
people that we don't like sweet why would I oppose that but of course they're

2847
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:14,520
not gonna say oh yeah we were strongly for that because then people backlash

2848
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:18,000
against them so they got to take you know the on the fence approach or oh

2849
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,760
we're just hands off we'll let them do whatever you know that way they can't

2850
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:26,440
let you know well I think that first sites that can't if people want to add

2851
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:31,200
though I think to the sites that are gonna be down on that day but you can't

2852
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:35,240
necessarily take down you know your server or anything if you've got a blog

2853
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:39,440
or something you know say I've got a couple blogs on blogspot put a big

2854
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:44,320
notice no activity on this day you know don't post on Facebook that day don't I

2855
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:49,520
mean Facebook's gonna be dumb I'm saying don't blog do it because maintain web

2856
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:53,760
silence you know there if you imagine if you can't use Google for a day I mean

2857
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:59,200
that's gonna piss some people off I think that's necessary I think it's

2858
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:04,480
necessary they should all be they should all go down so now let's see what did I

2859
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:08,160
want to say here Oh frisbee in our chat says may I suggest these companies use

2860
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:11,640
ocean marketing to speak for them I realize you're making a joke there but

2861
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:14,480
think about how did that whole thing really how did that whole thing happen

2862
02:25:14,480 --> 02:25:22,400
the guy represented himself as something he kind of wasn't right anyway

2863
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:27,600
Tiger class as I recall two years ago take to send DMCA notices to several

2864
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:32,200
Justin TV channels that were showing GTA 4 when it first came out I believe this

2865
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:38,060
is because they didn't want spoilers being leaked spoilers are gonna get out

2866
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:42,260
there if not in text forms it's just it's silly anyway if you want to do

2867
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:45,760
something about it that's my problem right there though that's not because

2868
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,200
your your copyrights were violated or because someone's you know posting it as

2869
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:54,520
like their own thing it's because oh we don't want spoilers coming out that's

2870
02:25:54,520 --> 02:26:00,320
not a reason to go and say hey I need these videos taken down I'm sorry but

2871
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:03,480
that's like you know review spoiling the end of a book or something like that you

2872
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:06,640
can't you can't force them to take it down because you don't like the fact

2873
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:10,680
that someone spoiled the book all right so anyhow if you want to do something

2874
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:14,640
about SOPA I gotta give props to destructoid to compile this pretty good

2875
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:18,920
article that they have on their website they was posted January 7th talking

2876
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:21,840
about SOPA and they even have kind of some form letters that you can copy

2877
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:25,960
paste although I would kind of encourage you to put your own thing on it I mean a

2878
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:29,180
lot of them prior aren't even gonna get read let's be real but send this to put

2879
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:35,000
on our tumblr to okay I'll do that send that over to you know I'll get props to

2880
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:39,360
destructoid they did and one other thing I like they compiled a list this is very

2881
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:43,320
useful a list of all these game companies where you can contact directly

2882
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:47,040
emails and websites and I thought that was pretty cool so you know you can take

2883
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:52,400
your case to the companies themselves that are supporting this I am do I need

2884
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:58,480
to even say like look at what happened to go daddy and that was who that was a

2885
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:03,000
bit of a mess and talk about a backpedal there I mean seriously oh actually no

2886
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:11,320
we're not a we're against SOPA now yeah right so let me send that over to Rama

2887
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:14,360
and you can put that on the tumblr if you want to read more about that orange

2888
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:20,560
launch radio tumbler calm alrighty let's move on with some more news getting into

2889
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:24,720
some phone calls very soon at 1 877 game olr or a username on skype orange launch

2890
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:28,760
radio but not just yet a few more emails dark Sakura you Suzuki who my husband

2891
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:31,280
has met I have a photo of Dan with you Suzuki

2892
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:37,480
it's very faded now but he said something in an interview with the Toulouse

2893
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:43,480
game show so this is in French and I'm going to read it in French if I can

2894
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:47,760
remember my pronunciation right no pool no to near a license party the Sega

2895
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:52,040
which means we can obtain the license from Sega do you know what they're

2896
02:27:52,040 --> 02:27:59,480
talking about Shenmue so he's not saying that they are actively going to do it

2897
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:03,920
but I think it means that there might be an interest in them trying to obtain it

2898
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:09,280
for a YS net which is his company so maybe it'll happen that would be kind of

2899
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:13,520
cool if it did don't you think very cool if you want I think he should play a

2900
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:21,040
game of lucky hit uh-huh you know all I ever knew that game was play space

2901
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:28,360
Harrier anyway so you can the interview is actually up on YouTube if you want to

2902
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:35,200
find it it's the you Suzuki interview on Shenmue so all right I would be great

2903
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:39,140
I'd love to see that series come back I think a lot of people would I think he

2904
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:44,520
wants to finish it true no it's like he's got a story that's like mostly told

2905
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:53,400
it's got like one chapter left really and what's it out all right Loki you

2906
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:57,360
know I'm actually surprised that this took this long to settle but you

2907
02:28:57,360 --> 02:29:02,480
remember way back when I'm back before you could use USB drives and you know

2908
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:07,720
near Xbox 360 you're limited to their overpriced hard drives and their memory

2909
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:11,280
units which you know really didn't have a lot of space on them and they were

2910
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:16,920
really expensive and a company day tell came out and you know had this wonderful

2911
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:22,600
max memory device you plop a micro SD card into and be able to save your games

2912
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:28,920
to that and everything was peachy keen until Microsoft patched the Xbox 360 to

2913
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:34,360
block these from being used on the device and of course then there was

2914
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:39,360
lawsuits filed and all that fun stuff well they've settled out of court

2915
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:44,200
probably because at this point even if that were to be allowed to be used on

2916
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:48,520
their you know system no one's using the memory cards anymore because it doesn't

2917
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:52,680
work but the consumers who bought these didn't get anything no they got nothing

2918
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:56,640
well hooray to these companies for settling but the consumers got screwed

2919
02:29:56,640 --> 02:30:00,280
didn't they yep what do they get out of it for buying these products that don't

2920
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:04,440
work the satisfaction knowing that you know the US justice system has triumph

2921
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:11,760
well golly gee willikers Loki now I can sleep at night I'm glad you can all

2922
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:16,080
right somebody's celebrating a birthday this week in fact they're turning 30

2923
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:21,560
years old if you can believe it it's the Commodore 64 that's right the Commodore

2924
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:26,480
64 celebrated its 30th birthday this week and all I have to say is man I feel

2925
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:31,840
old because I grew up on the Commodore 64 I remember having one of these I

2926
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:35,720
think we got it Christmas like 83 but the Commodore 64 actually came out in

2927
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:42,680
1982 I love this the whole machine would hold the equivalent of one one hundredth

2928
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:50,960
of an mp3 file $595 is how much these systems cost back in 1982 they say that

2929
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:57,920
is now with inflation $1400 today is how much these things cost it was first

2930
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:03,160
introduced at the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and yeah

2931
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:10,520
boy Commodore 64 now 30 years old and man I love my Commodore 64 so many good

games and those sit chips man so much chiptune stuff the year today is just

2933
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:19,640

2934
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:23,720
these I had a Commodore 64 C we actually broke our original Commodore 64 and we

2935
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:28,960
got a 64 C the white one and that was a pretty awesome machine I was five did

2936
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:32,780
you have when it came out no I told you I didn't have a Commodore 64 I had a

2937
02:31:32,780 --> 02:31:41,480
click Oh Adam with the cassette deck by the way on a related note would you like

2938

2946
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:30,600
that's the first one I don't really recognize that was an Atari game

and it finally broke Oh pole position love pole position Popeye remember that

2951
02:32:54,480 --> 02:33:01,000
and they did a game out of it because Nintendo made it a reactor robotron 2084

2952
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,400
they had a version of that on Xbox Live that was one of the first arcade games

2953
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:06,960
that came out on Xbox Live Q Burt that's another game I played the crap out of

2954
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:11,760
them I know the swearing guy with a long nose everybody thought this had an

2955
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:15,680
awesome name Satan's Hollow it's actually kind of a derpy game but you

2956
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:21,000
know it was a it was the Midway it's on the arcade treasures for Midway and all

2957
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,320
that and it's kind of kind of see in collections but it runs on that same

2958
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:28,080
hardware as like journey and timber and some of those old classic Midway games

2959
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:39,560
sin a star beware I live space duel Star Trek the Sega one time pilot tutankham

2960
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:48,760
Tron is 30 years old and Zaxxon by saying 30 years that's what I need to do

2961
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:57,920
for classic game mm-hmm so there you go now we can all feel old together just

2962
02:33:57,920 --> 02:34:01,520
think in 30 years when we're sitting here on our show celebrating the 40th

2963
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:07,720
anniversary going hey remember you remember the Xbox 360 fucking bastard

2964
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:14,400
stole all my money fucking thing broke after only having it a week I had to

2965
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:21,800
send it in but damn there was some good games all right hopefully by then we're

2966
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:25,000
all playing the holodeck though because remember gaming is just inching forward

2967
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:30,680
slowly to the holodeck all right one eight seven seven game olr or our

2968
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:34,360
username on Skype Skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call

2969
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:39,880
right now and talk to us meanwhile let's do some tweets we will start with a

2970
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:45,240
tweet from ramaditya night says sonic and knuckles I remember back in the day

2971
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:49,760
I used the cheat that allowed me to change sonic to whatever item I want and

2972
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:53,560
cross the wall I found a lot of bugs like a place you were not supposed to be

2973
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:56,160
able to go there spikes all around I wonder if that was so is that like a

2974
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:58,800
code in the game or is that something like a game genie remember the game

2975
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:02,440
genie where you could like hacks or the game I'm sure that is something that

2976
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:07,080
Loki had to own the game genie oh yeah well he's talking about on the game

2977
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:10,040
gene he was talking about sonic and knuckles and some of the things you

2978
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:14,160
could do with that yeah I used to actually sit down all night with my game

2979
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:17,760
genie and my SNES mm-hmm and just try to figure out what different codes by

2980
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:21,600
altering other codes hmm and I found a few ones like ones that turn Mario green

2981
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:26,600
that was it all it did was turn Mario green that's all it does yeah makes

2982
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:30,880
Mario Luigi but not really it turned his skin green all right let's go to the

2983
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:33,360
phones cuz we're getting some calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

2984
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:38,240
hey what's up guys you know hey guys you know what's on your mind buddy not

2985
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:42,040
much I just want to talk about this sober thing I think a lot of us over

2986
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:45,920
reacting first off I don't think it's gonna go through and if it did go

2987
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:49,200
through I don't think it's gonna be that big of a deal I think that a lot of

2988
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:52,880
people are getting worked up and they're freaking out all over nothing I think

2989
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:57,360
pretty much what uh what these companies want to do you know the game companies

2990
02:35:57,360 --> 02:36:02,440
movies music whatever they they just want to make money so pretty much this

2991
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:06,660
law going out is just gonna be a way for them to protect their content and be

2992
02:36:06,660 --> 02:36:09,400
able to put it on their sites and make their type of money that they want to

2993
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:13,640
make I don't think they're necessarily trying to shut down the internet or stop

2994
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:17,700
us from talking on Facebook or any of that kind of stuff well I it's it's a

2995
02:36:17,700 --> 02:36:24,080
fair viewpoint and I understand that but but could it happen to one person I mean

2996
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:27,720
I like again I have to refer to the Atari thing at the beginning of the show

2997
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:30,600
that they're pulling down all these games that they may or may not have the

2998
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:35,320
ability to do and I worry that legal departments of companies who don't

2999
02:36:35,320 --> 02:36:39,080
really understand things might go a little batshit crazy and the problem is

3000
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:42,680
if you leave the door or what's the expression you give them an inch and

3001
02:36:42,680 --> 02:36:47,440
they take a yard I I worry about putting that much power into a corporation's

3002
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:50,360
hand because people you and me can't fight it

3003
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:56,640
yeah true that is I can see a point there I'm not clearly I understand why

3004
02:36:56,640 --> 02:37:00,760
they want to do something about piracy I get it but can you ever really stop

3005
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:07,400
piracy I'm not sure there's no way they can stop it this is I mean I mean I

3006
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:10,120
don't mean to cut you off but I mean if you if you look at the record like as

3007
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:15,280
far as piracy goes like when it comes to um movies and video games a lot of the

3008
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:19,600
stuff that's like highly pirated or also the stuff that sells the most you know

3009
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:26,200
I think music is the only place that actually has a they should really do

3010
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:29,640
something about piracy because I mean you don't have to mod anything on your

3011
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:34,640
system to be able to play the illegal download of music that you download right

3012
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:39,440
so I think the music industry is the one that's taking the real heat from it but

3013
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:44,300
not necessarily the games and the movie industry right you know and I again I

3014
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:48,040
understand they want to do something but I just think this is going to do more

3015
02:37:48,040 --> 02:37:52,720
harm than good because what's it really gonna fix that the IP for the pirate Bay

3016
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:56,360
will be out there within within minutes of this thing passing and everybody will

3017
02:37:56,360 --> 02:38:00,160
have it and there'll be add-ons for Google Chrome and Firefox it will lie

3018
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:06,720
there already are there already are so I mean I just it's not gonna do any good

3019
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:10,840
so I buy but I understand why they want to do something but I think at the end

3020
02:38:10,840 --> 02:38:14,800
of the day it's gonna be accountability you want to prove that someone stole

3021
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:19,360
money from a bank they got to go to court have a trial it's kind of what's

3022
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:22,960
got to happen in this case you know yeah they just they just need to understand

3023
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:25,600
the internet more like they're still trying to treat the internet like if

3024
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:29,840
it's the the real world where it's not doesn't necessarily work like that you

3025
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:35,040
know so I think that they need to seriously look this over they come up

3026
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:38,320
with you know with the better law the better soap or whatever else you want to

3027
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:42,840
call it but um I'm not really that worried about it well I don't know I I

3028
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:49,440
I hope you're right but I I do worry about leaving that opportunity there but

3029
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:54,040
you're a little more optimistic than I so I I applaud you for that so I hope

3030
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:58,440
you're right optimistic to a fault all right anything else you want to share

3031
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:01,160
listeners you guys have a good night all right you too buddy take care of tonight

3032
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:05,400
bye all right you know what it's it's cool that he has a differing opinion and

3033
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:10,900
you know I again I I hope I think he said it best at the end there maybe he's

3034
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:15,680
optimistic to a fault but you know we'll see we'll see actions speak louder than

3035
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:18,700
words so we'll see but I just have a feeling the first time a website gets

3036
02:39:18,700 --> 02:39:24,640
shut down incorrectly it's gonna just all hell's gonna break loose all right

3037
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:27,760
one eight seven seven game all our username on Skype is orange lounge radio

3038
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:32,520
meanwhile we have some more tweets tiger claw on Twitter sends us a tweet one of

3039
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:34,600
them is already about that media molecule thing you already talked about

3040
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:38,800
earlier but the other one is about PlayStation 3 video editing app play

3041
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:43,600
memory studio apparently leaked ahead of CES this might be something that they're

3042
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:48,640
Sony's gonna show at CES and we'll get to that in a minute but we're gonna take

3043
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:50,800
another call while the skype lines lighting up higher on orange launch

3044
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:55,280
radio who's this hey guys do you know DDR dollar bill what's on your mind

3047
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:08,920
getting bad feedback happy new year to you how's this now I'm still hearing it

3048
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:12,520
but it's not it's not killing me get out your question or comment fast we'll try

3049
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:18,920
to make this quick call oh okay which is a quick story a while back I don't know

3050
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:22,200
if I posted by look I said that I stopped playing Wow because I got sick

3051
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:27,600
of all the jackasses kept bitching about everything I kept doing in the game can

3052
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:30,720
you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you yeah people are people are assholes on

3053
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:35,440
the internet unfortunately yeah so for once a long time I pretty much just

3054
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:40,720
quit like whole mmorpgs then I try try a couple other free ones out there and

3055
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:45,600
then I tried out DC Universe when it came out for free uh-huh

3056
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,720
to the point of loving it so much I actually brought the down I should about

3057
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:52,320
DLC sports so you're saying the community in DC Universe online maybe

3058
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:56,980
not so bad um consider that one time I played 130

3059
02:40:56,980 --> 02:41:04,160
more and Ruth making to me we're making jokes about um let's see 16 year olds and

3060
02:41:04,160 --> 02:41:09,560
an all women's squad and everybody's dueling in the middle of nowhere it was

3061
02:41:09,560 --> 02:41:13,720
a lot more fun you know sometimes it's just about finding the right fit for you

3062
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:17,560
and although you know unfortunately a couple jackasses probably ruined Wow for

3063
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:21,100
you and I would argue there's other people in there maybe it just wasn't a

3064
02:41:21,100 --> 02:41:24,480
fit for you after all maybe DC Universe is just you know kind of better I don't

3065
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:27,960
think you have to play one MMO just because it's the popular one you like

3066
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:31,480
what you like there's people out there that fucking play Hello Kitty island

3067
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:35,080
adventure and they fucking love it so you know what let them have their thing

3068
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:38,960
yeah but it goes back to well for one last thing cuz I'm not gonna keep it

3069
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:44,040
short okay after when I got to my finally hit level 30 and DC Universe the

3070
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:49,880
final level I found out that I actually have to group and it made me realize

3071
02:41:49,880 --> 02:41:54,400
that maybe it's okay to group with people once in a while just gotta find

3072
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:58,920
the right group so I went back on Wow I quit this one guild I was with and I

3073
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:03,360
joined up with another guild and was a whole different experience well I have

3074
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:06,440
to perfect story I got I got to hang up on you to your dollar bill though cuz

3075
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:09,720
like the chair I'm saying it sounds like you're living in a hunt bees nest but

3076
02:42:09,720 --> 02:42:15,040
thank you so much buddy have a good one yeah well here's what I was gonna tell

3077
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:19,860
you and just message me in the chat room um is when I started playing well when I

3078
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:24,240
finally liked it again I did not play with other people at all all I did was

3079
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:29,200
chat with the guild and quest by myself and yeah and I've done two characters

3080
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:33,720
that way I did Rebecca black and Iressa both that way but now I've actually got

3081
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:38,680
a character that I am doing nothing but instances with and and maybe you know

3082
02:42:38,680 --> 02:42:44,160
seasonal quests and little things but the point is is that I'm actually trying

3083
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:49,200
to group with other people and I found that actually not every group is full of

3084
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:53,400
idiots a lot of them are many of them don't have proper grammar and they're

3085
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:58,520
very hard to understand but for the most part it's it's partly your support your

3086
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:04,160
support group outside of your pugs you know and people people sometimes just

3087
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:08,060
are kind of weird online like I admit like okay I play with my friend Matt who

3088
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:10,880
is grandpa Warcraft on Horde house if you ever listen to him and when we

3089
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:16,400
group together he does the weirdest shit in instances like he's a friend of mine

3090
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:20,760
and I love them but oh my god like we'll start an instant so like we roll in

3091
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:23,680
instance together and it's the two of us and three random people and as soon as

3092
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:27,080
the instant starts he'll go like he'll say in party chat he'll say something

3159
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:49,000
orange laundry calm speaking of tweets I wanted to finish Tiger Claws thought

3160
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:54,240
here apparently this is coming from a leak at the Sony booth at CES is showing

3161
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:59,440
on the PlayStation 3 something called play memory studio which will be excuse

3162
02:48:59,440 --> 02:49:04,920
me well we're seeing it happen on radio a video editing suite for the PlayStation

3163
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:10,760
3 apparently you can put effects in video and kind of do some editing live

3164
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:14,640
on the PlayStation 3 that's kind of cool I guess I already thought the PlayStation

3165
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:17,640
did kind of allow some limited video stuff but that's cool if they're

3166
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:21,920
enhancing it especially if it's free I wonder if it'll be free I somehow doubt

3167
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:27,040
it Tom and one on Twitter sent us this and I saw this earlier this week cuz

3168
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:30,560

3171
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:54,920
prisoner nice and easy this is actually being rendered from the game it's not

3172
02:49:54,920 --> 02:50:00,000
like a fan-edited thing with the mod of course

3173
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:18,440
it is a thing pure terror

3174

02:50:55,880 --> 02:51:00,120
copies of this of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack on vinyl used to stand

3181
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:06,440
on my bed dancing in my pajamas to disco inferno okay I gave that to Rama for the

3182
02:51:06,440 --> 02:51:09,280
Twitter cuz that that video is just too damn good if you haven't seen yet I also

3185
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:24,480
right and lastly a couple tweets here from Zen monkey 69 tweets us hey 69

3186
02:51:24,480 --> 02:51:29,560
tweets us saying it's 2012 and we have a shitload of video game sequels coming

3187
02:51:29,560 --> 02:51:36,800
what games do you think don't deserve a sequel and should just die what games

3188
02:51:36,800 --> 02:51:41,120
don't deserve a sequel and should just die how about the Imagine series imagine

3189
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:49,120
babies there was one last year for the 3ds that was it one I think Holly would

3190
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:56,080
say the puss in boots game the puss in puts puss in boots series absolutely

3191
02:51:56,080 --> 02:52:03,720
puss in puts tiki a tight tiki I hope I'm saying that right and chat says

3192
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:06,440
Elder Scrolls just throwing it down saying there's too damn many Elder

3193
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:10,040
Scrolls games I'm gonna go on next year is pretty fun yeah you won't have

3194
02:52:10,040 --> 02:52:13,640
another Elder Scrolls game 2012 that's you'll have expansions for Skyrim that's

3195
02:52:13,640 --> 02:52:26,720
for sure yeah for sure I franchises that need to die oh god I like part of you

3196
02:52:26,720 --> 02:52:31,680
wants to be cynical and say the Just Dance series but parties they can be

3197
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:37,840
kind of fun so I can't really think of anything because honestly if I don't

3198
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:40,840
want to play them I just don't know that they exist that's kind of where I'm at

3199
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:45,160
is like I don't think a lot about the games that I don't want to play you know

3200
02:52:45,160 --> 02:52:48,520
I could be super cynical go Call of Duty because I don't play those games but I

3201
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:55,840
realize other people do play those games I'm kind of looking over at my own

3202
02:52:55,840 --> 02:53:00,360
collection how about Tetris remakes yeah that's another one I'm getting sick

3203
02:53:00,360 --> 02:53:03,760
last dress was kind of fun but that's back in the super scope days apparently

3204
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:06,760
that 3ds one's pretty good but it's still the same fucking game we've been

3205
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:14,880
playing forever it might be time for the need for speed series to die maybe that

3206
02:53:14,880 --> 02:53:20,920
would be another answer I would have well or at least of all that or

3207
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:25,720
something I don't know I can't yeah I really can't think of anything offhand I

3208
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:31,320
wonder what our chatters think it chat maybe Saints Row car her her no no yuki

3209
02:53:31,320 --> 02:53:36,080
says cooking mama that's actually a really good answer yeah just the mama

3210
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:41,280
series in general it it's not doing well I that's a very good answer I can stand

3211
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:48,560
with yuki on that one yuki also says sonic games no because generations yeah

3212
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:52,320
I need this game but then I need sonic generation there's admittedly there's

3213
02:53:52,320 --> 02:53:57,040
been a lot of crap yeah and I don't I think that sonic 4 was kind of a I will

3214
02:53:57,040 --> 02:54:01,640
give you one that's just and it is a somewhat major game coming out this year

3215
02:54:01,640 --> 02:54:09,680
okay Silent Hill I think I kind of agree non konami Japan produced Silent Hill

3216
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:15,240
games specifically me today yes to go back in house to Konami Japan I agree

3217
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:19,920
Silent Hill is kind of done and karaoke revolution American or karaoke revolution

3218
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:24,360
glee needs oh there you go winner everything how about everything to die

3219
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:30,880
but glee needs to get canceled all right last another tweet from Zen since I

3220
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:35,160
haven't read tweets from Zen before I will read two tweets tonight Zen says if

3221
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:40,680
PlayStation 4 Xbox lube and the Nintendo Wii U were all coming out on the same

3222
02:54:40,680 --> 02:54:47,520
day and you could only get one which system would you get too early I how can

3223
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:50,040
you answer that because we don't we don't know what the Xbox lube and the

3224
02:54:50,040 --> 02:54:53,240
PlayStation 4 have to offer and we only know about half of what that we use

3225
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:58,800
really bring into the table so you'd be asking me to base that decision based

3226
02:54:58,800 --> 02:55:03,880
off of the current consoles and the problem with that is the jump we made

3227
02:55:03,880 --> 02:55:08,640
from the last realm of consoles right because when the systems first came out

3228
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:12,080
I would say the Xbox 360 was in a better position than the PlayStation 3 was when

3229
02:55:12,080 --> 02:55:15,840
they first came out but yet if I had based my choice completely off that

3230
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:19,440
generation before this one the PlayStation 2 I think was better than

3231
02:55:19,440 --> 02:55:27,120
original Xbox you know so it's just it's it's it's way too early to call I in

3232
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:30,640
here here's also the realistic in me is like well I'm going to end up with them

3233
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:33,480
all anyway because I have the sick addiction of video games and do this

3234
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:36,840
show and everything so it's kind of like I'm going to try to show some restraint

3235
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:43,120
at least maybe not buying one of the consoles if not to the console luck you

3236
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:47,160
know what though honestly with you would have played on the Wii and stuff I think

3237
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:52,360
it's gonna be pretty easy for the Wii U I think I say that now I guess I will

3238
02:55:52,360 --> 02:55:57,000
humor the question and I'm going to say PlayStation 4 and the reason why I

3239
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:00,440
because I just have the feeling out of the three systems it's going to be the

3240
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:04,520
most advanced because I think it's going to be the one that's in the incubator

3241
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:07,320
the longest meaning I think it'll be the last of the three to come out so I think

3242
02:56:07,320 --> 02:56:12,040
it's going to have the best processor in it and all that but again that doesn't

3243
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:15,160
necessarily make it the best but I literally have nothing else to go off of

3244
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:19,860
right now you know so that I'm going to say PlayStation 4 just to humor the

3245
02:56:19,860 --> 02:56:26,280
question but that could change absolutely so alright that's it for the

3246
02:56:26,280 --> 02:56:31,600
Twitter's tonight at twitter.com slash olr oh actually I see one oh never mind

3247
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:35,480
that's somebody new following us thank you on Twitter it's Twitter combines the

3248
02:56:35,480 --> 02:56:39,960
followers and the app messages now it's really weird all right anyway um last

3249
02:56:39,960 --> 02:56:47,920
minute stories Loki dark soccer anything for last minute stories um no Loki um my

3250
02:56:47,920 --> 02:56:51,640
story is that I had trouble finding a cage man sock thankfully I downloaded

3251
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:57,000
one a while ago so that'd be fine and not my preference I they've had some

3252
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:01,080
better songs but I'm gonna put it in anyways all right that's gonna do it

3253
02:57:01,080 --> 02:57:03,680

3255
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:11,280
it's a step wave way way back to the beginning of the show here and we're

3256
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:16,240
talking about best best games of 2011 mm-hmm it's not really a game but I have

3257
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:19,720
to recommend ready player one seriously if you haven't read it yet you need to

3258
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:23,200
read it because it's awesome and I mean if you're a fan of games especially a

3259
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:29,880
fan of classic games you're gonna love this excuse me and I need them to

3260
02:57:29,880 --> 02:57:33,800
actually sign my book that'd be pretty awesome if he's gonna hit a con or

3261
02:57:33,800 --> 02:57:36,400
something well I'm getting coffin fit again I got to say this I think I'm

3262
02:57:36,400 --> 02:57:39,200
allowed to say this because it's it's out there post on the internet but

3263
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:42,400
apparently in Sacramento there's gonna be a group that is going to do a live

3264
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:46,000
shadow casting a la Rocky Horror of Scott Pilgrim versus the world I want

3265
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:50,160
pretty awesome and I can't wait I mean as much as I have kind of a love hate

3266
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:52,560
with that movie there are things I loved about things I didn't like about it I

3267
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:56,400
think that's gonna be awesome because you know that theater is gonna be full

3268
02:57:56,400 --> 02:58:00,640
of nerds that are into it you know and I think it's gonna be a great showing I

3269
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:04,800
want to I definitely I'm gonna see cuz I know the guys that are behind it through

3270
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:08,200
some of the stuff I did last year so I'm gonna see if we can get all our Oh coin

3271
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:15,760
it or something oh from the movie I get it all right anyhow that you talking

3272
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:20,080
about ready player one we're gonna throw quarters ready player one is it has been

3273
02:58:20,080 --> 02:58:22,760
option for a movie but I don't see how the fuck they're gonna be able to do

3274
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:29,040
that but seriously though I'll get you I'm get you ready player one legend

3275
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:32,280
Zaku and chat says oh wow rocky or a picture show finally has competition now

3276
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:36,680
hold on Becky wants to go to there's there Rockies kind of like it's just

3277
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:40,400
there can be more than one movie in the theater at a time and Rockies just

3278
02:58:40,400 --> 02:58:43,720
always there's always more than one cult movie repo the genetic opera for example

3279
02:58:43,720 --> 02:58:47,280
is really big on the midnight circuit right now how do we in the area inch was

3280
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:52,160
for a while I think still is in some places clue the movie will always show

3281
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:54,540
up once a year somewhere you know there's there's other movies that show

3282
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:57,100
up too I don't think it's necessarily about competition usually the same

3283
02:58:57,100 --> 02:59:01,720
people that are in a rocky or in all the other stuff too so anyhow anyhow off

3284
02:59:01,720 --> 02:59:05,480
subject we're trying to wrap up the show I was gonna say thank you very much for

02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:15,920
whatever all we ask tell people about the show spread the word because we're

3288
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:20,340
not a multi-million dollar website we rely on you guys to help spread the word

3289
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:24,160
of orange lounge radio and we really really appreciate it orange launch radio

3290
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:28,560
comm is the website the forums are there if you want to post on the forums I have

3291
02:59:28,560 --> 02:59:33,960
to say though right now it's locked down to new accounts because yeah we were

3292
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:36,800
really getting killed with spammers there so I just shut off accounts all

3293
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:39,320
together so hopefully within the next month or two we're gonna just totally

3294
02:59:39,320 --> 02:59:43,560
revamp the forums and hopefully be able to avoid the spam bots if you really

3295
02:59:43,560 --> 02:59:46,600
want an account on the forums in the meantime email the show directly and
