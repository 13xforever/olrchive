76000	77000	Really wish you could have been here last week
77000	79000	It's alright, you had family stuff going on
79000	81000	Yeah, I had to go eat dinner at some

98000	100000	January the 8th, 2012
100000	102000	So Loki, of course you were out last week
102000	105000	This is the first time you've ever been to my place, I was realizing
105000	106000	That's correct
106000	107000	Because you needed directions on how to get here
107000	108000	Yes
108000	109000	So welcome
109000	111000	I wish you could have seen it before we created a studio
111000	113000	out of what literally was nothing
113000	114000	It's pretty awesome
114000	116000	So, Dark Soccer might be able to remember, I don't know
116000	118000	But, anyhow
118000	119000	How have you been?
119000	120000	This table was loaded with paper
120000	122000	Yes, it was
122000	123000	It was the paper table
123000	124000	How have you been, Loki?
124000	125000	How was your holiday?
125000	126000	Did you have a good time off?
126000	127000	Yeah, it was alright
127000	129000	I mean, we just
129000	131000	Hung around the house for the most part
131000	134000	Just, you know, Josh got a lot of gifts
134000	136000	And, um
136000	140000	In times that he's not awake, I'm playing Skyrim
140000	142000	Very cool
142000	145000	I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
145000	147000	And somebody just joined the chat named
147000	148000	I love OLR
148000	149000	Well, we love you
149000	151000	I love OLR and chat says
151000	153000	Swotore, or as I've been calling it on the other show
153000	154000	Hoard House, Sweatore
154000	156000	Sweatore leveling, which is of course
156000	157000	The Old Republic, Star Wars
157000	159000	Plus, OLR in the background equals
159000	160000	Best Sunday night ever
160000	162000	I gotta admit, that's how I like to listen to live shows
162000	165000	I've tuned into some of the other all-game shows a few times
165000	167000	Like Dead Pixel Live, Video Game Outsiders
167000	168000	And I'll play WoW
168000	171000	Because I've only been playing Sweatore for about three weeks
171000	173000	But like, I'll play WoW and do PVP and listen to
173000	175000	You know, Video Game Outsiders or whatever
175000	176000	It's a good time
176000	178000	I remember when my friend was working on Knights of the Old Republic
178000	180000	And she was calling it Scrotore
180000	183000	You know, it would be awesome if you could do that on the Xbox 360
183000	185000	You know, stream stuff in
185000	188000	Like, you know, one of our live stations
188000	190000	He has the custom, you know, playlists
190000	193000	Didn't somebody create an app that did that some time ago?
193000	195000	I can't remember there was an app years ago
195000	198000	There was, it's the thing for downloading podcasts, sort of
198000	200000	TVercity, TVercity
200000	201000	Didn't that do it?
201000	203000	Well, that, that you can
203000	206000	You can stream stuff to your Xbox 360
206000	209000	But not in the background while you're playing stuff
209000	211000	I believe
211000	212000	I don't know
212000	214000	I don't know about that, maybe you can
214000	215000	I thought one of them did internet radio
215000	217000	Maybe you can do that with TVercity
217000	219000	I know, I just use it for videos
219000	221000	So I don't really, I've never messed with the music part of it
221000	224000	I know this would never ever happen
224000	227000	But wouldn't it be nice if AllGames.com
227000	229000	Could get one of those little channel things
229000	231000	That you could install and have
231000	233000	I mean, iHeartRadio, the Clear Channel thing has one
233000	235000	I mean, they have millions and billions of dollars
235000	238000	But AllGames totally has a 20 somewhere
238000	240000	Maybe in the couch
240000	243000	I mean, AllGames should be able to get that, right?
248000	249000	Anyhow
249000	252000	Let's see, Loki, we gotta do some catching up here
252000	254000	You were out last week, and last week was the big show
254000	256000	We were talking about our top games of 2011
256000	258000	Because we never really had a proper year-end show
258000	260000	Because of the way the holidays fell this year
260000	262000	And we all were speculating
262000	265000	What is Loki's top three games of 2011?
265000	267000	Hey, come on, it's gonna be super easy
267000	268000	Dark Soccer and I guessed
268000	270000	We actually, we already have a listener of mine
270000	272000	I think I remember, I remember three and one
272000	274000	Oh yeah, yeah, I think, I don't remember
274000	276000	Maybe one of the listeners will remind us in the chat room
276000	278000	What we had picked, but I don't wanna say
278000	280000	Because I don't wanna influence, so we'll wait
280000	282000	Loki, let's hear your top three games
282000	285000	So number three, what did you think was the third best game of 2011?
285000	288000	You know, I don't know, because I didn't play a lot of games
288000	291000	In 2011, sadly, because I just
291000	294000	I was really playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto the whole
294000	297000	Well, for the most part, up until recently
297000	300000	But that's not, that didn't come out in 2011
300000	301000	So that doesn't count
301000	304000	We did allow, it was, the criteria was
304000	306000	Your top game of the year
306000	308000	And that might not actually be a game that came out this year
308000	310000	Because so many good games come out at the end of 2010
310000	314000	Or in Alan's case, he put Dragon Age Origins as his number two game of the year
314000	316000	Because he just started playing it this year
316000	318000	And we said, okay, you're allowed
318000	320000	Every gamer gets their voice, even if it's a tardy voice
320000	322000	Well, that's tough, and I would say
322000	324000	I mean, Grand Theft Auto was pretty awesome
324000	328000	And, I mean, it was nice to be able to play the mods again
328000	331000	Briefly, until they patched it again
333000	336000	I would say probably my number three would be
336000	340000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare, I guess
340000	341000	All right, we called it
341000	343000	Did we call it? I think we did, yeah
343000	344000	Yeah, Modern Warfare
344000	346000	It's just fun now
346000	349000	And especially because, you know, the whole reason we switched to that game
349000	351000	Is because my co-workers were very pissed
351000	356000	Or tired of me beating them in Grand Theft Auto
356000	358000	And they're just like
358000	361000	They're just like, oh, we gotta switch it up, we gotta play a game
361000	362000	You know, my boss
362000	364000	Oh, I've played Call of Duty, you know
364000	368000	I think I should be a little bit better than Loki is at that
368000	370000	Unfortunately, what they found out
370000	373000	And, see, I didn't play a lot of Call of Duty at all
373000	376000	I mean, I've literally, before we started playing it
376000	382000	I'd played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1 once
382000	384000	Once split screen, and that was it
384000	388000	And I didn't really care for it the first time we played it
388000	392000	But I ended up being really good at it, apparently
392000	394000	And a lot better than them
394000	397000	And they are pissed
397000	399000	Because it didn't help
399000	402000	And it's actually been a lot worse now
402000	405000	Because I'm so stealthy in that game
405000	407000	That I'll just sneak up behind them and do something funny
407000	409000	And they'll be like, hey, hey
409000	410000	And then kill them
410000	412000	Alright, so you like this game because you can own the shit out of everybody
412000	414000	It's pretty fun
414000	417000	It's actually, Call of Duty, at least the Modern Warfare games and stuff
417000	419000	I mean, they really cater that stuff
419000	421000	Especially the multiplayer portion
421000	423000	But they really have it down pat
423000	426000	And it's smooth, it works well
426000	429000	And it's just very fun and streamlined
429000	430000	It's good
430000	432000	That's not a series of games
432000	434000	I'm not really into the war games
434000	436000	I'm terrible at first person shooters unless it's called Quake
436000	438000	But you know what though
438000	441000	And I agree, playing it online
441000	443000	Like free for all deathmatch
443000	444000	Not very fun
444000	446000	Playing it team deathmatch online
446000	447000	That's a lot of fun
447000	449000	Well yeah, I watched
449000	451000	I didn't talk about this last week
451000	453000	But I actually watched over the holiday
453000	455000	We were with some of Alan's family
455000	457000	And some of his brothers were playing
457000	459000	Modern Warfare 3
459000	461000	And I was kind of watching them like, wow, it looks really good
461000	463000	And they were doing this interesting playback thing
463000	465000	Where he was showing us a video
465000	467000	Where his whole team hid in a bus
467000	469000	And the other team was looking for him everywhere
469000	471000	And couldn't find him
471000	473000	And it took him like 10 minutes or something
473000	475000	To find the team that was in the bus
475000	477000	Because this one guy inadvertently stood up
477000	479000	I get why people are into this
479000	481000	It's actually a pretty fun game
481000	483000	There's a lot of haters
483000	485000	A lot of hate for Modern Warfare
485000	488000	And I can't really speak for 2 and 3
488000	490000	Because I haven't played 2 and 3
490000	492000	So I don't know how much they've changed
492000	495000	But I can only imagine it's about as much as they've changed
495000	497000	From Call of Duty 2 to 3
497000	499000	Which wasn't a whole lot
499000	501000	It was just pretty much
501000	503000	They have the game and that's it
503000	506000	I know a lot of it's catered towards multiplayer nowadays
506000	508000	But you know what?
508000	510000	It's pretty fun
510000	512000	I like what they were talking about
512000	514000	That they were doing with the elite services
514000	516000	I can see where people would like that
516000	518000	But my whole thing before was
518000	520000	Just getting into online actually playing free for all death matches
520000	522000	And stuff
522000	524000	It doesn't seem very fun
524000	526000	And I've actually played it
526000	528000	And I don't know, there's still a lot of people cheating online
528000	530000	You run into a lot of people running infection mods
530000	532000	And stuff like that
532000	534000	But Team Deathmatch actually doesn't seem to be plagued with that crap
534000	536000	So it seems a lot more fun that way
536000	538000	And I actually do pretty well
538000	540000	Considering I'm ranked 5
540000	542000	That's pretty low
542000	544000	When you consider there's 11
544000	546000	Well, 11 prestigious
546000	548000	Or 10 prestigious
548000	550000	And you can level up again on 10th prestige
550000	552000	And 55 levels per
552000	554000	And people actually do level up
554000	556000	I'm not sure if everyone does it legitimately
556000	558000	So it's fun
558000	560000	Let's move on to your number 2 choice
560000	562000	Number 2, best game of 2011
562000	564000	It's tough because this game
564000	566000	A couple weeks ago
566000	568000	Might have been number 1
568000	570000	But it's not
570000	572000	Because it's kind of like
572000	574000	It's kind of like an actual person
574000	576000	Sort of, Elder Scrolls Skyrim
576000	578000	2 for 2, Dark Sakura
578000	580000	And the reason why
580000	582000	Elder Scrolls Skyrim is number 2
582000	584000	And not number 1
584000	586000	Is because the longer you play it
586000	588000	The worse it gets
588000	590000	And it's not necessarily that the game is getting worse
590000	592000	It's just it's getting buggier
592000	594000	It's just it took an arrow to the knee
594000	596000	It's seriously getting buggier and buggier
596000	598000	That meme needs to die right now
598000	600000	Right now
600000	602000	It needs to self inflict an arrow in its own knee
602000	604000	I want to know why there's no representing the love
604000	606000	For, there's a guy that says
606000	608000	He took a sword to the chest
608000	610000	Huh? I don't see any sword to the chest
610000	612000	Yeah, let me say arrow to the knees guy, you sound like a pussy
612000	614000	Sword to the chest?
614000	616000	You don't come back from that
616000	618000	He did apparently
618000	620000	So
620000	622000	Yeah, it's gotten progressively buggier
622000	624000	In fact I was complaining about it the other day on Facebook
624000	626000	Um
626000	628000	There's a quest I can't finish now because
628000	630000	The NPC for the quest is spawned under the map
630000	632000	And
632000	634000	I can't get to them
634000	636000	It's literally in a spot that is inaccessible
636000	638000	Alan got a pretty amazing bug this week
638000	640000	I should have him come on and explain it
640000	642000	I'm gonna butcher this
642000	644000	Hopefully he hears, oh here he comes, yeah
644000	646000	Alan hears me struggling
646000	648000	What kind of Skyrim bug you got this week?
648000	650000	So when I go to
650000	652000	Whiterun, which is the main city in the center
652000	654000	The first major city you go to
654000	656000	I'm not a criminal
656000	658000	I don't have a bounty
658000	660000	I could talk to guards, they're like, oh hey sup bro
660000	662000	Like you're orcish armor
662000	664000	I go into Dragon's Reach where the Jarl is
664000	666000	And right when I go up the stairs
666000	668000	The Jarl and his bodyguard are like
668000	670000	Oh shit, get him
670000	672000	And like the whole room agros
672000	674000	And I'm like, I'm dead, I didn't do anything
674000	676000	So I left
676000	678000	And I just did other shit for like 8 hours
678000	680000	And I went back
680000	682000	And it's fine
682000	684000	It's fine now, so I can use the enchanting table in there
684000	686000	But I was like, that was weird
686000	688000	Magically fixed itself, fantastic
688000	690000	I love this comment in our chat room
690000	692000	Zenthral says, the guy that invented that mem
692000	694000	The arrow to the knee thing, needs to take a sack to the chin
694000	696000	Okay
696000	698000	The arrow to the knee thing, yeah
698000	700000	We get it, the NPCs
700000	702000	Repeat themselves a lot
702000	706000	Hell, I mean all the shopkeeps say the same thing too
706000	708000	Some consider this trash
708000	710000	I consider them treasures
710000	712000	Well considering how fucking vast that game is though
712000	714000	I mean
714000	716000	I don't know
716000	718000	It's just
718000	720000	It's
720000	722000	It's getting incredibly buggy
722000	724000	And to the point where it's actually breaking the game
724000	726000	But I mean
726000	728000	It's still fun, I'm still playing
728000	730000	I had to kind of force myself not to play this week
730000	732000	So I can get some other stuff done
732000	736000	Because I have over 85 hours in the game now
736000	740000	And although I have exploited pretty much every glitch possible in the game
740000	744000	To level myself up to the point where I can't die anymore
744000	746000	And I kill everything in one hit
746000	748000	And it's still fun
748000	752000	And I can sneak up right to somebody in plain daylight
752000	754000	And be standing right in front of them and they can't see me
754000	756000	Which is kind of fun
756000	758000	But yeah, the fact that I can't finish that quest
758000	760000	That sucks, and the fact that sometimes
760000	762000	Parts of the land don't spawn
762000	764000	And I can't, you know, I fall through them
764000	766000	Or uh
766000	768000	Other fun stuff, oh
768000	770000	Sometimes when you kill a dragon or whatever
770000	774000	It'll do one more lap around the sky and then crash epically
774000	776000	You know, it's just like
776000	778000	Really? You have to do that
778000	780000	You can just die and fall to the ground
780000	782000	Alright, so despite all the crappy bugs
782000	784000	It's still your number two game of the year because
784000	786000	I played it a lot
786000	788000	And I'm still playing
788000	790000	Alright, your number one game of twenty
790000	792000	I mean, come on
792000	794000	Seriously, you gotta ask
794000	796000	What is your number one game of 2011?
796000	798000	Let's say it's World of the Third
798000	800000	Ah, three for three, right there
800000	802000	Actually, didn't we go back and say though
802000	804000	That Earth Defense Force was gonna end up number three?
804000	806000	Yeah, but then we allowed the old game rule
806000	808000	Yeah, alright
808000	810000	See, if it wasn't the old game rule
810000	812000	I probably would have been number three
812000	814000	Only by default because
814000	816000	They sucked
816000	818000	And Earth Defense Force, it was all right
818000	820000	It was pretty fun for a while, but man
820000	822000	It's pretty boring now
822000	824000	They promised, oh, we're gonna deal with this TLC
824000	826000	It's gonna be so fucking awesome
826000	828000	And nothing
828000	830000	Why Saints Row the Third?
830000	832000	It's such an over the top game
832000	834000	It's just incredibly fun
834000	836000	It was everything I wanted that game to be
836000	838000	And more
838000	840000	Honestly, I wanna finish it
840000	842000	And get all a thousand achievement points
842000	844000	But I just, once again, there's
844000	846000	A buggy portion of the game
846000	848000	And it happens to be kind of like the terrible part of it
848000	850000	Where you have to do these car jacking things
850000	852000	And steal certain cars
852000	854000	To unlock stuff
854000	856000	It's on their Saints book thing
856000	858000	It's just broken
858000	860000	And if it wasn't broken
860000	862000	I probably would be done with that
862000	864000	Well, with all the achievements at least
864000	866000	Sad there wasn't any competitive multiplayer in it
866000	868000	I mean, that's kinda lame
868000	870000	I do really wanna play the
870000	872000	Co-op in it
872000	874000	I think that would be pretty fun
874000	876000	I do have to play through it again now
876000	878000	As a woman so I can get the other achievements
878000	880000	And the DLC
880000	882000	I'm looking forward to it
882000	884000	Although I'm not too optimistic
884000	886000	On if it being really good
886000	888000	Cause the new, like from the achievements
888000	890000	That were leaked out for the
890000	892000	Upcoming stuff
892000	894000	It just sounds like a bunch of extra excursions
894000	896000	And some of it, I mean, that would probably be pretty fun
896000	898000	But, you know
898000	900000	The activities
900000	902000	It's cool doing them sometimes
902000	904000	But I don't like being forced to doing them
904000	906000	I would rather have some actual missions to the game
906000	908000	But it just sounds like it's all activities
910000	912000	So, we'll try it
912000	914000	I mean, it'll be alright
914000	916000	But I'm not gonna be one of those persons
916000	918000	And I haven't been
918000	920000	I'm not gonna be one to buy every single piece of download content
920000	922000	Just because I like the game
922000	924000	That's not how I'm gonna do it
924000	926000	Alright, so you're number one game of the year
926000	928000	Number three, and then you proceeded to slam each game
928000	930000	There it is, your top three
930000	932000	Of the year
932000	934000	Can you get, Dark Soccer and I
934000	936000	Have the same game as number one, can you guess?
936000	938000	The same game as number one
938000	940000	World of Warcraft?
940000	942000	No
942000	944000	Good guess though
944000	946000	Star Wars the old
946000	948000	No, I'm not playing that
948000	950000	I showed Dark Soccer it for five minutes
950000	952000	And she was like, I don't get it
952000	954000	No, I got it, I just didn't really care
954000	956000	Number one game
958000	960000	Better not be something like The Sims Social
960000	962000	No, God no
962000	964000	Think more, it'll be easier to guess her
964000	966000	Here's a clue
966000	968000	Oh, it's you
968000	970000	How have you been?
970000	972000	I've been really busy being dead
972000	974000	Oh my God, I forgot Portal 2
974000	976000	Fuck that, Call of Duty is out of this
976000	978000	See, that's what happens when that comes out way too early
978000	980000	Call of Duty, fuck it
980000	982000	Move them all back
982000	984000	Portal 2 number one, all the rest can be
984000	986000	Skyrim number three
986000	988000	Saints Row the Third
988000	990000	So there we go, so after
990000	992000	Some coercing, we finally get Loki to agree
992000	994000	So it's official, the official OLR game of 2011
994000	996000	Is Portal 2
996000	998000	I played through that game what, four times all the way through?
998000	1000000	It's great
1000000	1002000	I completely forgot that that game came out
1002000	1004000	This year, and that's really bad
1004000	1006000	Because I think a lot of the
1006000	1008000	Game of the Year stuff, I mean a lot of people
1008000	1010000	Talked about Portal 2, but
1010000	1012000	I literally forgot that that came out this year
1012000	1014000	Well, and you know
1014000	1016000	I actually have that, oh, it's you
1016000	1018000	Memorized very well, because that's my
1018000	1020000	Message tone on my phone now
1020000	1022000	Yeah, so I mean, yeah, Portal 2
1022000	1024000	For sure
1024000	1026000	I completely forgot
1026000	1028000	I feel so bad
1028000	1030000	But seriously, where the fuck is
1030000	1032000	Where the fuck is some DLC for that?
1032000	1034000	They had some of the stuff on the PC
1034000	1036000	Any other guesses
1036000	1038000	What might have been on our list?
1038000	1040000	Technically
1040000	1042000	Um
1042000	1044000	Final Fantasy XIV
1044000	1046000	Hell to the no
1046000	1048000	That would be in like three biggest
1048000	1050000	Disappointments of the year
1050000	1052000	Super Mario 3D Land
1052000	1054000	You got it, it was my number three
1054000	1056000	Mario Kart 7
1056000	1058000	Arkham City was my number two
1058000	1060000	Arkham City was my number three
1060000	1062000	What was your number two? I forgot
1062000	1064000	Um
1064000	1066000	Hold on, I actually have
1066000	1068000	No, I
1068000	1070000	I'll have to check on my hard drive
1070000	1072000	Because I
1072000	1074000	Spazinator says the number one game was Singstar Abba
1074000	1076000	L-O-O-J-K
1076000	1078000	I know what my, um
1078000	1080000	Wrong, it's not Singstar Abba, it's Abba, you can dance
1080000	1082000	He was so hilarious playing that
1082000	1084000	No, but they also have Singstar Abba on the PS3
1084000	1086000	I know that
1086000	1088000	I remember that Tiara was in town when you got that
1088000	1090000	And we came and played it at the old house
1090000	1092000	But, um
1092000	1094000	I know what my honorable
1094000	1096000	Mention was, Fractal
1096000	1098000	Because that game is cool
1098000	1100000	Fractal is a really neat puzzler
1100000	1102000	Alright, oh Marvel vs. Capcom
1102000	1104000	Yeah, Marvel vs. Capcom
1104000	1106000	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
1106000	1108000	It just hit me, all of a sudden
1108000	1110000	Alright, let's
1110000	1112000	Uh, quickly, our intro is running a little long
1112000	1114000	I wanted to just quickly say something about this
1114000	1116000	Because, Loki, you tweeted it to me
1116000	1118000	I've had listeners tweet me more stories
1118000	1120000	About this whole Xbox hacking stuff
1120000	1122000	And, god, we've been talking to our
1122000	1124000	Blue in the face about it since August
1124000	1126000	You know, if you don't know by now
1126000	1128000	Uh, I was hacked back in August
1128000	1130000	And people were saying, oh, you let
1130000	1132000	Your password get out, oh, you got phish
1132000	1134000	Microsoft's saying, oh, you got phish, I'm like, no
1134000	1136000	I'm a little smarter than that in the websites I visit
1136000	1138000	But, no, apparently it was my own damn fault
1138000	1140000	Well, now that more and more people are getting hacked
1140000	1142000	And more and more people are having problems with Microsoft
1142000	1144000	Finally, it's getting out there, some gal has set up a Tumblr
1144000	1146000	Where she was sharing her experiences
1146000	1148000	For some reason, it caught wildfire
1148000	1150000	And I think a lot of it is because
1150000	1152000	She had screen caps with Xbox support
1152000	1154000	She was screen capping the emails
1154000	1156000	And it gave a lot of the gaming press, I guess, for whatever reason
1156000	1158000	They're really, really bored
1158000	1160000	What really was taking me off this week
1160000	1162000	And you linked me an article from IGN
1162000	1164000	That literally said nothing
1164000	1166000	Literally said nothing, it said, yeah
1166000	1168000	Xbox is claiming that they're getting hacked
1168000	1170000	But, Microsoft says
1170000	1172000	They have no comment on the situation
1172000	1174000	So, you know
1174000	1176000	And apparently
1176000	1178000	This guy on this website
1178000	1180000	Was the first to break the news
1180000	1182000	A couple weeks ago, and it's like
1182000	1184000	That's kind of insulting
1184000	1186000	When we were here in August, talking about
1186000	1188000	I'm not saying we should, that's not what I'm saying
1188000	1190000	Because there were probably way other people
1190000	1192000	Before me, in fact I know people who were hacked
1192000	1194000	Before me
1194000	1196000	It's just irritating
1196000	1198000	That it's not news until it happens to somebody
1198000	1200000	Who has
1200000	1202000	Listen, just because a dude works in an office
1202000	1204000	For a company that makes a lot of money
1204000	1206000	Doesn't mean he's any better than any other blogger
1206000	1208000	I mean, there's a lot of really stupid ass posts
1208000	1210000	That are on a lot of major websites
1210000	1212000	IGN
1212000	1214000	Especially
1214000	1216000	That have not a lot of research in there
1216000	1218000	And, I mean, I think they got
1218000	1220000	The comment from, what is it
1220000	1222000	Steven Toulouse, or whatever his name is
1222000	1224000	Support, I don't know what the hell he is
1224000	1226000	Something that Xbox put
1226000	1228000	That customer service related
1228000	1230000	I'm not going to touch on Blowing the Fate
1230000	1232000	Go listen to that last show from 2011
1232000	1234000	Episode number four
1234000	1236000	How old night are we on tonight?
1236000	1238000	441
1238000	1240000	Go listen to 439
1240000	1242000	Would have been the last one from, we had Justin on
1242000	1244000	Who was talking about how he got
1244000	1246000	Broken into twice
1246000	1248000	Go, I mean, that's really all you need to hear
1248000	1250000	And I don't want to keep talking about this
1250000	1252000	But seriously, if you have not changed your password
1252000	1254000	At this point, do not
1254000	1256000	Microsoft is swearing up and down
1256000	1258000	That they're doing everything
1258000	1260000	They're being ignorant
1260000	1262000	That's really the only word
1262000	1264000	Microsoft is ignorant
1264000	1266000	EA is ignorant
1266000	1268000	The higher ups in those companies are ignorant
1268000	1270000	To the situation that's going on right now
1270000	1272000	Your money is at risk if your credit card is on your account
1272000	1274000	I have been sitting here telling you this
1274000	1276000	Blue in the face since August
1276000	1278000	Change your F and password, it's not that hard to do
1278000	1280000	Use a unique password on Xbox
1280000	1282000	That you don't use anywhere else
1282000	1284000	Put, like, put XB at the end of it
1284000	1286000	Or something, or put, you know
1286000	1288000	MS with a dollar sign
1288000	1290000	Just make something that differentiates it
1290000	1292000	For the record, neither of us have been hacked
1292000	1294000	It's, it's, the thing is though
1294000	1296000	Is, once again, they
1296000	1298000	Um, but
1298000	1300000	They're right, and they're wrong at the same time
1300000	1302000	I think Dan always paid with points cards
1302000	1304000	And also, hundreds and thousands
1304000	1306000	Of people have been, you know
1306000	1308000	And including people I know that haven't touched
1308000	1310000	Their Xboxes in forever
1310000	1312000	Well, I'm just saying it's safer to
1312000	1314000	Pay with points cards
1314000	1316000	The only card I have ever had on there
1316000	1318000	Was one that I knew was gonna expire in a month that I wasn't
1318000	1320000	Gonna renew
1320000	1322000	I would still change your password
1322000	1324000	You might have people in there downloading
1324000	1326000	What they can do, they can transfer
1326000	1328000	They might not charge anything, but what a lot of them
1328000	1330000	Have been doing, have they been logging
1330000	1332000	In and then downloading the licenses
1332000	1334000	To their local Xboxes
1334000	1336000	And basically siphoning all your games
1336000	1338000	Which can cause you headaches later on
1338000	1340000	I'm just saying
1340000	1342000	Well, I've checked all my licenses and they're still on mine
1342000	1344000	But I've also never had gold on my
1344000	1346000	Account either
1346000	1348000	Now, Microsoft's not
1348000	1350000	I wouldn't say they're ignorant
1350000	1352000	But what their statement is true
1352000	1354000	It's just, okay
1354000	1356000	Here's what it is
1356000	1358000	They're saying basically two things
1358000	1360000	One, Live.com has not been compromised
1360000	1362000	And two, that
1362000	1364000	People are being phished
1364000	1366000	And that's how their
1366000	1368000	Credentials are being
1368000	1370000	Leaked out or compromised
1370000	1372000	There's two things that are
1372000	1374000	I mean, yes, true
1374000	1376000	They are not
1376000	1378000	Live.com is not compromised
1378000	1380000	But people are not being phished
1380000	1382000	The whole thing was
1382000	1384000	All this stuff is coming from the hacks
1384000	1386000	That happened a while back and I even think it was
1386000	1388000	The anonymous stuff where they were dumping
1388000	1390000	A bunch of, and it might not even necessarily
1390000	1392000	Be them, but something similar to
1392000	1394000	The fact where they dump the email passwords
1394000	1396000	Combos
1396000	1398000	From random forums
1398000	1400000	Or even gaming websites or whatever
1400000	1402000	EA may have even been one of those, I don't know
1402000	1404000	I think EA is the weak link
1404000	1406000	And I've been saying this for forever
1406000	1408000	Why does every single hack seem to come back
1408000	1410000	To one of the EA games
1410000	1412000	And I get FIFA 12's gold pack thing
1412000	1414000	Where they're taking the cards and trading with other accounts
1414000	1416000	That whole thing, I get that
1416000	1418000	But why, if
1418000	1420000	All these accounts are being sold on a Polish
1420000	1422000	Website or all these accounts
1422000	1424000	Are being bought and sold on there
1424000	1426000	Why are they not selling accounts
1426000	1428000	With other games too
1428000	1430000	Why does it always come back to FIFA
1430000	1432000	Because FIFA is a popular game
1432000	1434000	In other countries
1434000	1436000	There's other popular games in other countries
1436000	1438000	Why is it always freaking FIFA
1438000	1440000	But the DLC for FIFA is a lot more
1440000	1442000	Expensive than buying a map pack for Call of Duty
1442000	1444000	Or something
1444000	1446000	Where there's smoke there's fire and it seems like
1446000	1448000	FIFA is the common thing between
1448000	1450000	All this, there's something about that game
1450000	1452000	Or EA servers that are allowing this to happen
1452000	1454000	EA sells a lot of garbage DLC
1454000	1456000	People buy it
1456000	1458000	And it's worth more
1458000	1460000	That's really what it's coming down to
1460000	1462000	But it doesn't matter
1462000	1464000	You should be using a unique password
1464000	1466000	And email combination
1466000	1468000	On Xbox
1468000	1470000	That's pretty much what
1470000	1472000	You have to do
1472000	1474000	Let's assume that even
1474000	1476000	Right now they're claiming
1476000	1478000	Phishing
1478000	1480000	What evidence do they have that there's actual phishing
1480000	1482000	Going on? They have no evidence
1482000	1484000	They're just making assumptions
1484000	1486000	Because all they know is
1486000	1488000	It's gotta be phishing
1488000	1490000	But what they should do is
1490000	1492000	Listen, hey, you know
1492000	1494000	I think I've seen one of them say that
1494000	1496000	Someone that was associated with
1496000	1498000	Xbox said, hey, you know
1498000	1500000	There were these hacks that happened
1500000	1502000	A lot of this email password
1502000	1504000	Combos got out
1504000	1506000	And what they're doing
1506000	1508000	In fact, Anonymous said to do this
1508000	1510000	When they leaked this crap out
1510000	1512000	Try it in Facebook, try it in Yahoo
1512000	1514000	Try it in Gmail, try it in Twitter
1514000	1516000	Use these login credentials
1516000	1518000	To get in access to other people's stuff
1518000	1520000	Because these people should be changing their accounts
1520000	1522000	Because these websites got hacked
1522000	1524000	So that's what it is
1524000	1526000	You need to change that stuff
1526000	1528000	Because if you use the same email
1528000	1530000	And password combination
1530000	1532000	Or even username password
1532000	1534000	For every single website that you visit
1534000	1536000	Then you're gonna
1536000	1538000	If someone gets one of those, they've got them all
1538000	1540000	Alright, so again
1540000	1542000	We've spent way too much time talking about this
1542000	1544000	In the past on the show
1544000	1546000	If you tweet me and say
1546000	1548000	My Xbox got hacked, I'm gonna tweet you back
1548000	1550000	And say, I'm really sorry to hear that
1550000	1552000	But I told you to change your password in August
1552000	1554000	Now if you tweet me back and say, I changed my password
1554000	1556000	Back in August, I really do want to hear those
1556000	1558000	Because then that would prove
1558000	1560000	Something fishy's going on
1560000	1562000	I'm not talking fishing
1562000	1564000	But if you haven't
1564000	1566000	Changed your password by now
1566000	1568000	I don't know what else to tell you
1568000	1570000	Like, the evidence is out there
1570000	1572000	It's growing
1572000	1574000	And finally, the mainstream press
1574000	1576000	Is coming around
1576000	1578000	And telling you to change your password too
1578000	1580000	So just do it
1580000	1582000	Even though Microsoft and EA and all of them are refusing to admit there's a problem
1582000	1584000	It's clear that there's a problem
1584000	1586000	Alright
1586000	1588000	Let's see
1588000	1590000	Moving on
1590000	1592000	I want to talk about our gaming weeks
1592000	1594000	And we always like to start off the show
1594000	1596000	Even when it's really 30 minutes into the show
1596000	1598000	Talking about what video games have you been playing this week
1598000	1600000	There's been things that you've been playing
1600000	1602000	DarkSakura, what have you been up to?
1602000	1604000	Well, I have been playing WoW
1604000	1606000	But I've been reading books
1606000	1608000	WoW books
1608000	1610000	And I was at Goodwill
1610000	1612000	Someone had the first two books of the War of the Ancients series
1612000	1614000	And I was like, I'm kind of a lore nerd
1614000	1616000	I'll read them
1616000	1618000	They're really well written
1618000	1620000	I mean, I can
1620000	1622000	A lot of books that you get that are tie-ins to series
1622000	1624000	Are kind of like, oh meh
1624000	1626000	These are actually really good books
1626000	1628000	And that's just reading it
1628000	1630000	You know, in between times
1630000	1632000	Really good books
1632000	1634000	I also
1634000	1636000	Played some Fractal
1636000	1638000	And I installed Bastion
1638000	1640000	I haven't played it yet
1640000	1642000	But it's really been Fractal and WoW
1642000	1644000	And we picked up DJ Hero 2 today
1644000	1646000	The girl installed the game
1646000	1648000	But she couldn't find the time
1648000	1650000	We got DJ Hero 2 today
1650000	1652000	The bundle set
1652000	1654000	For 20 bucks at Big Lots
1654000	1656000	So that's what tomorrow was
1656000	1658000	Woohoo bargaining
1658000	1660000	I know, right
1660000	1662000	And I've also been playing Scare Shermie
1662000	1664000	Which was
1664000	1666000	I finally figured out how to sneak up on Shermie
1666000	1668000	Vacuum something in front of her
1668000	1670000	She's too busy staring at it
1670000	1672000	In absolute horror
1672000	1674000	You can actually sneak up on her
1674000	1676000	And she'll jump
1676000	1678000	I think I saw a tweet
1678000	1680000	Or a chat comment or something earlier
1680000	1682000	That said, I miss Shermie
1682000	1684000	There are two cats here
1684000	1686000	In this studio, but they're afraid of people
1686000	1688000	They like to run and hide
1688000	1690000	So they're currently probably under my bed
1690000	1692000	Maruko loves me
1692000	1694000	Yeah, but they don't know Loki
1694000	1696000	And so they're probably like, who's that guy
1696000	1698000	Maruko was sitting next to me, cuddling
1698000	1700000	While I was reading
1700000	1702000	He walks around with his tail in the air, showing off his butt
1702000	1704000	Look at my butt
1704000	1706000	And
1706000	1708000	I was getting the occasional stink eye
1708000	1710000	From Sanrio
1710000	1712000	Yeah, mostly, and I was reading those books here
1712000	1714000	By the way, reading them here
1714000	1716000	And looking at your video games, seeing which ones I was gonna run off with
1716000	1718000	Not really
1718000	1720000	I was out of town, by the way, Disneyland
1720000	1722000	Mostly, it's just been
1722000	1724000	That we've still been arranging a lot of stuff from the move
1724000	1726000	So we haven't had
1726000	1728000	A significant amount of time
1728000	1730000	Also, the issues with my hand are getting worse again
1730000	1732000	So I can't really sit down
1732000	1734000	And play for very long
1734000	1736000	Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?
1736000	1738000	Well
1738000	1740000	This week I didn't really play much
1740000	1742000	Because I play Call of Duty at work
1742000	1744000	Which is fine
1744000	1746000	Like I said, my coworkers are trying
1746000	1748000	Multiple ways to get me to
1748000	1750000	Not be as good
1750000	1752000	Including, as of Friday
1752000	1754000	They taped a piece of cardboard
1754000	1756000	To my monitor with a few random holes poked in it
1756000	1758000	And of course, you know
1758000	1760000	Blocking about 90% of the monitor
1760000	1762000	I still managed to stealth kill
1762000	1764000	A few people with a knife doing that
1764000	1766000	But yeah, I could not aim and shoot
1766000	1768000	At anybody because there was nothing in the direct center
1768000	1770000	So it made it very difficult to
1770000	1772000	Try to actually shoot somebody
1772000	1774000	Um
1774000	1776000	And then, um
1776000	1778000	Let's see what else
1778000	1780000	Oh, and I played Skyrim
1780000	1782000	Earlier in the week
1782000	1784000	But I, you know, stopped
1784000	1786000	Playing it this week just so I could get some
1786000	1788000	Other stuff done because every time I'm like
1788000	1790000	Well, I could work on this, or I could play Skyrim
1790000	1792000	I want to play Skyrim
1792000	1794000	And
1794000	1796000	I started going through
1796000	1798000	Some of the Thief Guild stuff
1798000	1800000	I started a
1800000	1802000	Quest in Winterhold
1802000	1804000	And
1804000	1806000	It crashed
1806000	1808000	Well, the quest crashed because
1808000	1810000	Apparently if you do something out of order in that
1810000	1812000	Quest, it breaks
1812000	1814000	You know, something that would be very obvious
1814000	1816000	To anybody that tested the game
1816000	1818000	But I don't think anybody tested the game
1818000	1820000	Or there's too damn much to test
1820000	1822000	That's also probably part of the problem
1822000	1824000	There's too much damn stuff to test
1824000	1826000	But you would think that the first things they would test
1826000	1828000	Would be, I don't know, the quest from the game
1828000	1830000	I mean, obviously
1830000	1832000	They can't test
1832000	1834000	If you step on this rock over here
1834000	1836000	And you get launched into space
1836000	1838000	Or something like that, because there's a lot of
1838000	1840000	Landmass to go wander around and test
1840000	1842000	Every single random event that would happen
1842000	1844000	But I would think an actual quest
1844000	1846000	In the game
1846000	1848000	Um, it would be very obvious
1848000	1850000	That it's not working correctly
1850000	1852000	But I don't care
1852000	1854000	I don't have to finish that quest
1854000	1856000	I'm not a necessarily completionist in this case
1856000	1858000	But it's just still annoying though
1858000	1860000	That something like that would break
1860000	1862000	I mean, I don't mind if like
1862000	1864000	You know, a
1864000	1866000	A character gets trapped in a wall or something like that
1866000	1868000	Okay, I did mind that a little bit
1868000	1870000	And I had to reload a few times, but
1870000	1872000	It's just, it's getting to the point now
1872000	1874000	Where I'm actually starting to get the
1874000	1876000	Frame stutters and stuff like that
1876000	1878000	Like, it's stopping
1878000	1880000	Going, stopping, and going
1880000	1882000	And I have to stop moving for a second
1882000	1884000	For it to catch up
1884000	1886000	That's not good, that's the PS3 crap
1886000	1888000	That, you know, is going on right now
1888000	1890000	I think I might try to get back into some Skyrim this week
1890000	1892000	We'll see, because I've kind of, I'm a little
1892000	1894000	MMO'd out right now
1894000	1896000	But I'll get to my own week in a minute
1896000	1898000	Yes we do
1898000	1900000	That would make WoW more interesting
1900000	1902000	And I'm not really sure if we want to talk about it right now
1902000	1904000	But I've also, like I told you
1904000	1906000	That I've been, my coworkers
1906000	1908000	Have been finding ways to try to
1908000	1910000	Hinder my gameplay in Call of Duty
1910000	1912000	Let me set this up a little bit
1912000	1914000	Because this is one of the stories we didn't talk about
1914000	1916000	A lot last week, because it seemed like it was everywhere
1916000	1918000	And it's not really a story
1918000	1920000	It was really something that caught
1920000	1922000	Fire in a non-news
1922000	1924000	Week, I mean, yes, the
1924000	1926000	Guy was an idiot, but it was just
1926000	1928000	That guy got taken to the cleaners
1928000	1930000	It was just like, really? This is how bored
1930000	1932000	We are, but it's
1932000	1934000	Obviously we're talking about the ocean marketing thing
1934000	1936000	And the whole controller that they were promoting
1936000	1938000	Was the Avenger
1938000	1940000	Now, I think we can all separate the controller
1940000	1942000	From the situation
1942000	1944000	And this one guy with the ego
1944000	1946000	However, ironically enough
1946000	1948000	Loki had procured a copy
1948000	1950000	Of this controller
1950000	1952000	We've had one of these for months now
1952000	1954000	And was ready to review it on the show
1954000	1956000	When this all happened
1956000	1958000	So, Loki, go ahead, the Avenger controller now
1958000	1960000	Okay, the Avenger controller
1960000	1962000	It's basically, I mean
1962000	1964000	Different spins I've heard on it
1964000	1966000	One, yes, it's created by a guy
1966000	1968000	I think he was a teacher or something like that
1968000	1970000	And his reasoning behind it
1970000	1972000	Was, oh, I wanted to make
1972000	1974000	Something that made games a little bit
1974000	1976000	More accessible for
1976000	1978000	People with disabilities or something like that
1978000	1980000	Because he knew somebody that had trouble
1980000	1982000	With a range of motion or something like that
1982000	1984000	So they had
1984000	1986000	Issues reaching
1986000	1988000	The buttons or something
1988000	1990000	I don't know what the case may be
1990000	1992000	But that said, though, the way they're
1992000	1994000	Marketing it is not necessarily
1994000	1996000	You know, oh, this is for people
1996000	1998000	That have disabilities
1998000	2000000	Or, oh, yeah, and if you have disabilities
2000000	2002000	That would be good, too, but no
2002000	2004000	It's supposed to be something that actually
2004000	2006000	Decreases the amount of
2006000	2008000	Latency
2008000	2010000	Between your reaction
2010000	2012000	And hitting the buttons
2012000	2014000	And the way they do that is by putting these
2014000	2016000	Extra arms above
2016000	2018000	The
2018000	2020000	X, Y, and
2020000	2022000	B buttons
2022000	2024000	These arms reach out over
2024000	2026000	Behind the trigger and kind of
2026000	2028000	On the middle of your finger
2028000	2030000	For the B button as well
2030000	2032000	Am I doing this right? I'm holding this right now
2032000	2034000	You kind of lift up?
2034000	2036000	Yeah, you're supposed to lift up and it's supposed to hit the button
2036000	2038000	It's a little interesting
2038000	2040000	You can adjust those arms, too
2040000	2042000	Because that's adjusted for me right now
2042000	2044000	You're supposed to hit up
2044000	2046000	And then for the triggers now
2046000	2048000	You can see on the triggers
2048000	2050000	There's a rubber band thing that goes underneath the bottom
2050000	2052000	You're supposed to pull up on the bottom
2052000	2054000	With your finger to pull the trigger
2054000	2056000	Because the way they have it
2056000	2058000	It's tightened to the point now where
2058000	2060000	It's just to the point where
2060000	2062000	It's going to trigger the actual
2062000	2064000	Button
2064000	2066000	On the actual trigger
2066000	2068000	That's supposed to cut down
2068000	2070000	The amount of time it takes you
2070000	2072000	To
2072000	2074000	Press the trigger buttons
2074000	2076000	It doesn't make you better in games
2076000	2078000	Because you're hitting buttons faster
2078000	2080000	And your reaction time is faster
2080000	2082000	That's all good on paper
2082000	2084000	But it doesn't work that way, unfortunately
2084000	2086000	Because you have to retrain yourself
2086000	2088000	To play games
2088000	2090000	And it's actually very fucking awkward
2090000	2092000	To play with that
2092000	2094000	It was harder to play Call of Duty
2094000	2096000	And I gave it
2096000	2098000	I think I gave it a fair amount of time
2098000	2100000	I'd say a total of about
2100000	2102000	About five hours worth of gameplay
2102000	2104000	That I played during lunches
2104000	2106000	On Call of Duty with that
2106000	2108000	I played during our
2108000	2110000	Morning and afternoon
2110000	2112000	And deathmatch games and stuff like that
2112000	2114000	And I still was alright
2114000	2116000	But it was just a hassle
2116000	2118000	Especially trying to trigger certain buttons
2118000	2120000	And I don't really
2120000	2122000	I mean, Call of Duty
2122000	2124000	I don't think a lot of people really need to hit
2124000	2126000	The face buttons fast
2126000	2128000	Because it's like, reload
2128000	2130000	Yeah, okay, reload
2130000	2132000	Or like switching weapons or crouching
2132000	2134000	You don't really need that
2134000	2136000	I'm really curious, though, about the
2136000	2138000	So obviously you just find it awkward
2138000	2140000	And I gotta admit, when I'm holding it
2140000	2142000	I don't really play shooters, though
2142000	2144000	For me, this would not be an advantage
2144000	2146000	But accessibility is a big thing
2146000	2148000	About this dark soccer
2148000	2150000	I'm really curious what you think
2150000	2152000	Having your hand issues
2152000	2154000	It's really my first two fingers
2154000	2156000	And the things that
2156000	2158000	I really don't like all this crap on top of it
2158000	2160000	But I like the two extensions
2160000	2162000	On the triggers
2162000	2164000	And you see how there's a rubber bandy thing?
2164000	2166000	You can also tug on that
2166000	2168000	And that triggers it, too
2168000	2170000	But this actually is much more comfortable
2170000	2172000	To my finger because I don't have to
2172000	2174000	Have it up and put my hand in an awkward position
2174000	2176000	The whole problem I have with the triggers
2176000	2178000	Is that
2178000	2180000	I have to move my hand
2180000	2182000	Much higher up to reach them
2182000	2184000	And if I had something that
2184000	2186000	Would work for
2186000	2188000	The top two triggers instead of the back one
2188000	2190000	Like this long piece
2190000	2192000	It would be very comfortable for me
2192000	2194000	So like a half Avenger would be really good
2194000	2196000	For dark soccer?
2196000	2198000	Well, unfortunately, the part that you can take off the Avenger
2198000	2200000	Are the actual trigger buttons
2200000	2202000	I don't know what they call them, paddles
2202000	2204000	Or whatever the hell on the back there
2204000	2206000	Those are the things you can take off
2206000	2208000	If you don't like
2208000	2210000	Pulling on the actual skis
2210000	2212000	Or whatever the hell that's called
2212000	2214000	Derek H. in our chatroom at chat.orangesonshade.com
2214000	2216000	Says, Loki should tape three of his fingers together
2216000	2218000	To simulate how it is supposed to be used
2220000	2222000	So
2222000	2224000	Honestly, it's a waste of money
2224000	2226000	To be honest
2226000	2228000	I think I want one
2228000	2230000	My opinion is it's a waste of money
2230000	2232000	See, it's very, very interesting
2232000	2234000	So like for you
2234000	2236000	The normal controller doesn't bug you
2236000	2238000	But for her, she's like
2238000	2240000	Okay, now I can see maybe something that might
2240000	2242000	Let me play games a little longer
2242000	2244000	You should just give her yours
2244000	2246000	But here's the thing though
2246000	2248000	Jamie, you're having trouble hitting some of the
2248000	2250000	These would need to be adjusted
2250000	2252000	Okay, but the buttons that you have trouble
2252000	2254000	Hitting are the shoulder buttons, right?
2254000	2255000	Yeah
2255000	2257000	Okay, well they have controllers that have
2257000	2259000	Remappable buttons that would be on the bottom
2259000	2261000	Of the controller that you would hit with
2261000	2263000	One of your middle fingers
2263000	2265000	You drop Siri
2265000	2267000	On the
2267000	2269000	On this controller
2269000	2271000	It's just the problem is
2271000	2273000	$50 first off
2273000	2275000	For not a controller
2275000	2277000	They call it a controller, it's not a fucking controller
2277000	2279000	It's a piece of shit that attaches to a controller
2279000	2281000	If it were a controller, I would be able to take this off
2281000	2283000	And play with just this
2283000	2285000	And it would work just fine
2285000	2287000	$50 for that's a little steep
2287000	2289000	I mean, and really
2289000	2291000	I understand that there could be uses for it
2291000	2293000	As far as
2293000	2295000	People
2295000	2297000	Like they said right here
2297000	2299000	The rocker
2299000	2301000	They said players with larger or smaller hands
2301000	2303000	May utilize the rocker for added
2303000	2305000	Comfort
2305000	2307000	With smaller or larger hands
2307000	2309000	What's it meant for? I mean, I don't understand
2309000	2311000	Comes equipped with an
2311000	2314000	Optional stabilizing stand
2314000	2316000	Tension straps and trigger skis
2316000	2318000	These are called trigger skis apparently
2318000	2320000	And they suck, they do not work
2320000	2322000	I've tried pulling the trigger using this
2322000	2324000	It does not work, I mean
2324000	2326000	Really what would make the controller
2326000	2328000	In general better for me
2328000	2330000	Is just to extend the top to where the two triggers
2330000	2332000	Are further back
2332000	2334000	They have also these
2334000	2336000	Sticker things that I pulled off of here already
2336000	2338000	Because I'm planning on reselling this
2338000	2340000	Because it's a piece of shit
2340000	2342000	They had one that plucked
2342000	2344000	And that's the other thing too
2344000	2346000	You'll notice that there's actually the triggers for all the buttons
2346000	2348000	Except for the A button
2348000	2350000	You still have to move your thumb off of here
2350000	2352000	To push jump
2352000	2354000	And it's recessed because now there's this hunk of garbage
2354000	2356000	On top of the controller
2356000	2358000	To hit the A button
2358000	2360000	So their solution is there's a sticky pad
2360000	2362000	That you can put on top of there
2362000	2364000	So not worth the price at all
2364000	2366000	It's not worth the price
2366000	2368000	But maybe an accessibility thing
2368000	2370000	Maybe if you have issues
2370000	2372000	You might want to try one
2372000	2374000	Honestly I think it could be done better
2374000	2376000	If it's an accessibility thing I think it could be done better
2376000	2378000	And if you're having trouble hitting
2378000	2380000	If you want something that's gonna hit these
2380000	2382000	Face buttons or whatever
2382000	2384000	I'd recommend if you're playing Call of Duty
2384000	2386000	They had one either for Modern Warfare 2
2386000	2388000	Or Black Ops
2388000	2390000	They had a controller with two
2390000	2392000	It was from Mad Catz with two buttons on the bottom
2392000	2394000	That were mappable to either the
2394000	2396000	Left stick, right stick, or L3, R3
2396000	2398000	And then the four face buttons
2398000	2400000	And you can hit those buttons
2400000	2402000	On the bottom
2402000	2404000	Using, I guess it would be
2404000	2406000	Let me see here
2406000	2408000	It would be probably with your middle finger
2408000	2410000	To hit those buttons on the bottom
2410000	2412000	And that's actually not too bad
2412000	2414000	Because the comfort goes
2414000	2416000	So that would be my recommendation
2416000	2418000	And that, for 50 bucks, you actually get a controller
2418000	2420000	That you can use straight out of the box and go
2420000	2422000	This is $50
2422000	2424000	Plus you have to have a $60
2424000	2426000	Controller to plug it on top of
2426000	2428000	So it's $110
2428000	2430000	And I love their website
2430000	2432000	And this is another reason for me to hate G4
2432000	2434000	But I love their website
2434000	2436000	Because they have a bunch of different
2436000	2438000	Reviews on it
2438000	2440000	And one of them was from G4
2440000	2442000	This and the controller from Evil Controllers
2442000	2444000	Which is ironic because this controller
2444000	2446000	I have in here is a modded controller
2446000	2448000	From Evil Controllers
2448000	2450000	Yes, and they're fucking expensive
2450000	2452000	So I don't recommend buying them because it's not
2452000	2454000	You can get it way cheaper and stuff
2454000	2456000	But they're still nice
2456000	2458000	They're like
2458000	2460000	Their review
2460000	2462000	And this is Adam Sessler on fucking X-Play
2462000	2464000	Their review was
2464000	2466000	We don't like the Evil Controllers because
2466000	2468000	The rapid fire controller is cheating
2468000	2470000	Well if you guys like cheating then
2470000	2472000	That was their negative
2472000	2474000	Review for Evil Controllers
2474000	2476000	But we like this Avenger one because it's not cheating
2476000	2478000	That was the reason they liked it
2478000	2480000	So there's
2480000	2482000	Your educated
2482000	2484000	Review for that
2484000	2486000	Interesting side though, did you hear
2486000	2488000	G4 has a new president now
2488000	2490000	It has to do with the whole Comcast
2490000	2492000	G4 is a Comcast network and the whole
2492000	2494000	Comcast NBC thing that's happening
2494000	2496000	Interesting
2496000	2498000	Because
2498000	2500000	They were trying to pull
2500000	2502000	With a lot of the stuff
2502000	2504000	Well you know
2504000	2506000	The Avenger was
2506000	2508000	It was meant for people with
2508000	2510000	Disabilities and stuff and they tried to swing
2510000	2512000	That whole emotional like
2512000	2514000	I've got to feel sorry for them and stuff
2514000	2516000	They donated a child's play and stuff
2516000	2518000	Because of this whole bad PR and the fact that
2518000	2520000	They still haven't delivered these pieces of shit controllers
2520000	2522000	Yeah I got one of these months ago so they were done
2522000	2524000	They just haven't manufactured them
2524000	2526000	I mean it's fucking plastic
2526000	2528000	So I don't know why it's taking so long
2528000	2530000	And that's
2530000	2532000	And that's the way that they were marketing it
2532000	2534000	Except the problem is
2534000	2536000	It's not Avenger
2536000	2538000	The controller to allow
2538000	2540000	All gamers to play games
2540000	2542000	Including those with disabilities
2542000	2544000	Avenger! The ultimate gaming advantage
2544000	2546000	And no I'm sorry it's not an advantage
2546000	2548000	It's actually quite a disadvantage and I seriously
2548000	2550000	I would recommend
2550000	2552000	You know what if you're going to spend a lot of money on controllers
2552000	2554000	Buy a professionally modded controller
2554000	2556000	Or you know those actual
2556000	2558000	The Mad Catz ones and they have the
2558000	2560000	Ones for the major league gamers
2560000	2562000	Or whatever that actually looked pretty cool
2562000	2564000	And so I'd pick up one of the nicer
2564000	2566000	Controllers instead of a $50 piece of crap
2566000	2568000	Alright
2568000	2570000	That's enough clearly we know how you feel
2570000	2572000	About that Loki so that's enough
2572000	2574000	Alright I gave it a fair share I mean
2574000	2576000	I played for that for five hours and trust me
2576000	2578000	I did not want to play for that
2578000	2580000	You know long a time with that controller
2580000	2582000	Which is terrible
2582000	2584000	Alright my gaming week quickly I don't have a lot to really add
2584000	2586000	Because there hasn't really been any new games to come out
2586000	2588000	So it's been basically more
2588000	2590000	Sweat Tour, Star Wars The Old Republic
2590000	2592000	And Warcraft of course
2592000	2594000	Because that's every week
2594000	2596000	Randomly got an urge to play Super Mario World
2596000	2598000	Am I weird?
2598000	2600000	I have a Super Nintendo sitting right there in a Mario World cart
2600000	2602000	Yet I've been playing it on the Wii
2602000	2604000	I've been playing on the Wii with the classic controller
2604000	2606000	And I've been doing that because you can
2606000	2608000	Remember in Mario World you can only save after you beat
2608000	2610000	Like a ghost house or a fortress
2610000	2612000	But thanks to Wii save states
2612000	2614000	Not really save states but you can just kind of hit the home button
2614000	2616000	Anywhere and it remembers right where you're at
2616000	2618000	So that's pretty cool
2618000	2620000	Yeah so I've been playing that just old school
2620000	2622000	A little bit and finally tried PVP
2622000	2624000	In Sweat Tour
2624000	2626000	And it was actually really fun I love the commentators
2626000	2628000	Oh my god that part was really funny
2628000	2630000	As you're playing there's actually live commentators
2630000	2632000	Like you know oh they just killed
2632000	2634000	A guy on the frog pants team
2634000	2636000	They took him down it was just really funny
2636000	2638000	Is Greg Proops in there again?
2638000	2640000	No it's not Greg Proops
2640000	2642000	Such a missed opportunity I mean he's not doing anything
2642000	2644000	The frog knobs or something
2644000	2646000	I don't know the teams have funny names
2646000	2648000	What's he doing now he's like hosting some like
2648000	2650000	Some weird news on Yahoo
2650000	2652000	Or something like that I mean come on
2652000	2654000	The guy's not doing anything right now
2654000	2656000	No no no he's got his podcast it's great
2656000	2658000	Smartest man in the world I would endorse that podcast
2658000	2660000	I have to say I listened to it in Rob's car
2660000	2662000	He can squeeze out some more voice work
2662000	2664000	For a game come on
2664000	2666000	Come on just throw some money his way he'd do it
2666000	2668000	Alright um
2668000	2670000	Let's see so that was really my gaming week
2670000	2672000	We've been going on a long time
2672000	2674000	We gotta get into housekeeping real real quick
2674000	2676000	Now I have to admit I'm changing my tone
2676000	2678000	Here a little bit because I was about to come on here
2678000	2680000	And really point the finger and shake it
2680000	2682000	At the listeners because we have not had a lot

2796000	2798000	Tonight's news Loki why don't you start
2798000	2800000	Us off alright let's talk a little
2800000	2802000	Bit about Atari
2802000	2804000	And some of their
2804000	2806000	I guess witch hunts
2806000	2808000	Over
2808000	2810000	Infringing
2810000	2812000	IOS games apparently they're going after
2812000	2814000	Everybody that has games that look like theirs
2814000	2816000	And whether that you know they're just
2816000	2818000	A blatant rip off of like say
2818000	2820000	Asteroids or Breakout or something like that
2820000	2822000	Or if it just happens to be you know
2822000	2824000	A tank game with vector tanks you know
2824000	2826000	In fact
2826000	2828000	One indie app creator
2828000	2830000	Black Powder Media
2830000	2832000	They have a game
2832000	2834000	That's been pulled
2834000	2836000	Off of the
2836000	2838000	App store because of
2838000	2840000	Claims from Atari of
2840000	2842000	Copyright infringement of course their game
2842000	2844000	Is very similar I guess it looks
2844000	2846000	Similar to Battlezone
2846000	2848000	Vector tanks is the game
2848000	2850000	And apparently
2850000	2852000	They're going after everybody
2852000	2854000	And you know Atari
2854000	2856000	You know release the same instance
2856000	2858000	For companies like Atari our intellectual property
2858000	2860000	Portfolio is our
2860000	2862000	Most valued asset
2862000	2864000	While we have a great respect for any
2864000	2866000	Development community and greatly appreciate
2866000	2868000	The enthusiasm that they have for
2868000	2870000	Our renowned properties we need to vigorously
2870000	2872000	Protect our intellectual property
2872000	2874000	And ensure that it's represented
2874000	2876000	In a highly innovative
2876000	2878000	Represent highly innovative
2878000	2880000	Games okay well I gotta stop I'm right there
2880000	2882000	Highly innovative games I'm sorry
2882000	2884000	Your remake of centipede
2884000	2886000	What is it the last the one that came out
2886000	2888000	In the fall
2888000	2890000	Last year it's terrible
2890000	2892000	And not innovative in the least and
2892000	2894000	What test drive Ferrari
2894000	2896000	That's innovative to the you know test
2896000	2898000	Drive franchise I'm sorry
2898000	2900000	That's not true this is a
2900000	2902000	Slippery slope though because like I
2902000	2904000	I want to say okay yeah I
2904000	2906000	Get it we see these knockoff games
2906000	2908000	On the iOS devices and especially
2908000	2910000	Android stuff all the time but
2910000	2912000	Where do you draw the line because if you think
2912000	2914000	About it couldn't any
2914000	2916000	Shoot them up game any
2916000	2918000	First person shooter couldn't anything
2918000	2920000	Come back to combat
2920000	2922000	If you really think about it
2922000	2924000	Well like see I have a problem with
2924000	2926000	The fact that you know okay it's a vector
2926000	2928000	Game that has tanks in it I'm sorry
2928000	2930000	But even I think in the arcades they had
2930000	2932000	More than just battle zone I remember
2932000	2934000	I remember an awesome
2934000	2936000	PC game awesome awesome PC
2936000	2938000	Game called specter that was
2938000	2940000	Like a vector tank game but it was
2940000	2942000	It was not I mean
2942000	2944000	It was not battle zone like
2944000	2946000	It was a step I remember the big thing about it
2946000	2948000	Is you could do modem play and all this stuff which was huge
2948000	2950000	You know when I was growing up and the whole reason
2950000	2952000	They're doing this of course is because
2952000	2954000	Because they have their own games that they're
2954000	2956000	Releasing on the iOS marketplace
2956000	2958000	And that's what it really comes down to I think
2958000	2960000	Is that they just want to release it and
2960000	2962000	Actually get some money for it but
2962000	2964000	I mean let's be
2964000	2966000	Serious here you know like Arkanoid
2966000	2968000	And stuff like that I mean which Arkanoid isn't really
2968000	2970000	There's actually was it Breakout
2970000	2972000	Taito was
2972000	2974000	But Breakout I mean that's
2974000	2976000	Pretty much like Arkanoid
2976000	2978000	Well Arkanoid is just a souped up
2978000	2980000	Version of Breakout if you will
2980000	2982000	It's got the falling things that you pick up
2982000	2984000	That change the paddle
2984000	2986000	I would say that that's more of like a genre
2986000	2988000	Of games now less
2988000	2990000	Of a you know because
2990000	2992000	It kind of goes back to saying well
2992000	2994000	You know there's fighting games
2994000	2996000	And they're all clones of Street Fighter
2996000	2998000	Well it's a genre now
2998000	3000000	It's not necessarily yeah a lot of
3000000	3002000	Stuff you know is inspired by
3002000	3004000	Or is a clone of something and then they
3004000	3006000	Kind of throw their own unique spin on it and there's
3006000	3008000	That or there's the
3008000	3010000	Games that are on the iOS a lot
3010000	3012000	Of games out there that there's guys
3012000	3014000	Trying to make a quick buck and they put some with the Angry Birds
3014000	3016000	Characters they literally rip the assets
3016000	3018000	From the game and then they create something else
3018000	3020000	Or you know something that's like it's
3020000	3022000	Angry cats and then there's dogs or something
3022000	3024000	Or you just you know to the point where
3024000	3026000	That's a rip off don't the masses
3026000	3028000	Kind of know how to tell a cheap rip
3028000	3030000	Off though well the masses do but see
3030000	3032000	It reminds me of those
3032000	3034000	CDs they sell at Target for like
3034000	3036000	$5 that are like you know
3036000	3038000	Top 40 hits and all it is it's like
3038000	3040000	Really bad cover songs
3040000	3042000	Of the stuff that's on the radio right now
3042000	3044000	But like a lot of it
3044000	3046000	Though it's kind of like
3046000	3048000	One of those things you they have to try to
3048000	3050000	Protect their rights or they lose their rights
3050000	3052000	You know it so they kind
3052000	3054000	Of have to do this but at the same time
3054000	3056000	I think the reason they're doing this is because they're putting games
3056000	3058000	Up on the iOS you know platform
3058000	3060000	That you know
3060000	3062000	I mean they recently released updated
3062000	3064000	Versions of Breakout and Asteroids
3064000	3066000	So I mean maybe that's why
3066000	3068000	They're doing it but
3068000	3070000	I mean okay
3070000	3072000	I can't fault them for trying to do that
3072000	3074000	And let's be honest there's a lot of shit
3074000	3076000	On the app store that's
3076000	3078000	Fucking just ripping off
3078000	3080000	All sorts of shit I mean there's a ton
3080000	3082000	Of rip off games out there
3082000	3084000	And there's a ton of games inspired by
3084000	3086000	Stuff like I would say Vector Tanks
3086000	3088000	Is probably
3088000	3090000	Somewhat you know
3090000	3092000	Original game I mean yeah
3092000	3094000	It's inspired by the old vector graphics
3094000	3096000	And maybe inspired by Battlezone but it's not
3096000	3098000	Like they're not calling it Tank Zone
3098000	3100000	And you know it has you know basically
3100000	3102000	All the same gameplay as Battlezone
3102000	3104000	I just
3104000	3106000	I don't know I think that
3106000	3108000	They should be going out through the right people but they're
3108000	3110000	Going out through everybody instead
3110000	3112000	And at the same time why aren't the people there
3112000	3114000	Making the Mario games and shit like that
3114000	3116000	You know getting that stuff taken down
3116000	3118000	To turn this a 180
3118000	3120000	A little bit this is what really worries
3120000	3122000	Me about SOPA and that whole thing
3122000	3124000	And why you know people are really scared
3124000	3126000	Because if you allow corporations
3126000	3128000	To kind of draw the line they're gonna draw
3128000	3130000	It too far in the sand one way
3130000	3132000	Oh they're gonna take out everything
3132000	3134000	It's gonna be crazy
3134000	3136000	If something like that actually passes
3136000	3138000	You know I mean and all this
3138000	3140000	Stuff that we see is just evidence of that
3140000	3142000	Because Atari may overreach
3142000	3144000	In trying to protect
3144000	3146000	Their stuff and who's to say
3146000	3148000	You know other companies do you trust
3148000	3150000	A lot of these companies to draw the line
3150000	3152000	Of course and here's
3152000	3154000	A funny thing too like say for example
3154000	3156000	I make a game or something that's pretty
3156000	3158000	Original and I release it out there
3158000	3160000	And Atari goes
3160000	3162000	And I consider ripping
3162000	3164000	Off some of my ideas
3164000	3166000	Or something like that and that's not necessarily because they do that
3166000	3168000	This game is too much like Custer's Revenge
3168000	3170000	That Loki made and so
3170000	3172000	We have the rights to this game
3172000	3174000	Even though it was really a third party
3174000	3176000	Let's say for example
3176000	3178000	Here's an example that's not necessarily accurate
3178000	3180000	But
3180000	3182000	Was it the ferret tossing game
3182000	3184000	Let's just say the ferret tossing game comes out
3184000	3186000	And it's too much like
3186000	3188000	Defender with the whole
3188000	3190000	Scrolling left and right
3190000	3192000	Too much like Defender or okay
3192000	3194000	That's a bad example let's just say
3194000	3196000	Say I release the game out there
3196000	3198000	And all of a sudden you know Atari comes out
3198000	3200000	Or not even necessarily Atari just some company
3200000	3202000	Comes out and you know a major
3202000	3204000	Company and puts out a game
3204000	3206000	On iOS or something like that it's very
3206000	3208000	Similar to my game like as far as all the
3208000	3210000	Original aspects of that game it's very
3210000	3212000	Similar to that I myself
3212000	3214000	Go to Apple and say hey I want
3214000	3216000	You to take this down are they gonna
3216000	3218000	Do it probably not because this
3218000	3220000	Major company that you know has a
3220000	3222000	Lot more money invested into the app
3222000	3224000	Store than I do and they're just probably gonna
3224000	3226000	Ignore what I say yet if
3226000	3228000	Apple comes and says hey we don't like
3228000	3230000	Ferret tossing or whatever like that
3230000	3232000	Even though it
3232000	3234000	Vaguely resembles something that they may have done
3234000	3236000	They will take it down without
3236000	3238000	Who's gonna know where to draw the line
3238000	3240000	Nobody is that
3240000	3242000	Do you trust the government to draw the line
3242000	3244000	Do you think senators
3244000	3246000	And all them play video games
3246000	3248000	I think one senator came out and said
3248000	3250000	Well a lot of my staff does play Mortal Combat
3250000	3252000	Like that was the most
3252000	3254000	Video game keen thing I've ever heard
3254000	3256000	No it was a
3256000	3258000	Justice it was that
3258000	3260000	Court case about the
3260000	3262000	ESA versus
3262000	3264000	The California law and all that that's where that
3264000	3266000	Came out well I think you know to be honest I have
3266000	3268000	A problem with you know if a lot of the
3268000	3270000	People in government that
3270000	3272000	They don't play games I mean honestly
3272000	3274000	That's
3274000	3276000	I understand that not everybody
3276000	3278000	Plays games out there but I would
3278000	3280000	I would assume nowadays that the vast majority
3280000	3282000	Of the populace plays games in some
3282000	3284000	Form or another not necessarily console
3284000	3286000	Games but at least on the internet you know the
3286000	3288000	Occasional
3288000	3290000	Phone game or something like that
3290000	3292000	And if these people representing us
3292000	3294000	Don't have any fucking clue about
3294000	3296000	What's going on out there
3296000	3298000	They just don't care they'd be like well I don't
3298000	3300000	Watch TV so why should I protect the rights of the
3300000	3302000	People that want to watch TV I mean
3302000	3304000	That's just not good
3304000	3306000	We need to get these people out
3306000	3308000	Anyhow tangent sorry about that but it's
3308000	3310000	Important it's kind of stuff that's going on
3310000	3312000	Right now anyhow
3312000	3314000	Kind of going in a completely different direction here
3314000	3316000	We mentioned earlier in the show that it
3316000	3318000	Is kind of a slow release period there's not a lot
3318000	3320000	Of games coming out until closer to the end of the month
3320000	3322000	Of course you know Final Fantasy 13 2
3322000	3324000	It's slow release like B12
3324000	3326000	Yes but one game
3326000	3328000	If a certain Best Buy store
3328000	3330000	Is to be believed might just come out of nowhere
3330000	3332000	And steal the spotlight for this first quarter and that's
3332000	3334000	Diablo 3 according
3334000	3336000	To Best Buy
3336000	3338000	And this is again to be fair
3338000	3340000	It's not the whole damn corporation it's one store
3340000	3342000	That apparently was in Minnesota
3342000	3344000	Where the Twitter user was
3344000	3346000	That had a standee that said Diablo 3
3346000	3348000	Midnight opening available for
3348000	3350000	Purchase 1201 AM on February
3350000	3352000	1st as the launch day and
3352000	3354000	February by the way was spelled wrong
3354000	3356000	Well there's been this whole
3356000	3358000	Was it missing an R? There's this whole back
3358000	3360000	F-E-B-U-R
3360000	3362000	Instead of R-U
3362000	3364000	February yeah which granted
3364000	3366000	February's a tricky word is probably one of the more
3366000	3368000	Common misspelled words but still
3368000	3370000	Clearly not an official Blizzard
3370000	3372000	Product if that's the case
3372000	3374000	Now there was this whole back and forth that went on
3374000	3376000	A UK retailer
3376000	3378000	Kind of clarified the date too
3378000	3380000	And showed a February 3rd date
3380000	3382000	And then there was this whole
3382000	3384000	Other back and forth where the Best Buy
3384000	3386000	Was actually called by the gaming
3386000	3388000	Press and that the sign was
3388000	3390000	Actually taken down and then
3390000	3392000	Bashyok one of the community
3392000	3394000	Managers over at Blizzard actually said on
3394000	3396000	Twitter lol
3396000	3398000	We can't stop shops from doing whatever they want
3398000	3400000	To do I'm paraphrasing here
3400000	3402000	But retailers will find out when the rest of you do
3402000	3404000	Basically when it's in an official
3404000	3406000	Press release but certainly there's a lot of back
3406000	3408000	And forth going on about the release date
3408000	3410000	Loki you're on the inside a little bit
3410000	3412000	You're shaking your head over there and then there's
3412000	3414000	Micah Whipple
3414000	3416000	That's Bashyok
3416000	3418000	No they have not announced an official date yet
3418000	3420000	You'll know when they do
3420000	3422000	And I said this on Hoard House
3422000	3424000	I truly think
3424000	3426000	First off if they're going to street date something it's going to be on a Tuesday
3426000	3428000	And not a Wednesday
3428000	3430000	It's going to be March 27th
3430000	3432000	The very last day of the quarter that they could do it
3432000	3434000	I said
3434000	3436000	I firmly believe that
3436000	3438000	Because at this point with all the auction house back and forth that's been going on
3438000	3440000	And that beta is still going
3440000	3442000	They're going to want plenty of time for people
3442000	3444000	To be able to pre-order
3444000	3446000	Get those in and it's going to be carefully
3446000	3448000	Timed with the Blizzard blood pact
3448000	3450000	For Warcraft and the fact that
3450000	3452000	You're going to have these
3452000	3454000	Probably a million people getting it for free
3454000	3456000	Because they're committed to WoW
3456000	3458000	And they're going to drop it at a time where
3458000	3460000	It's going to distract them from WoW
3460000	3462000	Because nothing is going on in WoW
3462000	3464000	So I think end of March is reasonable
3464000	3466000	And they're also going to be starting
3466000	3468000	Their marketing campaign which will be massive
3468000	3470000	And so
3470000	3472000	One month lead time is not enough
3472000	3474000	So you will be
3474000	3476000	You'll bet your ass that
3476000	3478000	And know about it way before it comes out
3478000	3480000	Guys, you know in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com
3480000	3482000	Says, why do we have
3482000	3484000	All this secret release date stuff?
3484000	3486000	Just tell people, it's silly
3486000	3488000	It's not secret, it's the fact that it's not done yet
3488000	3490000	It's, Diablo 3 is fucking done
3490000	3492000	It's fucking done and the problem is
3492000	3494000	It has to do with the whole, it's the auction house thing
3494000	3496000	That's getting tied up in Korea is part of it
3496000	3498000	And now they're using this as an excuse
3498000	3500000	To put more into the game
3500000	3502000	Which is yet to be revealed
3502000	3504000	But I think a lot of this is to
3504000	3506000	Make sure that legally that auction house thing
3506000	3508000	Gets clearance in all the countries
3508000	3510000	I honestly believe that, I think this game should have been out
3510000	3512000	Last year and I think they were going to announce it
3512000	3514000	At Blizzcon for a December release
3514000	3516000	And change their tune when Korea happened
3516000	3518000	So, we'll see
3518000	3520000	Virtual M in our chatroom says
3520000	3522000	The website does list it as February 1st
3522000	3524000	If you go to bestbuy.com
3524000	3526000	But placeholder dates are super common, right?
3526000	3528000	It's probably, if I remember correctly
3528000	3530000	The last update we got from them
3530000	3532000	Was Q1 2012
3532000	3534000	And that's kind of an
3534000	3536000	You just place a placeholder date
3536000	3538000	Usually, like, I used to put it on a weird date
3538000	3540000	Like a Saturday or something like that in our system
3540000	3542000	So that, you know, I know it's a placeholder date
3542000	3544000	But yeah, there's no date for it yet
3544000	3546000	In fact, from
3546000	3548000	Yeah, I'm
3548000	3550000	I'm 100% sure there's not an official date for it yet
3550000	3552000	Although I haven't gotten an update from Activision in a while
3552000	3554000	So probably next time I get it, you know
3554000	3556000	Well, rumors are it could
3556000	3558000	The release, the news of a release date
3558000	3560000	Could be coming out
3560000	3562000	Next week, as early as next week
3562000	3564000	But I think a lot of that's wishful thinking
3564000	3566000	On the community and how sometimes
3566000	3568000	That snowballs into, oh, this is news now
3568000	3570000	So, we'll see
3570000	3572000	Probably what it was is a store jumped a gun
3572000	3574000	And they built some, you know
3574000	3576000	POP for the store
3576000	3578000	And plus, if, and Virtual M says
3578000	3580000	The website lists it as this
3580000	3582000	That's actually, Virtual M probably just explained
3582000	3584000	Where the issue came from
3584000	3586000	Best Buy didn't get that date from
3586000	3588000	From Blizzard
3588000	3590000	They got it from themselves
3590000	3592000	Probably in their own system
3592000	3594000	And the store manager was like, oh, we gotta make sales for this
3594000	3596000	Let's get a sign made up
3596000	3598000	And we're gonna push more sales of this
3598000	3600000	And it's February 1st in our system right here
3600000	3602000	Props to them for being, you know
3602000	3604000	Way to take initiative, but at the same time
3604000	3606000	You need to spell
3606000	3608000	Alright
3608000	3610000	Let's move on to Dark Soccer
3610000	3612000	With some other gaming news
3612000	3614000	This is not a rumor
3614000	3616000	Not a rumor
3616000	3618000	It's about
3618000	3620000	Kaz Harai
3620000	3622000	Guess what? He's being promoted
3622000	3624000	To president of Sony
3624000	3626000	That was actually put up by Nikkei
3626000	3628000	By the Japanese Stock Exchange
3628000	3630000	He's going to be replacing
3630000	3632000	Howard Stringer
3632000	3634000	The theory is
3634000	3636000	By April
3636000	3638000	It should be going on, but they have to finish everything
3638000	3640000	Through a board meeting
3640000	3642000	And Stringer is staying on as
3642000	3644000	The chairman and CEO
3644000	3646000	Yeah, we get a lot more
3646000	3648000	Ridge Racer and
3648000	3650000	Giant Enemy Crafts
3650000	3652000	But man
3652000	3654000	Sony's kind of in
3654000	3656000	Relatively crappy shape
3656000	3658000	Well, first off
3658000	3660000	Let me play this and then we'll come back
3660000	3662000	In honor of Kaz Harai ascending to the throne
3662000	3664000	At the top of Sony
3664000	3666000	I think we have to play our very favorite clip
3666000	3668000	From 2006
3668000	3670000	Please welcome Kaz Harai
3670000	3672000	Ridge Racer
3672000	3674000	The essence of the PlayStation DNA
3674000	3676000	Is real change
3676000	3678000	And the consumers are ready
3678000	3680000	Genji 2
3680000	3682000	Is an Ashen game
3682000	3684000	Which is based on Japanese history
3684000	3686000	Ridge Racer
3686000	3688000	Being based on history
3688000	3690000	The stages of the game
3690000	3692000	Will also be based on famous battles
3692000	3694000	Which actually took place
3694000	3696000	In ancient Japan
3696000	3698000	So here's this giant enemy crab
3698000	3700000	Ridge Racer
3700000	3702000	And you
3702000	3704000	Attack its weak point
3704000	3706000	For massive damage
3706000	3708000	It's Ridge Racer
3708000	3710000	Ridge Racer
3710000	3712000	PlayStation 3 will retail for
3712000	3714000	$599
3714000	3716000	$599
3716000	3718000	$599
3718000	3720000	Giant Enemy Crab
3720000	3722000	$599
3722000	3724000	$599
3724000	3726000	It's Ridge Racer
3726000	3728000	Ridge Racer
3728000	3730000	Don't forget old. That's Makah45
3730000	3732000	On YouTube by the way
3732000	3734000	That has that clip up there
3734000	3736000	I gotta, I gotta put this out there though
3736000	3738000	There's actually a reason why
3738000	3740000	I play that clip
3740000	3742000	Because it does tie in all this
3742000	3744000	It's not on the show role tonight
3744000	3746000	But this story makes me think about
3746000	3748000	How there's all of those news about the Vita
3748000	3750000	Over in Japan
3750000	3752000	is exhibitionally not doing well
3752000	3754000	Like to the point, this was on Yahoo.News
3754000	3755000	Where I saw this, so we're
3755000	3756000	pretty, you know, mainstream site
3756000	3762960	they're saying the Vita is bombing because the PSP outsold it in Japan last
3762960	3766800	week so in other words that's pretty bad they sold more PSP's last week and they
3766800	3771040	have the sales numbers to back it up that doesn't bode well for the Vita
3771040	3777000	however look at that clip this is just history repeating itself all over again
3777000	3782800	isn't it well it's too expensive the games are you know well you know hit
3782800	3785440	miss I gotta well I gotta give them credit there is a lot of interesting
3785440	3788160	stuff and I think a lot of people are really turned off by the price right now
3788160	3792440	and in some ways I kind of see history repeating itself here I don't think I
3792440	3796480	would write off the Vita as a horrific failure yet I mean it hasn't launched
3796480	3800800	here in the US for one I don't know if it's gonna I think it'll sell more than
3800800	3806160	PSP's do in the same week but I yeah I there's nothing I but I think the 3ds
3806160	3811520	is gonna stare is nothing coming out for the PSP nothing I mean okay one game but
3811520	3818240	it's it's a visual novel if I can also point out something last fiscal quarter
3818240	3825480	Sony lost 1.6 billion yen which is about 20 million dollars or 13 million pounds
3825480	3830680	so I mean I but but in my age well you never know like the PlayStation 3
3830680	3834320	everybody gave it shit in the beginning everybody gave it shit but it's come a
3834320	3838200	long way and right now you know especially with everything we were
3838200	3843160	saying with Microsoft at the top of the show PlayStation 3 is it's a pretty good
3843160	3845680	system right now you know it really depends on the games you want the
3845680	3849000	exclusives and all that but it's it's a worthy competitor the Xbox 360 I don't
3849000	3852540	think anybody would have said that in 2006 and honestly I think we're like the
3852540	3856560	3ds and stuff I don't see them squeezing out a lot more power out of that system
3856560	3860040	then the stuff that's out right now I mean sure there's gonna be some games
3860040	3864040	that look pretty nice and can do a little bit more but if 3d is all they
3864040	3868160	got I mean if you don't like the 3d you got a DS I mean that's pretty much it
3868160	3872640	I'm not being a defenseless or a defensive or whatever or being a fanboy
3872640	3876560	but I am saying hold on a minute because you know although I will great yes that
3876560	3880880	looks very bad that the PSP was out selling the Vita but didn't I could be
3880880	3884920	wrong but didn't the same thing happen with 3ds at first where eventually a
3884920	3888120	couple months later the older DS was we're out selling the 3ds and now look
3888120	3891980	where the 3ds is yeah I mean all it took was a few powerhouse games and now that
3891980	3895200	nobody's joking about the 3ds everybody's like within a matter of months
3895200	3898880	everybody's like okay yeah 3ds here to stay I mean no happening no one's
3898880	3903440	arguing that the fact that the 3d the 3ds launch versus the Vita launch I
3903440	3907320	mean the launch games are way better on the Vita there's actually stuff that
3907320	3910960	people would like on there I'm probably not gonna get one at launch because it
3910960	3915960	is too damn expensive and honestly I I don't I don't play my 3ds enough I mean
3915960	3921280	fuck I've only played Super Mario 3d land once and I'm not gonna buy a new
3921280	3925600	system game guru in our chat room says well yeah 3ds stole Monster Hunter which
3925600	3929480	is what everyone bought the PSP for in Japan so you know that those few key
3929480	3934680	games can really sell a system I mean you cannot deny that Mario 3d land and
3934680	3939040	Mario Kart 7 is the reason why 3ds nobody's you know joking about it
3939040	3945480	anymore and Monster Hunter in Japan certainly mm-hmm you know so anyhow all
3945480	3952400	right so cause her I I mean it'll these things happen you know but don't buy
3952400	3956920	Ridge Racer do not buy Ridge Racer for the Vita if you're going to buy a game
3956920	3960440	for the Vita I seriously if you're trying to buy a cheap game if you're
3960440	3965000	looking to buy a cheap game from Namco by touch my katamari because that's 30
3965000	3969680	bucks and you get a full game versus 30 bucks and get three tracks and five cars
3969680	3973620	all my eyes and chat says but Sony doesn't have a system seller like Mario
3973620	3978120	or Mario Kart they do have uncharted which is pretty big deal over here they
3978120	3982680	have uncharted they have wiped out if you like wipe out they have well hot
3982680	3988140	shots golf actually did pretty well in Japan it's not right I won't wipe out on
3988140	3992440	the same level as Mario Kart I really wouldn't it's not at launch but well
3992440	3995320	they have Modination Racers that's a launch title but that on the same level
3995320	4000260	as Mario Kart I'm like Sony's big within our God of War uncharted well within a
4000260	4005960	month a little big planet that that'll be big yeah luminous for me and and
4005960	4010320	third-party games luminous I don't see as a launch sales well I haven't gotten
4010320	4014680	Ubisoft updates yet but I haven't seen any there to launch stuff but in third
4014680	4018020	party stuff I mean you've got ninja Ninja Gaiden Sigma I mean that's a
4018020	4024480	pretty hardcore game ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 blaze blue extent or blaze blue
4024480	4035280	continuum shift extent there's the MMA game from 505 supremacy MMA I know
4035280	4041400	there's a FIFA game and you know Ridge Racer touch my katamari which looks
4041400	4046080	pretty good there's a lot of good games it's it's not like where huh well let's
4046080	4052440	see there's Nintendogs and a submarine game oh and pilot wings steel diver all
4052440	4056040	right Rama in our chat says if Sony knocked the price of the Vita down to
4056040	4060160	$1.99 they wouldn't need a system seller per se that maybe losing a lot of money
4060160	4064080	yeah that's I guess that's true but don't isn't it common to lose money on
4064080	4067320	systems you make it back up with the games yes the Vita the Vita does have a
4067320	4071200	lot that's not just games that's another thing you know it does have strengths in
4071200	4076360	just like the PSP had the web browser had the mp3s people call into the show
4076360	4081360	on their PSPs I mean you know let's see ah my eyes agree is true if they knock
4081360	4085920	the price down to $1.99 I would buy it and Yuki follows it up with same so the
4085920	4090480	price is yeah they're not gonna lose $100 in every system I mean that's just
4090480	4094360	stupid I mean it's stupid but at the same time I think it's fucking retarded
4094360	4098680	that I've got to buy another memory card that doesn't come with the system I mean
4098680	4103960	help the original PSP I think came with a 32 megabyte memory card I agree that
4103960	4107440	if they wanted to get they would put a small memory card in yeah like I really
4107440	4112120	need to even half not even half a gig but like let's do a 1 gig card I mean
4112120	4116000	those things cannot be the price to manufacture that they're charging I
4116000	4118440	don't think they would be taking a big loss by throwing one in and I think
4118440	4121880	they were really sweet in the pot because I sir I kid you not every single
4121880	4125760	one of those games requires a memory card and so here's here's a fun
4125760	4130760	situation I go buy a Vita and they're sold out of memory cards fuck I can't
4130760	4135280	play anything all right we got to move on we're running long in part a let's
4135280	4139520	move on with some more news Loki it's just like a great plan right there I
4139520	4145280	guess what apparently there's some insiders that say that there's going to
4145280	4151520	be the new unveiling of a new Xbox and new PlayStation this e3 and they
4151520	4156040	apparently have it from a very very very very very very very very reliable source
4156040	4161800	and this is MCV reporting this as well that both of their these new consoles
4161800	4167840	boom will be making their debut at e3 I'm not surprised I'm not sure if
4167840	4170440	obviously though that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna be out
4170440	4174840	this year or even next year I mean it could be I could see him coming out
4174840	4180680	maybe fall next year I call bull on this story because I I would believe the Xbox
4180680	4185560	I I think it's about time for the Xbox to show off their next console but I
4185560	4190360	don't think PlayStation 4 I don't think we need it yet I feel like PlayStation
4190360	4194720	3 took so long to get to its prime I I almost kind of believed the whole 10
4194720	4198520	year cycle thing I think I think PlayStation 4 coming out this this soon
4198520	4204520	is showing it this year I don't know I I Rob I think it's it's a Vita they've
4204520	4207640	got to push the Vita they've got to push that through the holiday you don't
4207640	4211240	understand though Rob a 10-year cycle doesn't necessarily mean that boom after
4211240	4214560	10 years they would launch a new console it means that they launch a new console
4214560	4220920	and it overlaps for three years I just III in my gut you know just says they
4220920	4224600	either can't be the PlayStation 4 this early it's just too damn early for the
4224600	4229400	PlayStation 4 it's a reliable source so it's so reliable the stories in the
4229400	4237280	reliability I mean it's so reliable I want to get their quote because it was
4237280	4240400	it was hilarious
4240400	4246560	ah nope don't have the quote oh well there's one guy's like I can guarantee
4246560	4251440	it a hundred percent it's gonna be there you know it's gonna be there the Wii U
4251440	4256880	and my disappointment actually you know what I'd be interested easy with this
4256880	4261760	what's gonna happen next week during you know the whole cuz CES stuff CES is
4261760	4266240	never really gaming I mean well no it was gonna be there with the Wii U yeah
4266240	4270040	but they swear up and down it's just the same the exact same thing they showed at
4270040	4274160	e3 for people who weren't able to wait in that horrifically long line yeah and
4274160	4277600	I don't think they need to I mean CES really isn't a gaming show what the
4277600	4281480	biggest game news I can think of that ever came out of CES was the Microsoft
4281480	4286000	Game Room was a big thing that came out it and unfortunately Microsoft Game Room
4286000	4292080	didn't last which is such don't get me on that game room had so much freaking
4292080	4295800	potential and now it's like ruined it for everything else like I'm just I'm so
4295800	4300560	mad about game room because it could have been so much more awesome and
4300560	4307160	really should have been but anyway no I think I think the big things Windows 8
4307160	4311400	you know you'll see more stuff about PC and in bigger TVs and 3d TVs and all
4311400	4314600	that I don't I don't think it's a lot about gaming consoles you might see
4314600	4319320	little things especially from Microsoft and the 360 because they're really
4319320	4322840	trying to make the 360 this whole like centerpiece I think they're gonna be
4322840	4329000	showing off some new channels and if you want to take a total shot in the dark
4329000	4335080	maybe something akin to the one versus 100 thing getting out some type of some
4335080	4339280	type of entertainment channel how you dig into those channels because I've
4339280	4342440	stopped downloading them because I just don't give a shit about them anymore
4342440	4346560	they're they're kind of pointless I hate to say it the only one I could ever see
4346560	4350200	myself using is that maybe I would use I heart radio if I was hosting a party
4350200	4353440	because there are some decent stations on there with very few commercials some
4353440	4357600	of the HD simulcasts you know that play like dance music or comedy on loop it's
4357600	4362400	kind of like having the satellite radio that's the one that I'm kind of like I
4362400	4368600	could see myself using this but the rest not really I don't know it that whole I
4368600	4371680	don't like the new interface to be honest it's just oh yeah I hate the
4371680	4375340	interface but that doesn't mean I don't like the point of some of the channels
4375340	4378880	and the Netflix channel certainly although actually I I find it better on
4378880	4383320	my ps3 so I used to think now the other we have the technology where we could I
4383320	4389640	don't know select the interface we want thought maybe hmm I'll be nice we have
4389640	4395320	the technology we can select it all right well speaking of rumors there are
4395320	4398880	some rumors about the really good Fleetwood Mac album there are some
4398880	4401880	rumors about the Xbox lube because remember that's what we're calling it
4401880	4405800	now if you don't know why we're calling the new Xbox system the Xbox lube you
4405800	4408520	have to go back and listen to some old episodes but apparently the Xbox lube is
4408520	4414240	supposed to be this sounds really slick it's supposed to be a DVR as well okay
4414240	4417560	that makes it worthwhile this is according to some patents that are
4417560	4420700	floating around out there that apparently on December 27th the US
4420700	4424360	patent office gave Microsoft a patent for a device that would be a game
4424360	4429040	console and a DVR a digital video recorder application running alongside a
4429040	4432800	television client component allows users to record media content on the gaming
4432800	4436600	console the DVR application also integrates itself with the console menu
4436600	4439720	once integrated users can record media content while playing games
4439720	4443320	alternatively users can record content when the gaming console is turned off
4443320	4447280	the recorded content can include television programming gaming experience
4447280	4451880	whether local or online interesting music DVDs and so on when in the
4451880	4455600	recording state users can also switch between various other media modes whether
4455600	4459520	gaming television and so on I would rather I think this would be more
4459520	4462800	something that would be integrated into a television set or integrated into a
4462800	4467040	Cosep top box that would be from a cable provider here's my other thing I mean
4467040	4470920	although I could certainly see this being feasible for the next system why
4470920	4475840	does it have to be the next system isn't it feasible they could release a 360
4475840	4480600	that has a DVR built in they could do that but I mean I think that by saying
4480600	4485120	it's in their next thing that makes it a selling point true true I mean it is the
4485120	4489720	kind of the big a big thing but I that's the type of thing really how well did
4489720	4495360	HD player hypothetically let's say it was in the 360 that I could see coming
4495360	4500000	out of CES but here's I think dark soccer it's gonna be the next it's never
4500000	4504080	I'm telling you it's never gonna happen on its own it's gonna be something from
4504080	4508440	a cable provider because why are they the cable providers are hey we're
4508440	4511880	providing content to you and you're gonna offer a DVR so now we can't charge
4511880	4516600	people that fee the cost to rent the DVR system out you know and and they don't
4516600	4521320	have to buy our you know our higher tier programs to get a you know DVR you're
4521320	4524840	gonna pull this shit on us fuck that we want some of that money so that's not
4524840	4528440	gonna happen they're gonna put that shit out themselves and it's gonna be kind of
4528440	4533360	like hey you can get Comcast and you get a game player as well you know a Comcast
4533360	4536800	box and you get games and you can do all this stuff or it's gonna be integrated
4536800	4540720	into a TV you know something like that because I'm telling you they're not
4540720	4545200	gonna I mean I I would love it it'd be great you know if we could have a DVR
4545200	4549880	because then I can DVR shit without having to pay my cable writer to do it
4549880	4554640	but I just don't see that happening it's kind of a pipe dream I mean there's
4554640	4560680	Divix or not Divix there's TiVo but you know who fuck uses TiVo anymore yeah you
4560680	4564640	got some support in chat room Loki a lot of folks agree with you Derek H says
4564640	4567760	Loki is correct I think he's saying it about this I don't know because of the
4567760	4571240	delay there's like a minute delay but Rama in the chat says the console is a
4571240	4575600	DVR will cause a problem because cable providers will not support it you're
4575600	4581320	right there are cable providers in agreement with Xbox Comcast our local one
4581320	4584560	is supposed to come on board in early 2012 because if you think about that
4584560	4590320	will be shown at CES for sure like if I can if I can DVR like whatever I can DVR
4590320	4594960	X show or whatever you know it can do like let's just say I can set it up like
4594960	4598640	a TV you know like I can set it up okay I want to record season of this why would
4598640	4603240	I buy the content off of their service I mean because I already DVR did I mean
4603240	4606640	they're losing sales that way they're not gonna do that I mean come on they're
4606640	4610680	gonna lock that shit out and so it's gonna either come from them or it's
4610680	4615080	gonna cost something to you know do that yeah I'm I could see where it's gonna
4615080	4619000	cost Microsoft points to DVR stuff you know it well and I wouldn't say it's
4619000	4622240	necessarily in costume to do so maybe you need a membership or something I
4622240	4625360	don't even know if you need members it's got to come from the cable provider it's
4625360	4628920	it's seriously that's something that would be like okay because now they have
4628920	4631880	these partnerships with these cable companies and stuff where you can do all
4631880	4635560	this on the man crap it's got to be something that's coming from them like a
4635560	4639240	new set top box what if it just worked with over-the-air TV though I mean
4639240	4643360	remember you can hook an antenna to your TV and these magical channels and it
4643360	4648140	works fantastic I can tune in zero channel it depends on where you live in
4648140	4654760	your connection it's it's terrible I need like a big old retro in order well
4654760	4660520	no they don't look like that anymore now they're like square they're I mean
4660520	4665000	seriously I I tried to hooking one up to I was like yeah I'm gonna put this up
4665000	4670680	I'm gonna get on my HDTV for free it worked like crap I got nothing not even
4670680	4675320	a Spanish channel that came in correctly although when I was programming it
4675320	4679440	actually got worse every time I tried to find stations all right listen I
4679440	4683760	actually have to say to be perfectly honest I have no use for DVR I don't
4683760	4688040	watch TV Dan doesn't watch TV everything that we watch is streamed I was to say
4688040	4693280	BBC America maybe I Supernatural on CW I download my shows on the internet
4693280	4697920	because I hate commercials mm-hmm and besides that you know the commercials
4697920	4703640	are what provide your free television I don't watch the TV I mean Dan the only
4703640	4709840	shows that he watches is like Sons of Anarchy and Top Gear and guess what he
4709840	4714560	streams them from other places we were I mean we're paying for cable we rarely
4714560	4718200	use we'd actually downgraded our TV cable and upgraded our internet cable
4718200	4721560	see I'm thinking about it but then then that'll be when the next season of
4721560	4724760	RuPaul's Drag Race starts it's like I gotta have logo I can't wait till the
4724760	4733080	next day gotta have it you could well I cannot sashay away my cable is that by
4733080	4737840	the time it airs at its normal time someone's already uploaded it from an
4737840	4742200	eat from the East Coast showing I got friends that'll spoil Drag Race so then
4742200	4747360	five minutes of it airing on my Facebook anyhow all right I'll just let's move on
4747360	4754800	with some more news Dark Sakura I'm not a hipster I'm just hip anyway so media
4754800	4759760	molecule is spending a lot of money and it's on new stuff they're actually
4759760	4767480	trying to innovate wait it's not LittleBigPlanet 3 they basically they're
4767480	4774720	trying not to rely on LittleBigPlanet as their primary you know safety net if if
4774720	4781800	you will they are trying to actually expand into different audiences so
4781800	4786000	they've been spending about and this is from a British news source they're
4786000	4793200	spending about three point forty four million pounds well that's how much
4793200	4797520	profit that they made in 2011 but they're spending four point one million
4797520	4802520	on research and development so they're keep trying to put their resources into
4802520	4807000	new kinds of games to keep innovating so that they don't have to just rely on
4807000	4811440	LittleBigPlanet to keep them around because I mean I think it's really smart
4811440	4816160	too because you know say that you've got a company that's good for just one thing
4816160	4820240	and that's all they've been doing but after a while the franchise is stale
4820240	4825400	because I honestly think LittleBigPlanet before too long is gonna hit that place
4825400	4829200	where people are gonna expect the same thing and there's not gonna be able to
4829200	4833960	pay but for them to put much new into it I think a big problem is it's it's more
4833960	4837120	I mean LittleBigPlanet is really a limitless game there's so much you can
4837120	4840440	do with it but I think it's the saturation that's gonna be an issue and
4840440	4843920	that's not really on media molecule but it's like you know you have your PSP
4843920	4846760	version and your Vita version and you're you know it's it's coming out on
4846760	4850600	everything well here's a quote on here they say that their investments are
4850600	4854560	going into and this is the quote leading edge physics and dynamics rapid world
4854560	4858840	creation from laser data innovative routes to marketing no to market via
4858840	4863200	web-based interfaces 3d stereo optics for advanced simulation and use of high
4863200	4869120	def data capture and processing techniques hmm so it looks like just
4869120	4875720	from what I can seeing on here they're trying to branch out but try to work on
4875720	4879360	stuff it sounds like they're really working on immersion they're making the
4879360	4883120	holodeck basically they are making a holiday at clay station holodeck they're
4883120	4890560	trying to make it where I think it's not just they're extending to immerse but
4890560	4894720	they're actually trying to draw in your feedback into the game to make it
4894720	4898900	customizable into whatever they're working on Derek H in our chat room at
4898900	4902720	chat dot orange laundry calm says 1.5 million to find new games come on that's
4902720	4907240	just another way to write hookers and blow I don't think so perhaps you know
4907240	4912320	that's just kind of I would buy a game hookers and blow which especially if
4912320	4917520	it's that whole 3d immersive experience like you know you see her nose that's
4917520	4922720	about to snort the cocaine just jumping right out of the TV I want man horse

4932280	4937280	with some release dates and Loki start us off with the u.s. although I don't
4937280	4940440	like last week there was literally nothing so I don't know if this week's
4940440	4946400	the same thing but uh yeah there's pretty much nothing um this week there
4946400	4956760	is well not much I believe my pet puppy 3d from five five games I want to say
4956760	4963960	that I got laid I can't honestly well here I will get you the definitive list
4963960	4970160	here okay but yeah I seriously it was like nothing I think was actually this
4970160	4978040	week we had like three releases of some UMD games hmm there were from well that
4978040	4990280	was actually like this week but um let's see coming out this week ah yes there is
4990280	4994120	pretty much nothing so let's start off with four and one action pack from South
4994120	4997600	Beach games it's four games that were featured on the PlayStation Network and
4997600	5007280	they're all terrible including mushroom wars digger wave wave was it a

5023800	5029400	is it those are the two games you can expect this week except I bet you
5029400	5033360	anything foreign one action-packed doesn't come out this week so maybe one
5033360	5038600	game that's all you get and they're all terrible uh yeah well I mean I don't
5038600	5041840	know if they're absolutely I'm looking forward to mushroom wars because they're
5041840	5048640	for five bucks I mean for five bucks a game I mean that's not bad I mean I
5048640	5053160	would think this is no one's looking for this game in the series so instead of
5053160	5058240	being diarrhea it's just solid poop stop all right let's move to the Japanese
5058240	5062960	release dates it's a there's at least a couple things this week in Japan on the
5062960	5066880	PlayStation 3 there's a game called time leap coming out I'm not sure what time

5147120	5154920	have some stuff on the 10th Gotham City imposters on the 11th we have Amy that

5193360	5201840	3d in their house you can go so it's it's crushed through the crush the I mean
5201840	5209800	it's crushed it did it crush three days crushed I don't care done our release
5209800	5214800	dates have been crushed all right just a couple more news stories for you guys
5214800	5217680	in the classic game of the week you know we kind of sounded like what was that
5217680	5224680	anime club thing I didn't even watch that I watched it because of John and I
5224680	5227920	was like you know what was said is that I know people like that all right low
5227920	5233240	key so there's been some or there's gonna be some changes coming to Xbox
5233240	5240280	Live indie games this includes that they've now allowed people to you know
5240280	5246160	increase the file size of games from 150 megabytes to a new maximum of 500
5246160	5251200	megabytes and also they've removed I guess the restriction that all games
5251200	5255800	exceeding 50 megabytes in size were required to be priced at either $3 or
5255800	5261280	$5 making them hard to position I guess against Xbox Live arcade games but now
5261280	5265960	the minimum price has been reduced to $1 or 80 Microsoft points all across the
5265960	5271800	board so now you can see a lot more $1 games which is awesome and then of
5271800	5275760	course they've also raised the number of caps of titles that any developer is
5275760	5280160	allowed to host on Xbox Live indie games originally it was 10 now they can have a
5280160	5287240	total of 20 games at a time so neat I guess of course none of the changes that
5287240	5291000	they made have made it easier to find Xbox Live indie games on the actual
5291000	5295520	service so that's too bad we'll be posting lots of direct links when bungee
5295520	5299960	ferret tossing comes out which now with the expanded space I'm expecting Aaron
5299960	5305400	to include video clips of ferrets and clips from our show and I'm just kidding
5305400	5311600	he can do whatever seriously you need to get some of that ferret b-roll you need
5311600	5315920	to be able to put in the Konami code and just get get actual videos of ferrets
5315920	5323600	would be great ferret b-roll and it plays the Benny Hill theme oh wait that
5323600	5326200	would be copyright stuff maybe there's like maybe there's like one of those
5326200	5331600	really bad music free free things that sounds like the Benny Hill theme but
5331600	5336840	it's not yeah it's something alright I was suggesting from the kitchen that it
5336840	5341720	be played backwards alright one other story for you guys before the classic
5341720	5345080	game of the week we were talking about the Vita a minute ago and oh you know
5345080	5349400	the old saying on this show hackers gonna hack so how long did it take the
5349400	5353600	did Sony ever claimed that the Vita was unhackable was that claim ever made I
5353600	5357320	don't think they did this time no I think they just assumed yeah well it's
5357320	5361720	been done the Vita's already been hacked and the first thing that's been running
5361720	5368000	on it Genesis games yay Linux not a bad idea Sonic and knuckle why are you
5368000	5373920	cheering not Linux because I'm kind of getting I see the quintessential thing
5373920	5378040	is to install Linux yes when you when you hack the system you put Linux on it
5378040	5382680	write your hello world program I'm sure I'm sure someone did that but this is
5382680	5386160	something that people will want to download and use a lot of as the Genesis
5386160	5390760	games on the PlayStation Vita Sonic and knuckles now apparently running on the
5390760	5395360	PlayStation Vita it's been out less than a month apparently it's a homebrew
5395360	5399880	Genesis emulator that was originally built for the PSP it's running on the
5399880	5405400	Vita's PSP emulator yes that's right it's an emulator emulating an emulator
5405400	5416240	emulating a Sega blast process and I've gone cross-eyed so there you go Sony apparently
5416240	5419840	has put in some security that is going to meet that exploit moot as soon as it
5419840	5423520	is made available according to the video's uploader but how long is that
5423520	5428700	gonna last watch the PSP they patch new exploit they patch new exploit watch the
5428700	5433720	Wii they patch new exploit they patch new exploit and then they just forget
5433720	5438680	the patch and the cycle continues at some point they just say fuck it all
5438680	5442840	right remember back in the day when you didn't hack your no because you were
5442840	5447920	playing a Genesis if I hacked it I used an axe remember when you actually were
5447920	5451800	playing Sonic enough Sonic and knuckles on an actual Genesis what like two weeks
5451800	5457200	ago so so do we here at orange lounge radio we like to revisit the classic
5457200	5461800	games in a segment we call the classic game of the week every week dark soccer
5461800	5466520	dives into the vault and now she brings a little piece of it over because it's
5466520	5469320	not down the hall anymore yeah so she brings a little piece of the vault with
5469320	5473480	her in a segment we call the classic game of the week dark soccer what should
5473480	5479600	the kiddies be playing this week in America it was known as Rastan in Japan
5479600	5485240	and England it was called Rastan saga ooh it was put up by Taito and he played
5485240	5489720	a barbarian beaten shit up let's have some of that music Rob roll that
5489720	5500080	beautiful bean footage I've been hearing this game music play endlessly because
5500080	5504760	Dan has decided he's on a Rastan kick and has been watching video playthroughs
5504760	5511040	of Rastan we turn down the audio there so we can hear you yeah so much Rastan
5511040	5517040	anyway so it's sort of inspired by Greek mythology so you've got monsters coming
5517040	5524200	out and you have to beat them up with your sword or an axe or hammers some of
5524200	5527680	the weapons are also jewels and you get shields and mantles you also can get a
5527680	5531720	goat's head I think it gives you a one-up or something was it an
5531720	5539120	advertisement for God of War maybe like seeing into the future um anyway as far
5539120	5545760	as the background got graphics for the arcade version you actually had sunlight
5545760	5550400	effects and it was fairly innovative for its time like look at the background on
5550400	5554280	that video for a minute mm-hmm make sure that you send a link of that Toronto for
5554280	5560080	our tumbler okay oh I forgot Rama was queen of the tumbler now yes
5560080	5563880	congratulations on your promotion I have a hard time hitting the tumbler on my
5563880	5570640	little dinky notebook listeners get Jamie laptop I'm getting no no no you can use
5570640	5574760	that guy that rock over there that Alan was using that's okay I want anyone
5574760	5581160	anyway um with the Japanese version actually did get a full dedicated
5581160	5585240	cabinet but the North American and European ones never did there's rakit
5585240	5589840	conversions so you could convert an existing cabinet to whatever the kit was
5589840	5596800	you had any buttons joysticks decals marquees blah blah blah blah blah also
5596800	5603340	the opening to the story as what's on this particular version it was not
5603340	5609760	included in any versions but the Japanese version so here is sort of in
5609760	5613320	a nutshell I'm just gonna read from the article here the game explains that he
5613320	5617280	would be given all the treasures of an empire in exchange for a terrible
5617280	5624360	dragon's head and when you beat a stage or the rounds as they're called you
5624360	5629680	actually get a victory screen that goes with the storyline in the American
5629680	5633640	version there's just sort of the generic story you were a warrior you cleared
5633640	5640600	this crap hooray for you here's some money and some bitches it kind of the
5640600	5645280	opening scene I have to say makes me think of Conan you know the end of the
5645280	5649320	movie when he's sitting on his throne but that is another story he also just
5649320	5653680	looks like Conan yeah I mean you know this was the 80s the whole barbarian
5653680	5658680	thing was totally rocking on you know and I believe that this came out in I
5658680	5668280	want to say 87 don't quote me yet as far as the ports that came out there were
5668280	5674280	there's a Sega Master System version which I've got they actually had decent
5674280	5678200	music believe it or not the master system had pretty decent music there's
5678200	5683520	an MSX version a game give version in 91 oh for the record the Master System and
5683520	5690320	MSX versions came out in 88 there was a PC one in 1990 Commodore 64 version in
5690320	5698640	1987 a spectrum version 87 CPC version in 88 an Apple to GS in 1990 and the
5698640	5704440	Commodore 64 version the game was impossible to finish Rob what how did
5704440	5708640	they manage that had a bug in the game yikes the bug would prevent a player for
5708640	5711680	making a particular jump from one platform to the other he would always
5711680	5716080	fall short I could never make it across I don't remember that I mean I didn't
5716080	5721880	play this game on 64 but that's that's uh that's got to be irritating to say
5721880	5727120	least well for anyone who wants to play it now there is it was included in title
5727120	5732840	legends with ps2 and Xbox and PC in 2006 which funny enough is how I played this
5732840	5740440	game I do have title legends so didn't you get it for free no what it no that
5740440	5744160	was the year that you bought it when the title thing was going on it yeah I know
5744160	5747120	that was the gaming if you're thinking classic gaming Expo was the Midway
5747120	5750280	arcade treasures that was it because I batted my eyes and I flirted with a
5750280	5755880	Midway lady yeah okay so anyway who was very nice I'm very sad to see the
5755880	5760800	Midways no more well there were two sequels there was a game called Rastan
5760800	5766760	saga 2 that came out as nastar in Europe and nastar warrior in North America and
5766760	5774680	then warrior blade Rastan saga episode 3 there was a 3d fighting game that was
5774680	5779040	put out by Titus software for ps2 and Nintendo Gamecube that was called
5779040	5784600	barbarian in the u.s. the game was licensed by Taito and called warrior
5784600	5789960	blade Rastan versus barbarian when it came out in Japan it also did come out
5789960	5796080	in Europe later it didn't really have Rastan in it though it wasn't really
5796080	5799600	related to the universe it was just oh we could put Rastan on this and it will
5799600	5804800	sell and he also made the character Rastan made an appearance in a title
5804800	5812040	game called champion wrestler as miracle Rastan and now this game it came into
5812040	5820240	some censorship issues that while it wasn't really that adult content it had
5820240	5826320	blood splattered effects when you uh you know beat things yes red pixels yeah
5826320	5832640	they're right and in the Sega Master System support it actually had some
5832640	5842520	boobage in it the Gorgon and harpies were very booby and pubey and the Medusa
5842520	5850160	itself is actually just is all boobies so but I mean that was before we had
5850160	5859120	the ESRB so probably today it might have had an M rating how about that but no we
5859120	5865080	got boobs in the 80s and that's it all right there's your classic game of the
5865080	5871080	week Rastan not to be confused with Rygar which is it's especially the
5871080	5874400	arcade was somewhat of a similar looking game I mean the NES version was way
5874400	5879560	different but indeed not the same game Rastan and now that we're coming up to
5879560	5884640	our break Rob you know what I think it's time for what Polish chocolate cake I
5884640	5891720	brought a chocolate babka awesome it's Jewish eat it all right I'll have a
5891720	5895760	little bit it sounds delish all right so while we feast on cake we're gonna take

5936000	5939440	stuff with you guys in our chat room at chat orange laundry calm a lot of folks
5939440	5943400	asking what we were playing live during the break now the podcast listeners
5943400	5946000	don't really hear this they just hear that ten seconds a little musical
5946000	5949440	interlude we do usually take a break of about six minutes or so we're actually
5949440	5953360	live taping you know to to run to the restroom or in this case get cake the
5953360	5957240	dark soccer brought or what have you and we played some music from OC remix
5957240	5959660	during the break I don't usually talk about this on the podcast but I had so
5959660	5963420	many live people asking what those songs were and the fact that you can go to OC
5963420	5966060	remix and just download these for yourselves I'll go ahead and tell you
5966060	5970560	what it was that first song was will rock was the artist from Mega Man 3 it
5970560	5974160	was called magnetic fireworks and the second song we played there was a remix
5974160	5977700	from the goonies to password music screen believe it or not but I like that
5977700	5983000	mix a lot that was TJ neko with two K's any any EK KO with I'm taking it all
5983000	5986400	back was the name of that so those are the two songs from OC remix we played so
5986400	5990300	if you want podcast listeners what you could do is is you stop right when you
5990300	5993120	hear the music interlude go listen to those two songs then come back and it's
5993120	5996320	it's like you were listening live but you know obviously for copyright reasons
5996320	5999680	and so forth even though those songs are free to download on OC remix it just

6004460	6007720	into some rapid-fire news here in a minute but first I thought I would talk
6007720	6011440	Disneyland because you know I went to Disneyland this week I didn't miss any
6011440	6014360	shows because of it because we went in the middle of the week I've had like 18
6014360	6018720	days off of work it's been the best thing ever I sat on your cat yes so dark
6018720	6023640	soccer was cat sitting which of course we're incredibly thankful for and we
6023640	6028360	well we took some pictures we took some pictures they actually had the Tron bike
6028360	6033760	out at electronica so I was able to get that and electronica was open during

6053560	6056760	spring but you were looking at the pictures and dark soccer was commenting

6174480	6177080	Paris now by the way but I would actually love to go to Disney World it's
6177080	6180240	just it's a little more expensive to go cross-country and you have to go just
6180240	6183600	the right time of year because I don't want to be super crowded but I don't
6183600	6186880	think they have a picture I'm gonna get blown away by the hurricane either and

6226160	6229920	gaming news get into some rapid-fire news thank you Alan for doing that by
6229920	6233760	the way all right thank you Alan for doing that let's go back to some gaming
6233760	6239880	news so I can eat some cake all right so the game by notch mini craft it's the
6239880	6244160	you know one that he created in 48 hours last year some important to the Android
6244160	6248600	devices and apparently it's not an official port of the game but it's been
6248600	6255640	done by a group called full stad consulting and has touchscreen controls
6255640	6259120	and all that fun stuff and apparently I believe it's free from the Android
6259120	6265720	marketplace so go check it out if you're interested in that this I have no idea
6265720	6271680	why people would buy this but there is a new device called the retro 2 it's a USB
6271680	6278240	device that allows you to play Super NES and Genesis games and emulators the
6278240	6284240	actual thing costs $85 but will allow you to plug in your controllers and what
6284240	6288480	not into it and play it through an emulator or you could probably buy a
6288480	6293880	real console for that price just saying I mean I don't know why you would bother
6293880	6297400	to try to play these through emulators just just last week we were talking
6297400	6300800	about flea markets and like how some of the old systems still were like the
6300800	6305040	Super Nintendo I have over there still works so you know just go get the old
6305040	6309040	console seriously for 85 various spent $85 on something you can you can
6309040	6313080	literally I think you can buy those like portable handheld systems or whatever
6313080	6317880	that play you know Genesis and Super Nintendo games and stuff like that for
6317880	6324440	like less a lot less than that so I mean why would you bother to spend $85 on
6324440	6331360	that I got a text from Dan Duffy the focus group bear so I I just don't know
6331360	6336920	why but if you're interested you can check it out it's retro dot-com I
6336920	6344240	believe yes r-e-t-r-o-d-e if you want to purchase that and then of course a Bobo
6344240	6351880	you may remember him or not from the oh I know I can't remember the goddamn name
6351880	6359120	double dragon yes I was like dragon age dragon to dragon twin drag got wolf
6359120	6363080	something I know it has dragon isn't twin dragons like a plate no that's twin
6363080	6368440	Cobra and that was a helicopter game yes yes so about was big adventure is a
6368440	6374120	free-to-play flash game and of course features one of the characters from
6374120	6381080	double dragon this game reminds me a lot of oh what was the one that they did for
6381080	6387080	there was another one it was I can't remember now maybe it's this game
6387080	6392000	actually them thinking of anyways the game will be coming out on January 11th
6392000	6396280	and I guess it's a firm are confirmed on the official website about was big
6396280	6400480	adventure calm and you can play the game when it comes out and of course it
6400480	6408040	features a bunch of old NES settings and parodies so should be fun all right
6408040	6412040	moving on to some other rapid-fire news you know I love this series kid Icarus
6412040	6416120	of course there's the new uprising game that's coming out mmm what this quarter
6416120	6419120	at some point right do we have a firm date for that yet yeah it's in March I
6419120	6422080	just don't remember what date so at the end of this quarter but in the meantime
6422080	6426280	you can play with some fan remakes there's a fan remake out there called
6426280	6430880	super kid Icarus it's what they're calling a 16-bit remake but that's a
6430880	6433840	little bit deceptive because basically it's a PC version of kid Icarus that
6433840	6438600	uses 16-bit style sprites but very clearly a lot of the fonts and things
6438600	6442280	that are used or PC but whatever you can play it in your emulator and it's
6442280	6447000	basically kid Icarus was souped up graphics and easy mode so if you uh you
6447000	6451200	know kid Icarus is kind of a fucking hard game so if you want to play it a
6451200	6454240	little easier you can do that in this I did play a little bit of it just to I
6454240	6457400	wanted to see if there was more than just the first level in there and yes I
6457400	6461360	got all the way to the second level so there you go so they're playing now
6461360	6464280	before Nintendo pulls it down that's right you want to do that now before
6464280	6468160	they pull it down this is interesting because the website that actually has it
6468160	6474320	is home.com cast net slash tilde super kid Icarus so enjoy it now before it
6474320	6478000	gets pulled because I'm sure Comcast will get that cease and desist from
6478000	6482280	Nintendo any minute now meanwhile speaking of Nintendo a lot of folks very
6482280	6486280	excited about the Zelda 25th anniversary symphony that's going on the symphony of
6486280	6490700	the goddesses this is very similar to Final Fantasy dear friends video games
6490700	6494960	live that whole thing where they're gonna be playing Zelda music live it's
6494960	6498440	gonna be coming hopefully to a town near you at least if you live in the States
6498440	6502880	or certain parts of Canada January 10th is the first show in Dallas Texas March
6502880	6508000	14th in Vancouver March 26 in Seattle San Francisco on March 28th Denver on
6508000	6514640	April 7th April 20th 21st in Phoenix Atlanta on May 12th Montreal on May 31st
6514640	6521480	Austin on June 22nd Orlando on July 14th and Toronto on September 29th they are
6521480	6525320	saying that there are more tour dates that are planned very interesting what's
6525320	6529920	not on the list so Cal so it's interesting to see maybe they'll do an
6529920	6536800	LA show possibly an LA show like around e3 who knows but yeah they're gonna be
6536800	6541120	playing music from all the different Zelda games so it's not just the new one
6541120	6545720	so if you'd like live symphony I think you'll enjoy that God of War 4
6545720	6551480	apparently has been spotted on a composer's resume it's the first bit of
6551480	6554880	anything God of War 4 that we've seen was on the resume of Timothy Williams
6554880	6559840	who is the God of War series composer apparently it's on his resume but really
6559840	6563760	is it any fucking surprise to the God of 4 God of War 4 is in the making I
6563760	6570400	didn't think so God of 4 God of 4 I think that's that's what they should
6570400	6576880	actually call it so there you go God of 4 all right Dark Sakura no I will not
6576880	6581720	hold on you're not the boss of me sorry I was I was replying to something in the
6581720	6586800	chat room because our list I will take that Duffy away no no I will smear
6586800	6591800	chocolate on its butt and you'll have a poopy Duffy how do you like the cake by
6591800	6595880	the way the babka it's very good babka chocolaty isn't it like eating a
6595880	6601640	chocolate cinnamon roll yes video game news okay show how about some stuff for
6601640	6606520	Tekken well actually this is specifically new characters leaked for
6606520	6614080	Street Fighter across Tekken and that is shall you and M bison or as he is known
6614080	6620040	overseas Balrog or Vega sorry Vega because they switched them around Balrog
6620040	6626620	is the Vega over here whatever now I've gone cross-eyed so yeah shall
6626620	6634320	Lou and M bison are involved as far as rock band news it's Rob's absolute
6634320	6640420	favorite band ever Hall & Oates I was gonna say Abba has an exclusive thing
6640420	6644740	with a SingStar franchise so it can't be that there's a Hall & Oates pack Oh one
6644740	6649240	which has private eyes I can't go for that and man-eater I would I would get
6649240	6655160	man-eater I kind of privatize is awesome and actually man eaters pretty awesome
6655160	6662320	to it every time I think of Paula notes I think of Patton Oswalt talking about
6662320	6665020	if they had those surgery shows back in the 80s people would want to look like
6665020	6671000	Hall & Oates I'm gonna look like Steve Gutenberg I like what spazz nator
6671000	6676760	suggests in chat here god of guar god of war that would be awesome they should
6676760	6681120	have a guar mod for God of War don't they have guar songs in rock band I got
6681120	6686440	to have something that would be awesome yeah and the last but not least House of
6686440	6691200	the Dead three and four are both coming to PSN but no typing of the dead so
6691200	6694960	therefore failure guess what I have two copies of typing of the dead for like
6694960	6698280	Dreamcast I don't even know where the fuck my Dreamcast keyboard is if I even
6698280	6701320	have I have the Dreamcast version and PC version you need to have typing of the
6701320	6705720	dead day you know what we need to do cuz Mavis Beacon ain't got shit on typing of
6705720	6710680	the dead you know we need to do what we need to get Jessica iguana girl she was
6710680	6713840	really good at that one she and we need to have a typing of the dead a thon
6713840	6719120	because when I got Michael when I got my copy I took it to her apartment the the
6719120	6723320	apartment that she was living in when I met her and we'd play typing of the dead
6723320	6727120	for like three hours I bet I bet I know what apartment that was she lived there
6727120	6733880	for ever several yes yes I remember that one yeah but the one that I stayed up
6733880	6738760	for three days without sleep making a costume with Evan anyway anyway anyway
6738760	6743600	but yeah how's the dead three came out in 2002 and how's the dead four has only
6743600	6748400	been in the arcade so this is an exclusive to PSN nice now how about the
6748400	6751520	Silent Hill game I know different company but that Silent Hill arcade
6751520	6755760	game seriously why haven't we seen this released somewhere for the home because
6755760	6760120	they have a stick up their ass oh okay that answers everything and they're
6760120	6764240	currently stuck on it and the moment that they learn how to stand up without
6764240	6770360	taking the stick up their ass with them we'll probably see it I'm having to hide
6770360	6775840	poor Duffy's version Virgin Disney ears is it too much to ask for some Duffy
6775840	6783960	come over here is too much to ask for some fucking silent hill arcade game
6783960	6789680	and I think that Rob has a potty mouth and he should eat so God this is just
6789680	6794120	like a little Santorum on Horde house this week I'm not even gonna explain it
6794120	6798800	what I'm not even gonna explain it horde house calm little centaur yeah that's I
6798800	6809800	can just imagine it ha at Rick Santorum asshole all right look yeah for the
6809800	6815560	record that was an authentic southern accent I know was it oh I couldn't is
6815560	6822520	that dark soccer is it George Bush I'm not sure moving on Loki maybe you can
6822520	6825640	bring some video game news back into this program that used to be about
6825640	6830920	gaming talk about piracy all right whatever I'll take what I can get so of
6830920	6836280	course a report came out talking about the most pirated games of 2011 this is
6836280	6838760	coming from torrent freak I would think that they would know a little bit about
6838760	6847920	piracy now now Loki Tory isn't it's just a bit torrent news site how dare you
6847920	6852000	well they should still be up to date with you know what's going on including
6852000	6857280	piracy I mean come on I'm not suggesting that they are pirating themselves or
6857280	6861720	facilitating party in any way I am just saying that you know they should know
6861720	6866880	something about it anyways the number one game that has been downloaded 3.9
6866880	6874520	million times since its release in March of 2011 the crisis to crisis to the
6874520	6879560	game sequel to the game that killed PCs around the world you know but yes
6879560	6884760	crisis to number one game of course modern warfare 3 was downloaded an
6884760	6890520	estimated 3.6 million times since November so you know modern warfare 3
6890520	6894880	had come out in March and they would probably been number one but oh well
6894880	6900400	don't wait battlefield 3 coming in third with 3.5 million downloads and then of
6900400	6907760	course that ring rounding out the top 5 piva 12 and portal to there you go
6907760	6915320	surprised what's not on the list maybe anything I mean that was all PC stuff
6915320	6920960	let's talk a little bit about how about Xenoblade well I'm surprised more people
6920960	6926360	didn't pirate that to be able to play it in the US now now you spoke too soon the
6926360	6932600	top Wii game downloads on bit torrent in 2011 Super Mario Galaxy 2 Mario sports
6932600	6936240	mix what the fuck are people down the Mario sports mix that's a terrible very
6936240	6940120	good question I get galaxy 2 because that was on a lot of the best list and
6940120	6944480	Xenoblade Chronicles was number 3 Lego Pirates of the Caribbean number 4 and
6944480	6952200	FIFA 12 number 5 weird list yeah Xbox 360 downloads Gears of War 3 number 1
6952200	6956360	Call of Duty Mario warfare 3 number 2 battlefield 3 number 3
6956360	6962040	Forza Motorsports 4 number 4 and connect sports season 2 number 5 not that we're
6962040	6967280	advocating piracy but you know it's it happens we'd be naive to sit here and go
6967280	6971040	oh it never happens that's all don't pay no attention behind a curtain it is
6971040	6975280	interesting to see what gets pirated and what doesn't because certain games don't
6975280	6978040	show up on the list at all because of maybe the DRM that's in the game like
6978040	6983160	for example or like a game like SWTOR can't be pirated that much because you
6983160	6989040	have to have an online connection to play so hmm Starcraft 2 big PC game no
6989040	6993120	more on that list I think because of the whole battle net tie-in of course a lot
6993120	6995520	that drives a lot of people bonkers because they don't want to be on the
6995520	6999960	internet to play the game so where's the happy middle ground I don't know all
6999960	7004160	right anyhow moving on to a system that I'm sure nobody's gonna pirate any games
7004160	7009680	on at all the Wii U there's a new rumor about the Wii U because you know rumors
7009680	7012880	about the Wii U or are everywhere and it's a slow news week so why the hell
7012880	7020000	not apparently Wii U will also double as an e-reader this is apparently via a
7020000	7026760	friend who Nintendo approached to do iOS software ports over to the Wii U system
7026760	7030760	which doesn't surprise me at all that you know the Wii U would probably be
7030760	7034920	going after things like Angry Birds cut the rope tiny tower the stuff that's
7034920	7039760	really big on iOS to be able to be played on the you know touch device I
7039760	7043360	wouldn't surprise me at all but apparently Nintendo is also looking at
7043360	7049200	doing digital books magazines comics and so forth on the Wii U and the 3ds
7049200	7053360	apparently instruction manuals could be done this way to strategy guides and
7053360	7059280	Nintendo power you know it'd be really funny hmm but there's no way this is
7059280	7063920	ever gonna happen is if the Wii U controller actually became its own
7063920	7068960	console but it can't I mean because all the processing is done on that I
7068960	7072960	understand that they could put an ARM processor in there and how like its own
7072960	7075760	tablet yeah I'm kind of deja vu-ing what we talked about a little bit last week
7075760	7078040	but yeah we talked about how maybe one of the big things that they're gonna
7078040	7081880	change you know because the system could change a lot but until next t3 is that
7081880	7085660	maybe they're gonna put the its own processor a little or processor in the
7085660	7089600	Wii U controller itself it's gonna drive the price of those things up even more
7089600	7094580	but processors are cheap really yeah I guess it's true it just depends on what
7094580	7100160	they put in there so DDR dollar bill in our chat room says we you trying to be a
7100160	7107280	tablet yeah tablets are terrible well here's the thing though I think a lot of
7107280	7112040	it would be the fact that Nintendo would have a big audience with kids like maybe
7112040	7117360	kids are too young to have their own iPad Rob what how well did the Pico do
7117360	7122240	really but but kids could use the Wii U controller I see that's the thing though
7122240	7125800	is I don't think kids are too young to have an iPad well let me put this way a
7125800	7129260	lot of parents don't think kids are too young to have an iPad and they will buy
7129260	7133600	them an iPad or an iPod or something I mean I remember seeing on some gaming
7133600	7138520	blogs a stupid iPod you know touch freak out you know Christmas videos and stuff
7138520	7141120	like that I mean come on parents are willing to buy their kids that kind of
7141120	7145920	stuff there are cat games on iPad I mean there's there's games for toddlers on
7145920	7151000	the iPad so I'm not surprised that they would do that and I mean seriously with
7151000	7156720	an iPad 3 coming out probably soon I mean it's only gonna drive the prices of
7156720	7162320	the older models down so why wouldn't they you know parents buy an iPad I'm
7162320	7166560	not surprised parents will let their kids play with an iPad because people
7166560	7170520	are letting their frogs and lizards play with their iPad that ant smasher game
7170520	7178640	well people are dumb well as long as the as long as the Wii U gets swap note
7178640	7181840	that's all I care about which by the way if you could smile big cuz I'm gonna
7181840	7185000	take a picture for Bobby here maybe I'm not smiling big maybe I'll send it to
7185000	7190680	Tiger Claw to their little 3d picture there of all our life all right with
7190680	7199080	Duffy adorable hey swap note is actually pretty cool it's like it's it's like
7199080	7204360	it's like Nintendo is finally understanding email well I'm glad they
7204360	7212040	got that bad bank bandwagon if I can only speak now I'm yeah man I'm really
7212040	7219080	looking forward to them understand you know patching games in 2021 or something
7219080	7223400	like that you know maybe with the Wii U that we'll get some actual game
7223400	7230200	patching fantastic Nintendo and for the record I'm putting a picture of Duffy's
7230200	7237400	butt on the olr thing orange launch radio.com all right let's take a moment
7237400	7243480	to visit the mailbag every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge
7243480	7248680	radio.com and dark soccer dives into the email bag and read your favorite emails
7248680	7251640	I was gonna say we should start taking emails over swap note but you'd have to
7251640	7257360	have my friend code to do that Duffy should start reading them no Duffy
7257360	7261680	should not read them all right anyhow while I work on my swap note I'm gonna
7261680	7264440	send a swap note to Bobby and I guess I'll send it to Tiger Claw I don't know
7264440	7267280	who else listens to olr on my friends list but I'll send it to them too well I
7267280	7273000	wanted to announce that we do have three winners for the Master System contest
7273000	7278040	wieners wieners that means I have to do I think I've got games enough to divide
7278040	7285720	amongst them as well someone is from will and I will be logging into the
7285720	7297760	email when I get home another one is where is it from Rico and one of them
7297760	7305160	was hit stun so congratulations to our winners Congrats to all you wieners and
7305160	7310880	I'm gonna try to send you ones that you don't already have so and I know who's
7310880	7317160	about getting wet and if you get a duplicate sorry eBay we can autograph
7317160	7323520	them though if you want us to so back to the the mailbag I just played the worst
7323520	7328160	game in history of Nintendo DS I asked for it for Christmas because I love
7328160	7333920	Puss in Boots and a sexy Antonio voice well unfortunately the reviews I were
7333920	7337680	looking at were for the Wii version of the game which apparently is decent this
7337680	7342320	however this abomination should never have been made it is surely the spawn of
7342320	7346480	Satan and all copies should be destroyed seriously the graphics look like
7346480	7352000	something back from early early PlayStation 1 or Nintendo 64 back when
7352000	7355500	their characters look like they were made of Lego blocks no voices and the
7355500	7359520	gameplay tap the screen to the beat no seriously that's the whole stupid game
7359520	7364640	and that's what I get for buying a tie-in game I guess but I really thought
7364640	7371440	the treat puss with some respect sad face Holly D haven't we warned you
7371440	7377200	about tie-ins that's right game tie-ins can be pretty bad but or movie is game
7377200	7383680	times movie tie-ins games can be pretty bad next email bummer though hi olr crew
7383680	7387600	I've never seen the tester on PSN not the first season of the second mostly
7387600	7391400	because I'm over reality shows I also thought the grand prize of being an
7391400	7394220	entry-level tester was kind of stupid though a great way for you to get your
7394220	7397440	foot in the door but I think I'm going to start watching the new season because
7397440	7401160	I just found out a friend of a friend is a contestant we were chatting on
7401160	7403920	Facebook and I asked her if she'd be interested in appearing as a guest on
7403920	7408800	olr but only if you're interested she seemed very interested and I would have
7408800	7412920	to get but would have to get back to me to see if corporate folks would allow
7412920	7418280	her to do so so my question is would you be interested why the hell not sure I
7418280	7421760	want to know who beat dark soccer for the position no dark soccer went through
7421760	7427560	herself right I'm not gonna give any more of her information just because
7427560	7431200	because it's included in the email sure sure but we are interested yeah why not
7431200	7436200	if corporate PSN will let us then we're happy for it I would love to ask some
7436200	7440200	questions about the stuff I want to wait till the show debuts though so we can be
7440200	7443340	like okay how bad did they misrepresent this well maybe there is at least one
7443340	7448080	person it's somewhat internet celebrity that's actually in there oh really yeah
7448080	7452560	the guy does I don't know if you've ever seen them the the awesome games like
7452560	7460480	Metal Gear awesome they're like great he's actually in in the contention there
7460480	7465240	that's funny so rooting for him because he's the only person they recognize
7465240	7469920	vaguely anyway says thanks and keep up the good work and thanks for putting the
7469920	7473800	podcast up on Mondays they're not so blah anymore that's from Stan I had to
7473800	7478000	show up within an hour last week this is great having it at my house good for you
7478000	7482920	just saying okay by the way I sent that I sent that message on spa pass or was
7482920	7489400	it swap note see how long it takes to get to tiger color this is good evening
7489400	7494420	dark Sakura sky and Loki Saurus I am writing to you from a pseudo email
7494420	7498080	account for our conversation you can call me track slur I'm a longtime
7498080	7503080	listener here is my plight I am a 34 year old male gamer living in northwest
7503080	7508920	Florida I play everything from Batman Arkham City on Xbox to swo tour and while
7508920	7512880	on PC I make a decent income from working full-time technical job in the
7512880	7517680	Network Operations Center I'm suffering probably from maybe a newer condition
7517680	7521800	called gamers loneliness or gamers depression I am an okay looking guy
7521800	7525860	average weight and height I have money in a car I'm having problems finding a
7525860	7530680	companion I like women so I'm not alone I've tried POF okay cupid geek to geek
7530680	7534880	with no success I think it might be my age and the single gamer women are ultra
7534880	7539020	rare maybe the fact that I don't drink or go to clubs slash bars I do know my
7539020	7542840	schedule is bad I work Friday to Monday 12-hour shifts with a two-hour commute
7542840	7546680	to work each day but it's my job to deal with this I've been buying tons of games
7546680	7551080	that go into my never-ending backlog and buying lots of gamer where my room looks
7551080	7556320	like a gamers cache now I can have any game I want and have three days off a
7556320	7560560	week I can game but I'm not any happier I even stopped playing DDR in the air I
7560560	7565000	kids because I was tired of playing by myself and I stopped getting any
7565000	7568520	enjoyment in fact I don't feel happy you're doing anything I've been trying
7568520	7572760	to do changes from but the results end up the same I don't want to be something
7572760	7575800	I am NOT just to conform to find someone to be with I wish I could find a
7575800	7580920	companion like you guys I would marry Dark Soccer's clone thank you I don't
7580920	7585720	have a clone Dark Soccer is married however I wanted to let you all know
7585720	7588520	this information because there could be other gamers out there that could be
7588520	7592240	feeling the way I feel I'm not sure if this is just how the world world
7592240	7595880	balances us gamers out of future equations reduce population your loyal
7595880	7598880	listener track slur this message is brought to you by Shermie Skylander
7598880	7608680	Emporium Wow DB mail okay um that threw me for a little bit of a curveball I I
7608680	7615480	think it's one of those things where when you kind of let it go that you kind
7615480	7618840	of have all that hanging over your head like oh my god I need this perfect life
7618840	7623000	and I need this companion and I need I need all this to happen ABC to happen so
7623000	7627200	I can be happy no no no you have to learn to be happy with what you've got
7627200	7630400	and you're kind of like your current situation and then once you kind of have
7630400	7636680	that about you that that confidence the rest of it will come I think I think I
7636680	7641600	always say it happens when you stop trying to force it I mean yeah I also
7641600	7644560	say things happen when you make them happen but that's like stuff that you
7644560	7651200	have tangible control over you know like I I can't do this well then go to school
7651200	7656760	and learn how to do it you know that type of thing in this case you know like
7656760	7661280	with and I know I've told the story million times we Dan and I hooked up is
7661280	7666360	that we had just been friends we weren't trying to do anything and he just called
7666360	7672600	me to cheer me up and we kept talking because it worked and I moved out here
7672600	7678640	and we worked you know that's just that's like a really rare success story
7678640	7684520	on top of that you know it was just sort of a faded thing I guess but like I
7684520	7689920	really think that that a good relationship will find you when you're
7689920	7694560	not looking for one if that makes sense yeah I mean Alan and I were friends
7694560	7698320	online for probably four or five years via live journal just you know and you
7698320	7701440	know I'm sure he thought you know I was attractive I thought he was attractive
7701440	7703840	but it's kind of like yeah he lives in San Francisco it's it's like he lives in
7703840	7707520	China you know so far away and we never really gave it any thought until one day
7707520	7712960	it just kind of let's go out sometime and and we did and then it was kind of
7712960	7717200	like well we're gonna make this work and we did so you know it just it just
7717200	7720840	happened like I never thought it would and it did you know oh there's somewhere
7720840	7725600	in the back of my imagination I imagine Nelly going after Loki with the club
7725600	7734240	isn't that what a girl but you know for real like I I wouldn't like just don't
7734240	7737640	stress about it like that's I you're only gonna cause yourself like hurt to
7737640	7741520	do that and I don't think you need to go out to bars or clubs I think you're
7741520	7745160	doing the right thing just kind of put yourself out there online I would say if
7745160	7748920	you really feel like you need to go out and do something try maybe like I know
7748920	7751880	this sounds really weird but try like joining a club or maybe there's a
7751880	7756560	nonprofit in your area a political cause you can get behind the volunteer you
7756560	7760080	know something where you you force yourself to get out of the house well
7760080	7764160	when I lived in Alabama and keep in mind this is when I was effectively single
7764160	7770800	you know I did a lot of stuff I larped yes I played live-action vampire shut up
7770800	7778400	there's not else to do in Alabama I I was in band I did jazz band I was in
7778400	7784480	orchestra you know because I was still a big band nerd I would do ensembles with
7784480	7788720	other friends I would I played the end oh god that was when I was in eight
7788720	7795320	games a week for a while and I did there was even I gamed every night every night
7795320	7800440	I was in different gaming groups so I mean and I even dated a couple of people
7800440	7805360	that I gamed with like there was one guy who I was really into for a while but we
7805360	7810200	just kind of never sort of fun to make out with and you know fun to make out
7810200	7814800	with good friend you know never that's that's exactly the type of people I met
7814800	7819520	doing Rocky Horror for so many years it's almost the same kind of thing but I
7819520	7827120	mean you know if if you're making yourself into some kind of hermit I mean
7827120	7831000	you're not gonna meet anybody unless you find ways to branch out you have to make
7831000	7835800	it yourself and so okay so clubs aren't your deal you know what I hate clubs too
7835800	7841480	I sometimes go just because I like booze and I like goth music so I'll go hang
7841480	7846040	out but I don't you know go because I'm well then again I didn't really start
7846040	7850480	clubbing until I moved out here at all but if that's not your thing then find
7850480	7855680	you know I I've made friends through my temple for example after I converted and
7855680	7858640	I don't know if you're religious or anything but you know there's always
7858640	7864880	something you can do with like-minded people you know or you know if check out
7864880	7870320	actually check out YMCA because sometimes they offer not just you know
7870320	7874120	the little fitness things that they do but they'll have workshops and classes
7874120	7878520	or you know find something that you're interested in and then put in that topic
7878520	7884240	and your location and see if you can find groups for it but for and coming
7884240	7886520	back to this point is I think this is very important I think the first thing
7886520	7889580	you have to do then we'll stop the advice show I promise but I think the
7889580	7891920	first thing you have to do is you have to really sit down and say I have a good
7891920	7897600	life I mean you do have a job you you I don't you know you right but you know
7897600	7901560	but you you have a lot of stuff that's going for you for you right now you know
7901560	7906920	you have a you know the things that you're proud of and you know I don't
7906920	7910080	know this person so it's hard for me to say you know whatever they are into but
7910080	7913560	there's probably a lot and in the person who says his email you know I'm I
7913560	7918360	consider myself good-looking you have a lot going for you then you know so love
7918360	7922680	yourself yeah find the stuff that makes you happy and focus on that you know if
7922680	7927400	if the games aren't doing it for you anymore then there's another gap mm-hmm
7927400	7932200	distract yourself but I'm not saying distract yourself in a don't work on the
7932200	7938100	problem kind of way but I'm sorry reading chat but I was gonna say you
7938100	7945040	know find new things you know if if your current hobbies not doing it for you
7945040	7950100	find a new hobby but you have to be out there is the thing if you're gonna try
7950100	7952160	to meet somebody you have to be out there and I'll be a hermit
7952160	7962720	Loki won't be your dating advice my advice is hey you're gonna have a lot of
7962720	7967480	hookers sometimes it's actually nice to have a lot of free time to play the
7967480	7970000	games you want to play because you're not gonna have that because once you
7970000	7975920	have a baby that all goes away it's all gone that's good advice that's you know
7975920	7979320	what and that's that's another way to look at it like I'm not saying like you
7979320	7982840	know hate on kids or whatever cuz you know but enjoy the life you have while
7982840	7987840	you have it right yeah so there you go anyway I mean sometimes you know yeah
7987840	7991160	it's just like you know however if you want to incorporate sex life and your
7991160	7998480	video gaming you could try jlist because they have lots of stops honestly I just
7998480	8009320	go to cons that's not a bad idea why not Chris and Megsy did they meet at a con
8009320	8012160	that online oh how funny I went to conventions we went to we had that
8012160	8016160	three-day thing it is it is a social going out meeting other people yes just
8016160	8021240	I've known people who've met for the love of God use protection and you know what my
8021240	8025880	lesbian parents met at a convention oh there you go back in the day all right
8025880	8029360	we got to move on move on this is becoming the dating dating game here

8187360	8207720	I'm not at all upset anymore because I have Duffy the end
8207720	8214080	Loki if you do Microsoft Excel that constantly try to outsmart it in order
8214080	8219640	to get to do what I wanted to have visual basic yeah but see I don't want
8219640	8226120	to be visual basic that's why music sell all right I don't know I'm actually in a
8226120	8229060	pretty good mood like I should be giving an F you to the fact that I have to go
8229060	8231680	back to work tomorrow after being off for like two and a half weeks but I'm
8231680	8235760	like seriously this is the longest vacation I've had since I started
8235760	8238640	working there which was ten years ago which didn't involve me being in the
8238640	8242360	hospital or having surgery or having the swine flu which happened once and even
8242360	8245280	that it wouldn't have had the swine flu I'm still sorry about that Rob I was
8245280	8249840	only out for like two weeks not to have so but I actually like I'm so well
8249840	8254240	rested and feel so good I'm like I'm actually this weird looking forward to
8254240	8260240	going back to work so in reality we'll say yes so F you to that all messing
8260240	8263800	with my mind I do you know what though I'm lucky I'm very fortunate I really do
8263800	8267840	enjoy my job it's not I I teach people for a living it's a it's a great thing I
8267840	8272060	love my job I really do and they're not small children it's just sometimes some
8272060	8276200	of the others you know stuff everybody gets annoyed with their job at some
8276200	8281120	point you know because anytime you put a bunch of personalities together and you
8281120	8284480	know one's in charge or whatever you know things might go but I I have a
8284480	8289880	great boss I really do my boss is awesome we work so well together I can't
8289880	8294120	really complain so F you did the fact that I don't take two and a half week
8294120	8297860	vacations more often because I really should and F you did the fact that the
8297860	8302680	only way I was able to do it before was getting the swine flu you know what I'm
8302680	8309720	sorry I need to reward myself more often that's what I I guess that's all right I
8309720	8316880	didn't know I had it I rubbed AIDS all over the bear I'm just kidding let's
8316880	8327640	move on Loki all right so Nintendo being the forefront of digital and online
8327640	8336360	they apparently slapped the wrists of the owner director of icon games
8336360	8343960	entertainment and Richard Hill Whithall he apparently has released several games
8343960	8349960	in the last year on various platforms and he recently shared some sales
8349960	8354680	numbers on the website gamasutra but then was asked by Nintendo to take down
8354680	8361000	the numbers for its platforms according to Richard Nintendo doesn't allow
8361000	8365600	developers to share digital sales numbers for self-published we were in
8365600	8371120	downloadable ds titles that's kind of interesting and apparently I guess it
8371120	8376160	hurts smaller developers who I guess need to make those sales numbers known
8376160	8380960	in order to secure financing and plan out business models and stuff like that
8380960	8386840	yeah apparently though you can still kind of figure out his numbers because
8386840	8390280	he gives a total number and then you know the other platforms and do the math
8390280	8395360	I have to do math and and and on top of that the numbers weren't so good on the
8395360	8399320	Nintendo platforms unfortunately so maybe that's why they don't want numbers
8399320	8403000	out there there's a lot of saturation on the Wii marketplace too and it's really
8403000	8406480	hard for games to stand out because the Wii store isn't set up very well you
8406480	8415320	know yeah all right well we talked a little bit earlier in the show and I
8415320	8418720	know Bobby talked a lot on his show tonight of course Bobby black wolf was
8418720	8421800	on before us at all games radio talked a lot about SOPA and you know the
8421800	8425160	Internet's been talking a lot about SOPA and I'm sure most of you you know
8425160	8430520	listening they're gonna scrub it clean of content most of you guys who are tech
8430520	8433880	savvy enough to download this podcast and listen to it and understand it
8433880	8437960	probably already have a general awareness about SOPA but this is how
8437960	8441840	the message might be communicated to those that don't understand SOPA I find
8441840	8447200	this very interesting apparently they're talking about a huge what they call the
8447200	8452080	nuclear option to protest SOPA and this is rumored to be happening on January
8452080	8455400	23rd because the Senate is going to debate this on the 24th and what we're
8455400	8461720	talking about is major major websites shutting down essentially for a day you
8461720	8465920	know replaced with a black screen generally talking about how you know how
8465920	8472400	soap is bad and all that stuff we're talking AOL, eBay, Facebook, Etsy, Google,
8472400	8478560	Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Zynga game network this out ties into gaming and
8478560	8482240	really I mean this is just just anybody who cares about tech has a vested
8482240	8487160	interest in SOPA and I don't I think I've made this pretty clear as as Loki
8487160	8491360	as a start soccer but olr is obviously against SOPA and based on the reason
8491360	8496800	that it gives companies way too much power I understand that people want to
8496800	8500800	do something about piracy but there has to be I think more accountability in
8500800	8506160	that regard and SOPA is not really gonna do anything for some sites it's if you
8506160	8509200	know the numbers you're gonna be able to get on the pirate bag I just don't
8509200	8512600	understand so I know does it hurt I don't understand that it's almost like
8512600	8517840	to me like a really terrible web filter that's at like someone's office or
8517840	8521880	something like that where it's like oh I can't go to Facebook oh but if I type in
8521880	8526480	the near the IP address I can go to Facebook if that's all they're doing to
8526480	8530440	block this and that's kind of stupid you're not supposed to censor the
8530440	8533920	internet you know what I mean you're not that that's what that's what we read
8533920	8537880	about and go how can China stand that to have the web censored I mean I
8537880	8542760	understand it's just a part of you know that country and all that but you know
8542760	8547640	is that what we want to become here it's just it's it's yucky and I I personally
8547640	8551880	I I I think the Atari story you kicked off the show with illustrates it per
8551880	8556260	perfectly there's gonna be companies that are gonna overreach and the little
8556260	8559760	people aren't gonna be able to fight them and that's wrong that is so not
8559760	8562880	what America is supposed to be about well then again we can also detain
8562880	8567640	people for no good reason well you know that's that's a whole nother Oprah or
8567640	8572200	so they say but yeah but it's I think it's all related it's it's screwed up
8572200	8576200	how much power companies have in this country it really is it's getting this
8576200	8579760	well I don't get political on the show not nearly as often as she does but this
8579760	8582600	is something that really irritates me and especially when you have all these
8582600	8587000	video game companies where the ESA has stood against it you know because no
8587000	8591440	piracy bad so the ESA stands against it but most of the gaming companies like we
8591440	8595100	don't a lot of the gaming companies were reached out to for comment and basically
8595100	8600440	came back with we don't we don't really do politics we just make games so the
8600440	8608240	ESA kind of speaks for us what what educate yourself well that's fine if you
8608240	8611160	don't if you're gonna let someone else but it's for you and it's gonna be those
8611160	8617440	morons the people that don't understand why this is very bad that are gonna ruin
8617440	8622280	it it doesn't really affect them I mean as far as their product goes the fact
8622280	8627440	that they are these big companies that are gonna be able to pull Justin TV
8627440	8631040	feeds and things that might be critical about their game that ought to be legal
8631040	8633680	under fair use when these little reviewers are gonna be able to fight
8633680	8636960	them that is when they don't even fucking understand the law they just
8636960	8641400	know they can do it exactly bothers me exactly why do they care then that's the
8641400	8644520	point it was all you're gonna give us a bunch of power to take down all these
8644520	8649520	people that we don't like sweet why would I oppose that but of course they're
8649520	8654520	not gonna say oh yeah we were strongly for that because then people backlash
8654520	8658000	against them so they got to take you know the on the fence approach or oh
8658000	8661760	we're just hands off we'll let them do whatever you know that way they can't
8661760	8666440	let you know well I think that first sites that can't if people want to add
8666440	8671200	though I think to the sites that are gonna be down on that day but you can't
8671200	8675240	necessarily take down you know your server or anything if you've got a blog
8675240	8679440	or something you know say I've got a couple blogs on blogspot put a big
8679440	8684320	notice no activity on this day you know don't post on Facebook that day don't I
8684320	8689520	mean Facebook's gonna be dumb I'm saying don't blog do it because maintain web
8689520	8693760	silence you know there if you imagine if you can't use Google for a day I mean
8693760	8699200	that's gonna piss some people off I think that's necessary I think it's
8699200	8704480	necessary they should all be they should all go down so now let's see what did I
8704480	8708160	want to say here Oh frisbee in our chat says may I suggest these companies use
8708160	8711640	ocean marketing to speak for them I realize you're making a joke there but
8711640	8714480	think about how did that whole thing really how did that whole thing happen
8714480	8722400	the guy represented himself as something he kind of wasn't right anyway
8722400	8727600	Tiger class as I recall two years ago take to send DMCA notices to several
8727600	8732200	Justin TV channels that were showing GTA 4 when it first came out I believe this
8732200	8738060	is because they didn't want spoilers being leaked spoilers are gonna get out
8738060	8742260	there if not in text forms it's just it's silly anyway if you want to do
8742260	8745760	something about it that's my problem right there though that's not because
8745760	8750200	your your copyrights were violated or because someone's you know posting it as
8750200	8754520	like their own thing it's because oh we don't want spoilers coming out that's
8754520	8760320	not a reason to go and say hey I need these videos taken down I'm sorry but
8760320	8763480	that's like you know review spoiling the end of a book or something like that you
8763480	8766640	can't you can't force them to take it down because you don't like the fact
8766640	8770680	that someone spoiled the book all right so anyhow if you want to do something
8770680	8774640	about SOPA I gotta give props to destructoid to compile this pretty good
8774640	8778920	article that they have on their website they was posted January 7th talking
8778920	8781840	about SOPA and they even have kind of some form letters that you can copy
8781840	8785960	paste although I would kind of encourage you to put your own thing on it I mean a
8785960	8789180	lot of them prior aren't even gonna get read let's be real but send this to put
8789180	8795000	on our tumblr to okay I'll do that send that over to you know I'll get props to
8795000	8799360	destructoid they did and one other thing I like they compiled a list this is very
8799360	8803320	useful a list of all these game companies where you can contact directly
8803320	8807040	emails and websites and I thought that was pretty cool so you know you can take
8807040	8812400	your case to the companies themselves that are supporting this I am do I need
8812400	8818480	to even say like look at what happened to go daddy and that was who that was a
8818480	8823000	bit of a mess and talk about a backpedal there I mean seriously oh actually no
8823000	8831320	we're not a we're against SOPA now yeah right so let me send that over to Rama
8831320	8834360	and you can put that on the tumblr if you want to read more about that orange
8834360	8840560	launch radio tumbler calm alrighty let's move on with some more news getting into
8840560	8844720	some phone calls very soon at 1 877 game olr or a username on skype orange launch
8844720	8848760	radio but not just yet a few more emails dark Sakura you Suzuki who my husband
8848760	8851280	has met I have a photo of Dan with you Suzuki
8851280	8857480	it's very faded now but he said something in an interview with the Toulouse
8857480	8863480	game show so this is in French and I'm going to read it in French if I can
8863480	8867760	remember my pronunciation right no pool no to near a license party the Sega
8867760	8872040	which means we can obtain the license from Sega do you know what they're
8872040	8879480	talking about Shenmue so he's not saying that they are actively going to do it
8879480	8883920	but I think it means that there might be an interest in them trying to obtain it
8883920	8889280	for a YS net which is his company so maybe it'll happen that would be kind of
8889280	8893520	cool if it did don't you think very cool if you want I think he should play a
8893520	8901040	game of lucky hit uh-huh you know all I ever knew that game was play space
8901040	8908360	Harrier anyway so you can the interview is actually up on YouTube if you want to
8908360	8915200	find it it's the you Suzuki interview on Shenmue so all right I would be great
8915200	8919140	I'd love to see that series come back I think a lot of people would I think he
8919140	8924520	wants to finish it true no it's like he's got a story that's like mostly told
8924520	8933400	it's got like one chapter left really and what's it out all right Loki you
8933400	8937360	know I'm actually surprised that this took this long to settle but you
8937360	8942480	remember way back when I'm back before you could use USB drives and you know
8942480	8947720	near Xbox 360 you're limited to their overpriced hard drives and their memory
8947720	8951280	units which you know really didn't have a lot of space on them and they were
8951280	8956920	really expensive and a company day tell came out and you know had this wonderful
8956920	8962600	max memory device you plop a micro SD card into and be able to save your games
8962600	8968920	to that and everything was peachy keen until Microsoft patched the Xbox 360 to
8968920	8974360	block these from being used on the device and of course then there was
8974360	8979360	lawsuits filed and all that fun stuff well they've settled out of court
8979360	8984200	probably because at this point even if that were to be allowed to be used on
8984200	8988520	their you know system no one's using the memory cards anymore because it doesn't
8988520	8992680	work but the consumers who bought these didn't get anything no they got nothing
8992680	8996640	well hooray to these companies for settling but the consumers got screwed
8996640	9000280	didn't they yep what do they get out of it for buying these products that don't
9000280	9004440	work the satisfaction knowing that you know the US justice system has triumph
9004440	9011760	well golly gee willikers Loki now I can sleep at night I'm glad you can all
9011760	9016080	right somebody's celebrating a birthday this week in fact they're turning 30
9016080	9021560	years old if you can believe it it's the Commodore 64 that's right the Commodore
9021560	9026480	64 celebrated its 30th birthday this week and all I have to say is man I feel
9026480	9031840	old because I grew up on the Commodore 64 I remember having one of these I
9031840	9035720	think we got it Christmas like 83 but the Commodore 64 actually came out in
9035720	9042680	1982 I love this the whole machine would hold the equivalent of one one hundredth
9042680	9050960	of an mp3 file $595 is how much these systems cost back in 1982 they say that
9050960	9057920	is now with inflation $1400 today is how much these things cost it was first
9057920	9063160	introduced at the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and yeah
9063160	9070520	boy Commodore 64 now 30 years old and man I love my Commodore 64 so many good
9070520	9074720	games and those sit chips man so much chiptune stuff the year today is just
9074720	9079640	directly influenced by the Commodore 64 I wish I still had a working one of
9079640	9083720	these I had a Commodore 64 C we actually broke our original Commodore 64 and we
9083720	9088960	got a 64 C the white one and that was a pretty awesome machine I was five did
9088960	9092780	you have when it came out no I told you I didn't have a Commodore 64 I had a
9092780	9101480	click Oh Adam with the cassette deck by the way on a related note would you like
9101480	9106160	to feel old for a minute here are some other games that are turning not systems
9106160	9110540	but games that are turning 30 years old this year in 2012 you're ready these

9136280	9143360	kangaroo I freaking love kangaroo I played this 30 years old but the crap
9143360	9148240	out of that at godfather's pizza when I was little liberator that's the one
9148240	9150600	that's the first one I don't really recognize that was an Atari game
9150600	9156360	millipede moon patrol Oh God I used to love moon patrol we have this a local
9156360	9162920	arcade mr. dew I love mr. dew pango you love pango fucking love pango that's a
9162920	9167000	great game that's the little penguins you know they had one at Pasquale ace
9167000	9174480	and it finally broke Oh pole position love pole position Popeye remember that
9174480	9181000	and they did a game out of it because Nintendo made it a reactor robotron 2084
9181000	9183400	they had a version of that on Xbox Live that was one of the first arcade games
9183400	9186960	that came out on Xbox Live Q Burt that's another game I played the crap out of
9186960	9191760	them I know the swearing guy with a long nose everybody thought this had an
9191760	9195680	awesome name Satan's Hollow it's actually kind of a derpy game but you
9195680	9201000	know it was a it was the Midway it's on the arcade treasures for Midway and all
9201000	9203320	that and it's kind of kind of see in collections but it runs on that same
9203320	9208080	hardware as like journey and timber and some of those old classic Midway games
9208080	9219560	sin a star beware I live space duel Star Trek the Sega one time pilot tutankham
9219560	9228760	Tron is 30 years old and Zaxxon by saying 30 years that's what I need to do
9228760	9237920	for classic game mm-hmm so there you go now we can all feel old together just
9237920	9241520	think in 30 years when we're sitting here on our show celebrating the 40th

9254400	9261800	send it in but damn there was some good games all right hopefully by then we're
9261800	9265000	all playing the holodeck though because remember gaming is just inching forward
9265000	9270680	slowly to the holodeck all right one eight seven seven game olr or our
9270680	9274360	username on Skype Skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call

9279880	9285240	tweet from ramaditya night says sonic and knuckles I remember back in the day
9285240	9289760	I used the cheat that allowed me to change sonic to whatever item I want and
9289760	9293560	cross the wall I found a lot of bugs like a place you were not supposed to be
9293560	9296160	able to go there spikes all around I wonder if that was so is that like a
9296160	9298800	code in the game or is that something like a game genie remember the game
9298800	9302440	genie where you could like hacks or the game I'm sure that is something that
9302440	9307080	Loki had to own the game genie oh yeah well he's talking about on the game
9307080	9310040	gene he was talking about sonic and knuckles and some of the things you
9310040	9314160	could do with that yeah I used to actually sit down all night with my game
9314160	9317760	genie and my SNES mm-hmm and just try to figure out what different codes by
9317760	9321600	altering other codes hmm and I found a few ones like ones that turn Mario green
9321600	9326600	that was it all it did was turn Mario green that's all it does yeah makes
9326600	9330880	Mario Luigi but not really it turned his skin green all right let's go to the
9330880	9333360	phones cuz we're getting some calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
9333360	9338240	hey what's up guys you know hey guys you know what's on your mind buddy not
9338240	9342040	much I just want to talk about this sober thing I think a lot of us over
9342040	9345920	reacting first off I don't think it's gonna go through and if it did go
9345920	9349200	through I don't think it's gonna be that big of a deal I think that a lot of
9349200	9352880	people are getting worked up and they're freaking out all over nothing I think
9352880	9357360	pretty much what uh what these companies want to do you know the game companies
9357360	9362440	movies music whatever they they just want to make money so pretty much this
9362440	9366660	law going out is just gonna be a way for them to protect their content and be
9366660	9369400	able to put it on their sites and make their type of money that they want to
9369400	9373640	make I don't think they're necessarily trying to shut down the internet or stop
9373640	9377700	us from talking on Facebook or any of that kind of stuff well I it's it's a
9377700	9384080	fair viewpoint and I understand that but but could it happen to one person I mean
9384080	9387720	I like again I have to refer to the Atari thing at the beginning of the show
9387720	9390600	that they're pulling down all these games that they may or may not have the
9390600	9395320	ability to do and I worry that legal departments of companies who don't
9395320	9399080	really understand things might go a little batshit crazy and the problem is
9399080	9402680	if you leave the door or what's the expression you give them an inch and
9402680	9407440	they take a yard I I worry about putting that much power into a corporation's
9407440	9410360	hand because people you and me can't fight it
9410360	9416640	yeah true that is I can see a point there I'm not clearly I understand why
9416640	9420760	they want to do something about piracy I get it but can you ever really stop
9420760	9427400	piracy I'm not sure there's no way they can stop it this is I mean I mean I
9427400	9430120	don't mean to cut you off but I mean if you if you look at the record like as
9430120	9435280	far as piracy goes like when it comes to um movies and video games a lot of the
9435280	9439600	stuff that's like highly pirated or also the stuff that sells the most you know
9439600	9446200	I think music is the only place that actually has a they should really do
9446200	9449640	something about piracy because I mean you don't have to mod anything on your
9449640	9454640	system to be able to play the illegal download of music that you download right
9454640	9459440	so I think the music industry is the one that's taking the real heat from it but
9459440	9464300	not necessarily the games and the movie industry right you know and I again I
9464300	9468040	understand they want to do something but I just think this is going to do more
9468040	9472720	harm than good because what's it really gonna fix that the IP for the pirate Bay
9472720	9476360	will be out there within within minutes of this thing passing and everybody will
9476360	9480160	have it and there'll be add-ons for Google Chrome and Firefox it will lie
9480160	9486720	there already are there already are so I mean I just it's not gonna do any good
9486720	9490840	so I buy but I understand why they want to do something but I think at the end
9490840	9494800	of the day it's gonna be accountability you want to prove that someone stole
9494800	9499360	money from a bank they got to go to court have a trial it's kind of what's
9499360	9502960	got to happen in this case you know yeah they just they just need to understand
9502960	9505600	the internet more like they're still trying to treat the internet like if
9505600	9509840	it's the the real world where it's not doesn't necessarily work like that you
9509840	9515040	know so I think that they need to seriously look this over they come up
9515040	9518320	with you know with the better law the better soap or whatever else you want to
9518320	9522840	call it but um I'm not really that worried about it well I don't know I I
9522840	9529440	I hope you're right but I I do worry about leaving that opportunity there but
9529440	9534040	you're a little more optimistic than I so I I applaud you for that so I hope
9534040	9538440	you're right optimistic to a fault all right anything else you want to share
9538440	9541160	listeners you guys have a good night all right you too buddy take care of tonight
9541160	9545400	bye all right you know what it's it's cool that he has a differing opinion and
9545400	9550900	you know I again I I hope I think he said it best at the end there maybe he's
9550900	9555680	optimistic to a fault but you know we'll see we'll see actions speak louder than
9555680	9558700	words so we'll see but I just have a feeling the first time a website gets
9558700	9564640	shut down incorrectly it's gonna just all hell's gonna break loose all right
9564640	9567760	one eight seven seven game all our username on Skype is orange lounge radio
9567760	9572520	meanwhile we have some more tweets tiger claw on Twitter sends us a tweet one of
9572520	9574600	them is already about that media molecule thing you already talked about
9574600	9578800	earlier but the other one is about PlayStation 3 video editing app play
9578800	9583600	memory studio apparently leaked ahead of CES this might be something that they're
9583600	9588640	Sony's gonna show at CES and we'll get to that in a minute but we're gonna take
9588640	9590800	another call while the skype lines lighting up higher on orange launch
9590800	9595280	radio who's this hey guys do you know DDR dollar bill what's on your mind
9595280	9600440	buddy first of all I wish you guys happy new year we're getting some feedback
9600440	9603240	back on your speakers buddy back away from your speakers if you can we're
9603240	9608920	getting bad feedback happy new year to you how's this now I'm still hearing it
9608920	9612520	but it's not it's not killing me get out your question or comment fast we'll try
9612520	9618920	to make this quick call oh okay which is a quick story a while back I don't know
9618920	9622200	if I posted by look I said that I stopped playing Wow because I got sick
9622200	9627600	of all the jackasses kept bitching about everything I kept doing in the game can
9627600	9630720	you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you yeah people are people are assholes on
9630720	9635440	the internet unfortunately yeah so for once a long time I pretty much just
9635440	9640720	quit like whole mmorpgs then I try try a couple other free ones out there and
9640720	9645600	then I tried out DC Universe when it came out for free uh-huh
9645600	9648720	to the point of loving it so much I actually brought the down I should about
9648720	9652320	DLC sports so you're saying the community in DC Universe online maybe
9652320	9656980	not so bad um consider that one time I played 130
9656980	9664160	more and Ruth making to me we're making jokes about um let's see 16 year olds and
9664160	9669560	an all women's squad and everybody's dueling in the middle of nowhere it was
9669560	9673720	a lot more fun you know sometimes it's just about finding the right fit for you
9673720	9677560	and although you know unfortunately a couple jackasses probably ruined Wow for
9677560	9681100	you and I would argue there's other people in there maybe it just wasn't a
9681100	9684480	fit for you after all maybe DC Universe is just you know kind of better I don't
9684480	9687960	think you have to play one MMO just because it's the popular one you like
9687960	9691480	what you like there's people out there that fucking play Hello Kitty island
9691480	9695080	adventure and they fucking love it so you know what let them have their thing
9695080	9698960	yeah but it goes back to well for one last thing cuz I'm not gonna keep it
9698960	9704040	short okay after when I got to my finally hit level 30 and DC Universe the
9704040	9709880	final level I found out that I actually have to group and it made me realize
9709880	9714400	that maybe it's okay to group with people once in a while just gotta find
9714400	9718920	the right group so I went back on Wow I quit this one guild I was with and I
9718920	9723360	joined up with another guild and was a whole different experience well I have
9723360	9726440	to perfect story I got I got to hang up on you to your dollar bill though cuz
9726440	9729720	like the chair I'm saying it sounds like you're living in a hunt bees nest but
9729720	9735040	thank you so much buddy have a good one yeah well here's what I was gonna tell
9735040	9739860	you and just message me in the chat room um is when I started playing well when I
9739860	9744240	finally liked it again I did not play with other people at all all I did was
9744240	9749200	chat with the guild and quest by myself and yeah and I've done two characters
9749200	9753720	that way I did Rebecca black and Iressa both that way but now I've actually got
9753720	9758680	a character that I am doing nothing but instances with and and maybe you know
9758680	9764160	seasonal quests and little things but the point is is that I'm actually trying
9764160	9769200	to group with other people and I found that actually not every group is full of
9769200	9773400	idiots a lot of them are many of them don't have proper grammar and they're
9773400	9778520	very hard to understand but for the most part it's it's partly your support your
9778520	9784160	support group outside of your pugs you know and people people sometimes just
9784160	9788060	are kind of weird online like I admit like okay I play with my friend Matt who
9788060	9790880	is grandpa Warcraft on Horde house if you ever listen to him and when we
9790880	9796400	group together he does the weirdest shit in instances like he's a friend of mine
9796400	9800760	and I love them but oh my god like we'll start an instant so like we roll in
9800760	9803680	instance together and it's the two of us and three random people and as soon as
9803680	9807080	the instant starts he'll go like he'll say in party chat he'll say something

10144920	10150760	3 apparently you can put effects in video and kind of do some editing live
10150760	10154640	on the PlayStation 3 that's kind of cool I guess I already thought the PlayStation
10154640	10157640	did kind of allow some limited video stuff but that's cool if they're
10157640	10161920	enhancing it especially if it's free I wonder if it'll be free I somehow doubt

10323720	10326440	Elder Scrolls just throwing it down saying there's too damn many Elder
10326440	10330040	Scrolls games I'm gonna go on next year is pretty fun yeah you won't have
10330040	10333640	another Elder Scrolls game 2012 that's you'll have expansions for Skyrim that's
10333640	10346720	for sure yeah for sure I franchises that need to die oh god I like part of you
10346720	10351680	wants to be cynical and say the Just Dance series but parties they can be
10351680	10357840	kind of fun so I can't really think of anything because honestly if I don't
10357840	10360840	want to play them I just don't know that they exist that's kind of where I'm at
10360840	10365160	is like I don't think a lot about the games that I don't want to play you know
10365160	10368520	I could be super cynical go Call of Duty because I don't play those games but I
10368520	10375840	realize other people do play those games I'm kind of looking over at my own
10375840	10380360	collection how about Tetris remakes yeah that's another one I'm getting sick
10380360	10383760	last dress was kind of fun but that's back in the super scope days apparently
10383760	10386760	that 3ds one's pretty good but it's still the same fucking game we've been
10386760	10394880	playing forever it might be time for the need for speed series to die maybe that
10394880	10400920	would be another answer I would have well or at least of all that or
10400920	10405720	something I don't know I can't yeah I really can't think of anything offhand I
10405720	10411320	wonder what our chatters think it chat maybe Saints Row car her her no no yuki
10411320	10416080	says cooking mama that's actually a really good answer yeah just the mama
10416080	10421280	series in general it it's not doing well I that's a very good answer I can stand
10421280	10428560	with yuki on that one yuki also says sonic games no because generations yeah
10428560	10432320	I need this game but then I need sonic generation there's admittedly there's
10432320	10437040	been a lot of crap yeah and I don't I think that sonic 4 was kind of a I will
10437040	10441640	give you one that's just and it is a somewhat major game coming out this year
10441640	10449680	okay Silent Hill I think I kind of agree non konami Japan produced Silent Hill
10449680	10455240	games specifically me today yes to go back in house to Konami Japan I agree
10455240	10459920	Silent Hill is kind of done and karaoke revolution American or karaoke revolution
10459920	10464360	glee needs oh there you go winner everything how about everything to die
10464360	10470880	but glee needs to get canceled all right last another tweet from Zen since I
10470880	10475160	haven't read tweets from Zen before I will read two tweets tonight Zen says if
10475160	10480680	PlayStation 4 Xbox lube and the Nintendo Wii U were all coming out on the same
10480680	10487520	day and you could only get one which system would you get too early I how can
10487520	10490040	you answer that because we don't we don't know what the Xbox lube and the
10490040	10493240	PlayStation 4 have to offer and we only know about half of what that we use
10493240	10498800	really bring into the table so you'd be asking me to base that decision based
10498800	10503880	off of the current consoles and the problem with that is the jump we made
10503880	10508640	from the last realm of consoles right because when the systems first came out
10508640	10512080	I would say the Xbox 360 was in a better position than the PlayStation 3 was when
10512080	10515840	they first came out but yet if I had based my choice completely off that
10515840	10519440	generation before this one the PlayStation 2 I think was better than
10519440	10527120	original Xbox you know so it's just it's it's it's way too early to call I in
10527120	10530640	here here's also the realistic in me is like well I'm going to end up with them
10530640	10533480	all anyway because I have the sick addiction of video games and do this
10533480	10536840	show and everything so it's kind of like I'm going to try to show some restraint
10536840	10543120	at least maybe not buying one of the consoles if not to the console luck you
10543120	10547160	know what though honestly with you would have played on the Wii and stuff I think
10547160	10552360	it's gonna be pretty easy for the Wii U I think I say that now I guess I will
10552360	10557000	humor the question and I'm going to say PlayStation 4 and the reason why I
10557000	10560440	because I just have the feeling out of the three systems it's going to be the
10560440	10564520	most advanced because I think it's going to be the one that's in the incubator
10564520	10567320	the longest meaning I think it'll be the last of the three to come out so I think
10567320	10572040	it's going to have the best processor in it and all that but again that doesn't
10572040	10575160	necessarily make it the best but I literally have nothing else to go off of
10575160	10579860	right now you know so that I'm going to say PlayStation 4 just to humor the
10579860	10586280	question but that could change absolutely so alright that's it for the
10586280	10591600	Twitter's tonight at twitter.com slash olr oh actually I see one oh never mind
10591600	10595480	that's somebody new following us thank you on Twitter it's Twitter combines the
10595480	10599960	followers and the app messages now it's really weird all right anyway um last
10599960	10607920	minute stories Loki dark soccer anything for last minute stories um no Loki um my
10607920	10611640	story is that I had trouble finding a cage man sock thankfully I downloaded
10611640	10617000	one a while ago so that'd be fine and not my preference I they've had some
10617000	10621080	better songs but I'm gonna put it in anyways all right that's gonna do it
10621080	10623680	them for another episode of orange lounge radio hey thank you guys so much
10623680	10628000	for downloading your show and checking us out you know going sorry this rude
10628000	10631280	it's a step wave way way back to the beginning of the show here and we're
10631280	10636240	talking about best best games of 2011 mm-hmm it's not really a game but I have
10636240	10639720	to recommend ready player one seriously if you haven't read it yet you need to
10639720	10643200	read it because it's awesome and I mean if you're a fan of games especially a
10643200	10649880	fan of classic games you're gonna love this excuse me and I need them to
10649880	10653800	actually sign my book that'd be pretty awesome if he's gonna hit a con or
10653800	10656400	something well I'm getting coffin fit again I got to say this I think I'm
10656400	10659200	allowed to say this because it's it's out there post on the internet but
10659200	10662400	apparently in Sacramento there's gonna be a group that is going to do a live
10662400	10666000	shadow casting a la Rocky Horror of Scott Pilgrim versus the world I want
10666000	10670160	pretty awesome and I can't wait I mean as much as I have kind of a love hate
10670160	10672560	with that movie there are things I loved about things I didn't like about it I
10672560	10676400	think that's gonna be awesome because you know that theater is gonna be full
10676400	10680640	of nerds that are into it you know and I think it's gonna be a great showing I
10680640	10684800	want to I definitely I'm gonna see cuz I know the guys that are behind it through
10684800	10688200	some of the stuff I did last year so I'm gonna see if we can get all our Oh coin
10688200	10695760	it or something oh from the movie I get it all right anyhow that you talking
10695760	10700080	about ready player one we're gonna throw quarters ready player one is it has been
10700080	10702760	option for a movie but I don't see how the fuck they're gonna be able to do
10702760	10709040	that but seriously though I'll get you I'm get you ready player one legend
10709040	10712280	Zaku and chat says oh wow rocky or a picture show finally has competition now
10712280	10716680	hold on Becky wants to go to there's there Rockies kind of like it's just
10716680	10720400	there can be more than one movie in the theater at a time and Rockies just
10720400	10723720	always there's always more than one cult movie repo the genetic opera for example
10723720	10727280	is really big on the midnight circuit right now how do we in the area inch was
10727280	10732160	for a while I think still is in some places clue the movie will always show
10732160	10734540	up once a year somewhere you know there's there's other movies that show
10734540	10737100	up too I don't think it's necessarily about competition usually the same
10737100	10741720	people that are in a rocky or in all the other stuff too so anyhow anyhow off
10741720	10745480	subject we're trying to wrap up the show I was gonna say thank you very much for
