13784	15126	Tonight, January 8th, 2012.
16407	19391	Could the next Xbox also be a digital video recorder?
19811	25078	One retailer suggests a release date for Diablo 3, and rumors of new consoles at E3 2012 are already starting.
31451	32532	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers I really like salads
57165	58105	Salads are delicious.
58245	59065	I just tossed mine.
61686	62566	Into my mouth.
63626	66307	Oh dear, that's not better, actually.
66367	69088	You made it worse.
69148	74009	Also joining us tonight, say hello, welcome back and welcome to Studio 6, Tech Master Loki.
74189	74489	Hi.
74749	75349	How are you doing?
75429	77009	Really wish I could have been here last week.
77169	78990	It's alright, you had family stuff going on though, right?
79010	80630	Yeah, I had to go eat at dinner at some...
81210	83191	Yeah, well, I had to go get free dinner.
84012	84592	It sucks.
84652	85392	My life sucks.
85792	89434	All right, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be if you are listening live.
90275	95977	Of course, as I mentioned before, we are live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Blockwell show.
96017	100620	Tonight, episode number 441, January the 8th, 2012.
101160	102721	So, Loki, of course, you were out last week.
102741	105302	This is the first time you've ever been to my place, I was realizing.
105322	105602	That's correct.
105622	107203	Because you needed directions on how to get here.
107443	107663	Yes.
108003	108644	So, welcome.
108664	108924	Welcome.
109464	110144	Josh got a lot of gifts and...
137077	140360	and in times that he's not awake, I'm playing Skyrim.
141561	142062	Very cool.
142542	148167	I'm going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and somebody just joined the chat named, I love OLR.
148688	149409	Well, we love you.
149529	160759	I love OLR and chat says, SWOTOR, or as I've been calling it on the other show, Horde House, SWETOR, SWETOR leveling, which is of course the Old Republic Star Wars, plus OLR in the background equals best Sunday night ever.
160819	162561	I gotta admit, that's how I like to listen to live shows.
163602	175500	I've tuned into some of the other all game shows a few times like Dead Pixel Live, Video Game Outsiders and I'll play WoW because I've only been playing Sweat Tour for about three weeks but I'll play WoW and do PvP and listen to Video Game Outsiders or whatever it's a good time
175831	176672	Night of the Old Republic
200214	200635	I don't know.
200675	202597	I thought one of them did internet radio.
215293	217014	Maybe you can do that with diversity.
217034	221618	I mean, I know I just use it for video, so I don't really, I've never messed with the music part of it.
222418	230604	I know this would never, ever happen, but wouldn't it be nice if allgames.com could get one of those little channel things that you could install and have?
230864	233066	I mean, iHeartRadio, the clear channel thing has one.
233106	239870	I mean, they have millions and billions of dollars, but all games totally has a 20 somewhere, maybe in the couch.
241131	243293	I mean, all games should be able to get that, right?
248423	250124	Anyhow, let's see.
250204	251625	Loki, we've got to do some catching up here.
251705	259428	You were out last week, and last week was the big show where we were talking about our top games of 2011 because we never really had a proper year-end show because of the way the holidays fell this year.
260048	264090	And we all were speculating, what is Loki's top three games of 2011?
265210	266991	Come on, it's going to be super easy.
267211	268571	DarkSakura and I guessed.
268611	269772	We already have a list in our mind.
269792	270552	I think I remember.
270572	271713	I remember three and one.
271813	272293	Oh, yeah, yeah.
272393	272613	I think...
273365	273886	I don't remember.
273906	276928	Maybe one of the listeners will remind us in the chatroom what we had picked.
276948	279411	But I want to say, because I don't want to influence, so we'll wait.
279811	282113	But Loki, let's hear your top three games.
282133	284035	So number three, what did you think was the third best game of 2011?
285637	296107	You know, I don't know, because I didn't play a lot of games in 2011, sadly, because I just... I was really playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto the whole... Well, for the most part, up until recently...
297808	315775	but that didn't come out in 2011 so that doesn't count we did allow, the criteria was your top game of the year and that might not actually be a game that came out this year because so many good games come out at the end of 2010 or in Alan's case, he put Dragon Age Origins as his number two game of the year because he just started playing it this year
316095	317255	And we said, okay, you're allowed.
317676	319976	Every gamer gets their voice, even if it's a tardy voice.
320116	320637	That's tough.
321377	324318	I would say, I mean, Grand Theft Auto was pretty awesome.
324638	331620	And, I mean, it was nice to be able to play the mods again briefly until they patched it again.
333121	335082	I would say probably my number three would be...
337981	339742	Call of Duty Modern Warfare, I guess.
339982	340962	Alright, we called it.
341222	341802	Did we call it?
341822	342443	I think we did, yeah.
342463	343163	Yeah, Modern Warfare.
344223	356928	It's just fun now, and especially because, you know, the whole reason we switched to that game is because my coworkers were very pissed, or tired of me beating them in Grand Theft Auto, and they're just like...
358240	360261	They're just like, oh, we gotta switch it up, we gotta play a game.
361062	367646	You know, my boss, oh, I've played Call of Duty, you know, so I think I should be a little bit better than Loki is at that.
368227	372950	Unfortunately, what they found out, and see, I didn't play a lot of Call of Duty at all.
373230	381335	I mean, I literally, before we started playing it, I'd played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1 once.
382276	383737	Once split screen, and that was it.
384718	387520	And I didn't really care for it the first time we played it.
388880	398885	But I ended up being really good at it apparently and a lot better than them and they are pissed because it didn't help.
399065	408110	And it's actually been a lot worse now because I'm so stealthy in that game that I'll just sneak up behind them and do something funny and they'll be like, hey, hey.
409499	410040	and then kill them.
410100	412281	Alright, so you like this game because you can own the shit out of everybody.
412301	413501	It's pretty fun.
413561	420325	It's actually, Call of Duty, at least the Modern Warfare games and stuff, I mean, they really cater that stuff, especially the multiplayer portion.
420785	428509	They really have it down pat and it's smooth, it works well and it's just very fun and streamlined.
428569	429269	It's good.
430190	431430	That's not a series of games.
431671	433351	I'm not really into the war games.
433491	436013	I'm terrible at first person shooters unless it's called Quake.
436133	436333	You know,
436893	437794	But you know what, though?
437914	443317	And I agree, playing online, like free-for-all deathmatch, not free fun.
443597	446719	Playing team deathmatch online, that's a lot of fun.
446739	449781	Well, yeah, I watched, I actually watched over the holiday.
449801	451983	I didn't talk about this last week, but I actually watched over the holiday.
452063	457046	We were with some of Alan's family, and some of his brothers were playing Modern Warfare 3.
457646	459928	And I was kind of watching, and I'm like, wow, it looks really good.
460248	464951	And they were doing this interesting playback thing where he was showing us a video where his whole team...
465351	465952	and DarkSakura.com.
485925	491070	I can't really speak for 2 and 3 because I haven't played 2 and 3, so I don't know how much they've changed.
491490	499617	But I can only imagine it's about as much as they've changed from Call of Duty 2 to 3, which wasn't a whole lot.
500118	502900	It was just pretty much they have the game and that's it.
503461	506604	I know a lot of it's catered towards multiplayer nowadays, but you know what?
507505	508345	It's pretty fun.
508806	509546	I like...
510527	514591	What they were talking about that they were doing with the elite services and stuff, I can see where people would like that.
514691	522299	But my whole thing before was just getting into online and actually playing free-for-all deathmatches and stuff, it just doesn't seem very fun.
522439	526022	And I've actually played it, and I don't know, there's still a lot of people cheating online.
526362	529646	You run into a lot of people running infection mods and stuff like that.
530226	557386	but Team Deathmatch actually doesn't seem to be plagued with that crap as much so it seems a lot more fun that way and I actually do pretty well considering I have rank 5 that's pretty low when you consider there's 11 Prestiges or 10 Prestiges and you can level up again on 10th Prestige and 55 levels per and people actually do level up I'm not sure if everyone does it legitimately but yeah so it's fun so Call of Duty
557666	559588	Let's move on to your number two choice.
559669	560910	Number two, best game of 2011.
561491	567237	You know, this is tough because this game, you know, a couple weeks ago might have been number one.
568118	574505	But it's not because it's kind of like an actual person, sort of.
574726	575787	Elder Scrolls Skyrim.
576287	577849	Two for two, DarkSakura!
579391	586579	And the reason why Elder Scrolls Skyrim is number two and not number one is because the longer you play it, the worse it gets.
587800	591584	And it's not necessarily that the game is getting worse, it's just it's getting buggier.
591604	592806	It's just it took an arrow to the knee.
593246	594167	Thanks for watching!
608601	609642	I don't see any sword to the chest.
609662	611623	Yeah, that makes the arrow to the knee guy sound like a pussy.
611923	613004	Sword to the chest?
613844	614805	You don't come back from that.
615665	616466	He did, apparently.
618227	621809	So, yeah, it's gotten progressively buggering.
621849	623910	In fact, I was complaining about it the other day on Facebook.
625791	630034	There's a quest I can't finish now because the NPC for the quest is spawned under the map.
631114	632716	And you can't get to them.
633177	635260	It's literally a spot that is inaccessible.
635460	637342	Alan got a pretty amazing bug this week.
638364	640146	I should have him come on and explain it.
640406	641167	I'm going to butcher this.
641488	642048	Hopefully he hears.
642209	642729	Oh, here he comes.
642769	642990	Yeah.
643650	644632	Alan hears me struggling.
644812	647235	Alan, describe the Skyrim bug you got this week.
647992	655696	So when I go to Whiterun, which is the main city in the center, the first major city you go to, I'm not a criminal.
655976	656797	I don't have a bounty.
657317	658338	I could talk to guards.
658358	660659	They're like, oh, hey, sup, bro, like your orcish armor.
661479	672745	I go into Dragon's Reach where the Jarl is, and right when I go up the stairs, the Jarl and his bodyguard are like, oh, shit, get him, and the whole room aggroes, and I'm like, I'm dead.
672845	673846	I didn't do anything.
674466	680208	So I left, and I just did other shit for like eight hours, and I went back, and it's fine.
681729	683829	It's fine now, so I can use the enchanting table in there.
683929	684830	But I was like, that was weird.
684930	686090	Magically fixed itself.
686190	686390	Yeah.
686790	687191	Fantastic.
687231	688551	I love this comment in our chat room.
688591	693613	Zen Thrall says, the guy that invented that mem, the arrow to the knee thing, needs to take a sack to the chin.
696349	697150	I mean, I don't know.
697170	697550	It's just...
719260	722823	It's getting incredibly buggy and to the point where it's actually breaking the game.
725524	726625	But, I mean, it's still fun.
726805	727306	I'm still playing.
727326	735531	I had to kind of force myself not to play this week so I can get some other stuff done because I have over 85 hours in the game now.
737142	745027	Although I have exploited pretty much every glitch possible in the game to level myself up to the point where I can't die anymore and I kill everything in one hit.
745248	746008	And it's still fun.
748730	754154	And I can sneak up right to somebody in plain daylight and be standing right in front of them and they can't see me which is kind of fun.
756795	758636	The fact that I can't finish that quest, that sucks.
758736	764397	And the fact that sometimes parts of the land don't spawn and I fall through them.
764777	775440	Oh, sometimes when you kill a dragon or whatever, it'll do one more lap around the sky and then crash epically.
775460	776721	It's just like, really?
777201	778141	You had to do that?
778181	779982	You couldn't just die and fall to the ground?
780882	785687	Alright, so despite all the crappy bugs, it's still your number two game of the year because... I played it a lot.
785847	786107	Alright.
786127	787128	And I'm still playing it.
787329	790752	Alright, your number one game of 20... I mean, come on.
791633	792934	Seriously, you gotta ask.
793555	794716	What is your number one game of 2011?
794816	796038	Let's say you threw the third.
796298	797779	Ah, three for three, right there.
799641	803625	Actually, didn't we go back and say, though, that Earth Defense Force was gonna end up number three?
803645	804306	Yeah, but see...
804565	805145	I think we did.
805165	806966	But then we allowed the old game rule.
806986	807666	Yeah, alright.
807806	814808	See, if it wasn't the old game rule, I probably would have been number three, only by default because Dead Rising 2 really sucked.
815428	820370	And Earth Defense Force, it was pretty fun for a while, but man, it's pretty boring now.
820890	825131	It's just they promised, oh, we're going to do all this DLC, it's going to be so fucking awesome.
826112	827012	And nothing.
827972	829133	Why Saints Row the Third?
829553	831614	It's such an over-the-top game.
831634	833234	It's just incredibly fun.
833334	836115	It was everything I wanted that game to be and more.
837496	852121	Honestly, I want to finish it and get all 1,000 achievement points, but once again, there's a buggy portion of the game, and it happens to be kind of like the terrible part of it where you have to do these carjacking things and steal certain cars to...
853362	854382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
878378	885803	And, um, you know, the DLC, I'm looking forward to it, although I'm not too optimistic on, you know, if it being really good.
886103	893909	Because the new, like, from the achievements that were leaked out for the upcoming stuff, it just sounds like a bunch of extra excursions.
894269	896991	And some of it, I mean, that would probably be pretty fun, but, you know...
897931	903034	The activities, it's cool doing them sometimes, but I don't like being forced to doing them.
903314	907576	I would rather have some actual missions to the game, but it just sounds like it's all activities.
909978	910858	So we'll try it.
911038	915481	I mean, it'll be alright, but I'm not going to be one of those persons, and I haven't been.
915741	919503	I'm not going to be one to buy every single piece of download content just because I like the game.
920383	921604	That's not how I'm going to do it.
921772	922112	DarkSakura.com
941149	941409	No.
941449	941749	No.
943150	943890	Good guess, though.
944510	947071	Star Wars, the old... No, I'm not playing that.
948032	951153	I showed DarkSakura it for five minutes, and she was like, I don't get it.
951853	952653	No, I got it.
952773	953754	I just didn't really care.
954414	955454	You never won a game.
955474	957475	Not that I didn't care.
958095	960456	It better not be something like The Sims Social or something.
960496	961417	No, God, no.
961517	962437	Think more.
962497	963637	It would be easier to guess her.
963657	964298	Okay, here's a clue.
964978	966238	Oh, it's you.
966999	967799	How have you been?
969019	970380	I've been really busy, but...
970920	971481	Oh, Portal 2.
971621	971821	Yay!
986790	988051	and Saints Row the Third.
988812	989392	So there we go.
989432	992094	So after some cursing, we finally get Loki to agree.
992134	992675	So it's official.
992715	995037	The official OLR game of 2011 is Portal 2.
995357	997939	Seriously, I played through that game, what, four times all the way through?
997959	998720	It's great.
999601	1002503	No, I completely forgot that that game came out this year.
1002603	1012391	And that's really bad because I think a lot of the Game of the Year stuff, I mean, a lot of people talked about Portal 2, but I literally forgot that that came out this year.
1013004	1019428	Well, and you know, I actually have that, oh, it's you memorized very well because that's my message tone on my phone now.
1020009	1022390	Yeah, so I mean, yeah, Portal 2 for sure.
1024071	1024812	I completely forgot.
1025272	1025772	There you go.
1025792	1026533	I feel so bad.
1026593	1028974	I'm glad that you got it after I was quoting lines from it.
1029595	1031236	Where the fuck is some DLC for that?
1031276	1033637	I mean, I know they had some of the stuff on the PC.
1035939	1037400	Any other guesses what might have been on our list?
1037840	1038160	Quickly?
1040482	1040522	Um...
1042355	1060829	Final Fantasy 14 hell to the no hell to the no that would be in like three biggest disappointments of the year Super Mario 3D Land you got it it was my number three that was me Mario Kart 7 no Arkham City was my number two Arkham City was my number three yeah what was your number two I forgot um
1063926	1065487	Hold on, I actually have... Must not have been that good.
1066648	1075374	No, I... I'll have to check on my hard drive because... Spazinator says the number one game was SingStar ABBA, L-O-J-K.
1075434	1079777	I know what my... Wrong, it's not SingStar ABBA, it's ABBA You Can Dance.
1080098	1081579	He was so hilarious playing that.
1081619	1083580	No, but they also have SingStar ABBA on the PS3.
1083740	1084041	I know that.
1084061	1084261	Remember?
1085061	1087842	I remember that Tiara was in town when you got that.
1088622	1090203	And we came and played it at the old house.
1091623	1094624	But I know what my honorable mention was.
1095145	1095585	Fractal.
1096485	1097946	Because that game is cool.
1099026	1100407	Fractal is a really neat puzzler.
1100967	1101227	Alright.
1101527	1102587	Oh, Marvel vs. Capcom.
1102627	1103748	Yeah, Marvel vs. Capcom.
1103928	1105448	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
1105488	1106629	Nah, it just hit me all of a sudden.
1107589	1109590	All right, let's... I'm like, LOL, I don't know.
1110310	1112651	Quickly, our intro's running a little long.
1112731	1116612	I wanted to just quickly say something about this because, Loki, you tweeted it to me.
1116792	1120333	I've had listeners tweet me more stories about this whole Xbox hacking stuff.
1120913	1123854	God, we've been talking to her blue in the face about it since August.
1124174	1131016	If you don't know by now, I was hacked back in August and people were saying, oh, you let your password get out.
1131136	1131916	Oh, you got phished.
1131956	1132917	Microsoft's saying, oh, you got phished.
1132937	1135637	I'm like, no, I'm a little smarter than that in the websites I visit.
1135657	1137178	But no, apparently it was my own damn fault.
1137558	1142142	Well, now that more and more people are getting hacked and more and more people are having problems with Microsoft, finally it's getting out there.
1142202	1147746	Some gal set up a Tumblr where she was sharing her experiences, and for some reason it caught wildfire.
1147886	1156053	And I think a lot of it is because she had the screencaps with Xbox support, she was screencapping the emails, and it gave a lot of the gaming press, I guess, for whatever reason, stuff to chop off.
1156093	1157234	They're really, really bored.
1157454	1163079	But what really was taking me off this week, and you linked me an article from IGN that literally said nothing.
1163819	1164559	Literally said nothing.
1164579	1172941	He said, yeah, Xbox is claiming that they're getting hacked, but Microsoft says they have no comment on the situation.
1173821	1185704	So, you know, and apparently this guy on this website was the first to break the news a couple weeks ago, and it's like, that's kind of insulting when we were here in August talking about it.
1185924	1190765	I'm not saying we should, that's not what I'm saying, because there were probably way other people before me.
1190785	1192505	In fact, I know people who were hacked before me.
1192845	1193385	I understand that.
1193405	1205890	I'm just... It's just irritating that it's not news until it happens to somebody who has... Listen, just because a dude works in an office for a company that makes a lot of money doesn't mean he's any better than any other blogger out there in the world.
1205991	1212913	I mean, there's a lot of really stupid-ass posts that are on a lot of major websites, IGN especially.
1214454	1216616	That does have not a lot of research in there.
1216816	1223863	And, I mean, I think they got the comment from, what is it, Stephen Toulouse or whatever his name is, some supporter.
1223923	1224964	I don't know what the hell he is.
1225024	1225305	Yeah.
1225445	1227987	Something to Xbox, but customer service related.
1228307	1229689	I'm not going to touch on Blue and the Fate.
1230229	1235194	Go listen to that last show from 2011, episode number four, what the hell, Night Are We On Tonight, 2012.
1236867	1238290	4.41.
1237068	1238290	Go listen to 4.39.
1238350	1244539	Would have been the last one from... We had Justin on, who was talking about how he got broken into twice.
1245140	1247223	Go... I mean, that's really all you need to hear.
1247343	1251589	And I don't want to keep talking about this until I'm blue in the face, but seriously, if you have not changed your password at this point...
1252350	1259155	Do not... Microsoft is swearing up and down that they're doing everything... They're being ignorant.
1259575	1260515	That's really the only word.
1260876	1262237	They are completely ignorant.
1262677	1263758	Microsoft is ignorant.
1264138	1264978	EA is ignorant.
1265519	1269001	The higher-ups in those companies are ignorant to the situation that's going on right now.
1269081	1271443	Your money is at risk if your credit card is on your account.
1271703	1274184	I have been sitting here telling you this blue in the face since August.
1274485	1275846	Change your effing password.
1275866	1276926	It's not that hard to do.
1277327	1280188	Use a unique password on Xbox that you don't use anywhere else.
1280589	1280749	Put...
1281409	1283471	Put XB at the end of it or something.
1283551	1286873	Or put MS with a dollar sign or something.
1286893	1290055	Just make something that differentiates it from other places.
1290095	1293638	For the record, neither of us have been hacked.
1293798	1299422	The thing is, though, is once again, they're right and they're wrong at the same time.
1299442	1301564	I think Dan always played with points cards.
1301624	1305726	And also hundreds and thousands of people have been.
1306047	1309129	And including people I know that haven't touched their Xboxes in forever.
1309149	1309289	Right.
1310568	1312789	I'm just saying it's safer to pay with points cards.
1313989	1318450	The only card I have ever had on there was one that I knew was going to expire in a month that I wasn't going to renew.
1319710	1320971	I would still change your password.
1320991	1323491	You might have people in there downloading.
1323671	1324632	No, I've changed my account.
1324752	1325632	They can transfer.
1325652	1337935	They might not charge anything but what a lot of them have been doing have they been logging in and then downloading the licenses to their local Xboxes and basically siphoning all your games which can cause you headaches later on.
1337955	1338455	I'm just saying.
1339013	1341119	I've checked all my licenses and they're still on mine.
1341520	1344328	But I've also never had gold on my account either.
1345163	1346444	That may make it less attractive, too.
1371174	1374317	There's two things that are... I mean, yes, true.
1375038	1377900	They are not... Live.com is not compromised.
1378500	1380262	But people are not being phished.
1380482	1387208	The whole thing was, is all this stuff is coming from the hacks that happened a while back, and I even think it was the anonymous stuff where they were...
1387848	1399692	dumping a bunch of... And it might not even necessarily be them, but something similar to the fact where they dump the email passwords combos from random forums or even gaming websites or whatever.
1399972	1401392	EA may have even been one of those.
1401512	1405314	I don't know, but... I think EA is the weak link, and I've been saying this for forever.
1405594	1409015	Why does every single hack seem to come back to one of the EA games?
1409335	1414736	And I get FIFA 12's gold pack thing where they're taking the cards and trading with other accounts, that whole thing.
1414797	1415757	I get that, but why...
1417358	1427372	If all these accounts are being sold on a Polish website or all these accounts are being bought and sold on there, why are they not selling accounts with other games too?
1427472	1429715	Why does it always come back to FIFA?
1429815	1433680	Because FIFA is a popular game in other countries.
1434261	1436242	There's other popular games in other countries.
1436262	1438042	Why is it always freaking FIFA?
1438062	1443043	But the DLC for FIFA is a lot more expensive than buying a map pack for Call of Duty or something.
1443844	1445184	Where there's smoke, there's fire.
1445224	1448545	And it seems like FIFA is the common thing between all this.
1448565	1452226	There's something about that game or EA servers that are allowing this to happen.
1452266	1454407	EA sells a lot of garbage DLC.
1454867	1455627	People buy it.
1456287	1457148	and it's worth more.
1457408	1459650	I mean, that's really, I think, what it's coming down to.
1459710	1460510	But it doesn't matter.
1460931	1467136	You should be using a unique password and email combination on Xbox.
1467236	1470918	And that's pretty much what you have to do.
1471159	1473821	And, I mean, let's assume that even...
1474801	1476302	Right now, they're claiming phishing.
1476723	1479905	What evidence do they have that there's actual phishing going on?
1480165	1481066	They have no evidence.
1481086	1482226	They're just making assumptions.
1482567	1486829	Because all they know is, well, our stuff's not compromised, so it's got to be phishing.
1487270	1493934	But what they should do is, listen, hey, you know, these other games, and I think I've seen one of them say that.
1494755	1504161	Someone that was associated with Xbox said, hey, you know, there were these hacks that happened, and a lot of this email password combos got out in what they're doing.
1504401	1507942	and in fact, Anonymous said to do this when they leaked this crap out.
1508442	1522246	Try it in Facebook, try it in Yahoo, try it in Gmail, try it in Twitter to see if you can use these login credentials to get in access to other people's stuff because these people should be changing their accounts because these websites got hacked, whatever.
1522747	1524147	So that's what it is.
1524227	1533490	I mean, you need to change that stuff because if you use the same email and password combination or even username and password for every single website that you visit,
1535575	1537582	If someone gets one of those, they've got them all.
1537901	1543143	Alright, so again, we've spent way too much time talking about this because we've talked about it forever in the past on the show.
1544624	1551506	If you tweet me and say my Xbox got hacked, I'm going to tweet you back and say I'm really sorry to hear that, but I told you to change your password in August.
1551926	1559509	Now, if you tweet me back and say I changed my password back in August, I really do want to hear those because then that would prove something fishy is going on.
1559529	1561030	I'm not talking phishing.
1562731	1565212	But if you haven't changed your password by now,
1566092	1566533	DarkSakura.com
1584454	1586476	DarkSakura, what have you been up to?
1601092	1602473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1616599	1620960	I mean, I can, a lot of books that you get that are tie-ins to series are kind of like, oh, meh.
1621260	1622660	These are actually really good books.
1622720	1623541	The stories are really great.
1623561	1624361	I'm on the second book now.
1624761	1626021	I finished the first one in three days.
1626421	1629022	And that's just reading it, you know, in between times.
1629142	1630762	So, really good books.
1631122	1634683	I also played some Fractal.
1635683	1637324	And I installed Bastion.
1637344	1638304	I haven't played it yet.
1639024	1641124	But it's really been fractal and well.
1642105	1643845	And we picked up DJ Hero 2 today.
1644195	1647357	The girl installed the game, but you couldn't find the time.
1649178	1650619	We got DJ Hero 2 today.
1651119	1653541	The bundle set for 20 bucks at Big Lots.
1654241	1655042	So that's what tomorrow is.
1655262	1655942	Woohoo bargaining.
1656723	1657183	I know, right?
1658384	1661666	And I've also been playing Scare Shermie.
1663829	1666411	I finally figured out how to sneak up on Shermie.
1667312	1668493	Vacuum something in front of her.
1669815	1673258	She's too busy staring at it in absolute horror.
1673858	1675480	You can actually sneak up on her and she'll jump.
1675834	1679817	I think I saw a tweet or a chat comment or something earlier that said, I miss Shermie.
1679837	1681698	Because, you know, since we've moved studios, there's no more Shermie.
1681998	1685981	There are two cats here in this studio, but they're afraid of people.
1686081	1687001	They like to run and hide.
1687362	1689123	So they're currently probably under my bed.
1689143	1691064	Maruko loves me.
1691124	1692285	Yeah, but they don't know Loki.
1692505	1694286	And so they're probably like, who's that guy?
1694406	1696908	Maruko was sitting next to me, cuddling.
1697388	1698369	Aw, he just likes attention.
1698389	1699110	While I was reading.
1699510	1701911	He walks around with his tail in the air, showing off his butt.
1702532	1703372	Look at my butt.
1706054	1732898	and I was getting the occasional stink eye from Sanrio but yeah mostly and I was reading those books here by the way reading them here and looking at your video games seeing which ones I was going to run off with I was out of town by the way at Disneyland mostly it's just been that we've still been arranging a lot of stuff from the move so we haven't had a significant amount of time and also the issues with my hand are getting worse again so I can't really sit down and play for very long
1734153	1734453	All right.
1734493	1736114	Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1737535	1742537	Well, this week I didn't really play much because I play Call of Duty at work, which is fine.
1743517	1759345	Like I said, my coworkers are trying multiple ways to get me to not be as good, including as of Friday they taped a piece of cardboard to my monitor with a few random holes poked in it and, of course, blocking about 90% of the monitor.
1760525	1763867	I still managed to stealth kill a few people though with a knife doing that.
1764687	1768229	But yeah, I could not aim and shoot at anybody because there was nothing in the direct center.
1768329	1772131	So it made it very difficult to try to actually shoot somebody.
1774712	1777713	And then, let's see what else.
1778073	1781815	Oh, and I played Skyrim earlier in the week.
1782275	1786737	But I stopped playing it this week just so I could get some other stuff done.
1786777	1787718	Because every time I'm like...
1788078	1789719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1811747	1813029	I don't know the quests from the game.
1829520	1830862	I mean, obviously, they can't test.
1831282	1841915	If you step on this rock over here, you get launched into space or something like that because there's a lot of landmass to go wander around and test every single random event that would happen.
1841955	1844638	But I would think an actual quest in the game...
1846846	1849768	It would be very obvious that it's not working correctly.
1851029	1851549	But I don't care.
1851569	1852609	I don't have to finish that quest.
1852869	1855351	I'm not a necessarily completionist in this case.
1856231	1859733	But it's just still annoying, though, that something like that would break.
1860073	1866156	I mean, I don't mind if a character gets trapped in a wall or something like that.
1866256	1868918	Okay, I did mind that a little bit, and I had to reload a few times, but...
1871380	1876262	It's getting to the point now where I'm actually starting to get the frame stutters and stuff like that.
1876502	1880083	It's stopping and then going and stopping and going.
1880283	1882764	I have to stop moving for a second for it to catch up.
1883685	1884305	That's not good.
1884765	1887246	That's the PS3 crap that's going on right now.
1887406	1889487	I think I might try to get back into some Skyrim this week.
1889507	1889887	We'll see.
1891427	1894868	I'm a little MMO'd out right now, but I'll get to my own week in a minute.
1894888	1895888	We still need to play Pally's.
1896429	1896909	Yes, we do.
1897889	1899009	That would make WoW more interesting.
1899129	1904391	And I'm not really sure if we want to talk about it right now, but I've also... Like I told you that I've been...
1905391	1910433	My co-workers have been finding ways to try to hinder my gameplay in Call of Duty.
1911033	1916455	Let me set this up a little bit because this is one of the stories we didn't talk about a lot last week because it seemed like it was everywhere.
1916655	1918155	And it's not really a story.
1918535	1922737	It was really something that caught fire in a non-news week.
1922897	1928378	I mean, yes, the guy was an idiot, but it was just that guy got taken to the cleaners.
1928398	1929379	It was just like, really?
1929459	1930459	This is how bored we are?
1930919	1957670	but um it's obviously we're talking about the ocean marketing thing and and the whole controller that they were promoting was the Avenger now I think we can all separate the controller from the situation and this one guy with the ego however ironically enough Loki had procured a copy or an I've had one of these for months now and was ready to review it on the show when this all happened so Loki go ahead the Avenger controller now
1957870	1963393	Okay, the Avenger controller, it's basically, I mean, there's a couple different spins I've heard on it.
1963673	1982182	One, yes, it's created by a guy, I think he was a teacher or something like that, and his reasoning behind it was, oh, well, I wanted to make something that made games a little bit more accessible for people with disabilities or something like that, because he knew somebody that had trouble with a range of motion or something like that, and
1982782	1987212	So they had issues reaching the buttons or something.
1987232	1988636	I don't know what the case may be.
1990748	1997993	But that said, though, the way they're marketing it is not necessarily, you know, oh, this is for people that have disabilities.
1998213	2000915	Oh, yeah, and if you have disabilities, that would be good, too.
2000935	2011202	But, no, it's supposed to be something that actually decreases the amount of latency between your reaction and hitting the buttons.
2011302	2016686	And the way they do that is by putting these extra arms above the...
2019308	2021429	X, Y, and B buttons.
2021989	2029274	These arms reach out over behind the trigger and kind of on the middle of your finger for the B button as well.
2029634	2030495	Am I doing this right?
2030955	2031916	I'm holding this right now.
2031956	2033116	Do you kind of lift up?
2033336	2035658	Yeah, you're supposed to lift up and it's supposed to hit the button.
2036138	2037299	A little interesting.
2037319	2041161	You can adjust those arms too because that's adjusted for me right now, but...
2042702	2043042	DarkSakura.com
2066224	2073427	That's supposed to cut down the amount of time it takes you to press the trigger buttons.
2073467	2078750	It's supposed to make you better in games because you're hitting buttons faster and your reaction time is faster.
2080726	2090213	That's all good on paper, but it doesn't work that way, unfortunately, because you have to retrain yourself to play games, and it's actually very fucking awkward to play with that.
2091094	2096578	It was harder to play Call of Duty, and I gave it... I think I gave it a fair amount of time.
2096658	2098499	I'd say a total of about...
2099600	2100881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2119384	2119984	Call of Duty
2138951	2139631	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2161785	2181856	and you like you see how there's like a rubber bandy thing you can also kind of like tug on that and that triggers it too but this actually is much more comfortable to my finger because I don't have to have it up and put my hand in an awkward position because the whole problem I have with um with the triggers is that um I have to move my hand much higher up to reach them and
2182476	2192082	And if I had something that would work for the top two triggers instead of the back one, like this long piece, it would be very comfortable for me.
2192162	2194664	So like a half Avenger would be really good for DarkSakura.
2194704	2194964	Yeah.
2195104	2203570	Well, unfortunately, the part that you can take off the Avenger are the actual trigger buttons, or the, I don't know what they call them, paddles or whatever the hell, on the back there.
2205171	2208733	Those are the things you can take off if you don't like pulling on the...
2209373	2211075	Actual, like, skis or whatever the hell they call them.
2211095	2218083	I just want to say real quick, Derek H. in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, Loki should tape three of his fingers together to simulate how it is supposed to be used.
2221738	2224940	Honestly, it's a waste of money, to be honest.
2225000	2226741	I think I want one.
2226982	2229363	My opinion is it's a waste of money.
2229483	2231425	See, it's very interesting.
2231445	2241491	For you, the normal controller doesn't bug you, but for her, she's like, okay, now I can see maybe something that might let me play games a little longer, so she's into it.
2242372	2243433	You should just give her yours.
2243733	2245874	Here's the thing, though, Jamie.
2245954	2248516	You're having trouble hitting some of the buttons.
2248536	2249737	These would need to be adjusted.
2250337	2253719	Okay, but the buttons that you have trouble hitting are the shoulder buttons, right?
2253879	2254100	Yeah.
2254600	2262825	Okay, well, they have controllers that have remappable buttons that would be on the bottom of the controller that you would hit with one of your middle fingers.
2263425	2264186	You drop Siri.
2264986	2265227	On the...
2267721	2285335	on this controller but like it's just the problem is okay the price point is 50 bucks first off for not a controller they call it a controller it's not a fucking controller it's a piece of shit that attaches to a controller if it were a controller I would be able to take this off and play with just this and it would work just fine $50 for that's a little steep
2285575	2303511	I mean, and really, I mean, I understand that there could be uses for it as far as, you know, people, like they said right here, the rocker, you know, this B rocker here, they said, players with larger or smaller hands may utilize the rocker for added comfort.
2305110	2305910	Thanks for watching!
2324520	2332806	Really what would make the controller in general better for me is just extend the top to where the two triggers are further back.
2332926	2338429	They have also these sticker things that I pulled off of here already because I'm planning on reselling this because it's a piece of shit.
2339970	2342292	They had one that plucked, and that's the other thing too.
2342612	2346235	See, you'll notice that there's actual triggers for all the buttons except for the A button.
2346415	2349757	You still have to move your thumb off of here to push jump.
2350417	2354260	And it's recessed because now there's this hunk of garbage on top of the controller.
2354700	2357083	So now it makes it really difficult to hit the A button.
2357103	2360686	So their solution is there's a sticky pad that you can put on top of there.
2360926	2361427	I'm sorry.
2361727	2364210	So not worth the price at all for you.
2364230	2364890	It's not worth the price.
2364910	2367473	But maybe an accessibility thing.
2367934	2370436	Maybe if you have issues, you might want to try one.
2370496	2371898	Honestly, I think it could be done better.
2372018	2374961	Even if it's an accessibility thing, I think it could be done better.
2375161	2376943	And if you're having trouble hitting...
2377503	2387526	If you want something that's going to hit these face buttons or whatever, I'd recommend if you're playing Call of Duty, if you're going to... They had one either for Modern Warfare 2 or Black Ops.
2387566	2398969	They had a controller with two... It was from Mad Catz with two buttons on the bottom that were mappable to either the left stick, right stick, or L3, R3, and then the four face buttons.
2399389	2404531	And you can hit those buttons on the bottom using... I guess it would be... Let me see here.
2405371	2409352	It would be probably with your middle finger to hit those buttons on the bottom.
2409492	2413233	That's actually not too bad as far as comfort goes.
2413313	2414674	That would be my recommendation.
2415394	2419935	For $50, you actually get a controller that you can use straight out of the box and go.
2420395	2425857	This is $50 plus you have to have a $60 controller to plug it on top of.
2425877	2426177	It's $110.
2426677	2427197	I love their website.
2429898	2455594	and this is another reason for me to hate G4 but I love their website because they have a bunch of different reviews on it and one of them was from G4 where they're comparing this and a controller from Evil Controllers which is ironic because this controller I have in here is a modded controller from Evil Controllers um yes and they're fucking expensive so I don't recommend buying them because it's not you can get it way cheaper and stuff but they're still nice um
2457188	2467492	They're like, their review, and this is Adam Sessler on fucking X-Play, their review was, well, we don't like the Evil Controllers because Rapid Fire Controllers are cheating.
2467592	2468072	It's cheating.
2468092	2470413	Well, if you guys like cheating, then meh.
2471394	2473234	That was their negative review for Evil Controllers.
2473914	2476355	But we like this Avenger one because it's not cheating.
2476916	2478376	That was the reason they liked it.
2478656	2481758	So there's your educated review for that.
2483999	2487263	Interesting side though, did you hear G4 has a new president now?
2487764	2492829	And it has to do with that whole Comcast, you know, because G4 is a Comcast network and that whole Comcast NBC thing that's happening.
2493170	2494151	So, interesting.
2494251	2497455	But anyways, yeah, I just want to say, you know, because, you know...
2498636	2501939	They were trying to pull with a lot of the stuff.
2501959	2508884	The adventure was meant for people with disabilities.
2509144	2513268	They tried to swing that whole emotional, I've got to feel sorry for them.
2513488	2519933	They donated a child's play because of this whole bad PR and the fact that they still haven't delivered these pieces of shit controllers.
2520533	2522294	I got one of these months ago, so they were done.
2522614	2524215	They just haven't manufactured them, whatever.
2525276	2527877	I mean, it's fucking plastic, so I don't know why it's taking so long.
2528558	2541565	And that's the way that they were marketing it, except the problem is it's not Avenger, the controller to allow all gamers to play games, including those with disabilities.
2541605	2544747	It's Avenger, the ultimate gaming advantage.
2544907	2546247	And no, I'm sorry, it's not an advantage.
2546267	2548689	It's actually quite a disadvantage, and I seriously would...
2549369	2549609	All right.
2568516	2568976	That's enough.
2569036	2571037	Clearly we know how you feel about that, Loki.
2571077	2571997	So that's enough.
2572197	2573537	I gave it a fair share.
2573637	2579679	I mean, I played for that for five hours and trust me, I did not want to play for that long a time with that controller.
2579739	2580499	It was just terrible.
2580979	2582299	Alright, my gaming week quickly.
2582680	2586180	I don't have a lot to really add because there hasn't really been any new games that have come out.
2586220	2592602	So it's been basically more Sweat Tour, Star Wars The Old Republic, and Warcraft, of course, because that's every week.
2593082	2596263	And randomly got an urge to play Super Mario World.
2597083	2598664	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2616794	2617455	That's pretty cool.
2617775	2620618	Yeah, so I've been playing that, just old school a little bit.
2620818	2623320	And finally tried PvP in Sweat Tour.
2623721	2624561	And it was actually really fun.
2624601	2625903	I love the commentators.
2626063	2627784	Oh my god, that part was really funny.
2628305	2633670	As you're playing, there's actually live commentators like, you know, Oh, they just killed a guy on the Frog Pants team.
2633690	2634490	They took him down.
2634831	2635751	It's just really funny.
2636092	2637793	Is Greg Proops in there again?
2637853	2639235	No, it's not Greg Proops.
2639955	2641196	Such a missed opportunity.
2641236	2642216	I mean, he's not doing anything.
2642236	2643757	The frog knobs or something?
2643797	2645277	I don't know.
2645297	2646098	What's he doing now?
2646118	2650759	He's like hosting some weird news on Yahoo or something like that.
2650819	2651500	I mean, come on.
2651520	2652700	The guy's not doing anything right now.
2652720	2652900	No, no, no.
2652920	2653761	He's got his podcast.
2653861	2654241	It's great.
2654461	2655201	Smartest man in the world.
2655461	2656522	I would endorse that podcast.
2656722	2660043	I have to say, I listened to it in Rob's car.
2660463	2662724	He can squeeze out some more voice work for a game.
2662804	2664645	Come on.
2664685	2664885	Come on.
2664905	2665766	Just throw some money his way.
2665806	2666226	He'd do it.
2666946	2668748	SuperStreetFighter4 Arcade Edition
2689725	2695489	Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Street Fighter 3, and Mortal Kombat, the new one, Mortal Kombat 9.

2781434	2784517	Alright, let's see, moving on.
2785478	2786078	I guess that's it.
2786178	2786899	We'll get into some news.
2786939	2793585	I'll just quickly say follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and we're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2794305	2797008	Alright, let's get into tonight's news.
2797428	2798409	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2798769	2810537	Alright, let's talk a little bit about Atari and some of their, I guess, witch hunts over infringing iOS games.
2810797	2824126	Apparently they're going after everybody that has games that look like theirs, and whether they're just a blatant ripoff of, say, Asteroids or Breakout or something like that, or if it just happens to be a tank game with vector tanks, you know.
2824586	2826487	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2856106	2861168	For companies like Atari, our intellectual property portfolio is our most valued asset.
2862128	2876011	While we have a great respect for indie development community and greatly appreciate the enthusiasm that they have for our renowned properties, we need to vigorously protect our intellectual property and ensure that it's represented in highly innovative games.
2881332	2882493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2899426	2904367	This is a slippery slope though, because I want to say, okay, yeah, I get it.
2904427	2911089	We see these knockoff games on the iOS devices and especially Android stuff all the time, but where do you draw the line?
2911129	2919311	Because if you think about it, couldn't any shoot-em-up game, any first-person shooter, couldn't anything come back to combat?
2920271	2921332	If you really think about it.
2922232	2927376	Well, like, see, I have a problem with the fact that, you know, okay, it's a vector game that has tanks in it.
2927556	2932619	I'm sorry, but even I think in the arcades they had more than just Battlezone.
2932939	2940384	I remember an awesome PC game, awesome, awesome PC game called Spectre that was like a vector tank game, but it was not...
2941545	2944846	I mean, it was not Battlezone.
2944866	2949027	I remember the big thing about it is you could do modem play and all this stuff, which was huge when I was growing up.
2949107	2955669	And the whole reason they're doing this, of course, is because they have their own games that they're releasing on the iOS marketplace.
2956029	2961050	And that's what it really comes down to, I think, is that they just want to release it and actually get some money for it.
2961970	2964431	I mean, let's be serious here.
2964451	2966611	You know, like Arkanoid and stuff like that.
2966711	2968752	I mean, which Arkanoid isn't really theirs, actually.
2969472	2970252	Was it Breakout?
2970272	2971452	Taito was Arkanoid.
2971472	2971933	Yeah, Taito.
2972213	2974933	But Breakout, I mean, that's pretty much like Arkanoid.
2975173	2976474	Yeah, really big difference.
2976494	2979494	Well, Arkanoid is just a souped-up version of Breakout, if you will.
2979514	2982875	I mean, it's got the falling, you know, things that you pick up that change the paddle.
2983015	2988937	But, like, you know, I would say that that's more of, like, a genre of games now, less of a, you know, because...
2989777	2995565	I mean, it kind of goes back to saying, well, you know, there's fighting games and they're all clones of Street Fighter.
2995705	2997788	Well, it's a genre now.
2997848	3006560	It's not necessarily... Yeah, a lot of stuff is inspired by or is a clone of something and they kind of throw their own unique spin on it and there's that.
3007300	3028441	or there's the games that are on the ios a lot of games out there that there's guys trying to make a quick buck and they put something with the angry birds characters they literally rip the assets from the game and then they create something else or you know something that's like it's angry cats and there's dogs or something or you just you know to the point where that's a ripoff don't the masses kind of know how to tell a cheap ripoff though
3028601	3041753	well the masses do but see it reminds me of those CDs they sell at Target for like $5 that are like you know top 40 hits and all it is it's like really bad cover songs of the stuff that's on the radio right now
3043174	3046495	But a lot of it, though, it's kind of like one of those things.
3046976	3050197	They have to try to protect their rights or they lose their rights.
3051077	3052818	So they kind of have to do this.
3053318	3063262	But at the same time, I think the reason they're doing this is because they're putting games up on the iOS platform that... I mean, they recently released updated versions of Breakout and Asteroids.
3063962	3066603	So, I mean, maybe that's why they're doing it.
3066663	3066804	But...
3068725	3071908	I mean, okay, I can't fault them for trying to do that.
3072068	3079094	And let's be honest, there's a lot of shit on the app store that's fucking just ripping off all sorts of shit.
3079134	3084679	I mean, there's a ton of rip-off games out there, and there's a ton of games inspired by stuff.
3084840	3089324	Like, I would say Vector Tanks is probably, it's a somewhat, you know...
3090645	3091286	Original game.
3091326	3102300	I mean, yeah, it's inspired by the old vector graphics and maybe inspired by Battlezone, but it's not like they're not calling it Tank Zone and it has basically all the same gameplay as Battlezone.
3103501	3103902	I just...
3105410	3105670	I don't know.
3105690	3109194	I think that they should be going after the right people, but they're going after everybody instead.
3110516	3116143	And at the same time, why aren't the people there making the Mario games and shit like that getting that stuff taken down?
3116363	3120748	To turn this to 180 a little bit, this is what really worries me about SOPA.
3120948	3123669	and that whole thing and why people are really scared.
3123929	3130030	Because if you allow corporations to kind of draw the line, they're going to draw it too far in the sand one way.
3130170	3131650	Oh, they're going to take out everything.
3132110	3136411	It's going to be crazy if something like that actually passes, you know?
3136751	3144633	I mean, and all this stuff that we see is just evidence of that because Atari may overreach in trying to protect their stuff.
3144833	3149994	And who's to say, you know, other companies... Do you trust a lot of these companies to draw the line?
3150834	3151334	Of course not.
3151374	3152935	And here's the funny thing too.
3152995	3164678	Say for example I make a game or something that's pretty original and I release it out there and Atari goes and I consider ripping off some of my ideas or something like that.
3165419	3173801	This game is too much like Custer's Revenge that Loki made and so we have the rights to this game even though it was really a third party.
3173821	3178443	Let's say for example here's an example that's not necessarily accurate but
3180745	3200744	was it the ferret tossing game let's just say the ferret tossing game comes out and it's too much like Defender with the whole scrolling left and right and the people on the ground too much like Defender or okay maybe that's a bad example let's just say let's say say I release the game out there and all of a sudden you know Atari comes out or not even necessarily Atari just some company comes out and
3201725	3202486	A major company.
3203448	3205411	And puts out a game on iOS or something like that.
3205471	3206774	It's very similar to my game.
3207254	3210600	As far as all the original aspects of that game, it's very similar to that.
3211121	3211782	I myself...
3212765	3215027	Go to Apple and say, hey, I want you to take this down.
3215668	3216369	Are they going to do it?
3216889	3224898	Probably not because this major company that has a lot more money invested into the App Store than I do, and they're just probably going to ignore what I say.
3225238	3230384	Yet if Apple comes and says, hey, we don't like ferret tossing or whatever like that, even though it –
3231605	3234066	Vaguely resembles something that they may have done.
3234206	3235906	They will take it down without a blink of an eye.
3235926	3237067	Who's going to know where to draw the line?
3238667	3241728	Do you trust the government to draw the line?
3242348	3245389	Do you think senators and all them play video games?
3246309	3250111	I think one senator came out and said, well, a lot of my staff does play Mortal Kombat.
3250131	3254172	That was the most video game keen thing I've ever heard.
3255239	3255899	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3274412	3289877	I understand that not everybody plays games out there, but I would assume nowadays that the vast majority of the populace plays games in some form or another, not necessarily console games, but at least on the internet, the occasional phone game or something like that.
3290037	3301280	And if these people representing us don't have any fucking clue about what's going on out there, and they just don't care, they'd be like, well, I don't watch TV, so why should I protect the rights of the people that want to watch TV?
3301340	3301560	I mean...
3302961	3310369	that's just not good you need to get these people out anyhow, tangent, sorry about that but it's important it's kind of stuff that's going on right now
3310834	3312375	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
3333634	3339259	According to Best Buy, and this is, again, to be fair, it's not the whole damn corporation.
3339299	3349367	It's one store that apparently was in Minnesota where the Twitter user was that had a standee that said Diablo 3, midnight opening, available for purchase 12.01 a.m.
3349567	3351688	on February 1st as the launch date.
3351748	3353450	And February, by the way, was spelled wrong.
3355511	3357153	Well, there's been this whole... Was it missing an R?
3357293	3358273	There's this whole back and forth.
3358594	3361336	F-E-B-U-R instead of R-U.
3361943	3362323	Febr.
3362723	3365505	Yeah, which, granted, February's a tricky word.
3365525	3371248	It's probably one of the more common misspelled words, but still, clearly not an official Blizzard product if that's the case.
3371748	3373649	Now there was this whole back and forth that went on.
3374589	3389237	A UK retailer kind of clarified the date too and showed a February 3rd date, and then there was this whole other back and forth where the Best Buy was actually called by the gaming press and that the sign was actually taken down,
3389637	3404464	and then Bashyok, one of the community managers over at Blizzard, actually said on Twitter, LOL, we can't stop shops from doing whatever they want to do, I'm paraphrasing here, but retailers will find out when the rest of you do, basically when it's in an official press release.
3404784	3407605	But certainly there's a lot of back and forth going on about the release date.
3408045	3409786	Loki, you're on the inside a little bit.
3410046	3411047	You're shaking your head over there.
3411207	3413328	And then there's Micah Whipple.
3413888	3414668	That's Bashyok.
3416469	3418170	No, they have not announced an official date yet.
3418590	3419471	You'll know when they do.
3448570	3460319	for Warcraft, and the fact that you're going to have probably a million people getting it for free because they're committed to WoW, and they're going to drop it at a time where it's going to distract them from WoW because nothing's going on in WoW.
3460600	3462361	So I think end of March is reasonable.
3462561	3471248	And they're also going to be starting their marketing campaign, which will be massive, and so one month lead time is not enough.
3471568	3474571	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
3490387	3516584	it's fucking done and the problem is it has to do with the whole it's the auction house thing that's getting tied up in Korea as part of it and now they're using this as an excuse to put more into the game which is yet to be revealed but I don't think it's I think a lot of this is to make sure that legally that auction house thing gets clearance in all the countries I honestly believe that I think this game should have been out last year and I think they were going to announce it at BlizzCon for a December release and change their tune when Korea happened so
3517364	3517684	We'll see.
3518665	3523227	Virtual M in our chatroom says the website does list it as February 1st if you go to BestBuy.com.
3523267	3524448	But placeholder dates are super common.
3524468	3525248	It's a placeholder date.
3526029	3531392	It's probably, if I remember correctly, the last update we got from them was Q1 2012.
3531872	3535374	And that's kind of an... You just place a placeholder date.
3535494	3540477	Usually, like I used to put it on a weird date like a Saturday or something like that in our system so that...
3541018	3544824	I know it's a placeholder date, but yeah, there's no date for it yet.
3545104	3550433	In fact, I'm 100% sure there's not an official date for it yet.
3550534	3554059	Although I haven't gotten an update from Activision in a while, so probably next time I get it.
3554676	3561519	Well, rumors are the news of a release date could be coming out next week, as early as next week.
3561679	3568023	But I think a lot of that's wishful thinking on the community and how sometimes that snowballs into, oh, this is news now.
3568043	3574966	Probably what it was is a store jumped the gun and they built some POP for the store.
3575186	3600775	and plus if and Virtual M says the website list is that as this that's actually Virtual M probably just explained where the issue came from Best Buy didn't get that date from uh from Blizzard they got it from themselves probably in their own system and the store manager was like oh we gotta we gotta make sales for this let's get a sign made up and we're gonna we're gonna push more sales of this and it's February 1st in our system right here props to them for being you know uh
3601115	3602057	Way to take initiative!
3602297	3604761	Take initiative, but at the same time you need to spell.
3608428	3611172	Alright, let's move on to DarkSakura with some other gaming news.
3611192	3611934	This is not a rumor.
3612354	3613096	Not a rumor.
3616950	3618431	It's about Kaz Hirai.
3619471	3619952	Guess what?
3620532	3622633	He's being promoted to president of Sony.
3623174	3626956	That was actually put up by Nikkei, by the Japanese Stock Exchange.
3628537	3630779	He's going to be replacing Howard Stringer.
3631559	3638184	The theory is by April it should be going on, but they have to finish everything through a board meeting.
3639165	3642848	and Stringer is staying on as the chairman and CEO.
3643669	3649093	So, yeah, we get a lot more Ridge Racer and giant enemy craps.
3651436	3655159	But man, Sony's kind of in relatively crappy shape.
3656519	3659100	Well, first off, let me play this, then we'll come back.
3659120	3666143	Because in honor of Kaz Harai ascending to the throne at the top of Sony, I think we have to play our very favorite clip from 2006.
3666203	3669664	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.
3670085	3671605	Ridge Racer!
3672806	3677908	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.
3679186	3683389	Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.
3683930	3685451	Ridge Racer!
3686212	3695218	Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
3695939	3698241	So here's this giant enemy crab.
3698821	3700342	Ridge Racer!
3701383	3705186	And you attack its weak point for massive damage.
3705486	3706367	It's Ridge Racer!
3707601	3709062	Ridge Racer!
3709203	3715768	PlayStation 3 will retail for 599 US Dollars 599 US Dollars 599 US Dollars Giant enemy crab 599 599 599 US Dollars It's Ridge Racer!
3725578	3726839	Ridge Racer
3746172	3747053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3771730	3773611	However, look at that clip.
3774072	3777414	This is just history repeating itself all over again, isn't it?
3778135	3779176	It's too expensive.
3780176	3783479	The games are, you know, hit and miss.
3783499	3784480	I gotta give them credit.
3784500	3785921	There is a lot of interesting, stunning stuff.
3785941	3788242	And I think a lot of people are really turned off by the price right now.
3788663	3791345	And in some ways, I kind of see history repeating itself here.
3791845	3795368	I don't think I would write off the Vita as a horrific failure yet.
3795568	3797890	I mean, it hasn't launched here in the US for one.
3798510	3800832	I don't know if it's gonna... I think it'll sell more than...
3801292	3806616	PSP is due in the same week, but I think the 3DS is going to stay on top.
3806636	3808597	There is nothing coming out for the PSP.
3808978	3809338	Nothing.
3810899	3813121	One game, but it's a visual novel.
3814238	3822284	If I can also point out something, last fiscal quarter, Sony lost 1.6 billion yen, which is about $20 million.
3822324	3825467	Or 13 million pounds.
3826248	3828990	So, I mean, but it might age well.
3829050	3829550	You never know.
3829610	3832693	Like the PlayStation 3, everybody gave it shit in the beginning.
3832933	3833774	Everybody gave it shit.
3833834	3834934	But it's come a long way.
3835395	3840879	And right now, you know, especially with everything we were saying with Microsoft at the top of the show, PlayStation 3...
3842701	3844062	It's a pretty good system right now.
3844242	3848765	It really depends on the games you want and the exclusives and all that, but it's a worthy competitor to the Xbox 360.
3848805	3850206	I don't think anyone would have said that in 2006.
3850526	3858772	And honestly, I think with the 3DS and stuff, I don't see them squeezing out a lot more power out of that system than the stuff that's out right now.
3858812	3864316	I mean, sure, there's going to be some games that look pretty nice and can do a little bit more, but 3D is all they got.
3864496	3866798	I mean, if you don't like the 3D, you got to DS.
3866978	3868199	I mean, that's pretty much it.
3868433	3870236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3883453	3908308	Where eventually, a couple months later, the older DSs were outselling the 3DS And now look where the 3DS is I mean, all it took was a few powerhouse games And now nobody's joking about the 3DS Everybody's like, within a matter of months Everybody's like, okay, yeah, 3DS, here to stay It's happening No one's arguing that the fact that the 3DS launch versus the Vita launch I mean, the launch games are way better on the Vita There's actually stuff that people would like on there
3909435	3911856	I'm probably not going to get one at launch because it is too damn expensive.
3912056	3915717	And honestly, I don't play my 3DS enough.
3915797	3921679	I mean, fuck, I've only played Super Mario 3D Land once, and I'm not going to buy any system.
3922139	3927661	GameGuru in our chatroom says, well, yeah, 3DS stole Monster Hunter, which is what everyone bought the PSP for in Japan.
3928021	3931543	So, you know, those few key games can really sell a system.
3932663	3939470	I mean, you cannot deny that Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 is the reason why 3DS, nobody's, you know, joking about it anymore.
3940912	3942534	And Monster Hunter in Japan, certainly.
3943074	3944496	You know, so, anyhow.
3945497	3949501	Alright, so, Kazurai, I mean, it'll...
3950541	3951842	These things happen, you know.
3951982	3953062	But don't buy Ridge Racer.
3953442	3955443	Do not buy Ridge Racer for the Vita.
3955703	3969889	If you're going to buy a game for the Vita, seriously, if you're trying to buy a cheap game, if you're looking to buy a cheap game from Namco, buy Touch My Katamari because that's $30 and you get a full game versus $30 and get three tracks and five cars.
3970469	3974611	All My Eyes in chat says, but Sony doesn't have a system seller like Mario or Mario Kart.
3975191	3977893	They do have Uncharted, which is a pretty big deal over here.
3978054	3979114	They have Uncharted.
3979175	3980115	They have Wipeout.
3980155	3984619	If you like Wipeout, they have... Well, Hot Shots Golf actually did pretty well in Japan.
3984639	3986961	It's not right at launch.
3987181	3989363	I wouldn't put Wipeout on the same level as Mario Kart.
3989403	3989924	I really wouldn't.
3990504	3993627	It's not at launch, but... Well, they have Mod Nation Racers.
3993647	3994447	That's a launch title.
3994467	3995808	I wouldn't put that on the same level as Mario Kart.
3996309	3999832	I'm like, Sony's big things are God of War, Uncharted.
3999872	4001613	Well, within a month, LittleBigPlanet.
4002434	4002934	That'll be big.
4003095	4003235	Yeah.
4004636	4019074	Luminous for me and third party games Luminous I don't see as a launch sales well I haven't gotten the Ubisoft updates yet but I haven't seen any there to launch stuff but in third party stuff I mean you've got Ninja Gaiden Sigma I mean that's a pretty hardcore game
4019895	4025000	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Blaze Blue, Continuum Shift Extend, the MMA game from 505, Supremacy MMA, and
4035151	4041854	I know there's a FIFA game and Ridge Racer, Touch My Katamari, which looks pretty good.
4042074	4043114	There's a lot of good games.
4043675	4046476	It's not like where, huh, well, let's see.
4046576	4049797	There's Nintendogs and a submarine game.
4049957	4050738	Oh, and Pilotwings.
4051478	4052018	Steel Diver.
4052398	4052639	All right.
4053419	4058461	Rama in our chat says, if Sony knocked the price of the Vita down to $199, they wouldn't need a system seller per se.
4058861	4060302	They'd be losing a lot of money.
4061082	4062783	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4062803	4064485	But isn't it common to lose money on systems?
4064525	4065445	You make it back up with the games?
4065886	4068768	Plus, the Vita does have a lot that's not just games.
4069028	4070089	That's another thing.
4070129	4075153	It does have strengths in... Just like the PSP had the web browser, had the MP3s.
4075413	4077334	People call into the show on their PSPs.
4077415	4077635	I mean...
4078275	4098696	you know let's see all my eyes agree it's true if they knock the price down to $199 I would buy it and Yuki follows it up with same so the price is they're not going to lose $100 on every system I mean that's just stupid I mean it's stupid but at the same time I think it's fucking retarded that I've got to buy another memory card that doesn't come with the system I mean
4099196	4103498	Hell, the original PSP, I think, came with a 32 megabyte memory card.
4103578	4107039	I agree that if they wanted to get, they would put a small memory card in there.
4107099	4111841	Yeah, like, I mean, even half, not even half a gig, but like, let's do a one gig card.
4111961	4115883	I mean, those things cannot be the price to manufacture that they're charging.
4116083	4118064	I don't think they would be taking a big loss by throwing one in.
4118184	4119304	And I think that would really sweeten the pot.
4119324	4124366	Because I kid you not, every single one of those games requires a memory card.
4124647	4126467	And so here's a fun situation.
4127008	4127928	I go buy a Vita.
4128288	4129630	And they're sold out of memory cards.
4130010	4131612	Fuck, I can't play anything.
4132973	4134034	Alright, we gotta move on.
4134074	4136857	We're running long in Part A. Let's move on with some more news, Loki.
4137778	4139360	That's just like a great plan right there.
4140120	4140741	Hey, guess what?
4141122	4150431	Apparently, there's some insiders that say that there's gonna be the new unveiling of a new Xbox and new PlayStation, this E3.
4151292	4163887	and they apparently have it from a very very very very very very very very very reliable source and this is MCV reporting this as well that both of these new consoles will be making their debut at E3
4165782	4167803	I'm not surprised.
4168223	4173365	Obviously, though, that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be out this year or even next year.
4173985	4176206	I could see them coming out maybe fall of next year.
4176906	4180848	I call bull on this story because I would believe the Xbox.
4181448	4186770	I think it's about time for the Xbox to show off their next console, but I don't think PlayStation 4.
4187510	4188551	I don't think we need it yet.
4189211	4192272	I feel like PlayStation 3 took so long to get to its prime that
4192892	4195494	I almost kind of believe the whole 10-year cycle thing.
4195554	4201817	I think PlayStation 4 coming out this soon, showing it this year, I don't know.
4202197	4204338	I think it's the Vita.
4204418	4205699	They've got to push the Vita.
4205879	4207400	They've got to push that through the holidays.
4207420	4208540	You don't understand, though, Rob.
4208720	4212942	A 10-year cycle doesn't necessarily mean that, boom, after 10 years they launch a new console.
4213223	4215924	It means that they launch a new console and it overlaps for three years.
4216204	4222652	I just... In my gut, you know, just says there can't be the PlayStation 4 this early.
4223012	4225035	It's just too damn early for the PlayStation 4.
4225535	4226977	It's a reliable source, though.
4227017	4228219	It's so reliable.
4228299	4230261	The source and the reliability.
4231122	4233905	I mean, it's so reliable.
4235954	4238498	I want to get their quote because it was hilarious.
4243005	4243866	Nope, don't have the quote.
4244407	4244668	Oh, well.
4245309	4246991	There's one guy that's like, I can guarantee it 100%.
4247732	4248634	It's going to be there.
4250230	4251010	You know what's going to be there?
4251030	4252891	The Wii U. And my disappointment.
4254011	4255131	Actually, you know what?
4255852	4260713	I'd be interested to see what's going to happen next week during the whole CES stuff.
4261273	4262634	CES is never really gaming.
4263594	4273317	Nintendo is going to be there with the Wii U. Yeah, but they swear up and down it's just the exact same thing they showed at E3 for people who weren't able to wait in that horrifically long line.
4273897	4274937	Yeah, and I don't think they need to.
4275178	4276738	I mean, CES really isn't a gaming show.
4277518	4284181	The biggest game news I can think of that ever came out of CES was the Microsoft Game Room was a big thing that came out.
4284421	4290203	And unfortunately, Microsoft Game Room didn't last, which is such a... Don't get me on that tangent.
4290243	4294904	Game Room had so much freaking potential, and now it's like ruined it for everything else.
4295084	4299646	I'm so mad about Game Room because it could have been so much more awesome.
4300526	4301186	It really should have been.
4301266	4301627	But anyway.
4301647	4302667	Yeah.
4304329	4307051	No, I think the big thing is Windows 8.
4308171	4311633	You'll see more stuff about PC and bigger TVs and 3D TVs and all that.
4312274	4313775	I don't think it's a lot about gaming consoles.
4314195	4322060	You might see little things, especially from Microsoft and the 360 because they're really trying to make the 360 this whole centerpiece.
4322380	4324241	I think they're going to be showing off some new channels.
4325341	4329124	And if you want to take a total shot in the dark...
4329844	4334486	Maybe something akin to the 1 versus 100 thing getting announced.
4334926	4337326	Some type of entertainment channel.
4337346	4338787	So how are you digging those channels?
4338827	4342848	Because I've stopped downloading them because I just don't give a shit about them anymore.
4343768	4345449	They're kind of pointless, I hate to say it.
4345529	4350231	The only one I could ever see myself using is that maybe I would use iHeartRadio if I was hosting a party.
4350571	4353151	Because there are some decent stations on there with very few commercials.
4353332	4354612	Some of the HD simulcasts.
4355132	4365062	you know that play like dance music or comedy on loop it's kind of like having the satellite radio that's the one that I'm kind of like I could see myself using this but the rest not really
4366952	4368493	I don't know.
4368633	4370455	I don't like the new interface, to be honest.
4371115	4375358	Oh yeah, I hate the interface, but that doesn't mean I don't like the point of some of the channels.
4375398	4376699	And the Netflix channel, certainly.
4377180	4379241	Although, actually, I find it better on my PS3.
4379261	4385586	Don't you think now that we have the technology where we could, I don't know, select the interface we want?
4387027	4387327	Thought?
4387527	4387787	Maybe?
4388027	4389288	That'd be nice.
4389368	4391290	We have the technology, we can select it.
4392105	4412479	Alright, well speaking of rumors, there are some rumors about the Really good Fleetwood Mac album There are some rumors about the Xbox Lube, because remember that's what we're calling it now If you don't know why we're calling the new Xbox system the Xbox Lube, you have to go back and listen to some old episodes But apparently the Xbox Lube is supposed to be, this sounds really slick, supposed to be a DVR as well
4414608	4426076	This is according to some patents that are floating around out there that apparently on December 27th the US Patent Office gave Microsoft a patent for a device that would be a game console and a DVR.
4426736	4433241	A digital video recorder application running alongside a television client component allows users to record media content on the gaming console.
4433621	4436743	The DVR application also integrates itself with the console menu.
4437223	4439884	Once integrated, users can record media content while playing games.
4440024	4443486	Alternatively, users can record content when the gaming console is turned off.
4443867	4451211	The recorded content can include television programming, gaming experience, whether local or online, music, DVDs, and so on.
4451631	4457654	When in the recording state, users can also switch between various other media modes, whether gaming, television, and so on.
4457894	4465201	I think this would be more something that would be integrated into a television set or integrated into a set-top box that would be from a cable provider.
4465802	4466743	Here's my other thing.
4466843	4472168	I mean, although I could certainly see this being feasible for the next system, why does it have to be the next system?
4473750	4476973	Isn't it feasible that they could release a 360 that has a DVR built in?
4477801	4483244	They could do that, but I mean, I think that by saying it's in their next thing, that makes it a selling point.
4483944	4484545	True, true.
4484585	4489047	I mean, it is kind of a big thing, but that's the type of thing.
4489087	4490848	Really, how well did the HD clear?
4491068	4493369	Hypothetically, let's say it was in the 360.
4493429	4495990	That I could see coming out of CES.
4497571	4498712	I think DarkSakura is right.
4498752	4500193	I think it's going to be the next system.
4500433	4502974	I'm telling you, it's never going to happen on its own.
4503074	4505695	It's going to be something from a cable provider.
4505915	4513179	The cable providers are going to be like, hey, we're providing content to you and you're going to offer a DVR so now we can't charge people the fee that costs...
4513579	4520960	to rent the DVR system out, you know, and they don't have to buy our higher tier programs to get a DVR.
4521220	4522561	You're gonna pull this shit on us?
4522781	4524141	Fuck that, we want some of that money.
4524481	4525381	So that's not gonna happen.
4525421	4531942	They're gonna put that shit out themselves and it's gonna be kind of like, hey, you can get Comcast and you get a game player as well.
4532382	4535603	You know, a Comcast box and you get games and you can do all this stuff.
4535903	4538683	Or it's gonna be integrated into a TV, you know, something like that.
4538703	4540924	Because I'm telling you, they're not gonna...
4542285	4543306	I mean, I would love it.
4543426	4549914	It'd be great if we could have a DVR because then I can DVR shit without having to pay my cable writer to do it.
4550375	4552157	But I just don't see that happening.
4552197	4553098	It's kind of a pipe dream.
4554239	4558905	I mean, there's DivX, or not DivX, there's TiVo, but who the fuck uses TiVo anymore?
4560226	4574262	uh yeah you got some support in chat room Loki a lot of folks uh agree with you Derek H says Loki is correct I think he's saying it about this I don't know because of the delay there's like a minute delay but uh Ranma in the chat says the console as a DVR will cause a problem because cable providers will not support it
4575535	4575815	You're right.
4575835	4579356	There are cable providers in agreement with Xbox.
4579816	4582817	Comcast, our local one, is supposed to come on board in early 2012.
4582877	4586457	That will be shown at CES for sure.
4586657	4589738	If I can DVR whatever.
4589838	4593039	I can DVR X show or whatever.
4593139	4596139	Let's just say I can set it up like a TV.
4596179	4596679	I can set it up.
4596739	4597900	Okay, I want to record a season of this.
4598380	4600320	Why would I buy the content off of their service?
4601100	4603281	Because I already DVR'd it.
4603321	4604401	They're losing sales that way.
4604701	4604781	Then
4604841	4606022	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4633698	4636842	It's gotta be something that's coming from them, like a new set-top box.
4636902	4638944	What if it just worked with an over-the-air TV, though?
4639044	4643369	I mean, remember, you can hook an antenna to your TV and get these magical channels that come through.
4643390	4644811	Yeah, and it works fantastic.
4645372	4646994	I can tune in zero channels.
4647074	4648756	It depends on where you live and your connection.
4650488	4651028	It's terrible.
4651068	4655211	I need like a big old retro antenna to get out of my roof in order to get that shit to work.
4655251	4656512	No, they don't look like that anymore.
4656612	4657593	Now they're like square.
4657673	4658814	They're totally different.
4658854	4659134	They suck.
4659554	4660295	They suck ass.
4660335	4662877	I mean, seriously, I tried hooking one up too.
4663257	4665098	I was like, yeah, I'm going to put this up.
4665118	4666980	I'm going to get on my HDTV for free.
4667340	4668601	It worked like crap.
4669061	4669782	I got nothing.
4670182	4673084	Not even a Spanish channel that came in correctly.
4673645	4677547	Although when I was programming, it actually got worse every time I tried to find stations.
4678761	4682802	I actually have to say, to be perfectly honest, I have no use for DVR.
4683562	4684303	I don't watch TV.
4684703	4685523	Dan doesn't watch TV.
4685563	4686983	Everything that we watch is streamed.
4687664	4689444	I was going to say BBC America, maybe?
4690244	4691325	Supernatural on CW?
4691505	4694445	I download my shows on the internet because I hate commercials.
4695606	4699507	And besides that, you know... But commercials are what provide your free television.
4700282	4709510	I don't watch the TV I mean, Dan, the only shows that he watches is like Sons of Anarchy and Top Gear and guess what?
4709770	4711091	He streams them from other places
4712489	4714089	We're paying for cable.
4714129	4715049	We rarely use it.
4715110	4718210	We actually downgraded our TV cable and upgraded our internet cable.
4718510	4722771	See, I'm thinking about it, but then that'll be when the next season of RuPaul's Drag Race starts.
4722911	4723971	It's like, I gotta have logo.
4724151	4725211	I can't wait till the next day.
4725911	4726452	Gotta have it.
4727392	4729072	I cannot sashay away my cable.
4729092	4739114	The other thing, too, about CW shows, Rob, is that by the time it airs at its normal time, someone's already uploaded it from the East Coast showing.
4740214	4740955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4766769	4775115	Basically, they're trying not to rely on LittleBigPlanet as their primary safety net, if you will.
4776096	4781659	They are trying to actually expand into different audiences.
4781699	4785482	So they've been spending about... And this is from a British news source.
4785862	4787983	They're spending about 3.44 million pounds...
4792426	4792667	and so on.
4810480	4817644	I think it's really smart too because, you know, say that you've got a company that's good for just one thing and that's all they've been doing.
4818044	4820346	But after a while, the franchise is stale.
4820626	4827570	Because I honestly think LittleBigPlanet, before too long, is going to hit that place where people are going to expect the same thing.
4828190	4830551	And there's not going to be able to put much new into it.
4831732	4836094	I think a big problem is LittleBigPlanet is really a limitless game.
4836234	4840255	There's so much you can do with it, but I think it's the saturation that's going to be an issue.
4840715	4847138	And that's not really on Media Molecule, but it's like you have your PSP version and your Vita version and it's coming out on everything.
4847605	4848646	Well, here's a quote on here.
4848726	4865480	They say that their investments are going into, and this is the quote, leading edge physics and dynamics, rapid world creation from laser data, innovative routes to marketing, to market via web-based interfaces, 3D stereo optics for advanced simulation, and use of high-def data capture and processing techniques.
4866547	4869330	They're making the holodeck, basically.
4869350	4871874	They're making the PlayStation holodeck.
4883007	4897851	They're trying to make it where I think it's not just they're extending to Immerse but they're actually trying to draw in your feedback into the game to make it customizable into whatever they're working on.
4897891	4902252	Derek H in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says 1.5 million to find new games?
4902332	4904052	Come on, that's just another way to write hookers and blow.
4905723	4906303	I don't think so.
4906443	4908144	Perhaps.
4908464	4909945	I would buy a game called Hookers and Blow.
4911785	4915607	Especially if it's that whole 3D immersive experience.
4915647	4920648	You see her nose that's about to snort the cocaine just jumping right out of the TV.
4921008	4921729	I want Man Horse.
4923629	4924990	Then you need to play Saints Row the Third.
4925350	4925610	All right.
4925931	4929553	Well, if somebody would lend it to me, I could play it.
4929593	4930334	I'm just lazy.
4930774	4933996	Let's move on and travel the world with some release dates.
4934317	4936598	And Loki, start us off with the U.S.
4936638	4939580	Although, like last week, there was literally nothing.
4939661	4941242	So I don't know if this week's the same thing.
4941422	4944264	Yeah, there's pretty much nothing.
4945064	4947186	This week, there is...
4949887	4952028	Well, not much.
4952768	4956290	I believe My Pet Puppy 3D from Five by Five Games.
4956390	4957790	I want to say that that got delayed.
4958530	4959991	I can't honestly... Well, here.
4960151	4961171	My Pet Puppy!
4961191	4961992	No, no, no, no, no.
4962472	4964292	I will get you the definitive list here.
4964833	4965153	Okay.
4966133	4984318	but yeah I seriously it was like nothing I think was actually this week we had like three re-releases of some UMD games that were from well that was actually like this week but let's see coming out this week
4988849	4989329	Ah, yes.
4989970	4991050	There is pretty much nothing.
4991330	4994672	So, let's start off with 4-in-1 Action Pack from South Peak Games.
4994732	5005857	It's four games that were featured on the PlayStation Network, and they're all terrible, including Mushroom Wars, Digger, Wave... Was it...
5008087	5012948	Smash Cars, and Wakeboarding HD.
5014008	5014288	All for $20.
5016028	5018369	So, I mean, that's pretty good, right?
5018449	5022850	National Geographic Challenge for PlayStation 3 as well this week.
5023590	5024350	And that is it.
5024670	5026930	Those are the two games you can expect this week.
5028551	5031711	Except, I bet you anything, 4-in-1 Action Pack doesn't come out this week.
5032851	5033732	So maybe one game.
5033992	5034572	That's all you get.
5035052	5035852	And they're all terrible?
5037166	5040149	Uh, yeah, well, I mean, I don't know if they're absolutely terrible.
5040169	5041290	I'm looking forward to Mushroom Wars.
5041370	5047955	Because they're, for five bucks, I mean, for five bucks a game, I mean, that's not bad.
5048176	5049617	I mean, I would think this is...
5050461	5052061	No one's looking for this game, seriously.
5052122	5055142	So instead of being diarrhea, it's just solid poop.
5055222	5056223	Oh, stop.
5056703	5058944	All right, let's move to the Japanese release date.
5059104	5062325	There's at least a couple things this week in Japan.
5062825	5065766	On the PlayStation 3, there's a game called Time Leap coming out.
5066166	5067446	I'm not sure what Time Leap is.
5067506	5072247	Of course, I want to think Time Crisis, but it's actually... Time Leap is a romance dating game.
5072968	5074428	Yeah, I've played one of those.
5074628	5077209	Really, it animates the characters in real time.
5078218	5078978	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5103490	5106295	PSP Super Robot Taisen OG Saga
5114918	5122044	You know, when I hear OG Saga, I'm thinking like, you know, some old school rapper or something like that.
5122164	5123785	The 50 cent games are huge in Japan, go figure.
5123845	5126607	It's like Snoop Dogg in a fucking mech, that'd be awesome.
5126708	5130811	Alright, Nintendo 3DS gets Ace Combat 3D Cross Rumble.
5130891	5132032	I know there's some Ace Combat fans.
5132412	5135615	The Adventures of Tintin the game gets its Japanese release this week.
5136776	5138597	And I think that's it.
5138938	5141280	Nothing on the old school DS or anything else.
5141380	5143021	So a slow week in Japan.
5143221	5143782	Yay.
5143902	5146164	How about the UK?
5147085	5148466	We have some stuff on the 10th.
5148806	5149987	Gotham City Imposters.
5150407	5151669	On the 11th, we have Amy.
5154811	5155752	That game was delayed.
5156192	5158173	It was delayed at the last minute.
5158333	5162355	So it might not show on the calendar you're using, but Gotham City Impostors was delayed to February.
5162375	5163516	Good, because it looks like poop.
5163616	5164717	I remember reading a story on it.
5164757	5165857	It doesn't look like poop.
5165937	5168319	It just looks like Team Fortress 2 with Batman.
5168339	5170420	She got on here last week and talked about how horrible it looks.
5172153	5195571	On the 11th is Amy for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and Choplifter HD for Xbox 360, PC, PlayStation 3 Choplifter HD is so awesome, it has a Duke Nukem cameo Nice Because everyone cares about Duke Nukem nowadays On January 13th is Crushed on the 3DS, or maybe Crushed 3D It's Crushed, but they put the 3 and D in there, so you can kind of go
5196759	5198921	So it's Crushed.
5199301	5204044	I mean it's Crushed.
5204605	5205586	Crushed 3Ds.
5207647	5208047	I don't care.
5208468	5208728	Done.
5209488	5212551	Our release dates have been crushed.
5213071	5216093	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5216113	5219976	You know what, we kind of sounded like, what was that anime club thing on Saturday Night Live?
5221121	5222181	I didn't even watch that.
5222902	5224162	I watched it because of John.
5224442	5227164	And I was like, you know what was sad is that I know people like that.
5227384	5228264	All right, Loki.
5230025	5234026	So there's going to be some changes coming to Xbox Live Indie Games.
5235627	5240129	This includes that they've now allowed people to, you know,
5240869	5241389	Thanks for watching!
5270318	5277823	Um, and then, of course, they've also raised the number of caps of titles that any developers allowed to host on Xbox Live Indie Games.
5278444	5281906	Uh, originally it was 10, now they can have a total of 20 games at a time.
5282927	5285688	Um, so, neat, I guess.
5286189	5291752	Of course, none of the changes that they made have made it easier to find Xbox Live Indie Games on the actual service, so...
5292933	5293473	That's too bad.
5293513	5304736	We'll be posting lots of direct links when Bungie Ferret Tossing comes out, which now with the expanded space, I'm expecting Aaron to include video clips of ferrets and clips from our show.
5304836	5305397	No, I'm just kidding.
5305537	5306257	He can do whatever he wants.
5306277	5308457	Seriously, you need to get some of that ferret B-roll.
5311418	5315960	You need to be able to put in the Konami code and just get actual videos of ferrets.
5316620	5317360	It would be great.
5319431	5322114	I was suggesting from the kitchen that it be played backwards.
5339013	5342154	All right, one other story for you guys before the Classic Game of the Week.
5342174	5348017	We were talking about the Vita a minute ago, and oh, you know the old saying on this show, hackers gonna hack.
5348317	5352539	So how long did it take the... Did Sony ever claim that the Vita was unhackable?
5352719	5353540	Was that claim ever made?
5353580	5354700	I don't think they did this time.
5354880	5356281	No, I think that they just assumed.
5356581	5357801	Yeah, well, it's been done.
5358022	5363004	The Vita's already been hacked, and the first thing that's been running on it, Genesis Games.
5363544	5364385	Yay!
5364405	5365485	And not Linux.
5365725	5366286	Not a bad idea.
5366706	5369347	Sonic and Knuckle, why are you cheering not Linux?
5370808	5373010	Because I'm kind of getting... I see.
5373050	5375031	The quintessential thing is to install Linux.
5375231	5375491	Yes.
5376472	5378033	When you hack the system, you put Linux on it.
5378073	5379713	Write your Hello World program.
5379774	5381535	I'm sure someone did that, but...
5382415	5387680	This is something that people want to download and use a lot of is the Genesis games on the PlayStation Vita.
5388060	5391604	Sonic & Knuckles now apparently running on the PlayStation Vita.
5391664	5392745	It's been out less than a month.
5393265	5398750	Apparently, it's a homebrew Genesis emulator that was originally built for the PSP.
5399311	5401393	It's running on the Vita's PSP emulator.
5401753	5402413	Yes, that's right.
5402454	5407919	It's an emulator emulating an emulator emulating a Sega.
5408619	5424147	Blast Processing And I've gone cross-eyed So there you go Sony apparently has put in some security that is going to make that exploit moot as soon as it is made available according to the video's uploader but how long is that going to last?
5424688	5430331	Watch the PSP They patch, new exploit They patch, new exploit Watch the Wii They patch, new exploit
5431448	5432469	They patch, new exploit.
5432689	5434231	And then they just forget the patch.
5434931	5436233	And the cycle continues.
5436293	5437674	And at some point they just say, fuck it.
5438695	5438995	Alright.
5439576	5443820	Remember back in the day when you didn't hack your system because you were playing a Genesis?
5443980	5445581	If I hacked it, I used an axe.
5446743	5450666	Remember when you actually were playing Sonic & Knuckles on an actual Genesis?
5451027	5452108	What, like two weeks ago?
5453289	5454750	So do we here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5455851	5458193	DarkSakura, what should the kiddies be playing this week?
5475362	5477564	In America, it was known as Rastan.
5478905	5482207	In Japan and England, it was called Rastan Saga.
5483428	5484529	It was put up by Taito.
5484989	5487451	And he played a barbarian beating shit up.
5487711	5488932	Let's have some of that music, Rob.
5489472	5490653	Roll that beautiful bean footage.
5495117	5505524	I've been hearing this game music play endlessly because Dan has decided he's on a Rastan kick and has been watching video playthroughs of Rastan.
5505564	5508365	Let me turn down the audio there so we can hear you.
5509046	5510367	God, so much Rastan.
5511815	5514896	Anyway, so it's sort of inspired by Greek mythology.
5515257	5522720	So you've got monsters coming out and you have to beat them up with your sword or an axe or hammers.
5524041	5526762	Some of the weapons are also jewels and you get shields and mantles.
5527102	5528303	You also can get a goat's head.
5529063	5530604	I think it gives you a one-up or something.
5531444	5532865	Was it an advertisement for God of War?
5533865	5535106	Maybe like seeing into the future?
5536667	5537087	Gee, Robb.
5538258	5549461	Anyway, as far as the background graphics for the arcade version, you actually had sunlight effects and it was fairly innovative for its time.
5549721	5551762	Look at the background on that video for a minute.
5552302	5555943	And make sure that you send a link to Ranma for our Tumblr.
5556683	5559164	Oh, I forgot Ranma was queen of the Tumblr now.
5559364	5559644	Yes.
5560424	5561885	Congratulations on your promotion, Ranma.
5561905	5565286	Because I have a hard time hitting the Tumblr on my little dinky netbook.
5567190	5568871	Oh, all our listeners, get Jamie Laptop.
5569011	5569411	I'm kidding.
5569851	5570331	No, no, no, no.
5570351	5572872	You can use that guy, that rock over there that Alan was using last week.
5572892	5573272	That's okay.
5573312	5573933	I want a new one.
5575493	5584337	Anyway, with the Japanese version actually did get a full dedicated cabinet, but the North American and European ones never did.
5584737	5585817	Theirs were kit conversions.
5586257	5589959	So you could convert an existing cabinet to whatever the kit was.
5590339	5593240	You had new buttons, joysticks, decals, marquees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5594140	5594200	Um...
5596561	5606611	Also, the opening to the story, as what's on this particular version, it was not included in any version but the Japanese version.
5607172	5611636	So, here, sort of in a nutshell, and I'm just going to read from the article here.
5612157	5618283	The game explains that he would be given all the treasures of an empire in exchange for a terrible dragon's head.
5619544	5627994	And when you beat a stage, or the rounds as they're called, you actually get a victory screen that goes with the storyline.
5629115	5637445	In the American version, there's just sort of the generic story, you were a warrior, you cleared this crap, hooray for you, here's some money, and some bitches.
5639754	5643738	It kind of, the opening scene, I have to say, makes me think of Conan.
5644398	5648742	You know, the end of the movie when he's sitting on his throne, but that is another story.
5648763	5650404	Well, he also just looks like Conan.
5650544	5652826	Yeah, I mean, but, you know, this was the 80s.
5652886	5655349	The whole barbarian thing was totally rocking on, you know.
5656229	5661374	And I believe that this came out in, I want to say, 87?
5663176	5663957	Don't quote me yet.
5664917	5671844	As far as the ports that came out, there's a Sega Master System version, which I've got.
5672625	5675308	It actually had decent music, believe it or not.
5675408	5677310	The Master System had pretty decent music.
5678070	5681394	There's an MSX version, a Game Gear version in 91.
5681934	5684657	Oh, for the record, the Master System and MSX versions came out in 88.
5687079	5697608	There was a PC one in 1990, Commodore 64 version in 1987, a Spectrum version in 87, CPC version in 88, an Apple IIGS in 1990.
5698409	5702552	And the Commodore 64 version of the game was impossible to finish, Rob.
5704234	5705174	How did they manage that?
5705315	5706135	Had a bug in the game.
5706536	5706896	Yikes.
5706916	5711260	The bug would prevent a player from making a particular jump from one platform to the other.
5711300	5712401	He would always fall short.
5712721	5713822	He could never make it across.
5714594	5715495	I don't remember that.
5715555	5722159	I mean, I didn't play this game on 64, but that's gotta be irritating, to say the least.
5722500	5730545	Well, for anyone who wants to play it now, it was included in Taito Legends for the PS2 and Xbox and PC in 2006.
5731366	5733147	Which, funny enough, is how I've played this game.
5733207	5735329	I do have Taito Legends, so...
5736468	5737228	Didn't you get it for free?
5738629	5738849	No.
5738869	5739309	I think you won it.
5739329	5745231	No, that was... No, that was the year that you bought it when the Taito thing was going on at Classic Gaming Expo.
5745251	5748052	You're thinking Classic Gaming Expo was the Midway Arcade Treasures.
5748072	5748472	That was it.
5748552	5750853	Because I batted my eyes and I flirted with the Midway lady.
5751293	5751633	Yeah.
5753294	5755034	Okay, so anyway... Who was very nice.
5755074	5756575	I'm very sad to see the Midways no more.
5757745	5758686	Well, there were two sequels.
5759527	5766633	There was a game called Rastan Saga 2 that came out as Nastar in Europe and Nastar Warrior in North America.
5767153	5769716	And then Warrior Blade Rastan Saga Episode 3.
5771597	5780726	There was a 3D fighting game that was put out by Titus Software for PS2 and Nintendo GameCube that was called Barbarian in the U.S.,
5781866	5787847	The game was licensed by Taito and called Warrior Blade Rastan vs. Barbarian when it came out in Japan.
5789107	5790848	It also did come out in Europe later.
5793048	5795309	It didn't really have Rastan in it though.
5795729	5797029	It wasn't really related to the universe.
5797149	5799949	It was just, oh we can put Rastan on this and it will sell.
5801530	5807851	And he also made, the character Rastan made an appearance in a Taito game called Champion Wrestler as Miracle Rastan.
5809452	5813802	And now this game, it came into some censorship issues.
5814804	5823727	That while it wasn't really that adult content, it had blood splattered effects when you beat things.
5823827	5825088	Yeah, spread pixels.
5826208	5827769	Yeah, no, right.
5828469	5833691	And in the Sega Master System support, it actually had some boobage in it.
5834471	5839393	The Gorgon and Harpies were very booby and puby.
5840574	5840734	Yeah.
5841494	5866856	and the Medusa itself is actually just is all boobies so but I mean that was before we had the ESRB so probably today it might have had an M rating how about that but no we got boobs in the 80s and that's it alright there it is your classic game of the week Rastan
5868112	5869474	Polish Chocolate Cake Chocolate Babka
5888357	5888757	Awesome.
5889238	5889738	It's Jewish.
5890279	5890539	Eat it.
5891039	5891359	All right.
5891439	5892120	I'll have a little bit.
5892340	5893021	It sounds delish.
5893681	5893961	All right.
5894001	5896403	So while we feast on cake, we're going to take a break here.
5896763	5897644	But don't go anywhere.
5897664	5899245	There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5899345	5910374	Lots more news still in Part B. Your emails, your tweets, if you tweet us right now at twitter.com slash OLR, your phone calls, and so much more when we come back on the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
5916624	5919326	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5919386	5931295	We are live with this episode number 340, no, not 300, 441 for January the 8th of 2012, the whole new year here.
5932395	5938460	We are live, of course, talking about video games, gaming lifestyle, all that stuff with you guys in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
5938820	5939201	DarkSakura.com
5954898	5983252	or what have you and we played some music from OC Remix during the break I don't usually talk about this on the podcast but I had so many live people asking what those songs were and the fact that you can go to OC Remix and just download these for yourselves I'll go ahead and tell you what it was that first song was Will Rock was the artist from Mega Man 3 it was called Magnetic Fireworks and the second song we played there was a remix from the Goonies 2 password music screen believe it or not but I like that mix a lot that was TJ Neko with two K's N-E-K-K-O with I'm Taking It All Back
5983772	6002328	was the name of that so those are the two songs from OC Remix we played so if you want podcast listeners what you could do is you stop right when you hear the music interlude go listen to those two songs then come back and it's like you were listening live but you know obviously for copyright reasons and so forth even though those songs are free to download on OC Remix it just isn't right for us to put them into our own darn show
6003604	6010689	We're going to be getting into some rapid-fire news here in a minute, but first, I thought I would talk Disneyland, because, you know, I went to Disneyland this week.
6010989	6013371	I didn't miss any shows because of it, because we went in the middle of the week.
6013671	6014972	I've had, like, 18 days off of work.
6014992	6015812	It's been the best thing ever.
6016613	6017574	I sat on your cat.
6017874	6022117	Yes, so DarkSakura was cat-sitting, which, of course, we're incredibly thankful for.
6023217	6025319	And we, well, we took some pictures.
6025539	6026199	We took some pictures.
6027280	6030983	They actually had the Tron bike out at Electronica, so I was able to get that.
6031763	6032724	Is Electronica open again?
6032964	6034185	Electronica was open during the week.
6034726	6035306	Go figure.
6035426	6036147	I don't think it will be.
6036547	6040510	It was the most crowded I have ever seen Disneyland this week.
6040550	6042051	If I get to go to the bonus day thing.
6042171	6043012	Oh, the February 29th thing?
6043132	6043372	Yeah.
6043893	6044213	I don't know.
6044233	6045034	You better have Electronica.
6045054	6047596	That's Disneyland, not California Ventures.
6047616	6048556	I don't know if they're going to do it.
6049077	6049998	I think it's just weekends.
6050258	6054101	And yeah, they're definitely replacing Electronica come spring.
6054381	6059683	But you were looking at the pictures and DarkSakura was commenting that she really enjoyed the picture of Alan and I with Duffy.
6060023	6061864	Because Duffy's your favorite Disney character.
6062424	6063884	Why is Duffy your favorite Disney character?
6064004	6064805	He's fucking cute.
6067465	6069226	For those who don't know who Duffy is, who is Duffy?
6069386	6072487	Dan calls Duffy a focus market bear.
6073267	6074108	He's like, okay.
6074468	6076729	He was created at Hong Kong Disney.
6076749	6077889	Okay.
6080225	6081266	Okay, I was chewing.
6081306	6082287	I was in the mouth of cake.
6083408	6087213	So anyway, it was made by Hong Kong Disney.
6087953	6089815	And he really picked up big in Japan.
6090796	6092438	As, you know... Ah!
6092498	6093099	Duffy Pin!
6094221	6096843	We got Jamie a pin and we got her a Duffy sticker.
6096883	6098023	I actually don't think I have that pin.
6098744	6099044	Nice.
6099424	6099845	There you go.
6100625	6107349	So, but Duffy's just like this cute little bear that Minnie made for Mickey so that he would always have a companion when he went on his travels.
6107429	6109611	Now, you don't have a Duffy bear yet though, right?
6109771	6111852	I have a purse and I have a tiny Duffy.
6111872	6113253	You don't have the actual Duffy bear?
6114033	6114213	No.
6114494	6116555	Well, what if I told you right behind you...
6123464	6123947	I love you.
6124791	6125334	That's mine.
6125394	6125897	Leave it alone.
6126178	6126701	Just kidding.
6126721	6127646	Of course we got that for you.
6129045	6130226	You're welcome.
6130426	6136329	You do cat sit for us and feed the kitties and give them pettings and drink our juice and eat our food.
6136349	6136929	No, I'm just kidding.
6137889	6138590	We do appreciate it.
6138690	6140251	I have a Duffy.
6140291	6143392	So finally this time we said, let's just get her the damn real Duffy.
6143572	6144152	Let's just do it.
6144192	6148334	I have a Duffy hat and a Duffy purse and a teeny tiny Duffy.
6148815	6151936	Dan said he would never buy me anything Duffy and he got me a keychain.
6152176	6152476	Did he?
6153317	6154818	And now I have a real Duffy.
6154918	6155958	He's so soft.
6156158	6157339	Dan's going to be thrilled.
6157839	6159180	I'm taking a picture of him right now.
6159320	6160780	All right.
6161521	6162501	I hope Dan's not listening.
6162521	6163141	All right.
6163742	6164362	I hope he is.
6164802	6168344	TigerClaw in chat says, Rob, you go to Disneyland so much, you will need to go to Disney World.
6168424	6171525	After that, you should take it to the extreme and go to Euro Disney.
6172306	6176968	I would actually love to, or it's Disneyland Paris now, by the way, but I would actually love to go to Disney World.
6177008	6186532	It's just, it's a little more expensive to go cross country and you have to go just the right time of year because I don't want it to be super crowded, but I don't want to get blown away by the hurricane either.
6186872	6191038	And now I'm putting it up on the, uh, on the Orange Lounge picture thingy.
6191278	6193241	Spazinator, that's not a Duffy beer.
6193882	6194783	It's a Duffy bear.
6194803	6195584	It's a big difference.
6196245	6196465	Alright.
6196485	6203335	Okay, the pictures going up on are, uh... Sorry, Loki, I know you really want a Duffy bear more than anything, but maybe next time.
6204175	6205897	I don't even know what the fuck a Duffy bear is.
6205957	6206497	It's this!
6206577	6207979	Okay, I see that's a bear.
6208119	6209080	He's adorable!
6209680	6210461	I don't know who he is.
6210861	6212143	Look, his little feetsies have Mickey.
6212163	6212823	I'm taking a picture.
6212903	6214225	Oh, I was about to take a picture of his feet.
6214745	6218549	Well, Minnie made this for Mickey, so yeah, that's fantastic.
6220035	6223897	I was just buying time for Alan to get that out for Jamie.
6224698	6225458	So let's move on.
6225498	6226779	Let's get back into some gaming news.
6227400	6228720	Get into some rapid fire news.
6228940	6230101	Thank you, Alan, for doing that, by the way.
6231162	6232363	Thank you, Alan, for doing that.
6233023	6234604	Let's get back into some gaming news so I can eat some cake.
6235345	6242651	Alright, so the game by Notch, Minicraft, it's the one that he created in 48 hours last year.
6242671	6244852	It's been ported to Android devices.
6245693	6252719	And apparently it's not an official port of the game, but it's been done by a group called Fullstad Consulting.
6253499	6256682	And it has touchscreen controls and all that fun stuff.
6256722	6259664	And apparently, I believe it's free from the Android Marketplace.
6259744	6261766	So go check it out if you're interested in that.
6263167	6263267	Um...
6265030	6270013	I have no idea why people would buy this, but there is a new device called the Retro 2.
6270894	6276517	It's a USB device that allows you to play Super NES and Genesis games in emulators.
6278138	6279079	The actual thing costs $85.
6281500	6286801	But we'll allow you to plug in your controllers and whatnot into it and play it through an emulator.
6287221	6289782	Or you could probably buy a real console for that price.
6290862	6291422	Just saying.
6291582	6296263	I mean, I don't know why you would bother to try to play these through emulators.
6296403	6300604	Just last week we were talking about flea markets and how some of the old systems still work.
6300724	6302685	The Super Nintendo I have over there still works.
6303565	6305465	So, you know, just go get the old console.
6305505	6307006	Seriously, if you're going to spend $85 on something, you can...
6308786	6310268	I got a text from Dan Duffy the focus group bear
6330713	6331814	I just don't know why.
6331874	6334034	But anyway, if you're interested, you can check it out.
6334695	6337416	It's Retrode.com, I believe.
6337616	6341157	Yes, R-E-T-R-O-D-E, if you want to purchase that.
6342397	6344338	And then, of course, Abobo.
6345198	6348300	You may remember him or not from the...
6349700	6351902	Oh, now I can't remember the goddamn name.
6352102	6352923	Double Dragon.
6353083	6359630	Yes, I was like Dragon Age, Dragon War, Dragon Twin, Dragon something.
6359690	6360610	I know it has dragon in it.
6360630	6362392	Isn't Twin Dragons like a plane?
6362472	6364975	No, that's Twin Cobra and that was a helicopter game.
6365015	6365155	Yes.
6366215	6375344	Yes, so, uh, Aboa's Big Adventure is a free-to-play flash game, um, and of course features one of the characters from, uh, Double Dragon.
6375504	6382692	This game reminds me a lot of, um, oh, what was the one that they did for, uh, there was another one.
6383072	6383793	It was, um...
6385534	6386035	I can't remember now.
6386375	6388477	Maybe it's this game actually that I'm thinking of.
6389197	6399585	Anyways, the game will be coming out on January 11th and I guess it's confirmed on the official website of BubblesBigAdventure.com and you can play the game when it comes out.
6399985	6405830	And of course it features a bunch of old NES settings and parodies so it should be fun.
6407779	6409681	All right, moving on to some other rapid-fire news.
6410342	6412124	You know I love this series, Kid Icarus.
6412585	6416689	Of course, there's the new Uprising game that's coming out, what, this quarter at some point, right?
6416709	6417811	Do we have a firm date for that yet?
6417951	6418932	Yeah, it's in March.
6419112	6420193	I just don't remember what date.
6420394	6421295	So at the end of this quarter.
6421355	6424058	But in the meantime, you can play with some fan remakes.
6424138	6427442	There's a fan remake out there called Super Kid Icarus.
6427882	6452597	it's what they're calling a 16-bit remake um but that's a little bit deceptive because basically it's a pc version of Kid Icarus that uses 16-bit style sprites but very clearly a lot of the fonts and things that are used are pc but whatever you can play it in your emulator and it's basically Kid Icarus with souped up graphics and easy mode so if you uh you know Kid Icarus is kind of a fucking hard game so if you want to uh play it a little easier you can do that in this
6452697	6453718	I did play a little bit of it.
6454498	6456960	I wanted to see if there was more than just the first level in there.
6457000	6458541	And yes, I got all the way to the second level.
6458641	6459302	So there you go.
6460863	6462624	Better play it now before Nintendo pulls it down.
6462644	6463245	That's right.
6463285	6465326	You want to do that now before they pull it down.
6465707	6472552	This is interesting because the website that actually has it is home.comcast.net slash tilde super kid Icarus.
6473032	6479076	So enjoy it now before it gets pulled because I'm sure Comcast will get that cease and desist from Nintendo any minute now.
6480117	6481659	Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony of the Goddesses
6499915	6502296	January 10th is the first show in Dallas, Texas.
6502696	6504076	March 14th in Vancouver.
6504176	6507077	March 26th in Seattle, San Francisco on March 28th.
6507517	6508678	Denver on April 7th.
6509118	6511319	April 20th, 21st in Phoenix.
6511699	6512759	Atlanta on May 12th.
6512819	6514740	Montreal on May 31st.
6515260	6516520	Austin on June 22nd.
6516680	6518301	Orlando on July 14th.
6518401	6520942	And Toronto on September 29th.
6521222	6524083	They are saying that there are more tour dates that are planned.
6524423	6526564	Very interesting what's not on the list.
6526924	6527384	SoCal.
6528124	6544117	so it's interesting to see maybe they'll do an LA show possibly an LA show like around E3 who knows but yeah they're going to be playing music from all the different Zelda games so it's not just the new one so if you like live symphony I think you'll enjoy that
6544717	6549261	God of War 4 apparently has been spotted on a composer's resume.
6550362	6553124	It's the first bit of anything God of War 4 that we've seen.
6553164	6557187	It was on the resume of Timothy Williams, who is the God of War series composer.
6557547	6563612	Apparently it's on his resume, but really, is it any fucking surprise that God of War 4 is in the making?
6564552	6565233	I didn't think so.
6565293	6566074	God of 4.
6566234	6566854	God of 4.
6569096	6571218	I think that's what they should actually call it.
6571758	6572218	So there you go.
6572258	6572739	God of 4.
6573299	6574200	All right, Dark Sakura.
6576420	6578421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6603464	6615752	Well, actually, this is specifically new characters leaked for Street Fighter across Tekken, and that is Shalyu and M. Bison, or as he is known overseas, Balrog.
6617153	6619294	or Vega, sorry, Vega, because they switched them around.
6619734	6622875	Balrog is the Vega over here, whatever.
6623955	6624975	Nah, I've gone cross-eyed.
6625735	6629716	So yeah, Xiaolu and M. Bison are involved.
6630357	6636218	As far as rock band news, it's Rob's absolute favorite band ever, Hall & Oates.
6637739	6638059	Kidding.
6638459	6642320	I was going to say, ABBA has an exclusive thing with the SingStar franchise, so it can't be that.
6642640	6646370	There's Holland Oats Pack 01, which has Private Eyes.
6646571	6647493	I can't go for that.
6647654	6648275	And Maneater.
6648456	6649719	I would get Maneater.
6649739	6650742	Private Eyes is awesome.
6652216	6652896	I kind of want this now.
6652916	6655438	Private Eyes is awesome and actually Maneater is pretty awesome too.
6655918	6665704	Every time I think of Paula Notes, I think of Patton Oswalt talking about if they had those surgery shows back in the 80s, people would want to look like Paula Notes.
6667905	6669706	I'm going to look like Steve Guttenberg.
6670166	6672107	I like what Spazinator suggests in chat here.
6672207	6673048	God of Gwar.
6673328	6674189	God of Gwar!
6675770	6676510	That would be awesome.
6676530	6678431	They should have a Gwar mod for God of War.
6678511	6680472	Don't they have Gwar songs in Rock Band?
6680693	6682214	They've got to have something.
6682234	6682934	That would be awesome.
6682954	6683554	There I am.
6684075	6689278	And the last, but not least, House of the Dead 3 and 4 are both coming to PSN.
6690078	6692140	But no typing of the dead, so therefore failure.
6692320	6692780	Guess what?
6692880	6694141	I have two copies of Typing of the Dead.
6694893	6698795	I don't even know where the fuck my Dreamcast keyboard is if I even have one anymore.
6698815	6700456	I have the Dreamcast version and the PC version.
6700476	6701757	You need to have Typing of the Dead day.
6702337	6703198	You know what we need to do?
6703378	6705980	Because Mavis Beacon ain't got shit on Typing of the Dead.
6706000	6706740	You know what we need to do?
6706920	6707120	What?
6707440	6710382	We need to get Jessica, Iguana Girl.
6710402	6711563	Oh, she was really good at that, wasn't she?
6712043	6713884	and we need to have a Typing of the Dead-a-thon.
6713904	6718145	Because when I got my copy, I took it to her apartment.
6719005	6720986	The apartment that she was living in when I met her.
6721806	6724687	And we played Typing of the Dead for like three hours.
6724947	6726688	I bet I know what apartment that was.
6726728	6727428	She lived there forever.
6727468	6729209	The one with several exits.
6729249	6729749	Yes, yes.
6729949	6730749	I remember that one.
6731409	6736271	But the one that I stayed up for three days without sleep making a costume with Evan.
6738041	6738501	Anyway, anyway.
6738541	6738761	Anyway.
6739601	6747043	But yeah, House of the Dead 3 came out in 2002, and House of the Dead 4 has only been in the arcade, so this is an exclusive to PSN.
6747363	6747603	Nice.
6748023	6749204	Now, how about the Silent Hill game?
6749384	6755405	I know a different company, but that Silent Hill arcade game, seriously, why haven't we seen this released somewhere for the home?
6755485	6757326	Because they have a stick up their ass.
6758106	6758826	Oh, oh, okay.
6758906	6759726	That answers everything.
6759926	6766408	And they're currently stuck on it, and the moment that they learn how to stand up without taking the stick up their ass with them...
6767088	6767989	We'll probably see it.
6768890	6772934	I'm having to hide poor Duffy's virgin Disney ears.
6773655	6776258	Is it too much to ask for some... Duffy, come over here.
6776478	6782345	Is it too much to ask for some fucking Silent Hill arcade game?
6782925	6784086	I'm definitely the Disney bear.
6784766	6788349	And I think that Rob has a potty mouth and he should eat some soap.
6788369	6788529	Oh, God.
6789189	6791991	This is just like Lil Santorum on Horde House this week.
6792911	6794112	I'm not even going to explain it.
6794152	6794392	What?
6795093	6796294	I'm not even going to explain it.
6796454	6797334	Horde House dot com.
6797394	6798155	Lil Santorum.
6798175	6798655	Yeah, that's.
6798795	6799476	I could just imagine.
6799696	6802197	Hi, I'm Rick Santorum and I'm an asshole.
6805580	6806100	All right, look.
6807401	6807701	Yeah.
6809637	6811618	For the record, that was an authentic southern accent.
6812658	6813158	Oh, was it?
6814919	6815379	I couldn't tell.
6815539	6817200	Is that DarkSakura or is it George Bush?
6817340	6817900	I'm not sure.
6819701	6820201	Moving on.
6821702	6825963	Loki, maybe you can bring some video game news back into this program that used to be about gaming.
6825984	6827064	Let's talk about piracy.
6828010	6829311	Alright, whatever, I'll take what I can get.
6830572	6835356	So, of course, a report came out talking about the most pirated games of 2011.
6835516	6837258	This is coming from Torrent Freak.
6837318	6839179	I would think that they would know a little bit about piracy.
6840900	6846365	Now, now, Loki, Torrent Freak isn't... It's just a BitTorrent news site.
6847065	6848066	How dare you?
6848086	6852530	Well, they should still be up to date with what's going on, including piracy.
6852590	6853351	I mean, come on.
6854091	6858975	I'm not suggesting that they are pirating themselves or facilitating pirating in any way.
6859536	6862378	I am just saying that they should know something about it.
6862959	6869965	Anyways, the number one game that has been downloaded 3.9 million times since its release in March of 2011
6873852	6877454	Crisis 2, the sequel to the game that killed PCs around the world.
6879335	6881457	But yes, Crisis 2, number one game.
6882137	6888161	Of course, Modern Warfare 3 was downloaded an estimated 3.6 million times since November.
6889442	6892925	So, you know, if Modern Warfare 3 had come out in March, then it would probably have been number one.
6896850	6904479	Battlefield 3 coming in 3rd with 3.5 million downloads and of course, rounding out the top 5, FIFA 12 and Portal 2.
6906901	6907322	There you go.
6908463	6910625	Surprised what's not on the list maybe?
6910746	6911046	Anything?
6913778	6915399	I mean, that was all PC stuff.
6916200	6918362	Let's talk a little bit about... How about Xenoblade?
6919523	6923066	Well... I'm surprised more people didn't pirate that to be able to play it in the US.
6923086	6925629	Now, now, you spoke too soon.
6926349	6932675	The top Wii game downloads on BitTorrent in 2011, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Mario Sports...
6933055	6933315	Mix.
6933395	6935436	Why the fuck would people download Mario Sports Mix?
6935456	6935956	That's a terrible game.
6935976	6936917	That's a very good question.
6936997	6939938	I get Galaxy 2 because that was on a lot of the best list.
6940098	6942339	And Xenoblade Chronicles was number three.
6942459	6944300	Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, number four.
6944700	6946381	And FIFA 12, number five.
6946401	6947642	That's a weird list.
6947922	6948662	Yeah.
6948942	6951003	Xbox 360 downloads.
6951063	6952344	Gears of War 3, number one.
6952404	6954725	Call of Duty Mario Warfare 3, number two.
6954865	6956266	Battlefield 3, number three.
6956666	6958747	Forza Motorsports 4, number four.
6958947	6961128	And Kinect Sports Season 2, number five.
6961847	6962587	Thanks for watching!
6987156	6991977	StarCraft 2, big PC game, nowhere on that list, I think, because of the whole Battle.net tie-in.
6992618	6998519	Of course, that drives a lot of people bonkers because they don't want to be on the internet to play the game, so where's the happy middle ground?
6998539	6998879	I don't know.
6999879	7005081	All right, anyhow, moving on to a system that I'm sure nobody's going to pirate any games on at all, the Wii U.
7007473	7013080	There's a new rumor about the Wii U, because rumors about the Wii U are everywhere, and it's a slow news week, so why the hell not?
7013501	7018126	Apparently, Wii U will also double as an e-reader.
7018767	7024914	This is apparently via a friend who Nintendo approached to do iOS software ports for.
7025254	7039564	over to the Wii U system, which doesn't surprise me at all that the Wii U would probably be going after things like Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Tiny Tower, the stuff that's really big on iOS to be able to be played on the touch device.
7039644	7040644	That wouldn't surprise me at all.
7041805	7049170	But apparently Nintendo is also looking at doing digital books, magazines, comics, and so forth on the Wii U and the 3DS.
7049791	7054714	Apparently instruction manuals could be done this way too, strategy guides, and Nintendo Power.
7055936	7064510	You know what would be really funny, but there's no way this is ever going to happen, is if the Wii U controller actually became its own console.
7065933	7066653	But it can't.
7066933	7069054	I mean, because all the processing is done on that base.
7069074	7069834	I understand that.
7070174	7073475	They could put an ARM processor in there and have its own tablet.
7073535	7075836	Yeah, I'm kind of deja vu-ing what we talked about a little bit last week.
7075856	7087079	But yeah, we talked about how maybe one of the big things that they're going to change, because the system could change a lot until next E3, is that maybe they're going to put its own processor, a littler processor, in the Wii U controller itself.
7087779	7092160	It's going to drive the price of those things up even more, but... Processors are cheap, really.
7092856	7093817	Yeah, I guess it's true.
7093877	7095117	It just depends on what they put in there.
7097839	7100740	DDRDollarBill in our chatroom says, Wii U trying to be a tablet?
7101441	7101901	Yeah.
7102521	7103622	Tablets are terrible!
7104022	7105563	Let's build a tablet, come on.
7105743	7106684	Well, here's the thing, though.
7106724	7111006	I think a lot of it would be the fact that Nintendo would have a big audience with kids.
7111666	7114928	Like, maybe kids are too young to have their own iPad?
7115428	7115668	Rob?
7115949	7116169	What?
7116409	7117750	How well did the Pico do, really?
7118650	7121391	But kids could use the Wii U controller.
7121431	7122432	See, that's the thing, though.
7122552	7124493	I don't think kids are too young to have an iPad.
7124753	7125673	Well, let me put it this way.
7126074	7131336	A lot of parents don't think kids are too young to have an iPad, and they will buy them an iPad or an iPod or something.
7131376	7138800	I mean, I remember seeing on some gaming blogs the stupid iPod touch freak out Christmas videos and stuff like that.
7138960	7139400	I mean, come on.
7139440	7141401	Parents are willing to buy their kids that kind of stuff.
7141541	7143662	There are cat games on iPad.
7144382	7150408	There's games for toddlers on the iPad, so I'm not surprised that they would do that.
7150468	7157974	Seriously, with an iPad 3 coming out probably soon, it's only going to drive the prices of the older models down.
7158374	7162138	So why wouldn't parents buy an iPad?
7162338	7169524	I'm not surprised parents would let their kids play with an iPad because people are letting their frogs and lizards play with their iPad.
7169564	7170585	That Ant Smasher game?
7170805	7171826	Well, people are dumb.
7171986	7173628	It is kind of amusing.
7173668	7179613	Well, as long as the Wii U gets swap note, that's all I care about.
7179653	7183176	Which, by the way, if you could smile big, because I'm going to take a picture for Bobby here.
7183537	7184277	I'm not smiling big.
7184337	7186059	Maybe I'll send it to Tigerclaw 2 there.
7186079	7188241	A little 3D picture there of all our life.
7188301	7188541	All right.
7190632	7191213	with Duffy.
7192635	7194557	Duffy makes every photo adorable.
7195618	7197821	Hey, Swapnote is actually pretty cool.
7198882	7202447	It's like Nintendo is finally understanding email.
7203482	7204283	Fantastic, Nintendo.
7228756	7234082	For the record, I'm putting a picture of Duffy's butt on the OLR thing.
7234903	7239127	OrangeLaunchRadio.com Alright, let's take a moment to visit the mailbag.
7239267	7240689	Every week you guys send us emails.
7242273	7248700	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag and reads her favorite emails.
7248720	7252744	I was going to say we should start taking emails over SwapNote but you'd have to have my friend code to do that.
7253064	7254746	Duffy should start reading them.
7255727	7256628	Hi, I'm Duffy.
7256728	7258089	No, Duffy should not read them.
7259650	7264073	While I work on my swap note, I'm going to send a swap note to Bobby, and I guess I'll send it to Tigerclaw.
7264214	7267016	I don't know who else listens to OLR on my friends list, but I'll send it to them too.
7267136	7273040	Well, I wanted to announce that we do have three winners for the Master System Contest.
7273100	7273540	Wieners?
7274080	7274441	Wieners.
7275041	7279264	That means I have to do... I think I've got games enough to divide amongst them as well.
7280625	7282266	So one is from Will...
7283887	7287189	and I will be logging into the email when I get home.
7288430	7292612	Another one is... Where is it?
7294913	7296254	From Rico.
7297335	7298375	And one of them was Hitstun.
7299896	7303658	So, congratulations to our winners.
7303698	7304959	Congrats to all you wieners.
7305635	7308701	and I'm going to try to send you ones that you don't already have.
7308881	7312288	So I know who's about getting what.
7312328	7315454	And if you get a duplicate, sorry, eBay.
7316596	7318079	We can autograph them though if you want us to.
7319545	7321686	So back to the mailbag.
7322687	7325749	I just played the worst game in history of Nintendo DS.
7326490	7330592	I asked for it for Christmas because I love puss in boots and a sexy Antonio voice.
7331153	7337177	Well, unfortunately, the reviews I were looking at were for the Wii version of the game, which apparently is decent.
7337637	7340819	This, however, this abomination should never have been made.
7341400	7344542	It is surely the spawn of Satan and all copies should be destroyed.
7345322	7354149	Seriously, the graphics look like something back from early, early PlayStation 1 or Nintendo 64 back when their characters, they were made of Lego blocks.
7354669	7357711	No voices, and the gameplay, tap the screen to the beat.
7357972	7359673	No, seriously, that's the whole stupid game.
7360574	7366218	And that's what I get for buying a tie-in game, I guess, but I really thought they'd treat puss with some respect.
7366718	7367279	Sad face.
7367619	7372863	Holly D. Haven't we warned you about tie-ins?
7373484	7375791	That's right, game tie-ins can be pretty bad.
7376473	7379541	Or movie tie-ins, games can be pretty bad.
7380484	7381025	Next email.
7381547	7381928	Bummer, though.
7382830	7383791	Hi, OLR crew.
7384111	7385832	I've never seen The Tester on PSN.
7386092	7389275	Not the first season or the second, mostly because I'm over reality shows.
7389755	7394759	I also thought the grand prize of being an entry-level tester was kind of stupid, though a great way for you to get your foot in the door.
7395399	7400023	But I think I'm going to start watching the new season because I just found out a friend of a friend is a contestant.
7400523	7406227	We were chatting on Facebook and I asked her if she'd be interested in appearing as a guest on OLR, but only if you're interested.
7407208	7413570	She seemed very interested, but would have to get back to me to see if corporate folks would allow her to do so.
7414130	7415651	So my question is, would you be interested?
7417411	7418052	Why the hell not?
7418132	7420352	Sure, I want to know who beat DarkSakura for the position.
7420912	7423573	No, DarkSakura withdrew herself.
7423633	7428695	I'm not going to give any more of her information, just because it's included in the email.
7428715	7429175	Sure, sure.
7429455	7430155	But we are interested.
7430756	7431256	Yeah, why not?
7431856	7434357	If corporate PSN will let us, then we're happy for it.
7435157	7437378	I would love to ask some questions about this stuff.
7437879	7442061	I want to wait until the show debuts, though, so we can be like, okay, how bad did they misrepresent this?
7442101	7446443	Well, there is at least one person that's a somewhat internet celebrity that's actually in there.
7447484	7447784	Oh, really?
7447944	7453787	Yeah, the guy that does, I don't know if you've ever seen them, the awesome games, like Metal Gear Awesome.
7453807	7456649	Oh, those are great.
7456669	7460491	Yeah, he's actually in contention there.
7461371	7462051	That's funny.
7462712	7465372	So, rooting for him, because he's the only person I recognize.
7465832	7466292	Vaguely.
7466973	7471054	Anyway, it says, thanks and keep up the good work, and thanks for putting the podcast up on Mondays.
7471074	7472214	They're not so blah anymore.
7472534	7473254	That's from Stan.
7473434	7475515	I had the show up within an hour last week.
7475715	7476955	This is great having it at my house.
7477315	7478136	Good for you.
7478456	7478996	Just saying.
7479836	7484297	Okay, by the way, I sent that message on SwapNote.
7484878	7486338	See how long it takes to get to Tigercola.
7488485	7491123	This is good evening, DarkSakura, Sky, and LokiSaurus.
7492754	7494856	I am writing to you from a pseudo-email account.
7494996	7497238	For our conversation, you can call me Traxler.
7497678	7498719	I'm a long-time listener.
7498779	7499580	Here is my plight.
7500721	7503523	I am a 34-year-old male gamer living in Northwest Florida.
7504244	7509609	I play everything from Batman Arkham City on Xbox to SWTOR and WoW on PC.
7510309	7513932	I make a decent income from working full-time technical job in a network operations center.
7514693	7519858	I am suffering probably from maybe a newer condition called gamer's loneliness or gamer's depression.
7520798	7544258	I am an okay looking guy, average weight and height, I have money and a car I'm having problems finding a companion, I like women so I'm not alone I've tried POF, OkCupid, Geek2Geek with no success I think it might be my age and the single gamer women are ultra rare Maybe the fact that I don't drink or go to clubs slash bars I do know my schedule is bad, I work Friday to Monday 12 hour shifts with a 2 hour commute to work each day But it's my job
7544958	7545638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7565948	7567129	DarkSakura is married, however.
7584286	7589570	I wanted to let you all know this information because there could be other gamers out there that could be feeling the way I feel.
7590031	7594254	I'm not sure if this is just how the world balances us gamers out of future equations.
7594314	7595155	Reduce population.
7595475	7596676	Your loyal listener, Traxler.
7597017	7599359	This message is brought to you by Shermie Skylander Emporium.
7600600	7601140	Wow!
7601240	7601801	DB Mail.
7601981	7602802	Okay.
7604663	7606705	That threw me for a little bit of a curveball.
7607485	7607505	I...
7609221	7636493	I think it's one of those things where when you kind of let it go that you kind of have all that hanging over your head like oh my god I need this perfect life and I need this companion and I need I need all this to happen ABC to happen so I can be happy no no no you have to learn to be happy with what you've got and you're kind of like your current situation and then once you kind of have that about you that that confidence the rest of it will come I think I think
7636921	7639344	I always say it happens when you stop trying to force it.
7640245	7645790	I mean, yeah, I also say things happen when you make them happen, but that's like stuff that you have tangible control over.
7646351	7651997	You know, like, I can't do this, well then go to school and learn how to do it.
7652237	7653018	You know, that type of thing.
7653619	7654720	In this case, you know...
7656644	7662248	Like with, and I know I've told this story a million times, but Dan and I hooked up, is that we had just been friends.
7663008	7664669	We weren't trying to do anything.
7665490	7671193	And he just called me to cheer me up and we kept talking because it worked.
7671833	7673595	And I moved out here and we worked.
7674455	7679378	You know, that's just, that's like a really rare success story on top of that.
7680018	7682320	You know, it was just sort of a faded thing, I guess.
7683908	7690844	I really think that a good relationship will find you when you're not looking for one.
7691806	7692448	If that makes sense.
7693717	7698441	Alan and I were friends online for probably four or five years via LiveJournal.
7698501	7700662	I'm sure he thought I was attractive.
7700682	7701423	I thought he was attractive.
7701463	7702964	It was kind of like, he lives in San Francisco.
7702984	7704865	It's like he lives in China, so far away.
7705486	7711150	And we never really gave it any thought until one day it just kind of, let's go out sometime.
7711230	7712250	And we did.
7712310	7715152	And then it was kind of like, well, we're going to make this work.
7715192	7715553	And we did.
7715693	7717594	So it just happened.
7717694	7719596	I never thought it would, and it did.
7719776	7719876	Yeah.
7720296	7724417	Although somewhere in the back of my imagination, I imagine Nelly going after Loki with a club.
7726578	7727498	Isn't that what happens actually?
7727518	7728639	Like a cave girl.
7728979	7729499	Eh, no.
7730920	7734881	But, you know, for real, like, I wouldn't, like, just don't stress about it.
7734961	7737982	Like, that's, you're only gonna cause yourself, like, hurt to do that.
7738562	7767758	and I don't think you need to go out to bars or clubs I think you're doing the right thing just kind of put yourself out there online I would say if you really feel like you need to go out and do something try maybe like I know this sounds really weird but try like joining a club or maybe there's a non-profit in your area a political cause you can get behind a volunteer you know something where you force yourself to get out of the house well when I lived in Alabama and keep in mind this is when I was effectively single you know I did a lot of stuff I LARPed
7768436	7770198	Yes, I played live-action vampires.
7770238	7770598	Shut up.
7771679	7772920	There's nothing else to do in Alabama.
7774341	7775503	I was in band.
7776203	7777184	I did jazz band.
7778005	7778906	I was in orchestra.
7779646	7781548	You know, because I was still a big band nerd.
7782529	7785251	I would do ensembles with other friends.
7786072	7787393	I played D&D.
7787513	7790977	Oh god, that was when I was in eight games a week for a while.
7792449	7794529	and I did... There was even... I gamed every night.
7795030	7795390	Every night.
7795450	7796450	I was in different gaming groups.
7797190	7801351	So, I mean... And I even dated a couple of people that I gamed with.
7801931	7816894	Like, there was one guy who I was really into for a while but we just kind of never... Sort of fun to make out with and, you know... Fun to make out with, good friend, you know, never... That's exactly the type of people I met doing Rocky Horror for so many years.
7816914	7818114	Yeah.
7818174	7819315	It's almost the same kind of thing.
7819415	7820755	But, I mean, you know, if...
7822215	7847351	if you're making yourself into some kind of hermit I mean you're not going to meet anybody unless you find ways to branch out you have to make it yourself and so okay so clubs aren't your deal you know what I hate clubs too I sometimes go just because I like booze and I like goth music so I'll go hang out but I don't you know go because I'm well then again I didn't really start clubbing until I moved out here at all
7848209	7855538	But if that's not your thing, then find, you know, I've made friends through my temple, for example, after I converted.
7855638	7858802	And I don't know if you're religious or anything, but, you know, there's always groups.
7858822	7861025	That is something you can do with like-minded people, you know.
7861165	7866131	Or, you know, if, check out, actually check out YMCA.
7866151	7866291	Okay.
7867748	7868870	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7883993	7888535	And coming back to this point, because I think this is very important, I think the first thing you have to do, and then we'll stop the advice show, I promise.
7889076	7892178	But I think the first thing you have to do is you have to really sit down and say, I have a good life.
7892698	7894079	I mean, you do have a job.
7895079	7895399	I don't.
7896680	7900082	Right, but you have a lot of stuff that's going for you right now.
7901723	7928406	you have the things that you're proud of and I don't know this person so it's hard for me to say whatever they are into but there's probably a lot and the person even says his email I consider myself good looking you have a lot going for you then so love yourself find the stuff that makes you happy and focus on that if the games aren't doing it for you anymore then there's another gap distract yourself
7929267	7933069	But I'm not saying distract yourself in a don't work on the problem kind of way.
7934289	7934469	What?
7934930	7935610	I'm sorry.
7935850	7936250	Reading chat.
7936390	7941673	But I was going to say, you know, find new things.
7942333	7945774	You know, if your current hobby is not doing it for you, find a new hobby.
7946715	7949416	But you have to be out there is the thing.
7949536	7952077	If you're going to try to meet somebody, you have to be out there and not be a hermit.
7952998	7954298	Loki, what would be your dating advice?
7954318	7956399	I don't have dating advice.
7956419	7957480	I'm not going to give you any of that.
7959577	7963779	My advice is, hey, you're going to have a lot of... Hookers.
7963999	7964579	Lots of hookers.
7964619	7969561	Sometimes it's actually nice to have a lot of free time to play the games you want to play because you're not going to have that much.
7969581	7971542	Because once you have a baby, that all goes away.
7972022	7972942	It's all gone.
7972962	7975303	That's good advice.
7975703	7976083	You know what?
7976163	7978284	And that's another way to look at it.
7978364	7980505	I'm not saying hate on kids or whatever.
7981446	7983306	But enjoy the life you have while you have it.
7984827	7985047	Right?
7985839	7986479	So, there you go.
7986519	7986699	Anyway.
7986719	7989100	I mean, sometimes, you know, yeah, it's just like, you know.
7989120	7994743	However, if you want to incorporate sex life and your video gaming, you could try J-List because they have lots of imports.
7995463	7999985	Honestly, it's just, go to cons.
8001305	8002526	It's like, seriously.
8002586	8004246	Actually, actually, actually.
8004887	8006047	That's not a bad idea.
8006607	8007028	Why not?
8007308	8007988	Chris and Megzy.
8008666	8009386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8034861	8035561	Hi, OLR.
8036042	8038082	This past week I've been on a nostalgia trip.
8038122	8038703	Did you come back?
8039563	8043665	I ended up digging up my Mega Drive and playing Castle of Illusion and Streets of Rage 2.
8045345	8046766	Now I'm getting all wistful.
8047586	8049307	It said sigh in there, so I actually sighed.
8050127	8058251	On a completely different subject, seeing as DarkSakura has been raving about the game, I just thought I'd point out that Fractal is now available in Indie Royale's New Year's Bundle.
8058471	8060072	That's at IndieRoyale.com.
8060232	8062713	I-N-D-I-E-R-O-Y-A-L-E.com
8063713	8068977	Also, Nintendo seems to be going out of their way to make getting the Circle Pad add-on as awkward as possible.
8069538	8075082	It's being released exclusively through Zavvi, an online-only retailer here in the UK.
8076063	8077644	And that looks like a very unhappy face.
8078325	8079986	Hear you later, Catastrophic Moggy.
8082188	8085150	You know, I love Castle of Illusion and I love Streets of Rage 2.
8086231	8088753	So, I would say, great gaming.
8090191	8095432	I've been actually talking about Fantasy Zone with people and I really need to sit down and hook up the Master System and play some Fantasy Zone.
8101194	8101414	Anyway.
8102594	8103154	Yeah, Fractal.
8103254	8103754	Awesome game.
8103814	8105475	Everyone needs to play it so go get that bundle.
8105875	8108295	Oh yeah, it's in that new bundle.
8108815	8109896	I was thinking about getting that actually.
8109956	8110256	Get it!
8110996	8111876	Alright, damn!
8113894	8118238	Okay, and then someone sent us a video, but I can't watch it on my computer.
8119359	8120820	Sorry, this is just a great comment.
8121101	8123923	Spazinator making a comment on the last email, the dating advice email.
8124344	8125805	He needs a Cupid arrow to the knee.
8128889	8152008	as much as I hate that was pretty good again congratulations to our winners for the three of you that emailed me email me your address and you will get a game in the next couple weeks Master System game at random however I will make every attempt to send you something you don't already have so
8153584	8153824	All right.
8153924	8154966	I texted Dan to remind him.
8154986	8156327	He's like, don't give away my games.
8156387	8158109	I was like, we already talked about this.
8159310	8159551	All right.
8160051	8160892	Stop being so stingy.
8161313	8162013	Is that it for emails?
8162134	8162534	That's it.
8162714	8162974	All right.
8163355	8166358	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have an email for us.
8166498	8167700	I mean, literally, we'll read anything.
8167760	8171724	I mean, that one email was about dating, not even totally about games, but whatever.
8172205	8173046	And guess what?
8173666	8173927	Duffy.
8175308	8176889	Duffy better not send emails to the show.
8177230	8178170	Hi, I'm Duffy.
8178230	8178551	All right.
8179972	8181893	It's time to get into the FUs of the week.
8181973	8183715	Every week we are angsty.
8184235	8184595	Why?
8184855	8185476	Because we can.
8201348	8204951	I'm not at all upset anymore because I have Duffy.
8206385	8206806	The end.
8208488	8208789	Loki!
8209870	8210251	Try Visual Basic.
8218211	8221713	Yeah, but see, I don't want to do Visual Basic, that's why I'm using Excel.
8224015	8226636	Alright, um... I don't know, I'm actually in a pretty good mood.
8226676	8241606	Like, I should be giving an FU to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow after being off for like two and a half weeks, but I'm... Like, seriously, this is the longest vacation I've had since I started working there, which was ten years ago, which didn't involve me being in the hospital or having surgery, or having the swine flu, which happened once.
8242126	8245028	And even when I had the swine flu... I'm still sorry about that, Rob.
8245088	8247550	I was only out for like two weeks, not two and a half, so...
8248070	8251111	But I actually, like, I'm so well rested and feel so good.
8251151	8255213	I'm like, I'm actually, this is weird, looking forward to going back to work.
8255933	8257314	And then reality will set in.
8257754	8260755	So F you to that all messing with my mind.
8260835	8261775	I do, you know what though?
8261895	8262316	I'm lucky.
8262556	8263256	I'm very fortunate.
8263416	8264497	I really do enjoy my job.
8264997	8266799	I teach people for a living.
8267159	8267720	It's a great thing.
8267940	8268580	I love my job.
8268821	8269241	I really do.
8269461	8270582	And they're not small children.
8270702	8277348	It's just sometimes some of the other stuff, everybody gets annoyed with their job at some point.
8277588	8285255	Because any time you put a bunch of personalities together and one's in charge or whatever, things might go, but I have a great boss.
8285355	8285895	I really do.
8286295	8287296	My boss is awesome.
8287537	8288537	We work so well together.
8289599	8300198	I can't really complain so F you to the fact that I don't take two and a half week vacations more often because I really should and F you to the fact that the only way I was able to do it before was getting the swine flu
8302674	8304676	I need to reward myself more often.
8305076	8308378	I'm sorry I gave you swine flu.
8308398	8309639	That's alright.
8309739	8310860	I didn't know I had it.
8310960	8312461	I rubbed AIDS all over the bear.
8312882	8313442	I'm just kidding.
8314723	8315083	Alright.
8316784	8317665	Let's move on.
8318666	8319006	Loki.
8320151	8340995	Alright, so Nintendo, being the forefront of digital and online, they apparently slapped the wrists of the owner-director of Icon Games Entertainment, Richard Hill Whithall.
8342095	8346276	He apparently has released several games in the last year on various platforms.
8347137	8352102	and he recently shared some sales numbers on the website Gamasutra.
8352842	8356686	But then was asked by Nintendo to take down the numbers for its platforms.
8357367	8367597	According to Richard, Nintendo doesn't allow developers to share digital sales numbers for self-published WiiWare and Downloadable DS titles.
8368718	8369759	That's kind of interesting.
8370339	8384407	Apparently, I guess it hurts smaller developers who need to make those sales numbers known in order to secure financing and plan out business models and stuff like that.
8384687	8390470	Apparently, though, you can still kind of figure out his numbers because he gives a total number and the other platforms do the math.
8391286	8392327	I have to do math?
8392948	8397033	And on top of that, the numbers weren't so good on the Nintendo platforms, unfortunately.
8397133	8399876	So maybe that's why they don't want numbers out there.
8400036	8406724	There's a lot of saturation on the Wii marketplace, too, and it's really hard for games to stand out because the Wii store isn't set up very well, you know?
8407244	8411049	Yeah, so... Yeah, apparently that sucks.
8411832	8412092	All right.
8412953	8417756	Well, we talked a little bit earlier in the show, and I know Bobby talked a lot on his show tonight.
8417796	8420999	Of course, Bobby Blackwolf was on before us at All Games Radio, talked a lot about SOPA.
8421439	8427143	And, you know, the Internet's been talking a lot about SOPA, and I'm sure most of you, you know, listening... They're going to scrub it clean of content.
8428304	8436090	Most of you guys who are tech-savvy enough to download this podcast and listen to it and understand it probably already have a general awareness about SOPA.
8436650	8441476	But this is how the message might be communicated to those that don't understand SOPA.
8441616	8442637	I find this very interesting.
8443398	8449805	Apparently, they're talking about a huge, what they call the nuclear option to protest SOPA.
8449845	8454290	And this is rumored to be happening on January 23rd because the Senate is going to debate this on the 24th.
8455131	8458514	AOL, eBay, Facebook, Etsy, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Zynga Game Network
8477991	8483054	And really, I mean, this is just anybody who cares about tech has a vested interest in SOPA.
8483254	8489538	And I think I've made this pretty clear, as has Loki, as has DarkSakura, but OLR is obviously against SOPA.
8489739	8494782	And based on the reason that it gives companies way too much power.
8495542	8501406	I understand that people want to do something about piracy, but there has to be, I think, more accountability in that regard.
8501466	8501526	And
8501966	8505030	Soap is not really going to do anything for some sites.
8505991	8508894	If you know the numbers, you're going to be able to get on the Pirate Bay.
8508914	8509615	I just don't understand.
8509655	8510876	So who does it hurt?
8510976	8511737	I don't understand.
8512057	8520827	It's almost like to me like a really terrible web filter that's at like someone's office or something like that where it's like, oh, I can't go to Facebook.
8521127	8521728	and DarkSakura.com.
8540982	8541763	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
8561482	8563843	Well, then again, we can also detain people for no good reason.
8564743	8568244	Well, you know, that's a whole nother Oprah, or so they say.
8568464	8570404	Yeah, but I think it's all related.
8571464	8574585	It's screwed up how much power companies have in this country.
8575185	8575765	It really is.
8576386	8581647	I don't get political on this show nearly as often as she does, but this is something that really irritates me.
8581667	8587888	And especially when you have all these video game companies where the ESA has stood against it, you know, because, you know, piracy bad.
8588248	8589649	So the ESA stands against it.
8589689	8590969	But most of the gaming companies are like...
8592270	8598253	A lot of the gaming companies were reached out to for comment and basically came back with, we don't really do politics.
8598353	8601815	We just make games so the ESA kind of speaks for us.
8603236	8603416	What?
8604837	8605037	What?
8605857	8606858	Educate yourself.
8607318	8607939	That's fine.
8607979	8610060	If you're going to let someone else speak for you.
8610240	8618104	It's going to be those morons, the people that don't understand why this is very bad, that are going to ruin it.
8618165	8618925	It doesn't really affect
8619405	8622366	I mean, as far as their product goes, it doesn't affect them.
8622386	8637732	The fact that they are these big companies that are going to be able to pull Justin TV feeds and things that might be critical about their game that ought to be legal under fair use when these little reviewers aren't going to be able to fight them, that is, when they don't even fucking understand the law, they just know they can do it.
8638593	8638813	Exactly.
8638833	8639533	That bothers me.
8639593	8640073	Exactly.
8640153	8641134	Why do they care then?
8641154	8641734	That's the point.
8641834	8645696	It's all, well, you're going to give us a bunch of power to take down all these people that we don't like?
8645756	8646056	Sweet.
8646196	8646456	Yeah.
8647219	8648480	Why would I oppose that?
8648960	8655185	But of course they're not going to say, oh, we're strongly for that, because then people backlash against them.
8655225	8660388	So they've got to take the on-the-fence approach, or, oh, we're just hands-off, we'll let them do whatever.
8661049	8662029	That way they can't let...
8663090	8663711	Maintain web silence
8691552	8693474	Can you imagine if you can't use Google for a day?
8693494	8694975	I mean, that's going to piss some people off.
8695195	8696476	But I think some people need to be pissed.
8696556	8697757	I think that's necessary.
8698798	8699738	I think it's necessary.
8699798	8701319	They should all go down.
8703061	8704222	Now, let's see.
8704262	8705343	What did I want to say here?
8705503	8710026	Oh, Frisbee in our chat says, May I suggest these companies use ocean marketing to speak for them?
8710406	8712028	I realize you're making a joke there, but think about it.
8712048	8713609	How did that whole thing really happen?
8713649	8713769	Yeah.
8715350	8719174	The guy represented himself as something he kind of wasn't, right?
8720175	8720435	Anyway.
8723217	8731405	TigerClaw says, I recall years ago, Take-Two sent DMCA notices to several Justin TV channels that were showing GTA 4 when it first came out.
8731766	8734268	I believe this is because they didn't want spoilers being leaked.
8735643	8736323	Too fucking bad.
8737244	8738344	Spoilers are going to get out there.
8738404	8740284	If not in text form, it's silly.
8741465	8744646	Anyway, if you want to do something about it... No, that's my problem right there, though.
8744946	8750988	That's not because your copyrights were violated or because someone's posting it as their own thing.
8751288	8753929	It's because, oh, we don't want spoilers coming out.
8754429	8758614	That's not a reason to go and say, hey, I need these videos taken down.
8759555	8763360	I'm sorry, but that's like, you know, a review spoiling the end of a book or something like that.
8763440	8767906	You can't force them to take it down because you don't like the fact that someone spoiled the book.
8769235	8773539	Alright, so anyhow, if you want to do something about SOPA, I gotta give props to Destructoid.
8773560	8776583	They compiled this pretty good article that they have on their website.
8776663	8779446	It was posted January 7th, talking about SOPA.
8779466	8785492	And they even have kind of some form letters that you can copy-paste, although I would kind of encourage you to put your own thing on it.
8785572	8788094	I mean, a lot of them probably aren't even going to get read, let's be real.
8788134	8790457	We should send this to put on our Tumblr, too.
8791011	8816407	um okay I'll do that uh send that over to um you know I'll get props to Destructoid they did and one other thing I like they compiled a list this is very useful a list of all these game companies where you can contact directly emails and websites and I thought that was pretty cool so you know you can take your case to the companies themselves that are supporting this I am do I need to even say like look at what happened to GoDaddy and that was whoo
8818226	8818947	That was a bit of a mess.
8819187	8820928	And talk about a backpedal there.
8820988	8821909	I mean, seriously.
8822149	8825591	Oh, actually, no, we're against SOPA now.
8825792	8826352	Yeah, right.
8828594	8834138	So let me send that over to Ranma, and he can put that on the Tumblr if you want to read more about that.
8834198	8835239	OrangeLaunchRadio.tumblr.com.
8837185	8837625	Alrighty.
8838606	8839847	Let's move on with some more news.
8840207	8844970	Getting into some phone calls very soon at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
8844990	8846391	But not just yet, a few more emails.
8846431	8846951	DarkSakura.
8847171	8849192	Yu Suzuki, who my husband has met.
8849633	8851314	I have a photo of Dan with Yu Suzuki.
8851494	8852334	It's very faded now.
8853115	8858158	But he said something in an interview with the Toulouse Game Show.
8858998	8859919	So this is in French.
8860659	8864622	And I'm going to read it in French, if I can remember my pronunciation right.
8864642	8867784	Nous pouvons obtenir la licence à partir de Sega.
8868665	8871267	Which means, we can obtain the license from Sega.
8871287	8872668	Do you know what they're talking about?
8873408	8873868	Shenmue.
8875149	8886017	So, he's not saying that they are actively going to do it, but I think it means that there might be an interest in them trying to obtain it for YSNet, which is his company.
8886037	8886297	Okay.
8886717	8888658	So, maybe it'll happen.
8888698	8890439	That would be kind of cool if it did, don't you think?
8891280	8891860	Very cool.
8892220	8894481	I think he should play a game of Lucky Hit.
8899504	8901445	You know all I ever did with that game was play Space Harrier.
8902245	8908729	Anyway, so you can, the interview is actually up on YouTube if you want to find it.
8908809	8910830	It's the Yu Suzuki interview on Shenmue.
8911470	8911570	Okay.
8913644	8915284	Alright, I would be great.
8915324	8916725	I'd love to see that series come back.
8916745	8918465	I think a lot of people would.
8918825	8920006	I think he wants to finish it.
8921346	8921466	True.
8921486	8921766	You know?
8922386	8924707	It's like he's got a story that's like mostly told.
8925427	8927208	It's got like one chapter left, really?
8928048	8930009	And he wants it out.
8931029	8931529	Alright, Loki.
8933628	8952132	I'm actually surprised that this took this long to settle, but you remember way back when, back before you could use USB drives on your Xbox 360, you were limited to their overpriced hard drives and their memory units, which really didn't have a lot of space on them and they were really expensive.
8953092	8978005	and a company, Datel, came out and had this wonderful max memory device that you could plop a micro SD card into and be able to save your games to that and everything was peachy keen until Microsoft patched the Xbox 360 to block these from being used on the device and of course then there was lawsuits filed and all that fun stuff.
8978045	8979326	Well, they've settled out of court.
8980146	8988732	Probably because at this point, even if that were to be allowed to be used on their system, no one's using the memory cards anymore because it doesn't work.
8988792	8991053	But the consumers who bought these didn't get anything.
8991334	8991954	No, they got nothing.
8991974	8997157	Well, hooray to these companies for settling, but the consumers got screwed, didn't they?
8997338	8997478	Yep.
8998218	9000519	What do they get out of it for buying these products that don't work?
9000619	9003100	The satisfaction knowing that the U.S.
9003140	9004420	justice system has triumphed.
9004440	9006121	Well, golly gee willikers, Loki.
9007141	9008182	Now I can sleep at night.
9009322	9010082	I'm glad you can.
9011683	9011983	All right.
9012623	9014684	Somebody's celebrating a birthday this week.
9014764	9018065	In fact, they're turning 30 years old, if you can believe it.
9018525	9019286	It's the Commodore 64.
9020871	9024593	That's right, the Commodore 64 celebrated its 30th birthday this week.
9024633	9027275	And all I have to say is, man, I feel old.
9027295	9029756	Because I grew up on the Commodore 64.
9029816	9031757	I remember having one of these.
9031817	9032978	I think we got it Christmas, like, 83.
9034098	9036080	But the Commodore 64 actually came out in 1982.
9036180	9039061	I love this.
9039281	9043624	The whole machine would hold the equivalent of 1 100th of an MP3 file.
9044204	9045545	Ha ha ha ha!
9046829	9065929	$595 is how much these systems cost back in 1982 they say that is now with inflation $1,400 today is how much these things cost it was first introduced at the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and yeah boy Commodore 64 now 30 years old and
9068300	9069341	Man, I love my Commodore 64.
9070081	9070822	So many good games.
9070882	9072523	And those SID chips, man.
9072723	9077987	So much chiptune stuff that you hear today is just directly influenced by the Commodore 64.
9078187	9079808	I wish I still had a working one of these.
9079848	9081289	I had a Commodore 64C.
9081709	9085311	We actually broke our original Commodore 64 and we got a 64C, the white one.
9086032	9087333	And that was a pretty awesome machine.
9087513	9088213	I was five.
9088854	9089514	Did you have one of these?
9089554	9090495	When it came out.
9090535	9091856	No, I told you I didn't have a Commodore 64.
9091896	9094117	I had a Clico Atom.
9097039	9097860	With a cassette deck.
9098709	9102672	By the way, on a related note, would you like to feel old for a minute?
9103253	9109258	Here are some other games that are turning, not systems, but games that are turning 30 years old this year in 2012.
9109638	9109999	You ready?
9110519	9114102	These games came out in 1982, making them 30 years old.
9114563	9123330	Bagman, Bump and Jump, Burger Time, one of my favorites, Dig Dug, Donkey Kong Jr.,
9124551	9146026	Gravatar, Joust by the way this list is from ArcadeHeroes.com I am upset with you Joust for influencing that horrible part of WoW Jungle Hunt or Jungle King depending on where you live Kangaroo I freaking love Kangaroo I played the crap out of that at Godfather's Pizza when I was little
9146962	9149784	Liberator, that's the first one I don't really recognize.
9149804	9150664	That was an Atari game.
9151004	9153125	Millipede, Moon Patrol.
9153265	9153965	Oh, God.
9154706	9155686	I used to love Moon Patrol.
9155726	9156667	We had this at Local Arcade.
9156747	9157507	Mr. Do.
9158267	9159068	I love Mr. Do.
9159608	9160288	Pango.
9160869	9161629	You love Pango.
9161669	9162709	Fucking love Pango.
9162729	9163430	That's a great game.
9164030	9165011	That's the little penguins.
9165051	9168752	You know, they had one at Pasquale's, and it finally broke.
9169573	9169713	Aw.
9170253	9171173	Pole Position.
9171333	9172054	Love Pole Position.
9172674	9173375	Popeye.
9174115	9174596	Remember that?
9174876	9177458	They did a Nintendo game out of it because Nintendo made it.
9177858	9181081	Reactor, Robotron 2084.
9181141	9182402	They had a version of that on Xbox Live.
9182422	9184263	That was one of the first arcade games that came out on Xbox Live.
9184844	9185144	Qbert.
9185645	9187786	That's another game I played the crap out of on my Kiko.
9188047	9189788	The swearing guy with a long nose.
9190849	9192510	Everybody thought this had an awesome name.
9192650	9193511	Satan's Hollow.
9193931	9197454	It's actually kind of a derpy game, but it was the midway game.
9198995	9207604	It's on the arcade treasures for Midway and all that, and you kind of see it in collections, but it runs on that same hardware as like Journey and Timber and some of those old classic Midway games.
9208485	9211648	Sinistar, beware, I live.
9212689	9220878	Space Duel, Star Trek, the Sega One, Time Pilot, Tootin' Com, Tron,
9222600	9226302	is 30 years old, and Zaxxon by Sagan.
9226322	9227923	30 years old.
9227963	9229604	That's what I need to do for Classic Game.
9231446	9232206	So there you go.
9232827	9235428	Now we can all feel old together.
9237810	9246275	Just think in 30 years when we're sitting here on our show celebrating the 40th anniversary going, hey, remember the Xbox 360?
9246855	9248797	Fucking bastard stole all my money.
9251533	9252513	Fuckin' thing broke!
9252994	9255075	After only having it a week, I had to send it in.
9256295	9257676	But damn, there were some good games.
9259717	9260077	Alright.
9260978	9263379	Hopefully by then we're all playing the holodeck, though.
9263399	9266680	Because remember, gaming is just inching forward slowly to the holodeck.
9268401	9276085	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call right now and talk to us.
9276225	9277806	Meanwhile, let's do some tweets!
9278956	9282599	We will start with a tweet from Ramaditya Knight.
9282619	9290846	It says, Sonic and Knuckles, I remember back in the day I used the cheat that allowed me to change Sonic to whatever item I want and cross the wall.
9291306	9294289	I found a lot of bugs like a place you were not supposed to be able to go there.
9294369	9295150	Spikes all around.
9295190	9298132	I wonder if that was something, is that like a code in the game or is that something like a game genie?
9298392	9300574	Remember the game genie where you could like hacksaw the game?
9301115	9304117	I'm sure, that is something that Loki had to own.
9304838	9305418	The game genie.
9305578	9306499	Oh yeah.
9306519	9307380	Of course I own the game genie.
9307580	9310681	He was talking about Sonic and Knuckles and some of the things you could do with that.
9310962	9311262	Yeah.
9311802	9318585	I used to actually sit down all night with my Game Genie and my SNES and just try to figure out different codes by altering other codes.
9319765	9321646	And I found a few ones, like ones that turned Mario green.
9322447	9322787	That was it.
9322827	9323927	All it did was turn Mario green.
9324367	9324968	That's all it does.
9325568	9326448	Yeah.
9326468	9328609	Makes Mario Luigi, but not really.
9328629	9329690	No, it turned his skin green.
9330250	9331871	All right, let's go to the phones because we're getting some calls.
9331911	9332791	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9332811	9333131	Who's this?
9334312	9334892	Hey, what's up, guys?
9334912	9335572	This is Kaijudo.
9335672	9336313	Hey, Kaijudo.
9336333	9336953	What's on your mind, buddy?
9338557	9339938	I just want to talk about the silver thing.
9339978	9342559	I think a lot of us are overreacting.
9342659	9345000	First off, I don't think it's going to go through.
9345320	9348441	And if it did go through, I don't think it's going to be that big of a deal.
9348481	9352483	I think that a lot of people are getting worked up and they're freaking out all over nothing.
9352523	9360687	I think pretty much what these companies want to do, you know, the game companies, movies, music, whatever, they just want to make money.
9360807	9366089	So pretty much this law going out is just going to be a way for them to protect their content.
9366488	9369549	and be able to put it on their sites and make the type of money that they want to make.
9369589	9376390	I don't think they're necessarily trying to shut down the internet or stop us from talking on Facebook or any of that kind of stuff.
9376630	9382911	Well, it's a fair viewpoint and I understand that, but could it happen to one person?
9383891	9391413	I mean, like again, I have to refer to the Atari thing at the beginning of the show that they're pulling down all these games that they may or may not have the ability to do.
9392173	9409664	and I worry that legal departments of companies who don't really understand things might go a little batshit crazy and the problem is if you leave the door or what's the expression you give them an inch and they take a yard I worry about putting that much power into a corporation's hand because you and me can't fight it
9411549	9411809	True.
9412730	9414210	I can see your point there.
9415491	9417991	Clearly, I understand why they want to do something about piracy.
9418312	9418772	I get it.
9419172	9421693	But can you ever really stop piracy?
9422433	9423453	I'm not so sure.
9423674	9425074	There's no way they can stop it.
9425294	9426374	This isn't going to do it.
9427215	9438779	I don't mean to cut you off, but if you look at the record, as far as piracy goes, when it comes to movies and video games, a lot of the stuff that's highly pirated are also the stuff that sells the most.
9440374	9454238	I think music is the only place where they should really do something about piracy because you don't have to mod anything on your system to be able to play the illegal downloaded music that you download.
9454979	9461501	So I think the music industry is the one that's taking the real heat from it, but not necessarily the games and the movie industry.
9463171	9470715	You know, and again, I understand they want to do something, but I just think this is going to do more harm than good because what's it really going to fix?
9471456	9476919	The IP for the Pirate Bay will be out there within minutes of this thing passing, and everybody will have it.
9476959	9479801	And there will be add-ons for Google Chrome and Firefox.
9479841	9481202	There already are.
9481222	9482242	There already are.
9482722	9486865	So, I mean, it's not going to do any good.
9488646	9513964	but I understand why they want to do something but I think at the end of the day it's going to be accountability you want to prove that someone stole money from a bank they got to go to court, have a trial that's kind of what's got to happen in this case they just need to understand the internet more they're still trying to treat the internet like if it's the real world where it doesn't necessarily work like that so I think that they need to seriously look this over
9514611	9518664	and come up with the better law, the better soap or whatever the hell you want to call it.
9518745	9520611	But I'm not really that worried about it.
9521954	9523035	I don't know.
9523775	9524756	I hope you're right.
9525857	9529219	But I do worry about leaving that opportunity there.
9529339	9533421	But you're a little more optimistic than I. So I applaud you for that.
9533641	9534422	So I hope you're right.
9535082	9537003	Optimistic to a fault.
9537443	9537644	All right.
9537704	9538944	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9538964	9539725	You guys have a good night.
9539885	9540105	All right.
9540125	9540625	You too, buddy.
9540665	9540906	Take care.
9540926	9541266	Good night.
9541726	9542146	Bye.
9542647	9543167	You know what?
9543447	9545248	It's cool that he has a differing opinion.
9545268	9545728	Again, I hope...
9549091	9550532	And I think he said it best at the end there.
9550592	9551973	Maybe he's optimistic to a fault.
9552114	9553735	But, you know, we'll see.
9553915	9554256	We'll see.
9554836	9555978	Actions speak louder than words.
9556038	9556478	So we'll see.
9556498	9563285	But I just have a feeling the first time a website gets shut down incorrectly, it's going to just, all hell's going to break loose.
9563725	9564967	All right.
9564987	9566008	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9566068	9567849	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9567889	9569191	Meanwhile, we have some more tweets.
9569645	9572927	Hey guys, it's DDR Dollar Bill DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind buddy?
9596345	9596785	Not much.
9597026	9598767	First off, I want to wish you guys a happy new year.
9598887	9600788	We're getting some feedback.
9600808	9601869	Back away from your speakers, buddy.
9601929	9603110	Back away from your speakers if you can.
9603170	9603991	We're getting bad feedback.
9604591	9605492	Happy new year to you.
9606352	9606893	How's this now?
9608154	9609735	I'm still hearing it, but it's not killing me.
9609815	9610375	It's not horrible.
9610516	9612077	Get out your question or comment fast.
9612257	9613238	We'll try to make this a quick call.
9614418	9615059	Oh, okay.
9615920	9616740	Which is a quick story.
9617301	9625827	A while back, I don't know if I posted it, but I said that I stopped playing WoW because I got sick of all the jackasses kept bitching about everything I kept doing in the game.
9627537	9627937	Can you hear me?
9628098	9628978	Yeah, we can hear you.
9629018	9631841	Yeah, people are assholes on the internet, unfortunately.
9632802	9637466	Yeah, so for a long time I pretty much just quit whole MMORPGs.
9638107	9640369	Then I tried a couple other free ones out there.
9641430	9645473	And then I tried out DC Universe when it came out for free.
9646294	9649517	To the point I loved it so much I actually bought the DLCs for it.
9649917	9652860	So you're saying the community in DC Universe Online maybe not so bad?
9654717	9670249	Um, considering that one time I played 1.30 in the morning and we were making jokes about, um, let's see, 16 year olds and an all women's squad and everybody was dueling in the middle of nowhere, it was a lot more fun.
9671189	9673549	Yeah, but it goes back to WoW for one last thing, because I'll keep it short.
9673570	9673650	Okay.
9700618	9707786	When I finally hit level 30 in EC Universe, the final level, I found out that I actually have to group.
9708867	9712991	And it made me realize that maybe it's okay to group with people once in a while.
9713091	9715013	Just gotta find the right group.
9715073	9722081	So I went back on WoW, I quit this one guild I was with, and I joined up with another guild, and it was a whole different experience.
9722918	9724019	Well, I have to tell you something.
9724059	9724799	Perfect story.
9724839	9729281	I've got to hang up on you, DDR Darla Bill, though, because the chat room is saying it sounds like you're living in a bee's nest.
9729641	9730802	But thank you so much, buddy.
9730842	9731322	Have a good one.
9731662	9732963	Let me say something to him.
9733343	9733683	He'll hear it.
9734244	9736945	Well, here's what I was going to tell you, and just message me in the chat room.
9738206	9743088	When I started playing WoW, when I finally liked it again, I did not play with other people at all.
9743808	9746730	All I did was chat with the guild and quest by myself.
9747470	9749591	and yeah, and I've done two characters that way.
9750171	9752191	I did Rebecca Black and Arisa both that way.
9752631	9757032	But now I've actually got a character that I'm doing nothing but instances with.
9757753	9760633	And maybe seasonal quests and little things.
9761274	9769676	But the point is that I'm actually trying to group with other people and I've found that actually not every group is full of idiots.
9770116	9770876	A lot of them are.
9771576	9774337	Many of them don't have proper grammar and they're very hard to understand.
9775117	9781160	But for the most part, it's partly your support group outside of your pugs.
9795947	9798250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9813131	9819317	You gotta understand, a lot of these people are just doing it to get their rocks off, you know what I mean?
9819637	9821579	Oh yeah, you know, Frat Matt, yeah, you know him.
9821599	9822680	He's been on this show too.
9823261	9831248	He and me and John were running an instance and decided to completely troll the people that we were with, and Mary.
9831768	9832049	Uh-huh.
9832629	9834710	decided to completely troll our fifth person.
9835070	9835591	Yeah.
9835631	9839212	That poor person doesn't know that you're just fucking with them.
9839713	9842674	We finally had one person hang out with us.
9843194	9846696	Now keep in mind, and people who play WoW will know what it is, it was in Halls of Origination.
9847236	9850498	We got to the last, we did all of the bosses, all of them.
9850598	9850918	All of them?
9851298	9852239	In Halls of Origination.
9852579	9857381	We finally get to the last guy and we get a person who's just really cool and playing along with us.
9857961	9859562	We're like, that's what we wanted.
9859682	9861223	We wanted the person who would play with us.
9861323	9862784	I'm calling in to do a con report Con report?
9862804	9863445	Who had a con at New Year's?
9863465	9868810	Actually, it was MagFest this weekend Oh, this weekend, okay, I guess this weekend's not so bad Alright, MagFest, how was it?
9888203	9888723	It was pretty good.
9888763	9895626	It was down in D.C., and basically it's just a big arcade festival.
9895906	9901349	Okay, I was going to say, is this the Sony game mag, or is this like a... Okay, so it's an arcade game, okay.
9902029	9902930	It's arcade games.
9904130	9912834	A lot of people bring arcade machines, and it's also a big show for video game music.
9913775	9914455	Oh, cool.
9915595	9919519	This year, their guest of honor was Nobuo Matsu and his band.
9920520	9921701	Oh, the Black Mages?
9923142	9924703	No, Earthbound Papas.
9925264	9926685	Oh, I didn't know he had another one.
9926725	9927366	Okay, very cool.
9928975	9947510	and but yeah you know they had it was uh the thing is it's a 24-hour convention so at any so at any point you know if you have a if you feel like you know you want to play DDR or Pong or Killer Instincts 2 Arcade Machine you can go down three o'clock in the morning you could play
9947890	9953174	Wait, so you're saying like it's a 24-7, like for the weekend, or it literally is 24 hours?
9953674	9956176	It's literally like 24-7 from Thursday to Sunday.
9956196	9956656	Oh, okay.
9956837	9957977	Okay, well, that's still really cool.
9958138	9960279	That's got to be a bitch to staff, but that's awesome.
9960699	9962401	I kind of wish California Extreme would do that.
9963161	9965783	Yeah, but... No, you know what?
9965903	9970747	It actually is kind of like California Extreme, where, you know, there's about like 150 arcade machines.
9970967	9972948	I mean, I got to... I mean, my whole goal...
9975379	9978822	was to try to get a high score on one classic arcade game.
9979443	9982606	And I managed to get the high score on Road Blasters.
9982986	9984087	Road Blasters!
9984207	9985308	Oh my god, I remember that one.
9985328	9986129	Road Blasters is awesome.
9986149	9987010	Yeah, good times.
9987330	9988611	It's also hell's hard.
9989392	9989972	Amen to that.
9990072	9994937	Did you get to play anything new that you'd never really played before that you were like, wow, how did I miss this growing up?
9996308	9996828	You know what?
9997168	10007391	I was, you know, a lot of old games like NARC and Bad Dudes that really took me back because I haven't seen those things since the early 80s.
10008812	10015714	But, you know, also I was introduced to a lot of old games that, you know, I've never seen or heard of.
10016834	10019675	This crazy game Ice Cold Beer.
10021716	10022516	Sounds like Tapper.
10024096	10025197	No, it's not really like that.
10025237	10025597	It's like you...
10027421	10030723	You're playing with two levers and you're trying to put a ball into a hole.
10031643	10033424	That sounds kind of dirty.
10033524	10034805	Yeah, it sounds kind of sexual.
10036886	10037847	I've been to that party.
10041409	10042949	The internet's seen that party, Rob.
10044682	10046703	Alright, but no, I get what you're saying.
10047584	10048124	Very cool.
10048805	10050005	No, it's definitely cool.
10050406	10051706	Did they have speakers or anything?
10051766	10052967	Oh, I guess just the musicians.
10053508	10054908	Well, no, they had a lot of speakers.
10054928	10058130	They had, you know, the Angry Video Game Nerd, Brennel Floss, you know, a lot of people.
10058170	10059571	I love the Angry Video Game Nerd.
10061072	10061993	That's awesome.
10062033	10064214	It's a very, you know, very small convention.
10064714	10066115	But, you know, it's big.
10066255	10072019	So, you know, not only were you able to play classic arcade games, you were also able to check out
10073511	10077512	console games and play stuff on a TV.
10077672	10081473	Well, damn, if I'm able to get another two and a half weeks off work next holiday, I might have to come out there.
10081493	10082614	That sounds like an awesome con.
10083114	10083714	I love DC.
10083734	10084694	I'd love an excuse to go back.
10086015	10087835	But I guess I need to get to New York City first, huh?
10090296	10091396	Gotta stop going to Disneyland.
10091416	10093617	You guys are going to have to confiscate my annual pass for that to happen.
10095539	10096640	They moved Disneyland.
10097361	10098743	Disneyland burned down, sorry to say.
10099284	10102227	Alright, SSJ100 Matt, thanks so much for telling us about the con.
10102247	10102688	I had no idea.
10102728	10106212	I'm on the wrong coast, so I had no idea this was happening, but I'm definitely going to check it out for next year.
10107214	10107514	Definitely.
10107594	10108235	Alright, take care, buddy.
10110305	10111666	Thank you guys so much for the phone calls.
10111686	10117790	We're going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line for now so we can wrap up the last few topics here and close up shop for the night.
10117830	10126316	But if you didn't get through tonight and you have something you really want to say, be sure to send us a tweet at twitter.com slash OLR or you can email us, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
10126576	10129338	Speaking of tweets, I wanted to finish Tiger Claw's thought here.
10129418	10133440	Apparently, this is coming from a leak at the Sony booth at CES.
10133901	10139605	It's showing on the PlayStation 3 something called Play Memory Studio which will be... Excuse me.
10141026	10141986	Oh, worst thing to happen on radio.
10142607	10144988	A video editing suite for the PlayStation 3.
10146189	10151473	Apparently you can put effects in video and kind of do some editing live on the PlayStation 3.
10151753	10152934	That's kind of cool, I guess.
10153495	10159059	I already thought the PlayStation did kind of allow some limited video stuff, but that's cool if they're enhancing it, especially if it's free.
10160099	10161020	I wonder if it'll be free.
10161480	10162141	I somehow doubt it.
10162881	10168165	TomN1 on Twitter sent us this and I saw this earlier this week because somebody posted this on Facebook.
10168185	10169206	It's fucking hilarious.
10169566	10172228	It's a Macho Man dragon mod in Skyrim.
10172268	10173189	Loki, have you seen this?
10174850	10175811	It's great.
10177813	10183277	This is the beginning of the game.
10183397	10184077	Here it is again.
10184718	10185298	Did you hear that?
10186999	10189021	I said, next prisoner.
10189421	10190422	To the block, prisoner.
10190962	10191663	Nice and easy.
10193208	10194669	This is actually being rendered from the game.
10194709	10196191	It's not like a fan-edited thing.
10197292	10198092	With the mod, of course.
10207161	10209683	Macho madness, sky's the limit!
10214395	10220497	It is a thing of pure terror.
10220897	10224458	Oh my god, it's a giant Macho Man!
10227459	10229139	Yeah, the dragon's wearing a Macho Man hat.
10229759	10230440	That's great!
10231820	10236161	With the beard and everything.
10236542	10238102	I'm making Alan install this mod.
10242998	10244079	It's really creepy.
10244239	10245379	I fucking love that.
10245419	10246219	That's amazing.
10246479	10247420	You want to know something, Rob?
10247640	10248660	I need that on the Tumblr.
10249061	10249701	That song.
10250361	10252422	Here's stories from Jamie's childhood.
10253302	10258965	Disco Inferno, which keep in mind, I had two copies of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack on vinyl.
10258985	10264427	I used to stand on my bed dancing in my pajamas to Disco Inferno.
10265539	10268961	I gave that to Ranma for the Twitter because that video is just too damn good if you haven't seen it yet.
10269061	10270602	I also posted the link in chat.
10270702	10271243	So there you go.
10271463	10271943	Enjoy, guys.
10272403	10276026	It's the one that says TeeCo because I got it from Twitter because TomN linked that.
10276486	10276906	So there you go.
10277586	10277847	All right.
10278367	10281989	And lastly, a couple tweets here from ZenMonkey69 tweets us.
10283911	10289577	HeHe69 tweets us saying, It's 2012 and we have a shitload of video game sequels coming.
10289977	10295143	What games do you think don't deserve a sequel and should just die?
10296400	10298822	What games don't deserve a sequel and should just die?
10298842	10299182	Imagine Babies
10320655	10327082	Taiki, I hope I'm saying that right, in chat says Elder Scrolls, just throwing it down, saying there's too damn many Elder Scrolls games.
10327422	10328824	I don't know about that.
10328844	10329524	Skyrim's pretty fun.
10329545	10331146	Yeah, you won't have another Elder Scrolls game in 2012.
10332007	10333929	You'll have expansions for Skyrim, that's for sure.
10334530	10335210	Yeah, for sure.
10335851	10337593	Franchises that need to die.
10339575	10340476	Oh, God.
10346362	10352366	Part of me wants to be cynical and say the Just Dance series, but at parties they can be kind of fun.
10355107	10359830	I can't really think of anything, because honestly, if I don't want to play them, I just ignore that they exist.
10359850	10361111	That's kind of where I'm at.
10361131	10364433	I don't think a lot about the games that I don't want to play.
10365414	10368335	I can be super cynical and go, oh, Call of Duty, because I don't play those games.
10368375	10370236	But I realize other people do play those games.
10370937	10371017	Yeah.
10374744	10376324	I'm kind of looking over at my own collection.
10376524	10377745	How about Tetris Remakes?
10378805	10379245	Yeah.
10379285	10380505	That's another one I'm getting sick of.
10380525	10383166	Blastris was kind of fun, but that was back in the Super Scope days.
10383386	10387547	Apparently that 3DS one's pretty good, but it's still the same fucking game we've been playing forever.
10389968	10392108	It might be time for the Need for Speed series to die.
10392568	10392889	Maybe.
10394769	10396109	That would be another answer I would have.
10398650	10401451	Well, or at least evolve it or something.
10401731	10402111	I don't know.
10402851	10403191	Sonic Games
10424850	10425891	SILENT HILL
10446265	10447325	I kind of agree.
10447506	10451969	Non-Kanami Japan produced Silent Hill games specifically Need to Die.
10451989	10454831	It needs to go back in-house to Kanami Japan.
10454851	10455271	I agree.
10455311	10456352	Silent Hill's kind of done.
10456672	10461155	And Carriker Revolution Glee needs to die.
10461175	10462376	Oh, there you go.
10462416	10462536	Winner.
10462556	10464298	How about everything Glee needs to die?
10464318	10466039	How about Glee needs to get cancelled?
10467040	10467340	Alright.
10468749	10474157	Last, another tweet from Zen, since I haven't read tweets from Zen before, I will read two tweets tonight.
10474597	10484511	Zen says, if PlayStation 4, Xbox Lube, and the Nintendo Wii U were all coming out on the same day, and you could only get one, which system would you get?
10485123	10486445	Too early!
10487286	10487946	How can he answer that?
10487966	10494914	Because we don't know what the Xbox Lube and the PlayStation 4 have to offer, and we only know about half of what the Wii U's really bring into the table.
10495675	10500420	So you'd be asking me to base that decision based off of the current consoles.
10500781	10504925	And the problem with that is the jump we made from the last...
10505706	10505986	and DarkSakura.
10521357	10525140	You know, so it's just, it's way too early to call.
10527562	10534367	Here's also the realistic in me is like, well, I'm going to end up with them all anyway because I have this sick addiction to video games and do this show and everything.
10534427	10541472	So it's kind of like... I'm going to try to show some restraint, at least maybe not buying one of the consoles, if not two of the consoles.
10541492	10542072	Good luck.
10543093	10570772	you know what though honestly with you would have played on the Wii and stuff I think it's gonna be pretty easy for the Wii U I think I say that now I will humor the question and I'm gonna say PlayStation 4 and the reason why is because I just have the feeling out of the three systems it's going to be the most advanced because I think it's gonna be the one that's in the incubator the longest meaning I think it'll be the last of the three to come out so I think it's gonna have the best processor in it and all that I
10571172	10584251	but again, that doesn't necessarily make it the best, but I literally have nothing else to go off of right now, you know so, I'm gonna say PlayStation 4 just to humor the question, but that could change, absolutely so
10585430	10588693	All right, that's it for the Twitters tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.
10588813	10590134	Oh, actually, I see one.
10591075	10591575	Oh, never mind.
10591615	10592836	That's somebody new following us.
10592876	10593777	Thank you on Twitter.
10594558	10597100	Twitter combines the followers and the app messages now.
10597140	10597640	It's really weird.
10597980	10602624	All right, anyway, last-minute stories, Loki, DarkSakura, anything for last-minute stories?
10604446	10604586	No.
10605547	10605767	Loki?
10607824	10610747	My story is that I had trouble finding a Cage Mad song.
10610787	10613310	Thankfully, I downloaded one a while ago, so then I'll be fine.
10614251	10615332	It's not my preference.
10616534	10619297	They've had some better songs, but I'm going to put it in anyways.
10620023	10622885	Alright, that's going to do it then for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10622945	10625567	Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.
10626728	10626988	Sorry.
10627568	10628128	How rude.
10628169	10633712	It's a step way, way, way back to the beginning of the show here and we're talking about best games of 2011.
10633792	10638135	It's not really a game, but I have to recommend Ready Player One.
10638175	10640917	Seriously, if you haven't read it yet, you need to read it because it's awesome.
10641758	10645000	If you're a fan of games, especially a fan of classic games, you're going to love this.
10647882	10648202	Excuse me.
10649204	10651326	and any of them to actually sign my book.
10651346	10654088	That'd be pretty awesome if he's going to hit a con or something.
10654449	10655429	I'm getting coffin fit again.
10655489	10656030	I got to say this.
10656070	10665518	I think I'm allowed to say this because it's out there posted on the internet but apparently in Sacramento there's going to be a group that is going to do a live shadow casting a la Rocky Horror of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.
10665698	10666619	I want to see this.
10666659	10667660	And I can't wait.
10667880	10677208	As much as I have kind of a love-hate with that movie and there are things I loved about it and things I didn't like about it I think that's going to be awesome because you know that theater is going to be full of nerds
10678048	10680509	that are into it, you know, and I think it's going to be a great showing.
10680549	10688993	I definitely am going to see, because I know the guys that are behind it through some of the stuff I did last year, so I'm going to see if we can get OLR sponsored or something.
10689773	10690233	Coins?
10690613	10691834	Oh, oh.
10692174	10692934	From the movie, I get it.
10693394	10693915	Alright, anyhow.
10694735	10696456	You were talking about Ready Player One.
10696476	10697556	People are going to throw quarters.
10698516	10703158	Ready Player One has been an option for a movie, but I don't see how the fuck they're going to be able to do that.
10703178	10703698	Seriously, though.
10704839	10706920	I'll get you Ready Player One.
10708773	10725551	Legend of Zaku in chat says oh wow Rocky Horror Picture Show finally has competition now hold on Becky wants to go too there's there Rocky's kind of like it's just there can be more than one movie in the theater at a time and Rocky's just always there's always more than one cult movie Repo the Genetic Opera for example is really big on the midnight circuit right now
10726051	10726492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10740908	10743750	Anyhow, off subject, we're trying to wrap up the show.
10744091	10747073	I was going to say thank you very much for downloading the show and tuning in to us.
10747374	10752077	Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, we don't put commercials in the show, we don't make you buy things or whatever.
10752438	10754379	All we ask, tell people about the show.
10754520	10757722	Spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar website.
10758183	10763067	We rely on you guys to help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio and we really, really appreciate it.
10763587	10790932	OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the website the forums are there if you want to post on the forums I have to say though right now it's locked down to new accounts because yeah we were really getting killed with spammers there so I just shut off accounts all together so hopefully within the next month or two we're going to just totally revamp the forums and hopefully be able to avoid the spam bots if you really want an account on the forums in the meantime email the show directly and we'll set one up for you Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you don't already have one
10791332	10810451	and Legend of Zaku I totally agree Priscilla Queen of the Desert is the closest thing they can take on Rocky Horror Picture Show that's a Broadway thing now so yeah it was supposed to come out on Broadway I'm pretty sure it did so alright anyhow that's it now we're talking Broadway we're way off the subject of video games
10810791	10814272	We'll be back next week to talk more games and gaming news with you guys.
10814613	10815833	So have a wonderful week everybody.
10815873	10817434	We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10817474	10817774	Good night.
10834841	10835502	or allgames.com.
10835542	10836803	But we're probably right anyway.
10836823	10837343	See you next week!
