Tonight, January 29th, 2012, a network makeover is rumored for Nintendo consoles, a new handheld may bring back a classic gaming system, and Steam goes mobile with a new iOS app.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on this January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
First off, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you, Ms.
Summers?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
My mommy just had surgery and I know she hasn't listened to the show, but I'm thinking about my mother.
She had surgery on Friday, but she's doing a lot better.
So I had to go visit her today because she's out of the hospital.
Anyhow, let's talk about who else is here with us here in studio.
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Hi.
How are you, Tech Master Loki?
I'm fine.
Are you on your period or are we good?
I'm fine, I guess.
You're always angry on this show, no matter what it is.
I was like, I don't know how to answer that.
Yes.
What's new with Loki?
Not much.
Just playing Skyrim.
All right.
Well, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit.
But first, I have to plug, of course, the lovely All Games Radio, where we do our show every week.
www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
It is where we tape live.
If you are listening live...
and we hope you do sometime if you have been listening on the podcast all these years.
If you are listening live, join us in our chat room.
Just point your browsers over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com and there's a fine little Java chat room that will open right up and you can join our chat room.
If you prefer to do it the old school way, you can do it with an IRC client still because our chat room is IRC based and you just want to connect to the Game Surge Network at irc.gamesurge.net and we are in channel with the channel sign of the pound Orange Lounge.
This is where you can find us
Hey, Rob.
Yes, ma'am.
I have to share the neat thing that I just posted in the chat room.
Okay.
Apparently, some nerd has narrowed down when Ice Cube's good day was.
Like, isn't today was a good day?
What day was it?
Well, I'll just... Wasn't today, right?
I'll go through just a quickie on this one.
The clues were they were watching Yo!
MTV Raps, which started on August 6, 1988.
The single was released on February 23, 1993, and the Lakers beat the Supersonics.
Okay.
so they narrowed down all of those dates and then went to clue four the dates the Laker wins over the Supersonics was a clear day with no smog so they narrowed it down to November 30th 88 and at the date in 89 91 and 92 good lord some people have too much free time
Clue 5.
Got a beep from Kim.
So it was when beepers were available.
So that led it to two dates.
January 18th, 1991.
January 20th, 1992.
Clue 6.
Ice Cube started filming Boys in the Hood in 1991.
There was only one day.
I'm going to quote this.
Only one day where UMTV Reps was on air.
It was a clear and smogless day.
Beepers were commercially sold.
Lakers beat the Supersonics and Ice Cube had no events to attend.
January 20th, 1992.
National Good Day Day.
So we just celebrated 20 years of today was a good day 20 years ago.
Yeah.
What an incredibly useless piece of information.
But I thought it was cool that someone went to the trouble and I wanted to share it.
That's when the good day was.
And for those listening to Orange Lawns Radio for the first time, those are the lovely types of tidbits you can expect.
But we will get into video games here in a minute.
First, I have to apologize to LiveLicious and the podcasters.
There was no live show last week and it was a little bit last minute.
We had to cancel the show due to illness.
And I was a little bit self-conscious about it last week.
I didn't want to talk about it a whole lot, but I'll talk about it now.
I had pink eye, which is why we didn't have the show last week.
The undead plague.
Or is, what did Victoria call it?
Eye herps or something like that.
Look.
DarkSakura just choked on her soda when I said that.
It's like, what am I, seven and going to a preschool where kids are putting fingers in their butt and their eye or something?
No, I work in a place with adults and stuff.
I don't know.
We had a pink eye outbreak at work.
It just... Undead plague.
I don't know what happened.
Someone got careless with the mascara at work.
I got pink eye because I do work with primarily women and I got pink eye just because everybody else in the office had it so unfortunately what that means is that nobody wants to come over to Rob's house where the studio is or touch the equipment and everything like that because he has pink eye and when one co-host has a kid at home and you know the other just doesn't want pink eye it kind of fucks up the show for the night oh no you are you I was eating cheesecake fuck your pink eye something
Pink Eye, WTF?
yes but you have to remember pink eye is super duper contagious like it's not like I lick the eyes of these women I work with like if you touch something they've touched you can get it like break room stuff you know so so yeah yeah yet Alan who lives here with me never got it so I don't know what that's about maybe you have natural immunity to the undead plague you will be the salvation of us all
And I actually wiped down all of the mics in the studio area with Clark's wipes to make sure.
You're so considerate, thank you.
Yeah, I never got pink eye, so Rob's lying.
This whole story's a lie.
I had a very, very minor case of pink eye, and yet it was like Alan went through here in a hazmat suit making sure he would not get it no matter what happened.
So, uh, um, Ahamakara in our chat room at chat.orange.com says someone wasn't washing their hands after using the potty.
Okay.
First off, I find that to be one of the most disgusting habits of men that I see in the potty is that I see guys who just walk in the restroom, do their thing, walk right out.
They don't even flush.
They don't even stop to walk, wash their hands.
And if that's you...
And you know who you are, that's gross.
A, flush.
B, wash.
It's not that hard.
Although, I will say, it has been proven that the place with the most germs on the body is actually the mouth and the hands.
So you were right about not washing the hands regularly.
However, the butt is one of the cleanest places.
Thank you for that piece of information So what have I learned today?
January 20th was a good day And my ass is kind of clean after all Thank you And urine is sterile
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There's really nothing to talk about until it airs, though.
That's true.
So I guess we'll just combine the two worlds a little bit.
I tried.
All right.
So going around in Xbox bullshit this week.
I don't know, it might be true, but look, it's the pink elephant in the room.
Everybody's talking about it.
It's the whole, the new Xbox, which we're calling, we will not call it the Xbox 720 here on Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm sorry, that's not what it's going to be called.
We already decided weeks ago, amongst a highly scientific process, we will refer to this system as the Xbox Lube until Microsoft gives us something better.
So the Xbox Lube supposedly is not going to play used games whatsoever.
That I guess there's this...
Amazing technology that will just fuck your disc up once you install a game or something.
Loki, clue us all in.
How is this technology supposed to work?
I don't fucking know.
It doesn't exist.
It's going to use these cardboard rings.
Basically, what happens is it'll prompt you to enter in a special code that's generated by turning these rings so that you can create a certain phrase.
Like, for example, Banana Monkey Pirate.
Or you'll have to get out the instruction manual and look up the keyword on page 24.
Some of which may actually require the use of a decoder device that will be a red plastic transparent piece of... I don't know, codes?
Okay, no.
What I think I was reading about what's supposed to happen is it's supposed to be that the Xbox would have a burner in it, that the drive functions is both a burner and a reader, and once you play the game for the first time, it would basically burn your console's serial into the disc.
and at that point it would only work on that console and I'm like that has got to be the most hideous idea I've ever heard like really like so I can't take a disc over to a friend's house anymore and play the game I mean that's how crazy we're getting
It's not gonna happen.
GameStop, who is by far the biggest company out there selling games to consumers.
And it'd be also the same way if they decided, hey, we're going to go digital only.
Now granted, with that, they could sell the little cards that they're doing now.
That's fine.
But, I mean, there's not a lot of money to be made in new games.
It's all used sales is where they're making their money.
And, yeah, they could probably, you know, force some sort of kickbacks from, you know, these hardware manufacturers.
But it's not going to happen.
It's just not...
No one's going to buy into that.
They're going to be like, fuck that bullshit.
I'm going to buy a PlayStation or a Wii U. We definitely see game companies are already trying to kind of cut at the knees a little bit of the used game market.
We see the online passes.
We see a big push towards digital distribution.
Like, isn't the Vita supposed to have the games are cheaper now to download than they are?
But they haven't released any of those yet, so we don't know.
I mean, Japan, I mean, it may be a little bit cheaper.
But even still, though, it's just...
That stuff is kind of to entice you to buy new, not forcing you to buy new.
And, I mean, they're not going to do anything like that anyways to tie it to one system.
Because, come on, what company had a huge failure rate with their launch systems?
Who's really going to risk that bullshit?
Oh, I bought 20 games, but now they're all fucking useless because my system died.
I don't think so.
They're not going to do that.
It would be so ridiculous to even try to do that.
And let's just say that...
Thanks for watching!
Now, granted, I think that was only one theory about how it's all supposed to work.
I mean, that theory is so vague and just like, well, here's how I think.
It doesn't make any sense.
They're just making assumptions.
There's no data to support that.
Yes, will they continue on this trend where they're going to have some sort of code that you put in to give you some extra something or other?
Yeah, maybe.
Are they going to maybe do something where it's going to tie it to your console as far as like...
Your game saves or something, maybe.
I don't know, but I think Microsoft's a little bit more lax with that at least.
You're tying them to at least your profile.
But even that, you can get around.
I just don't think anyone's going to do anything that ballsy right now as far as making it where used games will just not play on the system.
Because I'm telling you, if one does that and the other ones don't, that's a big disadvantage for them.
I mean, because GameStop will just say, fuck you guys, I'm not going to support your system as much.
Well, you know what?
Microsoft's in an interesting situation as well with the whole online pass is that I don't think Microsoft can still justify the online pass for their first party games.
And if they do it, there's going to be a lot of crap that they're going to start getting because notice they're the one company that kind of hasn't been able to do it yet because they're charging for Xbox Live.
So, I mean, literally, they're going to start double dipping for online passes.
See, here's the thing, though.
Theirs is a little bit different.
It's the same, it's same but different, I guess.
They have content that comes with the launch, I guess the launch pressing or whatever, the first pressing of a game.
They have extra content that comes with it.
Now, the thing is, so they're not fucking putting out there saying, hey, this is our online pass.
It's just, it's download content.
Like, for example, I think with Alan Wake, you got like an episode or something for, it's like the first piece of download content for free.
And that's cool that they're putting something in there for you to entice you to buy new.
And that's all they have to do is spin it with EA instead of saying this is an online pass.
They say, hey, guess what?
The first launch pressing of this game is going to get some extra download content with it.
Oh my god, you don't even have to fucking call it an online pass.
Why did you call it an online pass?
There's such a negative connotation with that.
And you're just going to go and cut yourself at the knees just because this is what you've done in the other games?
Just say, hey, look, it's a bonus DLC that we're putting out for those people that buy new.
If you buy it used, you can still enjoy the wonderful game, but you're going to have to buy the DLC.
I mean, that's not that bad.
And people can kind of expect it.
Why should I get fucking free DLC if I didn't buy the game new?
It's just how they're phrasing it.
They really were dumb how they phrased it.
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeonestradio.com, Amiga777 says, unless the next Xbox is download only, then that could be a problem.
It's not going to fucking happen.
Well, let me say something for a minute.
You can't be download only because we all have those caps on the Comcast service and stuff.
It's still a 250 gig cap.
One Xbox 360 game, if it's a big one, I mean, some of them don't really fill up the disk.
They're like maybe 900 megs.
Some of them, though, like, you know, are probably, what, a good four or five gigabytes.
Blu-rays, especially.
It's on average six gigs.
Yeah.
So, I mean, you can only download so many of those.
And if you're streaming more movies, something's going to give.
Everybody wants a piece of this.
Now Xbox wants to charge me to, you know, download the game because I can't buy it used anymore.
But yet Comcast wants to charge me for using the bandwidth to download the game.
I mean, the consumers are going to reject this.
at some point.
They're going to say it's not worth it.
Go back to playing the old system.
And once again, some people will buy digital downloads, and they have that out there right now.
There's nothing wrong with offering things in multiple ways, whether you want to buy a new disc, you want to buy a used disc, you want to buy a digital copy, you want to rent, whatever.
There's nothing wrong with that.
giving people options.
But when you start forcing people to download only, then people aren't going to buy your system.
Hello, PSP Go.
Yeah, I know.
I think the PSP Go is a great example of that.
I know people that own a PSP Go that actually really like the system from a hardware perspective and all of that.
So it really sounds like what happened with the PSP Go was kind of a tragedy because their whole implementing the digital download thing kind of got rejected by the user base as a whole and only, you know,
Definitely people that were more into hardware and the gamophobes or whatever you want to call them, gamophiles, were really into the system.
Otherwise, it was really rejected by people.
And I think if the game makers kind of go down that path of making these systems that are going to be really complicated and expensive for the end user, I think they are going to make a hideous mistake that most people...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Okay, first off, most of those people aren't going to know what a DivX machine is.
But you know what I mean, right?
The second that people aren't going to be comfortable, you know, your average consumer, sadly, is not comfortable with understanding how digital downloads work and stuff.
They don't understand how...
That is... And that's why I don't think, like, WiiWare's taken off, really, for Nintendo as far as, like, I think more of the hardcore crowd.
Because no one's... I mean, if they offered it in a way, they presented it like Wii Sports Resort had DLC or something like that.
Well, of course, you know, none of the Nintendo games had DLC.
If they had DLC for, like, Wii Sports Resort, maybe they would have sold some stuff.
But...
I think most people aren't comfortable with that.
I mean, hell, with those wireless systems, I'd be willing to bet most people didn't know how to hook it up to their internet, let alone be able to have the equipment to hook it up to their internet, because a lot of people don't have Wi-Fi in their house.
Bochikawa in our chatroom at chat.orangelandredo.com says, I saw a PSP go for sale at Kmart last week, and I said, huh, didn't know they still made those.
Oh, wait, those were probably just never taken off the shelf.
Dude, you were at Kmart.
I was at Kmart What did you find?
Dust bunnies?
No, I bought cat litter there Because cat litter doesn't go bad It doesn't matter if it's five years old Do they still have the doors that have the pressure sensors that you step on to open them up?
That's always fascinating
Actually, I couldn't tell because they were very squishy anyway.
Do they still have the icy machines?
No, they didn't have an icy machine.
Everybody has icy machines now.
I did, however, go to the opening of a 7-Eleven.
Yeah?
And they gave out free Slurpees.
Good times.
All right, going to the chat room from other comments on Loki's rants and this whole story.
Spazinator PC says, Download only is risky.
Look at what I went through with Sony and my videos.
Kind of referencing how his PlayStations will break or he'll lose the license to his videos.
And he's had this huge collection.
It's just a big pain in the butt.
Uni in our chat room says, I rather want a physical copy of the game.
It's all about the gratification.
And I agree with that, too.
There is...
What happens to game collectors if things go digital only?
DarkSakura, I imagine that's got to piss you off to no end because you and Dan are so into collecting that if everything goes digital, it's like, great, what do I have to show for it?
Bits and bytes.
Great, where am I going to get a job?
Because there goes the need for your manuals for production material.
It's pissing me off.
Well, let me put it this way.
A lot of this stuff I think already is digital as far as Xbox Live Arcade, Xbox Indie Games, PlayStation Network, all that stuff.
There's a lot of digital content out there already.
I think if you're going to see anything in the new consoles, it's probably going to be some sort of actual cloud streaming as well where you may have the option to stream your game or whatever.
Instead of a demo, you get a timed demo of the actual full game and get to play that.
You mean what they're doing now on PlayStation Plus?
or you can actually have games on demand almost where you actually rent them and play them that way because that way the publisher still gets a kickback and it's all trackable and it's win-win gamers get to try a game and the publishers get paid
DarkSakura.com
It does this thing where the cursor will freeze and it's seriously pissing me off.
I actually got Bubble Bobble for iPhone.
Not Bubble Bobble.
Puzzle Bobble.
Best move.
I've been playing the crap out of it.
Because if there's a puzzle game that I think I love almost as much as P.O.P.O., it's Puzzle Bobble.
How does that work with the iOS touch?
Do you just kind of touch on the grid where you want the bubble to fly?
You drag your finger across.
But it kind of sucks if you've accidentally tapped it.
And then, oh shoot, I sent the bubble out.
But so far it's not like super hard.
I've gotten like a gold star on every level but one.
And I've beaten the first two areas.
So...
I've played that.
I've played WoW.
I really haven't done a lot of playing of much of anything else though just because I've been hurting.
I was going to start Skyrim but I'd really rather play it on PC.
You should go check out how Alan's modded his all out.
He's made the inventory screens usable.
It's pretty awesome.
Cool.
That's one of the nice things about having it on PC, I think.
But I'm still loyal to my PS3 because I like to sit my big butt on the couch and have my controller.
And Dan's lusting out for the new Borderlands.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Soon.
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
Well, since it's been a few weeks, I played quite a bit, actually.
Of course, there's new DLC for Saints Row III.
I mean, I kind of knew what it was going to be just looking at it.
Basically, the new Saints Row, the third DLC, is Genki Vol.
7.
It's a bunch of side missions or activities, if you will, that you get to play in.
And most of them are just kind of redressed activities from the regular game.
Like, they have an escort mission where you're escorting Genki and then you run people over with your car and that charges up a flamethrower that you...
and DarkSakura.
and SadPanda.
It's just a mayhem mission like they have in the regular game.
So that was neat, I guess.
And then, of course, there was another one that was basically just the regular Professor Genki
and just his normal running through a maze and killing mascots and stuff.
And then the one that was actually really weird that I thought was the most enjoyable out of all of them because it is actually unique was where you're skydiving as a panda through rings, landing on roofs and then chainsawing mascots and then skydiving down some more, bouncing off of balloons and stuff like that.
It's really ridiculous.
But that was kind of fun because it was somewhat unique.
The only thing that's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Two different levels of each activity that they had there.
I mean, they could have added a ton more activities or at least more versions of it that were difficult or increasingly difficult.
But no, they took the easy way out and just pretty much put out the, I don't know, the most minimal version of DLC as possible.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And then, what else?
Oh, I played, I downloaded some indie games.
I actually played one of them, which is DLC Quest.
Oh, yeah, I remember that one.
DLC Quest, it's kind of funny.
I mean, it's more of like, it's something that would be a free Flash game.
I mean, it's a cute little concept, but the game's over in less than an hour.
I mean, but it's a buck, so it's not that bad.
Better than paying $7 for 45 minutes.
So, it was alright.
I mean, I'd recommend it if you want to check it out.
But that's kind of the problem with indie games.
There's a lot of cool concepts on there, but when you go and play them, they're really short.
And it's just, I don't know, it's kind of disappointing that it's not a full-fledged game.
And then, let's see, what else did I play?
Oh, of course, tons of Skyrim.
I'm already...
God, I don't even know.
Probably 120 hours into the game already.
Level 54, although once I glitch out the Ogma Infinium, that'll be level 81 soon enough.
And let's see what else.
Did I do anything fun in Skyrim?
I don't know.
The game's getting more glitchy, as I mentioned before.
I'm having texture problems now where it's not drawing the proper textures on things and all sorts of weird stuff happening.
But there's a new patch coming in really soon for Skyrim, right?
I don't think it's going to fix it.
Every patch makes things worse, okay?
I'm telling you.
So we'll see.
At least that patch, though, the very least, that is going to fix the Blood on Ice mission, the one that's all fucked up for me right now.
So I'm glad that that's going to be fixed soon.
And then, of course, Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
I'm playing lots of that and kicking ass.
Nice.
All right.
Quickly, my gaming week, because there really hasn't been a whole lot I've been playing this week outside of WoW.
There's not a lot of World of Warcraft this week.
Hey, you know what?
That's what I've been into.
There's not a lot of old games I've really gone back to visit, although we did manage to get a copy of Toy Story Midway Mania on the Wii.
Because, you know, I love Disneyland.
I love the rides and all that stuff.
So Midway Mania is one of my favorite rides.
So I was like, what the heck?
Let's just check this out and see what it's like.
And it's...
Okay, yeah, they try to emulate the ride by basically you point the Wiimote at the screen, you hit A and try to hit the targets, but as you can imagine, it's pretty basic.
Did you play it in 3D?
No, I heard you could.
It's supposed to come with glasses.
No, I had a used one, so maybe they didn't have it.
So, I don't know.
I guess I'll have to... What are they?
Are they the red-blue or are they the polarized ones?
I don't know.
I think it's red-blue.
I wonder if it's kind of like the Ride, which uses the polarized ones.
I don't know.
No, it's not like... Or maybe if I steal a copy from the Ride, maybe it'll work at home.
No, you don't have a TV that supports polarized classes.
It's either red-blue or the cyan-purple stuff.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Or cyan-green.
It's probably, you know, it's not going to really change my opinion on the game.
They've tried to do some cute stuff with, like, you know, collecting stickers.
And, you know, all the levels are not quite the same that they are in the ride itself.
You feel a lot of influence from achievements and that whole thing.
You know, you've got to score so many points on a stage.
But everything's relatively easy.
But you have to remember, it's a Disney game.
It's more geared towards kids.
I bet it would be kind of fun to bring out at a party, especially with my friends that love Disneyland.
Let's say DarkSakura, myself, and maybe a couple of other Disney-loving friends got together and did some drinking.
This game might be fun.
Anything's fun with drinking.
Exactly.
You know what game would be fun with drinking?
What?
Is the Kinect Disneyland Adventures, I think would be fun.
I totally want that game still.
I've heard it's pretty good.
I don't have it myself, but I have some friends who have it.
It's surprisingly not as bad as you'd think.
There's also that other one that they're doing.
Was it the Kinect Rush Disney Pixar Adventure?
I hadn't heard of that, no It's coming out in March Is that similar to the Disneyland Adventures?
Sort of California Adventures maybe?
No, it's all Pixar movies But they have like the Incredibles and stuff in there and Ratatouille I want to see WALL-E's in there too, which is kind of cool Very cool
All right, well, otherwise, that's really the only new game I've been playing this week.
Keep in mind, next week, I have Coming to My House Tuesday, Final Fantasy XIII 2, and Soul Calibur V. So it's going to be a busy week next week.
I haven't finished XIII, so you know what?
I'm holding off on it.
You know what?
I never completely finished it either, but I'm not going to.
I'm worried that's going to stop a lot of people from playing it.
But you know what?
Just go watch the spoiler video online.
I already know what the spoiler is, but I still want to finish the game.
All right.
Well, Soul Calibur V is coming out this week, and believe it or not, we know somebody who's been able to get their hands on it already, and we're going to call him right now, and he's going to come on and talk to us a little bit about Soul Calibur V. And it's my buddy from the one and only Horde House.
Extifer should hopefully be on the line.
Hello?
Hello?
Is this Extifer?
Hello?
Xtifer, SoulCalibur V
This is true.
All right.
Now, I don't know how you did that, but I'm not going to ask questions.
But OK, so you had to play Soul Calibur 5.
So first off, now, I think our listeners have to remember you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?
You play a lot of WoW, but you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?
Not usually.
I got a PS3 last year, and I played through Uncharted 2, and I have a few fighting games.
Well, a couple of fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 4.
So I've been getting down with console games lately.
You're getting jiggy with it?
You're getting jiggy with the consoles?
I guess.
Yeah.
Have you ever played a Soul Calibur game in your life?
Yes.
I played... Well, I actually played the original Soul Blade, which I guess was Soul Edge in Japan.
And...
I did play that when it came out on the PlayStation years and years and years ago.
And then I played Soul Calibur 2 when I actually lived with you.
Because I remember you got the GameCube version with Link.
Yep, yep, good times.
So I do remember playing that, but that was the last time I ever played any kind of Soul Calibur game was your copy of Soul Calibur 2.
Well, you know what you're saying isn't different from a lot of people.
A lot of people missed Soul Calibur 3 because it was kind of late in the PlayStation 2 lifespan, and if I remember right, it was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so it never came out to the other consoles.
Then Soul Calibur 4, some people saw Darth Vader and Yoda on the box and were like, no thank you.
Although I think Soul Calibur 4 wasn't bad.
I like all the Soul Calibur games.
Alright, so here we are, Soul Calibur 5.
So tell us a little bit about the game.
Yeah, I was lucky enough to get a collector's edition, and I didn't really know what to expect, so I started playing with the story mode, which, I don't know what it is about fighting games and story modes, but they're all lame.
They all, like, I think that the story mode is kind of cheap.
All of the cutscenes are like little, you know, comic book pictures.
And you just see little blurbs of what's going on, you know.
And they do have voice acting accompanying it.
But who plays fighting games for the stories?
Right.
Who plays fighting games?
And I'm going to get emails from angry fighting game fans.
I do.
But then again, Street Fighter 4 had a really cool story mode and had that little anime thing that went along with it too.
So it was actually really immersive and I've always liked the Street Fighter stories.
But Soul Calibur 5 gave you comic book and bad acting.
Yeah, well, it wasn't that it was bad acting.
It just felt kind of cheap.
But they do have cutscenes.
Well, animated cutscenes.
They're kind of few, and you blink and you miss them.
But in terms of the fighting portion of the game, I love it.
I think it's...
I was half thinking when I hit up, I'm gonna jump
And so when I didn't, I'm like, oh god, this is 3D, right?
I'm not used to that.
I'm more used to the 2D fighting style.
So it was kind of disorienting for me, but that's just a personal thing.
But I really think the graphics and the way the fighting works and everything, you kind of ease into it.
And I think that Soul Calibur is kind of user-friendly.
When it comes to fighting, I think it's a really good game to be introduced to if you haven't ever done any 3D fighting games before.
Was there a tutorial or something?
No, there's no... Well, there is a training mode and they kind of hold your hand through combos and all that stuff.
But it's just in terms of...
I don't know, it just felt really intuitive.
Every move that you make feels like a special move because it all has flashy graphics and everything.
It's aesthetically pleasing, I guess, is what I'm trying to get at.
Now, I know you had a minute to play around with the create your own character mode, which has been a popular part of Soul Calibur since the third one.
What did you think of create a character mode?
Oh, I love it.
I think it's really good.
They have a ton of options that you can do.
I made a black chick and I named her Rob.
Oh, thank you.
After you, because you're a black chick.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I appreciate it.
Yeah.
And you can make her special moves have like a little aura and make that aura a color, and I made it purple just for you.
Oh, like Tinky Winky.
I appreciate that.
Oh, no problem.
Whatever.
I don't get that.
But...
Yeah, it's really cool.
Then I brought it over to my brother-in-laws and he was able to make a character that looks a lot like Cole from what's it, Infamous?
And my sister made a character that I can't quite describe.
She looks like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica but with like a monk's outfit on and like some kind of
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
No, because the game isn't really out yet.
I tried to go online, but it said nobody's playing the game or whatever.
It didn't let me connect to anybody.
So I didn't really get to experience the online element to the game.
But I'm sure that it has a nice user interface.
So there's that.
Okay.
It has a nice interface.
I appreciate that.
Yeah, exactly.
So anything else that the OLR listeners should know about Soul Calibur V before it comes out this week?
I think that it's a good game.
I mean, if you like fighting games and you like 3D fighting games in particular, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
I think that from what I hear, I read a few reviews on it, and they seem to think that it's improved since Soul Calibur 4.
I guess there were some little buggy issues that...
They say that it's improved on, but they also kind of echo my opinion that the single player story mode is kind of cheap, but whatever.
It's a fighting game.
You don't play for the story mode.
No, you just want to wrestle.
That's why we play fighting games.
Sometimes you just want to wrestle.
Exactly.
Well, Extrovert, I gotta let you go so we can get to some gaming news, but thank you for coming on and talking about Soul Calibur 5.
What would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?
I would give it... Can I do .5?
Sure.
I'll do 8.5.
How about that?
Good, good.
Because we have to always have that arbitrary score for no particular reason.
And quickly, before we let you go, is there anything you want to plug?
Uh... Somebody's butt?
Well, we hope this show will help you in accomplishing that.
Oh, okay.
I'm sure this show will help me with that.
Alright, bye, Extrofer!
Okay, bye.
So our local team isn't even in it anyway, so whatever.
And yeah, so we'll be here.
And throughout, I don't see any weeks off coming up.
Do you have any more cheesecake dates, DarkSakura, that I need to be aware of?
No.
All right.
Excuse me.
Let's get into some gaming news then.
Loki.
Alright, let's start off with talking about some ridiculous rumors regarding the Xbox Lube.
And, of course, the rumor is that apparently the new system will launch on holiday 2013.
And it's going to launch with a new GPU that's going to be put out by ATI or AMD, I guess, at this point.
It's, um, I guess part of the AMD 6000 series, um, which is roughly about 20% more performance power than the Wii U, at least what the Wii U is spec'd at right now.
And also, um, apparently it is, uh...
We're gonna tape two of them together!
Call it a Wii.
So yeah, it's going to support DirectX or the Radeon HD 6670, which is what this chip is going to be sort of based on.
It supports DirectX 11, which is going to look nice.
1080p HD multi-display output, 3D, and a bunch of other fun stuff.
I mean, and that's what it's assumed as right now, what they're going to be using.
I guess they're already manufacturing the chips for it, so...
We'll see.
I mean, it's all rumors, so we won't know until they officially announce it.
Which, they could announce a new systems coming.
Do rumors like this really even matter?
Because the whole, like, the Xbox will be, whatever it's called, will be more powerful.
Duh!
It's just all potential.
This just basically says potential.
I mean, however they use that, it's hard to say.
I mean, and even the chips that are in the Xbox 360 right now, compared to today's standards, are not powerful at all.
But it's just how they use it.
So it's, I mean, it's hard to say what it will look like.
I'm sure it'll look nice.
But also I think a lot of it has to do with when you put the specs out there then your competition can see it and they know how to one-up you.
So one reason I would think that Microsoft may not want to put it out there this year is that they don't want Sony to know what's going in there because then Sony will just do whatever they have to do to one-up it.
I can still do that anyways.
An inside source.
They're going to put the most powerful GPU, CPU that they can in the system and still make it cost effective for the consumer.
That's what they're going to do.
I mean, they're not going to... They're going to put an old... The Intel, was it?
Accelerator Graphics Card 500 or whatever it is.
All right, moving on to games that are going to be coming out a lot sooner than whatever the next Xbox is.
Resident Evil Revelations.
There was a couple news stories going around about it this week.
One, the demo is out.
I didn't mention it during my gaming week because I don't like to review demos, but I did download the demo for Resident Evil Revelations.
I thought it was interesting because on the 3DS, when you download the demo, or at least this one, it says uses left 30.
Jumping Flash
Really?
I played the demo of Jumping Flash for weeks several times a day because it was so freaking fun and I couldn't afford the game at the time.
Alan wants to comment.
I played the Bayonetta demo at least two dozen times.
Final Fantasy VIII Demo
I would say maybe the demo for Parappa the Rapper.
Yes.
I played that a bunch, too.
And the Um Jambalami one.
Oh.
I played that a bunch, too.
Okay, okay.
Well, anyway, look, I don't think Resident Evil Revelations is going to be one of those games.
Maybe, I don't know, maybe for you it will be, whatever.
I played it, and I was like, this is kind of neat.
I like the 3D effects, and it's cool.
It's got that scary...
Resident Evil S kind of like the older games had kind of feels a lot more like that but I'm going to be honest what do they want for this game new they wanted what 50 bucks at one point and then they dropped it down to 40 right yes yeah I don't think I don't personally I'm not into the series enough where I can justify 40 bucks I know there are some people that will and that's cool I don't think they're going to be terribly disappointed but uh just you know not so much for me
But those that are getting on this game early are going to get something that's a bit of a blessing and a curse.
And there's a lot of lulls going around the internet about that this week.
I mean, this is on the front page of Yahoo.
I saw this.
It's the fact that the Resident Evil Revelations box art is spelled wrong.
That was the only review caught.
on the side.
Well, Capcom put out a statement.
It has come to our attention that there was a misspelling on the Resident Evil Revelations packaging.
We apologize for the mistake, which will be corrected for subsequent productions of the game.
It makes it sound like the first printing, because the first printing has to already be out there.
It's hitting shelves on the 7th, right?
Oh, Capcom, you're so funny with your printing.
Remember way back when Okami came out and there was an IGN watermark on it?
Oh yeah, oh god, that was funny.
They had to recall them all or something, or no, they had to substitute box art.
And you know what, I didn't even own the game and I got to substitute box art.
Well, they're going to do something similar for this.
They are saying that they might actually be, I guess, they're going to work on a solution to provide affected customers with the correct packaging.
But in my mind, I'm thinking, the value of the misspelled ones just shot like way up.
Nah, you don't think?
I beg to differ with Loki.
Monopoly.
And I'm thinking like baseball cards that are spelled wrong.
No, in reference to a game.
Monopoly.
There was a release of Monopoly on the Sega Master System that had it Monospace Poly.
But was that in the game or on the box art?
On the box art.
On the cartridge.
Nice.
And it's a collector's item.
but here's the thing and this is the only thing I can think of where I do somewhat agree with Loki like I agree with you with the classic stuff but then Loki I'm thinking that stuff is really easy to fake in this day and age with the types of color printers we have you know like how easy would that there's ways around it there are ways to find if it's a fake
Okay.
Because, okay, first of all, you'd be dealing with the pound of paper that they use.
You would be dealing with their print resolutions.
You would be dealing with, you can actually sometimes tell what type of printer was used for something just by looking with a, what's it called, a loop at the print itself.
Okay.
Yeah, Amiga777 in our chatroom says, I hear that eBay is lighting up with high prices for the misspelled ones.
Be careful with something like eBay.
Just remember, go back a few episodes.
Excuse me, Alan got me a birthday present game on eBay that ended up coming from China, and it was the wrong damn game.
He bought me Child of Eden, and we ended up getting a copy of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I haven't forgotten about you guys and I did have a story here we already mentioned it though because of the four gigabyte cartridge that Resident Evil Revelations uses as opposed to the two gigabyte cartridge they were trying to justify a $50 price tag well that didn't last they did officially drop it to $40 but you may think about well if you want to play it with the Circle Pad Pro you're gonna have to dump an extra $20 on it anyway so it's really not that cheap
Oh, cool.
I saved myself $60.
Would you download it or something?
No, I'm just not going to play it.
Oh, okay.
Anyhow, all right.
Let's move on.
DarkSakura.
Well, I never can pronounce the name of this company, right?
Is it Asus or Asus or Asus?
Asus?
Like Loki's laptop?
Asus.
Asus.
I think most people say Asus, but I like Asus.
at any rate, there is a note that there is a PC Connect SKU going to be coming out for an Asus laptop it's going to apparently have a built-in Kinect sensor
It's just licensed out by Microsoft.
They're not doing the, I guess, the creation of the item itself.
But Microsoft did confirm that the laptops are going to have Kinect's functionality built in.
And of course, we know the standalone PC Kinect is going to be out on February 1st for $249.
Yeah.
I'm not surprised.
I think they already said that they're going to be trying to integrate that in the PCs.
I mean, it makes sense.
You're not going to have just a separate Kinect sensor that's going to be separate from the laptop.
Of course, it's going to be integrated.
It makes sense.
See, honestly, something like that would be great for me when too much typing starts to hurt after a while.
You know, air type.
That would just be pretty awesome.
But...
I mean, I guess for a laptop, I don't know how it would make as much sense as having something like that for a PC.
Because, you know, a lot of people do PC gaming and we have a PC hooked up to our TV in the front room.
Something like that would be a good idea.
I just don't see exactly how it would work for a laptop unless it's for like virtual keyboard and disabled services.
So...
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of funny, the Wii U getting a brand new network to go along with it, which is good.
I mean, because right now what they've got for, I don't even know what you really call it, was it Wi-Fi Connect or something like that, which...
Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection
This was kind of leaked out a little bit early with the new Final Fantasy The Rhythm cover.
It actually had that logo on there.
And then, of course, Nintendo was talking a little bit about it as part of an investor presentation.
And some of the things that are going to be coming with the Nintendo Network, communities of Mario Kart 7 players.
So they're going to have some sort of community feature with that.
Well, Mario Kart 7 already has communities in it.
So are they expanding that?
RockBand has DLC.
Yeah, for the Wii, but not like on the 3DS and the DS and stuff like that.
Alright, whatever.
Alright.
Okay.
Preparing for digital distribution of packaged software.
So, I mean, they're going to have some downloadable games, I guess.
And the introduction of personal accounts for the Wii U. Which, in my opinion, is the only actual new news in here.
Yeah.
Yes, I understand that now Nintendo is saying they can sell full games online or whatever, but virtual console is full games.
The 3DS shot is just bigger full games.
Fantastic that you can sell full games online.
Welcome to 10 years ago for everybody else.
I mean, it's like, come on.
Where the fuck have you been, Nintendo?
But yay for them finally catching up because I would like to see a Nintendo console that understands online.
So that would be nice.
But yeah, the fact that they are finally doing this whole personal accounts and maybe that means no more friend code, I hope.
We'll see.
I would hope not.
I don't like friend codes, sir.
Who does?
Does anyone like friend codes?
I don't like friends.
No.
It was an overrated TV show, I agree.
I really don't like that show.
Except I always liked when What's-Her-Face's hair would frizz out because it totally reminded me of going back to Alabama.
Alright, so Nintendo Network.
I know we've had investor information, but when do we get the real information?
Have they said anything about that or no?
Nope.
Soon.
E3, right?
Probably.
Hey, guess what, guys?
We have this wonderful technology that we're going to implement.
It's called patching our games.
Downloadable content.
It's like getting a new game, but you're downloading extra pieces.
Now I know this is totally revolutionary.
And you only have to pay 100 Mario coins to unlock the online features.
This thing that we're going to call the Wi-Fi Pass.
You need to play... The play is Luigi.
No, they should really... I think that the online... Are you too lazy to walk?
Do you need to buy extra play coins so you can unlock stationary and swap notes?
That's DLC Quest.
Watch it happen.
DLC Quest.
The first DLC you buy is the ability to walk left.
and Animations.
And then I love it, the sexy outfit DLC that you can get in DLC Quest.
Add sexy outfits to everybody in the game.
So bikinis all around.
Fun.
Good times.
Alright, well let's move on and talk about Gaikai.
You know, Gaikai is one of those online streaming networks, kind of like OnLive and so forth.
Guy Kai is going to be doing full game streaming services on the various gaming and entertainment websites that they will be working with.
Now, right now, they only do demos.
That's the difference.
Right now, Guy Kai specializes in demos, but they are going to be doing full game streaming services.
Now, here's the thing.
One of those partners involved is Facebook, which if you might have heard of it, it's a pretty popular website.
Also, Gaikai is supposed to be doing stuff with YouTube, Best Buy, Walmart, and even directly with the publishers, EA and Ubisoft.
Full game streaming is supposed to go about 90 days after the Facebook version begins, which is going to be very soon.
Gaikai does compete with OnLive, but the folks behind Gaikai, including the head Dave Perry, says that one of the big differences between the two companies is they have to modify the game, they have to get the source code to the game, Gaikai does not require modification of the game.
So, very interesting.
That could be integrated with Facebook soon.
Especially because Facebook games are still kind of a big thing.
There's a lot that people play.
I've heard that a lot of them are dying.
There's not nearly as many farmers in Farmville as there were some time ago.
But I will admit, as terrible as they are, I can't stop playing the Press Your Luck.
There's a new Press Your Luck game on Facebook.
DarkSakura
I'm judging you, Rob.
Oh, God.
And I got really tired of block.
They try too much.
A lot of those Facebook games try way too hard to get your money.
If they wanted to be smart, they would actually look at Tiny Tower.
I think it's a lot more subtle about it.
Certainly, it's there, and they're not shy about it, but it's not in your face all the freaking time.
So, it's just...
Plus the game show games that I play kind of do that too.
I play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire as well and it's like you are out of shows.
Do you want to buy more shows for the day?
But I don't need to play more than once a day.
I don't know.
That's just me.
so it would be interesting though if like full on streaming games more powerful stuff was coming to Facebook like cause some of the you know especially games like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and Press Your Luck and the stuff I'm playing don't really have that great animations and SimSocial for like the week I was playing it before I blocked it you know the animation's kinda old but imagine if they could have a game like SimSocial with Sims 3 graphical quality to it that actually ran pretty smoothly Gaikai could bring that couldn't it?
Maybe?
I mean, I know we're talking about streaming, I don't know, Arkham City and things that are already out there on the PC and stuff, but couldn't Facebook games be developed with this in mind?
That'd be very interesting.
So, anyhow.
Well, anything is possible.
That's true.
All right, moving on.
Well, Quarrel Xbox Live Arcade found what the filter is.
Coral is one of those word games.
And if you play it with the parental filters on, there are a bunch of words that you can't play.
On the list is help, train, start, dice, and god.
Of course, balls and shaft are not allowed.
And then the offensive words are not allowed, like arse, shit.
Fuck.
Cock.
But now I heard that see you next Tuesday was allowed.
Somehow was slipping through.
Whereas all these other words are blocked.
The mother of all curse words is not.
The source.
Literally, the source of all your cursing.
You can say it.
You know, I actually don't like that word, but it is a funny word.
What, cunt?
Yeah.
There's basically the other words that...
Well, I cunt understand what the problem is.
In other words, it's not allowed to skid and poop and bung and hung and dice.
Oh, great.
Now it's sounding like Extifer's back on the show.
Bleached asshole.
I was going to suggest that to him for that little issue he posted about
Help!
Help!
And Hung!
Huh.
You can't talk about having to poop.
You can't start anything.
You can't roll the dice.
Gamers are discriminating against tabletop gamers because they don't let dice.
I'm offended.
They are discriminating against my people.
But here, this is the, okay, to me, this is the hilarious thing about this story.
And trains.
So we find, hey, my dad was a conductor for the railroad.
That's offensive.
That is offensive.
You can't say train on Xbox Live Arcade.
But yet, this is the hilarious thing to me, is that Microsoft bans all these words for whatever reason, like maybe, I don't know, whatever.
They're banned.
Listen, the Xbox 360 does not start.
All I have to do is turn on my headset.
and all I'll hear on Xbox Live while I'm probably playing Quarrel, Nice word, fag.
This game is gay.
Why are you playing this faggy gay game?
Because I saw the game blowing some guy in the backyard.
Well, you're playing this game too.
Nice move, fag.
Ain't you playing better words?
The quote from Gary Penn with Denki, the developer,
Coral uses the Collins Official Scrabble Dictionary comprising over 110,000 words up to 8 letters in length including a huge collection of words deemed offensive
It's a really shitty band.
It's a really shitty band.
Unless you're, you know, maybe it's a sex move or something.
The train.
Choo-choo.
It's a move and fisting.
You don't know what a train is?
No.
Rob's looking it up, too.
Wait, you're talking about the human centipede stuff, aren't you?
No, no, no.
My friend just bought that movie.
She loves that movie.
Something to that effect.
Yes, a train is something to that effect.
Except maybe not sewing someone's ass to their face.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Microsoft has forced Dance Central to remove one of their songs.
I can't believe it.
This song is deemed way too offensive.
She fucking said train.
That's offensive.
Ride the train?
You know that's a euphemism for big fat cock.
Listen to her.
She's all, come on, ride the big fat cock.
Lord.
See, I was thinking it was maybe a euphemism for fisting.
Rob just turned red.
Who are you having sex with, Muppets?
Gosh, okay.
Allow me to enlighten you to what a train is.
A group of guys stand in line outside of a room one by one and they enter a room to have sex with one girl inside.
The line must have at least seven guys to be qualified as a train.
That is a train.
What does that make her?
The caboose?
Well, now we understand why the game has banned the word train.
Orange Sons Radio got that word banned.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Anyhow.
Or.
Or.
You know what?
I'm leaving the room.
You guys are dirty.
Or it would be a line of men having intercourse connected by penis to ass.
The conductor or man in the back controls the speed while the front controls the direction of the train.
As one ejaculates, he will then exit the train.
We involve train sounds.
Is it kind of like this?
I'm not sure.
S to S. S to S.
What the hell is... Ass to Ass.
Requiem for a Dream.
Oh.
Ass to Ass.
Alright.
Anyways.
Thank you, Urban Dictionary.
You're welcome.
Alright.
I like how I said you're welcome as if I'm Urban Dictionary.
Alright, let's move on.
Let's stop being 12 and move on to...
Travel around the world and check out what the trains bring into a game store near you as we look at some release dates.
Lots of good stuff this week, actually.
The only releases for this month that are worth picking up.
Final Fantasy XIII 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
Also in a collector's edition if you want to buy the game with the...
Soul Calibur V on PS3 and Xbox 360 Never Dead on PS3 and Xbox 360
And that's actually it.
And then nothing.
There you go.
I thought we might add, there was, I think at one point there was Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 3D for the 3DS, but that's been delayed again.
I see.
3D balls were considered offensive.
It took extra time to render the balls.
All right.
They had to pay special attention to the balls.
Or else somebody might get offended.
Alright, moving on.
Let's check out what's coming out in Japan.
We'll start with the Xbox 360.
Japan finally gets Dragon Age 2.
So you can say meh just like the rest of us.
On February 2nd, 2012 is when Dragon Age 2 finally gets to Japan.
Also coming to Japan on February 2nd, Never Dead and Soul Calibur V obviously is released here this week and it looks like it's timed pretty well to actually be released in Japan at the same time.
Coming to the PlayStation 3, a lot of the same stuff, Dragon Age 2, Never Dead, Soul Calibur V But you also get Gran Turismo 5 Spec 2012 I'm not sure exactly what this is, but I want to say this is probably similar I think you were talking about this on the show, Loki They were going to put out a Gran Turismo 5 that came with a bunch of download content It came with $20 worth of download content and the Spec 2012 update
They are saying that this new update does the simplified cockpit view.
It's a spec 2012 update.
They're just calling something different in there.
Alright, got it.
So that's what Japan is getting.
Spec 2.0 is what they're calling it.
So Japan gets that, hooray.
The Vita is out in Japan, and out this week on the Vita is Ragnarok Odyssey.
Comes out from Gung Ho, and I believe, if I'm not mistaken, this is the Ragnarok online game on the Vita, I think.
Although I don't know if it's specific...
Oh no, I think this is different.
Ragnarok Odyssey pits gamers against giants from Norse myths.
So I don't think that's it, but it's like more of an action game.
I saw the name and I thought maybe, maybe.
All right.
Anyhow.
Let's see.
Coming out on other systems.
Like a train.
That's just never going to die.
I'm trying to see if anything's coming out on the Wii.
It's coming out.
On the 3DS, Fishing 3D from D3.
Ooh, Fishing 3D.
It's almost like the real thing, just as boring.
And lastly, that's it.
I guess I could check the PSP real quick.
How about it?
Photo Kano.
Okay.
On the 30th in the UK, January 30th, we have Call of Cthulhu, The Wasted Land.
Call of Cthulhu.
And now I have to go to February because this thing's set up really bizarre.
and in February on the 1st we have Rhythm Party on the 2nd we have Pixel Junk Eden and on the 3rd Final Fantasy 13-2 Metal Gear Solid HD Collection Never Dead and Soul Calibur V
Shane knows a lot about the Vita and what's going on and says that Ragnarok Odyssey is partially the people that did Ragnarok Online.
So it's not Ragnarok Online, but it's like a lot of the same people making a new thing.
So there you go.
Just thought you'd want to know.
All right, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.
So let's go to Loki.
It's like Ragnarok Wi-Fi ad hoc.
Yes, it's just like that.
With a 3G connection provided by AT&T, yes.
Yes.
Well, in Japan, it would be something else.
So, yeah, the Vita's getting hacked, as usual.
But it's not exactly the Vita getting hacked.
It's more of the PlayStation 3 getting hacked and the Vita kind of benefiting from said hack.
Of course, with the power of custom firmwares on the PlayStation 3, and this has been something that they did with the PSP before, where they added more games supported through remote play.
They have done the same with the Vita.
Now you can support more games via remote play on the Vita, including Batman Arkham Asylum, Battlefield 3, Alice in Madness Returns, Mortal Kombat, and Red Dead Redemption.
However, the games display a hefty amount of input lag.
Also, they had some extra games that they're going to be supporting via remote play, including Killzone 3, but those are not yet available.
I guess not yet supported but it looks like if I remember correctly the PSP there were a lot of games that didn't have remote play enabled but with hacks were able to get remote play enabled on those and they actually worked just fine so there may be more games beyond just those five that they will work and work well so they have videos online too if you want to
check them out um I mean I think it'd be pretty awesome play Battlefield 3 on the Vita or you know Red Dead I didn't even think about that the PSP and the PlayStation 3 already have similar connectivity you know yes it's one of the most underlooked features in the PSP so the Vita ought to kick it up and you should be able to play like PS3 games streaming right yes and especially since the controls will be nice instead of having to worry about before we're
Oh, I only have one analog stick.
Now you have dual analog.
And to be honest, they should be supporting the L2R2 just by tapping a portion of the back touch panel.
And then you have pretty much full compatibility with the dual shock controls.
Assuming that you're not going to run into input lag that's going to really affect your game, I don't see why more games aren't supporting this.
Alright, well, I'm hoping to see more of this kind of technology coming to the Vita, because I gotta say, if I could play, like, Final Fantasy XIII too, on my Vita, like, while I'm in bed, like, you know, just do a little bit of the grinding in my bedroom...
I meant experience grinding, you sick perv.
Stop laughing over there, DarkSakura.
You certainly are experienced, huh?
Bitch.
All right.
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.
I would love to do that.
Like, that would be so awesome.
Like, it's almost like a... I mean...
Isn't the Wii U's whole point kind of moot if the PlayStation can do that same thing?
Sort of.
Sort of, except for the fact that it would be way more expensive on the PlayStation 3, I'm sure.
Alpha Cananagram wants to make a good point, though.
The thing is, PS3 is Wi-Fi G, not Wi-Fi N, so it's going to suck.
Yes, but at the same time, who's to say the next system's not going to be... I'd assume the next system's going to be Wi-Fi in.
Are you already thinking about Vita 2?
No, I'm talking about the... Oh, I'm sorry, the PS3.
That's a good point.
I don't know if the Vita is in.
I think it might be.
It just occurred to me.
There's another game that I played today.
But we're bringing it up.
I played with the Sony tablet.
Oh?
Was it called the Tablet S?
And it has PlayStation games on it.
But I was playing the Uncharted pinball game today.
Oh, okay.
But I was thinking about that, you know, if they've got PlayStation, I think it said some PS2 games too on their little tablet, then it actually seems to, you know, that it wouldn't be that hard for them to have the Vita that played, you know, your PS3 games.
Alpha Cananigram has another great suggestion here.
They need to release an updated PS3 or some sort of dongle to upgrade the Wi-Fi N for the Vita's Wi-Fi N. And Dongle, he's changed his name, is confirming the Vita does have an N in it.
To be honest, you could do that with a Wi-Fi N bridge.
You could, you know...
Upgrade your connection or have a router that's Wi-Fi and connect physically to your PS3 and then have it stream from there.
Next system, obviously going to be N. Probably will be able to support a lot more streaming, especially if you're going to be downloading games and stuff.
That could be kind of cool.
You could see a lot of new functionality with the Vita with that.
Although by the time that system comes out, the Vita could be dead in the water already.
Let's hope not.
Alright, well let's move on to another story here I have on THQ, of course the makers of Saints Row, right?
Apparently it's going to be refocusing a bit over THQ.
First, I should say this, there were some crazy ass rumors this week that THQ was going to just fucking fold.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and somebody else will pick up the license, I'm sure.
But anyway, UFC, Darksiders, Company of Heroes, Insane, Saints Row, Warhammer 40K and so on.
These are all still in production and there will be that going forward.
They have a ton of fucking titles coming out.
I mean, I'm not surprised that they're... I mean, look at the titles that are coming out from THQ.
They have the fucking South Park RPG game that's coming out at the end of the year.
I mean...
They've got plenty of big titles.
They're on par with EA and Activision.
They're easily one of the top three.
Hell, even First Party can't really top... First Party doesn't have a lot of titles coming out anymore.
Yeah, they're not going anywhere.
I mean, if you're going to see another company die, it's going to be like Konami or maybe even like Capcom.
One of the smaller guys like D3.
I could see them folding.
South Peak, they could have very well already folded.
Yeah, it's going to be one of those.
It's not going to be THQ.
They're not going to just all of a sudden get bought out.
They've got a ton of properties.
Thanks for watching!
I thought one of those tablets did quite well.
Was that the first you draw on the Wii?
But then when they tried to kind of put it everywhere, it didn't do so well, right?
And I don't really know if it did well.
It did all right.
But I'm glad that it's gone because it had potential.
But the problem with that tablet is you didn't have anybody coming on it.
They were saying, oh yeah, Nintendo's going to develop some titles for the UDraw tablet.
If they had done that, then yeah, I would have kicked ass on the Wii.
But since there wasn't a Mario Paint or anything like that on the UDraw, it just died.
No one cares.
Because it's a peripheral that's going to be used for a couple of games, and that's it.
Alright, well, let's take a minute to go down memory lane and think about a time when we weren't so worried about games' financial situations.
We didn't have these tablet things that were coming out and destroying game companies.
It's the classic game of the week.
DarkSakura's gonna dive headfirst into the classic gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey, you kids, better respect.
And you picked a real oldie but goodie tonight, didn't you?
I picked one of my favorite old games.
All right.
And you think after... How many episodes have you done of the Classic Game of the Week now?
It started episode 250, right?
So damn near 200 Classic Games of the Week.
Yeah.
And you're still finding ones you kind of forgot or whatever, just never did before.
Well, and actually this came last night from Dan and I. We were watching...
I didn't know it stood for anything.
is the portmanteau of excellence in dynamics.
I didn't know that.
I remember the name Exidy, though.
Yeah.
So maybe it's Exidi, since it's dynamics.
Anyway, Mousetrap was basically, and everyone's going to say it was a Pac-Man clone.
Well, unlike Zynga, Exidy decided to actually innovate on the genre and throw in a few other twists.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So moving forward, you play as a mouse, and you're being chased by cats, and you are eating up little pieces of cheese, and you can collect bones.
Now, the bones, as opposed to how the power pills worked, you store up your bones, and you activate them at a certain time that you choose.
You can save all of your bones and not use them in that level.
I mean, you have to start over the next level, but still, you don't have to use all your bones.
But you have the bones, you turn into a dog, and the dog bites the cats and sends the cats back into their little places that aren't in the center of the screen.
They are on each side of the screen.
In the center, you have a little area that says, N. And when you go through the N, it actually puts you into one of the four corners at random.
You don't get to control.
Actually, I think there was a way to determine which one, but I think it depended on how you entered the little thing.
So, um... You, uh... Actually, instead of there being four enemies on screen, you had six cats.
And they had point multipliers, 100 for the first, 300 for the second, 500 for the third, 700, 900, and that was it.
Um...
and, of course, it resets every time you use a new bone.
Now, the cats, though, will respawn faster.
As you got through later levels, you also had a hawk that would pop up that would eat both the mouse and the dog, if you were the dog, and the only way to change its direction from going right after you was to go in the infield in the center so that it would just go to a random place.
You also had bonus items that when you got one, the next one would appear.
And your bonus items, they would also be towards the different corners.
There are 1,000 points each and would increase by 200 points for each subsequent prize.
So the last one was 7,200 points.
The items are, there's 32 of them, there's a wedge of Swiss cheese, a paperclip, a safety pin, a key, an apple, a trophy, a candlestick, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, a pair of eyeglasses, a clock, a bottle, a gem, a bugle, a screw, a hammer, a diamond ring, a lightbulb, a sewing needle, a fork, a thimble, a knife, a cocktail glass, a fishbone, a pear, a peanut, a die, a telephone handset, a die with CAF on the faces, I guess that would be like a block, a
A spool of thread, a teacup, and a pistol.
What a mouse needs a pistol for.
And a martini glass and eyeglasses.
I have no freaking clue.
Some of the 80s games had the strangest power-ups in them, though.
I know.
You also get a 10,000 point bonus for clearing the board of all cheese.
And if you end the stage as the dog, you will begin the next stage as the dog.
Which is kind of stupid because the cats don't really appear.
Now here is, I think, the really innovative part of the game.
Are the doors.
and with the doors you had three different colors you had a yellow a red and a blue door that if you press that colored button the door would open and close and my goal every time I played the damn game was to trap the cats
DarkSakura.com
Now, this is not to be confused, as some people are saying in the chat room here.
It's a board game.
Yes, Torment is saying, my mom loved that game.
She would set up for hours playing Mousetrap.
But there was somebody else that says it before that.
Torment didn't just come out and say that.
Somebody said something about the board game in there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and, oh, I can take my time.
Look at you, mouses.
I mean, kitty cats trapped in the little areas.
So there were different ports.
Like I said, I had the Clicovision version, which to me was the most true version, I think.
it had fewer prizes and you could actually had an option to leave out the hawk and the sound effects were a little different but as far as having the doors and everything it was probably the closest to the arcade you could get the Intellivision one actually added an audio warning when the cats were entering the maze but the graphics were blockier and then the Atari 2600 version
I'm looking at the videos now because I want to say I played this one.
And no sound.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
However, now you remember the song Pac-Man Fever, Rob?
Of course I do.
Pac-Man Fever.
Bugner and Garcia.
Well, they also did a song called Mousetrap on the same album.
I did not know that.
And it was made using the sound effects from the game.
A little note on here from the article I'm reading is that when they re-recorded the album in 1999, they could not find the machine.
And so had to use sounds from nature.
Let's see, I actually found it here on the good old YouTube that has everything.
Mousetrap, mousetrap What can I do?
I could turn into a dog if I only had a bone And compress a doggy butt and they would leave me all alone Wow, they do really just sing about the game, don't they?
Well, they do with Pac-Man Fever.
I could block and trap the cats and turn into a mouse again Mousetrap
Rest in peace, by the way.
That guy died last year.
One of them.
There was two of the guys.
One of them died last year.
Anyhow.
But so that's the game.
And again, it was one of my all-time favorites.
And my mother would sit and play this for hours, although her game was Space Fury.
All right.
Classic Game of the Week, folks, is Mousetrap for the ColecoVision or, you know, really it did start in the arcade, so there it is.
I'm going to say if you want to play it at home without MAME, ColecoVision.
All right, that's the way to go.
All right, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week.
We're going to be back.
There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
We have a list list tonight.
We're going to be doing a list list.
Tonight's list list is inspired by Twitter.
There was a listener on Twitter that said you should do this as a topic, and I'm like, okay, we can do that.
So we are going to do a list list.
Alan's going to join us for that.
and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.
You know, if you've never listened to Orange Lounge Radio live, you really should consider it sometime.
Of course, I know some of our listeners are overseas, so if you guys are in Europe, it is really hard to listen to our show unless you have severe insomnia.
So I apologize for that, but that is why we have a podcast.
But for those of you guys who are in the States...
Your excuses are severely numbered.
So we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, of course.
And we do have the chat room.
And when you're not here with us in live chat, you miss fun things like DarkSakura's having a contest right now.
Whoever can guess her bra size gets to buy her a taco.
Now, I'm not sure how there's a winner in that situation.
There's two winners and they're both me.
Because everyone gets to know what a fantastic rack I have.
And I also get a taco.
Can I just put pics on OLR.com?
No.
And then I am kind of wearing a cleavage-y shirt today.
Orangeloungeradio.com, actually.
I keep saying OLR.com.
And my hair is cute.
That's not our site.
What?
And my hair is cute.
You do look cute today.
I put effort into my hair today considering how like shitty I felt mad you were I don't know yeah angsty you were earlier you A you seem like the show has helped you unwind a little bit yes you might be in a bad mood but you're looking good oh yeah yeah pissy bitch gotta be hot alright
All right, we're going to do some rapid-fire news.
Believe it or not, we're not just a video game show about boobies.
Although, don't get me wrong.
Everybody loves boobies.
Loki, boobies?
He gave the big thumbs up.
Great radio.
DarkSakura, boobies?
Yeah.
And I love boobies, too.
Boobies are great.
Is DarkSakura taking a picture of her boobies?
I'm not going to put a picture up.
Oh, okay.
That kind of comes with the radio show territory.
What?
Taking pictures of boobs.
It's just, you know, you eventually devolve into that type of show.
There's the picture.
Oh, see?
You gotta put that on the site.
I am.
Alright, moving on.
Alright.
Let's talk about Skylanders.
Yay, Skylanders.
Your favorite game.
My favorite game.
Hey, you know what?
Here's the thing.
If you can't avoid them, then at least benefit from them.
But that's another story.
Anyways, Skylanders.
So apparently Activision has grabbed the rights to a domain called Skylanders Giants.
So you can probably guess that's probably going to be the next Skylander game or whatever.
So Skylander Giants coming to a store near you.
You want to hear something funny?
So as I mentioned weeks prior that those toys are so hard to find right now that they're going for astronomical prices on auction sites like eBay and Amazon.
Activision, because most companies eventually they will drop the price of their merchandise automatically.
Oh no, no, no, no.
They are raising the price of the merchandise.
Those toys, remember how they used to cost you like eight bucks or whatever?
They're going to cost you one additional dollar to buy that.
That'd be like those Call of Duty map packs selling so well that they're going to charge more money for them.
But guess what?
You stupid fuckers will keep buying them.
And so that's why Skylanders Giants is allowed to exist.
So don't you fucking bitch and complain about your goddamn map packs costing too much because it's all your fucking fault for buying those stupid Skyliner toys.
Why are you so angry?
You're so angry.
Yeah, I'm not fucking angry.
I'll make a quick buck off of those fucking toys.
whatever you know I'm gonna be laughing all the way to the bank uh because you people can't get your hands on those toys uh anyways Capcom has announced Ace Attorney 5 that's gonna be coming out uh
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
and also of course they're going to be doing some HD versions of some of the older Ace Attorney games.
1 through 3 are coming to iOS platforms soon and with refreshed sprites and that fun stuff.
And last but not least, there's a new game coming out on the PlayStation 3 for the Move.
And it's going to allow you to use your PlayStation Move controllers to engage in combat.
Looks almost like that...
that Kinect game that they have coming out from the guys that do Crysis from Crytek very you know Roman combat type stuff but anyways the game's called Quandra Mortis and it's done by the guys that did the fight the lights out so they know a little bit about battle games they also know about games that don't sell well so it's hard to say whether that game will do well or not but
Yeah, and you'll be able to fight against your friends over the PlayStation Network.
Also, if you happen to not want to engage in move combat or multi-move controller combat, you can still use a regular controller as well.
So it's nice to at least have that option in there.
All right, well, moving on to some other rapid-fire news.
I think I need a correct musical background for this because it's one of the greatest theme songs ever.
Hopefully it'll work.
Yeah.
Ah, that's right, I played this song because Muppets DLC is coming to LittleBigPlanet 2!
That's right, Sackboys will meet the Muppets.
This is gonna be so awesome.
Like, I have to admit, I'm so embarrassed because I never really got into LittleBigPlanet 2.
Like, I never just bought it, because I was like, oh, another $60 game right now, I can't do it.
But I love LittleBigPlanet 1, so this might seriously push me over the edge right here.
I've got to get LittleBigPlanet 2, because now...
There's Muppet DLC in it.
It's gonna have 2 new minigames, 5 new levels, a new soundtrack, objects, voices, new trophies, 12 new pins, and a Ralph the Dog costume.
Outstanding.
It's going to cost $5.99, and it actually just came out this week.
Also a new game mechanic is the attractogel.
Now Sackboy can walk on walls and ceilings.
And any object can do the same, thanks to the attractogel.
Amazing.
You know, I haven't played through LittleBigPlanet 2 at all other than the first level or so.
I should probably go back.
Oh, man.
It's just one of those games that unfortunately just came out at a really bad time, so I kind of missed it, but it's such a...
The first one was so, so good.
I can't imagine how the second one is suddenly bad.
Anyhow, rumors going around, big rumors that Wii U might change their name.
Nintendo is seriously considering renaming the Wii U and it has to do with the fact that I guess a lot of people were confused by the 3DS and the fact that the 3DS and the way they're kind of selling it looks so similar to the DS that people think the 3DS is just a souped up DS.
Although I'm kind of like, well, that's what it is, isn't it?
But what...
But whatever.
So Nintendo is very scared about this because maybe it's too similar.
So they're thinking that folks will see Wii U and think it's just the same thing, that they already have one at home.
I don't know how much I'm on board with this, but I don't really care for the name Wii U. But then again, I didn't really like the name Wii, and it kind of grew on everybody.
So those jokes will never get old.
I'm noticing this thread on Destructoid which one of the sites that ran the news story had some comments like for people suggesting a new name and a lot of people are suggesting a lot of the development names like Ultra, Dolphin, whatever but I think honestly the best name I saw in here was Nintendo HD what a what a great name for the console just fucking call it what it is it's Nintendo HD I think that's the best suggestion I saw in there
Loki, you look like you're wanting to comment on this or something.
That sounds fine to me.
That makes sense.
Wii U, do you love the name Wii U?
Do you hope it sticks?
Well, I am very fond of the movie Kung Pao and yes, Wii U does tie into Kung Pao quite a lot.
I am hoping it sticks just because of all the wonderful Kung Pao clips I get to watch.
You should be able to beat him now!
also Nintendo has announced that at their recent online thing that they do with investors one of the other things they talked about not just the Nintendo Network but another little little gem slipped in there a new 2D Mario game that will be released in the next fiscal year meaning before March 2013 that will be on the 3DS
New Super Mario Bros.
Wii
Thanks for watching!
It's a Mario game.
Oh my god.
Just make really fun levels and done.
You don't need to make something brand new every time.
Now, that's not to say that you shouldn't make brand new things because they've had the problem with releasing games that they've changed nothing for ages on, Animal Crossing.
Yeah.
or, you know, it's just like any of the new play control things.
I mean, they should change a little bit, but, you know, it's not to say that the old stuff wasn't good.
Some comments in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com.
Ranma says, no, just call it Nintendo.
The Nintendo, Nintendo.
You know, that's been suggested a lot, and that was even rumored, one of the titles at one point, but the NES was the Nintendo, and I think, I don't know, I just...
I like Nintendo HD or Wii HD.
Just something I like to keep it simple, but that might be too simple.
Call it the Nintendo Money Press because it prints money.
Some other comments in our chatroom at chat.orange.com.
Dongle says, give me true Super Mario World sequel with 2D art in 3D.
Amaya says, I want a good Yoshi's Island sequel.
Well, yeah, Super Mario Bros.
2, Yoshi's Island.
That was one of the best.
No, thank you.
Anyhow, let's move on.
DarkSakura.
Well, we do have a few other things.
It would also be good if I did not have the mailbag pulled up over it.
So how about Street Fighter X Tekken?
There's some interesting news.
And that is a weird picture of Mega Man.
It's Mr. Mega Man.
Mr. Mega Man?
Well, it's technically Mega Man.
He's in the pose from the American box art for the first Mega Man.
And...
That's just weird.
Also, the image of it isn't showing, so I can link it in the chat room.
But it was...
Yeah, bizarre.
And also Pac-Man's in it, which I don't get.
Well, the Pac-Man thing was cool.
Have you seen the trailer with him in action yet?
No.
Pac-Man was in a while.
This is the weird thing.
Pac-Man sounds stupid to me, but wait until you see what they did to Pac-Man.
You're going to say the same thing I did, I bet.
It said with mechanical assistance.
Well, it's a very specific mechanical.
Let her see, because she's a tech fan.
Don't spoil it.
I will throw a cartoon Megan Fox at you.
Alright, let's see.
Ah, here it is.
I hope this isn't some stupid-ass parody or something.
Let's see here.
No!
I hate YouTube advertisements.
Dammit, dammit, dammit.
Alright, hold on.
It's some dude proposing to some chick.
She's not gonna marry you.
What?
What are you saying?
Oh, we're not going to watch this stupid commercial.
We had to get through it.
We had to get through it.
Here we go.
Warning.
The following trailer may contain... God damn it.
It's some... I hate when people take... I don't think that was... I hate when people take the videos... There we go.
It was just on it, Rob.
Sorry, I closed it.
Hold on.
Let me do one more.
This is great, great radio.
Let's try this one because that's a website I know.
So this ought to be something I can trust.
I like Machinima.
Come on, play the trailer.
Here we go.
Crude humor.
That's like this show.
With its trains.
I love the cat.
So Mega Man looks terrible.
The fuck is that?
Oh, he's in the Tetsujin outfit.
That is cool!
Okay, cool's okay.
Cool makes sense.
Yay, Kuro and Toro!
That's awful!
They've got to be just trolling us with that.
No, that's the real deal.
It has, um, what's his name's, Kenji Nafuni's blessing.
No, no, no, hold on.
It has his blessing from a year ago, prior to the whole Mega Man stuff being cancelled, prior to him leaving the company.
Yeah, he's like, hey, you wanted to use that in the game?
Okay, yeah, sure, that's fine.
I'm going to work on making Mega Man Legends 3.
Oh, by the way, we're letting you go.
That is the whole... Yeah, blessing from a year ago is what he has.
But, I mean, now it's just like fans are pissed off that you won't make a Mega Man game, that you won't put Mega Man in Mega Man...
Ultimate, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and then you pull this fucking shit.
You might as well just dress up Frank West as Mega Man because that would be less offensive than this bullshit.
It's funny watching what's happening because a lot of people... It's really interesting because a lot of gamers are looking at this going, not funny.
This is not funny.
I feel like gamers are actually offended by that.
DarkSakura, you just saw it for the first time.
Are you having that reaction too?
It's not funny?
I feel like I've got to throw up.
I mean, I'm not, I have a headache now.
I started to have a headache earlier and it was going away as I started to feel better.
But now I feel nauseous and my headache has come back.
Think about Pac-Man as Mokujin because that is kind of awesome actually.
That's Tetsujin.
Oh.
It was the metal outfit.
Oh, okay.
Tetsujin means iron.
Moku would Mokuyobi is Wednesday
No one curry.
I mean, I was just going to say that doesn't Capcom understand that these fucking characters are not part of Street Fighter or Tekken?
I mean, I understand that they want to do like a SNK versus, you know, versus Capcom game or something like that.
but there was a Namco cross Capcom game but it wasn't a fighting game why didn't they just do you know instead of Street Fighter cross Tekken why didn't they just do Namco cross Capcom the fighting game because that's what this is like they have the fucking final fight characters they have Cole which I mean that cool you got your exclusive characters for the PlayStation Cole isn't either one but okay whatever you know and and like Pac-Man so it just doesn't make any sense and none for Xbox buy
The only cool thing about this is Pac-Man.
Pac-Man's adorable.
But see, right before you watch that trailer, you're like, what the fuck?
Pac-Man?
Like, that's not gonna make sense.
But you watch it, you're like, oh, okay, that's right.
Mega Man!
What'd they do to Mega Man?
That's like the exact same reaction the rest of the internet had.
He's like, not even, you know, kinda lean and mean looking, but he's...
Looks like he's been eating too many donuts.
He looks like Mega Man going through a midlife crisis.
It looks like I put on a Mega Man outfit.
No.
Rob, you would look better than that dude.
Well, thank you.
Next story.
Yes.
How about some Doctor Who news?
There will be two Doctor Who games that are going to be on the PC, PlayStation 3, and... Actually, there's... There were two.
There is a Doctor Who The Eternity Clock is going to come out on March 2012.
And it is going to be... Well, it has The Silence.
and apparently a bunch of the other bad guys too like the Daleks because you can't have a Doctor Who game without the Daleks being all over it.
Exterminate.
Next news.
We're not having a BlizzCon next year.
No BlizzCon.
As in this year?
This year, yeah.
That means that I won't be able to do DisCon like I did last year.
Yep, no BlizzCon because apparently they are so busy with Diablo 3 and the pandas
and the Titan MMO.
They're just not going to do it.
Or they just have nothing to show us.
I mean, let's be real.
They have nothing to show us.
We already know everything.
Titan's not ready to show.
And whatever the next next expansion is for WoW, they're not going to show this early.
Little pandas.
But they didn't have a BlizzCon in 2006.
So folks do need to realize it was never supposed to be an annual event.
It just kind of worked out that way.
LOL Pandas.
You realize I have saved the name Fatty Cakes to make my panda.
I know.
What did I call my mud slapper?
After it was, you don't, we were playing around to You Don't Know Jack, and I think it was, is it one of Baskin-Robbins 31 flavors, or is it a term for a fart?
And Mud Slapper came up, and I'm like, I'm going to name my pandar in that.
Yes, that's a fart.
I almost did, named her after my, would name my panda after my current druid, and made her Ponderina.
Nice.
All right.
That's it for Rapid Fire News.
I think we've been promising this for some time now.
I think it's time to get into tonight's list list.
Yay!
Tonight's listless topic is What bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U, Xbox Lube, or PlayStation 4?
This was inspired by a tweet that was sent to me earlier this week from SSJ100Matt that said The next listless or match game should feature gaming bullshit rumors Because I was tweeting about the whole ridiculousness of some of the Xbox rumors that were going around And he suggested that and I said, you know what, consider it done
So here it is.
What bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U, Xbox Loop, or PlayStation 4?
If you have suggestions, you should yell them out in our chatroom at chat.orangemonstrady.com because when a host needs an answer, they might consult our chatroom and pick some of our favorites.
The way this works, I'll recap for you one time.
Four people are going to participate, so it's going to be us and Alan is in the room.
Hi Alan, how you doing?
Good, yay, hi.
What's new?
Skyrim.
Okay, alright.
So we're all going to go around and name our top three, and then we each go around the room and take one off of the list.
That leaves a list of eight.
You guys in our chat room then vote on the list of eight to pick your number one and number two favorites, and then we have our definitive list of the top three bullshit rumors that will be next about the Wii U, Xbox Loom, or PlayStation 4.
My hand was in the air like I was in school
A headset will come out that will send a signal directly to the brain through a small laser shot toward the optical nerve that will provide an immersive environment and a euphoric effect, making them easily conquerable by our alien overlords.
So, I'm going to shorten that to say Borg headset.
The little thing from the Star Trek episode, The Game.
Ah.
And what console will that be on?
It's Nintendo.
It'll be on the Wii U. That's a Sony thing.
Controlling you, that would be Sony.
It's always one step closer to the holodeck, right?
Yes, one step closer to the holodeck.
How about Loki?
Why don't you go next?
Loki, what's your number three answer?
My number three answer will be that the Xbox loop to further its immersion with gamers and stuff will fire different colored liquids at you depending on the situation.
Blood spray, sweat, paint.
so it will actually it's gonna be liquid vision and it'll actually fire shit at you and get your living room and when you're playing a sex game it's iridescent and foamy and shows up really well under a black light all right I'll go next my number three answer for next bullshit rumor is
The Xbox Lube will introduce a new technology that is 100% hackproof!
Yay!
See what I did there?
I see what you did there.
Alright, so the Xbox Lube will be 100% hackproof.
Outro Music
It's made out of a mystery material from space.
All right.
So, Alan, what is your number three answer?
Microsoft purchases the Mega Video brand.
Next, Xbox caps streaming Netflix at 72 minutes.
Adds DLC queue for XBLA silver numbers.
How am I supposed to shorten that?
Wait, they're going to cap Netflix to 72 minutes?
In some ways, that's funny.
That's trolling the pirates because it's like, LOL, you got a free movie and then trolled.
You don't get to see the ending.
That's kind of funny.
And what was the other half of that?
Also, for Mega Download, you have to enter a queue to actually download the episode you want, and sometimes it would be up to an hour or more.
So if you're an Xbox Silver member, you'd have to wait to buy to get your DLC.
All right, there you go.
Xbox taking some tips from Mega Video.
All right, let's go to Loki for his number two answer.
I'm sorry, DarkSakura was first.
I was going to say, please.
I was doing things out of order.
DarkSakura, your number two answer, please.
The Wii U will actually have a camera and a controller that maps your face to your Mii, but it secretly steals your soul and feeds it to Miyamoto.
So they advertise it as having a webcam in it, but it steals your soul.
Now, what will Miyamoto be doing with those souls?
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
Okay.
Using it to fuel his dark magical powers.
To make a new Zelda game.
All right.
Loki, your number two answer.
It'll be Zelda Soul Force.
Well, I was going to have it be like the Wii U as a VR headset, but that's kind of been done before.
So the Wii U is the controller.
Like the actual console is the controller.
So you better make sure you don't throw it because that might be bad.
It's a giant glove.
Wait, I put Wii U. The console is the controller.
Don't throw it.
Change it.
Here we go.
It's got to be funnier.
Alright, fine.
It is the controller, but it's shaped like a giant number one foam glove.
Because they're the number one consoles.
I like the idea of a big number one foam glove being the next
They're trying to reel in the sports lover demographic.
My number two answer is that the PlayStation 4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid so you can participate in Tron, like IRL.
End of line.
This show reboot, right?
Is that what you're talking about?
Yeah.
I don't remember that show.
What was that?
Incoming Game.
It was a Saturday morning cartoon on ABC.
It was one of the first fully featured... Remember they had blue faces?
They were purple.
They were purple.
Hold on, I'm typing this out.
PS4 will actually let you beam yourself in the grid.
Okay.
I have a friend that's a really big fan of that show, too.
How many years has that been off the show?
All right.
Alan, your number two answer for next bullshit rumor.
Taking a hint from the PS2 Emotion Engine, the PS4 will have an empathy engine chip that actually really does feel the same pain as you when its $799 price point is revealed.
Womp womp.
Alright.
So the PS4 Empathy Engine actually will feel sorry for Sony when the price point is revealed.
Alright, I like that.
PS4 Empathy Engine.
Alright, DarkSakura.
It's time for the number one answers.
Let me recap, just so we don't have any duplicates.
Let me recap.
Headset from the game for PS4.
I should put Star Trek the game.
Okay, headset from Star Trek The Game for PlayStation 4.
Fire different colored liquids at you.
What console was that?
Lube.
Oh, the Lube.
Come on.
It's lubricating.
Liquid.
It fires warming gel in your eye.
Xbox Lube is 100% hack proof.
Xbox teams up with Mega Video, which brings caps for Netflix.
The Wii U will steal your soul and feed to Miyamoto.
Wii U is the console, is the controller, and it comes with a big number one foam glove.
PS4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid.
And the PlayStation 4 has an empathy engine.
When you hear the $799 price point, it will cry.
Alright, DarkSakura.
I would think it would laugh.
Number one answer for next bullshit rumor.
For the lube.
Everyone will be issued a skin implant that has what games they've purchased registered to their DNA.
That would be the only real way And most importantly, hack-proof
So when you actually go in to give blood samples, they'll be able to see what games you've purchased.
Ooh, someone's been playing X-Tango.
Okay.
Really?
You bought Fusion Frenzy?
All right.
Loki, number one answer.
The PlayStation 4 will be co-produced by Capcom.
It will arrive in the shape of the Bad Box art Mega Man in the position where he is teabagging the consumer.
As a special thanks from Capcom Wait, the console or the box?
No, the actual console will be in the shape of Bad Box Art Mega Man Think of it as a statue, if you will Where he is teabagging the user PS4 co-produced by Capcom Console is shaped as Mega Man teabag It's the ultimate insult Or the ultimate troll I see, I see It's all been leading up to this Exactly It's a PlayStation exclusive, you see
My number one answer, President Cat is a launch title for the Wii U. That's a seller.
I might sell me the system.
Hey, it could happen.
All right.
Hey, an insider source told me they're thinking about it.
Alan, your number one answer.
My ideas kind of fell apart when I came to number three, so this one is really as good.
The second gen 3DS XL will also double as and work better than the Wii U's controller tablet from launch.
Comes with a free seppuku blade for early adopters.
So basically the next 3DS will work with the Wii U and actually be better than what comes with the Wii U. And you can fall on it when you realize how much you paid for it.
Yeah.
Got it.
All right.
All right, guys.
Here we go.
Let's see.
First, I got to read off some of the answers from chat here.
I don't know if I see.
TigerClaw says, how about the Wii U introduces a new career field that lets you control the dashboard or games but only using your mind?
Ahamkara says, Sony and Microsoft secretly joined forces to develop a console to beat Nintendo, since that's the only way that they could win the console battle in Japan and the worldwide.
Acidic Vampire thinks that in DarkSakura's answer about Miyamoto taking the souls, they'll be transferred to the Miis.
Let's see.
TigerClaw says, the Xbox introduces a peripheral.
Oh, wait.
I already saw that one.
Somebody said something about they only play MMOs.
There you go.
Some of the answers from our chat room.
All right.
But we want to change yours.
Yeah, get rid of my third one.
Or my final one.
I want to replace it.
The 3DS XL?
Yes.
It's all that I need.
So it's rumored that the load up splash screen for the Wii U is actually a memory erasing pulse so that they can get you to buy Legend of Zelda and Mario yet another time.
So I have the Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you re-buy games all over again.
I like that.
Do I own Super Mario 3?
I can't remember.
Don't I have Mario 3?
I love Mario 3!
Alright, now's the part where we go around and eliminate items from the list.
It's very difficult, but it has to be done.
Alright, here's the list as it stands so far.
Headset from Star Trek The Game for PS4.
Xbox Lube, fire different colored liquids at you.
Xbox Lube is 100% hack-proof.
Xbox teams up with Mega Video, caps for Netflix.
Wii U will steal your soul and feed them to Miyamoto.
Wii U is the console's controller and it's just a big number one foam glove.
The PlayStation 4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid.
PlayStation 4 has an empathy engine, priced at $799, so it will feel pained.
Xbox Lube, Skin Implant, which purchase is registered to your DNA.
The PlayStation 4 is co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as Mega Man teabagging you.
President Cat is a launch title for the Wii U and the Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you rebuy the games again.
Unfortunately, the list cannot stay in this shape.
We have to tinker with it a little bit and erase those that are unworthy.
DarkSakura, which of these is unworthy of the list?
I have to go with the liquid one.
That's just ew.
That's one of my favorites.
The Xbox Lube firing different colored liquids at you.
I would vote for that one, but it is off the list.
Sorry, chatters.
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
I take off it's 100% hack-proof because they will make that claim and unfortunately it's not going to be 100% hack-proof.
Alright, it is stricken from the list.
Um...
I'm thinking, sorry, I don't mean to be quiet.
I'm going to erase... I'm going to erase... I'm sorry, Jamie, the headset from Star Trek The Game for the PlayStation 4.
It went over my head.
Alright, it is off the list.
Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Oh boy, um...
President Cat's launch title for the Wii U. I think you just eliminated the one the entire chat would have voted for.
But it is off the list.
What?
That's probably the second or third time I've done that on this list.
We've gotten rid of the popular fandom one.
So I'm just keeping up with my shitty reputation.
All right, Alan keeps his shitty reputation by striking President Cat as a launch title for the Wii U. It is off the list.
So here it is.
Here is the list.
As you can vote for, please send your number one and your number two answers as a private message to Sky in the chat room.
S-K-I-E, Sky in the chat room.
Here is the list as it stands now.
Xbox teams up with Mega Video, and there's caps for Netflix.
The Wii U will steal your soul and feed it to Miyamoto.
The Wii U where the console is the controller and it's a big number one foam glove The PS4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid from Tron PlayStation 4 empathy engine that will feel the pain of a $799 price point Xbox Lube has a skin implant with purchases registered to your DNA PlayStation 4 is co-produced by Capcom and the old school Mega Man will teabag you
Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you rebuy games there is the list as it stands now place your number one and your number two votes in a private message to Sky S-K-I-E in the chat with your vote we will tally them up and have the answers for you shortly in the meantime let's go to more news from Loki thank you Alan are you going to stick around for results later?
yeah just to tell chat the reason why I deleted the President Cat one is because it was more about a game than the console
Justify, justify, justify.
Alright, no, it's fine.
Alright, moving on.
There's a rumor that SNK may be releasing a new Neo Geo handheld system.
Not necessarily a Neo Geo Pocket, but it's currently known as the Neo Geo Portable Device.
Um... And it's a handheld.
They're saying it's slightly bigger than an iPhone.
It comes with 2 gigs of storage, plenty of buttons, a 4.3 inch screen, SD card slot, headphone jack, and AV out.
Sounds just like a Dingu, to be honest.
Looks just like a Dingu.
Um... And, uh... They're saying, um...
Thanks to official SNK licensing, it comes preloaded with 20 Neo Geo titles, North American versions, including Metal Slug, Fatal Fury Specials, Sengoku, King of the Monsters, and Magician Lord, as well as many others.
I have Magician Lord already.
And, let's see...
Yeah, it sounds neat.
Of course, this is coming from Famicom Plaza, and SNK hasn't really confirmed anything yet, but it looks neat.
Totally want...
interesting as long as the games are cheaper that's the most important thing oh yeah all right moving on with some other uh little Nintendo updates going on uh Nintendo has apparently um I guess they're they're really experiencing some heavy losses and it's even funny because the story's so much out there that that one what is that Asian company that does all the animations that end up on like Conan O'Brien and stuff of the news NME is that their name
I can't remember.
It's like anime or something.
They actually did a video on this whole Nintendo's losing money thing.
But the interesting kind of silver lining to this is that apparently 15 million 3DS units have been sold since the launch.
So 3DS has really recovered in many ways, which I seem to remember saying on this show would happen around Christmas.
But anyway...
Here's the thing though, Nintendo did basically switch their forecast around from a $20 billion profit to an actual loss.
Nintendo had sales of $7.2 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal year, and that was a 31% decrease, and their overall loss was 48.4 billion yen, that's $620 million dollars.
Quote, Nintendo 3DS hardware during the nine months ended December 31st, 2011 were 11.43 million units and the total worldwide sales since its launch exceeded 15 million units.
That's in the official press release from the company.
Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 are million selling titles.
I want to say I've heard they're up to like 5 million actually at this point.
so apparently some of these financial woes are making people think maybe they should get into more mobile gaming there's that whole talk again maybe Nintendo should put something out on iOS but I highly doubt that will ever happen their stock by the way is currently at a five year low so they have a lot riding on them for this E3 in my opinion they're gonna have to impress if they don't impress at this year's E3 it's gonna be very bad very bad
Alright, moving on, DarkSakura is going to open up the email bag and read some emails for us.
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com DarkSakura dives into the email bag and reads some of those emails here on air.
Blade 3 Studio Grade
Ooh!
I don't have any spare XLR cables, unfortunately, but I believe you are likely already using them.
So if you guys could contact me back, whatever, we can work it out.
Thanks, guys.
Keep up the fantastic work.
P.S.
My grammar sucks.
Lol.
Raffle party.
Limifo.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, we first had an email from Rabababa that said, I looked around for sites blacking out today, January 18th.
I'm very disappointed.
Sites that could bring a lot more force to the event are not participating.
Google censored their own logo, but I think being blacked out would be more effective.
The only one of my favorite sites that is down is GamePolitics.
Your site was also down when I checked, but something tells me that wasn't on purpose.
I guess it was.
Yeah, we took it down on purpose.
There should have been a message there.
Now there's a PS.
Okay.
Sorry.
Almost immediately after writing the email below, senators and reps are dropping their support from SOPA and PIPA.
Even the sponsors of the bills, the MPAA, then responded in the most ironic way, accusing sites like Reddit and Wikipedia of trying to make Congress into their corporate puppets to further their financial empire.
That is ironic and stupid.
Also, the Google protest seems to have caught some attention for linking their censorship logo directly to a petition with a very cool infographic.
My own opinion is that piracy is already wrong and we have the legal system in place to address that via due process.
Well, look what happened to that mega video.
Although, you know, it did take a while, but that guy's, you know, and a lot of his people are in jail now and not getting out anytime soon.
By the way, did you know that that same guy was, like, the number one Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 player, like, in the world?
He cheated.
Did he?
Yeah.
How'd he do it?
Uh, there's ways.
You don't want to share?
Okay.
No, I just, I don't play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
I'm assuming it's very much like, uh...
it is ironic though that he's getting more time in jail than some rapists and killers but you know welcome to America apparently he used to play like Quake and stuff like that and Rage Quit and stuff and I don't know whatever I don't know I can't can't really speak for you know playing him so I don't know
We have one last email.
Oh, and by the way, people who sent me the Master System things, I've got two of you already, and I'm going to be sending those out.
Just to let you know, I haven't forgotten.
I just have to get paid.
Hey, OLR crew, happy new year and congratulations on the move to the new studio.
The show sounds great, and it's good to hear Alan is a regular contributor now, although I have to express my endless... What?
Oops, sorry, the Twitter music started playing.
My endless sorrow at the retirement of Shermie.
Shermie is not sorrowful.
She has her own room that smells like her butt.
Except I cleaned, it's also the laundry room.
I cleaned it, but you know what?
She's happy.
That room gets warm every time we dry the clothes.
Sometimes a warm towel gets dropped on her as a blanket.
And she's a very happy girl.
DarkSakura.com
So, but here's the thing.
If you're my 3DS friend, I send out pictures of the cats in 3D all the time on Swap Note.
So, just ask Tiger Claw or Jason if he's listening tonight or Shane, I think, is in chat.
A few of you are on my Facebook and I put pictures up on Facebook.
Yeah.
Especially Mariko walking around with that tail in the air.
Look at me.
My tail's in the air.
Look at my butt.
I love Mariko.
Such a sweetie.
Sanrio is very, very, she's a cute little old lady too.
She's sweet, but she gives me the stink eye sometimes.
Yeah, because you're another girl.
I know.
So I have two disparate topics I was hoping that Rob, Jamie, and Loki could weigh in on.
No.
The first being the announcement of Resident Evil 6.
Are any of you excited by this news?
Not really.
I don't play the Resident Evil series, so no.
I got out of the series some time ago, although I did dabble in Resident Evil 4, which was pretty darn good, and I really should have committed more time to the game.
And then Resident Evil 5 was like, what?
From what I hear, Resident Evil 6 is a little more like 4 than it was like 5, which is probably a very good thing.
What I want to know is, why does the logo look like a chick blowing a giraffe?
Have you looked at the logo?
Wait, let me put it here in chat here.
Well, while you do that, I'm going to finish reading the part of the email.
Are you excited by the news?
I am personally having a bit of a fangasm seeing them bring back Leon, Ashley, and Hunnigan as I am a huge Resident Evil 4 fan but have been playing all the games since day one.
It does kind of look like giraffe.
See?
It's just blowing!
It's a chick blowing a giraffe.
Cannot unsee.
Yes, now you won't be able to unsee it.
There it is.
Oh, Jeffrey, what have you gotten yourself into?
That's what happened to the Toys R Us mascot.
I haven't seen him in forever.
I'm glad he found work on Resident Evil porn.
Speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.
And by the way, the last one that I actually played was, that I really actually last played was Gun Survivor.
The one that was like Code Veronica, Gun Survivor 2.
Oh, okay.
In the arcade.
That was the last one I actually played myself.
So speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.
Have any of you downloaded the Revelations demo for 3DS?
No, because I don't have one.
I was particularly impressed by the graphical potential the 3DS is beginning to show.
With the Vita coming out next month and games for dedicated portable systems trending toward console-level graphics, do any of you feel that at some point the two will intersect?
Maybe.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
Wait, read that last sentence again.
With the Vita coming out next month and games for dedicated portable systems trending toward console level graphics, do any of you feel that at some point the two will intersect?
Well, haven't handhelds always kind of felt like they're just a generation behind?
I mean, look at the DS.
The DS is a lot like a Nintendo 64.
Like, the first DS was a bunch of ports and Nintendo 64 stuff.
The Game Boy Advance was a bunch of ports and Super Nintendo stuff.
The original Game Boy, especially the color, had a lot of NES stuff on it.
So they're always kind of, you know, just a generation behind.
So I think...
I don't know about the Vita so much.
I wouldn't say that the Vita is going to have the potential to play like PlayStation 3 stuff, although... It's supposed to be PlayStation 3 quality graphics.
Yeah, because it's smaller resolution.
So yeah, that's kind of what I'm talking out here is that because of the smaller resolution, you know, your TV, when you say 1080p, that's 1080 pixels, right?
But the amount that's on the Vita is less.
So you can still render high definition images, but just a lower resolution because it's a smaller picture.
So I think it's going to look really good.
But I especially don't know about direct ports.
I'm more excited about this whole thing we were talking about earlier with the whole Vita possibly connecting to your PS3, be it hacks or whatever.
All I'm waiting for is Grand Theft Auto V on the Vita.
Sold.
there's a little bit more I wonder if at some point one market might cannibalize the other while I'm personally thrilled by the prospect of having PS3 slash 360 quality games on the go it seems only logical to assume that at some point these systems will function as portable consoles right oh so that was really the point he was getting out of that okay I get it now
Why not just wirelessly stream the content from the portable system to the TV in your living room if you want a console-style experience and slip it into your pocket when you don't?
I understand that the Wii U is trying to walk the fine line between these two entities, but it honestly seems like a letdown if the remote only works when you are in Wi-Fi range.
Your thoughts?
Okay, I get it.
So, okay, the rest of the email really kind of fills that in.
So the iPad 2?
What about it?
It does just that.
You can stream content from the iPad to your Apple TV to your TV.
I get what he's saying though is that if the power of what is taking up all the space in my living room is in my pocket, then why do I need a console?
But keep in mind, that's why console developers are kind of... I think console developers kind of see this too.
And I think that's why you're starting to see things that won't fit in your pocket.
Like Kinect.
All these streaming devices that will go to your home theater sound system and so forth.
And these systems becoming more of like entertainment hubs.
But I don't know.
For me...
I don't like playing handheld games all the time sometimes I want that gigantic you know 34 inch or however big our TV is picture you know like I would want to play a game like Final Fantasy 13 too on my little DS in bed you know I want to you know maybe sometimes it would be cool like once in a while for the mundane stuff but the big cut scenes and things like that I want to see on the high def TV you know I don't know I
I don't know if one's necessarily going to cannibalize the other but it's a very interesting point that you're making and it's kind of neat that now the consoles are kind of doing things that the TVs are having a hard time like 3D, the TVs haven't all been able to adopt that across the board yet now here we have the 3DS so it's interesting a lot of ports, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of ports like the same stuff coming out on the PS3 you're going to see on the Vita and the 3DS it'll be interesting
Yes.
To conclude, your loyal OLR fanboy, TonicVision, who I would love to commend on fantastic grammar and spelling.
Gold star emailer of the week.
Yep, you win the no prize.
Kaijudo in our chatroom says, my thoughts is this person plays way too many video games.
Why would you want to walk around with a PlayStation 3?
Well, I seem to remember... Hey, I have a Nomad.
Well, that, and didn't they used to have that little, like, tiny screen that you could plug into the back of a PlayStation 1?
Yes.
Like, it was an actual thing.
Play it in the car.
Yeah, so you could, like, play it in the car.
And didn't somebody in this room make one for an Xbox?
Yeah, that Xbox blew up, by the way.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Hooked up, pop!
And... blew something, so... Eh, whatever.
It was old.
For the record, I have a Nomad, and I have a Turbo Express, which with a TV tuner, you could hook up your Turbo Express to the, uh... to the TV, and then you could just take the Turbo Express with you.
And with your cue cards.
I really like this comment from Bochikawa in chat.
And I think this really gives you something to think about on the topics.
Let me read it again from Bochikawa at chat.
Handheld games are different to me.
If I were to pull out Street Fighter on break at work, I wouldn't stop.
But playing Pokemon at work is quick and easy.
That's a very interesting point is think about the types of games that are being made on these systems.
What is easier to play on the go?
And I think I was mentioning this before.
It might have been on Bobby's show.
We were doing the call at the end of the Bobby Blackwolf show as we do every week.
But I was talking about how Tiny Tower makes a great iOS game because you can play it for 30 seconds or whatever and then you're done.
Like, it would be a terrible game to play on PlayStation 3 or something like that.
Like, it just kind of works on iOS.
And a lot of the stuff that they kind of try to force on iOS, like ports of games like Mega Man 2 or the Capcom Arcade where you can play Street Fighter 2 on the iPhone, it sucks.
You can't control it.
The touchscreen thing doesn't work.
It's terrible.
So sometimes it is designing about really the right game to go with the system.
Very interesting.
Is that it for emails tonight?
That would be it.
No more emails.
Sad face.
I think it's about time for the FUs of the week.
This is the part of the show where we get angsty.
F you to the day I've had and not having a tablet.
Loki?
Fuck you for the FBI going after Mega Upload because I actually did have files that I use on there.
And I also had a paid subscription.
Thankfully it wasn't that long of a paid subscription.
But it's annoying because I lost a lot of my files that weren't piracy related at all.
So yeah, that sucks.
and besides, yeah, taking down Mega Upload.
Really, that stopped all the piracy.
It's all gone.
There's not, like, file sharing sites everywhere else.
Oh, yeah.
You did a good job.
A lot of those file share sites block the U.S., which I thought was interesting.
Yeah, that's... You can get around that shit.
Oh, I'm sure you can.
Same way you do it in China.
All right.
Um, my FU of the week, I don't know, I don't really want too many details about it, but FU to uncertainty.
We'll leave it at that.
Alright, uh, let's go and do the listless results from Angry to Happy.
Oops.
Listless results, here it is as you guys voted the top three.
This is it, this is the definitive list.
These are the rumors that are coming next.
Or they're not true.
The PlayStation 4 is co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as a Mega Man teabagging you.
Excellent.
The number two answer.
The Wii U will steal your soul and feed it to Miyamoto.
Yay.
And lastly, the number one answer, the thing, this is it, this is the next rumor, and it's a thing.
The Wii U, where the console is the controller because it's a big number one foamy glove.
There it is.
How appropriate that number one is number one.
Ah, Alan, the chatter's rejected both your and I answers all the way.
Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim
Yes, and I cheat for gold, and I'm not sorry.
Did you take an arrow to the knee?
Yes.
Get out.
All right.
All right, there it is, your list list for tonight.
Just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the Twitter topics, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But not just yet, we have some more stories for you guys.
Loki?
Let's talk a little bit about Resident Evil 6 again, other than the fact that the logo sort of looks like giraffe-flatio.
Giraffe-flatio.
It rolls off the tongue.
Is that censored on Xbox, giraffe-flatio?
Anyways, so apparently it's the largest scale game ever made for Capcom.
It has 600 people involved and should be pretty expensive by the sounds of that.
Apparently, to put the numbers into perspective, Assassin's Creed 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 were completed by 450 people.
Well, 450 for Assassin's Creed 2, 1,000 for Grand Theft Auto 4.
So it would be pretty significant.
Of course, it could also be very buggy.
Who knows?
You ever heard the phrase, too many cooks in the kitchen?
I want to know how on earth that Resident Evil box art got out.
It's like nobody looked at the work that the designer did.
The designer screwed it all up.
I was trying to get a reaction.
I'm not getting anything.
She's just not paying attention to me.
I'm sorry, what?
I said for Resident Evil Resolations.
I'm surprised that that got out.
No, well, I'm talking about the box art for Resident Evil.
You said Resident Evil and my brain just went... Zzzz.
Resident Evil Revelations that box art went out with a misspelling and I was surprised how that happened and it got out and I said the designer didn't check their work it's all the designer's fault and the designer is to blame no I'll tell you what happened okay well yeah first of all the designer made a typo the designer should have caught that but also QA should have caught that marketing should have caught that distribution should have caught that the end
Anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to derail from Resident Evil 6, but I'm sure it'll be great, even if the logo looks like Giraffe Lay Show.
Hey, Steam has a new iOS client.
It's in beta right now.
But I found that it's actually pretty easy.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just lucky.
But I tried to log into the Steam iOS app and it said, sorry, you're not in the beta.
And I'm like, well, boo, you whore.
And I shut it off.
But then the next day I was like, well, I wonder if I'm in the beta yet.
I don't have an email, but I'm just going to try it anyway.
And sure enough, it let me right in.
So I'm able to get into the Steam app.
Beta App.
And here's what it basically lets you do.
Sorry, you're not going to be able to suddenly play Arkham City on your iPhone.
It doesn't do that.
You don't actually get to play the games.
But it's a front end for the store.
You can see the stores.
You can see the sales.
Of course, they want you to be able to spend your money right there from the wallet there.
Buy some games.
But here's something else that's interesting.
You can use the chat from Steam.
from your phone and I actually was doing that a little bit like I was on my phone in the other room and I started sending messages to Alan while he was playing Skyrim I was like lol ghost I'm not there to be doing this and so he figured out that I must have got into the iOS app but the chat functionality is pretty cool at least so and you can see what your friends are playing and I guess you can still look at things like screenshots and videos all on the go so the good news about that is is that like if you have this awesome Skyrim bug that you got a video of
You could get out your iPhone and say, hey, look at what happened to me in Skyrim, dude, and play it, and then it's right there.
So that's kind of cool.
I bet it's a matter of time before maybe we start seeing some game stuff.
I don't know if it'll be like the same games you see on –
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, maybe I should check and see if they let me in yet.
You never know.
Alright.
Moving on.
DarkSakura.
Me.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Me.
How about PixelJunk Eden?
Guess where it's going to be?
Steam!
As in Thursday.
This week, February 2nd, we will have PixelJunk Eden coming to PC on Steam.
So you can get it for $9.99.
It's the full game and the Encore DLC.
And you can get the soundtrack separately for $6.
Okay.
$6?
That's a bargain at half the price.
It is a bargain at half the price.
I'll wait for the 4th of July sale when it's going to be $0.75.
I know, right?
No, PixelJunk are pretty good games.
I found one of the PixelJunk games for PSP at RCWilly for $5.
What is R.C.
Willey?
Is that like a Big Lots type of store?
No, it's a huge, expensive furniture store.
And they have electronics.
Except they're owned by Mormons, so they're closed on Sunday.
That's weird.
Well, not the Mormon part, but the part about the whole, like, PSP games.
Kind of weird.
All right.
A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.
Loki.
All right.
And, see, the last thing we're going to talk about here... Well, the last thing I want to talk about is...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
which they came out afterwards because everyone's going, you know, what the fuck, you know, why?
I have to actually, you know, buy this game new to have, you know, the actual quest line for the game?
You know, that doesn't make any sense.
They're saying that, you know, we always wanted to put this game or this content out as free bonus content, um...
Thanks for watching!
What they really should have done is just put bonus DLC with your first run games.
It honestly would just be a different way of phrasing the same thing.
Yes, and people would not get pissed off.
They'd be like, you get this bonus.
No one's going to complain, oh, hey, guess what?
We're going to give the people that buy the new game our first content pack of DLC for free.
Everyone to be like, fuck yeah, that's awesome.
Thank you for rewarding people for buying it new.
But then you're saying instead that, oh, it's just, you know, it's an online pass.
You're making people feel like you're giving them something as opposed to taking something away.
Exactly.
That's what it is.
That's what it all boils down to.
Is that the same guy that's like the guy behind it who was like a big baseball player back in the day?
Well, Kurt Schilling is actually the head of the company, 38 Studios.
And isn't he the same guy that's posting online?
No, this is their community manager.
But yeah, he posted online some follow-up too.
But no, he said, you know, we wanted to post a quick clarification for something that we've seen a few comments on.
For what it's worth, the House of Valor content was not in the finished game disc at one point and then removed.
Okay, so it sounded like before that it was part of the finished game disc, but it's not.
Yeah.
They're saying that it isn't.
It's nothing that we're locking you out of.
It was supposed to be standalone download content.
Okay, well that's great.
So it was a situation where it was going to be free download content later on.
But don't fucking call an online pass because it still implies that you're taking something away.
I mean, I understand that EA calls their passes online passes, but just call it, like, a voucher for free DLC, because people won't get as pissed off about that.
I've heard the demo is pretty dreadful, like, just because it's so buggy, and they've actually apologized for the demo and all this, and it's kind of like, dude, why would you... I mean, I'm so shocked that companies allow this to happen.
Like, how did that happen?
If people up at the top are so...
I can't believe that we put out a product like that.
Oh my god, why would I give you $60 of my money to trust that I'm going to get a good time?
Let me put it this way.
This is what I've said about download passes and stuff like that.
Even though you're not getting this extra quest line, who gives a fuck?
Seriously, we're talking a bonus quest DLC thing that you may or...
I've heard some positive things about it though.
Some people say it is the game that everybody thought Fable would be.
Yeah, I mean, it looks cool, and I hate to see, like, games that kind of try something a little bit different, you know?
Sorry, was it supposed to be, like, multiplayer or MMO at some point?
I don't think so.
I thought it was.
There was supposed to be some type of multi-person element in it that went away.
But, I mean, I don't know.
Don't let the fact that this online pass is in there... Because I'd say for a game like Battlefield or something like that where you can't access the online portion, demoing it out used without paying for the online pass, that is kind of crippling because you can miss a whole portion of the game that...
DarkSakura,
I don't know.
It's whatever.
It is what it is.
Buy it or don't.
All right.
Lastly for you guys tonight, I don't know.
As a resident here in the state of California, this just pisses me off.
But California has agreed that they're going to reimburse the Entertainment Software Association just shy of $1 million.
That's $950,000 in legal fees for fighting Brown versus the EMA up to the Supreme Court.
Let's see.
The state negotiated that down from the $1.1 million.
Wow.
Now, there was already reimbursements previously for the case in 2008.
This means that California has paid out in total $1.3 million to the ESA.
Yeah, they're raising our tuition.
and I quote, Senator Yee and Governor Schwarzenegger wasted more than $1 million in taxpayer funds at a time when Californians could ill afford it, says Mike Gallagher, who is the president of the ESA.
However, we feel strongly that some of these funds should be used to improve services for California's youth.
So the ESA is just kind of like rubbing it in basically.
Now, the ESA did say they will donate a portion of the proceeds from the reimbursement to, quote, develop after-school educational programs for underserved communities in Oakland and Sacramento.
Hey, our backyard.
This new education initiative will start in the spring and, quote, harness young people's natural passion for playing and making video games and connecting them to the development of critical 21st century job skills.
Well, while that's all nice and good that the ESA is pouring some of that money back into the community, I'm a realist, and I know certainly not all of it is going back into the community, and that's my fucking tax dollars that just went to the ESA, which, if I remember right, is now an organization that was supporting SOPA and PIPA and all this stuff.
And it's like, I don't want my money going to lobby for this stuff.
Okay, fair enough.
They did withdraw, but...
I still feel like in some indirect way I paid to help lobby for Soba and Pippa for a short time and that kind of irritates me.
I'm really irritated and Senator Yi will not kind of give up this fight and I feel like he needs to be removed from office by vote.
Now sadly I don't live in a place that gets to vote for him or against him but I mean, sorry, he needs to go.
He wasted that money and so did the governor but the governor's already gone, thank God.
That was just a joke.
Look, I realize we're not a political show and people get very, very passionate and personal about political stuff, but I just... Governor Schwarzenegger was absolutely terrible for the state.
I'm sorry.
He was so bad.
So, so bad.
And if you need proof, here's one of many examples of how taxpayer dollars were just fucking wasted.
And now it's like the state is fucking broke.
Businesses are leaving this state.
They want to talk about upping taxes.
They're upping education.
I mean, like,
You know what's going to ultimately end Orange Lounge Radio?
I'm going to tell you.
You know what's going to ultimately end this show?
One of us is going to leave California because we can't afford to be here anymore.
It was almost that.
It was literally almost that.
Yep.
Dan wanted us to up and move to Washington and I begged I was seriously in a really bad way over that potential I can't do it I won't do it you barely dodged a bullet and you never know if heaven forbid myself, Loki lost our job and we could only find something somewhere else that'll be what ends the show
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
It's just absolutely ridiculous.
You know what I'm paying right now in junior college is just under what I was paying for my four-year school in 95.
I'm paying $36 a unit hour.
And I was paying about $42 at the University of South Alabama.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah.
so I know a lot of folks go oh California's all sunshiny and all this stuff but it's it can sometimes be a little bit sad there you go sorry I didn't mean to be Debbie Downer but that's where we live and that's an important story to talk about please do not let Senator Yee get re-elected he fucked up he would not let this go he would not let it go and I think he has to pay the price for it that's my thought
Let's take calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
That's all one word.
The Skype line is open and we are taking calls right now.
Although, I don't know.
After that downer of a topic, we might have scared everybody off.
So let's see if there's any tweets.
That's my wacky morning DJ noise.
Here's a... Let's talk... Let's do a story about pot.
That'll make everybody feel better, at least a lot more relaxed.
It'll make me throw up.
Tigerclaw has sent us a link to a story on Kotaku that says, Hey, you might want to get rid of those pictures of you smoking weed before you unload your Nintendo 3DS.
And you can imagine where this story goes.
um somebody bought an xbox off a craigslist or gamestop or whatever what what is this um oh it was from the uk where this happened where somebody inherited a used 3ds and on the 3ds was a picture of a dude smoking a bong which i believe is as illegal in the uk as it is here meaning technically it's illegal but you know most people won't do anything about it um but still i mean fucking if you're
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's the one and only Ranma.
Hey, I haven't heard from you in a while.
What's up?
Not too much.
I've been around here and there, you know.
Oh, I bet you get around.
What's up?
Something interesting that happened to me and Jill Videa yesterday.
Do tell.
We played Dance Central for the very first time.
It took you this long?
I don't have a Kinect, and my sister who had a housewarming, she has a Kinect and a 360.
After she put her daughter down and the drinking kind of went a little crazy, she suggested instead of rock band, let's do Dance Central.
So it was all like, why the fuck not?
Why the fuck not?
So you played DDR and dance games for many years.
What did you think of Dance Central?
The main reason why I never played Dance Central is because I thought I would make a fool of myself.
Still did.
It was just as funny.
But I noticed that, to me, one song in Dance Central is equal to maybe my normal two or three song dance set in DDR.
Because when I was done, I felt like I was going to collapse completely.
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.
Have you played, did you get to play the sequel, Dance Central 2 at all?
Yes, yes, because it was sitting there, my sister didn't finish that one, so we was all like, you know, we might as well help her, and popped it in, first song I did was Sandstorm Oh lordy I was like, oh, many a con, many a con Did you get to see the dance for Born This Way?
I believe somebody did do Born This Way.
It was pretty feminine, wasn't it?
Yes, but with enough alcohol, it's all good across the board.
Everything's all good with alcohol, that's for sure.
So did playing Dance Central make you go, maybe I want to get a Kinect after all?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Now, you mentioned it as part of the UK releases, the Rhythm Party.
Oh, I just totally missed it because I was focusing on something else.
Yeah, Rhythm Party is a game by Konami.
It's all the people that did Dance Masters on Xbox Live Arcade.
And it's some, like I saw the song list.
Naoki had the song list up, but it's seriously like a bunch of Konami originals and then Born This Way by Lady Gaga.
Like, they finally licensed, like, a big song.
And one other one, too, that caught my eye is, like, Celebration, I think.
Let me go look at Naoki's Facebook.
Because, yeah, it's like a $10 game.
I'm sure they're going to put DLC out on it or something, but it's coming out very soon.
Like, uh...
Was it this week?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, she read it for UK releases, so I think it's out here, too.
I'm trying to find it.
Where is it?
Here it is.
Rhythm Party, Born This Way, Every Little Step by Bobby Brown, YMCA by the Village People, the Desro featuring Vanilla Ice songs.
Yes, that happened, apparently, at some point.
What?
I would like to hear those.
Desro and Vanilla Ice?
For real, yeah.
Hold on.
Let me see if I can pull this up here.
Desro was one of the Konami in-house bands.
I think so.
Aren't they an in-house band?
They did Cobalt in Poppin' Music and Dancer in 2DX.
And don't forget, there's also Daikinkai in DDR, I believe.
Yeah, Daikinkai.
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.
This is a clip from Dance Dance Revolution 2, which has... Let's see if...
I'm so out of the loop on DDR stuff.
I'm kind of ashamed of myself.
I like it already.
It's a little bit repetitive here in the beginning.
It's good stuff.
That's not Vanilla Ice.
Hold on.
It does not sound like Vanilla Ice.
Actually, I kind of like it.
That sounds pretty good.
I love Des Rho, so... Wait a minute, isn't... There's a song called Say a Prayer, Des Rho featuring Maxi Priest.
Isn't Maxi Priest the guy from Faithless?
No, that's Maxi Jazz.
Maxi Priest is, I think, is a reggae singer.
Yeah.
Okay, I was like, I know I knew that name somewhere.
Maxi Priest did, um, there was a song that came out, like, in... Oh, yeah.
He's a British guy of Jamaican descent.
Huh.
But there was, like, that big single that came out, um... Close to You was the biggest song he had.
Huh.
Wow, so I didn't realize Desro was doing all these big collaborations.
I want to know if they're Konami in-house or not.
I'm sure the chat room is like screaming it out here.
I'm not really paying attention to chat.
A little chat.
Anyhow, sorry, I know you didn't call in to talk about the Xbox game, but now you know, right?
And knowing is half the battle.
Exactly, exactly.
All right, well, anything else you want to talk about with us tonight, Ranma?
It depends.
You want me on the phone for another five, six minutes?
Why?
What's it about?
Let's see.
I have a couple of other topics pretty much.
All right.
Let's try to do one more quick one.
Okay.
This is a quick one.
This turned into like a giant 100th poster on my friend's Facebook.
There was a discussion about this.
Do you believe that using a strategy guide is cheating in a game?
My personal opinion, it's not.
It's not cheating, but there's certainly a reward to some people for being able to do it without it.
For some people, it's more rewarding to do it without it, but not everybody gets that same sense of satisfaction.
I definitely used to be one of those people that's like, scoff, I don't need a stinking strategy guide to get through this game.
Don't insult my intelligence.
But now I'm like, eh, whatever.
Get out the iPhone.
Let's pull up GameFAQs and do that.
I found it.
For the record.
Desro is one of the many aliases of Osamu Migitera, along with D.Crew, PositiveMA, and MTO.
DesQ represents a collaboration of him and Taku.
Wow.
Osamu is known by his trademark hard rock sound and hard-hitting beats.
His songs have appeared in pop and music, Beatmania, Beatmania 2DX, Guitar Freakstormania, and Dance Dance Revolution.
Some strategy guides have cheats in them.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Who cares?
If it's a single-player game, cheat all you want.
You're the one that chooses how to spend your $60.
If you want to get there the hard way and get those rewards, then yay.
But if you want to just cheat your way through it and get all the video in it or whatever, then yay.
Whatever you need to do.
It's in MMOs.
But then, of course, they have strategy guides for MMOs, but I don't consider a Warcraft strategy guide cheating.
They bundle it in the Deluxe Edition.
Yeah.
would Blizzard allow that if it was cheating?
it's not cheating, it's just maps and shit and tips I said this and I walked away using a strategy guide or game guide is not cheating when you hack the game that's when you're cheating
I agree with that and I think we'll leave it at that.
Ranma, thanks so much for your call tonight.
Hey, no problem.
Take care, buddy.
You too.
Stay fabulous.
I will.
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Go ahead and give us a call.
We got time for at least like one more call.
Get in here.
Meanwhile, oh, I had more tweets.
There was at least one.
We didn't get a lot of tweets tonight.
I'm a little bit disappointed in you tweeters.
We will read one more from Tigerclaw, though.
Tigerclaw is always... You can always count on certain things in life.
You can count on taxes.
You can count on getting ripped off from vending machines.
And you can count on Tigerclaw posting two stories for the OLR Twitter every night, every Sunday.
All right.
Korea...
is considering a move that would block minors from playing online games for over three hours.
This is something Tiger Call linked us from Gamasutra.
The South Korea Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology is reviewing a policy that would ban minors' accounts if they play games for more than two hours consecutively or a total of three hours in a day.
What would you think of that?
What do you think about banning kids straight up from playing games?
We ban you!
Wasn't Ragnarok Online a Korean company?
By the way, there already is a law that prevents children under 18 from playing online games during the late nights, but this would be something else kind of new.
I'm trying to read through some of these quotes here.
If the game industry is really a troublemaker, then the related government should discuss it and provide guidelines to instruct us.
That was from a game industry representative who's trying to fight this.
Interesting.
Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
I'd like to do Zaku here.
Hey, Zaku, how you doing?
Pretty good actually, just resting up right now, getting ready for tomorrow's gruelish work week.
Tomorrow is a Monday.
Yeah, case of the Mondays, yeah.
Alright, anyways, aside from not calling in a while, I've been busy building a new PC, getting Battlefield 3 up and running, and just spending most of my time on that.
It's alright, I've been busy having pink eye like a three year old.
I wonder if you can still spread it over the internet.
Probably not.
Let's not find out.
But yeah, I guess aside from playing Battlefield 3, I kind of noticed that this whole spat on having to include online passes in games and the fact that Curt Schilling's video game company is still trying to do damage control over how they ended up describing it.
It brings up a fundamental shift in the fact that this wasn't the case several years ago, even in the previous generation.
Japan was the only country that really had it out for used games, to the point where, if I recall correctly, a Supreme Court decision over there paved the way for retailers to actually sell used games.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
I myself, I mean, I try not to buy, I try to buy it new, but if for some reason there's no compelling reason whatsoever to get it that quickly, I may just opt for a used copy like most of the other games I bought.
Most of them are just used second hands, except for the ones that I bought new, like Forza 4.
That was definitely worth buying just because of the value added.
The fact that it was something that they offered up not only just an impressive card list, but just some really good DLC off the bat.
But then you also get really mediocre games in which the only way they can really try to draw in people is to try to offer DLC that will make up for a lackluster game.
Yeah, I'm trying to think of a recent example of that.
And I know I'm thinking there's something that just came to my mind where DLC kind of helped add stuff in a game that was kind of lackluster.
I don't know.
Because once technology gets better to the point where Microsoft could actually pull off a system that detects used game copies, then to the point where it may not be viable to even sell any of those copies anymore.
That's assuming the system is successful.
And I think the consumer base at large will reject a system with those types of restrictions in place.
Then again, unless of course those restrictions are like you can't play used copies at all, which would be suicide for that manufacturer anyways.
But something that basically, instead of having a paper print out of an online passcode, something that gets activated for that particular account.
You know, like if you run the disc once and you need like an account, I guess like a gold account or something on Xbox Live where it would detect...
You already ran this particular copy of the game and you get that online pass.
So any other person running that game afterwards for a different account will have to pay.
So something like that, which takes a sting out of a draconian system that would just prevent used games from playing at all.
It's also insulting when I pay $60 for the game and I'm paying this premium.
I get with $0.99 or $1.99 games.
That's a digital license or whatever.
But with $60, I want my physical copy that I can take to a friend's house.
It's just ridiculous.
At some point, the consumers are going to say no to that.
So I think that whole thing was a load of bullshit anyway.
So why was the PSP Go not successful?
Well, I guess it's a factor in the sense that it was all digital.
Like people want, and you're right, you do bring up a point of having to...
I only buy on the sale unless I really need to have that copy.
I bought Civilization 5 at full price, that's it
Right now, I'm going to have to buy Skyrim full price because you know what?
The sale was not low enough in the sense that I could probably pick it up cheap later on, but if I wanted to play it right now, I would have to suck it up.
Same thing with Battlefield 3.
I bought that full price.
It was Origin, but nevertheless, I bought it.
I didn't wait for it to go on sale.
I wanted to play that now, and I still haven't bought the expansion pack yet.
I just want to point out, you don't have to shop around a little bit, because Steam is charging $59.99 still, I think, but I looked at Amazon, $47.46.
Well, that's the thing, Battlefield 3 is only on Origin, anything other than Steam.
Remember that whole spat where EA wanted to, because of what Valve set up in their terms, that they took most of their games away out of Steam and into Origin?
Yeah, but why get a digital copy then?
well because it sucks having you know it doesn't make a difference if it's activated through Origin because that's where all EA games are going you know at this rate so even if I have a digital copy it will only be tied to my Origin account just like Steam alright I gotta wrap up and let you go buddy but we'll hope that gaming manufacturers get the right idea of what we really want
Yeah, definitely.
Have a good one.
Alright, you too, buddy.
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
We're running a little bit over tonight, so we're going to wrap it up and get on out of here.
But first, I want to go around and see if there's any last minute stories, DarkSakura or Loki.
Meh.
Nothing I really wanted to talk about.
No?
I don't know.
Like, DarkSakura, you wanted me to mention there was some gaming chair, not even really a gaming chair, but like some PC pod chair thing that, you know, that someone's trying to sell.
It's really expensive and sort of looks like, you know, some immersion rig from, you know, Ready Player One or something, but...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I saw that.
It's expensive.
And there was another story that he posted that was interesting about the whole world record.
Somebody spent like 40 hours trying to beat some DDR record and got denied by Guinness.
But it was a little bit too busy of a news week to fit something like that in, especially DDRs.
I saw one that was also – what was it?
Jimmy Kimmel – or not Jimmy Kimmel.
Jimmy Fallon did some really stupid record a while back where most consoles played in a minute.
I don't even know how you arbitrarily do that.
Press A, press A, press A. It's not even.
They had to do something for a second.
I don't even know what the requirements were.
It's like WarioWare in real life.
It's stupid, but then someone else apparently beat their record or they claimed to beat their record with 13 consoles played.
I don't know.
It's dumb.
You can't have a record on that.
What are you going to say that constitutes playing?
Just like pushing pause?
Pushing A?
I don't know.
We have had 16 consoles on in my house before.
Well, you need to do WarioWare IRL where you just run around all those and do something for a second on each one.
All right, we're going to go around, wrap up the show, and get everybody's final thoughts.
So where do we start?
DarkSakura, thank you for being here as always.
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
Al.
I'm going to go have some strudel.
Delicious.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
I really should play some more LittleBigPlanet 2.
I agree with that.
I hear that.
I just probably won't.
My final thought tonight is wow, wow, wow.
More wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.
We really appreciate it.

So, you know, thanks.
Leave us a nice review on iTunes to hopefully counter some of those one-star reviews that were threatened by...
folks at Loki earlier this evening.
Say nice things about us on the internet and help spread the word.
We really appreciate it.
It goes a long way to grow the OL Army, our little family here.
Thanks again, you guys, so much for staying up late and listening to Orange Launch Radio.
That's going to do it for another episode.
We'll be back next week to talk about the news.
Big games coming out this week for those that are getting them.
