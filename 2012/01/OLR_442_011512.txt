Tonight, January 15, 2012, Kid Icarus Uprising will come with a bundled accessory, a new PC gaming tablet as shown at CES, and can Apple iOS gaming actually save your life?
DarkSakura.com
She unexpectedly had something come up where she is in San Francisco tonight doing some friend stuff, so she's not here.
So sadly, she will not be joining us tonight, but we always like an excuse to say hello to Salacious Pop, who's filling in tonight.
As always, as usual.
Who's kind of become the Joan Rivers of our show, the always fill-in host when Johnny Carson was gone.
That reference is way too old for any of our listeners.
If I tried to hide in the office while you were recording, I'd just get knock, knock, knock.
The show only has two people tonight.
You have to help.
Do you really want this show to be a complete failure?
Actually, no.
Loki and I have done a show alone before, but it's more fun with three.
It was fantastic.
Three's a crowd.
Oh, yes, there he is.
Tech Master Loki is here tonight.
I'm here.
How are you doing, Loki?
Thankfully, Alan came to the rescue with barbecue sauce because McDonald's...
If the sauces have green covers, they must be the same, right?
Because habanero is just exactly the same as sweet and sour sauce.
And of course, always joining us, our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at all games radio, www.
Allgames.com
Let's see, and going to our live chat room, who's always with us, Tigerclaw starts us off saying, oh, tonight's show is a sausage fest?
I guess, if you want to look at it that way, but we will have chatter, comments, and I know there's some lovely ladies that chat with the show, and then of course Twitter, and hopefully phone calls later, so, you know, it'll be ladies night on the Skype line, hopefully, we'll get some women to call in, but you know what?
No matter what your gender is, we're all gamers.
That's what it's about here.
Video games, the gamer lifestyle, and the show where every gamer has a voice.
Tonight, before we get into our gaming weeks, we usually do a little bit of topics at the start of the show.
We're up against the Golden Globes tonight.
It seems like having a show on a Sunday, we're always up against some stupid award show.
Oh, that's tonight?
I totally didn't even realize.
I didn't know either.
Yes, the Golden Globes is tonight.
Honestly, guys, are you really going to watch this show?
Just read it tomorrow like everybody else.
I will say this.
The whole Ricky Jervis thing where he's a total asshole.
It's funny.
He just says what everybody's thinking.
That part will be cool, but I know that all the good zingers will be in the news tomorrow.
Is he hosting, I'm assuming?
Oh, yeah.
Remember that whole thing?
He's not going to come back to host.
He was disrespectful, and he did not represent our point of view.
and it's like, oh shit, people love it when he trolls.
Oh shit, highest fucking ratings in like 10 years.
Dude, seriously, if you want your show to have great ratings, just fucking get Neil Patrick Harris to host it, okay?
He can host anything.
Well, that's the Tonys, but yeah.
I don't care, he can host anything and he's awesome.
I will tie this into gaming, I promise.
Over the weekend, Alan and I have a New Year's resolution this year, actually.
Or I should say, Alan has a New Year's resolution that I've been, and we use this term at work, voluntold.
That's where you didn't volunteer for it, you got voluntold.
So I got voluntold for this New Year's resolution, but I liked it, so I went along with it.
So what is the New Year's resolution?
It's something I've done in 07 or 08 that worked really well, and it's to just see one movie in theaters a month, regardless of what's out.
One movie a month in theaters.
Yep.
So...
and that's good because last year we saw like two movies the entire year.
We saw Tangled and Black Swan and those were both done by February and we didn't see a whole other movie until a year later.
I got my movie for February already but I haven't gotten the chance I'm definitely going to go see it or sneak out to see it.
Wait, are you doing the one movie a month thing too?
No, but there's a movie in February I want to see.
What is that?
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I swear I have never heard of that ever.
I'll find you a trailer.
It's really cool looking.
Okay, interesting.
No, I think our February movie we already decided is going to be the borrower's Miyazaki version.
Yeah, the Studio Ghibli.
Ghibli.
Beauty and the Beast 3D
with all the football games this weekend yeah but you know come on it's Disney and you know how I feel about Disney and Beauty and the Beast really is one of the better you know Disney movies they did kind of part of that whole 90s renaissance so they did the whole 3D thing and we took our friend Victoria who I think was on the show a long time ago none of you guys probably remember her but we all went and for three of us it cost $51 to see Beauty and the Beast 3D
Was the 3D worth it?
DarkSakura,
But, oh my gosh, there's like this rush of 3D movies coming out this year that are all just fucking 2D conversions.
Okay, I remember the name of the movie now.
Chronicle.
I haven't heard of it.
I guess I'm just... This is why we need to see more movies.
We can do an awesome bit of radio here and I can show you the trailer.
This is what happens when Dark Sakura is not here.
When it becomes a sausage fest, we can't stay on the topic of games.
Now it's the movie show.
Okay, well, I was happy the fact, because, I mean, I don't know if you read, they were talking about doing a live-action Akira, you know, it was going to be terrible, because it was going to be in the United States, and just made no sense whatsoever.
But this actually looks pretty cool.
And let's see here.
Okay, well, before I get to that, let's see, Shesaro in our chatroom says, $51, fuck that shit.
I would require to see some of Belle's Disney titties.
No.
There were no titties.
It's a Disney movie.
Come on.
Am I really going to watch this live on air?
Am I really derailing this show?
Because you know I was trying to turn this all into a 3D games chat, but hold on here.
Let's go back in and look.
Alright, I'm looking at this trailer.
This is a two minute trailer.
I can't watch all this.
It's going to derail the show too much.
We'll just watch part of it.
So what, is this all shot like Blair Witch Project style?
Not exactly, because they... The guy that's doing this is using some common sense, figuring out, you know, in this day and age, people know how to operate a camera.
Oh, I see.
So it's more like people with their own iPhones.
Whoa, that was like a Furoda moment there, right there.
So they're making a teddy bear dance with telekinetic powers and freaking out a little girl.
Now they're moving a car with their mind.
Maybe fast forward it a little bit.
Okay, so it's a movie about bros that get magneto powers, basically, right?
This looks...
Whatever.
Alright, sure.
I think it looks cool.
Whatever.
Whatever.
I'll get it on Netflix if nothing else.
Alright, what I want to... Okay, so yes, my point was, before I got so rudely derailed, they're converting all of this 2D stuff into 3D because there were how many previews before we saw Beauty and the Beast?
Like, eleventy billion, right?
Yeah.
And it's Finding Nemo, back in theaters.
Star Wars Episode 1 back in theaters.
Finding Nemo.
Titanic back in theaters.
Okay, Titanic is stupid.
But Finding Nemo makes sense because it's all CG.
Just re-render for two points of view.
And the 3D will probably be pretty good on that.
Yeah.
Finding Nemo, I'll give a little bit of a pass.
But I'm not paying $51 to see it again.
I'm sorry.
It'll be on Blu-ray.
I could buy the Blu-ray for half that.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
So I'm kind of â€“
TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says it's Cloverfield but with super powered teens.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Do you agree, Alan?
I do.
It was just kind of like, it looked like it was kind of post-production stuff.
I mean, and I can't imagine how terrible the ones from the 70s are going to look with the whole post-3D.
So, I mean, I guess cool that it's back in theaters for those that want to see it in 2D, but ugh.
Anyway, my point was, now we're getting into more 3D games, right?
And like 3D is kind of where gaming is going.
And my thought is, inevitably...
Inevitably, there's going to be a point where we're going to start seeing games re-released in 3D.
Wait for it, because we had the Halo Anniversary Edition this year, which was the high-definition remake of classic games.
That's where the industry is right now.
We get all these...
High Definition Remakes.
There's a little bit of clarification though there.
There's some HD remakes that are kind of cool where they take the game, remake it in a whole new engine.
It's all new assets.
That's fine.
A new art department.
Or the Final Fantasy X, which despite how you may or may not feel about Final Fantasy X in the series, the fact that they've come out and said they are remaking it.
It is not an uprest.
Okay.
Now, like stuff, for example, the Metal Gear Solid collection or the, like even the God of War stuff is not really a new, I mean, mainly the Metal Gear Solid stuff because that looked really blurry and kind of weird.
Or there's that Silent Hill one coming out in March that's really weird because it's kind of just up-rezzing but they had to do all new voice acting because of the
Legal Troubles that one of the guys in the prior voice cast did.
Silent Hill is dead.
I mean, seriously, that series, I can guarantee the new game's going to be terrible.
I mean, it's not what it used to be.
They try and they try, and they try to figure out what people want, and it's just, they get it wrong every time.
GameGuru in our chatroom says, RadRacer, I almost said RidgeRacer, RidgeRacer.
I'm sure that'll be in 3D at some point too, but he's saying RadRacer 3D?
3D World Runner 3D World Runner
Not red, blue, but they do like the other type of glasses.
They have that available, and they also have actual 3D.
Yeah.
But yeah, it's the... But although, that technique is supposed to be to the point where the colors don't get all messed up from it.
I don't know if that's true or not, but apparently the glasses, I haven't actually used them, are supposed to preserve the colors so that even though it is the green and kind of magenta, it's still okay.
Yeah.
So how long do you guys think before 3D remakes become a big craze?
And let's not forget, this is already happening.
If you doubt what we're saying, remember what was the big thing on the 3DS last year?
Zelda 3D was like the only thing on that console worth having for a while.
And of course there was the Star Fox remake as well.
So they're already starting.
But they're not even really necessarily putting that game in the 3D.
It's just, once again, it's a new camera.
I don't think they're going to be that popular because people don't really care about 3D on consoles right now.
They have it there so they can kind of say, hey, look, we support 3D and stuff.
But it's not mainstream yet to where everybody has 3D TVs and everything.
Because even the 3D TVs, I mean, the content out there is not very good so far.
So I don't think it's going to be a major trend.
You will see a ton more HD collections, though.
Everything is going to be fucking taken and put into HD, if you will.
Yeah, but especially when we get into the next series of consoles, is 3D inevitable?
Like, is 3D gaming really the future?
Eventually, but I don't think it's going to be something that they... I don't know, they may release a bunch of stuff for it.
Why not?
Alan, you look like you're dying to comment.
I think that it should be available with the next generation of consoles but if they just say this is it like telling the consumers what they want rather than just seeing what the consumers want themselves I don't care about 3D games because you've got the TV and the glasses and all that horse shit it's like stop it
Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Kaijudo says, I have a 3D video convert and I watched the Star Wars movies in 3D.
Episode 3 looked good with all the crazy colors.
You mean those Blu-rays are already in 3D?
I mean, the other thing about Beauty and the Beast, that shit's been on 3D Blu-ray since November.
And when I found that out, I was like, oh, well that was...
You know that some HDTVs already, the 3D HDTVs, will convert 2D stuff into 3D.
Oh my gosh.
But a lot of it sucks.
Alpha Canandagram says they did smooth the heck out of Zelda 3D.
Well, they better, I mean, it's gonna be on a, it'd look like shit if they didn't do something to it.
Stuff on the N64 was so fucking ugly, I don't care how nostalgic you are for the game, it was an ugly system, the games on it look like shit.
It doesn't matter though, I mean, that system's old, and that system was meant for, you know, standard definition TVs, and of course you have the scan lines and everything, so, you would better do something to it, because it'll look like crap.
Let's see, Kaijudo in our chatroom says, they make way too many bucks in the video industry to really care about Alpha Cananogram 3D.
I don't know why he said it that way.
I think Alpha Cananogram must have made another comment earlier.
But I was thinking, wait a minute, I don't know if the video games industry is necessarily doing that well.
I mean, I know we've heard about the movie industry was in a little bit of a slump this last year.
Of course, there wasn't a lot of great, great movies outside of, you know, like what the Harry Potter and, you know, a couple other things here and there.
that people really wanted to see.
But video games, I seem to recall reading a story this week that December did not treat the gaming industry very well, especially if your name was Nintendo Wii.
Nintendo Wii, specifically.
I guess 3DS obviously has made a huge rebound, but Nintendo Wii, as we all figured would happen.
What is there on the Wii right now?
There was no title for it this Christmas, and they paid for it.
Well, here's the... No, they had Fortune Street, to be fair.
They had Fortune Street.
Like I said, they had no title on it this... I mean...
It came out two weeks after Zelda, so what do you need?
Oh, that's right, they had Skyward Sword.
Now I sound like an idiot.
I forgot they had Skyward Sword.
But for real, it got lost amongst the Skyrim, the Saints Row, it was a huge year this year.
Well, here's the thing, too.
One game wasn't enough.
I gotta tell you, here's the thing.
The Wii, not a lot of stuff coming out for it.
I mean, yeah, they've announced Mario Party 7 and Rhythm Heaven Fever, but those are the Nintendo first party stuff.
Third party, there is not much for the Wii right now.
There's a bunch of games that have been delayed forever that are just still floating around.
But, I mean, if you look at the release list as far as Wii titles are concerned...
Thanks for watching!
PlayStation 2 stuff anymore, but they did one last year.
And actually, they did an original Xbox in 2010, even though that system had been done for a while.
And the PSP is going the same way too.
So the PSP is going to drop off the face of the earth this year, and obviously PlayStation 2 already is, but I think the Wii is going to drop pretty fast.
It's going to be gone by the time the Wii U comes out.
Or at least...
I mean, they may be putting out a couple things, but it's going to go kind of the way the PlayStation 2 is right now.
It's going to be like Disney Channel games and, you know, just kiddie stuff.
Well, not even necessarily that.
It's like really, really small third parties.
And that's all that really have, like, yeah, like Kokum, Oxygen Games, you know, Crave.
They have a few games coming out.
But they're, I mean, I don't know when they're coming out because they keep getting delayed and delayed and delayed.
Yeah.
but it's not anything really mainstream although like I said Nintendo does have Mario Party 7 which is kind of like eh and Rhythm Heaven Fever which I know some people are looking forward to but it's not anything like a mainstream appeal Mario Party will have a mainstream appeal but Rhythm Heaven most people could skip that
Alright, as if I didn't look like a big enough idiot forgetting about Zelda, I have a little correction to make here.
Shane's listening and he's a huge Silent Hill fan and linked me to this thing that's on the Silent Hill Facebook.
Apparently, the original voices will still be in the Silent Hill collection for Silent Hill 2.
And you're going to be able to switch back and forth between original voices and new voices.
But Silent Hill 3 will only have the new voices.
But they will be, I mean...
In my opinion, 2 was the better game, but I know 3 has its huge fans.
3 was a great game, too.
And they say in their official little release here on Facebook, quote, Unfortunately, due to factors both technical and logistical, Silent Hill 3 will be presented with new voices only.
Yeah, technical and logistical.
And legal.
Cha-ching!
Money!
But there you go.
All right.
Anyhow, enough talk about 3D and all that stuff.
Let's move on.
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the stuff that we have been playing this week.
Usually DarkSakura starts us off, so I'll let SalaciousPop go.
I'm sorry, Alan.
I keep forgetting you go by your name now and not an online name.
Well, it's just too wordy to say over the air.
Fair enough.
The two big games I'm playing right now, aside from WoW, and I am playing a little bit more WoW than I was, is Skyrim and Dragon Age 2.
I'm trying to juggle between the two of those.
since I got the DSi XL for Christmas I've also been playing oddly enough Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass the you know the the touch the stylus only controls are actually really good they do a good job on it I have the little feather shaped stylus as the pre-order bonus so I got it when it was brand new and I'm only just now playing it it's like five year old game six year old game
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and I did cheat to give myself gold because I could not take being broke and always being in my inventory cap anymore.
So clearly you're a PC player.
Yeah.
Have you experimented with any of those mods like the ones that are supposed to enhance your performance?
Yeah, I have a world map replacer that shows me where all the roads are in a way that isn't like all fakey and it's not too obtrusive looking.
So I've got a map replacer for the world map so I don't get quite as lost.
Which is cheating.
Well, yeah.
That is absolutely cheating.
Out of the way.
So yeah, I have a map replacer and the best add-on for Skyrim, and it sucks that console users can't do this.
Your favorites, like the spells and the items and the weapons that you put the little star by so you can just do your quick select menu.
There's an add-on for that that organizes everything.
And then also just a bag manager so I can sort stuff by weight and see like...
why am I always at my weight cap what the fuck do I have that's so heavy and then I can sort by oh these only weigh a pound but I have 70 of them so I can put that at the top and then sell them off that's what happens when you collect cheese wheels yeah
and the bug that I had that I mentioned on last week's show did fix itself I think I mentioned that too where everyone in Dragon's Reach hated me and thought I was a murderous criminal but yet the guards in the town were like sup bro what you doing like your armor bro and then and then the Jarl and his little dark elf bodyguard were like fucking get him and I'm like I didn't do anything this game is bugged as hell yeah that's fine now
VidPower in our chatroom says, performance enhancing mods.
It's the steroids of Skyrim.
That's a good comparison.
I haven't used the dev console in any way to give myself stats or points or skills or anything.
I got myself enough gold to buy a house with some chest in it to throw my shit in and that's it.
Did you fuck Lydia yet?
No, I don't have a spouse.
You know you can buy that house without actually spending the money.
Oh really?
See, I don't want to use the exploits or the invisible chest either.
I'd rather just give myself 20k gold and then I'm done.
Hey, if they didn't want me using that, they could patch that out right away.
But apparently they still want me to use it.
I think part of the fun, I think they realize that part of the fun with a sandbox game like Skyrim is people hacking it and fucking with it, so I don't think Bethesda's going to patch that out.
If people are having fun with it, they don't care.
It's not an online game.
That's probably a big part of the reason why they're not going MMO with it, at least right now.
I think it's inevitable there's an Elder Scrolls MMO Oh my god, that would be the buggiest piece of shit ever It's gonna be a beta test for six years Yeah, right, like they'll beta test anything with that It's good You sure?
Did you check?
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good And Dragon Age 2 is awesome, but it's hard to juggle two meaty games like DA2 and Skyrim Alright, let's move on to Loki Loki, how was your gaming week?
My game of the week is pretty good.
I just played Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Skyrim.
Skyrim I'll mainly talk about because no one wants to hear about Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
I have to say one of the best weapons in the game, I don't know if you've come across this yet, Alan, but the Wabbajack.
The Wabbajack is awesome.
Wapjack is a staff that casts or transforms things into random things.
So, for example, you can cast it on people and the first time I hit somebody with it, it kind of went all Scott Pilgrim and they exploded into coins.
Nice.
Thanks for watching!
and then, uh, actually the quest to get that was also really weird, which is pretty fun.
Um, but, yeah, the game is still really glitchy for me.
I just gave up on that one quest that I can't get to the person because they're under the map.
Um, it's just like, well, there's no way to get this person, so, uh, the hell with this.
And, um,
I don't know, I'm still having fun with it.
I'm level 41, I think?
Maybe a little further along than that.
I don't know, but I have... I think I capped out a few different skills already.
My blacksmithing, I know.
Alchemy and some other stuff, but...
It's still fun.
I just didn't play any this weekend, although I probably will tonight.
But yeah, still wasting tons of time in the game.
I think I have 90 hours in it now.
All right.
Anything else?
No, that's all I played this week.
Thank you for watching!
I don't want to say rip-off, because I called it that somewhere else, and somebody was like, it's not a rip-off, it's more inspired by it.
I'm like, okay, but it really is like Zelda.
So fine, inspired by Zelda.
I'm sorry, I did remember one thing I played.
Oh, shut up.
All right, what?
Mole Cart for the iOS.
Oh, God.
All right, that's coming up in the show later, so hold off, yeah.
All right, let's see.
What else did I play this week?
I played, I will say on the new front, I did check out that Final Fantasy XIII 2 demo, like I think a lot of you guys have, because that's one of the...
Big things that's holding people over right now that came out on the Marketplace this week.
I really liked the demo.
But of course, disclaimer, I also really liked Final Fantasy XIII, and I realized the gamer populace as a whole had its problems with it for being too linear.
It was too linear, and there's no towns, and you only have to do one thing.
And the character design is da-da-da-da.
Although, if you... I mean, and I get it.
I'm not excusing it, but I just will say, if you stick with the game, you will find that Vanille has multiple layers to her.
She is not all he-he girl.
Like, there's definitely a past there that...
I need to go and finish Lost Odyssey.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
to Crystallarium.
Much easier and not as big of a pain in the ass.
You know, it's much easier to use.
Hey look, townspeople, where you can talk to random people and they'll tell you things and it kind of feels like a town and you have multiple places you can go.
Like they're definitely trying to sneak all this in the demo.
And then on top of that, you know,
I found it interesting that your party is actually only two people and your third character is that monster and your monster can be one of three monsters but the monsters all fall into one of the different categories like Sentinel or Commando or Ravager if you're familiar with Final Fantasy XIII these are kind of the character classes
So it's kind of like a build your own third character is really what it feels like to get the types of paradigms that you want.
Which, you know, I fucking love the battle system in XIII.
That's one of its huge strengths.
And Final Fantasy XIII too is really just expanding on that with letting you kind of even go further with the paradigms.
And I know this character has her haters, but I will say Chocolina is amazing.
Yeah.
Chocolina is like half Vegas showgirl, half Chocobo cosplayer at a dinky anime con.
It's like Carnival in Argentina or something, or Rio de Janeiro.
It's pretty bad.
And she has a voice actor like this, and she just sounds like she's so happy.
I was dying.
And I immediately went on all my Warcraft servers and reserved the name Chocolina for future use, possibly with Pandarins later on.
Um, so I guess that was really about it.
I'm trying to think if there was anything else.
Um, DS, I went back and started playing Retro Game Challenge on the DS again.
Because, you know, again, I was kind of revisiting old games I wanted to play again.
And Retro Game Challenge was an awesome DS game.
Especially if you liked, you know, 8-bit classics.
So, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
So, let's go to, I'm trying to see if our, in the chat room at chat.orangelunchradio.com.
Hitstun in our chat room says, I thought the full game was out already.
January 31st is the full game.
Yeah, very close.
Same day as Soul Calibur 5, right?
Yep.
It's going to be a busy week.
Same day as Never Dead also.
Ooh, busy week, busy week.
Um, yeah, it gets, it's weird, it kind of gets busy for, actually starting from the 31st, which is very unusual.
February has a lot of big games.
All the delayed games.
Oh, Mass Effect in February, right?
No, it's March.
Oh, March, wow.
Dang, it's gonna, it's gonna get busy.
Yeah, it's, February is, uh, Binary Domain, um, Twisted Metal, uh, UFC 3, um, no, I'm thinking, forgetting a ton of shit.
Um,
SSX, I'm looking forward to SSX
All the way to Chapter 11.
it's not that same feeling like in Final Fantasy 7 when you get out of Midgar and then all of a sudden holy shit world map like it's not that great but I get the sense that Final Fantasy 13 2 is going to start with that kind of chapter 11 feeling right up front and I'm not talking about bankruptcy so I'm really excited about the game I already have mine pre-ordered and now I'm realizing shit I gotta get I have to get a PlayStation Vita and I have to get Soul Calibur 5 I'm gonna be broke you don't have to why do
Because I want it.
Because he makes bad choices.
Let me guess, because you want Luminous, right?
Yeah.
It's not a launch title.
Oh.
It's not?
I thought it was.
Nope.
Maybe I'll wait until Luminous is out then.
Just give it some time.
I mean, because if they're talking about it bombing as quickly as they think it is, you might want to wait just a little bit.
All right.
All right.
We'll see.
We'll see.
All right.
In fact, Luminous isn't even on their release list yet for Ubisoft.
Alright, let's move on.
Some quick housekeeping going on tonight.
Of course, follow us on Twitter and Facebook.
Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
You can follow us on there and we'll give you little previews on what's coming up on the night show and so forth.
Also, our website, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
We are in early talks about talking about some upgrades for the website for this year.
That's really awesome, especially the forums.
We really want to, and somebody was commenting on Facebook today about the forums and like
Forums need to get cleaned up.
We're like, yeah, we know.
We really want to make that workable again.
So I hope you guys will be ready for that when it's done, which hopefully will be in the next month.
That'll be cool.
And I'm going to plug the spinoff show Horde House if you like World of Warcraft.
We have a whole other show about World of Warcraft, but it's not that serious, just like this show.
Hordehouse.com if you want to check that out.
H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E dot com.
I think that's everything I wanted to plug tonight?
I guess so.
So let's get into some gaming news.
Loki.
I guess truly it's conflicting information.
Amazon's saying it is a launch title, but Ubisoft's not.
Whatever.
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the Vita since we were just talking about the Vita.
One of the things that was announced during CES was Music Unlimited was going to be something that's going to be featured on the Vita when it launches here in North America.
and of course that's Sony's cloud-based music service that I think they actually have on the PlayStation 3 right now as well.
One of the other things that they did announce as well is a kind of a video editor called Play Memories and that's going to be for the PlayStation 3 and I also believe the Vita as well which is kind of neat.
Oh, maybe only the PS3.
I thought it was also on the Vita.
Hmm.
Um, and they'll allow you to manipulate photos and videos through the PS3.
I thought they had a video editor.
I thought they had one that came with the iCamera that you could download.
I thought they had something very basic too, but this sounds like... Maybe this is a little bit better than that.
Maybe a version 2.0 or something.
Okay.
And, of course, some sales numbers came out as well.
The Vita sold 500,000 units in Japan.
And, of course, they're saying that also we're going to be expecting Netflix to be coming to it as well near launch in Europe and the United States.
Not a big surprise.
Netflix is on everything, so...
It would be kind of lost if it wasn't on the Vita as well.
So, not a big surprise there.
Also, the data plans for the Vita, if you buy the 3G version, have come out.
18, he's going to charge you $14.99 a month.
And this is, of course, no contract.
$14.99 if you want 250 megabytes per month.
And $25 per month if you want 2 gigabyte cap.
and honestly, I mean, since you're not going to be using 3G to download games because that'd be so fucking slow, I would recommend, I don't know, I'd recommend not getting the 3G version to be honest.
Just save some money and just...
There's some folks in the chat room.
Taiki in chat says, I'm going for broke.
3G all in.
Alpha Cananogram in 3D says, getting 3G for the hell of it.
GPS.
Okay.
GPS.
Then why not... I would just recommend getting a...
Game like a virgin mobile phone or something like that.
I pay $25 a month.
Unlimited data.
It's also 3G.
And it's a phone.
So, and if you root it, you can tether to it.
So, nah, I get 3G anyways.
But yeah, if you want to get the 3G version, more power to you, I guess.
But that's what it's going to cost you.
All right.
I was trying to look up how the 3DS sold when it originally came out in Japan.
Because, you know, a lot of people are really dogging on the Vita and its sales numbers.
But how did it compare to the 3DS?
Because the 3DS had a lot of growing pains too.
You know, obviously that was kind of a very slow build.
So, I mean, is it really fair to be razzing on the Vita when the 3DS had its share of launch problems?
I mean, not hardware necessarily, but, you know, just quality of software.
I think I teased you that you want to get the Vita on launch day because it's important to you that they lower the price of the Vita six months later.
Then have an ambassador program where you get fucking Crash Bandicoot and they're like, that's all the vintage shit we have.
Sorry, thanks.
Here you go.
So you can be mad about something else.
I would hope for a Final Fantasy game, but I guess that's the wrong company.
It's got to be a first party.
So, all right.
Also going to our chat room at chat.orangelaunchery.com, Rama says, if you're smart, get the Vita from AT&T.
It'll be $99 with a two-year contract.
Really?
Is that true?
I didn't hear about that.
Sounds interesting.
It's probably speculation because there's no contracts for it.
Maybe there's an arrangement that AT&T could have, though.
Ranma says, tether off your smartphones, people.
STO Under Matt says, I don't see the point of the 3G since it's Wi-Fi everywhere.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Alright, anyhow.
Let's talk about some PC gaming.
Obviously, one big PC game we're going to get at some point in 2012 is Diablo 3.
Now, there was a very interesting kind of controversy this week with Diablo 3 where Bashyok, one of the community managers for Blizzard, posted on Twitter essentially that Diablo 3 was confirmed for consoles.
He didn't say that, but he did...
Answer a user question saying, oh, well, that's already in the works and so-and-so is the manager behind it, basically.
So it pretty much confirmed without confirming it that there is a version in the works.
But then Blizzard came back and quickly kind of revoked that tweet saying, you know, we have no announcement on that at this time, but...
Come on, people.
We've known for forever.
Blizzard's been hiring the people for consoles.
They're at least exploring a Diablo 3.
They'll probably do it.
But my question is with the real money auction house, how in the hell is that going to work on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network?
Because I can't see that they're going to be able to run something like that on those services.
And that's going to be a huge moneymaker for Diablo 3 and essentially fund the whole online multiplayer part of it.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Very good at that tonight, by the way.
Yeah, I was going back to what you were saying about the 3DS.
Now, how often or how far from launch were you talking about for numbers?
I guess, well, it's been a couple, okay.
So within the first, I'd say, week, they sold 282,000 units.
In the U.S.
or Japan?
This is Japan.
Okay, all right.
Fair enough.
So, in about a week.
So, yeah, they're a little ahead.
Alright, that's fair.
So, but it isn't millions, you know, but, okay, so it did a lot.
It's the 3DS.
It had some more people.
Yeah, it launched in February, or towards the end of February, and by the end of March, they were about 800,000 yens in Japan.
Alright, so 3DS was ahead.
Alright, also on the Diablo 3 front, one other thing I wanted to say is that one fact that could be holding up the game, or people have been speculating to hold up the game, from a global launch that Blizzard has insisted on doing, is the ratings in South Korea.
The game has not been able to be rated in South Korea for forever, and a lot of that is because of the Real Money Auction House.
Well, the news came out this week that Diablo 3 was officially rated.
It's rated 18+, according to the game's rating board page.
and so that means that now it's been rated everywhere so Blizzard, how about a release date?
Unless there is truly something else holding up the release of this game that is highly anticipated.
Anyone else looking forward to Diablo 3 or is it just me?
Of course I'm getting a free one thanks to the Warcraft Blood Pact.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
I saw it pop up on one of the new communities on LiveJournal I've been following is ONTD Games because now ONO they didn't have a games community and the story popped up on there like it was new news and it was sourced to a site that had just run it this week so I think Blizzard is putting it out there again for whatever reason but yeah you can still sign up for it so hey if you want to tell Blizzard you're going to give them money every month for 12 months I think they're going to let you do it I just think the rewards are going to change at some point
And for the record, no, I'm not excited about Diablo 3.
But you never really played Diablo 2, did you?
I played Diablo 1.
I like Diablo 1.
Why not the 3 then?
I don't play that much on PC.
It doesn't seem like... Right now, I'm doing a lot of looting and grinding in Skyrim, and that kind of fulfills my need for doing looting and grinding.
I don't need another game to do that.
Shane, by the way, looked up the whole Luminous thing in private message.
It's coming out February 22nd is the release date.
So it's launch window, like that first month.
Let's put it this way.
It's not on Ubisoft's release list yet.
I still think that's tentative.
I don't think that it's actually coming out that day yet.
I would trust Ubisoft and their information, you know.
because they just sent us the update about Ghost Recon being delayed to May.
But it's not on the release list.
I will ask this week, though, because I was curious on that myself, especially since they have box art now.
That usually means that's close.
And the song list in Luminous looks hot.
And they could very well say, oh, yeah, here, it's coming out on the 14th or 22nd or whatever.
All right, let's move on.
Alan, what do you got for us?
XBOX LIVE ARCADE HOUSE PARTY 2012
Yeah, it's the same thing.
It's the same thing in the winter.
Yeah, so the 2012 of the Hurrah!
Our XBLA is so awesome.
It's going to start on February 15th with the titles Alan Wake's American Nightmare, The Long-Awaited I Am Alive, EA's Warp, and a game that's name is spelled so confusingly I think it's just deliberately there to troll.
It's N-E-X-U-I-Z, which I'm calling Nezui's.
Nexes, maybe?
I think it's Nexes.
I like Nexuese, though.
It makes it sound exquisite.
Those four games, we don't really have prices yet point-wise on what they're going to be, but February 15th is when those four games are going to drop and all that goes down.
Also, there's a part of this for Windows 7 mobile operating systems for the Windows 7 phones, the smartphones that Windows put out.
Everyone has either an iPhone or an Android, so whatever.
There's also a bunch of games coming out for that as well.
If you're also among one of those people that plays games for Windows Live,
Somebody?
Anybody?
I still have Game Room on Games for Windows Live.
I don't remember the last time I touched it, but it's there.
Aren't you glad you bought those games?
Shut up.
House Party starts February 15th of those four games.
Is there any buy four, get one free?
If you buy all four of those games, get $100 stolen from your Xbox account?
I've checked a few sites, including Major Nelson's blog post, and no, it doesn't really seem that way.
Hmm.
And this one's supposed to be geared more towards teenagers and stuff, because hence their edgy commercial that they had in there.
Ooh, edgy.
Well, edgy being that there's teenagers having a house party, you know.
Because, you know, everybody has a house party.
I'm sorry.
Hey, I'm going to grab the liquor and we're going to play Xbox Live Arcade.
Your house party is invalid.
No, no.
Your house party is invalid without kid and play.
Okay.
Let's be real.
That is true.
If you want a house party, Microsoft, if you want a house party people are going to pay attention to, you need to find out whatever the fuck happened to Kid and Play.
I'm sure one of them is not dead, but... One of them's got to be alive somewhere and desperate for money.
I'm going to Wikipedia right now.
I want to know what happened to Kid and Play.
They do have also, there's a game from Double Fine coming out for the Kinect that's like, I don't even remember what the fuck they're calling it, but it's just a bunch of little Kinect mini games for...
You know, from Double Fine.
But it almost surprised me a lot of that was the Kinect... What are the free shit that they put out?
Fun Labs?
It's like that, but paid.
On June 23, 2010, Kid and Play appeared on Lopez Tonight and performed Rollin' with Kid and Play from their album Too Hype.
At a 2010 Tribeca Film Festival, Kid stated that Play and I also have a television series in the works, so the future is bright.
I'd watch that.
Ha ha ha!
How fucking old are Kid and Play now?
Let me look at this up here.
Kid was born in 64, so he's 47.
I bet he could still get down.
Also in Xbox news, Microsoft has released the sales numbers, which they haven't done since October.
And it sounds like 66 million units sold worldwide as of this press release they put out.
And by units, they mean stolen Xbox Live accounts.
The last time they... Funny enough, half of them were sold in Poland, and we can't figure out why.
Yeah.
uh then that's roughly 10 million more than the 55 56 million they said that they had sold worldwide at the end of October so 10 million over one holiday season
The Kinect now is at 18 million units, which I don't know what the numbers are for the move, but I'm pretty sure it's not 18 million.
It's probably not 18 million.
You can never really get accurate numbers of the move because they count every single little accessory.
They sell you the starter kit.
Oh, look, we've sold you three move units or four move units.
Number of Kinect games worth it for those 18 million people?
Two.
It's growing.
It's slowed down, obviously.
It's plateaued since the insane launch week that Kinect had, but 18 million units is a very respectable number.
Also, they've come out and said that live accounts that are in service, which means that people have just configured a live account and they log into it, not necessarily gold, but live accounts is nearly 40 million users, which is about 60% of the worldwide sold.
60% of Xbox users have live in some capacity even if it's not gold they're not paying for it now where's the number about how many of those accounts are still uncompromised because that's what I'd like to know so as far as those 40 million silver versus gold it doesn't say but 60% is pretty reasonable I think
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know.
It's interesting.
VidPower actually links an article he found that's related saying that as part of the house party promotion, if you buy all four games, you will get 800 Microsoft points free, which is like, what, a quarter of a FIFA gold pack?
I see what you did there.
It's like 20%.
There you go.
All right.
Moving on, Loki.
Okay.
So, of course, there was rumors that, oh, the new systems, PlayStation and Xbox, are going to be at E3.
Well, it's too soon at least for the PlayStation.
According to Kaz Harai, PlayStation 4 will not be at E3.
They have no plans on bringing it out at E3.
And it says, you know, we're not making announcements at E3.
Okay.
I do want to just say, I told you so last week on the show, but to be fair, pretty much everybody was thinking that this would be the case.
It didn't take Miss Cleo to figure that out, that there was not going to be a PlayStation 4 at this next E3.
I think what it's going to be, I think it'll be at least a year after, and honestly, I mean, I know that they're kind of like, okay, whoever's first out of the gate is going to have the best chances as far as it goes.
I think that Nintendo's going to be stumbling out of the gate, to be honest, and I don't think they're really going to have to play much catch-up, and
Besides, give it another year and they can copy whatever works well on Nintendo's system.
I could sort of see Microsoft announcing a new console, but they don't have to.
Because you're right, I think they can give Nintendo a chance to eat dirt a little bit, maybe.
But Microsoft, especially after the story that Alan just read about that the sales numbers are still good, Microsoft still... If they could get those one or two killer Kinect games...
and I'm talking something better than that Star Wars thing that still isn't out.
If they could get those one or two Killer Connect titles that even the hardcore gamers must have, I think they're going to have it.
Now here's a real question about Sony and I think this is a much better question.
So if you want to play games analyst for a minute, those of you listening, here's a real question for you.
How much emphasis will still be on the Sony move this year?
I think that's a real question to ask about E3 is that will Sony give up
Just like maybe they did on the, well, I guess the PlayStation Eye kind of turned into the move, but, you know, will PlayStation decide to give up on the move a little bit now that they're going to have the Vita out, and maybe we'll focus on that a little more?
Or are they really still going to push the move as an alternative to the Kinect and to the Wii?
That's a question for you.
I think
Well, they've kind of succeeded in a few avenues there.
One, they've got better integration with their motion control stuff into their core games than Microsoft does.
I mean, because, hands down, the move for Resistance and Killzone and SOCOM and stuff like that, it actually seems like it would work.
Versus Voice Commands to Throw a Grenade in Halo, which seems very tacked on.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Okay, I have to go to chat room with this comment.
Kaijudo in our chat room says, Microsoft needs a new system.
That thing is dead.
With all due respect, did you not hear what Alan just said?
Like, about the sales figures.
And, dude, I get what you're saying.
Like, you know, especially after the whole hack crap, you know how I feel about the Xbox.
And I get what you're saying.
But I think Microsoft, let me kind of give you an analogy.
Microsoft is right now, especially with the Kinect,
sitting kind of where Nintendo was about three years ago.
Where the core gamers, like yourself and some of us, weren't taking them so seriously.
Yet they were still slaying with sales figures because the families were adopting them.
And I think that's kind of where Kinect is right now.
Like, maybe they're losing a lot of core gamers, but they're still selling systems.
And you can't call it dead because of that.
I don't think they're losing core gamers at all.
I mean, in fact, I think that Kinect's working well.
To be fair, I don't think they are either.
But...
I think the PlayStation 3 is gaining a lot of ground I think it's not that the Xbox is running away with core gamers but I think a lot of core gamers are now looking at the PlayStation 3 going, huh, maybe I want one of those
Thanks for watching!
and then they have their core gamers that are playing their franchises and stuff that they keep putting out.
And they've tried to get people excited that are playing core games to buy the Kinect with Forza 4 stuff and with Halo but honestly it's just such a poor attempt at tacking that stuff on that's not really accomplishing what they're hoping to accomplish.
They're trying to get people to kind of
Thanks for watching!
It's just it's not working right now because what they've done for these core games to implement Kinect functionality is really cheap, and it shows.
I guess going back to the original question about the PlayStation Move, I guess you will always have those games that are ported to the Move from the Kinect.
I mean, even though the two technologies are kind of different.
Like, certainly you get the games like Just Dance that they adapt for both.
I think you'll still see a lot of stuff like that.
I think it's doing well, though.
Yeah, I think so.
All right, anyhow, let's move on.
Talking about other releases and things coming out.
Another fighting game is going to be repackaged with all the download content, and you might have heard, it is Mortal Kombat.
Mortal Kombat Complete Edition, of course, complete with a K, is coming out all over again.
It is going to have the original game, all of the DLC packs, so including Freddy.
It's going to have Mortal Kombat, songs inspired by the Warriors.
Is that that old-ass...
I think it might be.
Or it might be the new one.
I don't know.
They have a new soundtrack.
But if it's that old CD, that's awesome.
I don't know.
Also, you get a download code of the 1995 Mortal Kombat film, which was decent for a video game movie because a lot of them aren't very good.
But the original Mortal Kombat movie was kind of awesome.
It was alright.
And then the sequel was bad.
The sequel was bad.
It was really bad.
Yeah.
The TV show was even worse.
Was there ever a third movie?
There was talk about a third movie, but they just never did it.
I think they're still doing it.
It's a little late now.
Well, now that the whole resurgence, I guess there was those YouTube videos that really weren't bad.
So, anyhow, it is coming out on February 28th, the Mortal Kombat Complete Edition, both on the 360 and the PlayStation 3.
So, if you're like me and you never downloaded any of the DLC, this may be of value to you.
I don't know.
I probably won't get it.
I don't need the 1995 film that bad, and the DLC, if I want it, I can probably download cheaper.
Ask yourself, do you like renting stuff?
Do you?
I mean, seriously, do you guys like renting stuff?
Because Warner Brothers says, fuck you, because they don't like people that rent ship.
They're going to push the window out to 56 days.
And also, I wonder if there's going to be the online pass.
For listeners that don't know, explain the...
56 day window basically Warner Brothers right now they had implemented a 28 day window to basically block anybody that rents movies from buying directly from them if they want to buy stuff to put in their store they have to go out to Walmart or retail or Amazon or wherever and buy them and put them on well technically they could sell you the product directly later on but you know it's
Now it's a 56-day window, and so Netflix is not going to have it until 56 days later.
But Redbox, they're like, well, fuck it, we're just going to go buy it at the store, as is Blockbuster.
Blockbuster, those are the big three that were kind of affected by it.
and also you know you may like your Harry Potter well as of you know last year at the end of the last year they're all out of circulation now they're they took all the movies out of circulation so they can go re-release them like Disney does basically Warner hates people fucking 3D they're gonna release all the Harry Potter movies in 3D wait for it well it wasn't the
Warner Brothers fucking hates people that do not buy their movies.
They want to basically take everybody out of rental to buy their stuff and to stream their stuff using their ultraviolet service is what they're looking to do.
Which isn't going to work because they're diluting it out there.
All these companies think they can build their own Netflix.
It's just not going to work.
If that's the kind of thing you want to support, then by all means...
I remember when this shit was going on with VHS movies.
Video stores would get it before everybody else.
Hold on, Ranma, you're talking about the reverse.
You're talking about the total reverse.
What used to happen then, I used to work at a video store way back when, those VHS tapes used to cost like $99 when they first came out.
That's why.
It was rental and sell-through.
They basically had rental movies would come out at one point, then eventually the studio would drop the price to sell-through because, I mean, yeah, you can go buy the movie the same day that it comes to the rental stores, but it's going to cost you $100 or $150 to buy that movie.
Yeah.
But then they had programs.
Warner's tried a bunch of things.
They've tried distributing their own movies and that didn't work.
They tried these programs.
Trust me, working in the distribution business, it's fun.
All right, let's move on, Alan.
Mad Catz has released the latest line of the Fight Stick controllers they're putting out for Capcom's Street Fighter X Tekken.
They've done a redesign of it.
There's two different models now, the Fight Stick Pro and the Arcade Fight Stick Versus Edition.
The latter, which aside from having, I think, more detailed art on the top panel of it,
is a there is it comes with an accessory if you have two of them you can snap them together and basically make a mock like arcade board where you have two people standing side by side like they were fighting at a real arcade in case you want to sit a little closer to your friend yeah so if you can find a way to get like a table and put this up up there you can then have two people for like for you know tournaments that you want to host
Get you to buy two of them instead of one.
Yeah, exactly.
And there's also going to be a Fight Pad SD, which is going to be 15% smaller roughly than the previous Fight Pads that they've put out.
And they don't have a price point or release date yet for either of these products, whether it be the new Fight Pad or the Arcade Sticks.
but they are aiming for a to be congruous with the March 6th release of the game itself and I have a little side story about this all right I remember in February of 09 when Street Fighter 4 came out not Super Street Fighter 4 but the original one I wanted one of the fight pads Mad Catz and I have it right here Rob if you could hand that to me
I paid so much for this.
So whenever I hear that Capcom keeps giving MadCatz their exclusive license for the fight sticks and the arcade whatever, I'm like, MadCatz products suck.
But that just happens.
The stuff comes dead out of the box.
It can be anything.
He's mad, damn it.
I was going to say, Loki, before I throw it out, if you want to fuck with it, it's here.
If you want to take it home and open it, I don't know.
But that's all.
Loki, fix it.
I know.
Techmaster Loki.
Read between the lines.
Techmaster Loki, fix it.
Where's the thingy?
Loki's evaluating it.
Well, first off, you're missing the breakaway part of the cable here.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Anyway, yeah, just go to Kotaku or Joystick if you want to see what the fight sticks look like.
All right.
Let's move on to release dates.
We're going to travel the world and check out some upcoming releases coming soon.
to a game store near you.
I hope you like Gran Turismo and I hope they haven't bought Gran Turismo 5 because that's really that's all coming out this week Gran Turismo 5 again yes Gran Turismo 5 XL edition it includes now this is kind of cool it includes all the well the spec 2.0 update and a voucher for $20 worth of DLC and it's only 40 bucks
Okay, that's cool.
So, I mean, it's not bad.
I am terrible at, like, Gran Turismo and the realistic racers, but that's a good deal.
That's neat.
Yeah, I mean, it's not bad.
And My Pet Puppy 3D for the 3DS from 505 Games.
That is it.
My Pet Puppy!
It was funny.
This week, there was actually supposed to be games coming out, but nothing came out.
It was a dead week.
Nothing.
Wait, what do you mean games were supposed to come out and then they didn't?
Like, a bunch of delayed stuff?
Yeah, there was two games that were supposed to come out this week, and both of them got delayed.
What games?
This week was supposed to be 4-1 Action Pack from South Peak or something like that.
A bunch of really terrible PlayStation Network games.
And then there was the National Geographic Challenge, which got delayed to the 24th.
You know, I'm thinking even if those games were coming out, you would have said this week was uneventful.
I'm just saying.
Just saying.
Alright, going to Japan.
Real quick though, one release I wanted to say that's not on this list because it's an Xbox Live thing.
DLC for Saints Row the Third, the first in the season pass, it will be released this week, Genki Bowl 7, which I am excited to play.
Alright, let's move to the Japanese release dates Which are a little more exciting on the Xbox 360 to start us off Dead Rising 2 gets a price reduction in Japan I think some folks may be excited about this Onichanbara Z Kagura comes out this week in Japan So I think this is like a sequel to the original Onichanbara Which if you didn't know what that game was It's basically women with big titties slaying zombies It is a woman wearing lingerie and a cowboy hat With a samurai sword killing zombies That's right
and how like in other words the formula for a perfect game yet it doesn't end up on any end of the year best list it's not really yeah it's kind of one of those on paper it sounded awesome it's it's part of the simple series the simple series had a really weird they had a lineup of games that was just so up some of them were just like casual games some of them were really weird
Earth Defense Force was part of the simple series in Japan on the PlayStation 2.
This was also part of the series.
One that I wish that would come over here or at least make a sequel to is Zombies vs. Ambulance.
It's an ambulance and you run over zombies with the ambulance.
And they also had another one that was like some chicks in dresses maids with like mini guns killing zombies.
A lot of zombie killing.
I like games that are over the top.
Why can't we get more of them?
It was just ridiculous.
That's why I thought Saints Row was really awesome actually.
Also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Power Up Heroes and Red Dead Redemption Complete Edition.
All of those coming out on January 19th.
Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, some of the same stuff.
Dead Rising 2, Red Dead Redemption Complete Edition, getting the price reductions.
But there are some new things this week, including Nobunaga no Yabu Tendo.
That is actually, again, a price reduction.
As well as Trinity Zil-O-Zero.
All of those games I just mentioned, PlayStation 3 best hits.
Next big release for Japan on PlayStation 3 is probably Armored Core 5 but that's on the 26th so you still have a little ways to go before that is out.
Keep in mind the PlayStation Vita is already out in Japan so they are getting this week Wipeout 2048 on the Vita.
Makes its way to Japan this week.
I believe that's a launch title for us over here.
the Wii really doesn't have a lot there's a price reduction of Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes and I'm quickly looking to see if the PSP or no 3DS Labyrinth no Kanata and Rhythm Kaito R Kotei Napoleon no Isan comes out from Sega this week trying to see if that's a that's Rhythm Thief I believe
Yes, it is.
Yeah, Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's Treasure.
It's the Japanese version of that.
And Runabout 3D Drive Impossible.
So kind of a bigger week of 3DS.
Whoa, hold on a second.
Who's that from?
Rocket Company?
Runabout 3D Drive Impossible.
Yes!
Runabout's fucking awesome.
I have not heard of this series.
Runabout's been around since the original PlayStation.
It came out over here as Felony 179.
And it's basically a game where you drive around and smash into stuff with your car and cause damage.
Oh yeah, I can see that from the screenshots.
It looks like you can drive a tank in one of them.
That's a pretty fun game.
Oh, interesting.
I wouldn't give it another second thought.
Very cool.
Yuki in our chatroom says, I thought it was a Dreamcast game.
Of course, that could be a delay.
Yuki might be commenting on another game we mentioned.
Runabout was also a Dreamcast game, I believe, as well.
It was Dreamcast and PlayStation 1.
Maybe PlayStation 2.
It was really simple graphics.
Well, it comes back in 3D this week.
No, it's PlayStation 1, for sure.
Let's move on with the UK releases.
Two games.
Wednesday the 18th we're going to get Haunt for the 360 and Scary Girl for the 360.
Which are download titles.
Boring week over there in the UK.
Hope you enjoy what you got already.
And Scary Girl I guess is a graphic novel tie-in and it's a Squeenix produced game.
It's a fighting game, I believe.
If I'm not mistaken, Haunt is a Nana Onsha game.
The folks that made Parappa the Rapper.
But don't expect it to be a music game.
Yeah, it's not a music game.
I thought Scary Girl was a fighting game.
But there was some other fighting game that was coming out that was like that.
It might not have been Scary Girl, I don't remember.
DarkSakura.com
and Kid Icarus is going to be supporting that as well.
They're going to be getting a left-handed mode with the Circle Pad Pro which looks kind of awkward.
I don't know how that would be holding that.
For the record, now I'm really pissed off that that Circle Pad Pro thing is a GameStop exclusive because Alan's left-handed.
He could actually use that because I'll probably buy that game and he could kind of use that mode but I'm not going to GameStop, period.
Um...
Thanks for watching!
It's hard on your hands anyway, so they're going to be coming out with a stand, if you will, for the 3DS that will be included with Kickerous Uprising, because apparently the game is so uncomfortable to play on the 3DS it requires a stand, making it not really a portable system anymore, but...
Yes, apparently touching the screen works better if it's secured, according to Nintendo.
That's kind of weird.
Weird to bundle a peripheral like that with Kid Icarus.
To me, that screams design flaw right there.
We have to be getting a new 3DS to C3.
Here's what it is.
It's because you have to touch the screen or whatever, and it just doesn't work.
If you've played even Metroid Prime, 3D Hunters or whatever it was,
The original DS Kind of had that same type of setup Where you would move with the directional pad And you used your right hand with the stylus To kind of look around And it was fucking uncomfortable to play that game So this, kind of the same thing But now you use an analog stick instead It would be easier if you could aim Like if you had the Circle Pad Pro Aim with the right analog And move with the left And then you wouldn't need the touch screen But then what's the point?
Now, Alan, you've had your share of challenges with the 3DS.
What do you think about some of this news?
If you get it, I'll use it.
I don't know.
You're just not that excited about the 3DS to begin with?
Pretty much.
When they release the second generation of the hardware, I will give a shit.
But I'm a late adopter on purpose with Nintendo.
I'm holding my 3DS right now with one hand, kind of moving the analog stick.
Even just holding it for a few seconds is uncomfortable.
and pushing on the screen as well as I'm trying to it really starts to put a kink in my wrist there.
I would think they would have to come up with some better way of doing that.
Mario Kart is the biggest culprit because you have to hold down the accelerator and that makes my hand cramp really bad after like one track other games on the 3DS or like the purely stylus based ones are fine I will bet you anything the next 3DS we get is going to be an XL because the problem right now is everyone is saying it's too small and it cramps people's hands up that they're going to make it bigger so they can put the extra analog stick on there and it'll be an XL system I will bet you
All right.
Well, moving on.
Speaking of Mario Kart, sort of.
An interesting new game hit the iPhone, iOS, iTouch, and all that store this week.
It's called Mole Kart.
And, you know, it's kind of common these days that you see these iOS games that are very similar to games that are out there.
In fact, you might remember last week...
We were talking about kind of the same subject With Atari going after all these people Well, Nintendo may want to consider going after this game Because what makes it unique is that While they don't use Mario And that a lot of the characters are different A lot of the tracks are lifted right out of Mario Kart A lot of them, all of them
All of them are taken right from Mario Kart.
Like, the whole bouncy mushroom race thing that was huge on the Wii is in there.
Now, you played this, Loki.
I haven't even bothered to play it, but you actually got it.
Yes, I got it.
Not bought it.
And, yes, it's a complete rip-off of Mario Kart.
The thing, though, see, I don't like, once again, I don't like kart racers on the iPod because I just don't like tilt controls.
It really pisses me off.
But even, I mean, look at even the main screen here.
We have a complete ripoff of the bomb in the corner there.
Item mode, they call it.
So, yeah, they break it up.
You start off with two characters.
You can unlock two more by playing the game, and you can buy two more on top of that.
And, of course, you get Mole Man and some bear.
So, anyways, the different things that they have starting off, you have the Mole Pasture, which I want to say it's one of the tracks from the Wii game.
I don't remember its...
X Mushroom
It's definitely one of the tracks from the game.
Then you can unlock the FrigÃ© port, which is definitely one of the tracks from the Wii game.
Volcano, which is one of the old classic tracks, the Bowser Castle tracks from the Super Nintendo game that they remade the 3D in the Wii version that's in there.
Sky Remnant is another track that I think you can buy.
Um...
and then Arctic Glaciers is the ice track from Nintendo 64 version that was up-res and then Mole's Garden was Peach's, I think it's Peach's Garden or something like that or Daisy's Garden.
So in other words, it's a damn rip-off.
Yeah, everything's a rip-off.
So rather than being just, it's the same genre, because last week you were saying that companies go after third-party things that say, oh, you're copying our game, but it's like, no, it's just the same genre.
They copy the tracks.
The tracks are the same.
So this would be a valid lawsuit.
Yes.
All the power-ups are, you know, oh, this is not quite a bullet bill.
It's something different, but all the power-ups are the same.
I mean, they have all the power-ups.
But doesn't the quality of stuff like this kind of speak for itself?
It's not bad.
SmurfsVillageMolesWorld
How the hell do I play this?
It's automatic acceleration.
You have a break, and then you tilt to move.
I just move backwards.
Should I hold your mic up to your face for you?
Okay, hold it.
Yeah, sure.
I'm playing.
This game is kind of basic.
How do I use it?
Oh, you tap the item.
Yeah, you tap the item, too.
Okay, I just got a flaming pear as a power-up, and there's cows standing in the middle of the course, just like on the Wii one.
and the flaming pears I'm assuming are like the mushroom yeah because it gave me a little turbo boost and I can't drive for shit this game I mean it's one of those things where it's like I would show my friends haha look at this Mario Kart ripoff but I mean is it really worth what is this a pineapple okay it's an oh it's the it's the use it all you want nitro the frame rate on this sucks
Moomoo Meadows it's even on the fucking banner it says Moomoo Meadows on the fucking banner you know I'm thinking the developers kind of forgot that you might want to change some things that are on the track way to go
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Ah, that's fantastic.
Well, because you know, you know they're doing it in some, you know, very tiny cubicle, high production supervisor glaring down everyone's necks environment where they just, just take this track and copy it, you know, just bit by bit, detail by detail.
And so they copied it.
That's fantastic.
Good job.
Alright, let's take a moment to take a trek down memory lane.
Remember when the only game that was getting ripped off was Street Fighter 2?
Fighting Street?
Let's take a trip down memory lane.
Remember in the groove.
Alright.
Every week, DarkSakura likes to dive into the vault and pick a game that she thinks is worthy of being the classic game of the week.
But she's not here.
So instead of the classic gaming vault, we have the classic gaming cardboard box.
and Alan has dived in, thumb first, into the Classic Gaming box and pulled out a game that he thinks, hey, shows some respect.
This is a true classic right here.
Alan, what is the Classic Game of the Week this week?
This week's Classic Game is the original Half-Life.
I'm so surprised.
Release 1998.
I'm so surprised at this coming from you.
Yes, I know.
It's never been a classic game of the week, and reality check, this game is, what, 13 years old at this point?
Yes.
Half-Life was made by two former Microsoft employees, Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell, whose name might ring a few bells.
They bought the package to modify the Quake engine.
and they hacked the shit out of it to design this game and by the time they were done the Quake engine had grown into something called Gold Source which is how Source which was the big engine that Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead is based off of that's how they got that name so the original Half-Life was a modified Quake engine game it was published by believe it or not Sierra Entertainment or what Sierra Online had become before it finally closed after they made all the King's Quest and Space Quest games
So yeah, developed by Valve.
You know, a little company you might have heard of.
Published by Sierra Online and it was released...
November 19th of 1998 on the Windows PC platform.
And of course, anyone who remembers the 90s know that as far as first-person shooters go, there were the two big titles, Wolfenstein 3D, which set the place for Doom, which set the place for Duke Nukem 3D.
What Half-Life did differently and how...
Here's the par time.
Here's your time.
Yeah.
Half-Life was just like a big... I mean, it just kept going and going.
There were little chapter marks, so when you got to a certain plot point in the game and you uncovered a new area, a subtitle would say, you know, Chapter 2, Office Complex, so you know that you're progressing through the story.
But other than that, it was like a big ant farm.
You were in Black Mesa, which was a military, industrial, private firm that made, like, nuclear weapons for the government.
Um...
in Arizona, and you play Gordon Freeman, a physicist who is doing an experiment on some alien moon rock that is given to him in strange circumstances, and when he does a test on it, a dimensional rip from an alien world, a hostile alien world, opens in.
All these aliens pour out and it turns out that they were working on portal technology, like the game Portal, which came much later.
And while developing this portal stuff, they accidentally tapped into an evil alien overworld and critters showed up.
Oh no, it's Critters!
It's one of the best-rated first-person shooters of all time.
I think it's got a 97 or 98 on Metacritic.
The other big thing, which was unprecedented at the time, was that the Marine soldiers that come in in Chapter 4 or 5 to kill you, they actually had an AI, believe it or not.
Because the demons in Doom and the aliens in Duke Nukem 3D were pretty...
Dumb, you know, you could hide behind cover, you just run out and shoot them.
In Half-Life, if you ducked for cover, the computer would know to tell the NPCs to then throw a grenade, and the aiming on the grenade was accurate, so you'd be hiding behind a box or around a corner, and you would see a grenade, and it's like, oh, shit, and no one had ever played a game that hard before, where you had to actually think about how to go about killing your enemies.
Half-Life was also very different where there wasn't really multiplayer, which was really big in that day.
Or was there co-op?
It came later.
There was Half-Life Deathmatch and also Counter-Strike, which is the biggest.
That's also a hack of the Gold Source engine when Valve opened up.
Thank you for watching!
The opening of Half-Life is Gordon Freeman getting into the tram.
It's in the morning.
He's going to his day at work.
And you don't really get to control your character at all.
It's about a two or three minute intro where you're just on this tram going through the Black Mesa facility.
And what it's kind of doing is showing you...
Thanks for watching!
the designer of Bioshock if you remember the intro of Bioshock where you the plane crash lands and you're in the water and you go into the lighthouse and you're in the bathysphere and you see Rapture the City that is inspired by the tram sequence in Half-Life it's exactly a direct homage to what Half-Life did
There were a few flaws, of course, with Half-Life.
There were a lot of bullshit weapons in it that you never use.
There were like 15 different weapons.
You only needed like five of them.
Way too long, especially since the last chapter of the game, you go to the alien world to kill the big brain fetus.
That part was really ugly and it had a lot of first-person platforming where you have to jump on shit or else you fall off and die.
Even today, in 2012, you put jumping puzzles in a first-person shooter, people are like, fuck, no, this is stupid.
I don't want to do this.
Half-Life, near the end of its cycle, had a ton of that stuff.
So it wasn't without its flaws.
I believe it's also one of the as far as PC exclusive shooters the best selling this may not be true any longer but there was a point where if you bought a new sound card you got a free copy of Half-Life if you bought a graphics card or a new computer like you go to Circuit City and you get the package deal well now it's download Steam and Half-Life will cost 50 cents at some point so an absurd amount of millions of units sold in this game
and Half-Life 2 of course came out in 2004 launched the Steam store platform which of course no one knew at the time what the fuck that was and now Steam is totally integral to PC gaming and without any of this we would have never had Portal or Portal 2 our game of the year this last year Aperture Science which is the main company and Portal is hinted at as being in bidding wars with the government against Black Mesa
and always losing so they're kind of like the shitty little kid brother of Black Mesa anything else you want to say about Half-Life?
it's awesome I do a full playthrough of it at least once or twice a year it's hard as hell I can't honestly beat it without using a god mode code for at least some parts of it but it's definitely awesome and if you like first person shooters you want to know what all the hype is about when people lose their shit about where is Half-Life 3 god damn it
Play this and figure out, oh, okay, I can see why I'd want more of this.
But do keep in mind the game is 12 years old at this point.
Yes.
but there's been newer versions there's a fan community project that's pretty much vaporware called Black Mesa Source which was, it's not related to Valve at all but Valve has absolutely given it it's given them their blessing a complete reskin of Half-Life with completely redrawn textures like a total remake of it that hasn't come out yet and it's been planned for like 5 or 6 years
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week this week.
Half-Life, released originally in 98 for the PC.
Get your crowbars.
All right.
All right.
We're going to take a quick break, guys, but we'll be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
There's still more to come.
We've got some rapid-fire news coming your way, FUs of the Week, the mailbag, and more announcements and things of that sort.
So don't go anywhere, guys.
We'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on this January the 15th of 2012 with the 442nd episode of our program.
Of course we are taping live as we always do every week at All Games Radio.
Allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Blackwolf.
And we've talked a lot in...
Diablo 3, Mortal Kombat Complete Edition
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Umlautsf.com
I do ask if you are going to watch the hour and a half long pre-show for about the first 20 minutes just skip all the segments to have me until about 20 minutes in because unfortunately there was some audio snafu and I think I have a Jessica Simpson moment but you know what it's live things like that happen we've had our share of LOL WTF moments here on Orange Lounge Radio like remember when the entire soundboard fell over that was a good time
So anyhow, big thanks once again to Umlaut for asking me to be a part of that, including, of course, the wonderful Seg, who I think is in our chat room.
I saw him there earlier.
Hello, Seg.
And the other guys that put the pre-show together, the whole folks at the AV Society, very professional folks, and my fellow co-hosts on that show, Carnage and Wes, both from Destructoid, were great and did very well with all the interviews and everything.
So lots and lots of interviews and folks.
Okay.
Okay, so again, that's YouTube user UmlautSF.
And by the way, you can still donate.
So you can still, if you forgot, if you're like, oops, I meant to donate, but you know, December was a rough month.
Well, you can still donate.
So I don't think it'll go to this year's tally, but it will go to a good cause.
And that's the very important part.
All right.
Let's move on with some rapid fire news.
Some other game news going on there this week.
Loki.
Yes.
So let's start things off talking a little bit about Saints Row the Third.
This is kind of cool.
This is something that I know I heard about a while ago because it was announced by CheapAssGamer because it involves TPD.
But CheapAssGamer.
DarkSakura.com
You know, have the season pass.
Or you can get it for free using the Genki Bowl 7 viewer pack, which allows you to get all the DLC portions to be able to play co-op with someone that has that DLC if you choose not to buy it.
And, of course, the only catch is that you need to get to the point in the game where you're at the first save house, which doesn't take that long because that's when you get homies.
But, uh...
Even I'm at that point.
If I could play that long, if a game could hold my attention that long, you could do it too.
It's pretty awesome, and he does have a bunch of unique lines, apparently, in the game.
We got popcorn over here?
Would you like popcorn?
It's plain popcorn, though.
That's fine.
It's gross.
It's pretty bad popcorn.
I eat low-fat or the low-butter popcorn sometimes.
Of course, I couldn't find that at the store, so I have regular butter now.
All right.
Oh, wow, that is plain.
Yeah, apparently... You just sold the hell out of that.
From what I heard about CheapyD, I think he won some type of auction thing and did all that.
Oh, yeah, maybe.
Yeah, it was like a charity thing.
If I knew about that auction, I would have... He paid like $2,000.
I don't know if it made the news tonight because I think it might be kind of late breaking and I really apologize.
I'm like scanning over the upcoming stories.
There's rumors going around about THQ that apparently they're in trouble right now and they're selling off or something about all of the projects coming out in 2014 for THQ have been canceled and they're trying to prepare the company to be sold.
I don't think they're in trouble.
Yeah, pretty good.
I mean, where does a rumor like that come from?
An industry insider.
Well, I know that, but who would make something like that up?
That's a weird rumor to make up.
Well, it still weighs off.
I mean, 2014.
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe they're just... Who are they going to be bought by?
EA.
or Activision.
Who else?
Who else buys up gaming companies?
I don't see them going that way right now.
Hell, there's companies that have a worse time than they do.
Sometimes you get surprised.
PopCap.
Why did PopCap sell?
They were doing great.
I mean, look at Capcom.
Capcom didn't do that great.
I mean, they have Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, but I don't think that sold tons.
I mean, I don't know.
They didn't really have any big games.
I mean, Warner Brothers had Batman, so that helped, but they didn't have Batman.
Harry Potter?
Lego Harry Potter?
I don't think so.
All right, let's move on.
Alright, and some other cool stuff.
Dark Souls.
There's hopefully a chance that it'll be coming to PC.
And of course, the admin for the Dark Souls
They responded to a request for a PC version and basically said There's always a possibility to have games adapted on PC And the good news is Dark Souls is not a 100% typical console game So the option is possible Now to make things happen, let's say the demand has to be properly done Someone make a successful petition And so there is a petition right now, you can sign it
it has currently around 37,000 signatures and if it hits some arbitrary number then maybe there'll be a Dark Souls PC game
SILENT HILL
I'm sorry, March 13th.
And then the HD Collection will be coming out on March 6th.
And then on the Vita, Book of Memories will be coming out March 27th.
So it's a whole month full of Silent Hill, whether that be a good or bad thing.
Alright.
We talked a little bit about Silent Hill already earlier in the show.
What, another movie too?
Isn't there supposed to be another movie?
There's supposed to be another movie, but I mean... I thought they announced they were filming it.
The movie wasn't terrible.
The first one was alright.
I really liked the first movie.
Yeah.
It was good.
Just...
Man, the last game that they put out was not very good, and this one I'm not sure if it's going to be very good either.
And I don't know if, was it Frozen Memories?
Wasn't that one of the Wii?
I don't know if that was any good either.
It was a lot of running.
Alright, moving on.
This isn't necessarily about video gaming, but it's about a game that influences a lot of shit in video gaming, and that is Dungeons & Dragons.
There's some big news this week about Dungeons & Dragons that's a little bit controversial.
Wizards of the Coast is working on a new edition of Dungeons & Dragons which is kind of weird to me in a way like it seems like they're pumping these out faster than versions of Google Chrome all of a sudden like wasn't the original version of D&D in the 70s and then they had one in the 80s or like no when did second edition was all the way in the 90s there was D&D and then there was a D&D remember there was advanced and then they consolidated those two brands so there was a tricky other version in there yeah okay
D&D D&D D&D
User input, quote,
In short, we want a game that is as simple or as complex as you please.
It's action focused on combat, intrigue, and exploration as you desire.
We want a game that is unmistakably D&D, but one that can easily become your D&D.
The game that you want to run and play.
That is from their official announcement that they sent out earlier this week.
And they say, by involving you in the process, we can build a set of D&D rules that incorporate the wants and desires of D&D gamers around the world.
So, they are going to, I guess, at least are claiming that they're going to be user input in a lot of features of this game.
Wasn't there supposed to be a lot of user input in Mega Man Legends 3 too?
And look where that got.
Womp womp.
No, but I'm not.
You know, obviously D&D is a classic game, but it's going to be very interesting to see what direction it gets taken in.
I mean, you would think the people that play it regularly would know a lot, but sometimes, I don't know, like I go to World of Warcraft, which obviously heavily influenced by D&D, right?
World of Warcraft almost listened too much to its vocal fan base in this latest one.
Like Cataclysm really kind of catered to a lot of the very vocal people, and because of that, it's the weakest expansion.
D&D needs more T&A
I want to get drunk.
If there's any chicks there, I want to do them.
Mr. Sparkle
And what's interesting about that is that the components of the Mr. Sparkle achievement say, from stage one, make it to stage three bosses in survival mode within the Japanese ROM.
So that is spoiling of sorts, the fact that in this Simpsons arcade game that's going to come out in 360, you're going to be able to play the original, or US, I guess, ROM, but you also get to play the Japanese ROM.
Apparently, the Japanese ROM has lower difficulty, more health items, more points, and the ability to jump while holding a weapon.
Very interesting.
So that's going to be in that release.
And lastly, kind of some rumors going around.
This is big, big rumors.
But apparently, Retro Studios, which is one of the big Nintendo developers, right?
What did Retro Studios do?
Didn't they...
Donkey Kong
I'm going to work on another project that I am super excited about.
I can't talk about it too much, but if all goes well, it might just be one of my crowning achievements as an artist.
It's another Zelda game.
You think?
Yeah, because they've already, you know...
they you know put forth some effort into making stuff for Mario Kart and I think that they were you know they've been commented about saying no hey we'd love to get our hands on Zelda I think it's a Zelda like spin-off or something like that new like type of Zelda game well Zelda or not it could be very interesting to see what this is because this could be that big announcement at E3 like here is what the core gamer is gonna want a Wii U for yeah but see here's the thing though
Remember when they said the same thing about Metroid Other M?
How did that do?
It just, like, tanked.
I mean, so...
I don't know.
I don't know.
And fuck, if you can't sell a Metroid game on a Nintendo system, you got problems.
Alright, let's move on with some more rapid fire news.
Alan.
For those who remember the XCOM franchise from the 90s, a company named Firaxis showed up at E3 last year saying that they were going to bring back the franchise.
I completely missed the XCOM train when I was in junior high and high school.
If you ever want, I have the entire XCOM collection I bought on Steam for like four bucks, which has like five XCOM games.
They were pretty awesome.
Old ones were.
The really old ones were.
So we haven't seen much about the FPS version of the XCOM game, or rather under the XCOM license that Firaxis is bringing back.
And that's because it's being pushed to 2013, has been cancelled.
I guess maybe they're having problems imagining how XCOM would function as an FPS, but they're still developing it, they just need more time.
However, the XCOM strategy reboot, which I guess is more...
Here's more to what XCOM originally was.
It's still on board for a 2012 release.
They've also renamed the game to XCOM Forever.
Go figure.
Okay, this has it here as XCOM Enemy Unknown.
It's a joke.
It's like Duke Nukem Forever.
I'm trolling.
I'm tired.
That was like a low-flying jet over my head.
It was a bad joke.
What's that going over me?
Also, so next quick fire story is there's a game that was put on Kickstarter, which is like, I have a great idea and please fund my project.
I only need five grand and me and my friend will design this and blah, blah, blah.
A game called Oregon Trail, not Oregon the state, but Oregon like a kidney.
Oregon Trail Director's Cut, a success on Kickstarter.
Yeah.
So it's going to be a zombie-filled spoof of the Oregon Trail where I guess you've got a map and you're trying to survive getting from point A to point B. A destination where, of course, the big stronghold is that is keeping the zombies out.
And they met their Kickstarter goal.
So hopefully that will be developed and released and everyone will have a grand old time.
And this image here, it looks like they've got some pixelated Sean from Shaun of the Dead and some of the characters from Zombieland in sort of a...
Turn left, you moron.
And it looks like the files should work with the Garmin Mobile XT units.
I was thinking maybe it might be TomTom because they're the huge sort of standalone GPS.
Yeah, I thought for sure that TomTom would because they have a ton of voices like you get James Earl Jones and Samuel Jackson.
Yeah, this here has lists.
There's a Samuel Jackson.
Yes, there is a Samuel Jackson.
Left, motherfucker!
Can you do it?
Seriously, that is it.
There's Mr. T. There's got to be a Macho Man Savage one.
I don't know.
Go straight six miles.
Oh, yeah.
Let's see.
Destination on the left, boy.
No, I know they have like a Darth Vader one.
TomTom Voices.
Let's see here.
Wow.
You know, I kind of need a GPS.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Marge Simpson.
That's one of the newest ones that they're highlighting.
Yeah.
Now I kind of want a GPS.
That might be kind of fun.
Homer Simpson, Roger Moore, Kim Cattrall, Kit.
Kim Cattrall?
Kim Cattrall.
Why the fuck would you want Kim Cattrall doing your... Yoda.
It's just her howling from Porky's.
Even my mother would be like, the fuck is this?
Yoda, Han Solo, SpongeBob SquarePants, C-3PO, Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, Dory the Explorer, Darth Vader.
Where are some of the other funny ones here?
Who the fuck is that?
Uh...
Man, I don't even know.
Burt Reynolds.
I've heard the Burt Reynolds one.
Billy Connolly.
Dennis Hopper.
Alright, anyway.
Dennis Hopper's been dead how long?
If you have a Garmin Mobile XT, I guess any of them, there's a whole line of them.
Go under Reddit and look this up because it was posted to Reddit.
I guess it's Reddit people that...
There are a lot of dead people on there.
and some people that should be dead.
You're mean.
But anyways, CES, they showed off a few things, obviously a lot of TVs, including some new smart TVs or web-enabled TVs that have Gaikai and on-live support.
and Gaikai of course coming to some brand new LG TVs and you'll be able to stream games straight to the TV using the interface on there.
Also coming to Google TVs would be on live service and I'm guessing they'll allow you to
purchase the universal controller and stream stuff straight to the TV, which you have to use their player app for that.
No word on what other devices maybe the stuff will be coming to, but it's kind of neat that someday you'll be able to get TVs that stream games straight to them.
And I mean, if you think about it, you know,
Really, these consoles, if you will, will never go away because they just keep updating the hardware on their end and they can keep running all the new games.
You never have to buy a new console again.
Well, until the resolution gets really better.
It's very interesting.
This is a very interesting direction, having the consoles directly built into the TVs, essentially.
I mean, I realize these are kind of different, still kind of growing things, but how long before Microsoft puts out their own TV with a built-in Xbox and Kinect is right in the top of the TV on these two little cameras?
Well, even on top of that, I could see that in the next three years.
What if all the console manufacturers go streaming?
Then you don't need to buy the console.
You can play Twisted Metal, and then you can play Fable.
You can play Resistance and Dance Central.
I mean, it's all on one thing.
Could be very interesting.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There's no way to download entire games and all that.
It's still kind of a ways away before these huge epic games that fill a Blu-ray we really download right into our homes all the time.
You know what I mean?
So I think the next generation of games is still going to have a physical-based format, but two generations from now, this is what we could be looking at.
I think a lot of people thought we would be a download only at this point, but as far as Gaikai and OnLive are concerned, I guess we are.
Would this be a feature that would interest you in a TV at all, guys?
Or is this just, eh, whatever?
It's more, eh, whatever for me.
I mean, it's a neat technology for sure.
Alan?
We might be in the market for a new TV soon.
Is this something we should look to get?
Yeah.
Alright, well moving on, something that may be built in that you don't want so much, I don't know, we'll see.
But Mass Effect 3, of course, is coming out on PC as well as the various consoles.
But Mass Effect 3 on the PC, it will require Origin.
Origin.
It will not work on Steam As you know, EA and Valve are in a little bit of a quarrel right now Alan, you look like you're dying to comment on that situation Yeah, they're having a Wang contest Get out the ruler, boys What does it all boil down to?
Um, the fact that EA is not only are they a publisher and developer like Valve is, but they are also a medium of commerce distribution.
So now we have two storefronts like, I don't know, Target and Walmart or Macy's and Penny's that offer the same thing.
And then they're just having a cockfight over distribution.
Yeah.
Here's how EA puts it in their press release.
And I believe it's the whole fact that when you have a game on Steam, patches come through Steam.
And EA doesn't want that.
also this happened Dragon Age 2 which I mentioned during my gaming week that I'm playing I had to install Origins to get DA2 digitally it was on Steam for a couple months this was a big story like last year and it was on Steam and they took it down because Valve and Steam had a problem with how EA handled the DLC basically what it means is
if you buy a game on Steam Valve wants you to be able to buy DLC for it through the game itself like you load the game and then through the game interface you can buy DLC or buy the DLC a la carte via Steam with Dragon Age 2 you had to go to EA's website
So Valve wasn't doing the transaction.
Like you weren't actually doing the credit card transaction through Steam and they didn't like that.
So that's what got DA2 kicked off of Steam.
So now EA is basically saying we are making the game and we have a store so you have to buy it through our store.
Well now they are swearing up and down but even if you don't buy it in the Origin store you have to install Origin.
That's another big thing.
That's what Half-Life 2 did.
That's true.
But here you go.
Now they are saying, they're swearing Origin's not spyware.
Quote, Origin is not spyware and does not use or install spyware on users' machines.
In order to allow Origin to install games and their patches for everyone to use, Origin implements a permission change that results in Windows, not Origin, reviewing the file names in the program data slash Origin folder.
This is an ordinary Windows function, not an information gathering process.
So basically they're trying to say, we swear we're not spying on you, we just want to get our store on your computer.
Now to be fair, as Alan mentioned, this is what Valve did several years ago and it pissed people off then.
To activate your CD key and your license for Half-Life 2, the biggest sequel of the year at the time in 2004, you had to install this bullshitty Steam store?
What the fuck is this?
I just want to play Half-Life 2.
And of course the servers were overwhelmed at the time because it was unprecedented, but yeah.
Now, I hope I'm saying this name right in our chatroom, but it's Ahamkara, and our chatroom says, Steam is better, and I have more games there already, so they win.
End of story.
Origin can suck it.
And I think that's the way a lot of people kind of feel right now, is that it's like, I don't want another store.
This is very similar to what Loki was talking about probably an hour ago with the whole movie stuff, probably at the top of the show, with that whole fact that Warner Brothers wants to force people to use Ultraviolet, and I'm like, people don't want that.
They don't want...
One store focused on one company.
And the consumer is going to lose in this because there's going to be all these different stores.
It's like, I don't want all these fucking stores on my computer.
Here's the thing, though.
They think that people are either going to buy it at retail or wait 56 days to watch it.
They're not going to want to rent it.
Or they're going to stream it via their service.
Or they'll pirate it.
Or they'll pirate it.
They will pirate it.
That's what's going to happen.
I mean...
And for those wondering if they have Mass Effect 1 and 2 digital deluxe editions, which were available and are still available via Steam, if they can import your save games, because the plot is continuous through the third, because it's a trilogy, the whole story is going to wrap up with Mass Effect 3.
Yes, of course, if you have the previous two games, even through Steam, it will sniff your save game file and Mass Effect 3 will continue with the choices your character has made.
your version of Shepard so again and if you know if EA doesn't want Steam to sell it then it's it's not you know there it's not going to be on Steam if you really if this Origin thing pisses you off even if you go to Best Buy and buy a hard box copy of it at a store real store it's going to put Origin on your system there's no way to get around this unless you go to
A crack site.
But to be fair, exactly what Half-Life 2 did six or seven years ago.
But there were also cracked versions of Half-Life 2.
That's true.
And I think that's what's going to happen here.
All these companies think they know what gamers want.
Gamers want to be left the fuck alone.
That's what a lot of gamers want.
Anyhow.
Alright, we're going to take a moment to, you know, we say it's the show where every gamer has a voice, and one way we interact with you guys is through our email bag.
You guys send us emails every week.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And DarkSakura will usually dive in the mailbag and read your emails, but she's not here.
I thought I read these beforehand.
um now what the hell we only have two emails tonight right what the hell so the backstory about this before I jump into the email and if you have a problem with this just don't be an ass in chat because Jamie would probably kick you and I would kick you too in her place so that's how I'm going to step up and be DarkSakura tonight um the Girl Scouts allow transgender girls into their into a certain chapter um
If the parents present them as a girl and, you know, they go by a girl name, they can be in the Girl Scouts even though they were born biologically something else.
There's a huge, there's a right wing, you know, people within the Girl Scouts that have a huge problem with this.
And they're asking that people not buy Girl Scout cookies until these children are thrown out.
Just so you know, Alan, I think our listeners are pretty smart.
Nobody's going to have a problem.
I know, but it's just... We all think that bitch is crazy.
Yeah.
So now people who are supportive of the transgender kids or girls being in the Girl Scouts are hearing about this boycott and they're like, I fucking want to buy cookies because this sounds awesome.
It's access to different types of people.
So here's the email after all that backstory.
Dear Personi, after reading DarkSakura's Tumblr post about the Girl Scout cookie boycott, I did what I usually do in response to these kinds of right-wing protests.
I sought out a way to do the exact opposite of what those I completely disagree with tell me not to do.
Being antisocial and not having nieces who are currently Girl Scouts, I searched to see if I could buy Girl Scout cookies online.
However, I was not able to find any.
In fact, according to the link at the end of this email, Girl Scouts of America does not allow their cookies to be sold online.
My question is why?
There are a great number of shut-ins that are yearning for the kind of awesome Samoan goodness that they cannot possibly get on any Samoan porn site.
These people have loads of excess income that can be easily spent on fundraisers that fund the instilling freedom and independence into the mind of young girls across this great land.
Without programs such as the ones done by the Girl Scouts of America, more women may become shut-ins like the men that could potentially fund the GSA.
I urge everyone to urge the Girl Scouts of America to allow the sale of Girl Scout cookies online.
I don't know how to do that for I Am Too Busy playing Skyrim.
Stay black, Redertainment.
Um, here's the thing.
I think the reason why they don't want you to buy them online is keep in mind that, you know, the whole stuff they're trying to teach in the Girl Scouts, I think is part of the whole like going out and, you know, they want the girls to be able to, you know, get out in the community and sell them.
And I think, you know, even though you make the case, I don't want to leave my house.
The problem is they want the Girl Scouts to leave the house to do this.
It's to teach the Scouts customer service and how to count money and how to run a budget and blah, blah, blah.
Exactly.
So for that, I mean, you don't have the girls in a factory doing all this.
I mean, maybe, I don't know.
But, you know, they're not going to learn as much from that.
I think it's about being out there in the community, being visible.
That's why they're out in the grocery stores and things like that.
Because, you know, Red Entertainment, at some point, you're going to have to get out of the house and go get groceries.
I mean, well, then again...
and they're usually parked out at Safeway.
If they open up online ordering... Oh, goddamn case.
Oh, God.
Because they only make a certain amount a year because, you know, they give the boxes to whatever the chapters are in each state.
They go out to the little suburbs.
They would have to make a shitload more cookies and they would have to do fulfillment and how to ship it and pricing and blah, blah, blah.
So it's really just about the scouts going out into the community and selling cookies.
And I don't think that's going to change.
Mm-hmm.
It'd be nice, but if they sold them online, there'd be no point in setting up the little tables and irritating you.
So, I mean, but to be... Irritating you.
I always buy the Girl Scout cookies because, like, you know, when I... You know, for me, usually, it's kind of like, you know, I'll be walking in stores and the Girl Scouts are here and like, would you like to buy Girl Scout cookies?
I'm like, fucking yeah.
Yeah, I'll have... Fuck yeah, I want Girl Scout cookies.
Thank you for being here.
Oh, my God.
I miss Samoas so much or whatever they're called now.
So... Thin Mints all the way.
And the peanut butter ones.
Get out.
All right.
That email had nothing to do with video games.
Well, I guess sometimes people eat Girl Scout cookies while playing video games, so there you go.
Yeah.
All right.
Hi, folks.
Sorry, I've got to read this comment from our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
SSJ100Matt says, so it will be like EverQuest and we can type slash Girl Scout cookies.
Can you still do that in EverQuest?
EverQuest 2 went free.
They had the Pizza Hut or the Roundtable plug-in, right?
Yeah, slash pizza.
Oh god, that was like a running gag on OLR for a year.
It was the whole slash pizza thing.
I wonder if they still do that.
Because, you know, EverQuest went free to play and all that.
Yeah.
It's awesome.
Hi folks, I listened to last night's show today, enjoyed it as always.
I have to chip in on this open discussion.
I think this blackout day has to happen.
Most people who are not plugged into the geek community have no concept of what it is or what it means.
What's worse is because the media wants it in the news networks are not bringing it to the forefront.
I wouldn't wait until the 23rd, but do it on the 20th to allow for the desired backlash against the bill to build.
This would also be too big of a story for the major news outlets to ignore.
What gets me the most is the congressman pushing it.
It is extremely dismissive of the critics, including internet and security experts, including Vincent Cerf.
It seems he doesn't care because the big media filling his coffers wants it, and the heck with representing his constituents or observing the Constitution.
Think about that next time you're at the ballot box.
All very good points.
Obviously there's been a lot of changes with SOPA just like over the weekend and it's coming up on our show a little later so if you haven't already heard I'll kind of clarify some of the developments with SOPA.
Long story short, it sounds like we're being heard and that's a great thing.
All the way at the top we're being heard.
President Obama put out a statement about it, right?
Yes, which we'll cover a little later.
Wink wink.
He's been known to say one thing and then all of a sudden, ha!
yeah so but I mean yeah so it's it's kind of one of those we've won the battle but not won the war type of thing because you know then the MPAA put out this whole thing about you know well it's all these thieves are just trying to win and da da da da da and it's kind of like take a chill pill the movie industry has been suffering not because of piracy but because the movies have been bad and that was take care signed Wendy that was from Wendy
or the fact that, you know what, when it costs $51 for three people to go see a movie that they could have rented at Blockbuster for $250, you know, it's like, there's the problem, Hollywood.
Get your head out of your butt.
Anyhow, we'll talk a little more about the SOPA updates a little later.
Those were our two emails.
Mailbag is over.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Send us your emails on whatever is going on in the gaming world this week.
Meanwhile, some more gaming news.
We are going to get to your calls in just a little bit and your Twitter topics.
So get those Twitter topics locked in at twitter.com slash OLR.
You got about five more minutes to get those in.
And we will be taking your calls in a little bit at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.
If you don't already have us on there, you should add us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
That's all one word if you want to give us a call a little later on.
We still have a few more stories.
Don't call just yet.
Actually, before we get to the stories, it's very important that we have our moment to rant.
It's a little segment we do here called the FUs of the week.
Why?
Because we can.
Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
Fuck you, the locksmith that fixed my car.
Because not only did you arrive two hours late, but you also drilled a hole into my ignition, which looks weird, and also left a bunch of metal shavings all over the floor of my car.
Didn't bother to fix that.
Thanks!
I'll definitely pass out your cards.
Alan, do you have any FUs of the week?
I'm a very finicky and light sleeper, so it doesn't matter how amazing and comfortable a sleeping arrangement is, if I've never slept there before, it's going to take me an hour or two to fall asleep, and I'm running on about two hours of sleep right now.
Aw, it doesn't help that I'm always elbowing you in the back here.
Yeah.
So, I'm so tired.
I've always loved, you know, pitching in to help co-host OLR, but I feel like I'm slurring my words.
That's how tired I am.
So... You're waking up every hour with a baby.
He has me.
I'm trying to read.
Alan, you're snoring.
Shut up.
I'm like, yeah, snoring, because I only snore when I'm exhausted.
So...
Yeah, I'm like trying to read emails.
Words.
I'm gonna fall asleep.
So yeah, F you to being tired and also just being a finicky, prissive sleeper.
Fair enough.
I don't really have a lot to be mad about.
I have a three-day weekend this weekend.
That's awesome.
Like, how can I be in a bad mood?
I don't have to go to work tomorrow.
I have the day off to do whatever I want.
F you to the fact that Alan is so tired that we won't be able to go anywhere in the morning.
But otherwise, I'm really pretty happy with a lot of things right now.
I was kind of tired earlier today, though, so F you to being really tired.
F you to the fact that I can't stay up as late anymore, it seems like.
Like, I used to be able to easy stay up for Rocky Horror and be up until 3.34 in the morning, but now I get fucking tired at like 12.31.
Is it because I'm old?
I think that's it.
Fuck!
And Disneyland is having a 24-hour day for Leap Day, February 29th, and it's like...
Ooh, we're working a ride Space Mountain at 4 in the morning.
It's gonna be fucking awesome.
And I'm like, how the hell am I gonna stay up until 4?
Jesus Christ.
Monster.
I never drink that kind of shit, but I'll do it for Disney.
24 hours of Disney.
And my clubbing days are over.
I don't do disco naps anymore.
When we started this show, we were ranting about getting into our mid-20s.
Now it's our mid-30s.
Wah.
All right, let's move on with some gaming news, Loki.
All right.
Let's talk a little bit about a witch hunt that was going on.
It's actually kind of funny because it was regarding Witcher 2 and people pirating the game.
I remember back a few months ago or so when CD Projekt said...
That they're going to be targeting pirates and they're going to be filing legal action against them.
And, you know, eventually they penned an open letter to the gaming community where they, you know, said they're going to stop doing that.
And, you know, apparently, though, they're still saying, you know, piracy hurts them.
But...
I don't know.
I don't know why they stopped.
I'm guessing that they had less good luck than they'd hoped finding the people that stole the stuff from them.
I would say it's either bad PR or realized it was going to cost them too much money.
Probably just one of those when they really thought about what they were doing, they realized it wasn't cost-effective.
or something.
I guess.
I'm kind of surprised they don't pursue one or two to make an example, but I don't know.
Maybe, or maybe, maybe, just crazy thought here, maybe it has something to do with they watched the whole internet backlash for GoDaddy.
I think a lot of people watched what happened with that whole thing where GoDaddy really got pressured by their customer to change their stance on SOPA and, you know,
obviously they were wrong on SOPA and they should have turned around but I mean it was really money talks in that case and I bet a lot of tech companies are looking at that going dude don't piss off the internet I mean after all it's they're they're the ones giving us money
here's the actual reason why they stopped basically it says our fans have always remained our greatest concern and we pride ourselves on the fact that you all know that we listen to you and take your opinions to heart while we are confident that no one who legally owns one of our games has been required to compensate us for copyright infringement we value our fans, our supporters and our community too highly to take the chance that we might even falsely accuse even one individual
So apparently there's a foolproof way of... A change of heart.
Well, you know, and in a way, what if the whole thing went to trial and so forth, and then it doesn't go their way?
I mean, maybe they're really afraid of that.
So, I mean, that could be part of it, too.
So, yeah.
All right, anyhow.
Moving on to...
Video Games Saving Lives Words with Friends
is a very popular iOS... It's fucking Scrabble.
Like, I know they're not allowed to say it's Scrabble.
It's Scrabble.
But it's fucking Scrabble.
Okay, Words with Friends is fucking Scrabble on the iPhone.
Words with Friends is like Bowl Cart.
And Scrabble is like Mario Kart.
Although they actually remembered to change Moo Moo Farm on the banner.
Like they would change the board in Words with Friends.
But anyway...
One of the deal about Words With Friends is that you could actually chat.
You could chat with people that you're playing with.
And I actually have friends that will play.
I don't like Words With Friends, personally.
You know why I don't like Words With Friends?
Because it's too easy to cheat.
It is way too easy because it's not a live game.
And I've been tempted to do this.
Go on Google and find an anagram finder.
Go on anagram.net or whatever it is.
It's even easier than that.
Yeah, seriously.
They have apps where you take a screen print of your words with friends and then you run it through the app and it tells you here's the best play.
I mean, it's like...
Now, I could play with people that I know wouldn't cheat, but like, I just, if I have the alerts on, my fucking phone goes off at 2.30 in the morning with some of my, you know, some of my friends stay up late or they're on different coasts or whatever.
So one of my friends on the East Coast will just be getting up for the day at 6 a.m.
and makes their play in words with friends and here I am fast asleep at 3 a.m.
Do-do-do-do-do.
and DarkSakura.com.
Well, anyway, I've been dragging this out, but long story short, there was a random match played in Word with Friends with these two folks.
One of them was an Australian, and one of them was here in Missouri, and they just got randomly matched up, but they were chatting with each other and I guess having a very nice conversation, which...
is almost newsworthy in itself ASL everybody I chat with on the internet that's usually a stranger is usually a dumbass like no offense you guys I'm talking about the strangers like if I play random online games with strangers like Uno or something like I get the biggest dumb fucks on the internet you know
So it's a miracle in one that civil people got together to play this game.
And then apparently this guy in Australia, Simon Fletcher, was playing Words with Friends and he started complaining in the chat, I've been having chest pains and whatever.
I don't know, how does that even fucking come up in chat?
You just played the word heartburn for 45 points.
Sorry, I'm replying so low.
I'm typing with one hand because my arm is having shooting.
I can't use my right arm right now because I'm having shooting pain.
How does that even come up in a random chat?
I don't know.
Whatever.
But they've been talking about it.
And Beth Legler was the opponent.
And they were playing against Beth.
I guess Simon and his wife were playing against Beth.
and Beth, luckily, was married to a doctor.
So kind of told her husband about, oh, well, I've been playing with this guy in Australia, but he's telling me da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
And the guy, the doctor said, you know what?
Simon needs to go to a hospital immediately.
And sure enough, when he finally went to the hospital, he had a 99% blockage near his heart.
So it was right to tell the guy to go to a hospital.
Now, I get with this whole video game saving lives thing or whatever.
I think that part of it's obviously getting blown out of proportion, just like Loki was rolling his eyes at the beginning of the story.
This was more about guys being fucking stubborn when it comes to going to the doctor.
Let's be real.
A lot of you probably are guys.
Those few ladies that are out there listening, I know there's a few of you.
How many of you know guys that are too stubborn to go to the doctor because they don't want to admit something's wrong with them or they don't want to admit they're getting old or whatever it is?
I think this is more a fact that, honey, a doctor is telling me you need to go to the hospital.
You're going to go to the fucking hospital.
I know someone whose dad had a minor incident and it turned out to be serious, but he also hadn't set foot in a doctor's office in almost 30 years.
That's crazy.
And his attitude was, you don't see doctors because nothing exists until they find it, and that's when you're sick.
So if you don't go to the doctor, they won't find you.
I realize some people avoid the doctor due to, well, not having insurance.
That's a whole other Oprah I'm not going to get into.
Or they avoid the doctor maybe because of religious reasons, I guess.
But for real, if neither of those apply to you and you're just being fucking stubborn, like, go.
Don't you want to be healthy?
All right.
Anyhow.
So, yay words with friends bringing people together.
This could have been about a 1997 AOL chat room.
You know what I mean?
Whatever.
All right, moving on, Alan.
So, CES just happened, and usually that's a big electronics and hardware gadgetry event.
Not so much for the gaming, that's mostly saved of course for Tokyo Game Show and E3 and all that.
However, the biggest gaming related thing that came out of CES most likely is the Project Fiona gaming touchscreen tablet by a company called Razer, the E-R-A-Z-E-R.
and I must admit looking at the pictures of this thing it looks like a very sexy device it looks well made it's sleek and it's going to run an Intel Ivy Bridge Core i7 processor it's going to have three axis tilt gyro functionality a magnetometer accelerometer force feedback it's going to vibrate Dolby 7 surround sound with built in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and Razer CEO Minliang Tan explains, we are looking to change the whole perception of tablets.
This first of its kind PC gaming tablet with integrated dual controllers is definitely not for playing casual games about unhappy birds or zombie killing flora.
Ooh, throw in shade.
Throw in shade at the iPhone games.
Imagine a black iPad.
and DarkSakura.
and so on.
It'll be $999.99.
And this thing looks awesome, and it's like, alright, it's PC gaming on a tablet, and it's touchscreen, it's got all this cool shit, but where's the market?
Because if you have that kind of money to drop on something like this, you can get a very competent gaming laptop that is a fucking laptop, and you can do laptop shit on it.
That laptop you're using right now, I bought for $400.
Well over two years ago, because I was with my ex at the time, and so it was probably about three years old, and that cost me $400.
That will run Warcraft Cataclysm on it.
Yeah, not low settings, but you can play on it, yeah.
Yeah, so, I mean, imagine what $1,000 now would get you, you know?
So the display on it is 10.1 inches diagonal viewable.
Resolution is 1280 by 800.
I'm going to post a link of this into chat.
It looks like an awesome device.
It's great that they're trying to make this, but where's the market?
Who is this for?
I have to agree with this point that Cinderwolf said in our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com.
Cinderwolf says, did he just say 7.1 surround sound on a tablet?
Yeah.
Thank you for watching!
Unless you've got, you're like on Amtrak and you've got these backpacks like, oh, these are my speakers, yo, and you're setting them up.
I don't know.
Or you have like Uber headphones that can emulate it really fucking well, you know?
It might be a bit much.
Yeah, so the Dolby 7-1 chip and firmware is in there at least.
But yeah, exactly.
If you've got the speakers, then you're probably in your house.
You can play on your desktop.
it looks like a hot little device maybe mom is always on the desktop playing words with friends with people in Australia so maybe that's why I need a tablet it also sounds like because this tablet is so streamlined that it's going to be able to churn out max settings graphics on this little tablet that a PC where you always have to upgrade your graphics card every two years and it sounds like this is just a total monster visually on how it's going to render games but who's going to buy it?
Loki, is this something that interests you?
Fuck no.
Why not?
It's too damn expensive.
Now, I was trying to find out.
They have...
This seriously makes me think, like, I'm surprised Loki doesn't try to build his own version of this for half as much.
No, no.
Don't get me wrong.
What's in it is pretty powerful.
It's got a Core i7 inside of it and a bunch of other, you know, fancy shit.
And the form factor's nice, but it looks ridiculous.
I mean, it's not portable at all.
It's as portable as a laptop is.
And honestly, just buy a fucking laptop and a controller.
I mean...
It's pretty much it.
And the price point is just ridiculous.
I was trying to find, remember they had, this is the company that wanted to do that, Switchblade, which was the portable MMO system that was going to revolutionize everything.
And then that kind of flopped, and then they came out with this really fucking expensive keyboard, which I cannot find for the life of me, but I swear that keyboard's like 300 bucks.
all I have to say though is that you know we're near probably within a month of the next iPad announcement right that should come late January February if by some I mean we all know the next iPad has to fucking be high def has to right and the rumors are swelling and all that stuff it's gonna be more powerful
If Apple finally decides, maybe now is the time To finally put some type of attachment on the iPad That gives tangible game controls This thing should not even bother coming out It's fucking dead already Like, not to sound all Apple fanboy, but let's be real
and with the tablet and the two you know move like Sony move like gaming sticks I am interested in how those gaming sticks with the thumb you know thing translates mouse controls but what if you want to play a first-person shooter you need the WASD and the keyboard and stuff so even then even now this tablet looks like it's gonna limit the experience of the PC games that a laptop or PC would give you so
It's also like $1,000.
Yeah.
I mean, you can spend $1,000 on a laptop and get a nice laptop.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, let's move on with a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Loki.
And also, by the time it actually does come out, there's going to be something better and cheaper.
I mean, fuck.
Switch Play never came out.
That was shown on E3, I think, last year, or CES or some shit.
Okay, sorry.
Anyway, so let's talk a little bit about successful franchises.
And one successful franchise, which I'm just surprised every day in how successful it is, Just Dance.
And Just Dance 3 sold 7 million copies already worldwide, and that's from October.
And of course, the series itself has moved 25 million units.
I would definitely say that the music franchise is not dead, or at least Just Dance isn't dead.
So, Konami, DDR, when have you moved 25 million units ever?
Or 7 million units ever?
How does Just Dance 3 compare to Dance Central 2?
It's a different type of game.
Dance Central 2 is more of learning the actual dance steps.
Whereas Just Dance, the whole Just Dance series is more of mimicking what's on screen.
You remember when you watched me play that ABBA game?
Oh, yeah.
Where you're holding the thing.
Imagine that to Katy Perry songs.
That's Just Dance.
What I meant was the units sold.
The sales.
Oh, yeah.
They're far and beyond Dance Central 2.
Well, yeah, because Dance Central 2 is Kinect, and everyone, of course, has a fucking Wii, so that makes sense.
But I want to say that I would be willing to bet that Just Dance 3 on the Kinect is probably outsold Dance Central 2.
Which, I don't know, I haven't played Just Dance 3 specifically, but Dance Central 2 is so good, like, it's kind of sad.
I'll have to look up the numbers, but yeah, I'd be willing to bet that they've probably beat them out.
All right, while you look that up, don't interrupt me.
Wait till I'm done with the story.
But I want to close out today before we get to the Skype line with some more of those updates on SOPA.
Obviously, the Stop Online Piracy Act.
There has been, and since that email was sent in and since last week's show, there has been quite a bit of change going on with this.
And for one, the SOPA sponsor, Lamar Smith, came out and said he's going to pull the DNS blocking provisions from the bill.
Quote,
After consultation with industry groups across the country, I feel we should remove domain name system blocking from the Stop Online Piracy Act so that the committee can further examine the issues surrounding this provision.
So, you know, that was obviously one of the big controversial things was the whole blocking of websites.
That getting taken out of the bill.
Now, also over the weekend, the Obama administration, as pretty much has already been brought up earlier in the show, but I had it listed here, so whatever.
The Obama administration basically came out against the bills in their current form.
saying, in a nutshell, I'm going to really try my best to summarize this, they support that foreign websites and piracy and all this needs to be stopped, but not at the cost of censoring lawful activity and must not, as they say in the release, inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small.
So in other words, they don't want to see
sites get shut down by corporations because of flaw wording in this bill, which is kind of where I think a lot of us are at.
I can see that they need to do something about foreign websites.
They need to do something about fucking spam.
You know what I mean?
That shit is annoying, but how do you stop it?
I don't know if there's an easy answer.
I really don't think there's an easy answer to stopping that kind of stuff.
Good filters on your email?
Maybe.
That's just kind of where I'm at.
You can kind of spoof a lot of that now, but maybe they need to change the system that uses encryption verification.
I guess any of that could get hacked by people, but there's got to be something where there's more accountability from the original center and it's easier to track.
You know what I mean?
Okay, so Just Dance and Dance Central 2 Now Dance Central 2 has been out a lot less Well, a few weeks less It's only been out 11 weeks Whereas Just Dance 3 has been out for 14 weeks Just Dance 3 is at 993,191 units That's only in the US And Dance Central 2 is at 930,858 units
So they're slightly ahead, but they've been out for three more weeks Interesting, okay, well that's good to know Although, for it to be noted, this chart, which was from last week Dance Runs Rule 2 is in the 17th spot, whereas Just Dance 3 is in the 20th spot Well, that's good
Well, I mean, I'm not hating on Just Dance 3.
I mean, it's a decent game.
That's straight on the 360.
That's not all platforms.
Okay.
All right, let's open up the Skype line.
It's that time.
We're going to open up the Skype line now and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
While we wait for those calls to come in because there is a little bit of a delay, we have just a couple tweets tonight.
Not a lot, but we do have a couple.
So let me get to some of those tweets right now.
I just want to make sure there wasn't anything earlier in the week that I missed here.
I guess not anything I'm catching off the top of my head.
I apologize.
I'm going to be honest.
If you tweet us on Sunday, you have a much better chance of getting read than tweeting us on Monday after the show.
Because sometimes I lose those amongst... We get a lot of spam tweets, too.
I have to filter through.
Anyway, we'll start with a tweet from Spazinator on Twitter.
Tweets us and says, Will there be another marathon or fuck show anytime soon?
Fuck show, no.
That was a one-time thing.
That's done.
A marathon show, yes.
We've been talking about it.
We just don't know when.
Tonight would have been a great night for that, but just too much other stuff going on.
So it may not be until there's another long weekend, which for me isn't until... I don't have a long weekend.
Which for me isn't until Memorial Day.
Do you get President's Day off?
Nope.
Interesting.
See, I don't get President's Day off, but I do get Martin Luther King Day off.
We don't get any of those.
Interesting.
But you get Memorial Day, right?
Yes.
Oh, but we have other plans for Memorial Day weekend, most likely.
So...
Sometime.
It is in our minds.
Let me put it that way.
It's just, you know, again, that whole thing I talked about earlier about only being able to stay up so late.
But I think it would be fun to do another like noon to midnight show if nothing else.
So we'll see.
It's on our minds, but just not in the next month or two.
Alright, let's see, moving on to some other tweets.
TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets.
I'll start with this one about the Writers Guild.
Announces a list of nominees for Best Writing in Video Games.
You know, the WGA, they also nominate movies and things like that, but now they get into writing for video games.
After all, a lot of video games are very movie-sized scripts these days, right?
So, these games got nominated for Best Video Game Writing by the WGA.
Assassin's Creed Revelations
Batman Arkham City, Brink, Mortal Kombat.
It's strange, but I guess it did have a story mode.
And Uncharted 3, Drake's Deception.
Those are the nominees from the WGA.
List needs more Portal 2, in my opinion.
That's kind of an obviously missing game.
But yeah, I mean, still a lot of those games are very good and have very, you know, stories that suck you in.
So there you go.
Again, our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
If you'd like to go ahead and give us a call, you can at any time.
All right.
One other story from Tiger Claw.
Whistleblower alleges unlawful practices at Codemasters.
He links us to this story on Shaq News.
A former Codemasters employee has publicly accused the publisher of unlawful business practices.
A programmer, Semisesi, I hope I said that right, was a programmer on the game Body Count, says that Codemasters has threatened former staff with bankruptcy proceedings over a dispute regarding wages the company claims were mistakenly paid out.
He wrote this whole blog post about it saying that Codemasters frequently infringed on employees' rights.
They failed to give workers 11 hours of rest in any 24-hour work period.
So in other words, yet another slave driving game company story.
Unfortunately, we hear way too many of these on the show, which is really sad.
But anyway, we got a call coming in on the Skype line, so let's go to it.
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is VidPower.
Hey, VidPower.
I haven't heard from you in a very long time.
How are you doing?
Good, good.
What's up with you guys?
You know, same old shit, different week, 10 years later.
Right, right.
Exactly.
So yeah, I wanted to call in and talk about CES.
CES.
Oh, that's right.
You're in Vegas, right?
You still there?
Indeed.
Exactly.
So in your backyard, did you go to the party?
Yes, I did.
I did go to CES and I checked out the video games there and I kind of wanted to tell you guys what stuff was good there.
Please do.
Our man on the street.
Please.
How was CES?
What did you see?
It was pretty good.
It's pretty good.
You know what?
The one game that...
Really kind of came out to me and I wasn't expecting to like was, believe it or not, it was Microsoft Flight.
Oh, okay.
The upcoming flight simulator.
Yeah, that's like their replacement for Microsoft Flight Simulator, right?
It's kind of their new version of that for a new generation.
Exactly, exactly.
You know, I've only played like a flight simulator like once or twice in my life and I was like really awful.
So, you know, this game wasn't really on my radar, but after playing it and...
It was really fun, I gotta admit.
Was it easy to pick up?
Because I know the problem with a lot of flight simulators is that I don't know how to fly a fucking plane.
It is a flight simulator, and if you don't know the proper sequence to turn the plane on to get it to take off, you're not going anywhere in that game.
Or does Microsoft Flight kind of simplify that?
Yeah, yeah.
So what they did was they had a setup on a PC, but they had an Xbox 360 controller connected to the PC.
And one of the developers was there.
And basically, he had these bunch of challenges.
And it really, using just the Xbox 360 controller, it was really simplified controls.
And it makes flying a plane way easier.
Hmm.
Much easier than I thought it would be.
Interesting.
But yeah, it was really fun.
They had really basic stuff like how to take off and how to land.
And they had some fun stuff like how to collect all these little fly-through rings and stuff.
Things like that.
Wasn't that one of the stages in Pilotwings?
No, no.
But very good-looking graphics, I assume.
I remember flight simulators were always really good demonstrators of graphical capabilities.
That was also one of the stages in Superman 64.
Oh, shut up.
Awesome.
How big of a presence does video gaming have at CES?
Because we're usually told that it's not there as much as you'd think.
Well, yeah, that's an accurate statement.
It's definitely not big.
In terms of video game related stuff, obviously at the Microsoft booth.
and at the Sony booth as well.
Those are pretty obvious.
But other than that, like you couldn't really find anything else that were video game related.
So those are like really the only two booths that you could go to to play actual video games.
Gotcha.
Was there anything just, you know, since we're all nerds here at OLR, was there anything that kind of jumped out at you?
Like, wow, this is something I really want in my living room.
Like even if it's not necessarily gaming related, was there any device that just made you go like, dang, I want one of these next Christmas?
Tell you the truth, not really.
It was just a lot of random cool stuff that was probably not ready for a consumer level until a few years down the line.
It's all too damn expensive.
How does one of those 100-foot HDTVs look in person?
It is pretty sweet, gotta admit.
Seeing that in person was pretty eye-opening there.
Awesome, awesome.
Now, does the Porn Expo still go on next door at the same time, or did that change now?
You know what, that one, the original Porn Expo, now it's on the week after CES.
However, this completely separate company is doing another adult
and convention things.
They're in the same time.
So, you know, tapping into that market.
Back-to-back adult cons in Las Vegas.
I guess it can sustain.
We'll see.
Good time.
One of these days I got to make it to CES.
That's got to be on my bucket list of things to do at some point.
Do you have to be industry to get into CES?
No, I don't think so.
I thought you did.
Really?
Technically you do, but it's pretty easy.
Like the old E3, it's really easy?
Yeah, it's pretty easy.
Very cool, very cool.
Well, VidPower, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
No, just kind of giving you guys a quick gaming summary over at CES.
I played some of the other house party games.
Yeah?
I Am Alive is good stuff.
I really enjoyed that.
It's really fun.
It reminds me of Prince of Persia.
and uh the the combat quote-unquote combat is uh remember playing uh Metal Gear Solid games and you know you can hold up people by pointing a gun at them the entire combat is kind of centered around like intimidating your opponents by pointing a gun at them so that's like really original and I had a lot of fun with that interesting did you play the new Alan Wake at all
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I guess it was kind of one of those games that sold gradually, from what I understand.
It never really was the chart topper, but it lasted for a long time.
Yeah.
Definitely, definitely.
All right, well, VidPower, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls, hopefully, but thank you so much for the call, and maybe see you at CES 2013.
Cool, cool.
Later.
Take care, buddy.
All right, Las Vegas.
We have quite a few listeners in Las Vegas.
That's a town I need to get back to and visit.
It probably doesn't even look the same.
You know the last time I was in Vegas was 2001, a long time ago.
I went a few years ago.
There was no tram the last time I was in Vegas.
And apparently they have like a whole tram thing that goes to all the big casinos now on the strip.
Yeah, I don't think I was there when they had a tram.
Last time I was there, we went and visited Zappos.
That's an awesome company.
And the Sahara... Oh, yeah.
I know Zappos.
Yeah, that's the... Their call center has a really big reputation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's fucking amazing.
Yeah, I was a call center trainer for many, many years.
That's a company I would love to get into.
It was just like...
I really wish it worked.
Yeah, it's a company a lot of folks modeled themselves after.
They have a DVR machine in their building, by the way.
Do they really?
I played on it.
Interesting.
What mix?
It was... I think it was a max two, if I remember correctly.
Not bad.
Yeah.
You can stay fit on lunch breaks.
Yep.
Very cool.
1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
We're out of tweet topics.
They also have napping pods.
Really?
They do.
That's amazing.
All their conference rooms are themed and each of their little rows and departments or wherever, they have themed... It's fucking amazing.
It's seriously...
Star Trek Experience Warp Core Breach
that was the year 2000 that was October 2000 because I did two trips to Vegas like almost back to back and then I haven't been back in like 10 years but uh that was the first time I was ever drunk I was like 22 or 23 so you know but I was at the I know I totally missed the 21 years old thing go figure but uh yeah that was at the Star Trek experience and um
It wasn't the first time I'd ever had alcohol.
It was the first time I got drunk.
And like a true nerd, it was at the Star Trek experience.
The Borg thing wasn't even there.
I never got to ride it.
And now it's all closed, which is sad.
Oh, did one of the kitties finally come out?
Yeah, to eat.
To eat.
He's like, all right, I'll put up with Loki being here.
Maruko's here.
All right.
Let's try to take another call here.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Cinderwolf.
Hey, what's up, Cinderwolf?
What's on your mind, buddy?
Not too much.
I actually just figured I finally have time to actually catch the broadcast tonight.
Thought I'd call in and say hi to everybody.
Well, hello, hello.
Aren't you from Canada, if I remember right?
I am.
Yeah, you've got it.
Well, you don't have a three-day weekend then because Martin Luther King is a very American holiday.
So you just happen to have a late Sunday available, huh?
Yeah, pretty much.
I usually get about a half a day, really.
Three quarters of a day a week between both jobs.
Alright, alright.
Wow, wow, alright.
So crazy, crazy.
Well, since you got a chance to call in, what do you want to talk about tonight?
Any story or maybe something we missed?
Well, actually, I'm going to be very honest.
I did actually miss quite a bit of the broadcast, so I'll actually have to go back and catch up on it tomorrow.
But I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about a game that I've been playing recently called Bastion, actually.
Oh, yes, of course, Bastion.
The Canadian launches the game.
Yes, of course.
Pretty much, yeah.
Actually, I just double-checked my Skyrim count.
I've been playing Skyrim for about 180 hours over the past month and a half now.
and uh actually the video card died so I'm borrowing a replacement from a buddy of mine can't run Skyrim but I can play Bastion of all things so well Bastion is you know not quite the cutting edge 3D graphics but sometimes it is not all about the graphics right no I mean it's not not at all in fact I find this sort of gaming revolution even though it's uh most of everything seems to be
3D and impressive graphics.
I find there's still this growing movement to go old school or traditional sort of 2D with cell shading or that sort of thing.
2D side scrollers even.
So what possessed you to decide to jump in and check out Bastion?
I actually picked up the demo online through the 360 back before the console update with the dashboard.
And it was sort of an update right in my face.
I was like, you know, I love the artwork.
I'm actually a major fan of artwork working actually at a comic shop as well.
and it really stood out to me.
I found the artwork is actually very fantastic, very amazing.
It's almost like somebody's sketching the world and it just sort of comes to life and that stood out to me at the time.
So I'm playing this and I'm like, wow, the controls are very simplistic.
It's an incredibly basic story.
You don't even need to know anything about the game to start getting into it.
And even two hours into the game, you're still like, okay, I still don't know the entire backstory so it's sort of driving you to
Really keep playing to find out how it's going to end and exactly what the calamity is.
Now, a lot of folks have kind of talked about the narration in the game and how important that the whole narration and narrating it as it's unfolding.
Do you think the narration is something really unique to the game or are you kind of like, ah, this is gimmicky?
Actually, I actually love the narration.
Once in a while it's kind of cheesy, but
Actually, it really makes it feel almost kind of like, you know, like story time when you're a kid, so to speak.
But it's not enough that it's, or it's not so much that you're like, okay, this is really something that annoys me.
It's a, hey, actually, I never really thought of it that way.
Sort of deal when it hits when it hits a new point.
And you're just like, well, you know, I kind of like the backstory dialogue when you're, you know, you smoke the little pipe, you go to this little area to essentially just grind and grind and grind, pick up your little crystal shards or fragments.
And in between each wave, there's a little piece of the kid's backstory in the background.
So it's like, hey, that's kind of neat, bringing me up to speed on who I'm actually playing with.
and I thought it was kind of interesting that like as you kind of put that center area together it can kind of change the way the narration is going to because each building that you build kind of changes you know you get a little different narration for that so yeah actually I found the narration did change a little bit between buildings but by the end of it you know you're like I'm I still have to be only about halfway through it but
I find the narration really ends up the same because you end up building the same buildings by the end of it anyway.
Sure, sure.
So in a way, there's a little bit of a sort of a multi-path, but it's still a very linear storyline, which there's nothing wrong with linear.
But the way they've gone about the story kind of makes you think, well, you know, maybe if I play it a little bit differently later on, even though I know the ending, is it going to be more of a challenge or am I going to discover things I didn't know were there before?
I thought the game was really well developed in dragging and sucking you into it to see it through to the end.
Alright, well it sounds like you are definitely enjoying Bastion, so are you hoping there's going to be a sequel?
As if I need to ask?
Definitely.
I can hope.
I mean, there have been the rumors of Buzz online saying there is, saying there aren't, and you know, we just all have to sort of cross our fingers, but
I figure once I finish this, I'll probably round Skyrim count up to 200 hours or so.
Alright, nice.
Alright, well, Cinderwolf, thanks so much for the call and reminding us that Bastion might be one of those games you missed at the end of 2011 amongst all the Skyrim, so check it out.
Alright, well, Cinderwolf, you have a good one and thanks so much for calling in.
You too.
Alright, take care, buddy.
You guys too.
Oop, he cut out there at the end, but we'll just hope he said something nice.
Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio if you want to give us a call.
We've got time for about one more call.
We can fit in one more call, right?
So yes, Alan, while you were AFK, your kitties are finally starting to integrate with the show a little bit.
It's just a matter of time before we get Maruko on air with a comment.
Loki, that means they're warming up to you.
They're like, this guy ain't gonna leave.
They're like, it's been three hours and we're hungry.
We're going to just come out to the food dish.
Some of the chatters are asking for pictures, so I'll have to take one and put it on the website.
I mean, I have old pics, but... I have a Tumblr post that's bookmarked that I can link and chat.
Okay, yeah, do that.
They wouldn't be pictures from like right this second, though.
My iPhone camera is fucked.
The back camera, I think I scratched it or something, but there's too much exposure in one corner.
It looks blurry and greasy and shitty.
My touchscreen is starting to go out.
Your main thumb button at the bottom doesn't wake it up either.
I really need to get a new phone and technically I'm eligible for a free upgrade right now, but it's like I don't
I don't want a 4S, I want a 5.
So I can wait it out, right?
Yeah.
Right?
We'll see.
Mine, I think, is from my son dropping it on the floor over and over again.
Well, you should punish him.
All right, I'm just kidding.
All right, we got time for about one more call.
So let's try to get one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Yuni.
Hey, Yuni.
Tonight is like long time no talk night.
Like all these people that are calling in, I haven't heard from them forever.
This is awesome.
Well, how are you, Yuni?
I'm good, I have laryngitis, so forgive me if I sound weird.
It's alright, I'm just glad, you know, amongst all the comments of tonight being a sausage fest, I'm glad we get a lovely lady calling in.
This weekend we hung out with someone who probably has strep, so.
Yeah, so it's not strep.
It's a matter of time before I am sick too, probably for the next show I'll be coming in here.
and ZR5 Radio.
So Mr. Spanky will be making a return.
Yeah, Mr. Spanky will make a return.
Well, Uni, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to derail.
To what do we owe this phone call tonight?
What's on your mind?
I just missed you guys and I haven't heard you guys in forever.
When you were wishing Joe a happy birthday, which is Dark Tetsuya, sorry.
Happy birthday, Joe.
I know it is a little late, but I know.
I did go over to his Facebook and I did the appropriate because, you know, he loves it when John does this to me, the Rob, Rob, Rob thing.
So I went to his wall and said, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
What?
Happy birthday.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7 actually.
We have been on the air.
This is our 10th year.
June will be 10 years.
It's crazy.
I think I started listening in year 3.
So at least... So did I. Even though a lot...
So, so
Uni, what video games do you play these days?
I play World of Warcraft and Argent Dawn.
I have eight 85s.
Oh my god, that's great.
You know what?
I have noticed with this expansion, it's really easy for people to be in that multiple 85 camp now.
I never thought I would have more than one, and I have four.
I have four 85s on three different servers.
I also play StarCraft 2 I'm bronze rank but I play Protoss I need advice how do I get good at StarCraft 2?
Focus on your economy.
You focus on putting... Okay, I'm just going to say this.
Drones, probes, SUVs, whichever you play.
If you play Terran, it's SUVs.
Okay, what you do is you constantly pump those out.
Like around five minutes, you make your next expansion.
It's like a whole entire build order.
It's all about build order.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It smushes their faces in.
It's like hilarious.
That's what it's all about.
This is my favorite thing.
You're going to think I'm such a dumbass, but this is my favorite thing in StarCraft II is Star Jeweled.
Have you ever played Star Jeweled?
No.
Oh, you've got to check it out.
It's Bejeweled, and it's free.
It's like one of the custom maps.
Just go look for it.
It's a Blizzard map.
It's called Star Jeweled, and it mixes Bejeweled and StarCraft.
After the show, you've got to go check it out.
Let me ask you this real quick before we say goodbye.
Heart of the Swarm coming out soon, hopefully soon-ish.
What are you most looking forward to in Heart of the Swarm?
I'm mostly looking forward to Diablo 3.
The hardest one is going to be awesome, but I'm more looking forward to Diablo 3.
You know what?
That's a fair answer.
Because I'm in the same boat.
StarCraft 2, it's alright, but Diablo 3, bring it on.
Have you been able to play the beta at all?
No, I'm not in the beta.
I wish I was.
I don't mean to rub it in, but I did get in the beta a few months ago, so I have played through it, and it's very nice.
It's okay.
I don't hate you.
I love you, Rob.
I'm going to let you go if you want.
All right.
Yeah, sure.
We better wrap up the show.
It's after 9 o'clock or midnight for you East Coast folks.
All right.
We'll let you go.
But thanks so much for calling in and saying hello.
Okay.
Bye.
Take care.
Have fun.
Remember, Star Jeweled.
All right.
Bye.
Okay.
Bye.
Also, IyerChef is a lot of fun, too.
And there's a Left 4 Dead one, too.
It's like Left... I can't remember the name.
It's Left 4 something else.
Just look for that.
Somebody in chat will scream it out in a minute here.
Alright, we gotta wrap up.
Thank you so much for the calls.
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, although I gotta say that was an awesome night of Skype calls because we got to talk to like three people we haven't talked to in a long time.
Email bag is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com You could leave us a voicemail on the Skype line.
Sometimes we do play those if they're concise and to the point.
But yeah, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We only had two emails tonight, so those of you that didn't get through, get your... Excuse me.
Oh, radio's worst nightmare, the hiccups.
Get your thoughts in via email and we'll get those on the next show.
Alright, before we really put the bow on the show tonight and say we're done, I need to go over to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.
Or Alan.
Yes, THQ has come out and they've released a statement saying, no, they have not cancelled their 2014 lineup.
They are saying, additionally, we are thrilled with the great performance of Saints Row the Third, which on a like for the period in North America has tripled in sell-through from Saints Row 2.
In addition, WWE 12's worldwide sales are up 40% year over year.
as well as, according to the NPD, in the month of December, THQ was number five publisher overall, number four third party.
Also, they reported growth of 18% in the market.
That was down almost 6%.
All right, well, there you go.
Loki with breaking news here on OLR.
OLR.
THQ's not dead.
There it is.
I didn't think so.
I mean, they're one of the major publishers out there.
If there's any publisher that's gonna die, it would be... Okay, let me think.
Semi... Atari.
Atari's the next fucking publisher to go.
I mean, they're like clinging onto the grave.
You know what we need here at OLR?
We need the... I mean, this is kind of a sad game to play, though, but I don't know.
Like, it's always sad when studios close, but we do kind of need the publisher death pool.
You know how they have the celebrity death pool?
Like which celebrity is going to kick the bucket next?
Rotten.com has that, if you remember that site.
They're still around, aren't they?
Here's all that Atari has coming right now.
They have Test Drive Ferrari Legends, which is Test Drive Unlimited.
And also The Witcher 2, which is going to be coming to the consoles next.
I mean, The Witcher 2 did well on PC, but, dude, that's all they have.
And maybe, no, no, no, they're not doing any more Dragon Ball games.
That's it.
That's all they have.
So there's not a lot coming out.
All right.
Maybe we need to have that here.
That can be a segment on another Slow News Week, the publisher death pool.
And we'll see, take bets on which publisher's going to fold before the end of the year.
All right, any other breaking news, or was that it?
Well, this is not news, but the RetroDuo portable, the NES SNES portable system looks pretty sweet.
Oh, yeah.
The technology patent on that's expired.
So you're going to start seeing, just like you see all the Nintendo rip-offs now, you're going to start seeing Super Nintendo ones all over the place pretty soon.
So, alrighty.
Alan, I'm assuming you don't have any last minute stories tonight?
Nope.
Alright, I figured it.
But you do have pictures of cute kitties that I saw in the chat room.
Yes.
Thank you.
Alright, maybe, I don't know if Ranma can do this, but maybe he can reblog that over to the OLR Tumblr so everybody can see the kitties.
Yeah.
That'd be great.
All right.
That's going to do it then for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us tonight.
You know what we say, guys.
If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, all we do, we ask, tell a friend.
You know what?
Just say, hey, there's this show out there and they don't have a big magazine backing them or a website that gets hundreds of millions of hits.
But you should check them out because it's a fun time and come join us and chat sometime.
So help us spread the word.
You can do that by telling friends.
Leave a nice review on iTunes.
We always appreciate that too.
or, you know, just a little shout out in your signature on a forum or whatever.
We really appreciate all the word of mouth that we can get.
So thank you guys again.
We really appreciate it.
I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Alan, thank you so much for filling in at the last minute yet again.
You've done that twice this month.
You're welcome.
I owe you.
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
Thanks for letting me use your laptop.
You're welcome.
And I'm making orange chicken.
mmm can't wait and steamed rice delicious we're gonna eat that after the show wraps nom nom nom let's see my final thought is I just realized we have two posters in here that say haters to the left and one points one way and one points the other so I'm confused which way did the haters go because they're on opposite walls either out the front door or into the kitchen to cook for us okay fair enough I'm gonna say into the oven oh my god
Like the witch, like a Tansel and Gretel.
Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight.
My final thought is I really don't want to eat McDonald's anymore.
I'm going to try to stop.
Is that a late New Year's resolution?
Is that what I'm hearing over there?
No, it's been one I've been toiling around, and I was actually going to do that.
I was just running a little bit late this evening, so there wasn't really any time for me to stop anywhere else.
I could have heated up some soup, but I didn't have a lot of time to do that.
I made this
Cheddar and beer soup.
I don't care for it too much, though, because the beer didn't cook out.
And so it's got a lot of, you know, if you drink the whole pot of it, I guess you can get a little bit buzzed.
But it wasn't quite how I had pictured it.
I put too many leaks in it, too.
It's too sweet.
Sorry.
I'm laughing at what Actdeft said in chat.
And I'm assuming this is about the haters to the left sign that points to the kitchen.
Haters gonna bake.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
