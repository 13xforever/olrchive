00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Tonight, January 29, 2012, a network makeover is rumored for Nintendo consoles, a new handheld

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,600
may bring back a classic gaming system, and Steam goes mobile with a new iOS app.

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,040
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,720
We are live on this January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,720
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,360
First off, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Hi.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
How are you, Miss Summers?

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Been better.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
Been better?

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,120
It's kind of a gloomy Sunday, Sunday Bloody Sunday, like the U2 song.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:14,960
No, there's no big massacres and wars going on in my house and I don't live in Ireland

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
as people I'm sure would know that's what the song was about.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,800
That was not a PMS joke because that would be gross.

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,960
I could say it's Shark Week.

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,040
Are the communists invading?

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,440
That's none of anyone's business.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,440
However, I am very pissy.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,120
Well, so this week everybody better be extra careful on their spelling and grammar because

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,760
remember it's those little things that'll tick her off unless she gets chocolate.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,560
Everything has been pissing me off today, so it's going to be a great show.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
I didn't help because we were supposed to have a Pinkberry date today and I had to cancel

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,320
because my mommy just had surgery and I know she doesn't listen to the show, but I'm thinking

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
about my mother.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,040
She had surgery on Friday, but she's doing a lot better, so I had to go visit her today

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,760
because she's out of the hospital.

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,000
Anyhow, let's talk about who else is here with us here in studio.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
Hi.

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
How are you, Techmaster Loki?

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm fine.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Are you on your period or are we good?

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,280
I'm fine, I guess.

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,440
You're always angry on this show no matter what it is.

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,080
I was like, I don't know how to answer that.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Yes.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,520
What's new with Loki?

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,080
Um, not much.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Just playing Skyrim.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
All right.

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
Well, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit, but first I have to plug

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,600
of course the lovely All Games Radio where we do our show every week, www.allgames.com

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,420
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,860
It is where we tape live.

48
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,680
If you are listening live, and we hope you do sometime if you are been listening on the

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,280
podcast all these years, if you are listening live, join us in our chat room.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,080
Just point your browsers over to chat dot orange lounge radio.com and there's a fine

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,960
little Java chat room that will open right up and you can join our chat room.

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,600
If you prefer to do it the old school way, you can do it with an IRC client still because

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,200
our chat rooms IRC based and you just want to connect to the game surge network at IRC

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,480
dot game surge.net and we are in channel with the channel sign or the pound orange lounge

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
is where you can find us on IRC.

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Hey Rob.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Hey Rob.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Yes ma'am.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,120
I have to share the neat thing that I just posted in the chat room.

60
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Okay.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,960
Apparently some nerd has narrowed down when Ice Cube's good day was.

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,600
Like today was a good day?

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
What day was it?

64
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Well, I'll just.

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Wasn't today right?

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,200
I'll go through just a quickie on this one.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,400
The clues were what they were watching UMTV wraps, which started on August 6th, 1988.

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,480
The single was released on February 23rd, 93 and the Lakers beat the Supersonics.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,760
So they narrowed down all of those dates and then went to clue for the dates.

70
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,720
The Laker wins over the Supersonics was a clear day with no smog.

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,340
So they narrowed it down to November 30th, 88 and at the date in 89, 91 and 92 good Lord.

72
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,240
Some people have too much free time.

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,880
Clue five got a beep from Kim.

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,440
So it was when beepers were available.

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,800
So that led it to two dates, uh, January 18th, 91, January 20th, 92 clue six Ice Cube started

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,720
filming boys in the hood in 1991 there was only one day I'm going to quote this only

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,520
one day where UMTV wraps was on air.

78
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,200
It was a clear and smog less day.

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,960
Beepers were commercially sold Lakers beat the Supersonics and Ice Cube had no events

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:26,160
to attend January 20th, 1992 national good day day.

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,120
So we just celebrated 20 years of today was a good day 20 years ago.

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
Yeah.

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,260
What an incredibly useless piece of information, but I thought it was cool that someone went

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,000
to the trouble and I wanted to share it.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's when the good day was.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And those, and for those listening to orange on radio for the first time, those are the

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
lovely types of tidbits you can expect, but we will get into video games here in a minute.

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
First I have to apologize to livelicious and the podcasters.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
There was no live show last week and it was a little bit last minute.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,160
We had to cancel the show due to illness and I was a little bit self-conscious about it

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
last week.

92
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,680
I didn't want to talk about a whole lot, but I'll talk about it now.

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,440
I had pink eye, which is why we didn't have the show last week or is what, what did Victoria

94
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,360
call it I herps or something like that.

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:15,480
Look dark soccer just choked on her soda when I said that.

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,960
It's like, what am I seven and going to a preschool where kids are putting fingers in

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,920
their butt and their eye or something.

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,520
No, I work in a place with adults and stuff.

99
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
I don't know.

100
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,720
We had a pink eye outbreak at work.

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
It just ended plague.

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
I don't know what happened.

103
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,100
Someone got careless with the mascara.

104
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,000
I got pink because I w I do work with primarily women and I got pink guy just cause everybody

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
else in the office had it.

106
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,560
So unfortunately what that means is that nobody wants to come over to Rob's house where the

107
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,120
studio is or touch the equipment and everything like that because he has pink eye and when

108
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,240
one co-host has a kid at home and you know, the other just doesn't want pink eye, it kind

109
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
of fucks up the show for the night.

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh no, you are, you, I was eating cheesecake.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,320
Fuck your pink eye.

112
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,980
You had something else going on anyway.

113
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,360
You were going to miss two weeks in a row anyway because there was a, a family deal.

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Yeah.

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:15,320
And um, I, uh, it was a cousin's birthday at the cheesecake factory and I had fantastic

116
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,380
carrot cake cheesecake and Dan had food poisoning.

117
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,880
So um, and of course our chat room is lighting up pink guy, what the hell?

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,440
And uh, Kai's Judo's like, all it was, was pink eye WTF.

119
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
Yes.

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,180
But you have to remember pink eye is super duper contagious.

121
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,880
Like it's not like I lick the eyes of these women I work with.

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,480
Like if you touch something they've touched, you can get it like break room stuff, you

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
know?

124
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:46,340
So, so yeah, yeah, yet Alan who lives here with me never got it.

125
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,840
So I don't know what that's about.

126
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
Maybe you have natural immunity to the undead plague.

127
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,800
You will be the salvation of us all.

128
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,840
And I actually wiped down all of the mics and the studio area with Clark's wipes to

129
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
make sure.

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
You're so considerate.

131
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Yeah.

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
I never got pink eye.

133
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
So Rob's lying.

134
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
This whole story is a lie.

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,200
I had a very, very minor case of pink eye and yet it was like Alan went through here

136
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,440
in a hazmat suit making sure he would not get it no matter what happened.

137
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,840
So um, uh, Hamakara in our chat room at chat.orange.com says someone wasn't washing their hands after

138
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
using the potty.

139
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Okay.

140
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,400
First off, I find that to be one of the most disgusting habits of men that I see in the

141
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,080
potty is that I see guys who just walk in the restroom, do their thing, walk right out.

142
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
They don't even flush.

143
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
They don't even stop to walk, wash their hands.

144
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
And if that's you, especially if they're handling their junk or something, you know, and you

145
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
know who you are.

146
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
That's gross.

147
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,640
A flush B wash.

148
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
It's not that hard.

149
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:52,080
Although I will say it has been proven that the place with the most germs on the body

150
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,860
is actually the mouth and the hands.

151
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,600
So you were right about not washing the hands regularly.

152
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,760
However the butt is one of the cleanest places.

153
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,780
Thank you for that piece of information.

154
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,880
So what have I learned today?

155
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,180
January 20th was a good day and my ass is kind of clean after all.

156
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Thank you.

157
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
And urine is sterile.

158
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
All right.

159
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,800
Anyhow, I don't want to talk about my goddamn pink eye anymore.

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,640
Let's talk about, uh, let's talk about gaming.

161
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,720
I don't want to get into our gaming weeks.

162
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,520
I want to get right into the gaming news tonight or actually we can talk about one of two things

163
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,040
because we could talk about what's going on with Xbox and all these rumors about the new

164
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,560
Xbox and, and the, the used games and all that.

165
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,760
Or we could talk about RuPaul's drag race season four premiers tomorrow, which is the

166
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
best show on television.

167
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Am I right?

168
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Dark soccer.

169
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah, but there's really nothing.

170
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,520
I interviewed Tatiana once.

171
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,460
There's really nothing to talk about until it airs though.

172
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,400
That's true, but we can, so I guess, I guess we'll, we'll just combine the two worlds a

173
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
little bit.

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:14,560
I tried, all right, so going around an Xbox bullshit this week, I don't know.

175
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
It might be true, but look, I, it's the pink elephant in the room.

176
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Everybody's talking about it.

177
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,840
It's the whole, the new Xbox, which we're called, we will not call it the Xbox 720 here

178
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
on orange on radio.

179
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
That's not what it's going to be called.

181
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,000
We already decided weeks ago amongst a highly scientific process, we will refer to the system

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,120
as the Xbox lube until Microsoft gives us something better.

183
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,180
So the Xbox lube supposedly is not going to play, use games whatsoever that I guess there's

184
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:46,920
this amazing technology that will just fuck your disc up once you install a game or something

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,480
like Loki clue us all in, how is this technology supposed to work from what I don't fucking

186
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
know.

187
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
It doesn't exist.

188
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,920
So how am I, it's going to use these cardboard rings.

189
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,500
Basically what happens is they'll prompt you to enter in, um, a special code that's generated

190
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,440
by turning these rings so that, you know, you can create a certain phrase like for example,

191
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,000
you know, banana monkey pirate, or you'll have to get out the instruction manual and

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,780
look up the keyword on page 24, some of which may actually require the use of a decoder

193
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:32,360
device that will be a red plastic, a transparent piece of, um, of, uh, yeah, it's, it's, I

194
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
don't know codes.

195
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
I okay.

196
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
No.

197
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,200
What I think I was reading about what's supposed to happen is it's supposed to be that the

198
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,920
X box would have a burner in it, that the drive functions is both a burner and a reader.

199
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,560
And once you play the game for the first time, it would basically burn your console cereal

200
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,340
into the disc.

201
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,880
And at that point it would only work on that console.

202
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,680
And I'm like, that has got to be the most hideous idea I've ever heard.

203
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,320
Like really like, so I can't take a disc over to a friend's house anymore and play the game.

204
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,200
I mean, that's how crazy we're getting.

205
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
It's not going to happen.

206
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,600
I just, just even the way that they say that that's how that's going to work is retarded.

207
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,880
I mean, it's just, it's no, not even close to how it's going to work or they're not going

208
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
to do that.

209
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Okay.

210
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,560
First off, you know, you have companies like GameStop, basically if Microsoft were to do

211
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,480
that on system, that would cut out the whole used business altogether, which is a good

212
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,920
portion of where the revenue is for GameStop.

213
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,280
I mean, who is by far the biggest company out there selling games to consumers.

214
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,280
And it'd be also the same way if they decided, Hey, we're going to go digital only.

215
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,460
Now granted with that, they could, you know, sell the little cards that they're doing now

216
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,660
and that's fine.

217
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,300
But I mean, there's no, there's not a lot of money to be made in new games.

218
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,640
It's all used sales is where they're making their money and yeah, they could probably,

219
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,880
you know, for some sort of kickbacks from, you know, these, um, hardware manufacturers,

220
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,280
but it's not going to happen.

221
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,040
It's just not, no one's going to buy into that.

222
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,640
They're going to be like, fuck that bullshit.

223
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm going to buy a PlayStation or a Wii U.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,400
We definitely see game companies are already trying to kind of cut at the knees a little

225
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,600
bit of the used game market.

226
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,200
We see the online passes, but I see a big push towards digital distribution.

227
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,360
Like isn't the VEDA supposed to have the games are cheaper now to download than they are.

228
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,000
But they haven't released any of those yet.

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So we don't know.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,280
I mean, Japan, I mean it may be a little bit cheaper, but even still though, it's just

231
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,520
that stuff is kind of to entice you to buy new, not forcing you to buy new.

232
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,000
And I mean, they're not going to do anything like that anyways to tie it to one system

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,880
because come on, what company had a huge failure rate with their launch systems?

234
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
Who's really going to risk that bullshit?

235
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,120
Oh, I bought 20 games, but now they're all fucking useless because my system died.

236
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
I don't think so.

237
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,980
They're not going to do that.

238
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,560
It would be so ridiculous to even try to do that.

239
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,640
And let's just say that, I mean, that would be easy to break for hackers to break, oh,

240
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,840
let's make it burn stuff.

241
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,400
Oh, we'll just break the burner out of it.

242
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
It's not going to happen.

243
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,320
And fuck, they're not going to make a console with a goddamn burner that can actually read

244
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
those disks.

245
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,040
That's just like piracy right there.

246
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,080
Like, oh, no, one's going to hack that to burn games.

247
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh no, not at all.

248
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Of course.

249
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,640
Now, granted, I think that was only one theory about how it's all supposed to work.

250
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,240
I mean, that theory is so like vague and just like, well, here's how I think.

251
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
It doesn't make any sense.

252
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,020
They're just making assumptions.

253
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,720
There's no data to support that.

254
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Yes.

255
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,180
Will they continue on this trend where they're going to have, you know, some sort of code

256
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,520
that you put in to give you some extra something or other?

257
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Yeah, maybe.

258
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,040
Are they going to maybe do something where it's going to tie it to your console as far

259
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,600
as like your game saves or something?

260
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Maybe.

261
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
I don't know.

262
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,600
But I think Microsoft's a little bit more lax with that at least.

263
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,360
You're tying them to at least your profile, but even that you can get around.

264
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,460
I just don't think anyone's going to do anything that ballsy right now as far as making it

265
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,800
where the used games will just not play in the system.

266
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,660
Because I'm telling you, if one does that and the other ones don't, that's a big disadvantage

267
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
for them.

268
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,280
Because GameStop will just say, fuck you guys, I'm not going to support your system as much.

269
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,200
Well, you know what, Microsoft's in an interesting situation as well with the whole online pass

270
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,320
is that I don't think Microsoft can still justify the online pass for their first party

271
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
games.

272
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
And if they do it, there's going to be a lot of crap that they're going to start getting.

273
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Because notice they're the one company that kind of hasn't been able to do it yet because

274
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,740
they're charging for Xbox Live.

275
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,360
So I mean, literally they're going to start double dipping for online passes.

276
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,060
See here's the thing though, theirs is a little bit different.

277
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,740
It's the same, it's same but different I guess.

278
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,160
They have content that comes with the launch, I guess the launch pressing or whatever, the

279
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,820
first pressing of a game.

280
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,020
They have extra content that comes with it.

281
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,360
Now the thing is, so is they're not fucking putting out there saying, hey, this is our

282
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
online pass.

283
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,600
It's just, it's download content.

284
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,480
Like for example, I think with Alan Wake you got an episode or something for, it's like

285
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,600
the first piece of download content for free.

286
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,600
And that's cool that they're putting something in there for you to entice you to buy new.

287
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,440
And that's all they have to do to spin it with EA instead of saying, this is an online

288
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
pass.

289
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
They say, hey, guess what?

290
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,160
The launch, the first launch pressing of this game is going to get some extra download content

291
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
with it.

292
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,840
Oh my God, you don't even have to fucking call it an online pass.

293
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,560
Why did you call it an online pass?

294
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,720
There's such a negative connotation with that and you're just going to go and cut yourself

295
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,880
at the niche just because this is what you've done with the other games?

296
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,200
Just say, hey, look, it's a bonus DLC that we're putting out for those people that buy

297
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
new.

298
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,680
If you buy it used, you can still enjoy the wonderful game, but you're going to have to

299
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
buy the DLC.

300
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,160
I mean, that's not, that's not that bad and people can kind of expect that.

301
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,920
Why should I get fucking free DLC if I didn't buy the game new?

302
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,080
It's just how they're free, they really were dumb how they phrase it.

303
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,040
Going to our chat, I'm a chat that orange on a trader.com Amiga 777 says, unless the

304
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,300
next Xbox is download only, then that could be a problem.

305
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,680
It's not going to fucking happen.

306
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,800
Well, let me, let me say something for a minute.

307
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,040
You can't be download only because we all have those caps on the, like the Comcast service

308
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,160
and stuff is still 250 gig cap.

309
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,400
One Xbox 360 game.

310
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,580
If it's a big one, I mean, some of them don't really fill up the disc.

311
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,400
They're like maybe 900 megs.

312
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,560
Some of them though, like, you know, are probably what a good four or five gigabytes Blu-rays

313
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,520
especially on average six gigs.

314
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Yeah.

315
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,240
So I mean, you can only download so many of those and if you're streaming more movies,

316
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,580
something's going to give everybody wants a piece of this.

317
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,680
Now Xbox wants to charge me to, you know, download the game cause I can't buy it used

318
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
anymore.

319
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,000
But yet Comcast wants to charge me for using the bandwidth to download the game.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,760
I mean the consumers are going to reject this at some point.

321
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,860
They're going to say it's not worth it.

322
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,840
Go back to playing the old system.

323
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,220
Some people will buy digital downloads and they have that out there right now.

324
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,800
There's nothing wrong with offering things in multiple ways.

325
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,600
Whether you want to buy a new disc, you want to buy a used disc, you want to buy a digital

326
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,860
copy, you want to rent, whatever.

327
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,800
There's nothing wrong with that.

328
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Giving people options.

329
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,920
But when you start forcing people to download only, then people aren't going to buy your

330
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
system.

331
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Hello?

332
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
PSP Go.

333
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Yeah, I know.

334
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,280
I think the PSP Go is a great example of that.

335
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,920
I know people that own a PSP Go that actually really like the system from a hardware perspective

336
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
and all of that.

337
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,280
So it really sounds like what happened with the PSP Go was kind of a tragedy because their

338
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,880
whole implementing the digital download thing kind of got rejected by the user base as a

339
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,080
whole and only, you know, definitely people that were more into like hardware and, you

340
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,920
know, the game, gamophobes or whatever you want to call them, gamophiles, weren't really

341
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
into the system.

342
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,480
Otherwise, it was really rejected by people.

343
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,080
And I think if the game makers kind of go down that path of making these systems that

344
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,560
are going to be really complicated and expensive for the end user, I think they are going to

345
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,960
make a hideous mistake that most people, probably not the type of people who listen to this

346
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760
show, although I would say a good portion that, you know, listen to show or are gaming

347
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,960
enthusiasts and do podcasts, but most people, as in the people that carry the Nintendo Wii

348
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,760
to number one, are not going to feel like they need a new console.

349
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,760
They're not going to feel like they need to upgrade to this console because it sounds

350
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
like, like what?

351
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,200
You're going to charge me all this?

352
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,760
This sounds like a Divix machine.

353
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Okay.

354
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760
First off, most of those people are going to know what a Divix machine is.

355
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,160
You know what I mean, right?

356
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,800
Second, the people aren't going to be comfortable.

357
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,360
You know, your average consumer, sadly, is not comfortable with understanding how digital

358
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,880
downloads work and stuff.

359
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,760
They don't understand how that is.

360
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,800
And that's why they like WiiWare's taken off really for Nintendo as far as like, I think

361
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:21,040
more of the hardcore crowd because no one's, I mean, if they offered it in a way they presented

362
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,720
it like Wii Sports Resort had DLC or something like that, well, of course, you know, none

363
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,000
of the Nintendo games had DLC.

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,360
If they had DLC for like Wii Sports Resort, maybe they would have sold some stuff.

365
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,520
But I think most people aren't comfortable with that.

366
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,580
I mean, hell, with those wireless systems, I'd be willing to bet most people didn't know

367
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:45,280
how to hook it up to their internet, let alone be able to have the equipment to hook it up

368
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
to their internet.

369
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,080
Because a lot of people don't have wifi in their house.

370
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,520
Bochi Kawa in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, I saw a PSP go for sale at Kmart last

371
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,200
week and I said, huh, didn't know they still made those.

372
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,560
Oh, wait, those are probably just never taken off the shelf.

373
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,680
Dude, you're at Kmart.

374
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,380
I was at Kmart.

375
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,380
What did you find?

376
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,380
Dust bunnies?

377
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,760
No, I bought cat litter there.

378
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Okay.

379
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Because cat litter doesn't go bad.

380
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,080
It doesn't matter if it's five years old.

381
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,040
Do they still have the doors that have the pressure sensors that you step on to open

382
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
them up?

383
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,400
That's always fascinating.

384
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,920
Really I couldn't tell because they were very squishy anyway.

385
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,480
Do they still have the icy machines?

386
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,280
No, it didn't have an icy machine.

387
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
Everybody has icy machines now.

388
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
This is what I remember.

389
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,780
I did however go to the opening of a 7-Eleven and they gave up free Slurpees.

390
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Good times.

391
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,320
All right, going to the chat room from other comments on Loki's rants and this whole story.

392
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,800
Spazinator PC says, download only is risky.

393
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,560
Look at what I went through with Sony and my videos kind of referencing how he's, you

394
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,480
know, his PlayStations will break or he'll lose the license to his videos and he's had

395
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
this huge collection.

396
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,200
It's just a big pain in the butt.

397
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,180
Uni in our chat room says, I rather want a physical copy of the game.

398
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,040
It's all about the gratification.

399
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,160
And I agree with that too.

400
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,440
There is, you know, what happens to game collectors if things go digital only?

401
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,780
Like Dark Soccer, I imagine that's got to piss you off to no end because you're so,

402
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,360
you and Dan are so into like collecting that if everything goes digital, it's like, great.

403
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,160
What do I have to show for it?

404
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Bits and bytes.

405
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Great.

406
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Good job.

407
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:29,440
Because that there goes, you know, the need for your manuals for production material is

408
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
pissing me off.

409
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Well, let me put it this way, a lot of this stuff I think already is digital as far as

410
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,020
like, you know, Xbox Live Arcade, Xbox Indie Games, PlayStation Network, all that stuff.

411
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,240
There's a lot of digital content out there already.

412
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,040
I think if you're going to see anything in the new consoles, it's probably going to be

413
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,140
some sort of actual cloud streaming as well where you may have the option to stream your

414
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
game or whatever.

415
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,000
Instead of a demo, you get a time, you know, demo of the actual full game and get to play

416
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that.

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,320
You mean what they're doing now on PlayStation Plus?

418
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Sort of.

419
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,360
Or you can actually, you know, have games on demand almost like where you actually rent

420
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,360
them and play them that way.

421
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,920
Because that way the publisher still gets a, you know, kick out of that or kick back

422
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,400
and you know, it's all trackable and it's win-win.

423
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,560
Gamers get to try a game and the publishers get paid.

424
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,640
All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks or we'll be here all night.

425
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,400
So we're going to go around and talk about what video games we have been playing this

426
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,120
week and our impressions thereof.

427
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,640
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

428
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,320
Stupid computer just froze again.

429
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
No.

430
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,040
It does this thing where the cursor will freeze and it's seriously pissing me off.

431
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Okay.

432
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,320
Um, I played, I actually got Bubble Bobble for iPhone, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble.

433
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Best move.

434
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,200
I've been playing the crap out of it because if there's a puzzle game that I think I love

435
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,800
almost as much as P.O.P.O., it's Puzzle Bobble.

436
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,000
How does that work with the iOS Touch?

437
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,040
Do you just kind of touch on the grid where you want the bubble to fly or do you still

438
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
have to kind of drag?

439
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
You drag your finger across.

440
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Okay.

441
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,600
It kind of sucks though if you've accidentally tapped it and then, oh shoot, I sent the bubble

442
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
out.

443
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
But so far it's not like super hard.

444
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:21,520
I've gotten like a gold star on every level but one and I've beaten the first two areas.

445
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,880
So um, I've played that, I've played WoW.

446
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,760
I really haven't done a lot of playing of much of anything else though just because

447
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,160
I've been hurting.

448
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,520
So I was going to start Skyrim but I'd really rather play it on PC.

449
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,000
You should go check out how Alan's modded his all out.

450
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,080
He's made the inventory screens like usable.

451
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
It's pretty awesome.

452
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Cool.

453
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,360
That's one of the nice things about having it on PC I think.

454
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,200
But I'm still loyal to my P.A.S. 3 because I like to sit my big butt on the couch and

455
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
have my controller.

456
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,040
And Dan's lusting out for the new Borderlands.

457
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Oh yeah, yeah.

458
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Yeah.

459
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Soon.

460
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?

461
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,480
Um, well since it's been a few weeks, I've played quite a bit actually.

462
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,560
Of course, you know, there's new DLC for Saints Row the Third.

463
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:13,720
I mean, I kind of knew what it was going to be getting in, you know, just looking at it.

464
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,040
Basically the new Saints Row the Third DLC is Game Evil 7.

465
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,720
It's a bunch of side missions or activities if you will that you get to play on it.

466
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,160
And most of them are just kind of redressed activities from the regular game.

467
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,400
Like they have an escort mission where it's you're escorting Genki and then you run people

468
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,360
over with your car and that charges up a flamethrower that you torch people with.

469
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
It's very boring.

470
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,720
But, you know, and I've finished those.

471
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:50,480
And then of course there's also the one that's the sad panda one.

472
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
I can't remember.

473
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,480
It's some kitten thing where you're rolling around a giant ball and it looks like, oh,

474
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Katamari.

475
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,560
No, it's actually, it handles like a car.

476
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,200
It even has like the sounds of a car.

477
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
It's basically a car.

478
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,640
So you're running stuff over and it's just a mayhem mission like they have in the regular

479
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,840
game.

480
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,640
So that was neat, I guess.

481
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:18,160
And then of course there was another one that was basically just the regular Professor Genki,

482
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,820
just his normal running through a maze and killing mascots and stuff.

483
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,640
And then the one that was actually really weird that I thought was the most enjoyable

484
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,840
out of all of them, because it is actually unique, was where you're skydiving as a panda

485
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,280
through rings, landing on roofs and then chainsawing mascots and then skydiving down some more,

486
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,080
bouncing off of balloons and stuff like that.

487
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,400
It's really ridiculous.

488
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,600
But that was kind of fun because it was somewhat unique.

489
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,600
The only thing that's terrible about this is I finished the whole DLC portion in about

490
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,920
45 minutes.

491
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,480
Maybe less than 45 minutes.

492
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,100
I didn't get all the achievements.

493
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,520
I got about 80% of them.

494
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,960
But that's sad.

495
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,960
$7 for 45 minutes of entertainment.

496
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,200
I mean, really they could have added a lot more content to it, but they only put two

497
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,480
different levels of each activity that they added.

498
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,680
I mean, they could have added a ton more activities or at least more versions of it that are difficult,

499
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,880
more increasingly difficult.

500
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,800
But no, they took the easy way out and just pretty much put out the, I don't know, the

501
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,620
most minimal version of DLC as possible, which is very disappointing.

502
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,400
So I'm kind of hesitant on whether I'm going to be buying some more of the other DLC that's

503
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,520
going to be coming out.

504
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Probably because I do like Saints Row the Third and actually did go back and play some

505
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:44,500
of the car theft missions that I had problems with it glitching out.

506
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,200
And so I got some of those done, which is cool because I'm trying to get all the achievements

507
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,920
for that.

508
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,400
And then what else?

509
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,680
Oh, I played, I downloaded some indie games, I actually played one of them, which is DLC

510
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Quest.

511
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,240
Oh yeah, I remember that one.

512
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,080
DLC Quest, it's kind of funny, it's more of like, it's something that would be a free

513
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Flash game.

514
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,720
I mean, it's a cute little concept, but the game's over in less than an hour, but it's

515
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,460
a buck, so it's not that bad.

516
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,360
Better than paying $7 for 45 minutes.

517
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,000
So it was alright, I mean, I'd recommend if you want to check it out, but that's kind

518
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,840
of the problem with indie games, there's a lot of cool concepts on there, but when you

519
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,080
go and play them, they're really short.

520
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,600
It's kind of disappointing that it's not a full-fledged game.

521
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,440
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

522
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh, of course, tons of Skyrim.

523
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,400
I'm already, god, I don't even know, probably 120 hours into the game already.

524
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:56,160
Level 54, although once I glitch out the Ogma and Finium, that'll be level 81 soon enough.

525
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,480
And let's see, what else, did I do anything fun in Skyrim?

526
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,240
I don't know, the game's getting more glitchy, as I mentioned before, I'm having texture

527
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,960
problems now where it's not drawing the proper textures on things, and all sorts of weird

528
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
stuff happening.

529
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,300
But there's a new patch coming in really soon for Skyrim, right?

530
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,920
I don't think it's gonna fix it.

531
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,800
Every patch makes things worse, okay, I'm telling you.

532
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,680
So we'll see, at least that patch, though, at the very least, that is gonna fix the Blood

533
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,200
on Ice mission, the one that's all fucked up for me right now.

534
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,400
So I'm glad that's gonna be fixed soon.

535
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,600
And then, of course, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, I'm playing lots of that, and kicking

536
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
ass.

537
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Nice.

538
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,720
Alright, quickly, my gaming week, because there really hasn't been a whole lot I've

539
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,880
been playing this week outside of WoW, there's not a lot of World of Warcraft this week.

540
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,640
Okay, you know what, that's what I've been into.

541
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,720
There's not a lot of old games I've really gone back to visit, although we did manage

542
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,980
to get a copy of Toy Story Midway Mania on the Wii, because, you know, I love Disneyland,

543
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,780
I love the rides and all that stuff, so Midway Mania's one of my favorite rides.

544
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,040
So I was like, what the heck, let's just, you know, let's just check this out and see

545
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
what it's like.

546
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,420
And it's, okay, yeah, they try to emulate the ride by, basically you point the Wii mode

547
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,640
at the screen, you hit A, and try to hit the targets, but, as you can imagine, it's pretty

548
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
basic.

549
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,240
Did you play it in 3D?

550
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,880
No, I heard you could, but- It's supposed to come with glasses.

551
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,600
No, I had a used one, so maybe they didn't have it, yeah, so, so, I don't know.

552
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,200
I guess I'll have to, what are they, are they the red-blue, or are they the polarized ones?

553
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,480
I don't know, I think it's red-blue.

554
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,680
I wonder if it's kind of like the ride, which uses the polarized ones, I don't know.

555
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
No, it's not that fancy.

556
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,040
Maybe if I steal a copy from the ride, maybe it'll work at home?

557
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,200
No, they don't have, you don't have a TV that supports polarized glasses.

558
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,320
It's just, it's either red-blue or the cyan-purple, so.

559
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Yeah, I'm sure.

560
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,720
Or a cyan-green.

561
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,920
It's probably, you know, it's not gonna really change my opinion on the game.

562
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,080
They've tried to do some cute stuff with, like, you know, collecting stickers, and,

563
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,480
you know, all the levels are not quite the same that they are in the ride itself.

564
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,200
You feel a lot of influence from achievements and that whole thing.

565
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,640
You know, you gotta score so many points on a stage.

566
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,300
But everything's relatively easy, but you have to remember, it is, it's a Disney game.

567
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,940
It's more geared towards kids.

568
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,120
I bet it would be kind of fun to bring out at a party, especially with my friends that

569
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
love Disneyland.

570
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,880
Like, let's say Dark Sakura, myself, and maybe a couple of our other Disney-loving friends

571
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,420
got together and did some drinking.

572
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,680
This game might be fun.

573
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,240
Anything's fun with drinking.

574
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
Exactly!

575
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Otherwise...

576
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,560
No, a game would be fun with drinking.

577
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
What?

578
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,280
Is the Kinect Disneyland adventures, I think, would be fun.

579
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,800
I totally want that game still.

580
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,960
I've heard it's pretty good.

581
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,080
I don't have it myself, but I have some friends that have it.

582
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
It's surprisingly not as bad as you'd think.

583
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,440
There's also that other one, though, they're doing, was it the Pixar, was it, uh, Kinect

584
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,080
Rush, Disney Pixar adventure?

585
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
I hadn't heard of that, no.

586
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
It's coming out in March.

587
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Oh.

588
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,000
I wonder if that, is that similar to the Disneyland adventures?

589
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because it's just...

590
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Sort of.

591
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
California adventures, maybe?

592
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't know.

593
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
No, it's all Pixar movies.

594
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
No.

595
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,880
But they have, like, the Incredibles and stuff in there, and Ratatouille, and...

596
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Yeah.

597
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,000
And you wanna see Wall-E's in there, too, which is kinda cool.

598
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Very cool.

599
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,760
Alright, well, but, otherwise, that's really the only new game I've been playing this week.

600
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,200
Keep in mind, next week, I have Coming to My House Tuesday, Final Fantasy XIII-2, and

601
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Soulcalibur V.

602
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,240
So, it's gonna be a busy week next week.

603
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,960
I haven't finished XIII, so, you know what, I'm holding off on it, and...

604
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,760
Just, I, you know what, I never completely finished it either, but I'm not gonna, I,

605
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,400
I, I'm worried that's gonna stop a lot of people from playing it, but, you know what,

606
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,120
there's, just go watch the spoiler video online.

607
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,160
I already know what the spoiler is, but I still wanna finish the game.

608
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Yeah.

609
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,720
Well, Soulcalibur V is coming out this week, and, um, believe it or not, we know somebody

610
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,480
who's been able to get their hands on it already, and we're gonna call him right now, and he's

611
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,960
gonna come on and talk to us a little bit about Soulcalibur V!

612
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,080
And it's my buddy from the one and only, Hoard House!

613
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,040
Xtaphir should hopefully be on the line.

614
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Hello!

615
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Hello!

616
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Is this Xtaphir?

617
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
This is Xtaphir.

618
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Hey, Xtaphir!

619
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
How are you?

620
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Good!

621
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,800
I'm so glad we finally have an excuse to get you on Orange Lawn's radio, cause usually

622
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,320
it's, it's only ever Hoard House.

623
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,520
I know!

624
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,560
But you have been able to play Soulcalibur V, right?

625
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
This is true.

626
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Alright, now, I don't know how you did that, but I'm not gonna ask questions, but, okay,

627
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,440
so you had to play Soulcalibur V, so, first off, now, I think our listeners have to remember,

628
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,160
you, you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?

629
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,920
You play a lot of WoW, but you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?

630
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,080
Um, not, not usually.

631
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:45,560
I, I got a PS3 last year, and I, um, you know, I, I played through Uncharted 2, and I have

632
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,600
a few fighting games, like, well, a couple fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street

633
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:57,560
Fighter IV, so, uh, you know, I, I've been, I've been getting, uh, you know, down with

634
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,280
console games lately, you know?

635
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
You getting jiggy with it?

636
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,760
And jiggy with the consoles?

637
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Yeah.

638
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,640
I, I guess.

639
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,320
Have you ever played a Soulcalibur game in your life?

640
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
Yes.

641
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Okay.

642
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,400
I played, I, well, I actually played the original Soul Blade, which I guess was Soul Edge in

643
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:23,720
Japan, and, uh, and so I, I do, I did, uh, play that when it came out on the PlayStation,

644
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,520
um, you know, years and years and years ago, and then, um, I played Soulcalibur 2 when

645
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,200
I actually lived with you, um, because I remember you got the Weaver, or it was the GameCube

646
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,200
version with Link in it, and so I do remember playing that, but that was the last time I

647
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,800
ever played Soulcalibur, any kind of Soulcalibur game was, uh, you know, your copy of Soulcalibur

648
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
2.

649
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Well, you know what you're saying isn't different from a lot of people.

650
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,560
A lot of people missed Soulcalibur 3 because it was kind of late in the PlayStation 2 lifespan,

651
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,880
and if I remember right, it was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so it never came out to the other

652
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
consoles.

653
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,760
Then Soulcalibur 4, some people saw Darth Vader and Yoda on the box and were like, no

654
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
thank you.

655
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,480
Although, I think, I think Soulcalibur 4 wasn't bad.

656
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,960
I like all the Soulcalibur games, but, alright, so here we are, Soulcalibur 5, so tell us

657
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,920
a little bit about the game.

658
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:28,880
Yeah, I was lucky enough to get a collector's edition, and I was, you know, didn't really

659
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:36,200
know what to expect, so I started playing with the story mode, which, I don't know what

660
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,960
it is about fighting games and story modes, but they're all lame.

661
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,160
They all, like, I think that the story mode is kind of cheap.

662
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:53,080
All of the cutscenes are like little, you know, comic book pictures, and you just see

663
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,400
little, you see little blurbs of what's going on, you know, and they do have voice acting

664
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,900
accompanying it.

665
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,120
But who plays fighting games for the stories?

666
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Who plays fighting games for the stories?

667
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,160
And I'm going to get emails from angry fighting game fans.

668
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
I do.

669
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,200
But then again, Street Fighter 4 had a really cool story mode and had that little anime

670
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
thing that went along with it, too.

671
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,320
So it was actually really immersive, and I've always liked the Street Fighter stories.

672
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,480
But Soulcalibur 5 gave you comic book and bad acting.

673
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,240
Yeah, well, it wasn't that it was bad acting, it was just, it just felt kind of cheap.

674
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,200
But they do have cutscenes, it's just the, well, animated cutscenes, they're kind of

675
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,000
few and, you know, you blink and you miss them.

676
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,620
But in terms of the fighting portion of the game, I love it.

677
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,560
I think it's really cool.

678
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,840
And the thing is, you know, of course, I'm used to Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2,

679
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,000
you know, or Street Fighter 4.

680
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,700
And so I was half thinking when I hit up, I'm going to jump.

681
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,520
And so when I didn't, I'm like, Oh, God, like, this is 3D, right?

682
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
Like I'm not I'm not used to that.

683
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm more used to the 2D fighting style.

684
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,120
So it was kind of disorienting for me.

685
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,680
But that's just a personal thing.

686
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,640
But I really think the graphics and the way the fighting works and everything I kind of

687
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
you kind of ease into it.

688
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,880
And I think that Soulcalibur is kind of user friendly.

689
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,320
When it comes to fighting.

690
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:39,000
I think it's a really good game to be introduced to if you haven't ever done any 3D fighting

691
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,640
games before.

692
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,920
And I said, like, a tutorial or something was that was there a tutorial or something?

693
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:53,160
No, there's no well, there is a training mode and they kind of hold your hand through combos

694
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,520
and all that stuff.

695
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,200
But it's just in terms of, I don't know, it just felt like really intuitive, like, you

696
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:09,240
know, there's not much to every move that you you make feels like a special move because

697
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,280
it all has flashy graphics and everything is just kind of it's aesthetically pleasing,

698
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,240
I guess is what I'm trying to get at.

699
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,200
Now I know I know you had a minute to play around with the create your own character

700
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,040
mode, which has been a popular part of Soulcalibur since the third one.

701
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,320
What did you think of create a character?

702
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,680
Oh, I love it.

703
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,080
I think it's, I think it's really good.

704
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,440
I mean, they have a ton of options that you can do.

705
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,280
I made a black chick chick and I named her Rob after you because you're a black chick.

706
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Thank you.

707
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Thank you.

708
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Yeah.

709
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
I appreciate it.

710
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Yeah.

711
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,760
And you can you can make her her special moves.

712
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,480
Have like a little, you know, aura and you are, you know, and make that excuse me make

713
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,760
that aura a color and I made it purple.

714
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
Like Tinky Winky.

715
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
I appreciate that.

716
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
Oh, no problem.

717
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Whatever.

718
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,280
I don't get that.

719
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,800
But um, yeah, it's it's really cool.

720
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,560
And then then I brought it over to my brother in laws and he was able to make a character

721
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,240
that looks a lot like Cole from what's an infamous and and my sister made a character

722
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,840
that I can't quite describe.

723
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:34,840
She looks like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica, but with like, a monk's outfit on and like

724
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,640
some kind of like really heavy looking.

725
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,000
She has like heavy looking gauntlets on or something.

726
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,040
It's like really weird.

727
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,800
So that's something that a lot of people in Soul Calibur will do is they try to like copy

728
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,400
characters from you know, popular culture and stuff best they can and they create a

729
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,580
character mode.

730
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,000
So yeah, and then fuck them up.

731
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

732
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,680
Because you can't ever get it perfect in Soul Calibur.

733
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,140
So did you did you get to do any verses like were you playing against other people and

734
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
you know,

735
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,160
no, because the game isn't isn't really out yet.

736
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,960
I tried to go online, but it said nobody's playing the game or whatever it like didn't

737
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,240
let me connect to anybody.

738
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,040
So I didn't really get to experience the online element to the game.

739
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,480
But I'm sure that it has a nice user interface.

740
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,520
So there's that.

741
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Okay.

742
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,080
It has a nice interface.

743
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,480
I appreciate that.

744
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Yeah.

745
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
All right.

746
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,120
So anything else that the OLR listeners should know about Soul Calibur five before it comes

747
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,560
out this week?

748
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,000
I think that it's it's a good game.

749
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,560
I mean, if you like fighting games, and you like 3d fighting games in particular, like

750
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,280
I don't think you'll be disappointed.

751
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,840
I think that from what I hear, I read a few reviews on it.

752
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,160
And they seem to think that it's improved from since Soul Calibur four, I guess there

753
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,200
were some little buggy issues that they say that it's improved on.

754
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:15,220
But they also kind of echo my my opinion that the story the single player story mode is

755
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,880
kind of, you know, kind of cheap, but whatever, you know, it's a fighting game.

756
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,280
You don't you don't play for the story, but no, you just want to wrestle.

757
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,480
That's why we play fighting games, you know, sometimes you just want to wrestle.

758
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Exactly.

759
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
You know.

760
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
All right.

761
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Well, extra for I gotta let you go.

762
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
So we get to some gaming news.

763
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,320
But thank you for coming on and talking about Soul Calibur five.

764
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,460
What would you give it on a scale of one to 10?

765
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,920
I would give it Can I do point five?

766
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Sure.

767
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
I'll do do 8.5.

768
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
How about that?

769
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
Good.

770
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Good.

771
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,760
Because we have to always have that arbitrary score for no particular reason.

772
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
Yeah.

773
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,680
So before we let you go, is there anything you want to plug?

774
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Somebody's but

775
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,280
well, we hope this show will help you in accomplishing that.

776
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,680
Oh, okay.

777
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm sure this show will.

778
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
All right.

779
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Me that.

780
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
All right.

781
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
Bye extrovert.

782
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Okay.

783
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Bye.

784
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,680
All right.

785
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:14,520
The one and only expert from Hoard House www.hoardhouse.com World of Warcraft discussion,

786
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
and so forth.

787
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
All right.

788
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,680
Let's get into some actual gaming news now.

789
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,880
Oh, housekeeping real quick.

790
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,120
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio or our Twitter, twitter.com slash

791
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
OLR.

792
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,800
As far as our upcoming schedule of shows, we are scheduled to be here every week.

793
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,080
Yes, we will be here next week.

794
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,840
I know it's Super Bowl Sunday, but whatever.

795
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,360
So our local team isn't even in it anyway.

796
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
So whatever.

797
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,680
Uh, and, uh, yeah, so we'll be here and throughout, I don't see any weeks off coming up.

798
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Do you have any, do you have any more cheesecake dates, star soccer that I need to be aware

799
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
of?

800
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Huh?

801
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
All right.

802
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,600
Excuse me.

803
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,160
Let's get into some, uh, gaming news then Loki.

804
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
All right.

805
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:06,920
Uh, let's start off with talking about some ridiculous rumors regarding the Xbox lube.

806
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:15,640
And um, of course the rumor is that apparently the new system will launch on holiday 2013

807
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:23,080
and it's going to launch with a new GPU that's going to be put out by, um, ATI or AMD I guess

808
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,440
at this point.

809
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:34,460
It's um, I guess part of the AMD 6,000 series, um, which is roughly about 20%, uh, more performance

810
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,000
power than the Wii U, at least what the Wii U is specced at right now.

811
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,960
And also, um, apparently it is, uh, quite a bit stronger than, uh, the Xbox 360 and

812
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
PlayStation three.

813
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,760
Obviously, I mean, why would you put out a system with a graphics card or a graphics

814
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,600
chip that's not, I mean, put out the same stuff with more copy protection, two of them

815
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
together.

816
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Call it a weed.

817
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
No.

818
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:10,200
So yeah, it's going to support DirectX or the Radeon, uh, HD, uh, 66, 70, which is what

819
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,920
this chip is going to be sort of based on, uh, supports DirectX 11, which is going to

820
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
look nice.

821
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,080
A 10 ADP HD multi display output, 3d and a bunch of other fun stuff.

822
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,680
I mean, and that's what it's assumed as right now, what they're going to be using.

823
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,920
I guess they're already manufacturing the chips for it, so we'll see.

824
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,760
I mean, it's all rumors, so we'll know until they officially announce it, which they could,

825
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,900
they could announce the new systems coming.

826
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,280
Do rumors like this really even matter?

827
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,440
Because the whole, like the Xbox will be whatever it's called, will be more powerful.

828
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Duh.

829
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,180
It's all potential.

830
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,960
This just basically says potential.

831
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,800
I mean, however they use that, it's hard to say.

832
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,960
I mean, and even the chips that are in the Xbox 360 right now compared to today's standards

833
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,000
are not powerful at all.

834
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,760
But it's just how they use it.

835
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,400
Um, so it's, it's, I mean, it's hard to say what it will look like.

836
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,860
I'm sure it'll look nice, but also I think a lot of it has to do with when you put the

837
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,560
specs out there, then your competition can see it and they know how to one up you.

838
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,480
So one reason I would think that Microsoft may not want to put it out there this year

839
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,300
is that they don't want Sony to know what's going in there because then Sony will just

840
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,080
do whatever they have to do to one up it.

841
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,360
I could still do that anyways.

842
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,440
They put their system out longer, but the thing is it's not like, Oh, well we're going

843
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,400
to use the AMD 7,000 instead they have a manufacturer fucking thousands of these chips or millions

844
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
of these chips.

845
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,040
You know, they're not going to just all of a sudden change their mind because IGN's reporting

846
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,160
on something that it's a rumor inside source.

847
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:55,440
They're going to put the most powerful GPU CPU that they can in the system and still

848
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,300
make it cost effective for the consumer.

849
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,300
That's what they're going to do.

850
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:04,920
I mean, I mean, they're not going to, they're going to put an old, uh, the Intel, what's

851
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,040
it like seller graphics card 500 or whatever.

852
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,040
All right.

853
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,120
Moving on to games that are going to be coming out a lot sooner than whatever the next X-Box

854
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
is.

855
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Resident Evil Revelations.

856
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,320
There was a couple of news stories going around about it this week.

857
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,520
One, the demo is out.

858
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,580
I didn't mention it during my gaming week cause I don't like to review demos, but I

859
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,680
did download the demo for Resident Evil Revelations.

860
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,040
I thought it was interesting because on the 3DS, when you download the demo, or at least

861
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,880
this one, it says uses left 30, meaning I would get to play the demo 30 times.

862
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
And then what?

863
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,880
I don't know.

864
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,880
Do I have to delete it and download it again?

865
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,280
Or, or will my system like know that, Oh, I can't play any, I'm milking this demo for

866
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,560
all it's worth having played through it 30 times.

867
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,400
Has anyone ever played a demo 30 times?

868
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,640
I'm trying to think if I've ever loved a demo that much.

869
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
I have once.

870
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Yes.

871
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,640
Really?

872
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,640
Okay.

873
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,640
What, what?

874
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,640
Jumping Flash.

875
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,640
Really?

876
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,400
I played the demo of Jumping Flash for weeks, several times a day, cause it was so freaking

877
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,800
fun and I couldn't afford the game at the time.

878
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,200
Alan wants to comment.

879
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,520
I played the Bayonetta demo at least two dozen times.

880
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,960
The Bayonetta demo was pretty sweet.

881
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,200
I'll give it that.

882
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Logie?

883
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,840
The original Cool Borders demo.

884
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,120
I played that tons of times.

885
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,480
And the original Saints Row demo.

886
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,880
It was a 30 minute demo and I played that over and over and over again.

887
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,480
The Final Fantasy, uh, eight demo.

888
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,200
I would say maybe the demo for Parappa the Rappa.

889
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,200
Yes.

890
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,040
I played that a bunch too.

891
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,040
That's the only thing.

892
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,040
And the Umjammerlami one.

893
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,040
Oh.

894
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
I played that a bunch too.

895
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,040
Okay.

896
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,040
Okay.

897
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,840
Well anyway, look, I don't think Resident Evil Revelations is going to be one of those

898
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
games.

899
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,440
Maybe, I don't know, maybe for you it will be whatever.

900
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,080
I played it and I was like, this is kind of neat.

901
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,480
I like the 3d effects and it's, it's cool.

902
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,240
It's, you know, it's, you know, got that scary Resident Evil S kind of like, like the older

903
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,120
games had kind of feels a lot more like that, but I'm going to be honest.

904
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,120
What do they want for this game?

905
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,120
New?

906
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,200
They wanted what, 50 bucks at one point and then they dropped it down to 40, right?

907
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
Yes.

908
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,640
And I don't think I, I don't personally, I'm not into the series enough where I can justify

909
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,640
40 bucks.

910
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,520
I know there are some people that will, and that's cool.

911
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,320
I don't think they're going to be terribly disappointed, but, uh, just, you know, not

912
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,920
so much for me.

913
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,220
But those that are getting on this game early are going to get something that's a bit of

914
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,480
a blessing and a curse.

915
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,160
And there's a lot of lulls going around the internet about that this week.

916
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,880
I mean, this is on the front page of Yahoo.

917
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:34,040
I saw this is the fact that the Resident Evil Revelations box art is spelled wrong.

918
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,880
That was only review copies on the side.

919
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,880
It's only, well, they're saying it's the it's well, Capcom put out a statement.

920
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,760
Uh, it has come to our attention that there was a misspelling on the Resident Evil Revelations

921
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
packaging.

922
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,480
We apologize for the mistake, which will be corrected for subsequent productions of the

923
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
game.

924
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,000
It makes it sound like the first printing cause it, the first printing has to already

925
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
be out there.

926
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,720
It's, it's hitting shelves on the seventh, right?

927
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,360
You're so funny with your print.

928
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:02,320
Remember way back when Okami came out and the, we, and there was an IGN watermark on

929
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
it.

930
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,320
Oh yeah.

931
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
Oh God.

932
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
That was funny.

933
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,280
They had to like recall them all or something or no, they had the substitute box art and

934
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,280
you know what?

935
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,520
I didn't even own the game and I got the substitute box art.

936
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,180
Well, they're going to do something similar for this.

937
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,760
They are saying that they might, uh, actually be, I guess they're going to work on a solution

938
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,400
to provide affected customers with the correct packaging.

939
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,760
But in my mind, I'm thinking the value of the misspelled ones just shot like way up.

940
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,520
Nah, no, you don't think I beg to differ with Logie.

941
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:40,620
Monopoly and I'm thinking like baseball cards that are spelled on or is it in reference

942
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,620
to a game?

943
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Yeah.

944
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,620
Uh huh.

945
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:48,480
There was a release of Monopoly on the Sega master system that had it mono space pulley.

946
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,720
But was that in the game or on the box art?

947
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,120
On the box art, on the cartridge.

948
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,680
Nice.

949
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,040
And it's a collector's item.

950
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,660
But here's the thing, and this is the only thing I can think of where I do somewhat agree

951
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,660
with Logie.

952
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,400
Like I agree with you with the classic stuff, but then Logie, I'm thinking that stuff is

953
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,480
really easy to fake in this day and age with the types of color printers we have.

954
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,280
You know, like how easy would that be?

955
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,960
There's ways around it.

956
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:18,840
There are ways to find if it's a fake because, okay, first of all, you'd be dealing with

957
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,560
the pound of paper that they use.

958
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,040
You would, uh, you would be dealing with their print resolutions.

959
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,600
You would be dealing with, you can actually sometimes tell what type of printer was used

960
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,640
for something just by looking with, there's a, with a, what's it called?

961
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,280
A loop at the, um, the print itself.

962
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,280
Yeah.

963
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,360
And it says, I hear that eBay is lighting up with high prices for the misspelled ones.

964
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,340
Be careful with something like eBay.

965
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:53,280
Just, you know, remember, go back a few episodes, uh, slate or excuse me, Alan got me a birthday

966
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,640
present game on eBay that ended up coming from China and it was the wrong damn game.

967
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,240
He bought me, he bought me child of Eden and we ended up getting a copy of Assassin's Creed

968
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
brotherhood.

969
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,480
It was a bootleg of the wrong game.

970
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,480
It was a bootleg of the wrong game.

971
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
It was ridiculous.

972
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,480
Just be careful with eBay.

973
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,800
Not knocking eBay and get a lot of good stuff there, but be very careful with video games.

974
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
Oh yeah.

975
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,520
There are lots of people that will take advantage of you.

976
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,520
That reminds me before I forget.

977
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,800
I do have master system games to be sending out, um, probably in the next couple of weeks.

978
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Awesome.

979
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,800
To winners.

980
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,800
Good.

981
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Good deal.

982
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,800
I haven't forgotten about you guys.

983
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
And, uh, I did have a story here.

984
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,320
We already mentioned it though because of the four gigabyte cartridge that resident evil

985
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,680
revelations uses as opposed to the two gigabyte cartridge.

986
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,800
They were trying to justify a $50 price tag.

987
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,800
Well that didn't last.

988
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,720
They did officially drop it to $40, but you may think about, well, if you want to play

989
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,560
it with a circle pad pro, you're going to have to dump an extra $20 on it anyway.

990
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,800
So it's really not that cheap.

991
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,800
Well, cool.

992
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,240
I saved myself 60 bucks.

993
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,840
Which would you download it or something?

994
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,400
No, I'm just not going to play it.

995
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,400
Okay.

996
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,400
Anyhow.

997
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,320
All right, let's move on.

998
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
Tark Sagra.

999
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,840
Well, um, I never can pronounce the name of this company, right?

1000
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
Is it ASIS or ASIS or A-S-U-S?

1001
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
ASUS?

1002
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
A-S-U-S.

1003
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Yeah.

1004
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
Like Loki's laptop.

1005
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
ASUS.

1006
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
ASUS.

1007
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,840
Um, but...

1008
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,840
I think most people say A-S-U-S.

1009
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Yeah.

1010
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:28,120
At any rate, um, there is a, uh, note that there is a PC connect SKU, um, going to be

1011
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,760
coming out for an ASIS, uh, laptop.

1012
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,520
It's going to apparently have a built-in Kinect sensor.

1013
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,480
It's, uh, just licensed out by Microsoft.

1014
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:46,240
Um, they're not doing the, I guess, the creation of the item itself, but, um, Microsoft did

1015
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,800
confirm that the laptops are going to have Kinect's functionality built in.

1016
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,840
And of course, you know, we know the standalone PC Kinect is going to be out, um, on February

1017
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,600
1st for $249.

1018
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
I'm not surprised.

1019
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,200
They already, I think they already said that they're going to be trying to integrate that

1020
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
in the PCs.

1021
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
I mean, it makes sense.

1022
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,120
You're not going to have just a separate Kinect sensor that's going to be separate from the

1023
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,120
laptop.

1024
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,120
Of course it's going to be integrated.

1025
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,120
Makes sense.

1026
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,640
See, honestly, something like that would be great for me when too much typing, you know,

1027
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,120
starts to hurt after a while.

1028
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
You know, air type.

1029
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,240
That would just be pretty awesome.

1030
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,200
But I mean, I guess for a laptop, I don't know how it would make as much sense as having

1031
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,520
something like that for a PC because, you know, a lot of people do PC gaming and we

1032
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,080
have a PC hooked up to our TV in the front room.

1033
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,080
Something like that would be a good idea.

1034
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,200
I just don't see exactly how it would work for a laptop unless it's for like virtual

1035
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,440
keyboard and disabled services.

1036
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
So.

1037
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,080
All right.

1038
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:53,760
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, this is kind of funny, um, the Wii U getting

1039
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,400
a brand new, uh, network to go along with it, which is good.

1040
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,480
I mean, cause right now what they've got for, I don't even know if you really call it and

1041
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,620
there was a wifi connect or something like that, which I guess that's, that makes sense

1042
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:12,240
for like, you know, the Wii and the Nintendo wifi connection.

1043
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
Yes.

1044
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,660
The Wii and the DS because those are all wifi, but I don't know if the Wii U is wifi.

1045
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,200
So that wouldn't make much sense if it was a wired connection.

1046
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,620
But um, the Wii U is getting this brand new thing called the Nintendo network and it's

1047
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,960
actually going to start with the 3DS.

1048
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,960
Um, this was kind of leaked out a little bit early with the new Final Fantasy theater was

1049
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,720
a the rhythm, um, cover actually the logo on there.

1050
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,820
And then of course, Nintendo, uh, was talking a little bit about it as part of an investor

1051
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,360
presentation and some of the things that are going to be coming with the Nintendo network

1052
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,240
communities of Mario Kart seven players.

1053
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,780
So they're going to have some sort of community feature with that already has communities

1054
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,780
in it.

1055
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,780
So are they expanding that?

1056
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,640
I guess that would be cool if there's like web integration or something like, you know,

1057
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,400
things that were in halo three like five years ago.

1058
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,840
Well they're saying, they're saying that community building functionality that, um, they've already

1059
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,560
implemented in Mario Kart seven.

1060
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,000
So I don't know if they're still expanding on that, but um, they're also doing an add

1061
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,280
on content sales and the fact that they don't have DLC yet.

1062
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,280
Come on.

1063
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
What do you do?

1064
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,280
Rockband has DLC.

1065
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,280
Yeah.

1066
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,120
For the Wii, but not like on the three D S and the DS and stuff like that.

1067
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,120
All right.

1068
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,120
Whatever.

1069
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120
All right.

1070
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Okay.

1071
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,800
Um, preparing for digital distribution of package software.

1072
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,920
So I mean, they're going to have some, you know, downloadable games, I guess.

1073
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,520
And the introduction of personal accounts for the Wii U, which in my opinion is the

1074
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,640
only actual new news in here.

1075
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,640
Yeah.

1076
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,640
Yeah.

1077
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,660
I mean, because yes, I understand that now Nintendo is saying they could sell full games

1078
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,800
online or whatever, but virtual console is full games.

1079
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,760
The three DS shots, bigger, full games are fantastic that you can sell full games online.

1080
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,920
Welcome to 10 years ago for everybody else.

1081
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,000
I mean, it's like, come on, where the fuck have you been Nintendo?

1082
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,560
But yay for them finally catching up because I would like to see a Nintendo console that

1083
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,400
understands online.

1084
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,880
So that'd be nice.

1085
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:19,880
Um, but uh, yeah, um, the fact that they are, um, you know, finally doing this whole personal

1086
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,600
accounts and maybe that means no more friend code.

1087
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,960
I hope we'll see.

1088
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,960
I would hope not.

1089
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,520
I don't like friend codes there.

1090
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,520
Who does?

1091
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,640
Does anyone like friend codes?

1092
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,040
I don't like friends.

1093
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,280
No, it was an overrated TV show.

1094
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,280
I agree.

1095
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,200
I really don't like that show, except I always liked when what's her face, his hair would

1096
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,000
frizz out because it totally reminded me of going back to Alabama.

1097
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,120
All right, so Nintendo network, when will we get like, I know we've had investor information,

1098
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,440
but when do we get the real information?

1099
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,040
Have they said anything about that or no?

1100
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,040
Nope.

1101
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,040
Soon.

1102
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,040
E3.

1103
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,040
Right?

1104
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,040
Probably.

1105
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,040
Hey, guess what guys?

1106
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:12,000
We have this little technology that we're in implements called patching our games.

1107
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Downloadable content.

1108
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,760
It's like getting the new game, but you're downloading extra pieces.

1109
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,040
Now I know this is totally revolutionary and you only have to pay a hundred Mario coins

1110
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,000
to unlock the online features.

1111
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:35,020
This thing that we're going to call the wifi pass, uh, you need to play the play as Luigi

1112
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,020
though.

1113
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:40,560
They should really, I think that the only two lazy to walk, do you need to buy extra

1114
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,560
play coins?

1115
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,220
You can unlock stationary and swap notes DLC that's going to have it.

1116
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,220
Watch it happen.

1117
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:54,080
DLC quest with the first DLC you buy is the ability to walk left and animations.

1118
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
And then I love it.

1119
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:01,420
The, uh, sexy outfit, um, DLC that you can get in DLC quests, add sexy outfits to everybody

1120
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,420
in the game.

1121
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,080
It's the bikinis all around fun.

1122
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
Good times.

1123
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,240
All right, well let's move on and talk about guy.

1124
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,520
Kai, you know, guy Kai is one of those online streaming networks, kind of like on live and

1125
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
so forth.

1126
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,880
Um, guy Kai is going to be doing a full game streaming services on the various gaming and

1127
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,480
entertainment websites that they, um, we'll be working with now.

1128
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,480
Right now.

1129
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,480
They only do demos.

1130
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,480
That's the difference right now.

1131
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,340
Guy Kai specializes in demos, but they are going to be doing full game streaming services.

1132
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:35,200
Now here's the thing, one of those partners involved is Facebook, which you know, if you

1133
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,240
might've heard of it, it's a pretty popular website.

1134
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:43,080
Um, also guy Kai is supposed to be doing stuff with YouTube, best buy Walmart, and even directly

1135
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:48,240
with the publishers, EA and Ubisoft full game streaming is supposed to go about 90 days

1136
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,180
after the Facebook version begins, which is going to be very soon.

1137
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,600
Guy Kai does compete with on live, but, um, the folks behind guy Kai, including the head,

1138
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,360
Dave Perry says that one of the big difference between the two companies is they have to

1139
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,680
modify the game.

1140
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,460
They have to get the source code to the game.

1141
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,280
Guy Kai does not require modification of the game.

1142
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,280
So throwing a little shade at the competition, they're saying, basically we can just stream

1143
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,280
the game.

1144
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,240
Um, guy Kai is not planned for consoles, uh, but they are, you know, saying, you know,

1145
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,560
this could work on consoles basically.

1146
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,800
So very interesting that that could be integrated with Facebook soon.

1147
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,640
Cause especially because Facebook games, you know, are still kind of a big thing.

1148
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,760
There's a lot that people play.

1149
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,740
I've, I've heard that a lot of them are dying.

1150
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,120
Like there's not nearly as many farmers in Farmville as there were some time ago, but

1151
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:42,200
I will admit as terrible as they are, I can't stop playing like the pressure luck.

1152
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,340
There's a new pressure luck game on Facebook and you get to actually spin the board and

1153
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,280
hit the button and go, no whammies, no whammies.

1154
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,740
You know, it's kind of, kind of fun cause you're playing against like real people.

1155
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,720
So I don't know, dark soccer is giving me that look like she's judging me and I don't

1156
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,720
like it.

1157
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,080
Are you judging me?

1158
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
Dark soccer.

1159
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
I'm judging you.

1160
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,240
Haven't you played Facebook games?

1161
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
There's gotta be a face.

1162
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,240
I quit a lot of my Facebook games, but you have in the past played that stupid final

1163
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,240
fantasy one.

1164
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,280
I was going to say there was the fun nights of the clicky nights of the clicky.

1165
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,280
And then I was like, what the fuck am I doing?

1166
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,280
Oh yeah.

1167
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,280
And I played some social.

1168
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,280
Oh God.

1169
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:24,080
And I got really tired of block.

1170
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,760
They just, they try too much to, a lot of those Facebook games try way too hard to get

1171
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,120
your money.

1172
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,680
Like they need, if they wanted to be smart, they would actually look at, um, like tiny

1173
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,840
tower I think is a lot more subtle about it.

1174
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,720
You know, certainly it's there and they're not shy about it, but you know, it's not like

1175
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,360
in your face all the fricking time.

1176
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,160
So it's just, plus the game show games that I play kind of do that too.

1177
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,680
I play who wants to be a millionaire as well.

1178
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,360
And it's like, you are out of shows.

1179
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,860
Do you want to buy more shows for the day?

1180
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,840
But I don't need to play more than once a day.

1181
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,680
I don't, I don't know, but that's just me.

1182
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,880
So it would be interesting though, if like full on streaming games, more powerful stuff

1183
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,040
was coming to Facebook, like, cause some of the, you know, especially games like who wants

1184
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,120
to be a millionaire and press your luck and the stuff I'm playing don't really have that

1185
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,200
great animations and Sims social for like the week I was playing it before I blocked

1186
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,200
it.

1187
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,800
You know, the animation's kind of old, but imagine if they could have a game like Sims

1188
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:28,000
social with Sims three graphical quality to it that actually ran pretty smoothly.

1189
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,600
Gaikai could bring that, couldn't it maybe.

1190
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,920
I mean, I know we're talking about streaming, I don't know, Arkham city and things that

1191
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,360
are already out there on the PC and stuff, but couldn't Facebook games be developed with

1192
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,360
this in mind.

1193
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,240
So that's very interesting.

1194
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,080
So anyhow, well, anything is possible.

1195
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,080
That's true.

1196
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,080
All right, moving on.

1197
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:54,280
Well, coral, um, X-Box live arcade found what the filter is.

1198
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
Okay.

1199
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,240
Well, coral is one of those, you know, word games.

1200
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:05,800
And uh, if you play it with the parental, uh, filters on, there are a bunch of words

1201
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,780
that you can't play on the list.

1202
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:18,040
There's help train, start dice and God, of course, balls and shaft are not allowed.

1203
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,840
Um, and then the offensive words are not allowed.

1204
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,000
Like arse, shit, fuck, cock.

1205
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,360
But now I heard that see you next Tuesday was allowed somehow was slipping through.

1206
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:42,440
Whereas all these other words are blocked, the mother of all curse words is not the source,

1207
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:48,400
literally the source of all your cursing.

1208
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,720
You can say it, you know, I actually don't like that word, but it is a funny word.

1209
01:01:53,720 --> 01:02:04,120
What kind of, um, there's, um, basically the other, uh, words that, uh,

1210
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,480
Well, I can't understand what the problem is.

1211
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,200
Other words that aren't allowed are skid and poop and bung and hung and dice.

1212
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,080
Oh, great.

1213
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:20,680
Now it's sounding like extra first back on the show, bleached asshole.

1214
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,400
I was going to suggest that to him for that little issue he posted about.

1215
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Okay.

1216
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,560
So shut up.

1217
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,880
Aren't there some actual, like, so there's some words that are blocked that are like

1218
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,360
very dictionary words.

1219
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,160
Like why are these hope help, Oh, help.

1220
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,200
I thought you said hope was hung.

1221
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:41,280
So if I want to, if I want to talk about Oscar movies, I cannot talk about the help because

1222
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,280
it will be blocked.

1223
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,020
You also can't talk, talk about the picture you hung, huh?

1224
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,040
You can't talk about having to poop.

1225
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:56,360
You can't start anything, but yet you can't roll the dice.

1226
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Gamers are beat.

1227
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:02,320
They're, they are discriminating against tabletop gamers because they don't let dice.

1228
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
I'm offended.

1229
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,200
They, they are, they are discriminating against my people.

1230
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,840
But here, this is the, okay.

1231
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,640
To me, this is the hilarious thing about this story and trains.

1232
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,840
So we find, Hey, my dad was a conductor for the railroad.

1233
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
That's offensive.

1234
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
That is offensive.

1235
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,320
You can't say train on X was ever came.

1236
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:24,480
But yet, yeah, here's the, this is the hilarious thing to me is that Microsoft bans all these

1237
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,000
words for whatever reason, like maybe, I don't know, whatever.

1238
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
They're banned.

1239
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,600
Listen, the Xbox 360 does not start.

1240
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:40,040
All I have to, all I have to do is turn on my headset and all I'll hear on Xbox live

1241
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,360
while I'm probably playing coral.

1242
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,080
Nice word, fag.

1243
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,080
This game is gay.

1244
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,700
Why are you playing this faggy gay game?

1245
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,960
Because I saw the game blowing some guy in the back.

1246
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,840
Well, you're playing this game too, so nice little fag better words.

1247
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,600
It says the quote from go there.

1248
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,900
The quote from Gary Penn with Denki, the developer, it says a coral uses the Collins official

1249
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,480
Scrabble dictionary comprising over 110,000 words, up to eight letters in length, including

1250
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,080
a huge collection of words deemed offensive.

1251
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:21,920
So we're talking about like just regularly used words, you know, like how was trained

1252
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,000
offensive?

1253
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,880
It's a really shitty band.

1254
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,320
It's a really shitty band.

1255
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,440
Unless you're, you know, maybe it's a sex move or something.

1256
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,880
The train.

1257
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,880
It's a move in fisting.

1258
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,840
You don't know what a train is?

1259
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,880
Rob's looking it up too.

1260
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,180
You're talking about the human centipede stuff, aren't you?

1261
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,820
My friend just bought that movie.

1262
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,720
She loves that movie.

1263
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,720
Something to that effect.

1264
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,720
Yes.

1265
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,600
A train is something to that effect.

1266
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,600
Okay.

1267
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,640
Except maybe not sewing someone's ass to their face.

1268
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,640
It's yeah.

1269
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,640
Oh, this.

1270
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,160
Oh my God.

1271
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:07,240
Microsoft has forced dance central to remove one of their songs.

1272
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,640
I can't believe it.

1273
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,320
This, this song is deemed way too offensive.

1274
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:20,640
That's not like she fucking said train.

1275
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:28,400
You know, that's, that's a euphemism for big fat cock.

1276
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,880
She says, listen, she's all come on, ride the big fat cock.

1277
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
Lord.

1278
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,440
I see.

1279
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,040
I was thinking it was, you know, maybe a euphemism for fisting.

1280
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:53,960
Rob just turned driving sex with Muppets.

1281
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,800
Gosh.

1282
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,520
Okay.

1283
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,040
Allow me to enlighten you to what a train is.

1284
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,840
I will refer to the official source of all sorts of things like this.

1285
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,840
The urban dictionary.

1286
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,840
Urban dictionary.

1287
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,840
I knew it.

1288
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,880
A group of guys stand in line outside of a room one by one and they enter a room to have

1289
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,520
sex with one girl inside.

1290
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,000
The line must have at least seven guys to be qualified as a train.

1291
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
That is a train.

1292
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,280
Does that make her the caboose?

1293
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:32,400
Well now we understand why the game has banned the word train orange on radio.

1294
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Got that word ban.

1295
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,400
Thank you very much.

1296
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
All right.

1297
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,640
Anyhow, or, or, you know, I'm leaving the room.

1298
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,920
You guys are dirty or it would be a line of men having intercourse connected by penis

1299
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:48,800
to ass.

1300
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:57,080
The conductor or man in the back controls, the conductor or man in the back controls

1301
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,880
the speed while the front controls the direction of the train.

1302
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,800
As one ejaculates, he will then exit the train.

1303
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,320
We involve train sound.

1304
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,320
Is it, is it, is it kind of like this?

1305
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:17,160
I'm not sure asked to ask what the hell is asked to wrecking for a dream.

1306
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,760
Oh, it's the ass.

1307
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
All right.

1308
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,760
Anyways.

1309
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,760
Thank you.

1310
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,760
Urban dictionary.

1311
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,760
Welcome.

1312
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,760
All right.

1313
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,760
I like how I said you're welcome as if I'm urban dictionary.

1314
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,840
All right, let's move on.

1315
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:33,720
Let's stop being 12 and move on to, um, travel around the world and check out what the trains

1316
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,720
bring into a game store near you as we look at some release dates.

1317
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,200
Lots of good stuff this week, actually, uh, the only releases for this month, um, that

1318
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,360
are worth picking up Final Fantasy 13-2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1319
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,260
Also in a collector's edition.

1320
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:55,960
If you want to buy the game with the collector's edition stuff, uh, Soul Calibur 5 on PlayStation

1321
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,000
3 and Xbox 360 also available in a collector's edition as well.

1322
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,240
And Never Dead on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which looks like a more action-packed, slightly

1323
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,680
less strange Shadows of the Dead.

1324
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,780
And then, um, and that's actually it.

1325
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:15,780
And then, uh, nothing.

1326
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,880
There you go.

1327
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,120
I thought we might have had, there was, I think, uh, at one point there was, uh, Pro

1328
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,520
Evolution Soccer 2012 3D for the 3DS, but that's been delayed again.

1329
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,520
I see.

1330
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,920
3D balls were considered offensive.

1331
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:34,520
Uh, it took extra time to render the balls, you know, they had to pay special attention

1332
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,520
to the balls.

1333
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,520
Yeah, that's right.

1334
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
Yep.

1335
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,520
I know.

1336
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,520
Or else somebody might get offended.

1337
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,520
All right.

1338
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,520
Moving on.

1339
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,520
Let's check out what's coming out in Japan.

1340
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,520
We'll start with the Xbox 360.

1341
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,680
Japan finally gets Dragon Age 2.

1342
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,720
So you can say meh, just like the rest of us.

1343
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,880
On February 2nd, 2012 is when Dragon Age 2 finally gets to Japan.

1344
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,420
Also coming to Japan on February 2nd, Never Dead and Soul Calibur 5 obviously is released

1345
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,580
here this week and it looks like it's timed pretty well to actually be released in Japan

1346
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,160
at the same time.

1347
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,920
Coming to the PlayStation 3, um, a lot of the same stuff, Dragon Age 2, Never Dead,

1348
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,920
Soul Calibur 5, but you also get Gran Turismo 5 Spec 2012.

1349
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,160
Uh, I'm not sure exactly what this is, but I want to say this is probably similar, I

1350
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,040
think you were talking about this in the show, Loki, they were going to put out like a Gran

1351
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,520
Turismo 5 that came with a bunch of download content, like a good...

1352
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,560
It came with $20 worth of download content and the Spec 2012 update.

1353
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,600
They are saying that this new update does the simplified cockpit view.

1354
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,600
So I guess that's all.

1355
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,320
It's the Spec 2012 update, they were just calling something different in there.

1356
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,320
Alright, got it.

1357
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,320
So that's what Japan is getting.

1358
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,120
Spec 2.0 is what they're calling it.

1359
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,880
So Japan gets that, hooray.

1360
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,480
The Vita is out in Japan and out this week on the Vita is Ragnarok Odyssey.

1361
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:48,720
Comes out from Gung-Ho and I believe, if I'm not mistaken, this is the Ragnarok Online

1362
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,640
game on the Vita, I think.

1363
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:56,600
Although, I don't know if it's like specific, oh no, I think this is different.

1364
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,120
Ragnarok Odyssey pits gamers against giants from Norse myths, so I don't think that's

1365
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,680
it, but it's like more of an action game.

1366
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:12,720
I saw the name and I thought maybe, maybe, alright, anyhow, um, let's see, uh, coming

1367
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,680
out on other systems.

1368
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,320
Like a train.

1369
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,600
That's just never gonna die.

1370
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,080
I'm trying to see if anything's coming out on the Wii.

1371
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,020
It's coming out.

1372
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:32,080
On the 3DS, Fishing 3D from D3, ooh, Fishing 3D.

1373
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,080
It's almost like the real thing, just as boring.

1374
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,720
And lastly, that's it.

1375
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,120
I guess I could check the PSP real quick.

1376
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,120
How about it?

1377
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,120
Photokano.

1378
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,120
Okay.

1379
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:49,800
On the 30th, in the UK, January 30th, we have Call of Cthulhu, The Wasted Land.

1380
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,920
Call of Cthulhu.

1381
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,560
And now I have to go to February because this thing's set up really bizarre.

1382
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:03,680
And in February, on the 1st, we have Rhythm Party, ooh, on the 2nd, we have Pixel Junk

1383
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:12,760
Eden, and on the 3rd, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, Never Dead,

1384
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,520
and Soulcalibur V.

1385
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,120
Shane knows a lot about the Vita and what's going on and says that Ragnarok Odyssey is

1386
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,760
partially the people that did Ragnarok Online.

1387
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:28,160
So it's not Ragnarok Online, but it's like them, a lot of the same people making a new

1388
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
thing.

1389
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,160
Aye.

1390
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,160
So there you go.

1391
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,160
Just thought you wanna know.

1392
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,800
Alright, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna get into the classic game

1393
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,800
of the week.

1394
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,840
So let's go to Loki.

1395
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:44,280
It's like Ragnarok Wi-Fi ad hoc.

1396
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,680
Yes, it's just like that.

1397
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,080
With a 3G connection provided by AT&T, yes.

1398
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,400
Yes, well in Japan it would be something else.

1399
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:00,400
So yeah, the Vita's getting hacked, as usual.

1400
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,240
But it's not exactly the Vita getting hacked, it's more of the Playstation 3 getting hacked

1401
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,960
and the Vita kind of benefiting from said hack.

1402
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:13,160
Of course with the power of custom firmwares on the Playstation 3, and this has been something

1403
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:18,520
that they did with the PSP before where they added more games supported through remote

1404
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,080
play, they have done the same with the Vita.

1405
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:28,440
Now you can support more games via remote play on the Vita, including Batman Arkham

1406
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:34,200
Asylum, Battlefield 3, Alice in Madness Returns, Mortal Kombat, and Red Dead Redemption.

1407
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,600
However, the games display a hefty amount of input lag.

1408
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:46,360
Also, they had some extra games that they're gonna be supporting via remote play, including

1409
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:56,040
Killzone 3, but those are not yet supported.

1410
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,240
But it looks like, if I remember correctly, with the PSP there were a lot of games that

1411
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:05,560
didn't have remote play enabled, but with hacks were able to get remote play enabled

1412
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,100
on those, and they actually worked just fine.

1413
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:16,080
So there may be more games beyond just those five that they will work and work well.

1414
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,080
So they have videos online too if you wanna check them out.

1415
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:25,160
I mean, I think it'd be pretty awesome to play Battlefield 3 on the Vita or Red Dead.

1416
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:30,360
I didn't even think about that the PSP and the PlayStation 3 already have similar connectivity,

1417
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,120
you know, and it's one of the most underlooked features in the PSP, so the Vita ought to

1418
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:38,080
kick it up, and you should be able to play, like, PS3 games streaming, right?

1419
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,880
Yes, and especially since the controls will be nice instead of having to worry about before

1420
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,600
where, oh, I only have one analog stick, you know, and now you have dual analog, and to

1421
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:52,880
be honest, I mean, they should be supporting, you know, the L2R2 just by tapping a portion

1422
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,840
of the back touch panel, and then you have pretty much full compatibility with, you know,

1423
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:05,240
the DualShock controls, so assuming that you're not gonna run to input lag that's gonna really

1424
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,320
affect your game, I don't see why more games aren't supporting this.

1425
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:14,880
All right, well, I'm hoping to see more of this kind of technology coming to the Vita,

1426
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,080
because I gotta say, if I could play, like, Final Fantasy XIII-2 on my Vita, like, while

1427
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,480
I'm in bed, like, you know, just do a little bit of the, do a little bit of the grinding

1428
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,960
in my bedroom.

1429
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,160
I'm in experience grinding, you sick perv, stop laughing over there, DarkSakura.

1430
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,400
You certainly are experienced, huh?

1431
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Bitch.

1432
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,400
All right.

1433
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,200
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.

1434
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,840
I would, I would love to do that, like, that would be so awesome, like, it's almost like

1435
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,160
a, I mean, what, isn't the Wii U's whole point kind of moot if the PlayStation can do that

1436
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,160
same thing?

1437
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,160
Sort of.

1438
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,720
Sort of, except for the fact that it'll be a way more expensive on the PlayStation 3,

1439
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,720
I'm sure.

1440
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,720
But it's just, I don't know.

1441
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,680
AlphaCananagram wants to make a good point, though.

1442
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:03,680
The thing is, PS3 is Wi-Fi G, not Wi-Fi N, so it's gonna suck.

1443
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:10,200
Yes, but at the same time, you know, who's to say the next system's not gonna be, I'd

1444
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,080
assume the next system's gonna be Wi-Fi N.

1445
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,000
Are you already thinking about Vita II?

1446
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
No, I'm talking about the, um...

1447
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,200
Oh, oh, the, oh, I'm sorry, the PS3.

1448
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
Oh, that's a good point.

1449
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,080
I don't know if the Vita is N. I think it might be.

1450
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,080
It just occurred to me.

1451
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,080
Might be G.

1452
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:29,600
There's another game that I played today, but we're bringing it up.

1453
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,480
I played with the Sony tablet.

1454
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,480
Oh?

1455
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,960
Um, the, what's it called, the tablet S, and it has PlayStation games on it, but I was

1456
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,880
playing the Uncharted pinball game today.

1457
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,880
Oh.

1458
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:47,720
But it was, I was thinking about that, you know, if they've got PlayStation, um, I think

1459
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:55,160
it said some PS2 games, too, on, um, on their little tablet, then it actually seems to,

1460
01:15:55,160 --> 01:16:00,680
you know, that it wouldn't be that hard for them to have the Vita that played, you know,

1461
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,800
your PS3 games.

1462
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,800
AlphaCananagram has another great suggestion here.

1463
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:10,500
They need to release an updated PS3 or some sort of dongle to upgrade the Wi-Fi N, for

1464
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:16,280
the Vita's Wi-Fi N. And dongle, who, he's changed his name, is confirming the Vita does

1465
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,840
have an N in it.

1466
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:26,400
To be honest, you could do that with a Wi-Fi N bridge, um, you could, you know, upgrade

1467
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:32,360
your connection or, you know, have a router that's Wi-Fi N that you connect, you know,

1468
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,680
physically to your PS3 and then have it stream from there.

1469
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:40,120
But yeah, I mean, next system, you know, obviously gonna be N, probably will be able to support

1470
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,800
a lot more streaming, especially if you're gonna be downloading games and stuff, and

1471
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,320
I mean, that could be kinda cool.

1472
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,720
You could see a lot of new functionality with the Vita with that, um, although by the time

1473
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:54,200
that that system comes out, the Vita could be dead in the water already, so, let's hope

1474
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,200
not.

1475
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:02,760
Alright, well, let's move on to another story here I have on THQ, of course, the makers

1476
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,880
of Saints Row, right?

1477
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,280
Uh, apparently it's gonna be refocusing a bit over THQ.

1478
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,080
First, I should say this, there were some crazy-ass rumors this week that THQ was, like,

1479
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,760
gonna just fuckin' fold.

1480
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,760
Like, right?

1481
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,440
Weren't they going around Twitter like THQ is just done, they're waiting, they're gonna

1482
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,440
get bought.

1483
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,880
That was like a couple weeks ago that they were, like, gonna stop.

1484
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,320
Oh, we haven't been here for a couple weeks.

1485
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,880
Well, they had canceled their 2014 portfolio.

1486
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,040
Oh yeah, they canceled their entire 2014 lineup, yes, I remember now.

1487
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:32,960
Well, here's what happened is that what's actually happening is that THQ is going to

1488
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:38,760
renew its focus to be on core game franchises and not traditional kids licensed video games.

1489
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,520
Sorry, guys, no more SpongeBob SquarePants.

1490
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,720
And somebody else will pick up the license, I'm sure.

1491
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:50,760
But anyway, um, UFC, Darksiders, Company of Heroes, Insane, Saints Row, Warhammer 40k,

1492
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,640
and so on, these are all still in production and there will be that going forward.

1493
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,760
They have a ton of fuckin' titles coming out.

1494
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,620
I mean, I'm not surprised that they're, I mean, look at the titles that are coming out

1495
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,620
from THQ.

1496
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:05,000
They have the fuckin' South Park RPG game that's coming out at the end of the year.

1497
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,080
I mean, they've got plenty of big titles.

1498
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,200
I mean, they're on par with, like, EA and, you know, Activision, I mean, they're easily

1499
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,120
one of the top three.

1500
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,800
I mean, hell, even First Party can't really top, you know, I mean, First Party doesn't

1501
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,720
have a lot of titles coming out anymore, but yeah, they're not going anywhere.

1502
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,560
I mean, if you're gonna see another company die, it's gonna be, like, Konami or, you know,

1503
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:34,400
maybe even, like, Capcom, one of the smaller guys, like, D3, you know, I can see them folding.

1504
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,200
South Peak, they could have very well already folded.

1505
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,400
Yeah, it's gonna be one of those.

1506
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,400
It's not gonna be THQ.

1507
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,520
They're not gonna just all of a sudden get bought out.

1508
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,400
They have a ton of properties.

1509
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:50,160
Well, one thing that didn't work out so well for them was the U-Draw tablet, and I think

1510
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:54,560
that's part of what's probably not going to be so much coming out of THQ in the future.

1511
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,800
Hey, did you remember the Ubisoft tablet that they had?

1512
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,800
No.

1513
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,400
Yeah, that's, nobody did either.

1514
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,720
That came out around Christmas.

1515
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:07,880
Um, what, I thought one of those tablets did quite well.

1516
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,880
Was that the first?

1517
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,200
It was the first U-Draw on the Wii.

1518
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,320
But then when they tried to kind of put it everywhere, it didn't do so well, right?

1519
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,320
And I don't really know if it did well, it did alright, but I'm glad that's gone, because

1520
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,920
it was, it had potential, but what, the problem with that tablet is you didn't have anybody

1521
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,680
coming on, like, they were saying, oh yeah, Nintendo's gonna develop some titles for the

1522
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,680
U-Draw tablet.

1523
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,020
If they had done that, then yeah, it would have kicked ass on the Wii, but since there

1524
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:38,760
wasn't a Mario Paint or anything like that on the U-Draw, it just died, you know, no

1525
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,760
one cares.

1526
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,360
Because it's a peripheral that's going to be used for a couple of games, and that's

1527
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,360
it.

1528
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:50,200
Alright, well, let's take a minute to go down memory lane, and think about a time when we

1529
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,720
weren't so worried about games' financial situations, we didn't have these tablet things

1530
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:00,880
that were coming out and destroying game companies, it's the classic game of the week.

1531
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,040
Dark Soccer is going to dive head first into the classic gaming vault and find a game that

1532
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,480
she says, hey, you kids, better respect.

1533
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,640
And you picked a real oldie but goodie tonight, didn't you?

1534
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,160
I picked one of my favorite old games.

1535
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,840
Alright, and you think, how many episodes have you done the classic game of the week

1536
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,840
now?

1537
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,840
It started episode 250, right?

1538
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,520
So damn near 200 classic games of the week.

1539
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,520
Yeah.

1540
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,080
And you're still finding ones you kind of forgot, or whatever, just never did before.

1541
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:36,480
Well, and actually this game last night from Dan and I, we were watching this, like, series

1542
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,000
of Colecovision games.

1543
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,280
So I had to go back to the Colecovision with something that I grew up with.

1544
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,280
So I picked Mousetrap.

1545
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,280
Mousetrap.

1546
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,440
Now tell me if you remember this gaming company, Exedy.

1547
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,720
You know what Exedy stands for?

1548
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,360
I didn't know it stood for anything.

1549
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,320
Is the portmanteau of excellence in dynamics.

1550
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,720
I didn't know that.

1551
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,680
I remember the name Exedy, though.

1552
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,680
Yeah.

1553
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,200
So maybe it's Exedy, since it's dynamics.

1554
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:08,080
Anyway, Mousetrap was basically, I don't know what everyone's going to say, it was a Pac-Man

1555
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,080
clone.

1556
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:16,920
Well, unlike Zynga, Exedy decided to actually innovate on the genre and throw in a few other

1557
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,600
twists.

1558
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:25,160
With Mousetrap, and the one that I linked, and if you will share that with Rama, I shared

1559
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,880
the Colecovision version because that's the one that I grew up with.

1560
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:34,720
Although it was in the arcade, it was a pretty good game, the Atari version is shit.

1561
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,560
So moving forward, you've got these, you play as a mouse and you're being chased by cats

1562
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:45,920
and you are eating up little pieces of cheese and you can collect bones.

1563
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,840
Now the bones, as opposed to how the power pills work, you store up your bones and you

1564
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,600
activate them at a certain time that you choose.

1565
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,320
You can save all of your bones and not use them in that level.

1566
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,760
I mean, you don't, you have to start over the next level, but still, you know, you don't

1567
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,200
have to use all your bones.

1568
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,860
But with, you have the bones, you turn into a dog and the dog, you know, bites the cats

1569
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:10,160
and sends the cats back into their little places that aren't in the center of the screen,

1570
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:14,800
they are on the, uh, each side of the screen.

1571
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,560
In the center, you have a little area that says in, and when you go through the in, it

1572
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,280
actually puts you into one of the four corners at random, you don't get to control.

1573
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:29,440
Actually, I think there was a way to determine which one, but I think it had, depending on

1574
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,880
how you entered the little thing.

1575
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:38,640
So, um, you, uh, actually, instead of there being four enemies on screen, you had six

1576
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,640
cats.

1577
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:45,320
And they, uh, had point multipliers, 100 for the first, 300 for the second, 500 for

1578
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:52,000
the third, 700, 900, and that was it.

1579
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,040
And of course, it resets every time you use a new bone.

1580
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,440
Um, now, the cats, though, will respawn faster.

1581
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:04,360
As you got through later levels, you also had a hawk that would pop up that would, uh,

1582
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:09,580
eat both the mouse and the dog, if you were the dog, and you, um, the only way to get,

1583
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:14,080
to change its direction from going right after you, was to go in the infield in the center

1584
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,020
so that it would just go to a random place.

1585
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:22,560
You also had, uh, bonus, um, items that, when you got one, a next one would appear, and

1586
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,880
your bonus items, they would also be towards the different corners.

1587
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:30,920
Uh, there are a thousand points each and would increase by 200 points for each subsequent

1588
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,720
ply, so the last one was 7,200 points.

1589
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:38,280
The items are, there's 32 of them, there's a wedge of swiss cheese, a paperclip, a safety

1590
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,760
pin, a key, an apple, a trophy, a candlestick, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, a pair

1591
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,560
of eyeglasses, a clock, a bottle, a gem, a bugle, a screw, a hammer, a diamond ring,

1592
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:52,040
a lightbulb, a sewing needle, a fork, a thimble, a knife, a cocktail glass, a fishbone, a pear,

1593
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:59,040
a peanut, a dye, a telephone handset, a dye with C-A-F on the faces, I guess that would

1594
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,640
be like a block, a spool of thread, a teacup, and a pistol, what a mouse needs a pistol

1595
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,800
for, and a martini glass, and eyeglasses, I have no freaking clue.

1596
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,500
Some of the 80s games had the strangest power-ups in them, though, you know.

1597
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:18,580
You also get a 10,000 point bonus for clearing the board of all cheese, and if you end the

1598
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:23,680
stage as the dog, you will begin the next stage as the dog, which is kind of stupid

1599
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,120
because the cats don't really appear.

1600
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:31,320
Now here is, I think, the really innovative part of the game, are the doors.

1601
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:36,760
And with the doors, you had three different colors, you had a yellow, a red, and a blue

1602
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:41,000
door, that if you pressed that colored button, the door would open and close.

1603
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,960
And my goal, every time I played the damn game, was to trap the cats.

1604
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,440
And I was really good at trapping the cats, because then you trap the cats, you don't

1605
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,680
have to worry about them hunting you down.

1606
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:57,960
You just, you know, you may have to go around another door, but, you know, what's a little

1607
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,200
inconvenience for safety, you know?

1608
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,200
Right.

1609
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:05,120
Now this is not to be confused, as some people are saying in the chat room here, the board

1610
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,640
game, yes, Torment is saying, my mom loved that game, she would set up for hours playing

1611
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,720
Mouse Trap, but there was somebody else that says that before that, Torment didn't just

1612
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:17,680
come out and say that, somebody said, somebody said something about the board game in there.

1613
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,760
The board game is not the same as the arcade game.

1614
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,600
But the board game is awesome in its own way.

1615
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,320
And it had lots of breakable parts, and it really pissed me off.

1616
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,320
Yes.

1617
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:32,240
I could never get the little dude to flip the right way at the end.

1618
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:36,280
So yeah, my thing was always trapping the cats, and then just having free reign of the

1619
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:42,120
board, and, oh, I can take my time, ooh, look at you mousies, I mean, kitty cats trapped

1620
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,120
in the little areas.

1621
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,120
So there were different ports.

1622
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:53,320
Like I said, I had the ColecoVision version, which to me was the most true version, I think.

1623
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:58,480
It had fewer prizes, and you could actually have an option to leave out the hawk, and

1624
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,400
the sound effects were a little different, but as far as, you know, having the doors

1625
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,400
and everything, it was probably the closest to the arcade you could get.

1626
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:15,040
The Intellivision one actually added an audio warning when the cats were entering the maze,

1627
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,480
but the graphics were blockier.

1628
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:23,440
And then the Atari 2600 version, okay, you know how awful Pac-Man looked on the Atari

1629
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,440
2600?

1630
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:30,840
Yeah, I'm looking at the videos now, because I want to say I played this one.

1631
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,120
Similarly hideous.

1632
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,560
And no sound.

1633
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,560
Very quiet.

1634
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,840
Block, block, block, block, block, block.

1635
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:43,340
Actually my friend had this game, we used to play this all the time, but it only had

1636
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,340
the one door.

1637
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:49,400
Yeah, only the one color door, and it flickers instead of really opens, it just vanishes.

1638
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,400
Yeah.

1639
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:58,640
So it's not really good, and you had reduced scoring in it, it had no hawk, the in area

1640
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,960
is missing, like from the center, so you didn't have your little teleport boxes.

1641
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,840
You only have three cats instead of six, and all the doors move at the same time.

1642
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,200
So it was really just bastardized.

1643
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:17,560
However, now, you remember the song Pac-Man Fever, Rob?

1644
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,360
Of course I do.

1645
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:25,960
Pac-Man Fever, Bugner and Garcia, well they also did a song called Mouse Trap on the same

1646
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:26,960
album.

1647
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,760
I did not know that.

1648
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,720
It was made using the sound effects from the game.

1649
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,360
A little note on here from the article I'm reading is that when they re-recorded the

1650
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:44,080
album in 1999, they could not find the machine, and so had to use sounds from nature.

1651
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,680
Let's see, I'm actually, I found it here on the good old YouTube that has everything.

1652
01:27:47,680 --> 01:28:05,200
Wow, they do really just sing about the game, don't they?

1653
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:12,440
Well, they do with Pac-Man Fever.

1654
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:16,760
Rest in peace by the way, that guy died last year.

1655
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,320
One of them, there was two of the guys died last year.

1656
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,320
Anyhow.

1657
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:26,200
So that's the game, and again, it was one of my all-time favorites, and my mother would

1658
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,320
sit and play this for hours, although her game was Space Fury.

1659
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,320
Alright.

1660
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,640
Classic Game of the Week, folks, is Mouse Trap for the ColecoVision, or you know, really

1661
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,960
it did start in the arcade, so there it is.

1662
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:42,560
I'm gonna say, if you want to play it at home, without maim, ColecoVision.

1663
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,000
Alright, that's the way to go.

1664
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

1665
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,080
We're gonna be back, there's plenty more of Orange Laundrio to come.

1666
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,080
We have a list list tonight.

1667
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:53,520
We're gonna be doing a list list, tonight's list list is inspired by Twitter.

1668
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,440
There was a listener on Twitter that said you should do this as a topic, and I'm like,

1669
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,440
okay, we can do that.

1670
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:02,180
So we are gonna do a list list, Alan's gonna join us for that here in a little bit, and

1671
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:06,800
we'll get to more of that in part B, and we're gonna talk a little bit about a new pocket

1672
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,760
system that could have Dark Sakura, very excited, we'll see some other Nintendo updates and

1673
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,760
more when we come back.

1674
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:17,160
Your calls and your Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, get those in, and plenty more

1675
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:26,200
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1676
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,080
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1677
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:34,800
We are live on January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.

1678
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,120
You know, if you've never listened to Orange Lounge Radio live, you really should consider

1679
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,120
it sometime.

1680
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:42,280
We are, of course, I do something, I know some of our listeners are overseas, so like

1681
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,920
if you guys are in Europe, it is really hard to listen to our show unless you have severe

1682
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,920
insomnia.

1683
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,320
So I apologize for that, but that is why we have a podcast.

1684
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:53,860
But for those of you guys who are in the States, your excuses are severely numbered.

1685
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:58,720
So we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, of course,

1686
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,220
and we do have the chat room.

1687
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:03,360
And when you're not here with us in live chat, you miss fun things like Dark Sakura's having

1688
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,040
a contest right now.

1689
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,480
Whoever can guess her bra size gets to buy her a taco.

1690
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:15,080
Now, I'm not sure how there's a winner in that situation.

1691
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:19,640
There's two winners and they're both me because everyone gets to know what a fantastic rack

1692
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,640
I have.

1693
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,640
And I also get a taco.

1694
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,640
Can I just put pics on OLR?

1695
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,640
No.

1696
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,640
No.

1697
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:28,320
And then I am kind of wearing a cleavage-y shirt today.

1698
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,320
OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1699
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,800
Actually, I keep saying OLR.com, but that's not our site.

1700
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,080
And my hair is cute.

1701
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,080
You do look cute today.

1702
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,440
I put effort into my hair today.

1703
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:41,400
Considering how, like, shitty I felt, mad you were, I don't know, yeah, angsty you were

1704
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,400
earlier.

1705
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:47,240
A, you've seemed like the show has helped you unwind a little bit, and B, you might

1706
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,520
be in a bad mood, but you're looking good.

1707
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,520
Oh, yeah.

1708
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,520
Yeah.

1709
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,120
Pissy bitch gotta be hot.

1710
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,520
All right.

1711
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,520
All right.

1712
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,880
We're going to do some rapid-fire news.

1713
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,840
Believe it or not, we're not just a video game show about boobies.

1714
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,600
Although, don't get me wrong, everybody loves boobies.

1715
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,600
Loki?

1716
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,600
Boobies?

1717
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,960
He gave the big thumbs up.

1718
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:10,960
Great radio.

1719
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,960
Dark Sakura?

1720
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:12,960
Boobies?

1721
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:13,960
Yeah.

1722
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:14,960
And I love boobies, too.

1723
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,960
Boobies are great.

1724
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:19,960
Oh, is Dark Sakura taking a picture of her boobies?

1725
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,560
I'm just gonna put a picture up.

1726
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,560
Oh, okay.

1727
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,320
That kind of comes with the radio show territory.

1728
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,320
What?

1729
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,320
Taking pictures of boobs.

1730
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:33,320
It's just, you know, you eventually devolve into that type of show.

1731
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,320
Yeah.

1732
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,320
There's the picture.

1733
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,320
See?

1734
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,320
You gotta put that on the site.

1735
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,320
I am.

1736
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,320
All right.

1737
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,320
Moving on.

1738
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,320
All right.

1739
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,320
Let's talk about Skylanders.

1740
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,320
Yay.

1741
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,320
Skylanders.

1742
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:48,320
Your favorite game.

1743
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,320
It's my favorite game.

1744
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,320
What a different type of boob.

1745
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,320
Hey, you know what?

1746
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,320
Here's the thing.

1747
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:57,980
You can't win here if you can't avoid them, then at least benefit from them, but that's

1748
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:58,980
another story.

1749
01:31:58,980 --> 01:31:59,980
Anyways, Skylanders.

1750
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:06,520
So, apparently Activision has grabbed the rights to a domain called Skylanders Giants,

1751
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,640
so you can probably guess that's probably gonna be the next Skylander game or whatever.

1752
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:16,120
So Skylander Giants coming to a store near you.

1753
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,360
You wanna hear something funny?

1754
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:24,920
So as I mentioned weeks prior that those toys are so hard to find right now that they're

1755
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:32,760
going for astronomical prices on auction sites like eBay and Amazon, Activision, cause most

1756
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:38,040
companies eventually they will drop the price of their merchandise.

1757
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,400
Oh no, no, no, no.

1758
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,360
They are raising the price of the merchandise.

1759
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,280
Those toys, remember how they used to cost you like eight bucks or whatever?

1760
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,160
They're gonna cost you one additional dollar to buy that.

1761
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,520
That's like, that'd be like those Call of Duty map packs selling so well that they're

1762
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,280
gonna charge more money for them.

1763
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,280
But guess what?

1764
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,400
You stupid fuckers will keep buying them.

1765
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,960
And so that's why Skylanders Giants is allowed to exist.

1766
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,720
So don't you fucking bitch and complain about your goddamn map packs costing too much because

1767
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:10,200
it's all your fucking fault for buying those stupid Skylander toys.

1768
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,200
Why are you so angry?

1769
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,200
You're so angry.

1770
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,760
Yeah, I'm not fucking angry.

1771
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:18,280
I'll make a quick buck off of those fucking toys.

1772
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,360
So whatever, you know.

1773
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,520
I'm gonna be laughing all the way to the bank.

1774
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,200
Because you people can't get your hands on those toys.

1775
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:36,200
Anyways, Capcom has announced Ace Eternity 5 that's gonna be coming out soon thanks to

1776
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,220
their wonderful logo which is completely in Japanese.

1777
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:43,720
But I do see a five, so I know that it's Ace Eternity 5.

1778
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:49,280
And of course they've offered nothing whatsoever as far as specifics about the game, but eh,

1779
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,280
whatever.

1780
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:57,040
And also there's the Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney series for the 3DS that's been

1781
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:01,400
announced and the game's due out this year.

1782
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:06,040
And also of course they're gonna be doing some HD versions of some of the older Ace

1783
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,040
Attorney games.

1784
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:16,640
One through three are coming to IOS platforms soon with refresh sprites and that fun stuff.

1785
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:21,280
And last but not least, there's a new game coming out on the Playstation 3 for the Move.

1786
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:30,720
And it's gonna allow you to use your Playstation Move controllers to engage in combat.

1787
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:37,960
Looks almost like that Kinect game that they have coming out from the guys that do Crysis

1788
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:38,960
from Crytek.

1789
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:45,160
Very, you know, Roman combat type stuff.

1790
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:51,560
Anyways, the game's called Quandramortis and it's done by the guys that did the fight the

1791
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,560
lights out.

1792
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,640
So they know a little bit about battle games.

1793
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,000
They also know about games that don't sell well.

1794
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,040
So it's hard to say whether that game will do well or not.

1795
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,040
Yeah.

1796
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:07,920
And you'll be able to fight against your friends over the Playstation.

1797
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:14,720
Also if you happen to not want to engage in move combat or multi-move controller combat,

1798
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,880
you can still use a regular controller as well.

1799
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,800
So it's nice to at least have that option in there.

1800
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:21,800
All right.

1801
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,680
Well, moving on to some other rapid fire news.

1802
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:28,900
I think I need a correct musical background for this because it's one of the greatest

1803
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,960
theme songs ever.

1804
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,960
Hopefully it'll work.

1805
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,320
It's the Muppet Show!

1806
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:48,520
Ah, that's right, I played this song because Muppets DLC is coming to LittleBigPlanet 2!

1807
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,520
That's right, Sackboys will meet the Muppets.

1808
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,520
This is going to be so awesome.

1809
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:58,320
Like, I have to admit, I'm so embarrassed because I never really got into LittleBigPlanet

1810
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,320
2.

1811
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,320
Like, I never just bought it because I was like, oh no, there's a stellar game right

1812
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,320
now.

1813
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,320
I can't do it.

1814
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,320
But I love LittleBigPlanet 1.

1815
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,480
So this might seriously push me over the edge right here.

1816
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:11,080
I've got to get LittleBigPlanet 2 because now there's Muppet DLC in it.

1817
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:15,240
It's going to have two new minigames, five new levels, a new soundtrack, objects, voices,

1818
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:19,760
new trophies, twelve new kids, and a Ralph the Dog costume.

1819
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,120
Outstanding.

1820
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:26,600
It's going to cost $5.99 and it actually just came out this week.

1821
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:29,520
Also a new game mechanic is the Attract-O-Gel.

1822
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,140
Now Sackboy can walk on walls and ceilings.

1823
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:37,600
And any object can do the same thanks to the Attract-O-Gel.

1824
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,600
Amazing.

1825
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,080
You know, I haven't played through LittleBigPlanet 2 at all, other than like the first level

1826
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,080
or so.

1827
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,640
I should probably go back.

1828
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:45,640
Oh man.

1829
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:48,960
It's just one of those games that unfortunately just came out at a really bad time, so I kind

1830
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,960
of missed it.

1831
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,320
The first one was so, so good.

1832
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:56,600
I can't imagine how the second one is suddenly bad.

1833
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:01,520
Anyhow, rumors going around, big rumors that Wii U might change their name.

1834
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:07,500
Nintendo is seriously considering renaming the Wii U and it has to do with the fact that,

1835
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,200
I guess a lot of people were confused by the 3DS and the fact that the 3DS and the way

1836
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:16,000
they're kind of selling it looks so similar to the DS that people think the 3DS is just

1837
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,660
a souped up DS, although I'm kind of like, well that's what it is, isn't it?

1838
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,880
But whatever.

1839
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,560
So Nintendo is very scared about this because maybe it's too similar.

1840
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,080
So they're thinking that folks will see Wii U and think it's just the same thing, that

1841
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,840
they already have one at home.

1842
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,440
I don't know how much I'm on board with this, but I don't really care for the name Wii U,

1843
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:43,240
but then again I didn't really like the name Wii and it kind of grew on everybody, so those

1844
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,880
jokes will never get old.

1845
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:49,560
I'm noticing this thread on Destructoid, which is one of the sites that ran the news story,

1846
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:54,260
had some comments for people suggesting a new name and a lot of people are suggesting

1847
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:59,080
a lot of the development names like Ultra, Dolphin, whatever, but I think honestly the

1848
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:04,400
best name I saw in here was Nintendo HD.

1849
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,040
What a great name for the console, just fucking call it what it is.

1850
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,040
It's Nintendo HD.

1851
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,680
I think that's the best suggestion I saw in there.

1852
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:14,280
Loki you look like you're wanting to comment on this or something.

1853
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,800
That sounds fine to me, that makes sense.

1854
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,800
Wii U, do you love the name Wii U?

1855
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,280
Do you hope it sticks?

1856
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:27,580
Well I am very fond of the movie Kung Pao and yes, Wii U does tie into Kung Pao quite

1857
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:33,760
a lot, so I am hoping it sticks just because of all the wonderful Kung Pao clips they get

1858
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:34,760
to watch.

1859
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,760
Wii U, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U.

1860
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,760
Yeah, yeah.

1861
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,740
You should be able to beat him now.

1862
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:45,080
Also Nintendo has announced that at their recent online thing that they do with investors,

1863
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,400
one of the other things they talked about, not just the Nintendo network, but another

1864
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:54,020
little gem slipped in there, a new 2D Mario game that will be released in the next fiscal

1865
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:59,620
year, meaning before March 2013, that will be on the 3DS.

1866
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:03,800
So I know that sounds a little weird because we're talking a 2D game on the 3DS, but think

1867
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:08,440
New Super Mario Brothers Wii, something like that, on the 3DS, which wouldn't surprise

1868
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,940
anybody because that was a huge seller, and that's a game I'm sure they could crank out

1869
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:12,940
no problem.

1870
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:16,400
New Super Mario Brothers Wii wasn't a bad game by any means either.

1871
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,400
It was pretty good.

1872
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,560
Yeah, I already played that on my 3DS, it was called New Super Mario Brothers for the

1873
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:24,280
3DS.

1874
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:29,280
Well there'll probably be a 3D one of those as well that just has slight 3D in it or something.

1875
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,600
But I wouldn't go expecting Mario 3D Land.

1876
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,600
But you know what, who gives a shit, you know what, you don't need to even fucking change

1877
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,600
any of the goddamn game mechanics as long as you make completely all new levels.

1878
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:44,280
No one cares, it's just, it's a Mario game, oh my god.

1879
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,040
Just make really fun levels and done.

1880
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:50,760
You don't need to like, make something brand new every time.

1881
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,960
That's not to say that you shouldn't make brand new things because, you know, they've

1882
01:39:54,960 --> 01:40:02,400
been, you know, they've had the problem with releasing games that they've changed nothing

1883
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:09,960
for like ages on, Animal Crossing, or you know, it's just like any of the new play control

1884
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,960
things.

1885
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,280
I mean, they should change a little bit, but you know, it's not to say that the old stuff

1886
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,040
wasn't good.

1887
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:22,920
Some comments on our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, Rama says, no, just call it Nintendo.

1888
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,960
The Nintendo, Nintendo.

1889
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,380
You know, that's been suggested a lot, and that was even rumored, one of the titles at

1890
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:34,360
one point, but the NES was the Nintendo, and I think, I don't know, I just, I like Nintendo

1891
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:40,520
HD or Wii HD, just something, I like to keep it simple, but that might be too simple.

1892
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:44,520
Call it the Nintendo money press because it prints money.

1893
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,560
Some other comments on our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, Dongle says, give me true Super Mario World

1894
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:52,600
sequel with 2D art in 3D.

1895
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,560
AhMyEye says, I want a good Yoshi's Island sequel.

1896
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:01,840
Well, yeah, Super Mario Bros. 2 Yoshi's Island, that was one of the best.

1897
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,840
Weeee, weeee, weeee, weeee.

1898
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,840
No, thank you.

1899
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:05,840
All right.

1900
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,400
Anyhow, let's move on, DarkSakura.

1901
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,120
Well, we do have a few other things.

1902
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:16,360
It would also be good if I did not have the mailbag pulled up over it.

1903
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:20,800
So how about Street Fighter X Tekken?

1904
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:29,600
There's some interesting news, and that is a weird picture of Mega Man.

1905
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,840
It's Mr. Mega Man.

1906
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,840
Mr. Mega Man?

1907
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,920
Well, it's technically Mega Man.

1908
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:42,640
He's in the pose from the American box art for the first Mega Man, and that's just weird.

1909
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:46,600
Also, the image of his showing, so I can link it in the chatroom, so.

1910
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:52,080
But it was, yeah, bizarre.

1911
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,520
And also Pac-Man's in it, which I don't get.

1912
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,240
Well, the Pac-Man thing was cool.

1913
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,040
Have you seen the trailer with him in action yet?

1914
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,040
No.

1915
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,040
Because it's, okay.

1916
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,200
Pac-Man, this is worth, yeah, because this is the weird thing.

1917
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,840
Like, Pac-Man sounds stupid to me, but wait until you see what they did to Pac-Man.

1918
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,680
You're gonna say the same thing I did, I bet.

1919
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,520
Well, it said with mechanical assistance.

1920
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,640
Well, it's a very specific mechanical.

1921
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,640
It's Pac-Man.

1922
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,560
Let her see, because she's a Tekken fan.

1923
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,160
Don't spoil it!

1924
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,520
Or I will throw a cartoon Megan Fox at you.

1925
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,520
All right, let's see.

1926
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,520
Ah, here it is.

1927
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,160
Okay, let's, uh, I hope this isn't some stupid-ass parody or something.

1928
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,720
Let's see here.

1929
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,160
No!

1930
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,160
I hate YouTube advertisements.

1931
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,160
Damn it.

1932
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,160
Damn it.

1933
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,160
Damn it.

1934
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:37,160
All right, hold on.

1935
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,160
We gotta...

1936
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:39,160
It's some dude proposing to some chick.

1937
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,160
No, no, no, no.

1938
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:41,160
She's not gonna marry you.

1939
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,160
What?

1940
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,160
What were you saying?

1941
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:44,160
It's a stupid commercial.

1942
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:47,520
Oh, we're not gonna watch the stupid commercial.

1943
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,760
We had to get through it.

1944
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,760
We had to get through it.

1945
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,760
Here we go.

1946
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:51,760
Warning.

1947
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:52,760
The following trailer may...

1948
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,760
God damn it!

1949
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,760
It's just some...

1950
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,760
Ah, I see a lot of warnings.

1951
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,760
I don't think that was...

1952
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:01,400
I hate when people take the videos and...

1953
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:02,400
There we go.

1954
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,400
That was just on it, Rob.

1955
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,400
Oh.

1956
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,400
Ah, you ruined it.

1957
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,400
Sorry, I closed it.

1958
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,400
Hold on.

1959
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,400
Let me do one more.

1960
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,400
This is great, great radio.

1961
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,400
Let's try this one.

1962
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,400
Geez, Rob.

1963
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,400
That's a website I know.

1964
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,400
So this ought to be something I can trust.

1965
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,400
I like machinima.

1966
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,400
Come on.

1967
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,400
Play the trailer.

1968
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,400
Here we go.

1969
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,400
Crude humor.

1970
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:25,400
That's like this show with its trains.

1971
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:38,240
I love the cat.

1972
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,240
So Mega Man looks terrible.

1973
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,240
The fuck is that?

1974
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:49,480
Oh, he's in the Tetsujin outfit.

1975
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,480
That is cool.

1976
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:51,480
Okay, cool's okay.

1977
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:55,480
Cool makes sense.

1978
01:43:55,480 --> 01:44:03,880
Yay, Kuro and Toto.

1979
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:10,360
That's awful.

1980
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,240
They've got to be just trolling us with that.

1981
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,400
No, that's the real deal.

1982
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,480
It has, um, what's his name's Kenji Nefuni's blessing.

1983
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,120
No, no, no, hold on.

1984
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:21,280
It has his blessing from a year ago.

1985
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:25,520
Prior to the whole Mega Man stuff being canceled prior to him leaving the company.

1986
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:26,520
Yeah.

1987
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,320
He's like, Hey, you wanted to use that in the game?

1988
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,320
Okay.

1989
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:30,320
Yeah, sure.

1990
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,320
That's fine.

1991
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,320
I'm going to work on making Mega Man Legends three.

1992
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,320
Oh, by the way, we're letting you go.

1993
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:38,600
Or it's like, yeah, that, that is the whole, yeah.

1994
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,080
Blessing from a year ago is what he has.

1995
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:44,920
But I mean, now it's just like fans are pissed off that you won't make a mega game.

1996
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:49,200
He won't put Mega Man in Mega Man, you know, ultimate, uh, Marvel vs Capcom three.

1997
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,960
And then you pull this fucking shit.

1998
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,360
You might as well just dressed up Frank West as Mega Man, cause that would be less offensive

1999
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,360
than this.

2000
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:59,200
It's funny watching what's happening because a lot of people are like, like it's really

2001
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:02,840
interesting cause a lot of gamers are looking at this going, not funny.

2002
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,040
This is not funny.

2003
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:05,120
Like gamers.

2004
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,880
I feel like gamers are like actually offended by that.

2005
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,020
Let's let's let's dark soccer.

2006
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:10,520
You just saw it for the first time.

2007
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,640
Are you having that reaction to, it's not funny.

2008
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,200
I feel like I've got to throw up.

2009
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:18,400
I mean, I'm not, I have a headache now.

2010
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:23,320
I started to have a headache earlier and it was going away as I started to feel better,

2011
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:25,840
but now I feel nauseous and my headache has come back.

2012
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,480
Think about Pac-Man as Mokujin, cause that is kind of awesome.

2013
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,480
That's Tetsujin.

2014
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,480
Oh, I thought it was Mokujin.

2015
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,480
It was the metal outfit.

2016
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,480
Oh, okay.

2017
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,480
Tetsujin means iron.

2018
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:34,600
Ah, got it.

2019
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:38,960
Now Moku would, now listen, I mean, now I can speak Japanese.

2020
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,560
Domo Oregato, Mr. Roboto.

2021
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,320
Hey, here's another, another lesson.

2022
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:46,660
Moku Yobi is Wednesday.

2023
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:49,320
No one curry.

2024
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:55,320
I mean, I was just going to say that, uh, doesn't Capcom understand that these fucking

2025
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,720
characters are not part of Street Fighter or Tekken?

2026
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:04,240
I mean, I understand that they want to do like a SNK versus, you know, a Namco versus

2027
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:06,440
Capcom game or something like that.

2028
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:10,360
But there was a Namco cross Capcom game, but it wasn't a fighting game.

2029
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:14,360
Why didn't they just do, you know, instead of Street Fighter cross Tekken, why don't

2030
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,600
they just do Namco cross Capcom, the fighting game?

2031
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,880
Cause that's what this is.

2032
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,480
Like they had the fucking final fight characters.

2033
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,160
They have Cole, which I'm that cool.

2034
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,720
You got your exclusive characters for the PlayStation.

2035
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,680
Cole isn't either one, but okay.

2036
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:28,680
Whatever.

2037
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,720
You know, and, and like Pac-Man stuff, it just doesn't make any sense.

2038
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:35,720
And none for Xbox buy.

2039
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:39,920
The only cool thing about this Pac-Man Pac-Man's adorable.

2040
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:43,200
See right before you watch that trailer, you're like, what the fuck Pac-Man?

2041
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,280
Like that's not going to make sense when you're watching it like, Oh, okay.

2042
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,280
That's right.

2043
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,280
Mega Man.

2044
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,280
What'd they do to Mega Man?

2045
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:51,340
That's like the exact same reaction the rest of the internet had.

2046
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:58,720
He's like, not even, you know, kind of lean and mean looking, but he's, it looks like

2047
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,440
he's been eating too many donuts.

2048
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:02,520
He looks like Mega Man going through a midlife crisis.

2049
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,720
It looks like I put on a Mega Man outfit.

2050
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,720
No.

2051
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,320
Rob, you would look better than that dude.

2052
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,800
Oh, well thank you.

2053
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:09,800
All right.

2054
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:10,800
Next story.

2055
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,800
Yes.

2056
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,280
I know about some Doctor Who news.

2057
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:21,760
There will be a two Doctor Who games that are going to be on the PC, PlayStation three

2058
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:30,280
and actually there's, there were two, there is a Doctor Who, the eternity clock is going

2059
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:40,000
to come out on March, 2012 and it is going to be a, well it has the silence and apparently

2060
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,400
a bunch of the other bad guys who like the Daleks cause you can't have a Doctor Who game

2061
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,780
without the Daleks being all over at exterminate.

2062
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:52,120
So next news, um, we're not having a BlizzCon next year.

2063
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,440
No BlizzCon.

2064
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,720
As in this year?

2065
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,720
This year.

2066
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:56,720
Yeah.

2067
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,560
That means that I won't be able to do disc on like I did last year.

2068
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,840
Oh yeah.

2069
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:09,680
No BlizzCon because apparently they are so busy with Diablo three and the pandas and

2070
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:15,760
the Titan MMO who that they're just not going to do it or they just have nothing to show

2071
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,760
us.

2072
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,760
I mean, let's be real.

2073
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,760
They have nothing to show us.

2074
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:19,760
Everything.

2075
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:20,760
We already know everything.

2076
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,280
Titans not ready to show and you know, whatever the next next expansion is for a while.

2077
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:29,560
They're not going to show this or little pandas, but they didn't have a BlizzCon in 2006 so

2078
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:32,240
folks do need to realize it was never supposed to be an annual event.

2079
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,080
It just kind of worked out that way.

2080
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:39,720
All pandas I'm going to have you realize I have saved the name fatty cakes to make my

2081
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:40,720
Panda.

2082
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:41,720
I know.

2083
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:46,160
What did I call my mud slapper after it was, you don't, we were playing around the, you

2084
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:51,040
don't know Jack and I think it was, is it one of Baskin Robbins 31 flavors or is it

2085
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:56,040
a term for a fart and mud slapper came up and I'm like, I'm going to name my pandar

2086
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,040
in that.

2087
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,040
I almost, that's a fart.

2088
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:04,120
I almost did, um, named, named, uh, named her after my would name my Panda after my

2089
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,120
current druid.

2090
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:06,720
And they made her pond arena.

2091
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,720
Nice.

2092
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,400
All right.

2093
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,000
That's it for rapid fire news.

2094
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,240
I think we've been promising this for some time now.

2095
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:20,680
I think it's time to get into tonight's list list.

2096
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:27,240
Tonight's list list topic is what bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U Xbox lube

2097
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,400
or PlayStation four.

2098
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:33,080
This was inspired by a tweet that was sent to me earlier this week for message J one

2099
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:37,280
hundred, Matt that said the next listless or match game should feature gaming bullshit

2100
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:42,520
rumors because, uh, I was tweeting about the whole ridiculousness of some of the Xbox rumors

2101
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:46,700
that were going around and he suggested that and I said, you know what, consider it done.

2102
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:47,700
So here it is.

2103
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:52,900
What bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U Xbox lube or PlayStation four.

2104
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:55,800
If you have suggestions, you should yell them out in our chat room at chat, that orange

2105
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,520
ready.com because when a host needs an answer, they might consult our chat room and pick

2106
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:00,520
some of our favorites.

2107
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,520
Okay.

2108
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,520
The way to listless works.

2109
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,800
I'll recap for you one time.

2110
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:07,560
Four people are going to participate, so it's going to be us and Alan is in the room.

2111
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:08,560
Hi Alan.

2112
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:09,560
How you doing?

2113
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,560
Good.

2114
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,560
Yay.

2115
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,560
Hi.

2116
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:13,560
What's new.

2117
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,560
Skyrim.

2118
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,560
Okay.

2119
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:16,560
All right.

2120
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,280
So we're all going to go around and name our top three and then we each go around the room

2121
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,280
and take one off of the list.

2122
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,060
That leaves a list of eight.

2123
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:27,500
You guys in our chat room, then vote on the list of eight to pick your number one and

2124
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,500
number two favorites.

2125
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:33,640
And then we have our definitive list of the top three bullshit rumors that will be next

2126
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:37,720
about the Wii U Xbox lube or PlayStation four.

2127
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,720
Okay.

2128
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,320
All right.

2129
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:42,320
So let's start it off.

2130
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:47,440
Um, who wants to start off, uh, dark soccer is going to start up dark soccer in the air

2131
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,500
like I was in school.

2132
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:54,780
Your number three bullshit rumor headset will come out that will send a signal directly

2133
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:58,360
to the brain through a small laser shot toward the optical nerve that will provide an immersive

2134
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:04,080
environment at Andy fork effect, making them easily conquerable by our alien overlords.

2135
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:06,840
So I'm going to shorten that to say board headset.

2136
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:17,960
This the little thing from the Star Trek episode, the game, ah, what console will that be on?

2137
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,920
It's Nintendo.

2138
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,920
It'll be on the wheel.

2139
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:21,920
All right.

2140
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,920
That's a Sony thing.

2141
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,920
Okay.

2142
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,920
Controlling you.

2143
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:26,920
That would be Sony.

2144
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,440
It's always one step closer to the holodeck, right?

2145
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,440
Yes.

2146
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,440
One step closer to the holiday.

2147
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:31,440
All right.

2148
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,440
How about Loki?

2149
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:33,440
Why don't you go next?

2150
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,440
Loki?

2151
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,440
What's your number three answer?

2152
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,800
My number three answer will be that the Xbox lube, uh, to further its immersion with gamers

2153
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:44,840
and stuff will fire, uh, different colored liquids at you, depending on the situation.

2154
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:52,240
Black spray, sweat, pain.

2155
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:58,640
So it will actually, it's going to be liquid vision and it will actually fire shit at you

2156
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,880
and get your living room.

2157
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:09,100
And when you're playing a sex game, it's iridescent and foamy and shows up really well under a

2158
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,100
black light.

2159
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:11,100
All right.

2160
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,740
I'll go next.

2161
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:16,120
My number three answer for next bullshit rumor.

2162
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:22,800
The Xbox lube will introduce a new technology that is 100% hack proof.

2163
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,800
Yay.

2164
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:26,480
See what I did there?

2165
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:27,800
I see what you did there.

2166
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,800
All right.

2167
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,680
So the Xbox lube will be a hundred percent hack proof.

2168
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:38,680
It'd be funnier if it was a hundred percent hack proof by the fact that it's just a solid

2169
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,680
steel block.

2170
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:47,040
Like you have to cut through with like welding material, welding tools to get to the actual

2171
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:51,640
like people, people put it on their entertainment centers and then the entertainment center

2172
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,560
just collapses because it can't hold the weight.

2173
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,760
It's like, ah, don't worry about it.

2174
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,760
It's made out of a mystery material from space.

2175
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:00,760
All right.

2176
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:05,480
So, uh, Alan, what is your number three answer?

2177
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:11,600
Microsoft purchases the mega video brand next Xbox cap streaming Netflix in 72 minutes as

2178
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:15,680
DLC two for XBLA silver.

2179
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,560
How am I supposed to shorten that way?

2180
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,880
They're going to cap Netflix in 72 minutes.

2181
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:25,520
Are you familiar with watching pirate stuff on mega video after 72 minutes, it would say,

2182
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:30,800
we're sorry, you're, you know, you've watched too much, so you have to, and it would piss

2183
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,800
people off.

2184
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:39,360
So LOL, if the Xbox did that in some ways, that's funny.

2185
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:44,600
That's trolling the pirates because it's like, LOL, you got a free movie and then trolled.

2186
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:45,600
You don't get to see the ending.

2187
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:46,600
That's kind of funny.

2188
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:49,160
And what was the other half of that?

2189
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:53,760
Also on for mega download, you have to enter a queue to actually download the episode you

2190
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,760
want.

2191
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,520
And sometimes it would be up to an hour or more.

2192
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,920
So if you're an Xbox silver member, you'd have to wait to buy to get your DLC.

2193
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,920
All right.

2194
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:02,920
There you go.

2195
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,040
Xbox taking some tips from mega video.

2196
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:08,760
All right, let's go to Loki for his number two and I'm sorry, dark soccer was first.

2197
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:11,440
I was going to say, please, I was doing things out of order.

2198
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,440
Dark soccer.

2199
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,440
Your number two answer, please.

2200
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:17,080
The Wii U will actually have a camera and the controller that maps your face to your

2201
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:22,840
me, but it secretly steals your soul and feeds it to Miyamoto.

2202
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:27,780
They advertise it as having a webcam in it, but it steals your soul.

2203
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:30,040
Now what will Miyamoto be doing with those souls?

2204
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:38,880
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, using it to fuel his dark magical powers to make a new Zelda

2205
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:39,880
game.

2206
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:40,880
All right.

2207
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:44,800
Loki, your number two, it'll be Zelda soul force.

2208
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:49,360
Well, I was going to have it be like the Wii U as a VR headset, but that's kind of been

2209
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,360
done before.

2210
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,040
So the Wii U is the controller.

2211
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:54,480
Like the actual console is the controller.

2212
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:59,960
So you better make sure you don't throw it because that might be bad.

2213
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:05,800
Wait, I put Wii U as a console as a controller.

2214
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:06,800
Don't throw it.

2215
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:07,800
Here we go.

2216
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:08,800
It's gotta be funnier.

2217
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:09,800
All right.

2218
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,800
All right, fine.

2219
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,800
Okay.

2220
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:14,640
It's a, it is the controller, but it's shaped like a giant, like number one, you know, foam

2221
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:23,560
glove because they're the number one console.

2222
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:30,760
I like the idea of a big number one foam glove being the next controller.

2223
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,760
All right.

2224
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,840
They're trying to, you know, real in the sports lover demographic.

2225
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:36,640
All right.

2226
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:43,160
My number two answer is that the PlayStation four will actually let you beam yourself into

2227
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:46,200
the grid so you can participate in Tron.

2228
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:51,120
Like IRL reboot and the blind, the show reboot, right?

2229
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,120
Is that what you're talking about?

2230
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,120
That show?

2231
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:55,120
What was that?

2232
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:56,120
Incoming game.

2233
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:57,120
It was a Saturday morning.

2234
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:58,120
Part two.

2235
01:55:58,120 --> 01:55:59,800
It was one of the first police ever.

2236
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,800
They had blue faces.

2237
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:01,800
They were purple.

2238
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,800
They were purple.

2239
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,760
Hold on.

2240
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,760
I'm typing this out.

2241
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,440
PS four will actually let you beam yourself in the grid.

2242
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,440
Okay.

2243
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:18,640
I have a friend that's a really big fan of that show too.

2244
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,440
How many years has that been off the show?

2245
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,440
All right.

2246
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:26,880
So Alan, your number two answer for next bullshit rumor.

2247
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:32,480
Taking a hint from the PS two emotion engine, the PS four will have an empathy engine chip

2248
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:41,800
that actually really does feel the same pain as you when it's $799 price point is revealed.

2249
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:42,800
Womp womp.

2250
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,800
All right.

2251
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:48,480
So the PS four empathy engine actually will feel sorry for Sony when the price point is

2252
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,480
revealed.

2253
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,600
I don't like that PS four empathy engine.

2254
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:52,600
All right.

2255
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,600
Dark Sakura.

2256
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:56,880
It's time for the number one answer is let me, let me recap just so we don't have any

2257
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,880
double heads.

2258
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:58,880
Let me recap.

2259
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,120
Headset from the game for PS four.

2260
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,120
I should put Star Trek.

2261
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:08,640
The game headset from Star Trek, the game for PlayStation four fire different colored

2262
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,640
liquids at you.

2263
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:19,440
What console was that loop of the loop lubricating liquid and fires warming gel in your eye.

2264
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,040
All right.

2265
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,520
Xbox lube is a hundred percent hack group.

2266
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:27,220
Xbox teams up with mega video, which brings caps for Netflix.

2267
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:30,240
The Wii U will steal your soul and feed the Miyamoto.

2268
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:34,440
We use the console is the controller and it comes with a big number one foam glove.

2269
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:39,440
A PS four will actually let you beam yourself into the grid and the PlayStation four has

2270
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:40,440
an empathy engine.

2271
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:44,280
When you hear the $799 price point, it will cry.

2272
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,280
All right.

2273
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,280
Dark Sakura.

2274
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:53,240
I'm going to laugh number one answer for next bullshit rumor for the lube.

2275
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:57,000
Everyone will be issued a skin implant that has what games they've purchased registered

2276
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,840
to their DNA.

2277
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:08,400
That would be the only real way and most importantly, hack proof.

2278
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:12,880
So when you actually go in to give blood samples, they'll be able to see what games you've purchased.

2279
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,360
Ooh, someone's been playing X tango.

2280
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:17,360
Okay.

2281
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,360
Really?

2282
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:19,360
You bought fusion frenzy.

2283
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:23,280
All right, Loki number one answer.

2284
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:27,480
The PlayStation four will be a co-produced by Capcom.

2285
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:33,040
It will arrive in the shape of the bad box art mega man in the position of where he is

2286
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:40,640
teabagging the consumer as a special thanks from Capcom for your wait, the console or

2287
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:41,640
the box.

2288
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:45,240
The actual console will be in the shape of bad box art mega man.

2289
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:52,080
Think of it as a statue, if you will, uh, where he is teabagging the user PS four co-produced

2290
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:56,120
by Capcom console is shaped as mega man teabag.

2291
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:58,920
It's the ultimate insult or the ultimate troll.

2292
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,920
I see.

2293
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:00,920
I see it.

2294
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:01,920
It's all been leading up to this.

2295
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:02,920
Exactly.

2296
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:03,920
All right.

2297
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,920
It's a PlayStation exclusive.

2298
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:08,640
You see my number one answer.

2299
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:18,160
President cat is a launch title for the Wii U as a seller that might sell me the system.

2300
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,480
Hey, it could happen.

2301
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:20,480
All right.

2302
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:24,000
Hey, an insider source told me they're thinking about it.

2303
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,320
Alan, your number one answer.

2304
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:30,120
My ideas kind of fell apart when it came to number three.

2305
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:32,120
So this kind of really is good.

2306
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:38,040
Um, the second gen three DS XL will also double as and work better than the we use controller

2307
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:45,640
tablet from launch comes with a free step of coup blade for early adopters.

2308
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:50,760
So basically the next three years will work with the Wii U and actually be better than

2309
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:55,040
what comes with the new and you can fall on it when you realize how much you paid for

2310
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,040
it.

2311
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,040
Yeah.

2312
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,040
Got it.

2313
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:59,040
All right.

2314
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:00,040
All right guys.

2315
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,040
Here we go.

2316
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,040
Let's see.

2317
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,040
First I got to read off some of the answers from chat here.

2318
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:05,960
I don't know if I see a tiger class says, how about the Wii U introduces a new peripheral

2319
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:10,160
to let you control the dashboard or games, but only using your mind.

2320
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:15,880
Uh, a hum, a hum Kara says Sony and Microsoft secretly joined forces to develop a console

2321
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:19,160
to beat Nintendo since that's the only way that they could win the console battle in

2322
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:24,640
Japan and the worldwide, uh, acidic vampire thinks that in dark soccer's answer about

2323
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:28,200
Miyamoto taking the souls, they'll be transferred to the means.

2324
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,760
Let's see.

2325
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:36,240
Uh, tiger class says the Xbox introduces a perfect, oh wait, I already saw that one.

2326
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:38,680
Um, so we said something about the only play MMOs.

2327
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,680
There you go.

2328
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:42,120
Some of the answers from our chat room.

2329
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,120
All right.

2330
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,120
But we, we, you want to change yours.

2331
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:46,120
Yeah.

2332
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:47,120
Get rid of my third one.

2333
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:49,120
I have a new, I are at my first five, my final one.

2334
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,120
I want to replace it.

2335
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:52,120
Yes.

2336
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:58,600
So it's rumored that the load up a splash screen for the Wii U is actually a memory

2337
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:14,000
erasing pulse so that they can get you to buy a budget of Zelda and Mario.

2338
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,880
So I have the Wii U loading screen erases your memory.

2339
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,800
So you rebuy games all over again.

2340
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:19,800
I like that.

2341
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:22,320
Do I, do I own the super Mario three?

2342
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,320
I can't remember.

2343
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,960
Don't I have Mario three?

2344
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,760
I love Mario three.

2345
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:27,880
All right.

2346
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:30,760
Now's the part where we go around and eliminate items from the list.

2347
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,680
It's very difficult, but it has to be done.

2348
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:34,000
All right.

2349
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,840
Here's the list of stands so far.

2350
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:41,240
Headset from Star Trek, the game for PS4, uh, Xbox lube fire different colored liquids

2351
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,240
at you.

2352
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,000
Xbox lube is a hundred percent hack proof.

2353
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,040
Xbox teams up with mega video caps for Netflix.

2354
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,800
Wii U will steal your soul and feed them to Miyamoto.

2355
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:53,880
We use the console as a controller and it's just a big number one foam glove.

2356
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:57,160
The PlayStation four will actually let you beam yourself into the grid.

2357
02:01:57,160 --> 02:02:01,960
PlayStation four has an empathy engine price of $799 fuel pain.

2358
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:06,960
Xbox lube skin implant, which purchases registered to your DNA.

2359
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,040
The PlayStation four is co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as Mega Man teabagging

2360
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,040
you.

2361
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:16,200
Uh, president cat has a launch title for the Wii U and the Wii U loading screen erases

2362
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:17,200
your memory.

2363
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,360
So you rebuy the games again.

2364
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,640
Unfortunately, the list cannot stay in this shape.

2365
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:26,120
We have to tinker with it a little bit and erase those that are unworthy.

2366
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:29,240
Dark Sakura, which of these is unworthy of the list?

2367
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:32,600
I have to go with the, um, liquid one.

2368
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:35,520
Oh, that's just, that's one of my favorites.

2369
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,960
The Xbox lube firing different colored liquids at you.

2370
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,080
I would love that one, but it is off the list.

2371
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,080
Sorry.

2372
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,160
Chatters low key.

2373
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:45,720
Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

2374
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:46,720
I take off.

2375
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:49,920
It's a hundred percent hack proof because they will make that claim and unfortunately

2376
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,920
it, you know, it's not going to be a hundred percent.

2377
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:53,920
All right.

2378
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:57,040
That is stricken from the list.

2379
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:05,120
Um, I'm thinking, sorry, I don't mean to be quiet.

2380
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:10,720
Um, I'm going to erase.

2381
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,880
I'm going to erase.

2382
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:17,320
I'm sorry, Jamie, the headset from Star Trek, the game for the PlayStation four, it went

2383
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:18,320
over my head.

2384
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,320
All right.

2385
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:22,320
It is off the list.

2386
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,960
Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2387
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,960
Oh boy.

2388
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:40,840
Um, looking, looking, the, uh, president cats, a launch title for the Wii U.

2389
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:46,160
I think you just eliminated the one the entire chat would have voted for, but it is off the

2390
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:47,160
list.

2391
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,160
What?

2392
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:50,160
That's probably the second or third time I've done that on this list.

2393
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:55,560
I'm not rid of the popular fandom one, so I'm just keeping up with my shitty reputation.

2394
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:02,200
All right, Alan keeps his shitty reputation by striking president cat as a launch title

2395
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:05,060
for the Wii U hit is off the list.

2396
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:06,060
So here it is.

2397
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:07,060
Here's the list.

2398
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:10,840
As you can vote for, please send your number one and your number two answers as a private

2399
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:15,400
message to sky in the chat room, S K I E sky in the chat room.

2400
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:17,320
Here is the list as it stands now.

2401
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:20,320
Xbox teams up with mega video and there's caps for Netflix.

2402
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:23,200
The Wii U will steal your soul and feed it to Miyamoto.

2403
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:27,180
The Wii U where the console is the controller and it's a big number one foam glove.

2404
02:04:27,180 --> 02:04:31,840
The PS4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid from Tron PlayStation four empathy

2405
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:35,760
engine that will feel the pain of a $799 price point.

2406
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:40,040
Xbox lube has a skin implant with purchases registered to your DNA.

2407
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:44,560
PlayStation four is co-produced by Capcom and the old school mega man will teabag you.

2408
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,660
A Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you rebuy games.

2409
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:51,240
There is the list as it stands now.

2410
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:56,360
Place your number one and your number two votes in a private message to sky S K I E

2411
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:57,620
in the chat with your vote.

2412
02:04:57,620 --> 02:05:00,960
We will tally them up and have the answers for you shortly.

2413
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,960
In the meantime, let's go to more news from Loki.

2414
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:05,960
Thank you, Alan.

2415
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:07,320
You can stick around for results later.

2416
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:08,320
Yeah.

2417
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:11,900
Just, just tell chat the reason why I deleted the president cat one is because it was more

2418
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:14,840
about a game than the console.

2419
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:17,640
Justify, justify, justify.

2420
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:19,800
All right.

2421
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:20,800
No, it's fine.

2422
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:21,800
All right.

2423
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:22,800
Moving on.

2424
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:28,680
Uh, there's a rumor that SNK may be releasing a new Neo Geo handheld system.

2425
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:34,680
Uh, not necessarily a Neo Geo pocket, but it's currently known as the Neo Geo portable

2426
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,680
device.

2427
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:40,720
Um, and it's a handheld it's, they're saying it's slightly bigger than an iPhone.

2428
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:46,800
It comes with two gigs of storage, uh, plenty of buttons, a 4.3 inch screen, SD card slot,

2429
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,200
headphone jack, and AV out.

2430
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:51,640
It sounds just like a dingo to be honest.

2431
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:53,160
Looks just like a dingo.

2432
02:05:53,160 --> 02:06:00,560
Um, and, uh, they're saying, um, thanks to official SNK licensing, it comes preloaded

2433
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:06,520
with 20 Neo Geo titles, um, North American versions, including metal slug, fatal fairy

2434
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:13,680
specials, and Goku, uh, King of the monsters and a magician Lord, as well as many others.

2435
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:16,160
I have magician Lord already.

2436
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:22,560
And um, let's see, yeah, it sounds neat.

2437
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:31,080
Of course, you know, this is coming from Famicom Plaza and, uh, SNK hasn't really, uh, confirmed

2438
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:35,200
anything yet, but, uh, it looks neat.

2439
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:42,720
We want interesting, as long as the games are cheaper, that's the most important thing.

2440
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:43,720
Oh yeah.

2441
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:44,720
All right.

2442
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:48,080
Moving on with some other, uh, little Nintendo updates going on.

2443
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:53,880
Uh, Nintendo has apparently, um, I guess they're, they're really experiencing some heavy losses

2444
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:57,840
and it's even funny because the story's so much out there that that one, what is that

2445
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:01,380
Asian company that does all the animations that end up on like Conan O'Brien and stuff

2446
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,380
of the news NME?

2447
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:03,380
Is that their name?

2448
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,360
I can't remember NMA or something.

2449
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:06,360
Yeah.

2450
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:10,040
Um, they actually did a video on this whole, like Nintendo's losing money thing, but the

2451
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:14,560
interesting kind of silver lining to this is that apparently 15 million 3DS units have

2452
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:15,720
been sold since the launch.

2453
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:19,800
So 3DS has really recovered in many ways, which I seem to remember saying on this show

2454
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:25,160
would happen around Christmas, but anyway, um, here's the thing though, uh, Nintendo

2455
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:31,440
did basically switch their forecast around from a $20 billion profit to an actual loss.

2456
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:36,760
Hey, Nintendo had sales of 7.2 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal year.

2457
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,760
And that was a 31% decrease.

2458
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:42,960
And their overall loss was 48.4 billion yen.

2459
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:48,600
That's $620 million, um, quote Nintendo 3DS hardware during the nine months ended December

2460
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:52,020
31st, 2011 were 11.4, 3 million units.

2461
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:55,780
And the total worldwide sales since its launch exceeded 15 million units.

2462
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:59,960
That's in the official press release from the company, uh, Mario 3D land and Mario Kart

2463
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,560
7 are million selling titles.

2464
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:05,040
I want to say I've heard they're up to like 5 million actually at this point.

2465
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:10,960
So, um, apparently some of these financial woes are making people think maybe they should

2466
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,440
get into more mobile gaming.

2467
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:17,120
There's that whole talk again, maybe Nintendo should put something out on iOS, but I highly

2468
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:18,800
doubt that will ever happen.

2469
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:22,140
Their stock by the way, is currently at a five year low.

2470
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:26,320
So they have a lot riding on them for this E3, in my opinion, um, they're going to have

2471
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,580
to impress.

2472
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:33,320
If they don't impress, impress at this year's E3, it's going to be very bad.

2473
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:34,320
Very bad.

2474
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:39,920
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura is going to open up the email bag and read some emails

2475
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:44,560
for us.

2476
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:48,760
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and Dark Sakura

2477
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:53,880
dives into the email bag and reads some of those emails here on air.

2478
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:58,660
I would be able to read them if they would actually go to the email because my computer

2479
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:01,240
has decided to be a bitch.

2480
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:03,240
Okay, there we go.

2481
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:04,960
This is from blade three.

2482
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:08,640
I was interested in your setup a couple of weeks ago because I have a couple of handheld

2483
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:14,160
dynamics that are studio grade that I would like to donate to the show.

2484
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:18,600
I don't have any spare XLR cables unfortunately, but I believe you are likely already using

2485
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:19,600
them.

2486
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:22,200
So if you guys could contact me back, whatever, we can work it out.

2487
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:23,200
Thanks guys.

2488
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:24,200
Fantastic work.

2489
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:25,200
PS.

2490
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,200
My grammar sucks lol.

2491
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:27,200
Raffle party limafo.

2492
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:28,200
Heart.

2493
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:31,160
You don't give everyone a hard time.

2494
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:32,160
Heck yeah.

2495
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,160
I'll take donations.

2496
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:34,680
We could actually, actually we do need one mic right now.

2497
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:36,560
We could, and actually we could really use two.

2498
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:38,240
So um, heck yeah.

2499
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:39,840
And we have plenty of cables.

2500
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:43,560
Um, so yes, I should have responded to that offline.

2501
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,560
Sorry.

2502
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:47,240
I should have taken that out of the mailbag, but yes, we want it.

2503
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:48,960
Now everybody knows our business.

2504
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:56,240
Well, we first had, um, an email from Rubba Bubba that said, um, I looked around for sites

2505
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:58,040
blacking out today, January 18th.

2506
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,640
I'm very disappointed.

2507
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:03,120
Sites, um, that could bring a lot more force to the event are not participating.

2508
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:06,720
Google censored their own logo, but I think being blacked out would be more effective.

2509
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:10,360
The only one of my favorite sites that is down is game politics.

2510
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:13,720
Your site was also down when I checked, but something tells me that wasn't on purpose.

2511
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,720
Yes it was.

2512
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:17,240
Now we took it down on purpose.

2513
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:18,320
There should have been a message there.

2514
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,320
Now there's a PS.

2515
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,320
Okay.

2516
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,320
Sorry.

2517
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:24,600
Almost immediately after writing the email below, senators and reps are dropping their

2518
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:26,640
support from SOPA and PIPA.

2519
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:31,600
Even the sponsors of the bills, the MPAA, then responded in the most ironic way, accusing

2520
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:35,300
sites like Reddit and Wikipedia of trying to make Congress into their corporate puppets

2521
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:38,560
to further their financial empire.

2522
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:40,600
That is ironic and stupid.

2523
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:43,800
Also the Google protest seems to have caught some attention for linking their censorship

2524
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:47,560
logo directly to a petition with a very cool infographic.

2525
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:51,520
My own opinion is that piracy is already wrong and we have the legal system in place to address

2526
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,080
that via due process.

2527
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:58,320
Well, look what happened to that mega video, although, you know, it did take a while, but

2528
02:10:58,320 --> 02:11:03,080
that guy's, you know, and a lot of his people are in jail now and not getting out anytime

2529
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,080
soon.

2530
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,860
By the way, did you know, did you know that that same guy was like the number one call

2531
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:09,520
of duty modern warfare three player like in the world?

2532
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:10,520
He cheated.

2533
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:11,520
Did he?

2534
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:12,520
Yeah.

2535
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,520
How'd he do it?

2536
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,720
Uh, there's ways.

2537
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:16,720
You don't want to share.

2538
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:17,720
Okay.

2539
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,720
No, I just, I don't play quality tomorrow.

2540
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:19,720
Warfare three.

2541
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:25,440
I mean, if it's, I'm assuming it's very much like, uh, uh, you know, the other ones.

2542
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:30,360
It is ironic though that he's getting more time in jail than some rapists and killers,

2543
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:34,080
but you know, welcome to America.

2544
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:38,600
Apparently he used to play like quake and stuff like that and rude rage quit and stuff.

2545
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:41,160
And I don't know, whatever.

2546
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,160
I don't know.

2547
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:46,760
I can't really speak for, you know, playing him, so I don't know.

2548
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:48,280
Well, we have one last email.

2549
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:56,760
Oh, and by the way, people who, uh, um, sent me the, uh, master system things, I am, I've

2550
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:59,560
got two of you already and I'm going to be sending those out.

2551
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:00,560
Just let you know.

2552
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:01,560
Haven't forgotten.

2553
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:03,560
Um, I just have to get paid.

2554
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:08,040
Hey, OLR crew, happy new year and congratulations on the move to the new studio.

2555
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:12,160
The show sounds great and it's good to hear Alan is a regular contributor now, although

2556
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:15,880
I have to express my endless, oops, sorry.

2557
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:19,760
The Twitter music started playing my endless sorrow at the retirement of Shermy.

2558
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:21,440
Shermy is not sorrowful.

2559
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:27,200
She has her own room that smells like her butt, except I cleaned.

2560
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,200
It's also the laundry room.

2561
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:29,200
I cleaned it.

2562
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:30,200
But you know what?

2563
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:31,200
She's happy.

2564
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:34,120
That room gets warm every time we dry the clothes.

2565
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:40,240
Sometimes a warm towel gets dropped on her as a blanket and she's a very happy girl for

2566
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:41,240
happy girl.

2567
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:42,240
Well, keep in mind guys.

2568
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:43,240
I love Shermy too.

2569
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:44,680
You have to remember, I love Shermy too.

2570
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:48,720
She's a great cat, but we, we do have kitties in the new OLR studio.

2571
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:50,840
It's just that they're not as friendly.

2572
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:55,560
Well, they're, they're pretty friendly, but they're just, they're, they're shy.

2573
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:56,560
So they run out of the room.

2574
02:12:56,560 --> 02:13:00,360
They don't want to be in here cause they, they hide, they don't recognize Loki and they

2575
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:03,240
should recognize our soccer, but for whatever reason they pretend they don't and they run

2576
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:04,240
out of the room.

2577
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,800
So, but here's the thing.

2578
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:11,520
If you're my 3DS friend, I send out pictures of the cats in 3D all the time on swap note.

2579
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:17,200
So just ask Tiger Claw or Jason if he's listening tonight or Shane I think is in chat.

2580
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:20,920
A few of you are on my Facebook and I put pictures up on Facebook.

2581
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:21,920
Yeah.

2582
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:25,520
Especially Marco walking around with that tail in the air.

2583
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:26,520
Look at me.

2584
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:27,520
My tail's in the air.

2585
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:29,520
Look at my butt.

2586
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,520
I love Marco.

2587
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:31,520
Such a sweetie.

2588
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:35,680
Sanrio is very, very, she's, she's a cute little old lady, but she gives me the stink

2589
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:36,680
eye sometimes.

2590
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:37,680
Yeah.

2591
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:38,680
Cause you're another girl.

2592
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:39,680
I know.

2593
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:45,720
So I have two disparate top topics I was hoping that Rob, Jamie and Loki could weigh in on.

2594
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:46,720
No.

2595
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:49,080
The first being the announcement of Resident Evil 6.

2596
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:51,040
Are any of you excited by this news?

2597
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:52,040
Not really.

2598
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:54,900
Um, I don't play the Resident Evil series, so no.

2599
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,140
I got out of this.

2600
02:13:56,140 --> 02:14:01,280
I got out of the series some time ago, although I did dabble in Resident Evil 4, which was

2601
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:02,280
pretty darn good.

2602
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:04,740
And I really should have committed more time to the game.

2603
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:11,840
And then Resident Evil 5 was like, from what I hear, Resident Evil 6 is a little more like

2604
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:15,040
four than it was like five, which is probably a very good thing.

2605
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:22,480
So I'm, what I want to know is why does the logo look like a chick blowing a giraffe?

2606
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:25,000
Have you looked at the logo?

2607
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,200
Wait, let me, let me put it here in chat here.

2608
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:31,600
Well, while you do that, I'm going to finish reading the part of the email.

2609
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:32,960
Are you excited by the news?

2610
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:38,080
I am personally having a bit of a fan-gasm, seeing them bring back Leon, Ashley, and Hunnigan,

2611
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:43,780
as I am a huge Resident Evil 4 fan, but have been playing all the games since day one.

2612
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:45,880
It does kind of look like giraffe.

2613
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:46,880
See?

2614
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:47,880
It's just blowing!

2615
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:50,520
It's a chick blowing a giraffe!

2616
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:51,520
Cannot unsee.

2617
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:53,320
Yes, now you won't be able to unsee it.

2618
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:55,320
There it is.

2619
02:14:55,320 --> 02:15:00,120
Oh, Jeffrey, what have you gotten yourself into?

2620
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:01,920
That's what happened to the Toys R Us mascot.

2621
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:02,920
I haven't seen him in forever.

2622
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:07,280
I'm glad he found work on Resident Evil porn.

2623
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,880
Speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.

2624
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:14,200
And by the way, the last one that I actually played was, uh, that I really actually last

2625
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:16,960
played was Gun Survivor.

2626
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,920
The one that was like Code Veronica, Gun Survivor 2.

2627
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:20,920
Oh, okay.

2628
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:21,920
In the arcade.

2629
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,240
That was the last one I actually played myself.

2630
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:26,960
So speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.

2631
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:29,400
Have any of you downloaded the Revelations demo for 3DS?

2632
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,800
No, because I don't have one.

2633
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,800
Why yes, I have.

2634
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,240
Would you like to play a Dark Sakura?

2635
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:35,240
It's right there.

2636
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,000
I have 28 uses left.

2637
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Maybe in a bit.

2638
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
All right.

2639
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,900
I was particularly impressed by the graphical potential the 3DS is beginning to show.

2640
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:46,760
With the Vita coming out next month and games for dedicated portable systems trending toward

2641
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:52,760
console level graphics, do any of you feel that at some point the two will intersect?

2642
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:56,780
Well, haven't handheld's always kind of felt like they're just a generation behind.

2643
02:15:56,780 --> 02:15:57,780
I mean look at the DS.

2644
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:00,480
The DS is a lot like a Nintendo 64.

2645
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:03,400
Like the 1DS was a bunch of ports in Nintendo 64 stuff.

2646
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:05,880
The Game Boy Advance was a bunch of ports and Super Nintendo stuff.

2647
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:06,880
The original Game Boy.

2648
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:22,060
And I kind of like just having it kind of with the Great

2649
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:26,380
Gameboy especially the color had a lot of NES stuff on it so they're always

2650
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:32,300
kind of you know just a generation behind so I I think I don't know about

2651
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:35,380
the Vita so much I wouldn't say that the Vita is gonna have the potential to play

2652
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:40,500
like PlayStation 3 stuff although it's supposed to be PlayStation 3 quality

2653
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:43,740
graphics yeah because it because a smaller resolution so yeah that's kind

2654
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:46,980
of what I'm talking out here is that because of the smaller resolution you

2655
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:51,940
know your TV when you say 1080p that's 1080 pixels right but the amount that's

2656
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:57,040
on the Vita is less so you can still render high-definition images but just a

2657
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:02,460
lower resolution because it's a smaller picture so he's gonna look really good

2658
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:06,900
but I especially don't know about direct ports I'm more excited about this whole

2659
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:10,140
thing we were talking about earlier with the whole Vita possibly connecting to

2660
02:17:10,140 --> 02:17:15,820
your ps3 if you know with with be it hacks or whatever all I'm waiting for is

2661
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:20,980
Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Vita so well there's a little bit more I wonder if at

2662
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:24,700
some point one market might cannibalize the other while I'm personally thrilled

2663
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:29,620
by the prospect of having ps3 slash 360 quality games on the go it seems only

2664
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:33,340
logical to assume that at some point these systems will function as portable

2665
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:37,220
consoles right oh that was really the point he was getting out with that okay

2666
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:41,020
I get it now why not just wirelessly stream the content from the portable

2667
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:44,980
system to the TV in your living room if you want a console style experience and

2668
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:49,260
slip it into your pocket when you don't I understand that the Wii U is trying to

2669
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:52,600
walk the fine line between those two entities but it honestly seems like a

2670
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:57,260
letdown if the remote only works when you were in Wi-Fi range your thoughts

2671
02:17:57,260 --> 02:18:02,460
okay I get it so okay the rest email really kind of fills that in so the iPad

2672
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:10,020
too what about it it does just that you can stream content from the iPad to your

2673
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:14,820
Apple TV to your TV I get what he's saying though is that if if the power of

2674
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:19,540
what is taking up all the space in my living room is in my pocket then why do

2675
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:24,260
I need a console but keep in mind that's why console developers are kind of start

2676
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:26,820
I think console developers kind of see this too and I think that's why you're

2677
02:18:26,820 --> 02:18:31,940
starting to see things that won't fit in your pocket like connect you know all

2678
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:35,860
these streaming devices that you know will go to your home theater sound

2679
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:39,380
system and so forth and these systems becoming more of like entertainment hubs

2680
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:45,700
but I don't know like for me I don't like playing handheld games all the time

2681
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:51,100
sometimes I want that gigantic you know 34 inch or however big our TV is picture

2682
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:55,100
you know like I would want to play a game like Final Fantasy 13 2 on my

2683
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:59,580
little DS in bed you know I want to maybe sometimes it would be cool like

2684
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:02,180
once in a while for the mundane stuff but the big cutscenes and things like

2685
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:07,940
that I want to see on the hi-def TV you know I don't know I I don't know if one's

2686
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:11,340
necessarily gonna cannibalize the other but it's a very interesting point that

2687
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:16,060
you're making and it's kind of neat that now the the consoles are kind of doing

2688
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:21,220
things that the the TVs are having a hard time like 3d the TVs haven't all

2689
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:25,180
been able to adopt that across the board yet now here we have the 3ds so it's

2690
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:28,300
interesting um a lot of ports then you're gonna continue to see a lot of

2691
02:19:28,300 --> 02:19:32,260
ports like the same stuff coming out on the ps3 you're gonna see on the Vita and

2692
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:39,820
the 3ds be interesting yes to conclude yes your loyal olr fanboy tonic vision

2693
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:45,380
who I would love to commend on fantastic grammar and spelling gold star emailer

2694
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:51,460
of the week yep you win the no prize I kai judo in our chat room says my

2695
02:19:51,460 --> 02:19:54,780
thoughts is this person plays way too many video games why would you want to

2696
02:19:54,780 --> 02:19:59,740
walk around with a PlayStation 3 well I seem to hey I have a nomad didn't do

2697
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:03,620
well that and didn't they used to have that little like tiny screen that you

2698
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:07,580
could plug into the back of a PlayStation one yes make it like it was

2699
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:11,580
an actual thing play it in the car yeah I see you like play in the car and and

2700
02:20:11,580 --> 02:20:18,280
didn't somebody in this room make one for an Xbox yeah that had Xbox blew up

2701
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:24,860
by the way like literally put pow yes well it's sort of Wow less less lesser

2702
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:28,540
extent I was trying to I was trying to take it because that Xbox case is

2703
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:32,540
falling apart and so I was trying to put it in the traditional case and the drive

2704
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:35,740
that was in there where the motherboard that was in there there's something

2705
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:42,500
wrong with the power supplies or something and hooked up pop and blew

2706
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:48,500
something so yeah whatever for the record I have a nomad and I have a turbo

2707
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:54,500
Express which with a TV tuner you could hook up your turbo Express to the to the

2708
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:58,220
TV and then you could just take the turbo Express with you and with your

2709
02:20:58,220 --> 02:21:02,420
Hugh hearts I really like this comment from bocce kawa and chat and I think

2710
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:05,860
this really gives you something to think about on the topics let me read it again

2711
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:09,860
from bocce kawa at chat orange on twitter.com handheld games are different

2712
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:14,380
to me if I were to pull out Street Fighter on break at work I wouldn't stop

2713
02:21:14,380 --> 02:21:20,380
but playing Pokemon at work is quick and easy that's a very interesting point is

2714
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:23,860
think about the types of games that are being made on these systems what is

2715
02:21:23,860 --> 02:21:26,780
easier to play on the go and I think I was mentioning this before it might have

2716
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:29,620
been on Bobby show we were doing the call at the end of the Bobby Black Wolf

2717
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:33,500
show as we do every week but I was talking about how tiny tower makes a

2718
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:37,020
great iOS game because you can play it for 30 seconds or whatever and then

2719
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:42,140
you're done like it would be a terrible game to play on PlayStation 3 or

2720
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:45,860
something like that like it just kind of works on iOS and a lot of the stuff that

2721
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:49,940
they kind of try to force on iOS like ports of games like Mega Man 2 or the

2722
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:53,980
Capcom arcade where you can play Street Fighter 2 on the iPhone that's it's it

2723
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:57,820
sucks you can't control it the touch screen thing doesn't work it's it's

2724
02:21:57,820 --> 02:22:03,820
terrible so sometimes it is designing about really the right game to go with

2725
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:12,460
the system very interesting all right is that it for emails tonight that would be

2726
02:22:12,460 --> 02:22:18,700
it no more emails sad face all right well I think it's about time for the F

2727
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:23,660
use of the week this is the part of the show where we get angsty

2728
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:47,700
if you to the day I've had and not having a tablet

2729
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:53,060
Loki fuck you for the FBI going after mega upload because I actually did have

2730
02:22:53,060 --> 02:22:57,780
files they use on there and I also had a paid subscription thankfully wasn't that

2731
02:22:57,780 --> 02:23:03,700
long okay it's description but it's annoying because I lost a lot of my

2732
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:10,100
files that's more piracy related at all so yeah that sucks and besides yeah

2733
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:13,300
taking out mega upload really that stopped all the piracy it's all gone

2734
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:19,140
there's not like file sharing sites everywhere else oh yeah you lot of good

2735
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:23,620
job a lot of those file share sites block the u.s. which I thought was

2736
02:23:23,620 --> 02:23:28,220
interesting yeah that's I can get you can get around that shit I'm sure you

2737
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:35,460
can't same way you do it in China all right um my F you the week I don't know

2738
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:41,700
I don't really want too many details about it but F you to uncertainty we'll

2739
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:48,060
leave it at that all right uh let's go and do the listless results from angry

2740
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:57,060
to happy listless results here it is as you guys voted the top three to sit

2741
02:23:57,060 --> 02:24:01,420
definitive list these are the rumors that are coming next on the or they're

2742
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:08,540
not not true number three answer for the next bullshit rumor about the Wii U the

2743
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:13,820
Xbox lube or the PlayStation 4 number three answer the PlayStation 4 is

2744
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:18,380
co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as a Mega Man teabagging you

2745
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:26,420
excellent the number two answer the Wii U will steal your soul and beat it to

2746
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:34,140
Miyamoto yeah and lastly the number one answer the thing this is it is the next

2747
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:40,420
rumor and it's a thing the Wii U where the console is the controller because

2748
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:46,380
it's a big number one foamy glove there it is how appropriate that number one is

2749
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:51,820
number one ah Alan the chatters rejected both your and I answers all the way

2750
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:56,540
because I ruin their fun I pick what they like and then I get rid of it

2751
02:24:56,540 --> 02:25:01,900
everybody it's Alan the destroyer of dreams I swear I don't do it on purpose

2752
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:05,540
it's usually after the fact I'm like oh shit but then it's like I don't give a

2757
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:34,140
list list for tonight just a few more news stories for you guys and then the

2758
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:38,620
Twitter topics and your calls at one eight seven seven game olr not just yet

2759
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:43,100
we have some more stories for you guys Loki let's talk a little bit about

2760
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:47,860
Resident Evil 6 again other than the fact that the logo sort of looks like

2761
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:57,360
giraffe lacio giraffe lacio it rolls off the tongue is that censored on Xbox

2762
02:25:57,360 --> 02:26:05,700
giraffe lacio anyways so apparently it's the largest scale game ever made for

2763
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:13,100
Capcom it has 600 people involved and should be pretty expensive by that you

2764
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:18,020
know but it sounds like that apparently to put the numbers in the perspective

2765
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:26,980
Assassin's Creed 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 were completed by 450 people and well

2766
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:33,220
450 for Assassin's Creed 2 1000 for Grand Theft Auto 4 so be pretty

2767
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:40,140
significant of course it can also be very buggy who knows you ever heard this

2768
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:46,740
phrase too many cooks in the kitchen mm-hmm I want to know how on earth that

2769
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:51,460
Resident Evil box art got out it's like nobody looked at the work that the

2770
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:57,740
designer did the designer screwed it all up I was trying to get a reaction I'm

2771
02:26:57,740 --> 02:27:02,940
not getting anything she's just not paying attention to me I'm sorry what I

2772
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:08,060
said for Resident Evil resolutions I'm surprised that that got out no well I'm

2773
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:11,020
talking about the box art for isn't even you said resident evil in my brain just

2774
02:27:11,020 --> 02:27:15,660
went easy Resident Evil revelations that box art went out with a misspelling and

2775
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:19,260
I was surprised how that happened and got out I said the designer didn't check

2776
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:24,220
their work is all the designers fault and the design no blame no I'll tell you

2777
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:29,620
what happened okay well yeah first of all the designer made a typo the

2778
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:35,380
designer should have caught that but also QA should have caught that

2779
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:41,140
marketing should have caught that distribution should have caught that

2780
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:48,940
the end anyhow sorry I didn't mean to derail from Resident Evil 6 but I'm

2781
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:55,820
sure it'll be great even if the logo looks like your a fella show hey steam

2782
02:27:55,820 --> 02:28:01,820
has a new iOS client it's in beta right now but I found that it's actually

2783
02:28:01,820 --> 02:28:05,660
pretty easy well I don't know maybe I'm just lucky but I tried to log into the

2784
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:09,060
steam iOS app and it said sorry you're not in the beta and I'm like well boo

2785
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:12,740
you whore and I shut it off but then the next day I was like well I wonder if I'm

2786
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:16,060
in the beta yet I don't have an email but I'm just gonna try it anyway and

2787
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:21,060
sure enough it let me right in so I'm able to get into the steam beta app and

2788
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:24,900
here's what it basically lets you do is is basically sorry you're not gonna be

2789
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:28,900
able to like suddenly play Arkham City on your iPhone it doesn't do that okay

2790
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:32,060
you don't actually get to play the games but it's a front end for the store you

2791
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:35,060
can see the stores you can see the sales you could actually of course they want

2792
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:38,300
you to be able to spend your money right there from the you know wallet there's

2793
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:42,180
buy some games but here's something else that's interesting is that you can use

2794
02:28:42,180 --> 02:28:47,220
the chat from steam from your phone and I actually was doing that a little bit

2795
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:51,340
like I was on my phone in the other room and I started sending messages to Alan

2796
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:55,620
while he was playing Skyrim I was like lol ghost I'm not there to be doing this

2797
02:28:55,620 --> 02:28:59,340
and so he figured out that I must have got into the iOS app but the chat

2798
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:02,420
functionality is pretty cool at least so and you can see what your friends are

2799
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:05,420
playing and I guess you can still look at things like screenshots and videos

2800
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:08,820
all on the go so the good news about that is is that like if you have this

2801
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:14,420
awesome Skyrim bug that you got a video of you could get out your iPhone you

2802
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:17,580
know and say hey look at what happened to me in Skyrim dude and play it and

2803
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:21,660
then you know it's right there so that's kind of cool I bet it's a matter of time

2804
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:24,580
before maybe we start seeing some games so I don't know if it'll be like the

2805
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:30,340
same games you see on but well I guess maybe that can't happen because Apple's

2806
02:29:30,340 --> 02:29:33,140
got to have control over all that and they're not gonna exactly let steam just

2807
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:37,580
waltz right in and do that so I guess that is kind of a dumb train of thought

2808
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:43,660
I'm going down but regardless it is neat that the chat is all integrated and you

2809
02:29:43,660 --> 02:29:48,180
know what they can kind of tie together is and who knows what might come in the

2810
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:53,860
future who knows all right and dark soccer is trying to get into the app

2811
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:57,580
right yeah maybe I should check and see if they let me in yet you never know

2812
02:29:57,580 --> 02:30:05,820
all right moving on dark soccer me oh yeah that's right me how about pixel

2813
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:12,460
junk Eden guess where it's gonna be sting as in Thursday this week February

2814
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:20,700
2nd we will have pixel jump Eden come from coming to a PC on Steam so you can

2816
02:30:26,260 --> 02:30:34,220
soundtrack separately for six whole dollars ooh six dollars that's a bargain

2817
02:30:34,220 --> 02:30:38,860
at half the price I'll wait for the it is a bargain at half the price I'll wait

2818
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:44,100

2819
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:47,860
junk are pretty good games so you know and six dollars which I found one of the

2820
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:53,940
pixel junk games for PSP at RC Willie for five bucks what is RC Willie it's

2821
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:59,140
like a big lot no it's a huge expensive furniture store and they have

2822
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:02,220
electronics except they're owned by Mormon so they're closed on Sunday

2823
02:31:02,220 --> 02:31:06,700
that's weird well not the Mormon part but the part about the whole like PSP

2824
02:31:06,700 --> 02:31:11,620
games got weird all right a couple more news stories for you guys and then the

2825
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:18,580
skype line Loki all right and see the last thing we're gonna talk about here

2826
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:26,340
well last thing I want to talk about is I can online passes and especially it's

2827
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:30,300
not so bad that you know you have like an online pass for a game that has

2828
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:35,300
online content but to call it an online pass for a game that does not have

2829
02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:39,620
online content is kind of idiotic but that's what they did with kingdoms of

2830
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:45,300
Amalur reckoning they have an online pass for the game that will basically

2831
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:52,020
unlock this house of valor faction quest line which they came out afterwards

2832
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:55,540
because everyone's going well you know what the fuck you know why I have to I

2833
02:31:55,540 --> 02:32:00,300
could actually you know buy this game knew they have you know the actual quest

2834
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:03,940
line for the game you know doesn't make any sense they're saying that you know

2835
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:10,260
we always wanted to put this game or this content out as free bonus content

2836
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:15,140
like free download content that would come later on or something like that but

2837
02:32:15,140 --> 02:32:18,860
now it's being you know part of the only past and they were defending that you

2838
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:23,500
know well you know we need to do this because you know fit you generates more

2839
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:27,220
sales and blah blah anyways I don't know I just stopped paying attention when

2840
02:32:27,220 --> 02:32:33,020
they're calling it online pass for a non online game what they really should have

2841
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:42,620
done is just put out you know put bonus DLC with your you know first run games I

2842
02:32:42,620 --> 02:32:45,940
mean that's honestly would just be a different way of phrasing the same thing

2843
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:49,740
it'd be yes and people will not get pissed off they'd be like you get this

2844
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:53,460
bonus I mean no one's gonna complain oh hey guess what you know what we're

2845
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:58,220
gonna give the people that buy the new game our first content pack of DLC for

2846
02:32:58,220 --> 02:33:02,900
free everyone to be like fuck yeah that's awesome thank you for rewarding

2847
02:33:02,900 --> 02:33:06,500
you know people for buying it new but then you're saying you know instead that

2848
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:11,340
oh it's just you know it's an online you're making people feel like you're

2849
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:14,220
giving him something as opposed to taking something away exactly that's

2850
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:23,020
what it is yeah but all boils down to yeah so and in 38 studios your community

2851
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:32,580
manager muse needs a fucking learn what you never never ever ever fucking say

2852
02:33:32,580 --> 02:33:37,380
that the content was once on the disc even if it was on the disc you never

2853
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:41,500
fucking admit to that because then it is that this is that the same guy that's

2854
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:44,660
like the guy behind it who was like a big baseball player back in the day well

2855
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:47,940
Kurt Schilling is actually the head of the company 38 studio and isn't he the

2856
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:51,980
same guy that's posting online no this is their community manager okay but yeah

2857
02:33:51,980 --> 02:33:56,820
he posted online some follow-up to but no he said you know so we wanted to post

2858
02:33:56,820 --> 02:34:00,300
a quick clarification for something that we've seen a few comments on for what

2859
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:06,060
it's worth the House of Valor content was not in the finished game disc at one

2860
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:09,900
point and then removed okay so it sounded like before that it was part of

2861
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:13,420
the finished game this but it's not that they're saying that it isn't it's

2862
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:16,980
nothing that we're locking you out of it was supposed to be standalone download

2863
02:34:16,980 --> 02:34:20,620
content okay well that's great so it was the situation where it's gonna be free

2864
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:23,460
download content later on but don't fucking call an online pass because it

2865
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:28,540
still implies that you're taking some away I mean I understand that EA calls

2866
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:33,940
their passes online passes but just call it like a voucher for free DLC cuz it's

2867
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:37,700
people won't get as pissed off about that I've heard the demos pretty

2868
02:34:37,700 --> 02:34:42,140
dreadful like just because it's so buggy and like they've actually apologized to

2869
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:46,460
the demo and all this and it's kind of like dude why would you I mean I I'm so

2870
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:51,260
shocked that companies allow this to happen like how did that happen if if

2871
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:55,420
people up at the top are so upset and like I can't believe that we put out a

2872
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:59,460
product like that like oh my god why would I be give you give you $60 of my

2873
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:04,260
money to trust that I'm gonna get a good time this is what I've you know said

2874
02:35:04,260 --> 02:35:08,940
about download passes and stuff like that even though you're not getting this

2875
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:13,700
extra quest line who gives a fuck I mean seriously we're talking like a bonus

2876
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:19,380
quest DLC thing that you may or if it was you free yeah you probably downloaded

2877
02:35:19,380 --> 02:35:22,500
if it was paid if you don't like the game you're probably not gonna buy it

2878
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:28,060
and I don't think you know something like this you should really pay $60 for

2879
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:32,040
a way I mean it sounded like a cool game you know the character artworks done by

2880
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:38,140
you know Tom McFarland which you know that's pretty awesome but it's just I

2881
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:40,840
heard some positive things about it though some people say it's it is the

2882
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:45,620
game that everybody thought fable would be yeah I mean it looks cool and and I

2883
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:49,240
hate to see like games that kind of try something a little bit different you

2884
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:53,100
know sorry was it supposed to be like multiplayer MMO at some point I don't

2885
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:55,540
think so I thought it was like there was supposed to be some type of like

2886
02:35:55,540 --> 02:36:02,260
multi-person element in it that went away but I mean I don't know don't let

2887
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:07,660
it the fact that you know this online passes in there because I'd say for like

2888
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:10,780
a game like battlefield or something like that where you can't access online

2889
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:16,180
portion you know demoing it out used without paying for the online pass that

2890
02:36:16,180 --> 02:36:19,500
is kind of crippling because you can miss a whole portion of the game that

2891
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:24,700
it's kind of integral I mean people play battlefield 3 for their the online

2892
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:29,300
portion of it but but oh you know if you don't buy those new copies and the

2893
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:38,020
servers don't run yeah that makes no sense but I don't know it's whatever it

2894
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:44,260
is what it is buy it or don't all right lastly for you guys tonight I don't know

2895
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:47,980
as a resident here the state of California this this just pisses me off

2896
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:52,020
but California has agreed that they're gonna reimburse the Entertainment

2897
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:56,580
Software Association just shy of 1 million dollars that's nine hundred and

2898
02:36:56,580 --> 02:37:02,380
fifty thousand dollars in legal fees for bright fighting Brown versus the EMA up

2899
02:37:02,380 --> 02:37:07,940
to the Supreme Court let's see that the state negotiated that down from the

2900
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:13,900
1.1 million Wow now there was already reimbursements previously for the case

2901
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:19,660
in 2008 this means that California has paid out in total 1.3 million dollars to

2902
02:37:19,660 --> 02:37:25,780
the ESA yeah they're raising our tuition it and I quote Senator Yee and Governor

2903
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:29,300
Schwarzenegger wasted more than 1 million dollars in taxpayer funds at a

2904
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:33,900
time when Californians could ill afford it says Mike Gallagher who is the

2905
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:37,740
president of the ESA however we feel strongly that some of these funds should

2906
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:41,220
be used to improve services for California's youth so the ESA is just

2907
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:46,220
kind of like rubbing it in basically now the ESA did say they will donate a

2908
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:49,940
portion of the proceeds from the reimbursement to quote develop

2909
02:37:49,940 --> 02:37:54,500
after-school educational programs for under underserved communities in Oakland

2910
02:37:54,500 --> 02:38:00,460
and Sacramento hey our backyard this new education initiative will be start in

2911
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:04,420
the spring and quote harness young people's natural passion for playing and

2912
02:38:04,420 --> 02:38:08,700
making video games and connecting them to the development of critical 21st

2913
02:38:08,700 --> 02:38:13,140
century job skills well while that's all nice and good that the ESA is pouring

2914
02:38:13,140 --> 02:38:18,620
some of that money back into you know the community I'm a realist and I know

2915
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:21,880
certainly not all of it is going back into the community and that's my fucking

2916
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:26,940
tax dollars like that just went to the ESA which if I remember right is now an

2917
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:29,800
organization that was supporting SOPA and PIPA and all this stuff and it's

2918
02:38:29,800 --> 02:38:33,460
like I don't want my money they're going to draw me for this stuff okay fair

2919
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:39,140
enough they did withdraw but I still feel like in some indirect way I paid to

2920
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:43,420
help lobby for SOPA and PIPA for a short time and that kind of irritates me you

2921
02:38:43,420 --> 02:38:48,860
know I'm just I'm I I'm really irritated and I and Senator Yee will not kind of

2922
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:53,180
give up this fight and I feel like he needs to be removed from office by vote

2923
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:56,380
now sadly I don't live in a place that gets to vote for him or against him but

2924
02:38:56,380 --> 02:39:02,620
I mean sorry he needs to go he wasted that money and so did the governor but

2925
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:09,060
the governor's already gone thank God that was just a joke I look I realize

2926
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:12,460
they're not a political show and people get very very passionate and personal

2927
02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:17,140
about political stuff but I just governor Schwarzenegger was absolutely

2928
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:22,280
terrible for the state I'm sorry he was he was so bad so so bad and if you need

2929
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:26,160
proof here's one of many examples how taxpayer dollars were just fucking

2930
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:31,340
wasted and now it's like the state is fucking broke businesses are leaving

2931
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:34,820
this state they want to talk about upping taxes they're upping education I

2932
02:39:34,820 --> 02:39:41,380
mean like you know what's gonna oh you know what's gonna ultimately and oh you

2933
02:39:41,380 --> 02:39:44,620
know what's gonna ultimately end Orange Lounge radio I'm gonna tell you you

2934
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:48,080
know what's gonna ultimately end this show one of us is gonna leave California

2935
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:51,300
because we can't afford to be here anymore in our career it was almost that

2936
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:55,860
it was literally almost that yep Dan wanted us to up and move to Washington

2937
02:39:55,860 --> 02:40:07,460
and I begged I was seriously in a really bad way over over that potential I can't

2938
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:12,300
do it so I mean you well I won't do it you barely dodged a bullet and you know

2939
02:40:12,300 --> 02:40:16,900
you never know if heaven forbid myself Loki or something lost our job and could

2940
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:20,280
only find something somewhere else you know that'll be what ends the show

2941
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:23,860
because California couldn't fucking keep the business here because it's stuff

2942
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:29,020
like this well I mean on top of that they're they're turning students away

2943
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:33,860
now when that's your source of tuition right there you know for at the CS at

2944
02:40:33,860 --> 02:40:38,900
the CS level and they've raised the tuition so much yet they won't you know

2945
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:43,000
let more students come in and put some of that money into building larger

2946
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:47,260
facilities and hiring more teachers it's just absolutely ridiculous you know you

2947
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:53,700
know what I'm paying right now in junior college is just under what I was paying

2948
02:40:53,700 --> 02:41:03,700
for my four-year school in 95 I'm paying $36 unit hour and I was paying about 42

2949
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:10,540
at the University of South Alabama it's ridiculous no so I know a lot of folks

2950
02:41:10,540 --> 02:41:16,540
go Oh California is all sunshiny and all this stuff but it's it's can sometimes

2951
02:41:16,540 --> 02:41:23,220
be a little bit sad there you go sorry I didn't mean to be Debbie downer but

2952
02:41:23,220 --> 02:41:27,740
that's that's where we live and that's an important story to talk about please

2953
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:31,740
do not let senator you get it reelected he fucked up he won that he would not

2954
02:41:31,740 --> 02:41:35,060
let this go he would not let it go and I think he has to pay the price for it

2955
02:41:35,060 --> 02:41:40,860
that's that's my my thought let's take calls 1 877 game olr or a username on

2956
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:44,420
skype is orange lounge radio that's all one word the skype line is open and we

2957
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:47,820
are taking calls right now although I don't know after that downer of a topic

2958
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:50,660
people and we might have scared everybody off so let's see if there's

2959
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:56,940
any tweets whoop whoop whoop whoop that's my wacky morning DJ noise here's

2960
02:41:56,940 --> 02:42:01,260
let's talk let's do a story about pot that'll make everybody feel better at

2961
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:06,060
least a lot more relaxed make me throw up Tiger Claw has sent us a link to a

2962
02:42:06,060 --> 02:42:09,980
story on Kotaku that says hey you might want to get rid of those pictures of you

2963
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:14,500
smoking weed before you unload your Nintendo 3ds and you can imagine where

2964
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:20,580
this story goes somebody bought an Xbox off a Craigslist or GameStop or whatever

2965
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:25,260
what is this um well was from the UK where this happened where somebody

2966
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:31,700
inherited a used 3ds and on the 3ds was a picture of a dude smoking a bong which

2967
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:36,540
I believe is as illegal in the UK as it is here meaning technically it's illegal

2968
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:41,700
but you know most people won't do anything about it but still I mean

2969
02:42:41,700 --> 02:42:47,820
fucking if you're gonna sell you system back delete your pictures geez hi you're

2970
02:42:47,820 --> 02:42:51,260
an orange launch radio who's this hey it's the one and only Bronva hey I

2971
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:54,740
haven't heard from you in a while what's up not too much I've been around here

2972
02:42:54,740 --> 02:43:03,180
and there you know oh I bet you get around what's up um something

2973
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:08,660
interesting that happened to me and Jill video yesterday do tell we played dance

2974
02:43:08,660 --> 02:43:13,660
central for the very first time it took you this long I don't have a

2975
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:18,860
connect and my sister who had a housewarming she has a connect in a three

2976
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:23,460
and the 360 after she put her daughter down and the drinking kind of went a

2977
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:28,780
little crazy she suggested a rock band let's do dance central souls like so it

2978
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:34,500
was all like why the fuck not why the fuck not so you you played DDR and dance

2979
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:39,980
games for many years what did you think of dance central I the main reason why

2980
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:44,420
I never played dance central so I thought I would make a fool of myself

2981
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:53,860
still did just it was just as funny but I noticed that to me one song and dance

2982
02:43:53,860 --> 02:43:58,900
central is equal to maybe in my normal two or three song dance set and DDR

2983
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:04,100
because when I was done I felt like I was going to collapse well to be fair I

2984
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:07,220
believe the songs are a little bit longer I don't know if they're like

2985
02:44:07,220 --> 02:44:10,700
they're not full length of the song but I want to say as opposed to like a

2986
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:14,180
minute and a half it's more like two minutes I think it kind of feels like it

2987
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:17,580
is the full-length song though yeah I mean they get enough of the song in

2988
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:23,900
there that works for me so what what would you think of the songs that were

2989
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:29,300
available I was tripping out when I saw the song list I was like are you

2990
02:44:29,300 --> 02:44:35,320
serious mm-hmm have you played did you get to play the sequel dance central to

2991
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:39,880
it all yes yes cuz um we it was sitting there my sister didn't finish that one

2992
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:44,540
so we was all like you know we might as well help her and um popped it in first

2993
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:51,780
song I did with sandstorm Oh Lordy I was like Oh many a con many a con did you

2994
02:44:51,780 --> 02:44:57,900
get to see the dance for born this way I I believe somebody did do born this way

2995
02:44:57,900 --> 02:45:05,180
it was um it was pretty uh feminine wasn't it yes but what's enough alcohol

2996
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:09,820
it's all good it's all good everything's all good with alcohol that's for sure

2997
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:16,540
so did playing dance central make you go maybe I want to get a connect after all

2998
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:21,980
actually kind of yeah and then we were all talking about like how come cannot

2999
02:45:21,980 --> 02:45:25,260
we doesn't do give us power power paradise and I was like well it kind of

3000
02:45:25,260 --> 02:45:30,020
gave his dance masters you know what's funny uh I'm glad you brought this up

3001
02:45:30,020 --> 02:45:34,340
because I forgot to mention it somewhere else it was on now keys Facebook no no

3002
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:39,540
or you mentioned it as part of the UK releases the rhythm party oh I just

3003
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:42,260
totally missed it cuz I was focused on something else yeah rhythm party is a

3004
02:45:42,260 --> 02:45:46,940
game by Konami it's all the people that did dance masters on Xbox Live arcade

3005
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:51,860
and it's uh it's some like I saw the song list now if you had the song list

3006
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:56,660
up but it's seriously like a bunch of Konami originals and then born this way

3007
02:45:56,660 --> 02:46:01,540
by Lady Gaga like they finally licensed like a big song and one other one too

3008

3038
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:05,820
topics pretty much all right let's try to do one more quick one okay this is a

3039
02:49:05,820 --> 02:49:10,900
quick one this turned into like a giant 100 post third on my friends Facebook

3040
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:16,140
there was a discussion about this do you believe that using a strategy guide is

3041
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:24,900
cheating in a game my personal opinion it's not it's not cheating but there's

3042
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:30,420
certainly a reward to some people for being able to do it without it I think

3043
02:49:30,420 --> 02:49:35,820
for some people it's more rewarding to do it without it but not everybody gets

3044
02:49:35,820 --> 02:49:39,140
that same sense of satisfaction like I definitely used to be one of those

3045
02:49:39,140 --> 02:49:43,260
people it's like scuff I don't need a stinkin strategy guide to get through

3046
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:47,660
this game don't insult my intelligence but now I'm like yeah whatever get out

3047
02:49:47,660 --> 02:49:53,420
get out the iPhone let's let's pull a game facts and do that I found it hmm

3048
02:49:53,420 --> 02:50:00,100
does row is one of the many aliases of Osama me me get era along with D crew

3049

positive MA and MTO does Q represents a collaboration of him and Taku well

3050
02:50:05,980 --> 02:50:10,660

germania and dance dance revolution sorry there you go and just you know

3053
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:23,420
stand in our chat room also says using a strategy guide isn't cheating I don't

3054
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:27,900
think so I don't think so look at all these RPG games and I look at them like

3055
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:31,940
I let me get the strategy guy I cuz I know I'm going to need it and now look

3056
02:50:31,940 --> 02:50:36,020
at AC strategy guys they don't really spoil anything it's just like a guy to

3057
02:50:36,020 --> 02:50:39,900
tell you how to get through to various levels and half the time if you're

3058
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:44,260
starting to look at as a reference I will say this some strategy guides have

3059
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:49,140
cheats in them mm-hmm so only you know if you looked at that page or not

3060
02:50:49,140 --> 02:50:53,100
usually like way in the back there might be some codes to help you cheat so it's

3061
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:56,180
it's only up to you but here's my here's the other thing I would have come back

3062
02:50:56,180 --> 02:51:00,540
to your friend with is that if it's a single-player game who cares who cares

3063
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:04,820
if it's a single-player game cheat all you want you're the one that chooses I

3064
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:08,460
had to spend your $60 you know if you want to get there the hard way and get

3065
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:12,580
those rewards then yay but if you want to just you know cheat your way through

3066
02:51:12,580 --> 02:51:16,460
it and get the all the video in it or whatever then yay you know whatever you

3067
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:20,420
need to do mm-hmm it's in MMOs but then of course they have strategy guides for

3068
02:51:20,420 --> 02:51:24,100
MMOs but I don't consider like I don't consider a Warcraft strategy guide

3069
02:51:24,100 --> 02:51:29,380
cheating they bundle it in the deluxe edition would allow that if it was

3070
02:51:29,380 --> 02:51:34,020
cheating it's not cheating it's just maps and shit you know and tips yeah

3071
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:39,380
because I said this and I walked away using a strategy guide or game guide is

3072
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:44,960
not cheating well you hacked the game that's when you're cheating I agree with

3073
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:47,620
that and I think we'll leave it at that Rama thanks so much for your call tonight

3078
02:52:08,860 --> 02:52:13,740

Tigerclaw is always you can always count on you can always count on certain

3080
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:22,300
things in life you can count on taxes you can count on getting ripped off from

3081
02:52:22,300 --> 02:52:26,220
vending machines and you can count on Tigerclaw posting two stories for the

3082
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:32,580
olr Twitter every night every Sunday I have Korea is considering a move that

3083
02:52:32,580 --> 02:52:37,100
would block miners from playing online games for over three hours something

3084
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:40,740
Tiger call linked us from gamasutra the South Korea Ministry of Education

3085
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:44,820
Science and Technology is reviewing a policy that would ban miners accounts if

3086
02:52:44,820 --> 02:52:49,940
they play games for more than two hours consecutively or a total of three hours

3087
02:52:49,940 --> 02:52:54,180
in a day what would you think of that what do you think about banning kids

3088
02:52:54,180 --> 02:53:02,220
straight up from playing games we're buying you wasn't Ragnarok online that's

3089
02:53:02,220 --> 02:53:05,260
a Korean company by the way just you know there already is a law that

3090
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:10,140
prevents children under 18 from playing online games during the late nights but

3091
02:53:10,140 --> 02:53:13,660
this would be something else kind of new trying to read through some of these

3092
02:53:13,660 --> 02:53:18,340
quotes here if the game industry is really a troublemaker then the related

3093
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:21,660
government should discuss it and provide guidelines to instruct us that was from

3094
02:53:21,660 --> 02:53:26,940
a game industry representative who's trying to fight this interesting all

3095
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:29,060
right let's go to the phones take another call hi you're on orange launch

3096
02:53:29,060 --> 02:53:34,380
radio who's this look at Zaku here hey Zaku how you doing pretty good actually

3097
02:53:34,380 --> 02:53:39,600
just uh resting up right now getting ready for tomorrow's a gruellish work

3098
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:45,980
week tomorrow is a Monday yeah case of the Mondays yeah all right anyways no

3099
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:51,380
you know aside from like having not like calling in a while been busy building

3100
02:53:51,380 --> 02:53:57,180
new new PC getting battlefield 3 up and running and just spending most of my

3101
02:53:57,180 --> 02:54:03,020
time on that sorry I've been busy having pink eye like a three-year-old wonder if

3102
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:06,140
you can still spread it over the Internet's probably not let's not find

3103
02:54:06,140 --> 02:54:11,500
out but yeah I guess aside from like playing Battlefield 3 I kind of noticed

3104
02:54:11,500 --> 02:54:15,900
that this whole spat on like you know having to include online passes in games

3105
02:54:15,900 --> 02:54:20,380
and the fact that Kurt Schilling's video game company is like still trying to do

3106
02:54:20,380 --> 02:54:26,060
damage control of what were how how they ended up describing it it's like it

3107
02:54:26,060 --> 02:54:29,300
brings up a fundamental shift in the fact that this wasn't the case like

3108
02:54:29,300 --> 02:54:34,300
several years ago even like in the previous generation like Japan was like

3109
02:54:34,300 --> 02:54:38,620
the only country that really had had it out for used games to the point where if

3110
02:54:38,620 --> 02:54:42,180
I recall correctly a Supreme Court decision over there paved the way for

3111
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:48,380
for retailers actually sell used games like this wasn't like I know it was like

3112
02:54:48,380 --> 02:54:52,660
illegal to sell like used games like you know in the early days of video gaming

3113
02:54:52,660 --> 02:54:56,220
over there I'm actually with you I remember that I do remember something

3114
02:54:56,220 --> 02:54:59,900
like that not here in the US but over there yes I do remember that and so I

3115
02:54:59,900 --> 02:55:05,100
guess for some reason or another due to other factors beyond their control I

3116
02:55:05,100 --> 02:55:10,260
guess because of like bad economic times and the fact that most gamers are are

3117
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:14,020
starting to become a lot more casual like we're seeing a lot more casuals and

3118
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:19,820
then hardcores to be honest so it really doesn't justify you know having a

3119
02:55:19,820 --> 02:55:25,860
demographic that will constantly buy it on day one you know I myself I mean I

3120
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:31,260
try not to buy you know I try to buy it new but if for some reason there there's

3121
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:36,060
no compelling reason whatsoever to get it that quickly I may just opt for a

3122
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:39,900
used copy like most of the other games I bought you know most of them are just

3123
02:55:39,900 --> 02:55:43,540
like used the second-hands except for the ones that I bought new like a four

3124
02:55:43,540 --> 02:55:46,860
is a four that was definitely worth you know buying just because of the the

3125
02:55:46,860 --> 02:55:50,660
value added the fact that it was something that you know they they

3126
02:55:50,660 --> 02:55:54,300
offered up not only just an impressive card list but just like some really good

3127
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:59,540
deal see it off the bat well but then you also get like really mediocre games

3128
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:04,100
in which the only way they can really try to draw in people is to try to offer

3129
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:10,780
DLC they'll they'll make up for for a lackluster game then you also have like

3130
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:15,060
a recent example of that and I I know I I'm thinking there's something is this

3131
02:56:15,060 --> 02:56:19,220
game my mind where DLC kind of helped add stuff in a game that was kind of

3132
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:24,820
lackluster trying to think right now no it can't be Mortal Kombat that game the

3133
02:56:24,820 --> 02:56:28,900
game was pretty good on the online pass but it's like the whole notion of trying

3134
02:56:28,900 --> 02:56:33,700
to trying to stifle another industry like you know GameStop I guess that

3135
02:56:33,700 --> 02:56:37,900
that's where they're I guess my point is like they really I guess in the next

3136
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:42,220
generation we won't we probably won't see GameStop I give it like another five

3137
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:46,700
years before they're like calling it quits because they because once

3138
02:56:46,700 --> 02:56:50,780
technology gets better to the point where where Microsoft could actually pull

3139
02:56:50,780 --> 02:56:55,660
off a system that detects use game copies then you know to the point where

3140
02:56:55,660 --> 02:57:02,380
it may not be you know may not it may not be like a viable to even like sell

3141
02:57:02,380 --> 02:57:06,580
any of those new copy you know any of those copies anymore that's assuming

3142
02:57:06,580 --> 02:57:10,460
the system is successful and I kind of think I think the consumer base at large

3143
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:14,740
will reject a system with those types of restrictions in place then again it

3144
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:18,940
unless of course those restrictions are like you can't play use copies at all

3145
02:57:18,940 --> 02:57:23,340
which would be suicide for for that manufacturer anyway but something that

3146
02:57:23,340 --> 02:57:27,580
basically instead of having a paper printout of a of an online passcode

3147
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:32,380
something that gets activated for that particular account you know like if you

3148
02:57:32,380 --> 02:57:38,340
you you run the disk once and you need you need like a like an account I guess

3149
02:57:38,340 --> 02:57:42,980
like a gold account or something on an Xbox Live where it would detect that you

3150
02:57:42,980 --> 02:57:47,460
already ran this particular copy of the game and you get that online pass so any

3151
02:57:47,460 --> 02:57:50,940
other person running that game afterwards for a different account will

3152
02:57:50,940 --> 02:57:55,780
have to pay so something like that which is which takes a sting out of a

3153
02:57:55,780 --> 02:58:00,180
draconian system that would just prevent use games from playing at all well and

3154
02:58:00,180 --> 02:58:04,380
it's also insulting when I pay $60 for the game and I'm paying this premium you

3155
02:58:04,380 --> 02:58:09,900
know I get with 99 cent or dollar 99 games you know that's a digital license

3156
02:58:09,900 --> 02:58:13,220
or whatever but like you know with $60 I want my physical copy that I could take

3157
02:58:13,220 --> 02:58:16,640
to a friend's house this is ridiculous you know at some point the consumers are

3158
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:21,220
going to say no to that so I I think that whole thing was a load of bullshit

3159
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:25,180
I understand but it has to be at a point where it gets really bad right now it

3160
02:58:25,180 --> 02:58:29,260
really isn't because you know what most gamers don't really care they'll just

3161
02:58:29,260 --> 02:58:32,940
they'll just know that if the game is like really good and it's and it has

3162
02:58:32,940 --> 02:58:37,140
good reviews and it's getting a lot of buzz that they'll line up outside of

3163
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:42,100
GameStop or Best Buy to get it day one. So why was the PSP Go not successful?

3164
02:58:42,100 --> 02:58:47,420
Well I guess it's it's it's a factors in in the sense that it was all digital

3165
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:52,700
like people want and you're right you do bring up a point of having to wanting to

3166
02:58:52,700 --> 02:58:57,460
own your you know the games that you buy and I kind of have to go through the

3167
02:58:57,460 --> 02:59:01,980
same thing with Steam in that all the PC games that I that currently own are all

3168
02:59:01,980 --> 02:59:06,820
digital so you know but I know. I know very sorry sorry to interrupt but I know

3169
02:59:06,820 --> 02:59:11,100
very few people that spend like $50 to get games on Steam there are some

3170
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:15,940
there's some. I only buy on the sale or unless I really need to have that copy. Everybody buys Steam stuff on the sale

3171
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:19,140
because it's dirt cheap and so you don't mind that you're not having a physical

3172
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:24,260
copy because but there are certain times where I did buy the game for price like

3173
02:59:24,260 --> 02:59:27,540
there were certain times where I actually like how to like suck it up and

3174
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:32,700
buy those games full price. I bought one. I bought Civilization 5 at full price

3175
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:37,220
that's it. Like right now I'm gonna have to buy Skyrim full price because you

3176
02:59:37,220 --> 02:59:42,100
know what the sale wasn't like it was it was not low enough in the sense that I

3177
02:59:42,100 --> 02:59:45,260
could probably pick it up cheap later on but if I wanted to play it right now

3178
02:59:45,260 --> 02:59:48,740
would have to suck it up same thing with Battlefield 3 I bought that full price

3179
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:53,460
it was Origin but nevertheless I bought it I didn't I didn't wait for it to go

3180
02:59:53,460 --> 02:59:57,380
on sale I wanted to play that now and I still haven't bought the the expansion

3181
02:59:57,380 --> 03:00:01,660
bag yet. I just want to point out you don't have to shop around a little bit

3182
03:00:01,660 --> 03:00:06,060
because Steam is charging $59.99 still I think but I looked at Amazon for $47.46.

3183
03:00:06,060 --> 03:00:09,420
Well that's the thing that Battlefield 3 is only on Origin anything other than

3184
03:00:09,420 --> 03:00:14,540
Steam remember that whole spat where EA wanted to like you know because of what

3185
03:00:14,540 --> 03:00:19,780
Valve set up in their terms that they took most of their games away out of Steam

3186
03:00:19,780 --> 03:00:25,220
and into Origin. Why get a digital copy then? Well because it sucks having you

3187
03:00:25,220 --> 03:00:28,660
know it doesn't make a difference if it's activated through Origin because

3188
03:00:28,660 --> 03:00:33,140
that's that's where all EA games are going you know at this rate so even if I

3189
03:00:33,140 --> 03:00:38,640
have a digital copy only be tied to my Origin account just like Steam. Alright I

3190
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:43,380
gotta wrap up and let you go buddy but we'll hope that gaming manufacturers get

3191
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:47,420
the right idea what we really want. Alright yeah definitely have a good one.

3192
03:00:47,420 --> 03:00:50,740
Alright you too buddy. Alright that's gonna do it for the Sky Flying tonight.

3193
03:00:50,740 --> 03:00:54,100
We're running a little bit over tonight so we're gonna wrap it up and get on out

3194
03:00:54,100 --> 03:00:58,220
of here but first I want to go around see if there's any last-minute stories

3195
03:00:58,220 --> 03:01:04,800
Dark Sakura or Loki? Meh. Nothing I really wanted to talk about. No? I know like

3196
03:01:04,800 --> 03:01:08,180
Dark Souls you wanted me to mention there was some gaming chair so not even really

3197
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:12,380
gaming chair but like some PC pod chair thing that you know that someone's

3198
03:01:12,380 --> 03:01:17,060
trying to sell it it's really expensive and sort of looks like you know some

3199
03:01:17,060 --> 03:01:21,940
immersion rig from you know Ready Player One or something but uh oh yeah yeah I

3200
03:01:21,940 --> 03:01:25,620
saw that you know I was expensive you know and there was another story that he

3201
03:01:25,620 --> 03:01:29,060
posted that was interesting about the whole like world record somebody spent

3202
03:01:29,060 --> 03:01:33,300
like 40 hours trying to beat some DDR record and got denied by Guinness but it

3203
03:01:33,300 --> 03:01:36,700
was a little bit too busy of a Newsweek to fit something like that in especially

3204
03:01:36,700 --> 03:01:42,220
you know DDR's. I saw one that was also I was it Jimmy Kimmel or not Jimmy Kimmel

3205
03:01:42,220 --> 03:01:49,660
uh Jimmy Fallon did some really stupid record a while back where most consoles

3206
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:52,940
played in a minute you know something like that were like I don't even know

3207
03:01:52,940 --> 03:01:57,060
how you arbitrarily do that because it's like press a press a press a press it's

3208
03:01:57,060 --> 03:01:59,820
not even they have to do something for a second I don't even know what the

3209
03:01:59,820 --> 03:02:04,180
requirements like WarioWare in real life. It's stupid but then someone else

3210
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:08,180
apparently beat their record or they claim to beat the record with 13 consoles

3211
03:02:08,180 --> 03:02:14,460
