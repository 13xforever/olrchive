1
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:26,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, January 15, 2012, Kid Icarus Uprising will come with a bundled accessory, a new PC gaming tablet as shown at CES, and can Apple iOS gaming actually save your life?

2
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:32,317
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

3
00:00:54,472 --> 00:01:01,757
[SPEAKER_07]: She unexpectedly had something come up where she is in San Francisco tonight doing some friend stuff, so she's not here.

4
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:10,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So sadly, she will not be joining us tonight, but we always like an excuse to say hello to Salacious Pop, who's filling in tonight.

5
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,423
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, as usual.

6
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:18,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's kind of become the Joan Rivers of our show, the always fill-in host when Johnny Carson was gone.

7
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:21,470
[SPEAKER_07]: That reference is way too old for any of our listeners.

8
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,272
[SPEAKER_05]: If I tried to hide in the office while you were recording, I'd just get knock, knock, knock.

9
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,633
[SPEAKER_05]: The show only has two people tonight.

10
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:28,773
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to help.

11
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:32,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really want this show to be a complete failure?

12
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:32,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no.

13
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:35,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki and I have done a show alone before, but it's more fun with three.

14
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:36,937
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fantastic.

15
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Three's a crowd.

16
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, there he is.

17
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Tech Master Loki is here tonight.

18
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:42,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

19
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,020
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing, Loki?

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, Alan came to the rescue with barbecue sauce because McDonald's...

21
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:51,323
[SPEAKER_06]: If the sauces have green covers, they must be the same, right?

22
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:55,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Because habanero is just exactly the same as sweet and sour sauce.

23
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:05,688
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, always joining us, our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at all games radio, www.

24
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Allgames.com

25
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:28,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, and going to our live chat room, who's always with us, Tigerclaw starts us off saying, oh, tonight's show is a sausage fest?

26
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:42,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, if you want to look at it that way, but we will have chatter, comments, and I know there's some lovely ladies that chat with the show, and then of course Twitter, and hopefully phone calls later, so, you know, it'll be ladies night on the Skype line, hopefully, we'll get some women to call in, but you know what?

27
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:45,894
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what your gender is, we're all gamers.

28
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:46,975
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's about here.

29
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:51,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games, the gamer lifestyle, and the show where every gamer has a voice.

30
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, before we get into our gaming weeks, we usually do a little bit of topics at the start of the show.

31
00:02:58,142 --> 00:02:59,823
[SPEAKER_07]: We're up against the Golden Globes tonight.

32
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:03,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like having a show on a Sunday, we're always up against some stupid award show.

33
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:04,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's tonight?

34
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:05,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally didn't even realize.

35
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:06,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know either.

36
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the Golden Globes is tonight.

37
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, guys, are you really going to watch this show?

38
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Just read it tomorrow like everybody else.

39
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say this.

40
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:19,153
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole Ricky Jervis thing where he's a total asshole.

41
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny.

42
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:23,235
[SPEAKER_07]: He just says what everybody's thinking.

43
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:27,317
[SPEAKER_07]: That part will be cool, but I know that all the good zingers will be in the news tomorrow.

44
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:28,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he hosting, I'm assuming?

45
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:28,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that whole thing?

47
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:31,259
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not going to come back to host.

48
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,220
[SPEAKER_05]: He was disrespectful, and he did not represent our point of view.

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,804
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's like, oh shit, people love it when he trolls.

50
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit, highest fucking ratings in like 10 years.

51
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:44,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, seriously, if you want your show to have great ratings, just fucking get Neil Patrick Harris to host it, okay?

52
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,457
[SPEAKER_06]: He can host anything.

53
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:46,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's the Tonys, but yeah.

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care, he can host anything and he's awesome.

55
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:55,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I will tie this into gaming, I promise.

56
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:00,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the weekend, Alan and I have a New Year's resolution this year, actually.

57
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:07,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I should say, Alan has a New Year's resolution that I've been, and we use this term at work, voluntold.

58
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:11,346
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where you didn't volunteer for it, you got voluntold.

59
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:14,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got voluntold for this New Year's resolution, but I liked it, so I went along with it.

60
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,132
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is the New Year's resolution?

61
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:23,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something I've done in 07 or 08 that worked really well, and it's to just see one movie in theaters a month, regardless of what's out.

62
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:25,363
[SPEAKER_05]: One movie a month in theaters.

63
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:25,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

64
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:26,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

65
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,166
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's good because last year we saw like two movies the entire year.

66
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw Tangled and Black Swan and those were both done by February and we didn't see a whole other movie until a year later.

67
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my movie for February already but I haven't gotten the chance I'm definitely going to go see it or sneak out to see it.

68
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:42,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, are you doing the one movie a month thing too?

69
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,813
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but there's a movie in February I want to see.

70
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:45,273
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

71
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:46,834
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

72
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear I have never heard of that ever.

73
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:09,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll find you a trailer.

74
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really cool looking.

75
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, interesting.

76
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:16,612
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think our February movie we already decided is going to be the borrower's Miyazaki version.

77
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:18,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Studio Ghibli.

78
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:18,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghibli.

79
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:20,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Beauty and the Beast 3D

80
00:05:45,269 --> 00:06:08,342
[SPEAKER_07]: with all the football games this weekend yeah but you know come on it's Disney and you know how I feel about Disney and Beauty and the Beast really is one of the better you know Disney movies they did kind of part of that whole 90s renaissance so they did the whole 3D thing and we took our friend Victoria who I think was on the show a long time ago none of you guys probably remember her but we all went and for three of us it cost $51 to see Beauty and the Beast 3D

81
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Was the 3D worth it?

82
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:38,983
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

83
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:05,945
[SPEAKER_07]: But, oh my gosh, there's like this rush of 3D movies coming out this year that are all just fucking 2D conversions.

84
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I remember the name of the movie now.

85
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:08,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Chronicle.

86
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:10,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard of it.

87
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:14,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm just... This is why we need to see more movies.

88
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,933
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do an awesome bit of radio here and I can show you the trailer.

89
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:20,615
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what happens when Dark Sakura is not here.

90
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:23,276
[SPEAKER_07]: When it becomes a sausage fest, we can't stay on the topic of games.

91
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's the movie show.

92
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:37,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, I was happy the fact, because, I mean, I don't know if you read, they were talking about doing a live-action Akira, you know, it was going to be terrible, because it was going to be in the United States, and just made no sense whatsoever.

93
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,589
[SPEAKER_06]: But this actually looks pretty cool.

94
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see here.

95
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:47,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, before I get to that, let's see, Shesaro in our chatroom says, $51, fuck that shit.

96
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:50,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I would require to see some of Belle's Disney titties.

97
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,120
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

98
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,479
[SPEAKER_07]: There were no titties.

99
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,560
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Disney movie.

100
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

101
00:07:56,881 --> 00:08:00,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I really going to watch this live on air?

102
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I really derailing this show?

103
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know I was trying to turn this all into a 3D games chat, but hold on here.

104
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back in and look.

105
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm looking at this trailer.

106
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:12,588
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a two minute trailer.

107
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:13,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't watch all this.

108
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:14,189
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to derail the show too much.

109
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,349
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just watch part of it.

110
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:27,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So what, is this all shot like Blair Witch Project style?

111
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:39,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Not exactly, because they... The guy that's doing this is using some common sense, figuring out, you know, in this day and age, people know how to operate a camera.

112
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:41,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I see.

113
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:45,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's more like people with their own iPhones.

114
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:47,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, that was like a Furoda moment there, right there.

115
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:58,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're making a teddy bear dance with telekinetic powers and freaking out a little girl.

116
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're moving a car with their mind.

117
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe fast forward it a little bit.

118
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:08,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it's a movie about bros that get magneto powers, basically, right?

119
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:09,244
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks...

120
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:17,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

121
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:19,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, sure.

122
00:09:19,237 --> 00:09:19,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it looks cool.

123
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:20,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

124
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:20,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

125
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get it on Netflix if nothing else.

126
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:34,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what I want to... Okay, so yes, my point was, before I got so rudely derailed, they're converting all of this 2D stuff into 3D because there were how many previews before we saw Beauty and the Beast?

127
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, eleventy billion, right?

128
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:36,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

129
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:39,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's Finding Nemo, back in theaters.

130
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Star Wars Episode 1 back in theaters.

131
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Finding Nemo.

132
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Titanic back in theaters.

133
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Titanic is stupid.

134
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,242
[SPEAKER_06]: But Finding Nemo makes sense because it's all CG.

135
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Just re-render for two points of view.

136
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 3D will probably be pretty good on that.

137
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:53,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

138
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:56,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Finding Nemo, I'll give a little bit of a pass.

139
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not paying $51 to see it again.

140
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:58,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

141
00:09:58,785 --> 00:09:59,526
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be on Blu-ray.

142
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I could buy the Blu-ray for half that.

143
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:01,546
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

144
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:01,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

145
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm kind of –

146
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,384
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says it's Cloverfield but with super powered teens.

147
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:20,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

148
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

149
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:39,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you agree, Alan?

150
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:39,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

151
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:43,517
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just kind of like, it looked like it was kind of post-production stuff.

152
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:49,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and I can't imagine how terrible the ones from the 70s are going to look with the whole post-3D.

153
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I guess cool that it's back in theaters for those that want to see it in 2D, but ugh.

154
00:10:56,343 --> 00:11:00,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, my point was, now we're getting into more 3D games, right?

155
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And like 3D is kind of where gaming is going.

156
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:04,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And my thought is, inevitably...

157
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:09,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Inevitably, there's going to be a point where we're going to start seeing games re-released in 3D.

158
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:19,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for it, because we had the Halo Anniversary Edition this year, which was the high-definition remake of classic games.

159
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,602
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the industry is right now.

160
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:21,183
[SPEAKER_07]: We get all these...

161
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:22,824
[SPEAKER_06]: High Definition Remakes.

162
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,406
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little bit of clarification though there.

163
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:30,249
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some HD remakes that are kind of cool where they take the game, remake it in a whole new engine.

164
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all new assets.

165
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:31,570
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

166
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,290
[SPEAKER_06]: A new art department.

167
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:39,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the Final Fantasy X, which despite how you may or may not feel about Final Fantasy X in the series, the fact that they've come out and said they are remaking it.

168
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:40,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not an uprest.

169
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:40,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

170
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:55,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, like stuff, for example, the Metal Gear Solid collection or the, like even the God of War stuff is not really a new, I mean, mainly the Metal Gear Solid stuff because that looked really blurry and kind of weird.

171
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:03,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Or there's that Silent Hill one coming out in March that's really weird because it's kind of just up-rezzing but they had to do all new voice acting because of the

172
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Legal Troubles that one of the guys in the prior voice cast did.

173
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:07,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill is dead.

174
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, that series, I can guarantee the new game's going to be terrible.

175
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not what it used to be.

176
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:23,369
[SPEAKER_06]: They try and they try, and they try to figure out what people want, and it's just, they get it wrong every time.

177
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,772
[SPEAKER_07]: GameGuru in our chatroom says, RadRacer, I almost said RidgeRacer, RidgeRacer.

178
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:32,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that'll be in 3D at some point too, but he's saying RadRacer 3D?

179
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:33,931
[SPEAKER_07]: 3D World Runner 3D World Runner

180
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Not red, blue, but they do like the other type of glasses.

181
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:00,768
[SPEAKER_06]: They have that available, and they also have actual 3D.

182
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:01,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

183
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:10,213
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's the... But although, that technique is supposed to be to the point where the colors don't get all messed up from it.

184
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:23,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's true or not, but apparently the glasses, I haven't actually used them, are supposed to preserve the colors so that even though it is the green and kind of magenta, it's still okay.

185
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:24,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

186
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:28,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So how long do you guys think before 3D remakes become a big craze?

187
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:31,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's not forget, this is already happening.

188
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:35,149
[SPEAKER_07]: If you doubt what we're saying, remember what was the big thing on the 3DS last year?

189
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Zelda 3D was like the only thing on that console worth having for a while.

190
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course there was the Star Fox remake as well.

191
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're already starting.

192
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:48,058
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not even really necessarily putting that game in the 3D.

193
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, once again, it's a new camera.

194
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're going to be that popular because people don't really care about 3D on consoles right now.

195
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,741
[SPEAKER_06]: They have it there so they can kind of say, hey, look, we support 3D and stuff.

196
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:22,184
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not mainstream yet to where everybody has 3D TVs and everything.

197
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:26,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even the 3D TVs, I mean, the content out there is not very good so far.

198
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:30,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think it's going to be a major trend.

199
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,892
[SPEAKER_06]: You will see a ton more HD collections, though.

200
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:38,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is going to be fucking taken and put into HD, if you will.

201
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:43,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but especially when we get into the next series of consoles, is 3D inevitable?

202
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is 3D gaming really the future?

203
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:53,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually, but I don't think it's going to be something that they... I don't know, they may release a bunch of stuff for it.

204
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:54,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

205
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:57,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, you look like you're dying to comment.

206
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:18,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it should be available with the next generation of consoles but if they just say this is it like telling the consumers what they want rather than just seeing what the consumers want themselves I don't care about 3D games because you've got the TV and the glasses and all that horse shit it's like stop it

207
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:25,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Kaijudo says, I have a 3D video convert and I watched the Star Wars movies in 3D.

208
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Episode 3 looked good with all the crazy colors.

209
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:30,669
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean those Blu-rays are already in 3D?

210
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the other thing about Beauty and the Beast, that shit's been on 3D Blu-ray since November.

211
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:38,293
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I found that out, I was like, oh, well that was...

212
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:45,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that some HDTVs already, the 3D HDTVs, will convert 2D stuff into 3D.

213
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:46,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

214
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:48,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of it sucks.

215
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:52,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Alpha Canandagram says they did smooth the heck out of Zelda 3D.

216
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:57,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they better, I mean, it's gonna be on a, it'd look like shit if they didn't do something to it.

217
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:04,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff on the N64 was so fucking ugly, I don't care how nostalgic you are for the game, it was an ugly system, the games on it look like shit.

218
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:15,821
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter though, I mean, that system's old, and that system was meant for, you know, standard definition TVs, and of course you have the scan lines and everything, so, you would better do something to it, because it'll look like crap.

219
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:25,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Kaijudo in our chatroom says, they make way too many bucks in the video industry to really care about Alpha Cananogram 3D.

220
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why he said it that way.

221
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Alpha Cananogram must have made another comment earlier.

222
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,274
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was thinking, wait a minute, I don't know if the video games industry is necessarily doing that well.

223
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:38,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know we've heard about the movie industry was in a little bit of a slump this last year.

224
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:45,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, there wasn't a lot of great, great movies outside of, you know, like what the Harry Potter and, you know, a couple other things here and there.

225
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:47,384
[SPEAKER_07]: that people really wanted to see.

226
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:55,071
[SPEAKER_07]: But video games, I seem to recall reading a story this week that December did not treat the gaming industry very well, especially if your name was Nintendo Wii.

227
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:56,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo Wii, specifically.

228
00:16:56,272 --> 00:17:01,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess 3DS obviously has made a huge rebound, but Nintendo Wii, as we all figured would happen.

229
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:03,918
[SPEAKER_07]: What is there on the Wii right now?

230
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:06,840
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no title for it this Christmas, and they paid for it.

231
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the... No, they had Fortune Street, to be fair.

232
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:11,344
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Fortune Street.

233
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, they had no title on it this... I mean...

234
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out two weeks after Zelda, so what do you need?

235
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right, they had Skyward Sword.

236
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I sound like an idiot.

237
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:26,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot they had Skyward Sword.

238
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:35,252
[SPEAKER_07]: But for real, it got lost amongst the Skyrim, the Saints Row, it was a huge year this year.

239
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:36,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing, too.

240
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,834
[SPEAKER_06]: One game wasn't enough.

241
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:38,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta tell you, here's the thing.

242
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:42,058
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii, not a lot of stuff coming out for it.

243
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:50,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, they've announced Mario Party 7 and Rhythm Heaven Fever, but those are the Nintendo first party stuff.

244
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Third party, there is not much for the Wii right now.

245
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,991
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a bunch of games that have been delayed forever that are just still floating around.

246
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:02,175
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, if you look at the release list as far as Wii titles are concerned...

247
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:04,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

248
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:28,373
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2 stuff anymore, but they did one last year.

249
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:34,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, they did an original Xbox in 2010, even though that system had been done for a while.

250
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:37,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PSP is going the same way too.

251
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:45,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So the PSP is going to drop off the face of the earth this year, and obviously PlayStation 2 already is, but I think the Wii is going to drop pretty fast.

252
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be gone by the time the Wii U comes out.

253
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:48,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least...

254
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:54,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they may be putting out a couple things, but it's going to go kind of the way the PlayStation 2 is right now.

255
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:57,185
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be like Disney Channel games and, you know, just kiddie stuff.

256
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:58,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not even necessarily that.

257
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:01,268
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like really, really small third parties.

258
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:08,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all that really have, like, yeah, like Kokum, Oxygen Games, you know, Crave.

259
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,014
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a few games coming out.

260
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:16,117
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're, I mean, I don't know when they're coming out because they keep getting delayed and delayed and delayed.

261
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:16,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

262
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:36,274
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's not anything really mainstream although like I said Nintendo does have Mario Party 7 which is kind of like eh and Rhythm Heaven Fever which I know some people are looking forward to but it's not anything like a mainstream appeal Mario Party will have a mainstream appeal but Rhythm Heaven most people could skip that

263
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:43,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, as if I didn't look like a big enough idiot forgetting about Zelda, I have a little correction to make here.

264
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:48,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane's listening and he's a huge Silent Hill fan and linked me to this thing that's on the Silent Hill Facebook.

265
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:54,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, the original voices will still be in the Silent Hill collection for Silent Hill 2.

266
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:59,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're going to be able to switch back and forth between original voices and new voices.

267
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,531
[SPEAKER_07]: But Silent Hill 3 will only have the new voices.

268
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:03,772
[SPEAKER_07]: But they will be, I mean...

269
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:08,575
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, 2 was the better game, but I know 3 has its huge fans.

270
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:09,616
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 was a great game, too.

271
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:20,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say in their official little release here on Facebook, quote, Unfortunately, due to factors both technical and logistical, Silent Hill 3 will be presented with new voices only.

272
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:23,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, technical and logistical.

273
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:23,745
[SPEAKER_06]: And legal.

274
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Cha-ching!

275
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:24,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Money!

276
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:27,307
[SPEAKER_07]: But there you go.

277
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:28,888
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

278
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, enough talk about 3D and all that stuff.

279
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:32,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

280
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the stuff that we have been playing this week.

281
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:39,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually DarkSakura starts us off, so I'll let SalaciousPop go.

282
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Alan.

283
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:45,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting you go by your name now and not an online name.

284
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:48,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just too wordy to say over the air.

285
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:48,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

286
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:59,006
[SPEAKER_05]: The two big games I'm playing right now, aside from WoW, and I am playing a little bit more WoW than I was, is Skyrim and Dragon Age 2.

287
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to juggle between the two of those.

288
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: since I got the DSi XL for Christmas I've also been playing oddly enough Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass the you know the the touch the stylus only controls are actually really good they do a good job on it I have the little feather shaped stylus as the pre-order bonus so I got it when it was brand new and I'm only just now playing it it's like five year old game six year old game

289
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:25,918
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

290
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:54,206
[SPEAKER_05]: and I did cheat to give myself gold because I could not take being broke and always being in my inventory cap anymore.

291
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So clearly you're a PC player.

292
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

293
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:59,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you experimented with any of those mods like the ones that are supposed to enhance your performance?

294
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:10,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have a world map replacer that shows me where all the roads are in a way that isn't like all fakey and it's not too obtrusive looking.

295
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:14,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got a map replacer for the world map so I don't get quite as lost.

296
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is cheating.

297
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:16,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

298
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,315
[SPEAKER_06]: That is absolutely cheating.

299
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:20,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the way.

300
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:47,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I have a map replacer and the best add-on for Skyrim, and it sucks that console users can't do this.

301
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:54,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Your favorites, like the spells and the items and the weapons that you put the little star by so you can just do your quick select menu.

302
00:22:54,882 --> 00:22:57,263
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an add-on for that that organizes everything.

303
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:02,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also just a bag manager so I can sort stuff by weight and see like...

304
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:17,120
[SPEAKER_05]: why am I always at my weight cap what the fuck do I have that's so heavy and then I can sort by oh these only weigh a pound but I have 70 of them so I can put that at the top and then sell them off that's what happens when you collect cheese wheels yeah

305
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:41,264
[SPEAKER_05]: and the bug that I had that I mentioned on last week's show did fix itself I think I mentioned that too where everyone in Dragon's Reach hated me and thought I was a murderous criminal but yet the guards in the town were like sup bro what you doing like your armor bro and then and then the Jarl and his little dark elf bodyguard were like fucking get him and I'm like I didn't do anything this game is bugged as hell yeah that's fine now

306
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:47,658
[SPEAKER_07]: VidPower in our chatroom says, performance enhancing mods.

307
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:49,159
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the steroids of Skyrim.

308
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,880
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good comparison.

309
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't used the dev console in any way to give myself stats or points or skills or anything.

310
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:02,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I got myself enough gold to buy a house with some chest in it to throw my shit in and that's it.

311
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:03,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you fuck Lydia yet?

312
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:08,412
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't have a spouse.

313
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,593
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you can buy that house without actually spending the money.

314
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:11,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh really?

315
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:15,496
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I don't want to use the exploits or the invisible chest either.

316
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:19,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather just give myself 20k gold and then I'm done.

317
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:22,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if they didn't want me using that, they could patch that out right away.

318
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,541
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently they still want me to use it.

319
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:32,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I think part of the fun, I think they realize that part of the fun with a sandbox game like Skyrim is people hacking it and fucking with it, so I don't think Bethesda's going to patch that out.

320
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:34,646
[SPEAKER_07]: If people are having fun with it, they don't care.

321
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an online game.

322
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:39,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably a big part of the reason why they're not going MMO with it, at least right now.

323
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:53,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's inevitable there's an Elder Scrolls MMO Oh my god, that would be the buggiest piece of shit ever It's gonna be a beta test for six years Yeah, right, like they'll beta test anything with that It's good You sure?

324
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:54,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you check?

325
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:08,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good And Dragon Age 2 is awesome, but it's hard to juggle two meaty games like DA2 and Skyrim Alright, let's move on to Loki Loki, how was your gaming week?

326
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,189
[SPEAKER_06]: My game of the week is pretty good.

327
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I just played Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Skyrim.

328
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:21,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Skyrim I'll mainly talk about because no one wants to hear about Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

329
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say one of the best weapons in the game, I don't know if you've come across this yet, Alan, but the Wabbajack.

330
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:30,769
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wabbajack is awesome.

331
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:36,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Wapjack is a staff that casts or transforms things into random things.

332
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:45,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for example, you can cast it on people and the first time I hit somebody with it, it kind of went all Scott Pilgrim and they exploded into coins.

333
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:47,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

334
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:48,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

335
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:08,857
[SPEAKER_06]: and then, uh, actually the quest to get that was also really weird, which is pretty fun.

336
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:13,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, yeah, the game is still really glitchy for me.

337
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:18,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I just gave up on that one quest that I can't get to the person because they're under the map.

338
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:24,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's just like, well, there's no way to get this person, so, uh, the hell with this.

339
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:26,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um,

340
00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:29,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'm still having fun with it.

341
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:33,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm level 41, I think?

342
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little further along than that.

343
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:41,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but I have... I think I capped out a few different skills already.

344
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,636
[SPEAKER_06]: My blacksmithing, I know.

345
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:45,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Alchemy and some other stuff, but...

346
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:49,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still fun.

347
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:53,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't play any this weekend, although I probably will tonight.

348
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:57,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, still wasting tons of time in the game.

349
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have 90 hours in it now.

350
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:01,677
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

351
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:03,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

352
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,680
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's all I played this week.

353
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:09,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

354
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:37,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say rip-off, because I called it that somewhere else, and somebody was like, it's not a rip-off, it's more inspired by it.

355
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:39,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay, but it really is like Zelda.

356
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:41,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So fine, inspired by Zelda.

357
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I did remember one thing I played.

358
00:27:44,235 --> 00:27:44,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shut up.

359
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,616
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, what?

360
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:47,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Mole Cart for the iOS.

361
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:49,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

362
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,321
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's coming up in the show later, so hold off, yeah.

363
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:54,883
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see.

364
00:27:55,784 --> 00:27:56,825
[SPEAKER_07]: What else did I play this week?

365
00:27:57,225 --> 00:28:04,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I played, I will say on the new front, I did check out that Final Fantasy XIII 2 demo, like I think a lot of you guys have, because that's one of the...

366
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Big things that's holding people over right now that came out on the Marketplace this week.

367
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked the demo.

368
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:20,008
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, disclaimer, I also really liked Final Fantasy XIII, and I realized the gamer populace as a whole had its problems with it for being too linear.

369
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:22,912
[SPEAKER_05]: It was too linear, and there's no towns, and you only have to do one thing.

370
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:25,154
[SPEAKER_07]: And the character design is da-da-da-da.

371
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, if you... I mean, and I get it.

372
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:36,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not excusing it, but I just will say, if you stick with the game, you will find that Vanille has multiple layers to her.

373
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:37,783
[SPEAKER_07]: She is not all he-he girl.

374
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, there's definitely a past there that...

375
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:41,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go and finish Lost Odyssey.

376
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,236
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

377
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:19,137
[SPEAKER_07]: to Crystallarium.

378
00:29:19,578 --> 00:29:21,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Much easier and not as big of a pain in the ass.

379
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,439
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's much easier to use.

380
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:31,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey look, townspeople, where you can talk to random people and they'll tell you things and it kind of feels like a town and you have multiple places you can go.

381
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:34,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're definitely trying to sneak all this in the demo.

382
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:36,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on top of that, you know,

383
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:56,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it interesting that your party is actually only two people and your third character is that monster and your monster can be one of three monsters but the monsters all fall into one of the different categories like Sentinel or Commando or Ravager if you're familiar with Final Fantasy XIII these are kind of the character classes

384
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:03,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like a build your own third character is really what it feels like to get the types of paradigms that you want.

385
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, you know, I fucking love the battle system in XIII.

386
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:07,919
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of its huge strengths.

387
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And Final Fantasy XIII too is really just expanding on that with letting you kind of even go further with the paradigms.

388
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:21,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know this character has her haters, but I will say Chocolina is amazing.

389
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:21,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

390
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:28,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Chocolina is like half Vegas showgirl, half Chocobo cosplayer at a dinky anime con.

391
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:32,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Carnival in Argentina or something, or Rio de Janeiro.

392
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,110
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty bad.

393
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:40,254
[SPEAKER_07]: And she has a voice actor like this, and she just sounds like she's so happy.

394
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:42,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I was dying.

395
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:50,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And I immediately went on all my Warcraft servers and reserved the name Chocolina for future use, possibly with Pandarins later on.

396
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:53,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I guess that was really about it.

397
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:55,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to think if there was anything else.

398
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:59,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, DS, I went back and started playing Retro Game Challenge on the DS again.

399
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:02,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, again, I was kind of revisiting old games I wanted to play again.

400
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And Retro Game Challenge was an awesome DS game.

401
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:07,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you liked, you know, 8-bit classics.

402
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:10,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

403
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:16,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's go to, I'm trying to see if our, in the chat room at chat.orangelunchradio.com.

404
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitstun in our chat room says, I thought the full game was out already.

405
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,415
[SPEAKER_07]: January 31st is the full game.

406
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:22,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, very close.

407
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:23,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Same day as Soul Calibur 5, right?

408
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:24,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

409
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:24,940
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a busy week.

410
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Same day as Never Dead also.

411
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:27,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, busy week, busy week.

412
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:34,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, it gets, it's weird, it kind of gets busy for, actually starting from the 31st, which is very unusual.

413
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:36,509
[SPEAKER_06]: February has a lot of big games.

414
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:37,369
[SPEAKER_07]: All the delayed games.

415
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mass Effect in February, right?

416
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,511
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's March.

417
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:40,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, March, wow.

418
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:41,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang, it's gonna, it's gonna get busy.

419
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:55,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's, February is, uh, Binary Domain, um, Twisted Metal, uh, UFC 3, um, no, I'm thinking, forgetting a ton of shit.

420
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:55,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

421
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:00,837
[SPEAKER_06]: SSX, I'm looking forward to SSX

422
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,486
[SPEAKER_07]: All the way to Chapter 11.

423
00:32:43,021 --> 00:33:10,038
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not that same feeling like in Final Fantasy 7 when you get out of Midgar and then all of a sudden holy shit world map like it's not that great but I get the sense that Final Fantasy 13 2 is going to start with that kind of chapter 11 feeling right up front and I'm not talking about bankruptcy so I'm really excited about the game I already have mine pre-ordered and now I'm realizing shit I gotta get I have to get a PlayStation Vita and I have to get Soul Calibur 5 I'm gonna be broke you don't have to why do

424
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:12,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I want it.

425
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:14,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he makes bad choices.

426
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:15,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me guess, because you want Luminous, right?

427
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:16,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

428
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:17,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a launch title.

429
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:18,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

430
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not?

431
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:19,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was.

432
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

433
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll wait until Luminous is out then.

434
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:23,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give it some time.

435
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:29,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because if they're talking about it bombing as quickly as they think it is, you might want to wait just a little bit.

436
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:30,305
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

437
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:30,746
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

438
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:31,166
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

439
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:31,566
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

440
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:32,727
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

441
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:39,531
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, Luminous isn't even on their release list yet for Ubisoft.

442
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:41,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

443
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:43,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Some quick housekeeping going on tonight.

444
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:46,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

445
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:50,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

446
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:55,260
[SPEAKER_07]: You can follow us on there and we'll give you little previews on what's coming up on the night show and so forth.

447
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, our website, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

448
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:02,504
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in early talks about talking about some upgrades for the website for this year.

449
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:04,505
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really awesome, especially the forums.

450
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:08,027
[SPEAKER_07]: We really want to, and somebody was commenting on Facebook today about the forums and like

451
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:09,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Forums need to get cleaned up.

452
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,628
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, yeah, we know.

453
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:12,808
[SPEAKER_07]: We really want to make that workable again.

454
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:17,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope you guys will be ready for that when it's done, which hopefully will be in the next month.

455
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:18,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be cool.

456
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to plug the spinoff show Horde House if you like World of Warcraft.

457
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,972
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a whole other show about World of Warcraft, but it's not that serious, just like this show.

458
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:29,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Hordehouse.com if you want to check that out.

459
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:32,713
[SPEAKER_07]: H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E dot com.

460
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:34,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's everything I wanted to plug tonight?

461
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:35,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

462
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:37,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get into some gaming news.

463
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:37,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

464
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:40,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess truly it's conflicting information.

465
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:44,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazon's saying it is a launch title, but Ubisoft's not.

466
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:45,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

467
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:49,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the Vita since we were just talking about the Vita.

468
00:34:51,108 --> 00:35:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that was announced during CES was Music Unlimited was going to be something that's going to be featured on the Vita when it launches here in North America.

469
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:09,223
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course that's Sony's cloud-based music service that I think they actually have on the PlayStation 3 right now as well.

470
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:25,076
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the other things that they did announce as well is a kind of a video editor called Play Memories and that's going to be for the PlayStation 3 and I also believe the Vita as well which is kind of neat.

471
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:26,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, maybe only the PS3.

472
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:28,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was also on the Vita.

473
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

474
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and they'll allow you to manipulate photos and videos through the PS3.

475
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:36,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they had a video editor.

476
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:40,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they had one that came with the iCamera that you could download.

477
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:44,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they had something very basic too, but this sounds like... Maybe this is a little bit better than that.

478
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:46,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a version 2.0 or something.

479
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:48,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

480
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, some sales numbers came out as well.

481
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,291
[SPEAKER_06]: The Vita sold 500,000 units in Japan.

482
00:35:55,811 --> 00:36:05,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, they're saying that also we're going to be expecting Netflix to be coming to it as well near launch in Europe and the United States.

483
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big surprise.

484
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:09,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Netflix is on everything, so...

485
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:13,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be kind of lost if it wasn't on the Vita as well.

486
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:16,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So, not a big surprise there.

487
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:23,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the data plans for the Vita, if you buy the 3G version, have come out.

488
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:27,097
[SPEAKER_06]: 18, he's going to charge you $14.99 a month.

489
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is, of course, no contract.

490
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:30,140
[SPEAKER_06]: $14.99 if you want 250 megabytes per month.

491
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And $25 per month if you want 2 gigabyte cap.

492
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:51,865
[SPEAKER_06]: and honestly, I mean, since you're not going to be using 3G to download games because that'd be so fucking slow, I would recommend, I don't know, I'd recommend not getting the 3G version to be honest.

493
00:36:52,305 --> 00:36:53,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Just save some money and just...

494
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,148
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some folks in the chat room.

495
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Taiki in chat says, I'm going for broke.

496
00:36:59,052 --> 00:36:59,833
[SPEAKER_07]: 3G all in.

497
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:03,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Alpha Cananogram in 3D says, getting 3G for the hell of it.

498
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:03,658
[SPEAKER_07]: GPS.

499
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

500
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:07,043
[SPEAKER_06]: GPS.

501
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:09,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Then why not... I would just recommend getting a...

502
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:13,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Game like a virgin mobile phone or something like that.

503
00:37:13,728 --> 00:37:14,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I pay $25 a month.

504
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:15,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlimited data.

505
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also 3G.

506
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a phone.

507
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and if you root it, you can tether to it.

508
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So, nah, I get 3G anyways.

509
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:31,594
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, if you want to get the 3G version, more power to you, I guess.

510
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:33,535
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what it's going to cost you.

511
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:36,171
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

512
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:40,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to look up how the 3DS sold when it originally came out in Japan.

513
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:44,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, a lot of people are really dogging on the Vita and its sales numbers.

514
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:45,893
[SPEAKER_07]: But how did it compare to the 3DS?

515
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:47,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the 3DS had a lot of growing pains too.

516
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:51,074
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, obviously that was kind of a very slow build.

517
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:55,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, is it really fair to be razzing on the Vita when the 3DS had its share of launch problems?

518
00:37:55,775 --> 00:38:01,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not hardware necessarily, but, you know, just quality of software.

519
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:09,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I teased you that you want to get the Vita on launch day because it's important to you that they lower the price of the Vita six months later.

520
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:14,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Then have an ambassador program where you get fucking Crash Bandicoot and they're like, that's all the vintage shit we have.

521
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:15,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, thanks.

522
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:15,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

523
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:18,027
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can be mad about something else.

524
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope for a Final Fantasy game, but I guess that's the wrong company.

525
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:21,589
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be a first party.

526
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

527
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:28,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Also going to our chat room at chat.orangelaunchery.com, Rama says, if you're smart, get the Vita from AT&T.

528
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:30,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be $99 with a two-year contract.

529
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:31,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

530
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:31,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that true?

531
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:32,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear about that.

532
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:33,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds interesting.

533
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:37,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably speculation because there's no contracts for it.

534
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:40,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's an arrangement that AT&T could have, though.

535
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma says, tether off your smartphones, people.

536
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:48,589
[SPEAKER_07]: STO Under Matt says, I don't see the point of the 3G since it's Wi-Fi everywhere.

537
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,410
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

538
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

539
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about some PC gaming.

540
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:20,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, one big PC game we're going to get at some point in 2012 is Diablo 3.

541
00:39:21,198 --> 00:39:32,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there was a very interesting kind of controversy this week with Diablo 3 where Bashyok, one of the community managers for Blizzard, posted on Twitter essentially that Diablo 3 was confirmed for consoles.

542
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,812
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't say that, but he did...

543
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:41,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer a user question saying, oh, well, that's already in the works and so-and-so is the manager behind it, basically.

544
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So it pretty much confirmed without confirming it that there is a version in the works.

545
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:51,270
[SPEAKER_07]: But then Blizzard came back and quickly kind of revoked that tweet saying, you know, we have no announcement on that at this time, but...

546
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, people.

547
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:53,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We've known for forever.

548
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard's been hiring the people for consoles.

549
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:58,575
[SPEAKER_07]: They're at least exploring a Diablo 3.

550
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:00,776
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll probably do it.

551
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:06,960
[SPEAKER_07]: But my question is with the real money auction house, how in the hell is that going to work on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network?

552
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:11,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can't see that they're going to be able to run something like that on those services.

553
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:16,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to be a huge moneymaker for Diablo 3 and essentially fund the whole online multiplayer part of it.

554
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:19,988
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

555
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good at that tonight, by the way.

556
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:41,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going back to what you were saying about the 3DS.

557
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:44,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, how often or how far from launch were you talking about for numbers?

558
00:40:45,325 --> 00:40:47,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, well, it's been a couple, okay.

559
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:48,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So within the first, I'd say, week, they sold 282,000 units.

560
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:48,706
[SPEAKER_06]: In the U.S.

561
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:48,906
[SPEAKER_06]: or Japan?

562
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:49,407
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Japan.

563
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:50,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all right.

564
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:05,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

565
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:07,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in about a week.

566
00:41:08,254 --> 00:41:09,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, they're a little ahead.

567
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:11,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's fair.

568
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:18,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but it isn't millions, you know, but, okay, so it did a lot.

569
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:19,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the 3DS.

570
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:20,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It had some more people.

571
00:41:20,906 --> 00:41:27,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it launched in February, or towards the end of February, and by the end of March, they were about 800,000 yens in Japan.

572
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:30,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so 3DS was ahead.

573
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:46,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, also on the Diablo 3 front, one other thing I wanted to say is that one fact that could be holding up the game, or people have been speculating to hold up the game, from a global launch that Blizzard has insisted on doing, is the ratings in South Korea.

574
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,982
[SPEAKER_07]: The game has not been able to be rated in South Korea for forever, and a lot of that is because of the Real Money Auction House.

575
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:56,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the news came out this week that Diablo 3 was officially rated.

576
00:41:56,824 --> 00:42:00,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rated 18+, according to the game's rating board page.

577
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:06,027
[SPEAKER_07]: and so that means that now it's been rated everywhere so Blizzard, how about a release date?

578
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:11,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless there is truly something else holding up the release of this game that is highly anticipated.

579
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:14,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else looking forward to Diablo 3 or is it just me?

580
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I'm getting a free one thanks to the Warcraft Blood Pact.

581
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:19,572
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

582
00:42:35,260 --> 00:43:01,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it pop up on one of the new communities on LiveJournal I've been following is ONTD Games because now ONO they didn't have a games community and the story popped up on there like it was new news and it was sourced to a site that had just run it this week so I think Blizzard is putting it out there again for whatever reason but yeah you can still sign up for it so hey if you want to tell Blizzard you're going to give them money every month for 12 months I think they're going to let you do it I just think the rewards are going to change at some point

583
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:06,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the record, no, I'm not excited about Diablo 3.

584
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:09,327
[SPEAKER_07]: But you never really played Diablo 2, did you?

585
00:43:09,908 --> 00:43:10,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Diablo 1.

586
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:12,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Diablo 1.

587
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not the 3 then?

588
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:16,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play that much on PC.

589
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:27,678
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't seem like... Right now, I'm doing a lot of looting and grinding in Skyrim, and that kind of fulfills my need for doing looting and grinding.

590
00:43:27,698 --> 00:43:30,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need another game to do that.

591
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane, by the way, looked up the whole Luminous thing in private message.

592
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:37,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out February 22nd is the release date.

593
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:39,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's launch window, like that first month.

594
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:40,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's put it this way.

595
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:43,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on Ubisoft's release list yet.

596
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think that's tentative.

597
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:48,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that it's actually coming out that day yet.

598
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I would trust Ubisoft and their information, you know.

599
00:43:53,516 --> 00:43:57,679
[SPEAKER_06]: because they just sent us the update about Ghost Recon being delayed to May.

600
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,501
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not on the release list.

601
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:05,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I will ask this week, though, because I was curious on that myself, especially since they have box art now.

602
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:07,345
[SPEAKER_06]: That usually means that's close.

603
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And the song list in Luminous looks hot.

604
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:15,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And they could very well say, oh, yeah, here, it's coming out on the 14th or 22nd or whatever.

605
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:18,112
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

606
00:44:18,132 --> 00:44:19,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, what do you got for us?

607
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:21,970
[SPEAKER_05]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE HOUSE PARTY 2012

608
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:49,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the same thing.

609
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,391
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing in the winter.

610
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:52,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the 2012 of the Hurrah!

611
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:54,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Our XBLA is so awesome.

612
00:44:54,934 --> 00:45:13,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to start on February 15th with the titles Alan Wake's American Nightmare, The Long-Awaited I Am Alive, EA's Warp, and a game that's name is spelled so confusingly I think it's just deliberately there to troll.

613
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:17,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It's N-E-X-U-I-Z, which I'm calling Nezui's.

614
00:45:19,142 --> 00:45:20,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Nexes, maybe?

615
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Nexes.

616
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:23,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Nexuese, though.

617
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:24,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it sound exquisite.

618
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:35,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Those four games, we don't really have prices yet point-wise on what they're going to be, but February 15th is when those four games are going to drop and all that goes down.

619
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:43,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's a part of this for Windows 7 mobile operating systems for the Windows 7 phones, the smartphones that Windows put out.

620
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone has either an iPhone or an Android, so whatever.

621
00:45:48,105 --> 00:45:51,207
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a bunch of games coming out for that as well.

622
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,209
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're also among one of those people that plays games for Windows Live,

623
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody?

624
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:57,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?

625
00:45:57,596 --> 00:46:00,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have Game Room on Games for Windows Live.

626
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:02,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the last time I touched it, but it's there.

627
00:46:04,818 --> 00:46:06,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you glad you bought those games?

628
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:06,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

629
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,340
[SPEAKER_05]: House Party starts February 15th of those four games.

630
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:15,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any buy four, get one free?

631
00:46:16,222 --> 00:46:18,863
[SPEAKER_07]: If you buy all four of those games, get $100 stolen from your Xbox account?

632
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:24,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I've checked a few sites, including Major Nelson's blog post, and no, it doesn't really seem that way.

633
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:25,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

634
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:31,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And this one's supposed to be geared more towards teenagers and stuff, because hence their edgy commercial that they had in there.

635
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, edgy.

636
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:36,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, edgy being that there's teenagers having a house party, you know.

637
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, everybody has a house party.

638
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:39,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

639
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:42,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm going to grab the liquor and we're going to play Xbox Live Arcade.

640
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Your house party is invalid.

641
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

642
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:47,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Your house party is invalid without kid and play.

643
00:46:47,444 --> 00:46:47,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

644
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:48,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be real.

645
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:49,585
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

646
00:46:50,145 --> 00:46:57,229
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want a house party, Microsoft, if you want a house party people are going to pay attention to, you need to find out whatever the fuck happened to Kid and Play.

647
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:04,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure one of them is not dead, but... One of them's got to be alive somewhere and desperate for money.

648
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:06,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to Wikipedia right now.

649
00:47:06,753 --> 00:47:07,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know what happened to Kid and Play.

650
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:17,539
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have also, there's a game from Double Fine coming out for the Kinect that's like, I don't even remember what the fuck they're calling it, but it's just a bunch of little Kinect mini games for...

651
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:20,683
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, from Double Fine.

652
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:26,748
[SPEAKER_06]: But it almost surprised me a lot of that was the Kinect... What are the free shit that they put out?

653
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:27,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun Labs?

654
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:29,149
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that, but paid.

655
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:37,875
[SPEAKER_07]: On June 23, 2010, Kid and Play appeared on Lopez Tonight and performed Rollin' with Kid and Play from their album Too Hype.

656
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:46,201
[SPEAKER_07]: At a 2010 Tribeca Film Festival, Kid stated that Play and I also have a television series in the works, so the future is bright.

657
00:47:46,221 --> 00:47:46,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd watch that.

658
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:47,682
Ha ha ha!

659
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,372
[SPEAKER_07]: How fucking old are Kid and Play now?

660
00:47:52,392 --> 00:47:53,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me look at this up here.

661
00:47:53,272 --> 00:47:55,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Kid was born in 64, so he's 47.

662
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:58,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet he could still get down.

663
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:06,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in Xbox news, Microsoft has released the sales numbers, which they haven't done since October.

664
00:48:07,837 --> 00:48:15,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds like 66 million units sold worldwide as of this press release they put out.

665
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:17,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And by units, they mean stolen Xbox Live accounts.

666
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:24,287
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time they... Funny enough, half of them were sold in Poland, and we can't figure out why.

667
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:24,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

668
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:35,753
[SPEAKER_05]: uh then that's roughly 10 million more than the 55 56 million they said that they had sold worldwide at the end of October so 10 million over one holiday season

669
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:44,344
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kinect now is at 18 million units, which I don't know what the numbers are for the move, but I'm pretty sure it's not 18 million.

670
00:48:44,364 --> 00:48:45,765
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably not 18 million.

671
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:50,369
[SPEAKER_06]: You can never really get accurate numbers of the move because they count every single little accessory.

672
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,592
[SPEAKER_06]: They sell you the starter kit.

673
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:58,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look, we've sold you three move units or four move units.

674
00:48:58,996 --> 00:49:02,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Number of Kinect games worth it for those 18 million people?

675
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:04,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Two.

676
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:06,106
[SPEAKER_07]: It's growing.

677
00:49:06,747 --> 00:49:08,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's slowed down, obviously.

678
00:49:08,688 --> 00:49:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It's plateaued since the insane launch week that Kinect had, but 18 million units is a very respectable number.

679
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they've come out and said that live accounts that are in service, which means that people have just configured a live account and they log into it, not necessarily gold, but live accounts is nearly 40 million users, which is about 60% of the worldwide sold.

680
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:51,922
[SPEAKER_05]: 60% of Xbox users have live in some capacity even if it's not gold they're not paying for it now where's the number about how many of those accounts are still uncompromised because that's what I'd like to know so as far as those 40 million silver versus gold it doesn't say but 60% is pretty reasonable I think

681
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:52,817
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:12,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

683
00:50:13,545 --> 00:50:14,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

684
00:50:14,626 --> 00:50:27,317
[SPEAKER_07]: VidPower actually links an article he found that's related saying that as part of the house party promotion, if you buy all four games, you will get 800 Microsoft points free, which is like, what, a quarter of a FIFA gold pack?

685
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I see what you did there.

686
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:30,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like 20%.

687
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:31,902
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

688
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,663
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

689
00:50:34,604 --> 00:50:35,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, Loki.

690
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:35,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

691
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:44,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, there was rumors that, oh, the new systems, PlayStation and Xbox, are going to be at E3.

692
00:50:44,796 --> 00:50:48,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's too soon at least for the PlayStation.

693
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:53,483
[SPEAKER_06]: According to Kaz Harai, PlayStation 4 will not be at E3.

694
00:50:54,364 --> 00:50:57,406
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no plans on bringing it out at E3.

695
00:50:57,446 --> 00:51:02,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says, you know, we're not making announcements at E3.

696
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:02,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

697
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:09,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to just say, I told you so last week on the show, but to be fair, pretty much everybody was thinking that this would be the case.

698
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:14,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't take Miss Cleo to figure that out, that there was not going to be a PlayStation 4 at this next E3.

699
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:25,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what it's going to be, I think it'll be at least a year after, and honestly, I mean, I know that they're kind of like, okay, whoever's first out of the gate is going to have the best chances as far as it goes.

700
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:32,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that Nintendo's going to be stumbling out of the gate, to be honest, and I don't think they're really going to have to play much catch-up, and

701
00:51:33,304 --> 00:51:36,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides, give it another year and they can copy whatever works well on Nintendo's system.

702
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:42,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I could sort of see Microsoft announcing a new console, but they don't have to.

703
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:46,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're right, I think they can give Nintendo a chance to eat dirt a little bit, maybe.

704
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:58,061
[SPEAKER_07]: But Microsoft, especially after the story that Alan just read about that the sales numbers are still good, Microsoft still... If they could get those one or two killer Kinect games...

705
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:03,123
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm talking something better than that Star Wars thing that still isn't out.

706
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:07,984
[SPEAKER_07]: If they could get those one or two Killer Connect titles that even the hardcore gamers must have, I think they're going to have it.

707
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:13,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Now here's a real question about Sony and I think this is a much better question.

708
00:52:13,806 --> 00:52:18,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to play games analyst for a minute, those of you listening, here's a real question for you.

709
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: How much emphasis will still be on the Sony move this year?

710
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:26,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a real question to ask about E3 is that will Sony give up

711
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:38,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like maybe they did on the, well, I guess the PlayStation Eye kind of turned into the move, but, you know, will PlayStation decide to give up on the move a little bit now that they're going to have the Vita out, and maybe we'll focus on that a little more?

712
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:43,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are they really still going to push the move as an alternative to the Kinect and to the Wii?

713
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,131
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a question for you.

714
00:52:45,431 --> 00:52:46,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I think

715
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:49,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they've kind of succeeded in a few avenues there.

716
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:59,077
[SPEAKER_06]: One, they've got better integration with their motion control stuff into their core games than Microsoft does.

717
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:09,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because, hands down, the move for Resistance and Killzone and SOCOM and stuff like that, it actually seems like it would work.

718
00:53:09,702 --> 00:53:14,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Versus Voice Commands to Throw a Grenade in Halo, which seems very tacked on.

719
00:53:14,504 --> 00:53:14,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

720
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:16,525
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

721
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:38,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I have to go to chat room with this comment.

722
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:41,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaijudo in our chat room says, Microsoft needs a new system.

723
00:53:41,644 --> 00:53:42,725
[SPEAKER_07]: That thing is dead.

724
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:46,086
[SPEAKER_07]: With all due respect, did you not hear what Alan just said?

725
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:48,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, about the sales figures.

726
00:53:48,787 --> 00:53:50,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And, dude, I get what you're saying.

727
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:54,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, especially after the whole hack crap, you know how I feel about the Xbox.

728
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:55,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get what you're saying.

729
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,191
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think Microsoft, let me kind of give you an analogy.

730
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:00,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft is right now, especially with the Kinect,

731
00:54:01,332 --> 00:54:04,415
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting kind of where Nintendo was about three years ago.

732
00:54:04,935 --> 00:54:09,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the core gamers, like yourself and some of us, weren't taking them so seriously.

733
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet they were still slaying with sales figures because the families were adopting them.

734
00:54:14,683 --> 00:54:16,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's kind of where Kinect is right now.

735
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:21,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, maybe they're losing a lot of core gamers, but they're still selling systems.

736
00:54:21,568 --> 00:54:22,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can't call it dead because of that.

737
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:24,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're losing core gamers at all.

738
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in fact, I think that Kinect's working well.

739
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,414
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, I don't think they are either.

740
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:29,995
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

741
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:42,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the PlayStation 3 is gaining a lot of ground I think it's not that the Xbox is running away with core gamers but I think a lot of core gamers are now looking at the PlayStation 3 going, huh, maybe I want one of those

742
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:45,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

743
00:55:01,391 --> 00:55:06,275
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they have their core gamers that are playing their franchises and stuff that they keep putting out.

744
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:22,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've tried to get people excited that are playing core games to buy the Kinect with Forza 4 stuff and with Halo but honestly it's just such a poor attempt at tacking that stuff on that's not really accomplishing what they're hoping to accomplish.

745
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,211
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to get people to kind of

746
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:26,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

747
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:55,450
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it's not working right now because what they've done for these core games to implement Kinect functionality is really cheap, and it shows.

748
00:55:56,091 --> 00:56:03,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess going back to the original question about the PlayStation Move, I guess you will always have those games that are ported to the Move from the Kinect.

749
00:56:03,716 --> 00:56:05,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even though the two technologies are kind of different.

750
00:56:05,998 --> 00:56:09,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, certainly you get the games like Just Dance that they adapt for both.

751
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you'll still see a lot of stuff like that.

752
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's doing well, though.

753
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think so.

754
00:56:13,762 --> 00:56:14,823
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyhow, let's move on.

755
00:56:15,203 --> 00:56:17,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about other releases and things coming out.

756
00:56:18,064 --> 00:56:23,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Another fighting game is going to be repackaged with all the download content, and you might have heard, it is Mortal Kombat.

757
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:29,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Mortal Kombat Complete Edition, of course, complete with a K, is coming out all over again.

758
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:34,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to have the original game, all of the DLC packs, so including Freddy.

759
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:38,292
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have Mortal Kombat, songs inspired by the Warriors.

760
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:39,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that that old-ass...

761
00:56:40,553 --> 00:56:42,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might be.

762
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:44,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it might be the new one.

763
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:44,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

764
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:46,256
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a new soundtrack.

765
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:48,698
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's that old CD, that's awesome.

766
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:49,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

767
00:56:50,399 --> 00:57:00,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you get a download code of the 1995 Mortal Kombat film, which was decent for a video game movie because a lot of them aren't very good.

768
00:57:00,144 --> 00:57:02,365
[SPEAKER_07]: But the original Mortal Kombat movie was kind of awesome.

769
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:02,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It was alright.

770
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the sequel was bad.

771
00:57:04,947 --> 00:57:06,067
[SPEAKER_07]: The sequel was bad.

772
00:57:06,087 --> 00:57:07,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really bad.

773
00:57:07,428 --> 00:57:07,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

774
00:57:07,628 --> 00:57:08,950
[SPEAKER_06]: The TV show was even worse.

775
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there ever a third movie?

776
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:12,455
[SPEAKER_07]: There was talk about a third movie, but they just never did it.

777
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're still doing it.

778
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:15,199
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little late now.

779
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:20,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now that the whole resurgence, I guess there was those YouTube videos that really weren't bad.

780
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:29,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyhow, it is coming out on February 28th, the Mortal Kombat Complete Edition, both on the 360 and the PlayStation 3.

781
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:35,184
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you're like me and you never downloaded any of the DLC, this may be of value to you.

782
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:35,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

783
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:37,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably won't get it.

784
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:43,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need the 1995 film that bad, and the DLC, if I want it, I can probably download cheaper.

785
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:44,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask yourself, do you like renting stuff?

786
00:57:46,688 --> 00:57:46,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you?

787
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:48,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, do you guys like renting stuff?

788
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Warner Brothers says, fuck you, because they don't like people that rent ship.

789
00:57:53,935 --> 00:57:55,996
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to push the window out to 56 days.

790
00:57:56,597 --> 00:58:01,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I wonder if there's going to be the online pass.

791
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:02,942
[SPEAKER_07]: For listeners that don't know, explain the...

792
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:32,254
[SPEAKER_06]: 56 day window basically Warner Brothers right now they had implemented a 28 day window to basically block anybody that rents movies from buying directly from them if they want to buy stuff to put in their store they have to go out to Walmart or retail or Amazon or wherever and buy them and put them on well technically they could sell you the product directly later on but you know it's

793
00:58:32,814 --> 00:58:40,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's a 56-day window, and so Netflix is not going to have it until 56 days later.

794
00:58:41,678 --> 00:58:49,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But Redbox, they're like, well, fuck it, we're just going to go buy it at the store, as is Blockbuster.

795
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:53,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Blockbuster, those are the big three that were kind of affected by it.

796
00:58:53,943 --> 00:59:12,292
[SPEAKER_06]: and also you know you may like your Harry Potter well as of you know last year at the end of the last year they're all out of circulation now they're they took all the movies out of circulation so they can go re-release them like Disney does basically Warner hates people fucking 3D they're gonna release all the Harry Potter movies in 3D wait for it well it wasn't the

797
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:17,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Warner Brothers fucking hates people that do not buy their movies.

798
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:26,779
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to basically take everybody out of rental to buy their stuff and to stream their stuff using their ultraviolet service is what they're looking to do.

799
00:59:28,259 --> 00:59:32,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Which isn't going to work because they're diluting it out there.

800
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,702
[SPEAKER_07]: All these companies think they can build their own Netflix.

801
00:59:34,762 --> 00:59:35,623
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not going to work.

802
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:40,505
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's the kind of thing you want to support, then by all means...

803
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:44,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when this shit was going on with VHS movies.

804
00:59:44,402 --> 00:59:46,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Video stores would get it before everybody else.

805
00:59:46,062 --> 00:59:49,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, Ranma, you're talking about the reverse.

806
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:11,835
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about the total reverse.

807
01:00:12,156 --> 01:00:19,461
[SPEAKER_07]: What used to happen then, I used to work at a video store way back when, those VHS tapes used to cost like $99 when they first came out.

808
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:20,122
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why.

809
01:00:20,262 --> 01:00:22,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It was rental and sell-through.

810
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:34,533
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically had rental movies would come out at one point, then eventually the studio would drop the price to sell-through because, I mean, yeah, you can go buy the movie the same day that it comes to the rental stores, but it's going to cost you $100 or $150 to buy that movie.

811
01:00:34,553 --> 01:00:34,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

812
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:38,957
[SPEAKER_06]: But then they had programs.

813
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Warner's tried a bunch of things.

814
01:00:41,878 --> 01:00:44,540
[SPEAKER_06]: They've tried distributing their own movies and that didn't work.

815
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,180
[SPEAKER_06]: They tried these programs.

816
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:50,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, working in the distribution business, it's fun.

817
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:52,824
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on, Alan.

818
01:00:54,324 --> 01:01:03,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Mad Catz has released the latest line of the Fight Stick controllers they're putting out for Capcom's Street Fighter X Tekken.

819
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,791
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done a redesign of it.

820
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:11,174
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two different models now, the Fight Stick Pro and the Arcade Fight Stick Versus Edition.

821
01:01:11,754 --> 01:01:18,178
[SPEAKER_05]: The latter, which aside from having, I think, more detailed art on the top panel of it,

822
01:01:18,938 --> 01:01:44,351
[SPEAKER_05]: is a there is it comes with an accessory if you have two of them you can snap them together and basically make a mock like arcade board where you have two people standing side by side like they were fighting at a real arcade in case you want to sit a little closer to your friend yeah so if you can find a way to get like a table and put this up up there you can then have two people for like for you know tournaments that you want to host

823
01:01:47,633 --> 01:01:49,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Get you to buy two of them instead of one.

824
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:50,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

825
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:59,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also going to be a Fight Pad SD, which is going to be 15% smaller roughly than the previous Fight Pads that they've put out.

826
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:06,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't have a price point or release date yet for either of these products, whether it be the new Fight Pad or the Arcade Sticks.

827
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: but they are aiming for a to be congruous with the March 6th release of the game itself and I have a little side story about this all right I remember in February of 09 when Street Fighter 4 came out not Super Street Fighter 4 but the original one I wanted one of the fight pads Mad Catz and I have it right here Rob if you could hand that to me

828
01:02:32,256 --> 01:02:32,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid so much for this.

829
01:02:59,494 --> 01:03:09,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever I hear that Capcom keeps giving MadCatz their exclusive license for the fight sticks and the arcade whatever, I'm like, MadCatz products suck.

830
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:13,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But that just happens.

831
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:14,793
[SPEAKER_05]: The stuff comes dead out of the box.

832
01:03:14,813 --> 01:03:16,515
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be anything.

833
01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:19,066
[SPEAKER_05]: He's mad, damn it.

834
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:23,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, Loki, before I throw it out, if you want to fuck with it, it's here.

835
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,213
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to take it home and open it, I don't know.

836
01:03:26,633 --> 01:03:27,133
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all.

837
01:03:27,714 --> 01:03:28,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, fix it.

838
01:03:28,655 --> 01:03:28,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

839
01:03:29,676 --> 01:03:31,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Techmaster Loki.

840
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:32,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Read between the lines.

841
01:03:32,078 --> 01:03:33,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Techmaster Loki, fix it.

842
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:36,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the thingy?

843
01:03:36,673 --> 01:03:37,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's evaluating it.

844
01:03:37,774 --> 01:03:41,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first off, you're missing the breakaway part of the cable here.

845
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

846
01:03:43,901 --> 01:03:48,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, yeah, just go to Kotaku or Joystick if you want to see what the fight sticks look like.

847
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:50,087
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

848
01:03:50,788 --> 01:03:51,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to release dates.

849
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:55,133
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to travel the world and check out some upcoming releases coming soon.

850
01:03:55,868 --> 01:03:56,849
[SPEAKER_07]: to a game store near you.

851
01:04:22,685 --> 01:04:42,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you like Gran Turismo and I hope they haven't bought Gran Turismo 5 because that's really that's all coming out this week Gran Turismo 5 again yes Gran Turismo 5 XL edition it includes now this is kind of cool it includes all the well the spec 2.0 update and a voucher for $20 worth of DLC and it's only 40 bucks

852
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:44,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's cool.

853
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:45,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it's not bad.

854
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:51,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I am terrible at, like, Gran Turismo and the realistic racers, but that's a good deal.

855
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:51,691
[SPEAKER_07]: That's neat.

856
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's not bad.

857
01:04:53,011 --> 01:04:55,891
[SPEAKER_06]: And My Pet Puppy 3D for the 3DS from 505 Games.

858
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:57,012
[SPEAKER_06]: That is it.

859
01:04:57,232 --> 01:04:57,912
[SPEAKER_04]: My Pet Puppy!

860
01:04:58,092 --> 01:04:58,492
[SPEAKER_06]: It was funny.

861
01:04:58,552 --> 01:05:01,432
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, there was actually supposed to be games coming out, but nothing came out.

862
01:05:01,592 --> 01:05:02,533
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a dead week.

863
01:05:02,973 --> 01:05:03,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

864
01:05:03,593 --> 01:05:05,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what do you mean games were supposed to come out and then they didn't?

865
01:05:05,353 --> 01:05:06,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, a bunch of delayed stuff?

866
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:09,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was two games that were supposed to come out this week, and both of them got delayed.

867
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:09,454
[SPEAKER_06]: What games?

868
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:16,336
[SPEAKER_06]: This week was supposed to be 4-1 Action Pack from South Peak or something like that.

869
01:05:16,356 --> 01:05:18,636
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch of really terrible PlayStation Network games.

870
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:24,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was the National Geographic Challenge, which got delayed to the 24th.

871
01:05:24,177 --> 01:05:28,198
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm thinking even if those games were coming out, you would have said this week was uneventful.

872
01:05:28,218 --> 01:05:28,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying.

873
01:05:29,499 --> 01:05:29,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

874
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:31,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, going to Japan.

875
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:38,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick though, one release I wanted to say that's not on this list because it's an Xbox Live thing.

876
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:47,807
[SPEAKER_06]: DLC for Saints Row the Third, the first in the season pass, it will be released this week, Genki Bowl 7, which I am excited to play.

877
01:05:48,940 --> 01:06:15,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move to the Japanese release dates Which are a little more exciting on the Xbox 360 to start us off Dead Rising 2 gets a price reduction in Japan I think some folks may be excited about this Onichanbara Z Kagura comes out this week in Japan So I think this is like a sequel to the original Onichanbara Which if you didn't know what that game was It's basically women with big titties slaying zombies It is a woman wearing lingerie and a cowboy hat With a samurai sword killing zombies That's right

878
01:06:16,441 --> 01:06:37,928
[SPEAKER_06]: and how like in other words the formula for a perfect game yet it doesn't end up on any end of the year best list it's not really yeah it's kind of one of those on paper it sounded awesome it's it's part of the simple series the simple series had a really weird they had a lineup of games that was just so up some of them were just like casual games some of them were really weird

879
01:06:38,688 --> 01:06:42,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Earth Defense Force was part of the simple series in Japan on the PlayStation 2.

880
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,071
[SPEAKER_06]: This was also part of the series.

881
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:49,495
[SPEAKER_06]: One that I wish that would come over here or at least make a sequel to is Zombies vs. Ambulance.

882
01:06:49,775 --> 01:06:52,437
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an ambulance and you run over zombies with the ambulance.

883
01:06:52,757 --> 01:06:58,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also had another one that was like some chicks in dresses maids with like mini guns killing zombies.

884
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,621
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of zombie killing.

885
01:07:01,922 --> 01:07:03,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I like games that are over the top.

886
01:07:03,443 --> 01:07:04,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't we get more of them?

887
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:04,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just ridiculous.

888
01:07:04,964 --> 01:07:07,846
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I thought Saints Row was really awesome actually.

889
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:14,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Power Up Heroes and Red Dead Redemption Complete Edition.

890
01:07:14,746 --> 01:07:16,888
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those coming out on January 19th.

891
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:20,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, some of the same stuff.

892
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:23,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead Rising 2, Red Dead Redemption Complete Edition, getting the price reductions.

893
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:27,017
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some new things this week, including Nobunaga no Yabu Tendo.

894
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:29,078
[SPEAKER_07]: That is actually, again, a price reduction.

895
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:32,181
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as Trinity Zil-O-Zero.

896
01:07:32,461 --> 01:07:35,004
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those games I just mentioned, PlayStation 3 best hits.

897
01:07:35,504 --> 01:07:43,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Next big release for Japan on PlayStation 3 is probably Armored Core 5 but that's on the 26th so you still have a little ways to go before that is out.

898
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:49,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind the PlayStation Vita is already out in Japan so they are getting this week Wipeout 2048 on the Vita.

899
01:07:49,554 --> 01:07:50,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes its way to Japan this week.

900
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that's a launch title for us over here.

901
01:07:54,257 --> 01:08:16,552
[SPEAKER_07]: the Wii really doesn't have a lot there's a price reduction of Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes and I'm quickly looking to see if the PSP or no 3DS Labyrinth no Kanata and Rhythm Kaito R Kotei Napoleon no Isan comes out from Sega this week trying to see if that's a that's Rhythm Thief I believe

902
01:08:17,392 --> 01:08:17,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

903
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's Treasure.

904
01:08:21,354 --> 01:08:22,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Japanese version of that.

905
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:25,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And Runabout 3D Drive Impossible.

906
01:08:25,276 --> 01:08:26,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of a bigger week of 3DS.

907
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:28,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, hold on a second.

908
01:08:28,557 --> 01:08:29,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's that from?

909
01:08:29,578 --> 01:08:30,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Rocket Company?

910
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:33,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Runabout 3D Drive Impossible.

911
01:08:34,269 --> 01:08:34,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

912
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Runabout's fucking awesome.

913
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:37,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not heard of this series.

914
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:40,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Runabout's been around since the original PlayStation.

915
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out over here as Felony 179.

916
01:08:42,398 --> 01:08:48,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's basically a game where you drive around and smash into stuff with your car and cause damage.

917
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:50,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I can see that from the screenshots.

918
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like you can drive a tank in one of them.

919
01:08:54,048 --> 01:08:54,829
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty fun game.

920
01:08:55,389 --> 01:08:56,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

921
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't give it another second thought.

922
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:58,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

923
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:00,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Yuki in our chatroom says, I thought it was a Dreamcast game.

924
01:09:00,851 --> 01:09:03,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, that could be a delay.

925
01:09:03,813 --> 01:09:05,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yuki might be commenting on another game we mentioned.

926
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Runabout was also a Dreamcast game, I believe, as well.

927
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,856
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Dreamcast and PlayStation 1.

928
01:09:12,396 --> 01:09:13,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe PlayStation 2.

929
01:09:13,957 --> 01:09:15,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really simple graphics.

930
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:17,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it comes back in 3D this week.

931
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:19,299
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's PlayStation 1, for sure.

932
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with the UK releases.

933
01:09:23,021 --> 01:09:23,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Two games.

934
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:29,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday the 18th we're going to get Haunt for the 360 and Scary Girl for the 360.

935
01:09:30,048 --> 01:09:32,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Which are download titles.

936
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:34,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Boring week over there in the UK.

937
01:09:34,812 --> 01:09:36,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you enjoy what you got already.

938
01:09:36,394 --> 01:09:40,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And Scary Girl I guess is a graphic novel tie-in and it's a Squeenix produced game.

939
01:09:41,013 --> 01:09:42,674
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fighting game, I believe.

940
01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:46,357
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm not mistaken, Haunt is a Nana Onsha game.

941
01:09:46,918 --> 01:09:48,279
[SPEAKER_07]: The folks that made Parappa the Rapper.

942
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't expect it to be a music game.

943
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not a music game.

944
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:56,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Scary Girl was a fighting game.

945
01:09:56,185 --> 01:09:59,327
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was some other fighting game that was coming out that was like that.

946
01:10:00,248 --> 01:10:01,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It might not have been Scary Girl, I don't remember.

947
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:02,630
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

948
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:20,723
[SPEAKER_06]: and Kid Icarus is going to be supporting that as well.

949
01:10:20,743 --> 01:10:27,127
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be getting a left-handed mode with the Circle Pad Pro which looks kind of awkward.

950
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:28,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how that would be holding that.

951
01:10:29,269 --> 01:10:34,993
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, now I'm really pissed off that that Circle Pad Pro thing is a GameStop exclusive because Alan's left-handed.

952
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:42,218
[SPEAKER_07]: He could actually use that because I'll probably buy that game and he could kind of use that mode but I'm not going to GameStop, period.

953
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

954
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

955
01:11:02,246 --> 01:11:19,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard on your hands anyway, so they're going to be coming out with a stand, if you will, for the 3DS that will be included with Kickerous Uprising, because apparently the game is so uncomfortable to play on the 3DS it requires a stand, making it not really a portable system anymore, but...

956
01:11:20,896 --> 01:11:25,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, apparently touching the screen works better if it's secured, according to Nintendo.

957
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:28,561
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird.

958
01:11:29,122 --> 01:11:32,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird to bundle a peripheral like that with Kid Icarus.

959
01:11:32,444 --> 01:11:35,706
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that screams design flaw right there.

960
01:11:35,886 --> 01:11:37,987
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to be getting a new 3DS to C3.

961
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:38,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what it is.

962
01:11:38,688 --> 01:11:43,931
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because you have to touch the screen or whatever, and it just doesn't work.

963
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:49,455
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've played even Metroid Prime, 3D Hunters or whatever it was,

964
01:11:50,896 --> 01:12:17,695
[SPEAKER_06]: The original DS Kind of had that same type of setup Where you would move with the directional pad And you used your right hand with the stylus To kind of look around And it was fucking uncomfortable to play that game So this, kind of the same thing But now you use an analog stick instead It would be easier if you could aim Like if you had the Circle Pad Pro Aim with the right analog And move with the left And then you wouldn't need the touch screen But then what's the point?

965
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:22,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Alan, you've had your share of challenges with the 3DS.

966
01:12:22,481 --> 01:12:23,765
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about some of this news?

967
01:12:26,441 --> 01:12:27,862
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get it, I'll use it.

968
01:12:28,322 --> 01:12:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

969
01:12:29,603 --> 01:12:31,964
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just not that excited about the 3DS to begin with?

970
01:12:32,184 --> 01:12:32,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

971
01:12:34,565 --> 01:12:37,827
[SPEAKER_05]: When they release the second generation of the hardware, I will give a shit.

972
01:12:38,727 --> 01:12:42,309
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm a late adopter on purpose with Nintendo.

973
01:12:42,349 --> 01:12:46,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm holding my 3DS right now with one hand, kind of moving the analog stick.

974
01:12:47,512 --> 01:12:49,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Even just holding it for a few seconds is uncomfortable.

975
01:12:50,553 --> 01:12:56,199
[SPEAKER_06]: and pushing on the screen as well as I'm trying to it really starts to put a kink in my wrist there.

976
01:12:56,539 --> 01:13:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think they would have to come up with some better way of doing that.

977
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:33,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart is the biggest culprit because you have to hold down the accelerator and that makes my hand cramp really bad after like one track other games on the 3DS or like the purely stylus based ones are fine I will bet you anything the next 3DS we get is going to be an XL because the problem right now is everyone is saying it's too small and it cramps people's hands up that they're going to make it bigger so they can put the extra analog stick on there and it'll be an XL system I will bet you

978
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,803
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

979
01:13:35,864 --> 01:13:37,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, moving on.

980
01:13:37,806 --> 01:13:39,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Mario Kart, sort of.

981
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:46,815
[SPEAKER_07]: An interesting new game hit the iPhone, iOS, iTouch, and all that store this week.

982
01:13:47,275 --> 01:13:48,597
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Mole Kart.

983
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:56,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's kind of common these days that you see these iOS games that are very similar to games that are out there.

984
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:57,886
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, you might remember last week...

985
01:13:58,306 --> 01:14:19,900
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about kind of the same subject With Atari going after all these people Well, Nintendo may want to consider going after this game Because what makes it unique is that While they don't use Mario And that a lot of the characters are different A lot of the tracks are lifted right out of Mario Kart A lot of them, all of them

986
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:23,161
[SPEAKER_07]: All of them are taken right from Mario Kart.

987
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:28,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the whole bouncy mushroom race thing that was huge on the Wii is in there.

988
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:30,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you played this, Loki.

989
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:32,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't even bothered to play it, but you actually got it.

990
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:34,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I got it.

991
01:14:35,108 --> 01:14:36,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bought it.

992
01:14:37,809 --> 01:14:40,611
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yes, it's a complete rip-off of Mario Kart.

993
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:49,496
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing, though, see, I don't like, once again, I don't like kart racers on the iPod because I just don't like tilt controls.

994
01:14:49,956 --> 01:14:50,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It really pisses me off.

995
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:53,918
[SPEAKER_06]: But even, I mean, look at even the main screen here.

996
01:14:53,978 --> 01:14:58,080
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a complete ripoff of the bomb in the corner there.

997
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Item mode, they call it.

998
01:14:59,781 --> 01:15:01,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, they break it up.

999
01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:03,682
[SPEAKER_06]: You start off with two characters.

1000
01:15:03,702 --> 01:15:07,403
[SPEAKER_06]: You can unlock two more by playing the game, and you can buy two more on top of that.

1001
01:15:07,863 --> 01:15:10,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, you get Mole Man and some bear.

1002
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:22,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyways, the different things that they have starting off, you have the Mole Pasture, which I want to say it's one of the tracks from the Wii game.

1003
01:15:23,046 --> 01:15:23,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember its...

1004
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:24,566
[SPEAKER_06]: X Mushroom

1005
01:15:32,868 --> 01:15:35,189
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely one of the tracks from the game.

1006
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:43,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can unlock the Frigé port, which is definitely one of the tracks from the Wii game.

1007
01:15:43,774 --> 01:15:53,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Volcano, which is one of the old classic tracks, the Bowser Castle tracks from the Super Nintendo game that they remade the 3D in the Wii version that's in there.

1008
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky Remnant is another track that I think you can buy.

1009
01:15:59,122 --> 01:15:59,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1010
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:15,350
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Arctic Glaciers is the ice track from Nintendo 64 version that was up-res and then Mole's Garden was Peach's, I think it's Peach's Garden or something like that or Daisy's Garden.

1011
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, it's a damn rip-off.

1012
01:16:16,652 --> 01:16:18,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, everything's a rip-off.

1013
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:30,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So rather than being just, it's the same genre, because last week you were saying that companies go after third-party things that say, oh, you're copying our game, but it's like, no, it's just the same genre.

1014
01:16:30,454 --> 01:16:31,355
[SPEAKER_06]: They copy the tracks.

1015
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,315
[SPEAKER_06]: The tracks are the same.

1016
01:16:32,435 --> 01:16:33,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be a valid lawsuit.

1017
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:34,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1018
01:16:34,976 --> 01:16:39,318
[SPEAKER_06]: All the power-ups are, you know, oh, this is not quite a bullet bill.

1019
01:16:39,378 --> 01:16:41,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something different, but all the power-ups are the same.

1020
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:42,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have all the power-ups.

1021
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But doesn't the quality of stuff like this kind of speak for itself?

1022
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:46,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not bad.

1023
01:16:47,162 --> 01:16:48,925
[SPEAKER_06]: SmurfsVillageMolesWorld

1024
01:16:59,005 --> 01:16:59,925
[SPEAKER_07]: How the hell do I play this?

1025
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:02,126
[SPEAKER_06]: It's automatic acceleration.

1026
01:17:02,146 --> 01:17:03,726
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a break, and then you tilt to move.

1027
01:17:04,346 --> 01:17:05,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I just move backwards.

1028
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:07,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I hold your mic up to your face for you?

1029
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:08,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, hold it.

1030
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:09,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

1031
01:17:09,128 --> 01:17:09,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing.

1032
01:17:10,948 --> 01:17:12,208
[SPEAKER_07]: This game is kind of basic.

1033
01:17:12,248 --> 01:17:13,469
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I use it?

1034
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:14,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you tap the item.

1035
01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:16,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you tap the item, too.

1036
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:26,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I just got a flaming pear as a power-up, and there's cows standing in the middle of the course, just like on the Wii one.

1037
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:50,767
[SPEAKER_07]: and the flaming pears I'm assuming are like the mushroom yeah because it gave me a little turbo boost and I can't drive for shit this game I mean it's one of those things where it's like I would show my friends haha look at this Mario Kart ripoff but I mean is it really worth what is this a pineapple okay it's an oh it's the it's the use it all you want nitro the frame rate on this sucks

1038
01:17:52,771 --> 01:18:11,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Moomoo Meadows it's even on the fucking banner it says Moomoo Meadows on the fucking banner you know I'm thinking the developers kind of forgot that you might want to change some things that are on the track way to go

1039
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:13,772
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1040
01:18:37,472 --> 01:18:38,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, that's fantastic.

1041
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:54,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because you know, you know they're doing it in some, you know, very tiny cubicle, high production supervisor glaring down everyone's necks environment where they just, just take this track and copy it, you know, just bit by bit, detail by detail.

1042
01:18:54,984 --> 01:18:56,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they copied it.

1043
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:00,114
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fantastic.

1044
01:19:00,555 --> 01:19:01,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

1045
01:19:02,355 --> 01:19:05,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's take a moment to take a trek down memory lane.

1046
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:08,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when the only game that was getting ripped off was Street Fighter 2?

1047
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:10,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Fighting Street?

1048
01:19:11,158 --> 01:19:12,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a trip down memory lane.

1049
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:15,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember in the groove.

1050
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1051
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:23,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week, DarkSakura likes to dive into the vault and pick a game that she thinks is worthy of being the classic game of the week.

1052
01:19:23,102 --> 01:19:23,802
[SPEAKER_07]: But she's not here.

1053
01:19:24,503 --> 01:19:27,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of the classic gaming vault, we have the classic gaming cardboard box.

1054
01:19:29,162 --> 01:19:36,712
[SPEAKER_07]: and Alan has dived in, thumb first, into the Classic Gaming box and pulled out a game that he thinks, hey, shows some respect.

1055
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:38,253
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a true classic right here.

1056
01:19:38,934 --> 01:19:40,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, what is the Classic Game of the Week this week?

1057
01:19:41,858 --> 01:19:44,882
[SPEAKER_05]: This week's Classic Game is the original Half-Life.

1058
01:19:46,266 --> 01:19:47,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so surprised.

1059
01:19:47,306 --> 01:19:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Release 1998.

1060
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:49,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so surprised at this coming from you.

1061
01:19:50,047 --> 01:19:50,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I know.

1062
01:19:51,588 --> 01:19:57,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's never been a classic game of the week, and reality check, this game is, what, 13 years old at this point?

1063
01:19:57,889 --> 01:19:58,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1064
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:08,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Half-Life was made by two former Microsoft employees, Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell, whose name might ring a few bells.

1065
01:20:09,593 --> 01:20:14,134
[SPEAKER_05]: They bought the package to modify the Quake engine.

1066
01:20:15,454 --> 01:20:44,217
[SPEAKER_05]: and they hacked the shit out of it to design this game and by the time they were done the Quake engine had grown into something called Gold Source which is how Source which was the big engine that Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead is based off of that's how they got that name so the original Half-Life was a modified Quake engine game it was published by believe it or not Sierra Entertainment or what Sierra Online had become before it finally closed after they made all the King's Quest and Space Quest games

1067
01:20:44,778 --> 01:20:46,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, developed by Valve.

1068
01:20:47,604 --> 01:20:49,047
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a little company you might have heard of.

1069
01:20:50,289 --> 01:20:52,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Published by Sierra Online and it was released...

1070
01:20:54,193 --> 01:20:58,217
[SPEAKER_05]: November 19th of 1998 on the Windows PC platform.

1071
01:20:59,258 --> 01:21:11,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, anyone who remembers the 90s know that as far as first-person shooters go, there were the two big titles, Wolfenstein 3D, which set the place for Doom, which set the place for Duke Nukem 3D.

1072
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:15,093
[SPEAKER_05]: What Half-Life did differently and how...

1073
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:17,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the par time.

1074
01:21:17,389 --> 01:21:17,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's your time.

1075
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:18,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1076
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:43,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Half-Life was just like a big... I mean, it just kept going and going.

1077
01:21:43,143 --> 01:21:55,090
[SPEAKER_05]: There were little chapter marks, so when you got to a certain plot point in the game and you uncovered a new area, a subtitle would say, you know, Chapter 2, Office Complex, so you know that you're progressing through the story.

1078
01:21:55,491 --> 01:21:57,272
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, it was like a big ant farm.

1079
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:06,157
[SPEAKER_05]: You were in Black Mesa, which was a military, industrial, private firm that made, like, nuclear weapons for the government.

1080
01:22:06,938 --> 01:22:07,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1081
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:25,488
[SPEAKER_05]: in Arizona, and you play Gordon Freeman, a physicist who is doing an experiment on some alien moon rock that is given to him in strange circumstances, and when he does a test on it, a dimensional rip from an alien world, a hostile alien world, opens in.

1082
01:22:26,656 --> 01:22:34,704
[SPEAKER_05]: All these aliens pour out and it turns out that they were working on portal technology, like the game Portal, which came much later.

1083
01:22:36,026 --> 01:22:45,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And while developing this portal stuff, they accidentally tapped into an evil alien overworld and critters showed up.

1084
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:48,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, it's Critters!

1085
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the best-rated first-person shooters of all time.

1086
01:22:53,921 --> 01:22:56,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's got a 97 or 98 on Metacritic.

1087
01:22:58,402 --> 01:23:11,626
[SPEAKER_05]: The other big thing, which was unprecedented at the time, was that the Marine soldiers that come in in Chapter 4 or 5 to kill you, they actually had an AI, believe it or not.

1088
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:15,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the demons in Doom and the aliens in Duke Nukem 3D were pretty...

1089
01:23:15,647 --> 01:23:19,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Dumb, you know, you could hide behind cover, you just run out and shoot them.

1090
01:23:20,571 --> 01:23:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: In Half-Life, if you ducked for cover, the computer would know to tell the NPCs to then throw a grenade, and the aiming on the grenade was accurate, so you'd be hiding behind a box or around a corner, and you would see a grenade, and it's like, oh, shit, and no one had ever played a game that hard before, where you had to actually think about how to go about killing your enemies.

1091
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:49,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Half-Life was also very different where there wasn't really multiplayer, which was really big in that day.

1092
01:23:49,977 --> 01:23:52,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was there co-op?

1093
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It came later.

1094
01:23:53,281 --> 01:23:59,188
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Half-Life Deathmatch and also Counter-Strike, which is the biggest.

1095
01:23:59,629 --> 01:24:03,694
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also a hack of the Gold Source engine when Valve opened up.

1096
01:24:03,854 --> 01:24:04,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1097
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:23,212
[SPEAKER_05]: The opening of Half-Life is Gordon Freeman getting into the tram.

1098
01:24:24,873 --> 01:24:25,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the morning.

1099
01:24:25,573 --> 01:24:26,734
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to his day at work.

1100
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:30,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't really get to control your character at all.

1101
01:24:30,235 --> 01:24:35,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about a two or three minute intro where you're just on this tram going through the Black Mesa facility.

1102
01:24:36,178 --> 01:24:37,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it's kind of doing is showing you...

1103
01:24:38,499 --> 01:24:39,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1104
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:16,130
[SPEAKER_05]: the designer of Bioshock if you remember the intro of Bioshock where you the plane crash lands and you're in the water and you go into the lighthouse and you're in the bathysphere and you see Rapture the City that is inspired by the tram sequence in Half-Life it's exactly a direct homage to what Half-Life did

1105
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:20,972
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a few flaws, of course, with Half-Life.

1106
01:25:21,272 --> 01:25:23,593
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a lot of bullshit weapons in it that you never use.

1107
01:25:23,634 --> 01:25:24,874
[SPEAKER_05]: There were like 15 different weapons.

1108
01:25:25,014 --> 01:25:26,255
[SPEAKER_05]: You only needed like five of them.

1109
01:25:27,195 --> 01:25:35,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Way too long, especially since the last chapter of the game, you go to the alien world to kill the big brain fetus.

1110
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: That part was really ugly and it had a lot of first-person platforming where you have to jump on shit or else you fall off and die.

1111
01:25:45,684 --> 01:25:51,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Even today, in 2012, you put jumping puzzles in a first-person shooter, people are like, fuck, no, this is stupid.

1112
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:51,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to do this.

1113
01:25:52,227 --> 01:25:56,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Half-Life, near the end of its cycle, had a ton of that stuff.

1114
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:58,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't without its flaws.

1115
01:26:00,291 --> 01:26:27,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's also one of the as far as PC exclusive shooters the best selling this may not be true any longer but there was a point where if you bought a new sound card you got a free copy of Half-Life if you bought a graphics card or a new computer like you go to Circuit City and you get the package deal well now it's download Steam and Half-Life will cost 50 cents at some point so an absurd amount of millions of units sold in this game

1116
01:26:28,599 --> 01:26:56,167
[SPEAKER_05]: and Half-Life 2 of course came out in 2004 launched the Steam store platform which of course no one knew at the time what the fuck that was and now Steam is totally integral to PC gaming and without any of this we would have never had Portal or Portal 2 our game of the year this last year Aperture Science which is the main company and Portal is hinted at as being in bidding wars with the government against Black Mesa

1117
01:26:57,267 --> 01:27:03,290
[SPEAKER_05]: and always losing so they're kind of like the shitty little kid brother of Black Mesa anything else you want to say about Half-Life?

1118
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:24,541
[SPEAKER_05]: it's awesome I do a full playthrough of it at least once or twice a year it's hard as hell I can't honestly beat it without using a god mode code for at least some parts of it but it's definitely awesome and if you like first person shooters you want to know what all the hype is about when people lose their shit about where is Half-Life 3 god damn it

1119
01:27:24,941 --> 01:27:29,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Play this and figure out, oh, okay, I can see why I'd want more of this.

1120
01:27:29,446 --> 01:27:32,329
[SPEAKER_05]: But do keep in mind the game is 12 years old at this point.

1121
01:27:32,429 --> 01:27:32,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1122
01:27:34,076 --> 01:28:00,659
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's been newer versions there's a fan community project that's pretty much vaporware called Black Mesa Source which was, it's not related to Valve at all but Valve has absolutely given it it's given them their blessing a complete reskin of Half-Life with completely redrawn textures like a total remake of it that hasn't come out yet and it's been planned for like 5 or 6 years

1123
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:01,822
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1124
01:28:02,383 --> 01:28:04,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week this week.

1125
01:28:04,604 --> 01:28:08,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Half-Life, released originally in 98 for the PC.

1126
01:28:08,508 --> 01:28:09,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your crowbars.

1127
01:28:09,508 --> 01:28:09,748
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1128
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:12,110
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1129
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:15,973
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a quick break, guys, but we'll be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1130
01:28:16,013 --> 01:28:16,934
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still more to come.

1131
01:28:16,954 --> 01:28:21,978
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got some rapid-fire news coming your way, FUs of the Week, the mailbag, and more announcements and things of that sort.

1132
01:28:22,358 --> 01:28:23,219
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't go anywhere, guys.

1133
01:28:23,239 --> 01:28:26,702
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1134
01:28:33,115 --> 01:28:35,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1135
01:28:36,018 --> 01:28:44,085
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live on this January the 15th of 2012 with the 442nd episode of our program.

1136
01:28:44,145 --> 01:28:48,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course we are taping live as we always do every week at All Games Radio.

1137
01:28:48,528 --> 01:28:53,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Blackwolf.

1138
01:28:53,553 --> 01:28:54,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've talked a lot in...

1139
01:28:55,214 --> 01:28:56,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Diablo 3, Mortal Kombat Complete Edition

1140
01:29:24,814 --> 01:29:25,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1141
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:46,111
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1142
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:04,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Umlautsf.com

1143
01:30:25,124 --> 01:30:49,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I do ask if you are going to watch the hour and a half long pre-show for about the first 20 minutes just skip all the segments to have me until about 20 minutes in because unfortunately there was some audio snafu and I think I have a Jessica Simpson moment but you know what it's live things like that happen we've had our share of LOL WTF moments here on Orange Lounge Radio like remember when the entire soundboard fell over that was a good time

1144
01:30:49,759 --> 01:30:55,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyhow, big thanks once again to Umlaut for asking me to be a part of that, including, of course, the wonderful Seg, who I think is in our chat room.

1145
01:30:55,544 --> 01:30:56,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw him there earlier.

1146
01:30:56,304 --> 01:30:56,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Seg.

1147
01:30:57,385 --> 01:31:14,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other guys that put the pre-show together, the whole folks at the AV Society, very professional folks, and my fellow co-hosts on that show, Carnage and Wes, both from Destructoid, were great and did very well with all the interviews and everything.

1148
01:31:14,258 --> 01:31:15,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So lots and lots of interviews and folks.

1149
01:31:16,019 --> 01:31:16,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1150
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so again, that's YouTube user UmlautSF.

1151
01:31:19,622 --> 01:31:20,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, you can still donate.

1152
01:31:21,403 --> 01:31:26,626
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can still, if you forgot, if you're like, oops, I meant to donate, but you know, December was a rough month.

1153
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:28,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can still donate.

1154
01:31:28,547 --> 01:31:31,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think it'll go to this year's tally, but it will go to a good cause.

1155
01:31:31,669 --> 01:31:33,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the very important part.

1156
01:31:34,028 --> 01:31:34,208
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1157
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:35,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with some rapid fire news.

1158
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:38,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other game news going on there this week.

1159
01:31:38,413 --> 01:31:38,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1160
01:31:39,514 --> 01:31:39,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1161
01:31:40,475 --> 01:31:43,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's start things off talking a little bit about Saints Row the Third.

1162
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:44,820
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of cool.

1163
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:51,927
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that I know I heard about a while ago because it was announced by CheapAssGamer because it involves TPD.

1164
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:52,568
[SPEAKER_06]: But CheapAssGamer.

1165
01:31:52,628 --> 01:31:53,289
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1166
01:32:11,346 --> 01:32:13,728
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, have the season pass.

1167
01:32:14,049 --> 01:32:26,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can get it for free using the Genki Bowl 7 viewer pack, which allows you to get all the DLC portions to be able to play co-op with someone that has that DLC if you choose not to buy it.

1168
01:32:28,801 --> 01:32:37,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, the only catch is that you need to get to the point in the game where you're at the first save house, which doesn't take that long because that's when you get homies.

1169
01:32:37,069 --> 01:32:37,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh...

1170
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Even I'm at that point.

1171
01:32:40,711 --> 01:32:43,753
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could play that long, if a game could hold my attention that long, you could do it too.

1172
01:32:43,773 --> 01:32:47,315
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty awesome, and he does have a bunch of unique lines, apparently, in the game.

1173
01:32:48,676 --> 01:32:49,596
[SPEAKER_07]: We got popcorn over here?

1174
01:32:50,317 --> 01:32:50,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like popcorn?

1175
01:32:51,037 --> 01:32:52,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's plain popcorn, though.

1176
01:32:52,478 --> 01:32:52,818
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1177
01:32:53,118 --> 01:32:53,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gross.

1178
01:32:53,839 --> 01:32:54,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty bad popcorn.

1179
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I eat low-fat or the low-butter popcorn sometimes.

1180
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I couldn't find that at the store, so I have regular butter now.

1181
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,180
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1182
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow, that is plain.

1183
01:33:05,301 --> 01:33:06,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, apparently... You just sold the hell out of that.

1184
01:33:06,722 --> 01:33:12,206
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I heard about CheapyD, I think he won some type of auction thing and did all that.

1185
01:33:12,226 --> 01:33:12,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, maybe.

1186
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was like a charity thing.

1187
01:33:14,408 --> 01:33:17,169
[SPEAKER_07]: If I knew about that auction, I would have... He paid like $2,000.

1188
01:33:21,944 --> 01:33:26,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it made the news tonight because I think it might be kind of late breaking and I really apologize.

1189
01:33:26,687 --> 01:33:28,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like scanning over the upcoming stories.

1190
01:33:29,549 --> 01:33:42,156
[SPEAKER_07]: There's rumors going around about THQ that apparently they're in trouble right now and they're selling off or something about all of the projects coming out in 2014 for THQ have been canceled and they're trying to prepare the company to be sold.

1191
01:33:42,176 --> 01:33:44,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're in trouble.

1192
01:33:45,782 --> 01:33:46,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty good.

1193
01:33:46,783 --> 01:33:48,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, where does a rumor like that come from?

1194
01:33:49,045 --> 01:33:50,346
[SPEAKER_06]: An industry insider.

1195
01:33:50,466 --> 01:33:53,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know that, but who would make something like that up?

1196
01:33:53,888 --> 01:33:55,089
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a weird rumor to make up.

1197
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:57,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it still weighs off.

1198
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:57,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 2014.

1199
01:33:57,631 --> 01:33:59,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

1200
01:33:59,292 --> 01:34:01,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're just... Who are they going to be bought by?

1201
01:34:01,534 --> 01:34:01,594
[SPEAKER_06]: EA.

1202
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:05,318
[SPEAKER_07]: or Activision.

1203
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:06,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else?

1204
01:34:07,539 --> 01:34:09,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else buys up gaming companies?

1205
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:13,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see them going that way right now.

1206
01:34:14,544 --> 01:34:17,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, there's companies that have a worse time than they do.

1207
01:34:19,847 --> 01:34:20,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you get surprised.

1208
01:34:21,167 --> 01:34:21,708
[SPEAKER_06]: PopCap.

1209
01:34:22,228 --> 01:34:23,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did PopCap sell?

1210
01:34:23,308 --> 01:34:24,048
[SPEAKER_06]: They were doing great.

1211
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at Capcom.

1212
01:34:25,589 --> 01:34:26,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom didn't do that great.

1213
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:31,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, but I don't think that sold tons.

1214
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:33,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

1215
01:34:33,411 --> 01:34:35,091
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't really have any big games.

1216
01:34:35,691 --> 01:34:39,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Warner Brothers had Batman, so that helped, but they didn't have Batman.

1217
01:34:41,573 --> 01:34:42,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry Potter?

1218
01:34:42,413 --> 01:34:43,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego Harry Potter?

1219
01:34:44,634 --> 01:34:45,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1220
01:34:45,494 --> 01:34:46,134
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

1221
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:49,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and some other cool stuff.

1222
01:34:50,656 --> 01:34:51,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Souls.

1223
01:34:51,556 --> 01:34:55,458
[SPEAKER_06]: There's hopefully a chance that it'll be coming to PC.

1224
01:34:55,838 --> 01:34:59,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the admin for the Dark Souls

1225
01:35:02,294 --> 01:35:24,924
[SPEAKER_06]: They responded to a request for a PC version and basically said There's always a possibility to have games adapted on PC And the good news is Dark Souls is not a 100% typical console game So the option is possible Now to make things happen, let's say the demand has to be properly done Someone make a successful petition And so there is a petition right now, you can sign it

1226
01:35:25,564 --> 01:35:35,645
[SPEAKER_06]: it has currently around 37,000 signatures and if it hits some arbitrary number then maybe there'll be a Dark Souls PC game

1227
01:35:37,639 --> 01:35:37,899
[SPEAKER_06]: SILENT HILL

1228
01:36:02,761 --> 01:36:05,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, March 13th.

1229
01:36:05,323 --> 01:36:09,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the HD Collection will be coming out on March 6th.

1230
01:36:10,488 --> 01:36:13,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the Vita, Book of Memories will be coming out March 27th.

1231
01:36:15,212 --> 01:36:19,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a whole month full of Silent Hill, whether that be a good or bad thing.

1232
01:36:23,018 --> 01:36:23,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1233
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,702
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked a little bit about Silent Hill already earlier in the show.

1234
01:36:26,802 --> 01:36:27,463
[SPEAKER_07]: What, another movie too?

1235
01:36:27,483 --> 01:36:28,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't there supposed to be another movie?

1236
01:36:28,464 --> 01:36:31,227
[SPEAKER_06]: There's supposed to be another movie, but I mean... I thought they announced they were filming it.

1237
01:36:31,267 --> 01:36:32,509
[SPEAKER_06]: The movie wasn't terrible.

1238
01:36:32,549 --> 01:36:33,970
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one was alright.

1239
01:36:34,471 --> 01:36:35,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked the first movie.

1240
01:36:35,492 --> 01:36:35,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1241
01:36:35,992 --> 01:36:36,653
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

1242
01:36:37,154 --> 01:36:37,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Just...

1243
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:46,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, the last game that they put out was not very good, and this one I'm not sure if it's going to be very good either.

1244
01:36:46,744 --> 01:36:49,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if, was it Frozen Memories?

1245
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:51,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that one of the Wii?

1246
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:52,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that was any good either.

1247
01:36:53,447 --> 01:36:54,168
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot of running.

1248
01:36:55,789 --> 01:36:56,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

1249
01:36:57,990 --> 01:37:05,474
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't necessarily about video gaming, but it's about a game that influences a lot of shit in video gaming, and that is Dungeons & Dragons.

1250
01:37:06,074 --> 01:37:09,776
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some big news this week about Dungeons & Dragons that's a little bit controversial.

1251
01:37:11,577 --> 01:37:36,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Wizards of the Coast is working on a new edition of Dungeons & Dragons which is kind of weird to me in a way like it seems like they're pumping these out faster than versions of Google Chrome all of a sudden like wasn't the original version of D&D in the 70s and then they had one in the 80s or like no when did second edition was all the way in the 90s there was D&D and then there was a D&D remember there was advanced and then they consolidated those two brands so there was a tricky other version in there yeah okay

1252
01:37:37,348 --> 01:37:37,528
[SPEAKER_07]: D&D D&D D&D

1253
01:37:57,788 --> 01:37:59,389
[SPEAKER_07]: User input, quote,

1254
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:18,123
[SPEAKER_07]: In short, we want a game that is as simple or as complex as you please.

1255
01:38:18,523 --> 01:38:22,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's action focused on combat, intrigue, and exploration as you desire.

1256
01:38:22,687 --> 01:38:26,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We want a game that is unmistakably D&D, but one that can easily become your D&D.

1257
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:28,511
[SPEAKER_07]: The game that you want to run and play.

1258
01:38:28,551 --> 01:38:31,234
[SPEAKER_07]: That is from their official announcement that they sent out earlier this week.

1259
01:38:31,734 --> 01:38:40,201
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say, by involving you in the process, we can build a set of D&D rules that incorporate the wants and desires of D&D gamers around the world.

1260
01:38:40,641 --> 01:38:46,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they are going to, I guess, at least are claiming that they're going to be user input in a lot of features of this game.

1261
01:38:47,169 --> 01:38:49,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't there supposed to be a lot of user input in Mega Man Legends 3 too?

1262
01:38:49,831 --> 01:38:50,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And look where that got.

1263
01:38:52,294 --> 01:38:52,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Womp womp.

1264
01:38:54,685 --> 01:38:55,425
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I'm not.

1265
01:38:55,645 --> 01:39:00,928
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, obviously D&D is a classic game, but it's going to be very interesting to see what direction it gets taken in.

1266
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:11,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you would think the people that play it regularly would know a lot, but sometimes, I don't know, like I go to World of Warcraft, which obviously heavily influenced by D&D, right?

1267
01:39:12,373 --> 01:39:18,376
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Warcraft almost listened too much to its vocal fan base in this latest one.

1268
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:23,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Cataclysm really kind of catered to a lot of the very vocal people, and because of that, it's the weakest expansion.

1269
01:39:23,678 --> 01:39:24,238
[SPEAKER_05]: D&D needs more T&A

1270
01:39:46,545 --> 01:39:47,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get drunk.

1271
01:39:47,126 --> 01:39:48,927
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's any chicks there, I want to do them.

1272
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:07,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Sparkle

1273
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:33,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's interesting about that is that the components of the Mr. Sparkle achievement say, from stage one, make it to stage three bosses in survival mode within the Japanese ROM.

1274
01:40:33,784 --> 01:40:44,009
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is spoiling of sorts, the fact that in this Simpsons arcade game that's going to come out in 360, you're going to be able to play the original, or US, I guess, ROM, but you also get to play the Japanese ROM.

1275
01:40:45,049 --> 01:40:51,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, the Japanese ROM has lower difficulty, more health items, more points, and the ability to jump while holding a weapon.

1276
01:40:52,451 --> 01:40:53,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.

1277
01:40:54,051 --> 01:40:55,152
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to be in that release.

1278
01:40:55,932 --> 01:40:58,892
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, kind of some rumors going around.

1279
01:40:58,932 --> 01:40:59,973
[SPEAKER_07]: This is big, big rumors.

1280
01:41:00,353 --> 01:41:04,474
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently, Retro Studios, which is one of the big Nintendo developers, right?

1281
01:41:04,514 --> 01:41:05,394
[SPEAKER_07]: What did Retro Studios do?

1282
01:41:05,414 --> 01:41:05,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they...

1283
01:41:05,834 --> 01:41:06,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Donkey Kong

1284
01:41:27,771 --> 01:41:32,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to work on another project that I am super excited about.

1285
01:41:32,593 --> 01:41:38,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't talk about it too much, but if all goes well, it might just be one of my crowning achievements as an artist.

1286
01:41:38,814 --> 01:41:39,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another Zelda game.

1287
01:41:40,915 --> 01:41:41,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You think?

1288
01:41:41,775 --> 01:41:43,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they've already, you know...

1289
01:41:45,701 --> 01:42:13,717
[SPEAKER_06]: they you know put forth some effort into making stuff for Mario Kart and I think that they were you know they've been commented about saying no hey we'd love to get our hands on Zelda I think it's a Zelda like spin-off or something like that new like type of Zelda game well Zelda or not it could be very interesting to see what this is because this could be that big announcement at E3 like here is what the core gamer is gonna want a Wii U for yeah but see here's the thing though

1290
01:42:15,097 --> 01:42:17,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when they said the same thing about Metroid Other M?

1291
01:42:17,721 --> 01:42:18,442
[SPEAKER_06]: How did that do?

1292
01:42:19,564 --> 01:42:21,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It just, like, tanked.

1293
01:42:22,108 --> 01:42:22,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so...

1294
01:42:24,381 --> 01:42:24,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1295
01:42:24,981 --> 01:42:25,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1296
01:42:51,138 --> 01:42:56,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And fuck, if you can't sell a Metroid game on a Nintendo system, you got problems.

1297
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:01,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on with some more rapid fire news.

1298
01:43:01,415 --> 01:43:01,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan.

1299
01:43:03,891 --> 01:43:13,278
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who remember the XCOM franchise from the 90s, a company named Firaxis showed up at E3 last year saying that they were going to bring back the franchise.

1300
01:43:13,598 --> 01:43:17,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely missed the XCOM train when I was in junior high and high school.

1301
01:43:18,262 --> 01:43:23,666
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever want, I have the entire XCOM collection I bought on Steam for like four bucks, which has like five XCOM games.

1302
01:43:24,106 --> 01:43:25,868
[SPEAKER_07]: They were pretty awesome.

1303
01:43:25,948 --> 01:43:26,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Old ones were.

1304
01:43:26,428 --> 01:43:27,289
[SPEAKER_07]: The really old ones were.

1305
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:37,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So we haven't seen much about the FPS version of the XCOM game, or rather under the XCOM license that Firaxis is bringing back.

1306
01:43:37,808 --> 01:43:42,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because it's being pushed to 2013, has been cancelled.

1307
01:43:42,232 --> 01:43:48,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess maybe they're having problems imagining how XCOM would function as an FPS, but they're still developing it, they just need more time.

1308
01:43:49,377 --> 01:43:53,801
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the XCOM strategy reboot, which I guess is more...

1309
01:43:55,882 --> 01:43:57,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's more to what XCOM originally was.

1310
01:43:57,543 --> 01:43:59,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still on board for a 2012 release.

1311
01:44:00,044 --> 01:44:02,425
[SPEAKER_07]: They've also renamed the game to XCOM Forever.

1312
01:44:03,265 --> 01:44:03,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

1313
01:44:04,626 --> 01:44:07,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this has it here as XCOM Enemy Unknown.

1314
01:44:07,387 --> 01:44:07,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a joke.

1315
01:44:07,967 --> 01:44:09,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Duke Nukem Forever.

1316
01:44:09,948 --> 01:44:10,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trolling.

1317
01:44:10,809 --> 01:44:11,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired.

1318
01:44:11,269 --> 01:44:12,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like a low-flying jet over my head.

1319
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:14,751
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a bad joke.

1320
01:44:14,771 --> 01:44:16,391
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that going over me?

1321
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:30,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, so next quick fire story is there's a game that was put on Kickstarter, which is like, I have a great idea and please fund my project.

1322
01:44:31,028 --> 01:44:34,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I only need five grand and me and my friend will design this and blah, blah, blah.

1323
01:44:35,411 --> 01:44:41,595
[SPEAKER_05]: A game called Oregon Trail, not Oregon the state, but Oregon like a kidney.

1324
01:44:41,895 --> 01:44:44,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon Trail Director's Cut, a success on Kickstarter.

1325
01:44:44,637 --> 01:44:45,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1326
01:44:45,938 --> 01:44:58,041
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be a zombie-filled spoof of the Oregon Trail where I guess you've got a map and you're trying to survive getting from point A to point B. A destination where, of course, the big stronghold is that is keeping the zombies out.

1327
01:44:58,741 --> 01:45:01,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And they met their Kickstarter goal.

1328
01:45:01,922 --> 01:45:06,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully that will be developed and released and everyone will have a grand old time.

1329
01:45:07,783 --> 01:45:14,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And this image here, it looks like they've got some pixelated Sean from Shaun of the Dead and some of the characters from Zombieland in sort of a...

1330
01:45:16,927 --> 01:45:18,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn left, you moron.

1331
01:45:38,527 --> 01:45:43,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like the files should work with the Garmin Mobile XT units.

1332
01:45:44,509 --> 01:45:48,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking maybe it might be TomTom because they're the huge sort of standalone GPS.

1333
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:55,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I thought for sure that TomTom would because they have a ton of voices like you get James Earl Jones and Samuel Jackson.

1334
01:45:55,412 --> 01:45:56,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this here has lists.

1335
01:45:58,993 --> 01:46:00,273
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Samuel Jackson.

1336
01:46:00,293 --> 01:46:01,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there is a Samuel Jackson.

1337
01:46:01,913 --> 01:46:02,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Left, motherfucker!

1338
01:46:03,054 --> 01:46:03,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you do it?

1339
01:46:04,314 --> 01:46:05,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, that is it.

1340
01:46:08,834 --> 01:46:13,538
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Mr. T. There's got to be a Macho Man Savage one.

1341
01:46:14,698 --> 01:46:15,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1342
01:46:15,519 --> 01:46:16,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Go straight six miles.

1343
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:17,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1344
01:46:18,341 --> 01:46:18,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1345
01:46:20,123 --> 01:46:21,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Destination on the left, boy.

1346
01:46:22,645 --> 01:46:24,486
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know they have like a Darth Vader one.

1347
01:46:25,166 --> 01:46:25,887
[SPEAKER_06]: TomTom Voices.

1348
01:46:25,907 --> 01:46:26,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1349
01:46:26,648 --> 01:46:27,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1350
01:46:27,808 --> 01:46:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I kind of need a GPS.

1351
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:29,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

1352
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:30,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

1353
01:46:30,731 --> 01:46:31,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Marge Simpson.

1354
01:46:32,272 --> 01:46:34,313
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the newest ones that they're highlighting.

1355
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:34,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1356
01:46:35,703 --> 01:46:36,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I kind of want a GPS.

1357
01:46:37,004 --> 01:46:37,825
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be kind of fun.

1358
01:46:38,045 --> 01:46:41,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Homer Simpson, Roger Moore, Kim Cattrall, Kit.

1359
01:46:41,487 --> 01:46:42,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Kim Cattrall?

1360
01:46:42,508 --> 01:46:43,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Kim Cattrall.

1361
01:46:43,168 --> 01:46:46,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck would you want Kim Cattrall doing your... Yoda.

1362
01:46:47,091 --> 01:46:48,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just her howling from Porky's.

1363
01:46:48,612 --> 01:46:51,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Even my mother would be like, the fuck is this?

1364
01:46:52,175 --> 01:46:59,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yoda, Han Solo, SpongeBob SquarePants, C-3PO, Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, Dory the Explorer, Darth Vader.

1365
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:02,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are some of the other funny ones here?

1366
01:47:03,623 --> 01:47:04,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Who the fuck is that?

1367
01:47:04,663 --> 01:47:04,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

1368
01:47:08,461 --> 01:47:10,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I don't even know.

1369
01:47:10,283 --> 01:47:10,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Burt Reynolds.

1370
01:47:11,224 --> 01:47:12,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard the Burt Reynolds one.

1371
01:47:12,985 --> 01:47:14,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Billy Connolly.

1372
01:47:14,947 --> 01:47:15,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis Hopper.

1373
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:16,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

1374
01:47:16,648 --> 01:47:18,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Dennis Hopper's been dead how long?

1375
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:23,573
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a Garmin Mobile XT, I guess any of them, there's a whole line of them.

1376
01:47:24,194 --> 01:47:27,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Go under Reddit and look this up because it was posted to Reddit.

1377
01:47:27,557 --> 01:47:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's Reddit people that...

1378
01:47:29,468 --> 01:47:31,189
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of dead people on there.

1379
01:47:55,712 --> 01:47:57,374
[SPEAKER_06]: and some people that should be dead.

1380
01:47:59,836 --> 01:48:00,397
[SPEAKER_06]: You're mean.

1381
01:48:01,498 --> 01:48:13,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, CES, they showed off a few things, obviously a lot of TVs, including some new smart TVs or web-enabled TVs that have Gaikai and on-live support.

1382
01:48:14,191 --> 01:48:24,060
[SPEAKER_06]: and Gaikai of course coming to some brand new LG TVs and you'll be able to stream games straight to the TV using the interface on there.

1383
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:32,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming to Google TVs would be on live service and I'm guessing they'll allow you to

1384
01:48:33,348 --> 01:48:41,435
[SPEAKER_06]: purchase the universal controller and stream stuff straight to the TV, which you have to use their player app for that.

1385
01:48:43,116 --> 01:48:54,086
[SPEAKER_06]: No word on what other devices maybe the stuff will be coming to, but it's kind of neat that someday you'll be able to get TVs that stream games straight to them.

1386
01:48:55,547 --> 01:48:57,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, if you think about it, you know,

1387
01:48:59,398 --> 01:49:09,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, these consoles, if you will, will never go away because they just keep updating the hardware on their end and they can keep running all the new games.

1388
01:49:09,812 --> 01:49:11,254
[SPEAKER_06]: You never have to buy a new console again.

1389
01:49:12,115 --> 01:49:14,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, until the resolution gets really better.

1390
01:49:14,878 --> 01:49:15,679
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very interesting.

1391
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:19,966
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very interesting direction, having the consoles directly built into the TVs, essentially.

1392
01:49:20,006 --> 01:49:29,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I realize these are kind of different, still kind of growing things, but how long before Microsoft puts out their own TV with a built-in Xbox and Kinect is right in the top of the TV on these two little cameras?

1393
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:32,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, even on top of that, I could see that in the next three years.

1394
01:49:32,763 --> 01:49:35,964
[SPEAKER_06]: What if all the console manufacturers go streaming?

1395
01:49:36,164 --> 01:49:38,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you don't need to buy the console.

1396
01:49:39,205 --> 01:49:41,045
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play Twisted Metal, and then you can play Fable.

1397
01:49:41,125 --> 01:49:45,307
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play Resistance and Dance Central.

1398
01:49:45,387 --> 01:49:47,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's all on one thing.

1399
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be very interesting.

1400
01:49:50,356 --> 01:49:51,217
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1401
01:50:06,654 --> 01:50:12,456
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way to download entire games and all that.

1402
01:50:12,476 --> 01:50:21,399
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still kind of a ways away before these huge epic games that fill a Blu-ray we really download right into our homes all the time.

1403
01:50:21,839 --> 01:50:22,359
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1404
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:31,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the next generation of games is still going to have a physical-based format, but two generations from now, this is what we could be looking at.

1405
01:50:31,602 --> 01:50:38,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people thought we would be a download only at this point, but as far as Gaikai and OnLive are concerned, I guess we are.

1406
01:50:42,704 --> 01:50:46,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Would this be a feature that would interest you in a TV at all, guys?

1407
01:50:46,625 --> 01:50:47,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this just, eh, whatever?

1408
01:50:48,425 --> 01:50:49,966
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more, eh, whatever for me.

1409
01:50:50,846 --> 01:50:53,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a neat technology for sure.

1410
01:50:55,287 --> 01:50:55,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan?

1411
01:50:57,047 --> 01:50:58,608
[SPEAKER_07]: We might be in the market for a new TV soon.

1412
01:50:58,648 --> 01:51:00,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something we should look to get?

1413
01:51:00,328 --> 01:51:00,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1414
01:51:03,045 --> 01:51:10,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well moving on, something that may be built in that you don't want so much, I don't know, we'll see.

1415
01:51:11,252 --> 01:51:16,176
[SPEAKER_07]: But Mass Effect 3, of course, is coming out on PC as well as the various consoles.

1416
01:51:16,596 --> 01:51:20,639
[SPEAKER_07]: But Mass Effect 3 on the PC, it will require Origin.

1417
01:51:20,659 --> 01:51:21,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Origin.

1418
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:37,465
[SPEAKER_07]: It will not work on Steam As you know, EA and Valve are in a little bit of a quarrel right now Alan, you look like you're dying to comment on that situation Yeah, they're having a Wang contest Get out the ruler, boys What does it all boil down to?

1419
01:51:38,804 --> 01:51:48,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the fact that EA is not only are they a publisher and developer like Valve is, but they are also a medium of commerce distribution.

1420
01:51:48,554 --> 01:51:56,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we have two storefronts like, I don't know, Target and Walmart or Macy's and Penny's that offer the same thing.

1421
01:51:56,782 --> 01:52:00,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're just having a cockfight over distribution.

1422
01:52:00,165 --> 01:52:00,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1423
01:52:00,305 --> 01:52:02,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's how EA puts it in their press release.

1424
01:52:19,522 --> 01:52:22,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe it's the whole fact that when you have a game on Steam, patches come through Steam.

1425
01:52:22,443 --> 01:52:23,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And EA doesn't want that.

1426
01:52:36,947 --> 01:52:55,123
[SPEAKER_05]: also this happened Dragon Age 2 which I mentioned during my gaming week that I'm playing I had to install Origins to get DA2 digitally it was on Steam for a couple months this was a big story like last year and it was on Steam and they took it down because Valve and Steam had a problem with how EA handled the DLC basically what it means is

1427
01:52:56,444 --> 01:53:13,653
[SPEAKER_05]: if you buy a game on Steam Valve wants you to be able to buy DLC for it through the game itself like you load the game and then through the game interface you can buy DLC or buy the DLC a la carte via Steam with Dragon Age 2 you had to go to EA's website

1428
01:53:15,234 --> 01:53:17,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So Valve wasn't doing the transaction.

1429
01:53:18,296 --> 01:53:24,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you weren't actually doing the credit card transaction through Steam and they didn't like that.

1430
01:53:24,961 --> 01:53:27,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what got DA2 kicked off of Steam.

1431
01:53:27,662 --> 01:53:32,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So now EA is basically saying we are making the game and we have a store so you have to buy it through our store.

1432
01:53:32,926 --> 01:53:37,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Well now they are swearing up and down but even if you don't buy it in the Origin store you have to install Origin.

1433
01:53:37,969 --> 01:53:39,050
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another big thing.

1434
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:40,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Half-Life 2 did.

1435
01:53:40,531 --> 01:53:41,132
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1436
01:53:41,172 --> 01:53:41,612
[SPEAKER_07]: But here you go.

1437
01:53:42,332 --> 01:53:45,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they are saying, they're swearing Origin's not spyware.

1438
01:53:45,213 --> 01:53:49,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, Origin is not spyware and does not use or install spyware on users' machines.

1439
01:53:50,174 --> 01:54:01,417
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to allow Origin to install games and their patches for everyone to use, Origin implements a permission change that results in Windows, not Origin, reviewing the file names in the program data slash Origin folder.

1440
01:54:01,817 --> 01:54:05,498
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an ordinary Windows function, not an information gathering process.

1441
01:54:06,138 --> 01:54:10,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically they're trying to say, we swear we're not spying on you, we just want to get our store on your computer.

1442
01:54:11,778 --> 01:54:16,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Now to be fair, as Alan mentioned, this is what Valve did several years ago and it pissed people off then.

1443
01:54:16,999 --> 01:54:25,321
[SPEAKER_05]: To activate your CD key and your license for Half-Life 2, the biggest sequel of the year at the time in 2004, you had to install this bullshitty Steam store?

1444
01:54:25,381 --> 01:54:26,201
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is this?

1445
01:54:26,261 --> 01:54:27,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to play Half-Life 2.

1446
01:54:27,502 --> 01:54:33,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course the servers were overwhelmed at the time because it was unprecedented, but yeah.

1447
01:54:33,903 --> 01:54:41,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I hope I'm saying this name right in our chatroom, but it's Ahamkara, and our chatroom says, Steam is better, and I have more games there already, so they win.

1448
01:54:41,745 --> 01:54:42,365
[SPEAKER_07]: End of story.

1449
01:54:42,565 --> 01:54:43,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Origin can suck it.

1450
01:54:44,025 --> 01:54:48,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the way a lot of people kind of feel right now, is that it's like, I don't want another store.

1451
01:54:49,387 --> 01:55:00,990
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very similar to what Loki was talking about probably an hour ago with the whole movie stuff, probably at the top of the show, with that whole fact that Warner Brothers wants to force people to use Ultraviolet, and I'm like, people don't want that.

1452
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:02,170
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want...

1453
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:05,852
[SPEAKER_07]: One store focused on one company.

1454
01:55:06,652 --> 01:55:10,234
[SPEAKER_07]: And the consumer is going to lose in this because there's going to be all these different stores.

1455
01:55:10,254 --> 01:55:11,695
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I don't want all these fucking stores on my computer.

1456
01:55:11,715 --> 01:55:13,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though.

1457
01:55:14,217 --> 01:55:20,381
[SPEAKER_06]: They think that people are either going to buy it at retail or wait 56 days to watch it.

1458
01:55:20,481 --> 01:55:22,262
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to want to rent it.

1459
01:55:22,382 --> 01:55:24,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they're going to stream it via their service.

1460
01:55:25,664 --> 01:55:26,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they'll pirate it.

1461
01:55:26,544 --> 01:55:27,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they'll pirate it.

1462
01:55:27,445 --> 01:55:28,205
[SPEAKER_06]: They will pirate it.

1463
01:55:28,245 --> 01:55:29,206
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's going to happen.

1464
01:55:30,327 --> 01:55:30,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1465
01:55:32,071 --> 01:55:46,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those wondering if they have Mass Effect 1 and 2 digital deluxe editions, which were available and are still available via Steam, if they can import your save games, because the plot is continuous through the third, because it's a trilogy, the whole story is going to wrap up with Mass Effect 3.

1466
01:55:46,624 --> 01:55:55,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course, if you have the previous two games, even through Steam, it will sniff your save game file and Mass Effect 3 will continue with the choices your character has made.

1467
01:55:55,572 --> 01:56:17,038
[SPEAKER_05]: your version of Shepard so again and if you know if EA doesn't want Steam to sell it then it's it's not you know there it's not going to be on Steam if you really if this Origin thing pisses you off even if you go to Best Buy and buy a hard box copy of it at a store real store it's going to put Origin on your system there's no way to get around this unless you go to

1468
01:56:18,274 --> 01:56:18,955
[SPEAKER_05]: A crack site.

1469
01:56:19,155 --> 01:56:24,959
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be fair, exactly what Half-Life 2 did six or seven years ago.

1470
01:56:25,239 --> 01:56:26,940
[SPEAKER_07]: But there were also cracked versions of Half-Life 2.

1471
01:56:27,941 --> 01:56:28,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1472
01:56:28,661 --> 01:56:30,102
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's what's going to happen here.

1473
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,785
[SPEAKER_07]: All these companies think they know what gamers want.

1474
01:56:35,266 --> 01:56:36,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Gamers want to be left the fuck alone.

1475
01:56:37,007 --> 01:56:38,728
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what a lot of gamers want.

1476
01:56:40,069 --> 01:56:40,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

1477
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:47,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to take a moment to, you know, we say it's the show where every gamer has a voice, and one way we interact with you guys is through our email bag.

1478
01:56:47,575 --> 01:56:48,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys send us emails every week.

1479
01:56:49,916 --> 01:56:55,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And DarkSakura will usually dive in the mailbag and read your emails, but she's not here.

1480
01:56:56,501 --> 01:56:57,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I read these beforehand.

1481
01:57:28,568 --> 01:57:56,338
[SPEAKER_05]: um now what the hell we only have two emails tonight right what the hell so the backstory about this before I jump into the email and if you have a problem with this just don't be an ass in chat because Jamie would probably kick you and I would kick you too in her place so that's how I'm going to step up and be DarkSakura tonight um the Girl Scouts allow transgender girls into their into a certain chapter um

1482
01:57:56,878 --> 01:58:04,884
[SPEAKER_05]: If the parents present them as a girl and, you know, they go by a girl name, they can be in the Girl Scouts even though they were born biologically something else.

1483
01:58:05,244 --> 01:58:11,088
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a huge, there's a right wing, you know, people within the Girl Scouts that have a huge problem with this.

1484
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:18,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're asking that people not buy Girl Scout cookies until these children are thrown out.

1485
01:58:19,113 --> 01:58:21,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so you know, Alan, I think our listeners are pretty smart.

1486
01:58:22,355 --> 01:58:23,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's going to have a problem.

1487
01:58:23,716 --> 01:58:25,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but it's just... We all think that bitch is crazy.

1488
01:58:26,018 --> 01:58:26,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1489
01:58:26,878 --> 01:58:39,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So now people who are supportive of the transgender kids or girls being in the Girl Scouts are hearing about this boycott and they're like, I fucking want to buy cookies because this sounds awesome.

1490
01:58:39,222 --> 01:58:43,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It's access to different types of people.

1491
01:58:44,344 --> 01:58:46,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the email after all that backstory.

1492
01:58:46,925 --> 01:58:57,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Personi, after reading DarkSakura's Tumblr post about the Girl Scout cookie boycott, I did what I usually do in response to these kinds of right-wing protests.

1493
01:58:57,830 --> 01:59:03,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I sought out a way to do the exact opposite of what those I completely disagree with tell me not to do.

1494
01:59:04,173 --> 01:59:11,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Being antisocial and not having nieces who are currently Girl Scouts, I searched to see if I could buy Girl Scout cookies online.

1495
01:59:11,856 --> 01:59:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I was not able to find any.

1496
01:59:13,976 --> 01:59:20,378
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, according to the link at the end of this email, Girl Scouts of America does not allow their cookies to be sold online.

1497
01:59:20,619 --> 01:59:21,579
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is why?

1498
01:59:22,318 --> 01:59:30,325
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a great number of shut-ins that are yearning for the kind of awesome Samoan goodness that they cannot possibly get on any Samoan porn site.

1499
01:59:31,686 --> 01:59:41,534
[SPEAKER_05]: These people have loads of excess income that can be easily spent on fundraisers that fund the instilling freedom and independence into the mind of young girls across this great land.

1500
01:59:41,614 --> 01:59:50,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Without programs such as the ones done by the Girl Scouts of America, more women may become shut-ins like the men that could potentially fund the GSA.

1501
01:59:51,802 --> 01:59:59,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I urge everyone to urge the Girl Scouts of America to allow the sale of Girl Scout cookies online.

1502
01:59:59,347 --> 02:00:02,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to do that for I Am Too Busy playing Skyrim.

1503
02:00:03,570 --> 02:00:05,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay black, Redertainment.

1504
02:00:06,233 --> 02:00:07,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, here's the thing.

1505
02:00:07,334 --> 02:00:22,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the reason why they don't want you to buy them online is keep in mind that, you know, the whole stuff they're trying to teach in the Girl Scouts, I think is part of the whole like going out and, you know, they want the girls to be able to, you know, get out in the community and sell them.

1506
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:25,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, even though you make the case, I don't want to leave my house.

1507
02:00:26,894 --> 02:00:29,635
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is they want the Girl Scouts to leave the house to do this.

1508
02:00:29,695 --> 02:00:36,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It's to teach the Scouts customer service and how to count money and how to run a budget and blah, blah, blah.

1509
02:00:36,678 --> 02:00:37,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1510
02:00:37,339 --> 02:00:40,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So for that, I mean, you don't have the girls in a factory doing all this.

1511
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:41,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe, I don't know.

1512
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:43,541
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, they're not going to learn as much from that.

1513
02:00:43,581 --> 02:00:46,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's about being out there in the community, being visible.

1514
02:00:46,102 --> 02:00:48,343
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they're out in the grocery stores and things like that.

1515
02:00:48,363 --> 02:00:53,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, Red Entertainment, at some point, you're going to have to get out of the house and go get groceries.

1516
02:00:53,946 --> 02:00:54,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, well, then again...

1517
02:00:55,146 --> 02:00:56,827
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're usually parked out at Safeway.

1518
02:01:17,972 --> 02:01:20,714
[SPEAKER_05]: If they open up online ordering... Oh, goddamn case.

1519
02:01:20,874 --> 02:01:21,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

1520
02:01:22,755 --> 02:01:29,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they only make a certain amount a year because, you know, they give the boxes to whatever the chapters are in each state.

1521
02:01:29,658 --> 02:01:31,780
[SPEAKER_05]: They go out to the little suburbs.

1522
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:37,623
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have to make a shitload more cookies and they would have to do fulfillment and how to ship it and pricing and blah, blah, blah.

1523
02:01:37,703 --> 02:01:41,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really just about the scouts going out into the community and selling cookies.

1524
02:01:41,585 --> 02:01:42,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that's going to change.

1525
02:01:43,086 --> 02:01:43,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1526
02:01:43,886 --> 02:01:49,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be nice, but if they sold them online, there'd be no point in setting up the little tables and irritating you.

1527
02:01:50,859 --> 02:01:54,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, but to be... Irritating you.

1528
02:01:54,281 --> 02:02:02,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I always buy the Girl Scout cookies because, like, you know, when I... You know, for me, usually, it's kind of like, you know, I'll be walking in stores and the Girl Scouts are here and like, would you like to buy Girl Scout cookies?

1529
02:02:03,027 --> 02:02:05,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, fucking yeah.

1530
02:02:05,029 --> 02:02:07,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll have... Fuck yeah, I want Girl Scout cookies.

1531
02:02:07,930 --> 02:02:09,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for being here.

1532
02:02:09,812 --> 02:02:10,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

1533
02:02:10,532 --> 02:02:12,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss Samoas so much or whatever they're called now.

1534
02:02:14,235 --> 02:02:15,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Thin Mints all the way.

1535
02:02:16,176 --> 02:02:16,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And the peanut butter ones.

1536
02:02:17,297 --> 02:02:17,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out.

1537
02:02:18,237 --> 02:02:18,518
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1538
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:23,640
[SPEAKER_07]: That email had nothing to do with video games.

1539
02:02:23,881 --> 02:02:27,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess sometimes people eat Girl Scout cookies while playing video games, so there you go.

1540
02:02:27,242 --> 02:02:27,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1541
02:02:27,582 --> 02:02:27,863
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1542
02:02:30,184 --> 02:02:30,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, folks.

1543
02:02:31,665 --> 02:02:34,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I've got to read this comment from our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

1544
02:02:35,306 --> 02:02:40,469
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, so it will be like EverQuest and we can type slash Girl Scout cookies.

1545
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:43,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you still do that in EverQuest?

1546
02:02:43,511 --> 02:02:44,791
[SPEAKER_07]: EverQuest 2 went free.

1547
02:02:44,811 --> 02:02:47,393
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the Pizza Hut or the Roundtable plug-in, right?

1548
02:02:47,413 --> 02:02:48,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, slash pizza.

1549
02:02:48,473 --> 02:02:50,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, that was like a running gag on OLR for a year.

1550
02:02:50,896 --> 02:02:52,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the whole slash pizza thing.

1551
02:02:53,058 --> 02:02:54,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if they still do that.

1552
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, EverQuest went free to play and all that.

1553
02:02:56,783 --> 02:02:56,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1554
02:02:57,243 --> 02:02:57,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1555
02:02:59,656 --> 02:03:03,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi folks, I listened to last night's show today, enjoyed it as always.

1556
02:03:03,938 --> 02:03:05,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to chip in on this open discussion.

1557
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this blackout day has to happen.

1558
02:03:09,381 --> 02:03:13,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people who are not plugged into the geek community have no concept of what it is or what it means.

1559
02:03:14,464 --> 02:03:19,006
[SPEAKER_05]: What's worse is because the media wants it in the news networks are not bringing it to the forefront.

1560
02:03:23,889 --> 02:03:30,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't wait until the 23rd, but do it on the 20th to allow for the desired backlash against the bill to build.

1561
02:03:31,174 --> 02:03:34,756
[SPEAKER_05]: This would also be too big of a story for the major news outlets to ignore.

1562
02:03:35,477 --> 02:03:38,639
[SPEAKER_05]: What gets me the most is the congressman pushing it.

1563
02:03:39,319 --> 02:03:44,743
[SPEAKER_05]: It is extremely dismissive of the critics, including internet and security experts, including Vincent Cerf.

1564
02:03:45,383 --> 02:03:52,908
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems he doesn't care because the big media filling his coffers wants it, and the heck with representing his constituents or observing the Constitution.

1565
02:03:54,032 --> 02:03:55,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about that next time you're at the ballot box.

1566
02:03:57,658 --> 02:03:58,318
[SPEAKER_07]: All very good points.

1567
02:03:58,398 --> 02:04:07,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously there's been a lot of changes with SOPA just like over the weekend and it's coming up on our show a little later so if you haven't already heard I'll kind of clarify some of the developments with SOPA.

1568
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:12,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Long story short, it sounds like we're being heard and that's a great thing.

1569
02:04:13,381 --> 02:04:14,821
[SPEAKER_07]: All the way at the top we're being heard.

1570
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:18,022
[SPEAKER_05]: President Obama put out a statement about it, right?

1571
02:04:18,042 --> 02:04:19,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, which we'll cover a little later.

1572
02:04:19,542 --> 02:04:20,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Wink wink.

1573
02:04:22,803 --> 02:04:25,243
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been known to say one thing and then all of a sudden, ha!

1574
02:04:26,023 --> 02:04:49,851
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah so but I mean yeah so it's it's kind of one of those we've won the battle but not won the war type of thing because you know then the MPAA put out this whole thing about you know well it's all these thieves are just trying to win and da da da da da and it's kind of like take a chill pill the movie industry has been suffering not because of piracy but because the movies have been bad and that was take care signed Wendy that was from Wendy

1575
02:04:50,211 --> 02:05:04,354
[SPEAKER_07]: or the fact that, you know what, when it costs $51 for three people to go see a movie that they could have rented at Blockbuster for $250, you know, it's like, there's the problem, Hollywood.

1576
02:05:04,394 --> 02:05:05,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your head out of your butt.

1577
02:05:07,075 --> 02:05:09,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, we'll talk a little more about the SOPA updates a little later.

1578
02:05:10,115 --> 02:05:11,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were our two emails.

1579
02:05:11,535 --> 02:05:12,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag is over.

1580
02:05:12,656 --> 02:05:15,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1581
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:18,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Send us your emails on whatever is going on in the gaming world this week.

1582
02:05:19,676 --> 02:05:21,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, some more gaming news.

1583
02:05:21,177 --> 02:05:24,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to get to your calls in just a little bit and your Twitter topics.

1584
02:05:24,279 --> 02:05:27,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So get those Twitter topics locked in at twitter.com slash OLR.

1585
02:05:27,601 --> 02:05:29,403
[SPEAKER_07]: You got about five more minutes to get those in.

1586
02:05:29,843 --> 02:05:35,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will be taking your calls in a little bit at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.

1587
02:05:35,146 --> 02:05:36,727
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't already have us on there, you should add us.

1588
02:05:37,188 --> 02:05:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1589
02:05:38,228 --> 02:05:40,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all one word if you want to give us a call a little later on.

1590
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:42,151
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have a few more stories.

1591
02:05:42,571 --> 02:05:43,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't call just yet.

1592
02:05:44,553 --> 02:05:49,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, before we get to the stories, it's very important that we have our moment to rant.

1593
02:05:50,196 --> 02:05:52,579
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little segment we do here called the FUs of the week.

1594
02:05:52,699 --> 02:05:53,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1595
02:05:53,259 --> 02:05:53,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can.

1596
02:06:09,593 --> 02:06:10,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

1597
02:06:11,341 --> 02:06:13,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, the locksmith that fixed my car.

1598
02:06:14,544 --> 02:06:26,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Because not only did you arrive two hours late, but you also drilled a hole into my ignition, which looks weird, and also left a bunch of metal shavings all over the floor of my car.

1599
02:06:26,773 --> 02:06:27,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't bother to fix that.

1600
02:06:28,174 --> 02:06:28,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks!

1601
02:06:29,155 --> 02:06:30,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll definitely pass out your cards.

1602
02:06:33,421 --> 02:06:35,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, do you have any FUs of the week?

1603
02:06:36,184 --> 02:06:50,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a very finicky and light sleeper, so it doesn't matter how amazing and comfortable a sleeping arrangement is, if I've never slept there before, it's going to take me an hour or two to fall asleep, and I'm running on about two hours of sleep right now.

1604
02:06:51,076 --> 02:06:53,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, it doesn't help that I'm always elbowing you in the back here.

1605
02:06:53,198 --> 02:06:53,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1606
02:06:53,979 --> 02:06:57,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm so tired.

1607
02:06:57,562 --> 02:07:02,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always loved, you know, pitching in to help co-host OLR, but I feel like I'm slurring my words.

1608
02:07:02,226 --> 02:07:03,847
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how tired I am.

1609
02:07:04,808 --> 02:07:08,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So... You're waking up every hour with a baby.

1610
02:07:08,651 --> 02:07:09,211
[SPEAKER_05]: He has me.

1611
02:07:10,392 --> 02:07:12,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to read.

1612
02:07:12,674 --> 02:07:14,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, you're snoring.

1613
02:07:14,816 --> 02:07:15,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1614
02:07:15,577 --> 02:07:18,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, snoring, because I only snore when I'm exhausted.

1615
02:07:18,279 --> 02:07:18,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1616
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:20,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm like trying to read emails.

1617
02:07:21,582 --> 02:07:22,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Words.

1618
02:07:22,563 --> 02:07:23,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna fall asleep.

1619
02:07:23,643 --> 02:07:29,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, F you to being tired and also just being a finicky, prissive sleeper.

1620
02:07:29,348 --> 02:07:30,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1621
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:33,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a lot to be mad about.

1622
02:07:33,151 --> 02:07:34,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a three-day weekend this weekend.

1623
02:07:34,853 --> 02:07:35,553
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1624
02:07:36,034 --> 02:07:37,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how can I be in a bad mood?

1625
02:07:37,215 --> 02:07:38,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to go to work tomorrow.

1626
02:07:38,476 --> 02:07:40,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the day off to do whatever I want.

1627
02:07:41,468 --> 02:07:44,829
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that Alan is so tired that we won't be able to go anywhere in the morning.

1628
02:07:47,731 --> 02:07:52,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, I'm really pretty happy with a lot of things right now.

1629
02:07:53,933 --> 02:07:57,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of tired earlier today, though, so F you to being really tired.

1630
02:07:58,315 --> 02:08:01,417
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that I can't stay up as late anymore, it seems like.

1631
02:08:01,897 --> 02:08:07,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I used to be able to easy stay up for Rocky Horror and be up until 3.34 in the morning, but now I get fucking tired at like 12.31.

1632
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:08,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because I'm old?

1633
02:08:09,181 --> 02:08:09,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it.

1634
02:08:10,102 --> 02:08:10,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck!

1635
02:08:10,562 --> 02:08:15,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And Disneyland is having a 24-hour day for Leap Day, February 29th, and it's like...

1636
02:08:17,486 --> 02:08:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, we're working a ride Space Mountain at 4 in the morning.

1637
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:21,271
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be fucking awesome.

1638
02:08:21,311 --> 02:08:23,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, how the hell am I gonna stay up until 4?

1639
02:08:23,794 --> 02:08:24,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus Christ.

1640
02:08:24,856 --> 02:08:25,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Monster.

1641
02:08:25,617 --> 02:08:28,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I never drink that kind of shit, but I'll do it for Disney.

1642
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:29,782
[SPEAKER_05]: 24 hours of Disney.

1643
02:08:30,283 --> 02:08:32,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And my clubbing days are over.

1644
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:33,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do disco naps anymore.

1645
02:08:37,810 --> 02:08:41,551
[SPEAKER_07]: When we started this show, we were ranting about getting into our mid-20s.

1646
02:08:41,651 --> 02:08:43,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's our mid-30s.

1647
02:08:44,312 --> 02:08:44,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Wah.

1648
02:08:45,252 --> 02:08:47,792
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on with some gaming news, Loki.

1649
02:08:48,773 --> 02:08:50,053
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1650
02:08:50,333 --> 02:08:54,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk a little bit about a witch hunt that was going on.

1651
02:08:54,894 --> 02:09:00,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually kind of funny because it was regarding Witcher 2 and people pirating the game.

1652
02:09:00,656 --> 02:09:05,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember back a few months ago or so when CD Projekt said...

1653
02:09:06,477 --> 02:09:12,038
[SPEAKER_06]: That they're going to be targeting pirates and they're going to be filing legal action against them.

1654
02:09:12,678 --> 02:09:22,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, eventually they penned an open letter to the gaming community where they, you know, said they're going to stop doing that.

1655
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:27,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, apparently, though, they're still saying, you know, piracy hurts them.

1656
02:09:28,402 --> 02:09:28,982
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1657
02:09:32,385 --> 02:09:32,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1658
02:09:32,945 --> 02:09:34,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they stopped.

1659
02:09:34,187 --> 02:09:43,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing that they had less good luck than they'd hoped finding the people that stole the stuff from them.

1660
02:09:43,256 --> 02:09:48,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say it's either bad PR or realized it was going to cost them too much money.

1661
02:09:48,341 --> 02:09:52,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably just one of those when they really thought about what they were doing, they realized it wasn't cost-effective.

1662
02:09:53,709 --> 02:09:54,189
[SPEAKER_07]: or something.

1663
02:09:55,050 --> 02:09:55,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1664
02:09:55,870 --> 02:10:01,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of surprised they don't pursue one or two to make an example, but I don't know.

1665
02:10:01,593 --> 02:10:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, or maybe, maybe, just crazy thought here, maybe it has something to do with they watched the whole internet backlash for GoDaddy.

1666
02:10:10,697 --> 02:10:19,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people watched what happened with that whole thing where GoDaddy really got pressured by their customer to change their stance on SOPA and, you know,

1667
02:10:20,081 --> 02:10:34,633
[SPEAKER_07]: obviously they were wrong on SOPA and they should have turned around but I mean it was really money talks in that case and I bet a lot of tech companies are looking at that going dude don't piss off the internet I mean after all it's they're they're the ones giving us money

1668
02:10:35,173 --> 02:11:03,038
[SPEAKER_06]: here's the actual reason why they stopped basically it says our fans have always remained our greatest concern and we pride ourselves on the fact that you all know that we listen to you and take your opinions to heart while we are confident that no one who legally owns one of our games has been required to compensate us for copyright infringement we value our fans, our supporters and our community too highly to take the chance that we might even falsely accuse even one individual

1669
02:11:03,738 --> 02:11:06,959
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently there's a foolproof way of... A change of heart.

1670
02:11:07,219 --> 02:11:13,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, and in a way, what if the whole thing went to trial and so forth, and then it doesn't go their way?

1671
02:11:13,801 --> 02:11:15,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe they're really afraid of that.

1672
02:11:15,901 --> 02:11:17,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, that could be part of it, too.

1673
02:11:18,162 --> 02:11:18,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1674
02:11:19,522 --> 02:11:20,042
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyhow.

1675
02:11:20,923 --> 02:11:21,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to...

1676
02:11:23,069 --> 02:11:25,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Video Games Saving Lives Words with Friends

1677
02:11:46,906 --> 02:11:49,669
[SPEAKER_07]: is a very popular iOS... It's fucking Scrabble.

1678
02:11:49,769 --> 02:11:52,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I know they're not allowed to say it's Scrabble.

1679
02:11:52,431 --> 02:11:52,791
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Scrabble.

1680
02:11:52,811 --> 02:11:53,792
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's fucking Scrabble.

1681
02:11:53,932 --> 02:11:56,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Words with Friends is fucking Scrabble on the iPhone.

1682
02:11:57,516 --> 02:11:59,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Words with Friends is like Bowl Cart.

1683
02:12:01,459 --> 02:12:03,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And Scrabble is like Mario Kart.

1684
02:12:03,961 --> 02:12:08,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Although they actually remembered to change Moo Moo Farm on the banner.

1685
02:12:08,966 --> 02:12:11,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they would change the board in Words with Friends.

1686
02:12:11,508 --> 02:12:11,868
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway...

1687
02:12:12,649 --> 02:12:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the deal about Words With Friends is that you could actually chat.

1688
02:12:16,331 --> 02:12:17,932
[SPEAKER_07]: You could chat with people that you're playing with.

1689
02:12:17,972 --> 02:12:19,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually have friends that will play.

1690
02:12:19,953 --> 02:12:21,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like Words With Friends, personally.

1691
02:12:23,274 --> 02:12:24,695
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why I don't like Words With Friends?

1692
02:12:24,815 --> 02:12:25,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's too easy to cheat.

1693
02:12:26,616 --> 02:12:28,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It is way too easy because it's not a live game.

1694
02:12:29,177 --> 02:12:30,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been tempted to do this.

1695
02:12:30,578 --> 02:12:32,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on Google and find an anagram finder.

1696
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Go on anagram.net or whatever it is.

1697
02:12:34,701 --> 02:12:35,622
[SPEAKER_07]: It's even easier than that.

1698
02:12:35,982 --> 02:12:36,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, seriously.

1699
02:12:37,263 --> 02:12:43,348
[SPEAKER_07]: They have apps where you take a screen print of your words with friends and then you run it through the app and it tells you here's the best play.

1700
02:12:43,768 --> 02:12:44,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like...

1701
02:12:45,399 --> 02:12:58,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I could play with people that I know wouldn't cheat, but like, I just, if I have the alerts on, my fucking phone goes off at 2.30 in the morning with some of my, you know, some of my friends stay up late or they're on different coasts or whatever.

1702
02:12:58,170 --> 02:13:02,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of my friends on the East Coast will just be getting up for the day at 6 a.m.

1703
02:13:02,333 --> 02:13:05,436
[SPEAKER_07]: and makes their play in words with friends and here I am fast asleep at 3 a.m.

1704
02:13:05,976 --> 02:13:06,477
Do-do-do-do-do.

1705
02:13:08,158 --> 02:13:08,839
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

1706
02:13:24,916 --> 02:13:31,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway, I've been dragging this out, but long story short, there was a random match played in Word with Friends with these two folks.

1707
02:13:32,279 --> 02:13:41,582
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them was an Australian, and one of them was here in Missouri, and they just got randomly matched up, but they were chatting with each other and I guess having a very nice conversation, which...

1708
02:13:42,322 --> 02:14:00,796
[SPEAKER_07]: is almost newsworthy in itself ASL everybody I chat with on the internet that's usually a stranger is usually a dumbass like no offense you guys I'm talking about the strangers like if I play random online games with strangers like Uno or something like I get the biggest dumb fucks on the internet you know

1709
02:14:01,636 --> 02:14:06,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a miracle in one that civil people got together to play this game.

1710
02:14:07,498 --> 02:14:18,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And then apparently this guy in Australia, Simon Fletcher, was playing Words with Friends and he started complaining in the chat, I've been having chest pains and whatever.

1711
02:14:18,661 --> 02:14:21,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, how does that even fucking come up in chat?

1712
02:14:22,882 --> 02:14:27,144
[SPEAKER_07]: You just played the word heartburn for 45 points.

1713
02:14:27,284 --> 02:14:29,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm replying so low.

1714
02:14:29,526 --> 02:14:32,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm typing with one hand because my arm is having shooting.

1715
02:14:33,868 --> 02:14:36,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't use my right arm right now because I'm having shooting pain.

1716
02:14:36,629 --> 02:14:37,990
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that even come up in a random chat?

1717
02:14:38,050 --> 02:14:38,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1718
02:14:38,370 --> 02:14:38,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1719
02:14:39,151 --> 02:14:40,331
[SPEAKER_07]: But they've been talking about it.

1720
02:14:40,551 --> 02:14:43,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And Beth Legler was the opponent.

1721
02:14:44,554 --> 02:14:46,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were playing against Beth.

1722
02:14:46,915 --> 02:14:48,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Simon and his wife were playing against Beth.

1723
02:14:49,216 --> 02:14:51,939
[SPEAKER_07]: and Beth, luckily, was married to a doctor.

1724
02:14:52,519 --> 02:14:58,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of told her husband about, oh, well, I've been playing with this guy in Australia, but he's telling me da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1725
02:14:58,685 --> 02:15:01,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy, the doctor said, you know what?

1726
02:15:01,568 --> 02:15:03,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Simon needs to go to a hospital immediately.

1727
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:09,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And sure enough, when he finally went to the hospital, he had a 99% blockage near his heart.

1728
02:15:09,976 --> 02:15:12,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was right to tell the guy to go to a hospital.

1729
02:15:12,518 --> 02:15:17,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I get with this whole video game saving lives thing or whatever.

1730
02:15:17,181 --> 02:15:21,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that part of it's obviously getting blown out of proportion, just like Loki was rolling his eyes at the beginning of the story.

1731
02:15:22,103 --> 02:15:27,006
[SPEAKER_07]: This was more about guys being fucking stubborn when it comes to going to the doctor.

1732
02:15:28,827 --> 02:15:30,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be real.

1733
02:15:30,408 --> 02:15:32,709
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of you probably are guys.

1734
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:35,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Those few ladies that are out there listening, I know there's a few of you.

1735
02:15:36,171 --> 02:15:43,075
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of you know guys that are too stubborn to go to the doctor because they don't want to admit something's wrong with them or they don't want to admit they're getting old or whatever it is?

1736
02:15:44,316 --> 02:15:50,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is more a fact that, honey, a doctor is telling me you need to go to the hospital.

1737
02:15:50,359 --> 02:15:52,220
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to go to the fucking hospital.

1738
02:15:53,641 --> 02:16:01,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I know someone whose dad had a minor incident and it turned out to be serious, but he also hadn't set foot in a doctor's office in almost 30 years.

1739
02:16:04,028 --> 02:16:05,388
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

1740
02:16:05,408 --> 02:16:12,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And his attitude was, you don't see doctors because nothing exists until they find it, and that's when you're sick.

1741
02:16:12,231 --> 02:16:14,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you don't go to the doctor, they won't find you.

1742
02:16:15,192 --> 02:16:19,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize some people avoid the doctor due to, well, not having insurance.

1743
02:16:19,413 --> 02:16:21,574
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a whole other Oprah I'm not going to get into.

1744
02:16:22,074 --> 02:16:26,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they avoid the doctor maybe because of religious reasons, I guess.

1745
02:16:26,275 --> 02:16:32,197
[SPEAKER_07]: But for real, if neither of those apply to you and you're just being fucking stubborn, like, go.

1746
02:16:35,717 --> 02:16:36,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you want to be healthy?

1747
02:16:37,598 --> 02:16:37,918
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1748
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:39,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

1749
02:16:41,061 --> 02:16:43,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yay words with friends bringing people together.

1750
02:16:45,303 --> 02:16:49,526
[SPEAKER_07]: This could have been about a 1997 AOL chat room.

1751
02:16:49,606 --> 02:16:50,167
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1752
02:16:51,487 --> 02:16:51,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1753
02:16:52,448 --> 02:16:53,469
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on, Alan.

1754
02:16:54,730 --> 02:17:02,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So, CES just happened, and usually that's a big electronics and hardware gadgetry event.

1755
02:17:03,135 --> 02:17:07,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much for the gaming, that's mostly saved of course for Tokyo Game Show and E3 and all that.

1756
02:17:08,423 --> 02:17:19,698
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the biggest gaming related thing that came out of CES most likely is the Project Fiona gaming touchscreen tablet by a company called Razer, the E-R-A-Z-E-R.

1757
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:49,174
[SPEAKER_05]: and I must admit looking at the pictures of this thing it looks like a very sexy device it looks well made it's sleek and it's going to run an Intel Ivy Bridge Core i7 processor it's going to have three axis tilt gyro functionality a magnetometer accelerometer force feedback it's going to vibrate Dolby 7 surround sound with built in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

1758
02:17:50,234 --> 02:17:56,196
[SPEAKER_05]: and Razer CEO Minliang Tan explains, we are looking to change the whole perception of tablets.

1759
02:17:56,716 --> 02:18:06,080
[SPEAKER_05]: This first of its kind PC gaming tablet with integrated dual controllers is definitely not for playing casual games about unhappy birds or zombie killing flora.

1760
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:07,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, throw in shade.

1761
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw in shade at the iPhone games.

1762
02:18:09,781 --> 02:18:11,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine a black iPad.

1763
02:18:12,691 --> 02:18:13,011
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

1764
02:18:29,521 --> 02:18:29,861
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

1765
02:18:48,266 --> 02:18:48,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be $999.99.

1766
02:18:49,487 --> 02:18:59,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And this thing looks awesome, and it's like, alright, it's PC gaming on a tablet, and it's touchscreen, it's got all this cool shit, but where's the market?

1767
02:18:59,056 --> 02:19:09,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you have that kind of money to drop on something like this, you can get a very competent gaming laptop that is a fucking laptop, and you can do laptop shit on it.

1768
02:19:09,966 --> 02:19:11,847
[SPEAKER_07]: That laptop you're using right now, I bought for $400.

1769
02:19:13,889 --> 02:19:21,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Well over two years ago, because I was with my ex at the time, and so it was probably about three years old, and that cost me $400.

1770
02:19:21,733 --> 02:19:23,374
[SPEAKER_07]: That will run Warcraft Cataclysm on it.

1771
02:19:23,674 --> 02:19:28,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not low settings, but you can play on it, yeah.

1772
02:19:28,576 --> 02:19:30,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, I mean, imagine what $1,000 now would get you, you know?

1773
02:19:32,158 --> 02:19:36,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So the display on it is 10.1 inches diagonal viewable.

1774
02:19:37,082 --> 02:19:38,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Resolution is 1280 by 800.

1775
02:19:39,603 --> 02:19:42,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to post a link of this into chat.

1776
02:19:42,625 --> 02:19:44,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like an awesome device.

1777
02:19:44,266 --> 02:19:47,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great that they're trying to make this, but where's the market?

1778
02:19:47,628 --> 02:19:49,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this for?

1779
02:19:49,350 --> 02:19:53,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to agree with this point that Cinderwolf said in our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com.

1780
02:19:53,712 --> 02:19:58,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Cinderwolf says, did he just say 7.1 surround sound on a tablet?

1781
02:19:58,476 --> 02:19:58,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1782
02:19:59,136 --> 02:20:01,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1783
02:20:17,473 --> 02:20:23,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you've got, you're like on Amtrak and you've got these backpacks like, oh, these are my speakers, yo, and you're setting them up.

1784
02:20:23,297 --> 02:20:23,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1785
02:20:23,658 --> 02:20:28,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you have like Uber headphones that can emulate it really fucking well, you know?

1786
02:20:28,601 --> 02:20:29,342
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be a bit much.

1787
02:20:29,422 --> 02:20:32,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the Dolby 7-1 chip and firmware is in there at least.

1788
02:20:32,864 --> 02:20:33,585
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, exactly.

1789
02:20:33,645 --> 02:20:36,207
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got the speakers, then you're probably in your house.

1790
02:20:36,987 --> 02:20:37,968
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play on your desktop.

1791
02:20:38,468 --> 02:21:06,021
[SPEAKER_05]: it looks like a hot little device maybe mom is always on the desktop playing words with friends with people in Australia so maybe that's why I need a tablet it also sounds like because this tablet is so streamlined that it's going to be able to churn out max settings graphics on this little tablet that a PC where you always have to upgrade your graphics card every two years and it sounds like this is just a total monster visually on how it's going to render games but who's going to buy it?

1792
02:21:06,961 --> 02:21:08,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, is this something that interests you?

1793
02:21:08,824 --> 02:21:09,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck no.

1794
02:21:10,486 --> 02:21:11,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1795
02:21:11,027 --> 02:21:12,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too damn expensive.

1796
02:21:12,349 --> 02:21:14,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I was trying to find out.

1797
02:21:15,474 --> 02:21:16,175
[SPEAKER_06]: They have...

1798
02:21:18,769 --> 02:21:25,910
[SPEAKER_07]: This seriously makes me think, like, I'm surprised Loki doesn't try to build his own version of this for half as much.

1799
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:26,590
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

1800
02:21:27,911 --> 02:21:28,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.

1801
02:21:29,211 --> 02:21:31,351
[SPEAKER_06]: What's in it is pretty powerful.

1802
02:21:31,391 --> 02:21:35,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a Core i7 inside of it and a bunch of other, you know, fancy shit.

1803
02:21:36,332 --> 02:21:39,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And the form factor's nice, but it looks ridiculous.

1804
02:21:39,633 --> 02:21:41,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not portable at all.

1805
02:21:41,853 --> 02:21:43,333
[SPEAKER_06]: It's as portable as a laptop is.

1806
02:21:43,393 --> 02:21:45,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, just buy a fucking laptop and a controller.

1807
02:21:45,834 --> 02:21:46,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

1808
02:21:46,894 --> 02:21:47,675
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much it.

1809
02:21:47,895 --> 02:21:49,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And the price point is just ridiculous.

1810
02:21:50,296 --> 02:22:00,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to find, remember they had, this is the company that wanted to do that, Switchblade, which was the portable MMO system that was going to revolutionize everything.

1811
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that kind of flopped, and then they came out with this really fucking expensive keyboard, which I cannot find for the life of me, but I swear that keyboard's like 300 bucks.

1812
02:22:11,984 --> 02:22:28,637
[SPEAKER_07]: all I have to say though is that you know we're near probably within a month of the next iPad announcement right that should come late January February if by some I mean we all know the next iPad has to fucking be high def has to right and the rumors are swelling and all that stuff it's gonna be more powerful

1813
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:46,182
[SPEAKER_07]: If Apple finally decides, maybe now is the time To finally put some type of attachment on the iPad That gives tangible game controls This thing should not even bother coming out It's fucking dead already Like, not to sound all Apple fanboy, but let's be real

1814
02:22:47,163 --> 02:23:10,921
[SPEAKER_05]: and with the tablet and the two you know move like Sony move like gaming sticks I am interested in how those gaming sticks with the thumb you know thing translates mouse controls but what if you want to play a first-person shooter you need the WASD and the keyboard and stuff so even then even now this tablet looks like it's gonna limit the experience of the PC games that a laptop or PC would give you so

1815
02:23:14,331 --> 02:23:15,172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also like $1,000.

1816
02:23:15,612 --> 02:23:16,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1817
02:23:17,513 --> 02:23:21,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can spend $1,000 on a laptop and get a nice laptop.

1818
02:23:22,496 --> 02:23:22,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1819
02:23:23,817 --> 02:23:24,137
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1820
02:23:24,678 --> 02:23:30,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on with a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1821
02:23:31,022 --> 02:23:31,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1822
02:23:31,763 --> 02:23:35,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, by the time it actually does come out, there's going to be something better and cheaper.

1823
02:23:35,925 --> 02:23:37,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, fuck.

1824
02:23:38,067 --> 02:23:38,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Switch Play never came out.

1825
02:23:39,528 --> 02:23:42,770
[SPEAKER_06]: That was shown on E3, I think, last year, or CES or some shit.

1826
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:43,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry.

1827
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:47,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so let's talk a little bit about successful franchises.

1828
02:23:47,373 --> 02:23:54,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And one successful franchise, which I'm just surprised every day in how successful it is, Just Dance.

1829
02:23:54,379 --> 02:24:01,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And Just Dance 3 sold 7 million copies already worldwide, and that's from October.

1830
02:24:01,944 --> 02:24:08,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the series itself has moved 25 million units.

1831
02:24:09,188 --> 02:24:13,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I would definitely say that the music franchise is not dead, or at least Just Dance isn't dead.

1832
02:24:14,872 --> 02:24:20,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Konami, DDR, when have you moved 25 million units ever?

1833
02:24:21,236 --> 02:24:22,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Or 7 million units ever?

1834
02:24:23,077 --> 02:24:24,998
[SPEAKER_05]: How does Just Dance 3 compare to Dance Central 2?

1835
02:24:26,525 --> 02:24:27,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different type of game.

1836
02:24:27,726 --> 02:24:31,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Dance Central 2 is more of learning the actual dance steps.

1837
02:24:31,728 --> 02:24:35,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas Just Dance, the whole Just Dance series is more of mimicking what's on screen.

1838
02:24:35,511 --> 02:24:37,512
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember when you watched me play that ABBA game?

1839
02:24:37,652 --> 02:24:38,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1840
02:24:38,573 --> 02:24:40,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you're holding the thing.

1841
02:24:41,114 --> 02:24:42,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine that to Katy Perry songs.

1842
02:24:42,835 --> 02:24:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Just Dance.

1843
02:24:44,376 --> 02:24:48,018
[SPEAKER_05]: What I meant was the units sold.

1844
02:24:48,419 --> 02:24:48,919
[SPEAKER_05]: The sales.

1845
02:24:49,599 --> 02:24:49,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1846
02:24:49,919 --> 02:24:52,021
[SPEAKER_06]: They're far and beyond Dance Central 2.

1847
02:24:52,639 --> 02:24:56,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, because Dance Central 2 is Kinect, and everyone, of course, has a fucking Wii, so that makes sense.

1848
02:24:57,042 --> 02:25:04,068
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to say that I would be willing to bet that Just Dance 3 on the Kinect is probably outsold Dance Central 2.

1849
02:25:04,628 --> 02:25:11,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I don't know, I haven't played Just Dance 3 specifically, but Dance Central 2 is so good, like, it's kind of sad.

1850
02:25:11,914 --> 02:25:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to look up the numbers, but yeah, I'd be willing to bet that they've probably beat them out.

1851
02:25:19,557 --> 02:25:21,458
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, while you look that up, don't interrupt me.

1852
02:25:21,498 --> 02:25:22,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait till I'm done with the story.

1853
02:25:22,499 --> 02:25:28,742
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to close out today before we get to the Skype line with some more of those updates on SOPA.

1854
02:25:29,623 --> 02:25:31,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, the Stop Online Piracy Act.

1855
02:25:32,124 --> 02:25:39,028
[SPEAKER_07]: There has been, and since that email was sent in and since last week's show, there has been quite a bit of change going on with this.

1856
02:25:39,668 --> 02:25:48,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And for one, the SOPA sponsor, Lamar Smith, came out and said he's going to pull the DNS blocking provisions from the bill.

1857
02:25:49,054 --> 02:25:49,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote,

1858
02:25:49,714 --> 02:26:00,778
[SPEAKER_07]: After consultation with industry groups across the country, I feel we should remove domain name system blocking from the Stop Online Piracy Act so that the committee can further examine the issues surrounding this provision.

1859
02:26:01,178 --> 02:26:04,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, that was obviously one of the big controversial things was the whole blocking of websites.

1860
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:06,981
[SPEAKER_07]: That getting taken out of the bill.

1861
02:26:07,421 --> 02:26:13,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, also over the weekend, the Obama administration, as pretty much has already been brought up earlier in the show, but I had it listed here, so whatever.

1862
02:26:14,403 --> 02:26:18,445
[SPEAKER_07]: The Obama administration basically came out against the bills in their current form.

1863
02:26:19,025 --> 02:26:39,336
[SPEAKER_07]: saying, in a nutshell, I'm going to really try my best to summarize this, they support that foreign websites and piracy and all this needs to be stopped, but not at the cost of censoring lawful activity and must not, as they say in the release, inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small.

1864
02:26:39,736 --> 02:26:41,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, they don't want to see

1865
02:26:41,957 --> 02:26:49,381
[SPEAKER_07]: sites get shut down by corporations because of flaw wording in this bill, which is kind of where I think a lot of us are at.

1866
02:26:50,862 --> 02:26:53,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that they need to do something about foreign websites.

1867
02:26:53,283 --> 02:26:55,024
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to do something about fucking spam.

1868
02:26:55,685 --> 02:26:56,245
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1869
02:26:56,545 --> 02:26:58,406
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit is annoying, but how do you stop it?

1870
02:26:58,847 --> 02:26:59,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's an easy answer.

1871
02:27:00,027 --> 02:27:02,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't think there's an easy answer to stopping that kind of stuff.

1872
02:27:03,171 --> 02:27:04,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Good filters on your email?

1873
02:27:04,532 --> 02:27:05,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1874
02:27:20,965 --> 02:27:22,646
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just kind of where I'm at.

1875
02:27:22,726 --> 02:27:28,149
[SPEAKER_07]: You can kind of spoof a lot of that now, but maybe they need to change the system that uses encryption verification.

1876
02:27:28,689 --> 02:27:35,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess any of that could get hacked by people, but there's got to be something where there's more accountability from the original center and it's easier to track.

1877
02:27:36,093 --> 02:27:36,513
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1878
02:27:37,574 --> 02:27:55,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Just Dance and Dance Central 2 Now Dance Central 2 has been out a lot less Well, a few weeks less It's only been out 11 weeks Whereas Just Dance 3 has been out for 14 weeks Just Dance 3 is at 993,191 units That's only in the US And Dance Central 2 is at 930,858 units

1879
02:28:05,592 --> 02:28:21,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're slightly ahead, but they've been out for three more weeks Interesting, okay, well that's good to know Although, for it to be noted, this chart, which was from last week Dance Runs Rule 2 is in the 17th spot, whereas Just Dance 3 is in the 20th spot Well, that's good

1880
02:28:22,386 --> 02:28:24,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I'm not hating on Just Dance 3.

1881
02:28:24,908 --> 02:28:25,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a decent game.

1882
02:28:25,969 --> 02:28:27,169
[SPEAKER_06]: That's straight on the 360.

1883
02:28:27,209 --> 02:28:28,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not all platforms.

1884
02:28:29,191 --> 02:28:29,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1885
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:31,653
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's open up the Skype line.

1886
02:28:31,693 --> 02:28:32,213
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that time.

1887
02:28:32,233 --> 02:28:40,359
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up the Skype line now and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1888
02:28:41,039 --> 02:28:45,487
[SPEAKER_07]: While we wait for those calls to come in because there is a little bit of a delay, we have just a couple tweets tonight.

1889
02:28:45,547 --> 02:28:46,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot, but we do have a couple.

1890
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:49,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me get to some of those tweets right now.

1891
02:28:49,754 --> 02:28:53,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure there wasn't anything earlier in the week that I missed here.

1892
02:28:55,907 --> 02:28:57,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess not anything I'm catching off the top of my head.

1893
02:28:58,029 --> 02:28:58,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

1894
02:28:59,050 --> 02:28:59,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be honest.

1895
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:04,214
[SPEAKER_07]: If you tweet us on Sunday, you have a much better chance of getting read than tweeting us on Monday after the show.

1896
02:29:04,514 --> 02:29:07,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Because sometimes I lose those amongst... We get a lot of spam tweets, too.

1897
02:29:07,696 --> 02:29:08,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to filter through.

1898
02:29:09,578 --> 02:29:13,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we'll start with a tweet from Spazinator on Twitter.

1899
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:18,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweets us and says, Will there be another marathon or fuck show anytime soon?

1900
02:29:19,885 --> 02:29:20,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck show, no.

1901
02:29:20,746 --> 02:29:22,547
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a one-time thing.

1902
02:29:22,567 --> 02:29:23,008
[SPEAKER_07]: That's done.

1903
02:29:23,648 --> 02:29:25,989
[SPEAKER_07]: A marathon show, yes.

1904
02:29:26,069 --> 02:29:27,049
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been talking about it.

1905
02:29:27,089 --> 02:29:27,949
[SPEAKER_07]: We just don't know when.

1906
02:29:28,009 --> 02:29:31,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight would have been a great night for that, but just too much other stuff going on.

1907
02:29:31,591 --> 02:29:36,152
[SPEAKER_07]: So it may not be until there's another long weekend, which for me isn't until... I don't have a long weekend.

1908
02:29:36,252 --> 02:29:37,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Which for me isn't until Memorial Day.

1909
02:29:37,613 --> 02:29:38,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get President's Day off?

1910
02:29:39,053 --> 02:29:39,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1911
02:29:39,553 --> 02:29:40,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1912
02:29:40,673 --> 02:29:43,554
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I don't get President's Day off, but I do get Martin Luther King Day off.

1913
02:29:43,574 --> 02:29:44,295
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't get any of those.

1914
02:29:44,535 --> 02:29:44,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1915
02:29:45,555 --> 02:29:46,595
[SPEAKER_07]: But you get Memorial Day, right?

1916
02:29:47,075 --> 02:29:47,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1917
02:29:47,456 --> 02:29:50,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but we have other plans for Memorial Day weekend, most likely.

1918
02:29:51,437 --> 02:29:51,577
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1919
02:29:53,098 --> 02:29:53,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometime.

1920
02:29:53,858 --> 02:29:55,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It is in our minds.

1921
02:29:55,159 --> 02:29:55,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it that way.

1922
02:29:55,819 --> 02:29:59,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, again, that whole thing I talked about earlier about only being able to stay up so late.

1923
02:29:59,881 --> 02:30:03,062
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it would be fun to do another like noon to midnight show if nothing else.

1924
02:30:03,843 --> 02:30:04,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

1925
02:30:05,523 --> 02:30:09,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on our minds, but just not in the next month or two.

1926
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:13,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's see, moving on to some other tweets.

1927
02:30:14,001 --> 02:30:15,761
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets.

1928
02:30:15,861 --> 02:30:18,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start with this one about the Writers Guild.

1929
02:30:19,522 --> 02:30:22,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Announces a list of nominees for Best Writing in Video Games.

1930
02:30:23,003 --> 02:30:29,024
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the WGA, they also nominate movies and things like that, but now they get into writing for video games.

1931
02:30:29,084 --> 02:30:32,245
[SPEAKER_07]: After all, a lot of video games are very movie-sized scripts these days, right?

1932
02:30:32,785 --> 02:30:38,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So, these games got nominated for Best Video Game Writing by the WGA.

1933
02:30:39,088 --> 02:30:40,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Assassin's Creed Revelations

1934
02:30:41,704 --> 02:30:46,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Batman Arkham City, Brink, Mortal Kombat.

1935
02:30:47,085 --> 02:30:49,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It's strange, but I guess it did have a story mode.

1936
02:30:49,926 --> 02:30:51,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And Uncharted 3, Drake's Deception.

1937
02:30:52,666 --> 02:30:54,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the nominees from the WGA.

1938
02:30:55,907 --> 02:30:57,867
[SPEAKER_07]: List needs more Portal 2, in my opinion.

1939
02:30:58,107 --> 02:31:00,908
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of an obviously missing game.

1940
02:31:01,568 --> 02:31:07,029
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, still a lot of those games are very good and have very, you know, stories that suck you in.

1941
02:31:07,129 --> 02:31:08,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1942
02:31:08,909 --> 02:31:14,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1943
02:31:14,479 --> 02:31:17,324
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like to go ahead and give us a call, you can at any time.

1944
02:31:17,945 --> 02:31:18,185
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1945
02:31:19,367 --> 02:31:20,589
[SPEAKER_07]: One other story from Tiger Claw.

1946
02:31:21,829 --> 02:31:26,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Whistleblower alleges unlawful practices at Codemasters.

1947
02:31:27,733 --> 02:31:29,654
[SPEAKER_07]: He links us to this story on Shaq News.

1948
02:31:30,235 --> 02:31:34,978
[SPEAKER_07]: A former Codemasters employee has publicly accused the publisher of unlawful business practices.

1949
02:31:35,918 --> 02:31:51,509
[SPEAKER_07]: A programmer, Semisesi, I hope I said that right, was a programmer on the game Body Count, says that Codemasters has threatened former staff with bankruptcy proceedings over a dispute regarding wages the company claims were mistakenly paid out.

1950
02:31:52,509 --> 02:31:56,970
[SPEAKER_07]: He wrote this whole blog post about it saying that Codemasters frequently infringed on employees' rights.

1951
02:31:57,970 --> 02:32:03,251
[SPEAKER_07]: They failed to give workers 11 hours of rest in any 24-hour work period.

1952
02:32:04,091 --> 02:32:06,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, yet another slave driving game company story.

1953
02:32:06,892 --> 02:32:10,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we hear way too many of these on the show, which is really sad.

1954
02:32:11,172 --> 02:32:13,633
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, we got a call coming in on the Skype line, so let's go to it.

1955
02:32:13,713 --> 02:32:15,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1956
02:32:15,173 --> 02:32:15,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1957
02:32:16,233 --> 02:32:17,153
[SPEAKER_02]: This is VidPower.

1958
02:32:17,333 --> 02:32:18,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, VidPower.

1959
02:32:18,434 --> 02:32:19,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard from you in a very long time.

1960
02:32:19,914 --> 02:32:20,394
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing?

1961
02:32:21,055 --> 02:32:21,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good.

1962
02:32:21,996 --> 02:32:23,096
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with you guys?

1963
02:32:23,717 --> 02:32:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, same old shit, different week, 10 years later.

1964
02:32:26,658 --> 02:32:27,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

1965
02:32:27,379 --> 02:32:27,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1966
02:32:28,179 --> 02:32:31,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I wanted to call in and talk about CES.

1967
02:32:31,741 --> 02:32:32,302
[SPEAKER_07]: CES.

1968
02:32:32,382 --> 02:32:32,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

1969
02:32:32,862 --> 02:32:33,763
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in Vegas, right?

1970
02:32:33,843 --> 02:32:34,263
[SPEAKER_07]: You still there?

1971
02:32:34,303 --> 02:32:34,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.

1972
02:32:35,183 --> 02:32:35,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1973
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:37,445
[SPEAKER_07]: So in your backyard, did you go to the party?

1974
02:32:39,633 --> 02:32:40,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

1975
02:32:40,353 --> 02:32:48,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go to CES and I checked out the video games there and I kind of wanted to tell you guys what stuff was good there.

1976
02:32:48,197 --> 02:32:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.

1977
02:32:48,658 --> 02:32:49,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Our man on the street.

1978
02:32:49,878 --> 02:32:50,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

1979
02:32:50,619 --> 02:32:51,279
[SPEAKER_07]: How was CES?

1980
02:32:51,319 --> 02:32:52,100
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you see?

1981
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:53,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good.

1982
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:53,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.

1983
02:32:54,001 --> 02:32:54,341
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1984
02:32:55,121 --> 02:32:55,902
[SPEAKER_02]: The one game that...

1985
02:32:57,623 --> 02:33:04,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Really kind of came out to me and I wasn't expecting to like was, believe it or not, it was Microsoft Flight.

1986
02:33:05,547 --> 02:33:06,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1987
02:33:07,088 --> 02:33:08,789
[SPEAKER_02]: The upcoming flight simulator.

1988
02:33:08,809 --> 02:33:11,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's like their replacement for Microsoft Flight Simulator, right?

1989
02:33:11,490 --> 02:33:14,072
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of their new version of that for a new generation.

1990
02:33:14,798 --> 02:33:15,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.

1991
02:33:15,759 --> 02:33:21,123
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've only played like a flight simulator like once or twice in my life and I was like really awful.

1992
02:33:21,303 --> 02:33:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this game wasn't really on my radar, but after playing it and...

1993
02:33:28,604 --> 02:33:30,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun, I gotta admit.

1994
02:33:30,866 --> 02:33:32,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it easy to pick up?

1995
02:33:32,187 --> 02:33:36,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know the problem with a lot of flight simulators is that I don't know how to fly a fucking plane.

1996
02:33:37,212 --> 02:33:44,639
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a flight simulator, and if you don't know the proper sequence to turn the plane on to get it to take off, you're not going anywhere in that game.

1997
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:47,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Or does Microsoft Flight kind of simplify that?

1998
02:33:47,970 --> 02:33:48,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1999
02:33:48,871 --> 02:33:55,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they did was they had a setup on a PC, but they had an Xbox 360 controller connected to the PC.

2000
02:33:56,495 --> 02:33:59,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the developers was there.

2001
02:34:00,157 --> 02:34:04,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, he had these bunch of challenges.

2002
02:34:04,839 --> 02:34:10,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really, using just the Xbox 360 controller, it was really simplified controls.

2003
02:34:10,922 --> 02:34:13,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes flying a plane way easier.

2004
02:34:13,704 --> 02:34:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

2005
02:34:15,069 --> 02:34:17,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Much easier than I thought it would be.

2006
02:34:17,891 --> 02:34:18,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2007
02:34:19,692 --> 02:34:21,553
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was really fun.

2008
02:34:21,593 --> 02:34:26,796
[SPEAKER_02]: They had really basic stuff like how to take off and how to land.

2009
02:34:26,816 --> 02:34:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had some fun stuff like how to collect all these little fly-through rings and stuff.

2010
02:34:33,959 --> 02:34:34,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like that.

2011
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:37,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't that one of the stages in Pilotwings?

2012
02:34:37,562 --> 02:34:38,743
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

2013
02:34:38,783 --> 02:34:40,384
[SPEAKER_07]: But very good-looking graphics, I assume.

2014
02:34:40,404 --> 02:34:45,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember flight simulators were always really good demonstrators of graphical capabilities.

2015
02:34:45,267 --> 02:34:46,728
[SPEAKER_07]: That was also one of the stages in Superman 64.

2016
02:34:46,768 --> 02:34:47,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shut up.

2017
02:34:51,571 --> 02:34:51,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

2018
02:34:52,672 --> 02:34:55,674
[SPEAKER_07]: How big of a presence does video gaming have at CES?

2019
02:34:55,694 --> 02:34:58,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're usually told that it's not there as much as you'd think.

2020
02:34:59,477 --> 02:35:01,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, that's an accurate statement.

2021
02:35:01,078 --> 02:35:02,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not big.

2022
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:08,644
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of video game related stuff, obviously at the Microsoft booth.

2023
02:35:09,862 --> 02:35:11,664
[SPEAKER_02]: and at the Sony booth as well.

2024
02:35:12,224 --> 02:35:13,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are pretty obvious.

2025
02:35:13,265 --> 02:35:19,390
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, like you couldn't really find anything else that were video game related.

2026
02:35:20,431 --> 02:35:25,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are like really the only two booths that you could go to to play actual video games.

2027
02:35:25,535 --> 02:35:25,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

2028
02:35:26,275 --> 02:35:31,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there anything just, you know, since we're all nerds here at OLR, was there anything that kind of jumped out at you?

2029
02:35:31,059 --> 02:35:33,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, wow, this is something I really want in my living room.

2030
02:35:33,241 --> 02:35:38,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Like even if it's not necessarily gaming related, was there any device that just made you go like, dang, I want one of these next Christmas?

2031
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:43,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell you the truth, not really.

2032
02:35:43,912 --> 02:35:52,137
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a lot of random cool stuff that was probably not ready for a consumer level until a few years down the line.

2033
02:35:52,477 --> 02:35:53,457
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all too damn expensive.

2034
02:35:53,818 --> 02:35:57,240
[SPEAKER_07]: How does one of those 100-foot HDTVs look in person?

2035
02:35:57,947 --> 02:35:59,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty sweet, gotta admit.

2036
02:36:01,269 --> 02:36:04,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing that in person was pretty eye-opening there.

2037
02:36:05,771 --> 02:36:06,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, awesome.

2038
02:36:07,051 --> 02:36:11,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, does the Porn Expo still go on next door at the same time, or did that change now?

2039
02:36:12,614 --> 02:36:18,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, that one, the original Porn Expo, now it's on the week after CES.

2040
02:36:19,417 --> 02:36:24,640
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this completely separate company is doing another adult

2041
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:27,220
[SPEAKER_02]: and convention things.

2042
02:36:27,401 --> 02:36:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the same time.

2043
02:36:28,221 --> 02:36:30,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, tapping into that market.

2044
02:36:30,281 --> 02:36:32,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Back-to-back adult cons in Las Vegas.

2045
02:36:32,822 --> 02:36:34,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it can sustain.

2046
02:36:34,963 --> 02:36:35,583
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2047
02:36:37,103 --> 02:36:37,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Good time.

2048
02:36:37,563 --> 02:36:39,124
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these days I got to make it to CES.

2049
02:36:39,164 --> 02:36:42,885
[SPEAKER_07]: That's got to be on my bucket list of things to do at some point.

2050
02:36:43,445 --> 02:36:44,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have to be industry to get into CES?

2051
02:36:44,905 --> 02:36:45,826
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think so.

2052
02:36:46,206 --> 02:36:46,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you did.

2053
02:36:47,306 --> 02:36:47,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

2054
02:36:47,466 --> 02:36:49,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically you do, but it's pretty easy.

2055
02:36:50,507 --> 02:36:51,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the old E3, it's really easy?

2056
02:36:52,347 --> 02:36:53,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty easy.

2057
02:36:53,508 --> 02:36:54,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, very cool.

2058
02:36:54,488 --> 02:36:56,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, VidPower, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

2059
02:36:57,510 --> 02:37:02,554
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kind of giving you guys a quick gaming summary over at CES.

2060
02:37:02,975 --> 02:37:04,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some of the other house party games.

2061
02:37:04,976 --> 02:37:05,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

2062
02:37:06,517 --> 02:37:08,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I Am Alive is good stuff.

2063
02:37:08,319 --> 02:37:09,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed that.

2064
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:10,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fun.

2065
02:37:10,981 --> 02:37:12,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of Prince of Persia.

2066
02:37:13,975 --> 02:37:34,561
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh the the combat quote-unquote combat is uh remember playing uh Metal Gear Solid games and you know you can hold up people by pointing a gun at them the entire combat is kind of centered around like intimidating your opponents by pointing a gun at them so that's like really original and I had a lot of fun with that interesting did you play the new Alan Wake at all

2067
02:37:35,209 --> 02:37:36,510
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2068
02:37:55,607 --> 02:38:00,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it was kind of one of those games that sold gradually, from what I understand.

2069
02:38:00,275 --> 02:38:03,139
[SPEAKER_07]: It never really was the chart topper, but it lasted for a long time.

2070
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:03,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2071
02:38:05,936 --> 02:38:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, definitely.

2072
02:38:07,177 --> 02:38:13,223
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, VidPower, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls, hopefully, but thank you so much for the call, and maybe see you at CES 2013.

2073
02:38:14,404 --> 02:38:15,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, cool.

2074
02:38:15,165 --> 02:38:15,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

2075
02:38:15,786 --> 02:38:16,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

2076
02:38:17,167 --> 02:38:18,248
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Las Vegas.

2077
02:38:18,308 --> 02:38:19,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We have quite a few listeners in Las Vegas.

2078
02:38:19,810 --> 02:38:21,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a town I need to get back to and visit.

2079
02:38:21,311 --> 02:38:23,193
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably doesn't even look the same.

2080
02:38:23,594 --> 02:38:27,077
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the last time I was in Vegas was 2001, a long time ago.

2081
02:38:27,277 --> 02:38:29,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I went a few years ago.

2082
02:38:30,841 --> 02:38:32,942
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no tram the last time I was in Vegas.

2083
02:38:33,162 --> 02:38:36,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently they have like a whole tram thing that goes to all the big casinos now on the strip.

2084
02:38:38,225 --> 02:38:39,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think I was there when they had a tram.

2085
02:38:40,366 --> 02:38:42,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time I was there, we went and visited Zappos.

2086
02:38:43,568 --> 02:38:44,608
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an awesome company.

2087
02:38:44,809 --> 02:38:46,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Sahara... Oh, yeah.

2088
02:38:46,970 --> 02:38:47,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Zappos.

2089
02:38:47,630 --> 02:38:52,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's the... Their call center has a really big reputation.

2090
02:38:52,913 --> 02:38:54,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2091
02:38:54,574 --> 02:38:55,315
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking amazing.

2092
02:38:55,335 --> 02:38:57,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was a call center trainer for many, many years.

2093
02:38:57,396 --> 02:38:58,536
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a company I would love to get into.

2094
02:38:58,556 --> 02:38:59,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like...

2095
02:39:00,218 --> 02:39:01,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wish it worked.

2096
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:04,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a company a lot of folks modeled themselves after.

2097
02:39:04,765 --> 02:39:06,087
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a DVR machine in their building, by the way.

2098
02:39:06,107 --> 02:39:06,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they really?

2099
02:39:06,728 --> 02:39:07,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I played on it.

2100
02:39:07,749 --> 02:39:08,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

2101
02:39:08,370 --> 02:39:08,671
[SPEAKER_07]: What mix?

2102
02:39:09,244 --> 02:39:12,566
[SPEAKER_07]: It was... I think it was a max two, if I remember correctly.

2103
02:39:12,586 --> 02:39:13,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad.

2104
02:39:13,286 --> 02:39:13,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2105
02:39:13,426 --> 02:39:15,047
[SPEAKER_07]: You can stay fit on lunch breaks.

2106
02:39:15,787 --> 02:39:16,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

2107
02:39:16,787 --> 02:39:17,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

2108
02:39:17,188 --> 02:39:20,389
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2109
02:39:20,429 --> 02:39:21,289
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of tweet topics.

2110
02:39:21,369 --> 02:39:23,230
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have napping pods.

2111
02:39:24,111 --> 02:39:24,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

2112
02:39:24,751 --> 02:39:25,351
[SPEAKER_07]: They do.

2113
02:39:25,811 --> 02:39:26,692
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

2114
02:39:27,452 --> 02:39:34,415
[SPEAKER_06]: All their conference rooms are themed and each of their little rows and departments or wherever, they have themed... It's fucking amazing.

2115
02:39:34,495 --> 02:39:35,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seriously...

2116
02:39:36,056 --> 02:39:37,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Star Trek Experience Warp Core Breach

2117
02:40:01,267 --> 02:40:21,021
[SPEAKER_07]: that was the year 2000 that was October 2000 because I did two trips to Vegas like almost back to back and then I haven't been back in like 10 years but uh that was the first time I was ever drunk I was like 22 or 23 so you know but I was at the I know I totally missed the 21 years old thing go figure but uh yeah that was at the Star Trek experience and um

2118
02:40:22,282 --> 02:40:23,983
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't the first time I'd ever had alcohol.

2119
02:40:24,363 --> 02:40:25,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the first time I got drunk.

2120
02:40:26,405 --> 02:40:28,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And like a true nerd, it was at the Star Trek experience.

2121
02:40:29,266 --> 02:40:30,627
[SPEAKER_07]: The Borg thing wasn't even there.

2122
02:40:30,667 --> 02:40:31,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got to ride it.

2123
02:40:31,748 --> 02:40:33,329
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's all closed, which is sad.

2124
02:40:34,689 --> 02:40:36,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did one of the kitties finally come out?

2125
02:40:37,251 --> 02:40:37,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, to eat.

2126
02:40:38,131 --> 02:40:38,512
[SPEAKER_07]: To eat.

2127
02:40:39,812 --> 02:40:42,114
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, all right, I'll put up with Loki being here.

2128
02:40:42,154 --> 02:40:42,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Maruko's here.

2129
02:40:43,555 --> 02:40:43,815
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2130
02:40:44,655 --> 02:40:45,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try to take another call here.

2131
02:40:45,836 --> 02:40:46,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2132
02:40:46,797 --> 02:40:47,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2133
02:40:47,937 --> 02:40:48,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's Cinderwolf.

2134
02:40:49,098 --> 02:40:50,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up, Cinderwolf?

2135
02:40:50,059 --> 02:40:50,659
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2136
02:40:51,723 --> 02:40:52,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much.

2137
02:40:52,404 --> 02:40:55,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just figured I finally have time to actually catch the broadcast tonight.

2138
02:40:55,948 --> 02:40:58,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought I'd call in and say hi to everybody.

2139
02:40:59,051 --> 02:40:59,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello, hello.

2140
02:41:00,032 --> 02:41:01,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you from Canada, if I remember right?

2141
02:41:02,575 --> 02:41:02,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

2142
02:41:03,036 --> 02:41:03,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you've got it.

2143
02:41:04,197 --> 02:41:09,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you don't have a three-day weekend then because Martin Luther King is a very American holiday.

2144
02:41:09,062 --> 02:41:12,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So you just happen to have a late Sunday available, huh?

2145
02:41:13,496 --> 02:41:14,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

2146
02:41:14,337 --> 02:41:16,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually get about a half a day, really.

2147
02:41:17,080 --> 02:41:19,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Three quarters of a day a week between both jobs.

2148
02:41:19,623 --> 02:41:20,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright.

2149
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:21,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, wow, alright.

2150
02:41:21,886 --> 02:41:22,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So crazy, crazy.

2151
02:41:22,506 --> 02:41:24,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since you got a chance to call in, what do you want to talk about tonight?

2152
02:41:24,929 --> 02:41:27,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Any story or maybe something we missed?

2153
02:41:28,623 --> 02:41:29,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, I'm going to be very honest.

2154
02:41:30,024 --> 02:41:34,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I did actually miss quite a bit of the broadcast, so I'll actually have to go back and catch up on it tomorrow.

2155
02:41:35,006 --> 02:41:41,389
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about a game that I've been playing recently called Bastion, actually.

2156
02:41:41,849 --> 02:41:43,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, of course, Bastion.

2157
02:41:43,890 --> 02:41:45,510
[SPEAKER_07]: The Canadian launches the game.

2158
02:41:46,591 --> 02:41:47,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.

2159
02:41:47,391 --> 02:41:49,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much, yeah.

2160
02:41:49,432 --> 02:41:52,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I just double-checked my Skyrim count.

2161
02:41:52,733 --> 02:41:56,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Skyrim for about 180 hours over the past month and a half now.

2162
02:41:57,319 --> 02:42:21,729
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh actually the video card died so I'm borrowing a replacement from a buddy of mine can't run Skyrim but I can play Bastion of all things so well Bastion is you know not quite the cutting edge 3D graphics but sometimes it is not all about the graphics right no I mean it's not not at all in fact I find this sort of gaming revolution even though it's uh most of everything seems to be

2163
02:42:22,977 --> 02:42:25,680
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D and impressive graphics.

2164
02:42:25,780 --> 02:42:36,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I find there's still this growing movement to go old school or traditional sort of 2D with cell shading or that sort of thing.

2165
02:42:36,989 --> 02:42:37,990
[SPEAKER_03]: 2D side scrollers even.

2166
02:42:41,233 --> 02:42:45,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So what possessed you to decide to jump in and check out Bastion?

2167
02:42:46,778 --> 02:42:54,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually picked up the demo online through the 360 back before the console update with the dashboard.

2168
02:42:54,167 --> 02:42:56,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was sort of an update right in my face.

2169
02:42:56,109 --> 02:42:57,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you know, I love the artwork.

2170
02:42:57,851 --> 02:43:02,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually a major fan of artwork working actually at a comic shop as well.

2171
02:43:04,381 --> 02:43:05,361
[SPEAKER_03]: and it really stood out to me.

2172
02:43:05,401 --> 02:43:08,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the artwork is actually very fantastic, very amazing.

2173
02:43:10,123 --> 02:43:15,284
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like somebody's sketching the world and it just sort of comes to life and that stood out to me at the time.

2174
02:43:15,344 --> 02:43:19,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm playing this and I'm like, wow, the controls are very simplistic.

2175
02:43:19,165 --> 02:43:21,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an incredibly basic story.

2176
02:43:21,226 --> 02:43:24,707
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even need to know anything about the game to start getting into it.

2177
02:43:25,907 --> 02:43:32,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And even two hours into the game, you're still like, okay, I still don't know the entire backstory so it's sort of driving you to

2178
02:43:33,930 --> 02:43:39,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Really keep playing to find out how it's going to end and exactly what the calamity is.

2179
02:43:40,673 --> 02:43:48,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, a lot of folks have kind of talked about the narration in the game and how important that the whole narration and narrating it as it's unfolding.

2180
02:43:49,256 --> 02:43:53,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think the narration is something really unique to the game or are you kind of like, ah, this is gimmicky?

2181
02:43:55,119 --> 02:43:58,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I actually love the narration.

2182
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:00,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in a while it's kind of cheesy, but

2183
02:44:01,972 --> 02:44:06,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it really makes it feel almost kind of like, you know, like story time when you're a kid, so to speak.

2184
02:44:07,397 --> 02:44:13,224
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not enough that it's, or it's not so much that you're like, okay, this is really something that annoys me.

2185
02:44:13,744 --> 02:44:16,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, hey, actually, I never really thought of it that way.

2186
02:44:18,109 --> 02:44:19,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of deal when it hits when it hits a new point.

2187
02:44:20,786 --> 02:44:32,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're just like, well, you know, I kind of like the backstory dialogue when you're, you know, you smoke the little pipe, you go to this little area to essentially just grind and grind and grind, pick up your little crystal shards or fragments.

2188
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:37,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And in between each wave, there's a little piece of the kid's backstory in the background.

2189
02:44:37,425 --> 02:44:40,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, hey, that's kind of neat, bringing me up to speed on who I'm actually playing with.

2190
02:44:41,243 --> 02:45:04,024
[SPEAKER_07]: and I thought it was kind of interesting that like as you kind of put that center area together it can kind of change the way the narration is going to because each building that you build kind of changes you know you get a little different narration for that so yeah actually I found the narration did change a little bit between buildings but by the end of it you know you're like I'm I still have to be only about halfway through it but

2191
02:45:05,038 --> 02:45:10,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I find the narration really ends up the same because you end up building the same buildings by the end of it anyway.

2192
02:45:10,079 --> 02:45:10,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.

2193
02:45:11,219 --> 02:45:20,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way, there's a little bit of a sort of a multi-path, but it's still a very linear storyline, which there's nothing wrong with linear.

2194
02:45:20,721 --> 02:45:33,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way they've gone about the story kind of makes you think, well, you know, maybe if I play it a little bit differently later on, even though I know the ending, is it going to be more of a challenge or am I going to discover things I didn't know were there before?

2195
02:45:34,048 --> 02:45:39,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the game was really well developed in dragging and sucking you into it to see it through to the end.

2196
02:45:41,170 --> 02:45:47,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well it sounds like you are definitely enjoying Bastion, so are you hoping there's going to be a sequel?

2197
02:45:47,512 --> 02:45:48,392
[SPEAKER_07]: As if I need to ask?

2198
02:45:50,132 --> 02:45:50,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

2199
02:45:52,153 --> 02:45:53,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hope.

2200
02:45:53,293 --> 02:46:00,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there have been the rumors of Buzz online saying there is, saying there aren't, and you know, we just all have to sort of cross our fingers, but

2201
02:46:00,819 --> 02:46:05,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure once I finish this, I'll probably round Skyrim count up to 200 hours or so.

2202
02:46:07,296 --> 02:46:07,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, nice.

2203
02:46:08,296 --> 02:46:17,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Cinderwolf, thanks so much for the call and reminding us that Bastion might be one of those games you missed at the end of 2011 amongst all the Skyrim, so check it out.

2204
02:46:17,299 --> 02:46:19,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Cinderwolf, you have a good one and thanks so much for calling in.

2205
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:20,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

2206
02:46:20,860 --> 02:46:21,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2207
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:21,880
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys too.

2208
02:46:22,761 --> 02:46:25,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Oop, he cut out there at the end, but we'll just hope he said something nice.

2209
02:46:26,062 --> 02:46:31,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio if you want to give us a call.

2210
02:46:31,103 --> 02:46:32,463
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got time for about one more call.

2211
02:46:32,824 --> 02:46:33,984
[SPEAKER_07]: We can fit in one more call, right?

2212
02:46:34,605 --> 02:46:40,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, Alan, while you were AFK, your kitties are finally starting to integrate with the show a little bit.

2213
02:46:40,733 --> 02:46:44,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a matter of time before we get Maruko on air with a comment.

2214
02:46:45,059 --> 02:46:46,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, that means they're warming up to you.

2215
02:46:46,261 --> 02:46:47,622
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, this guy ain't gonna leave.

2216
02:46:48,123 --> 02:46:49,986
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, it's been three hours and we're hungry.

2217
02:46:51,997 --> 02:46:53,298
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to just come out to the food dish.

2218
02:46:54,840 --> 02:47:00,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the chatters are asking for pictures, so I'll have to take one and put it on the website.

2219
02:47:00,444 --> 02:47:04,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have old pics, but... I have a Tumblr post that's bookmarked that I can link and chat.

2220
02:47:05,068 --> 02:47:05,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, do that.

2221
02:47:05,849 --> 02:47:07,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't be pictures from like right this second, though.

2222
02:47:10,231 --> 02:47:13,052
[SPEAKER_07]: My iPhone camera is fucked.

2223
02:47:13,172 --> 02:47:18,753
[SPEAKER_07]: The back camera, I think I scratched it or something, but there's too much exposure in one corner.

2224
02:47:19,493 --> 02:47:21,834
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks blurry and greasy and shitty.

2225
02:47:22,054 --> 02:47:24,114
[SPEAKER_05]: My touchscreen is starting to go out.

2226
02:47:24,974 --> 02:47:28,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Your main thumb button at the bottom doesn't wake it up either.

2227
02:47:28,955 --> 02:47:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I really need to get a new phone and technically I'm eligible for a free upgrade right now, but it's like I don't

2228
02:47:34,025 --> 02:47:35,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want a 4S, I want a 5.

2229
02:47:36,506 --> 02:47:37,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can wait it out, right?

2230
02:47:38,226 --> 02:47:38,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2231
02:47:38,626 --> 02:47:38,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

2232
02:47:39,707 --> 02:47:40,007
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2233
02:47:40,027 --> 02:47:43,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine, I think, is from my son dropping it on the floor over and over again.

2234
02:47:43,388 --> 02:47:44,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you should punish him.

2235
02:47:44,728 --> 02:47:45,328
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm just kidding.

2236
02:47:45,348 --> 02:47:46,949
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we got time for about one more call.

2237
02:47:46,969 --> 02:47:48,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's try to get one more call.

2238
02:47:48,209 --> 02:47:49,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2239
02:47:49,150 --> 02:47:49,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2240
02:47:50,330 --> 02:47:51,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, this is Yuni.

2241
02:47:51,550 --> 02:47:52,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Yuni.

2242
02:47:53,031 --> 02:47:55,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight is like long time no talk night.

2243
02:47:55,692 --> 02:47:58,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Like all these people that are calling in, I haven't heard from them forever.

2244
02:47:58,152 --> 02:47:58,733
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.

2245
02:47:58,973 --> 02:47:59,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how are you, Yuni?

2246
02:48:00,487 --> 02:48:04,348
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good, I have laryngitis, so forgive me if I sound weird.

2247
02:48:04,728 --> 02:48:11,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright, I'm just glad, you know, amongst all the comments of tonight being a sausage fest, I'm glad we get a lovely lady calling in.

2248
02:48:11,470 --> 02:48:15,491
[SPEAKER_05]: This weekend we hung out with someone who probably has strep, so.

2249
02:48:15,611 --> 02:48:16,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it's not strep.

2250
02:48:17,531 --> 02:48:21,172
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a matter of time before I am sick too, probably for the next show I'll be coming in here.

2251
02:48:21,952 --> 02:48:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: and ZR5 Radio.

2252
02:48:23,253 --> 02:48:26,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mr. Spanky will be making a return.

2253
02:48:27,614 --> 02:48:28,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mr. Spanky will make a return.

2254
02:48:28,995 --> 02:48:29,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Uni, I'm sorry.

2255
02:48:29,755 --> 02:48:30,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to derail.

2256
02:48:30,936 --> 02:48:32,116
[SPEAKER_07]: To what do we owe this phone call tonight?

2257
02:48:32,136 --> 02:48:32,597
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

2258
02:48:33,357 --> 02:48:37,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I just missed you guys and I haven't heard you guys in forever.

2259
02:48:38,749 --> 02:48:42,550
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were wishing Joe a happy birthday, which is Dark Tetsuya, sorry.

2260
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:44,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday, Joe.

2261
02:48:44,171 --> 02:48:45,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it is a little late, but I know.

2262
02:48:46,091 --> 02:48:53,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I did go over to his Facebook and I did the appropriate because, you know, he loves it when John does this to me, the Rob, Rob, Rob thing.

2263
02:48:53,313 --> 02:48:55,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went to his wall and said, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.

2264
02:48:56,154 --> 02:48:56,414
What?

2265
02:48:57,134 --> 02:48:58,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday.

2266
02:49:00,589 --> 02:49:02,332
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2267
02:49:18,292 --> 02:49:18,852
[SPEAKER_00]: 7 actually.

2268
02:49:18,952 --> 02:49:20,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been on the air.

2269
02:49:20,074 --> 02:49:21,115
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our 10th year.

2270
02:49:21,676 --> 02:49:22,797
[SPEAKER_07]: June will be 10 years.

2271
02:49:22,877 --> 02:49:23,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

2272
02:49:24,158 --> 02:49:26,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I started listening in year 3.

2273
02:49:28,383 --> 02:49:31,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So at least... So did I. Even though a lot...

2274
02:49:33,709 --> 02:49:33,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so

2275
02:50:02,128 --> 02:50:04,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni, what video games do you play these days?

2276
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:07,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I play World of Warcraft and Argent Dawn.

2277
02:50:07,912 --> 02:50:09,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I have eight 85s.

2278
02:50:09,974 --> 02:50:12,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that's great.

2279
02:50:12,355 --> 02:50:12,736
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2280
02:50:13,116 --> 02:50:19,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I have noticed with this expansion, it's really easy for people to be in that multiple 85 camp now.

2281
02:50:20,101 --> 02:50:22,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I never thought I would have more than one, and I have four.

2282
02:50:22,243 --> 02:50:24,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I have four 85s on three different servers.

2283
02:50:26,998 --> 02:50:35,013
[SPEAKER_00]: I also play StarCraft 2 I'm bronze rank but I play Protoss I need advice how do I get good at StarCraft 2?

2284
02:50:36,922 --> 02:50:38,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on your economy.

2285
02:50:38,643 --> 02:50:43,284
[SPEAKER_00]: You focus on putting... Okay, I'm just going to say this.

2286
02:50:43,764 --> 02:50:47,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Drones, probes, SUVs, whichever you play.

2287
02:50:47,885 --> 02:50:49,465
[SPEAKER_00]: If you play Terran, it's SUVs.

2288
02:50:49,845 --> 02:50:53,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what you do is you constantly pump those out.

2289
02:50:53,766 --> 02:50:57,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Like around five minutes, you make your next expansion.

2290
02:50:57,947 --> 02:50:59,547
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a whole entire build order.

2291
02:50:59,607 --> 02:51:01,588
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about build order.

2292
02:51:02,088 --> 02:51:03,190
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2293
02:51:18,750 --> 02:51:20,871
[SPEAKER_00]: It smushes their faces in.

2294
02:51:21,091 --> 02:51:22,791
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like hilarious.

2295
02:51:22,831 --> 02:51:23,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's all about.

2296
02:51:23,911 --> 02:51:26,192
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my favorite thing.

2297
02:51:26,252 --> 02:51:31,353
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to think I'm such a dumbass, but this is my favorite thing in StarCraft II is Star Jeweled.

2298
02:51:31,533 --> 02:51:32,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever played Star Jeweled?

2299
02:51:33,213 --> 02:51:33,554
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

2300
02:51:33,814 --> 02:51:34,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you've got to check it out.

2301
02:51:34,934 --> 02:51:36,714
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Bejeweled, and it's free.

2302
02:51:36,794 --> 02:51:38,375
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like one of the custom maps.

2303
02:51:38,475 --> 02:51:39,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go look for it.

2304
02:51:39,195 --> 02:51:40,055
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Blizzard map.

2305
02:51:40,395 --> 02:51:43,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Star Jeweled, and it mixes Bejeweled and StarCraft.

2306
02:51:46,296 --> 02:51:47,638
[SPEAKER_07]: After the show, you've got to go check it out.

2307
02:51:48,499 --> 02:51:50,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you this real quick before we say goodbye.

2308
02:51:51,463 --> 02:51:55,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart of the Swarm coming out soon, hopefully soon-ish.

2309
02:51:55,648 --> 02:51:57,371
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you most looking forward to in Heart of the Swarm?

2310
02:51:58,705 --> 02:52:01,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly looking forward to Diablo 3.

2311
02:52:01,906 --> 02:52:07,127
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest one is going to be awesome, but I'm more looking forward to Diablo 3.

2312
02:52:07,607 --> 02:52:08,387
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2313
02:52:08,728 --> 02:52:09,628
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a fair answer.

2314
02:52:09,808 --> 02:52:11,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm in the same boat.

2315
02:52:11,528 --> 02:52:13,969
[SPEAKER_07]: StarCraft 2, it's alright, but Diablo 3, bring it on.

2316
02:52:14,009 --> 02:52:16,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been able to play the beta at all?

2317
02:52:18,190 --> 02:52:19,490
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not in the beta.

2318
02:52:19,610 --> 02:52:20,310
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was.

2319
02:52:21,131 --> 02:52:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to rub it in, but I did get in the beta a few months ago, so I have played through it, and it's very nice.

2320
02:52:27,248 --> 02:52:28,069
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.

2321
02:52:28,269 --> 02:52:29,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hate you.

2322
02:52:29,129 --> 02:52:29,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, Rob.

2323
02:52:31,651 --> 02:52:33,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let you go if you want.

2324
02:52:33,572 --> 02:52:33,852
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2325
02:52:33,892 --> 02:52:34,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

2326
02:52:34,572 --> 02:52:35,413
[SPEAKER_07]: We better wrap up the show.

2327
02:52:35,453 --> 02:52:38,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It's after 9 o'clock or midnight for you East Coast folks.

2328
02:52:38,515 --> 02:52:38,795
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2329
02:52:39,315 --> 02:52:39,835
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll let you go.

2330
02:52:39,995 --> 02:52:41,436
[SPEAKER_07]: But thanks so much for calling in and saying hello.

2331
02:52:42,917 --> 02:52:43,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2332
02:52:43,277 --> 02:52:43,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2333
02:52:43,858 --> 02:52:44,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

2334
02:52:44,438 --> 02:52:44,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun.

2335
02:52:45,118 --> 02:52:46,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, Star Jeweled.

2336
02:52:46,419 --> 02:52:46,659
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2337
02:52:46,699 --> 02:52:46,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2338
02:52:47,079 --> 02:52:47,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2339
02:52:47,660 --> 02:52:47,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2340
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:50,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, IyerChef is a lot of fun, too.

2341
02:52:51,042 --> 02:52:53,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a Left 4 Dead one, too.

2342
02:52:53,623 --> 02:52:56,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Left... I can't remember the name.

2343
02:52:56,746 --> 02:52:58,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Left 4 something else.

2344
02:52:58,127 --> 02:52:58,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Just look for that.

2345
02:53:01,089 --> 02:53:03,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody in chat will scream it out in a minute here.

2346
02:53:03,511 --> 02:53:04,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we gotta wrap up.

2347
02:53:06,048 --> 02:53:06,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for the calls.

2348
02:53:07,109 --> 02:53:12,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, although I gotta say that was an awesome night of Skype calls because we got to talk to like three people we haven't talked to in a long time.

2349
02:53:14,655 --> 02:53:20,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Email bag is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com You could leave us a voicemail on the Skype line.

2350
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:23,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we do play those if they're concise and to the point.

2351
02:53:25,244 --> 02:53:31,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We only had two emails tonight, so those of you that didn't get through, get your... Excuse me.

2352
02:53:33,775 --> 02:53:35,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, radio's worst nightmare, the hiccups.

2353
02:53:35,997 --> 02:53:39,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your thoughts in via email and we'll get those on the next show.

2354
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:44,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, before we really put the bow on the show tonight and say we're done, I need to go over to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.

2355
02:53:44,705 --> 02:53:45,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Alan.

2356
02:53:45,569 --> 02:53:51,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, THQ has come out and they've released a statement saying, no, they have not cancelled their 2014 lineup.

2357
02:53:52,494 --> 02:54:05,024
[SPEAKER_06]: They are saying, additionally, we are thrilled with the great performance of Saints Row the Third, which on a like for the period in North America has tripled in sell-through from Saints Row 2.

2358
02:54:05,304 --> 02:54:09,247
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, WWE 12's worldwide sales are up 40% year over year.

2359
02:54:11,008 --> 02:54:17,374
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as, according to the NPD, in the month of December, THQ was number five publisher overall, number four third party.

2360
02:54:17,895 --> 02:54:21,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they reported growth of 18% in the market.

2361
02:54:21,478 --> 02:54:22,299
[SPEAKER_06]: That was down almost 6%.

2362
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:24,421
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, there you go.

2363
02:54:24,561 --> 02:54:26,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki with breaking news here on OLR.

2364
02:54:26,764 --> 02:54:27,064
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR.

2365
02:54:38,086 --> 02:54:38,947
[SPEAKER_07]: THQ's not dead.

2366
02:54:39,347 --> 02:54:39,727
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

2367
02:54:40,888 --> 02:54:41,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't think so.

2368
02:54:41,509 --> 02:54:43,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're one of the major publishers out there.

2369
02:54:43,991 --> 02:54:49,336
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's any publisher that's gonna die, it would be... Okay, let me think.

2370
02:54:49,456 --> 02:54:50,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Semi... Atari.

2371
02:54:50,717 --> 02:54:52,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Atari's the next fucking publisher to go.

2372
02:54:52,679 --> 02:54:54,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're like clinging onto the grave.

2373
02:54:54,840 --> 02:54:56,282
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what we need here at OLR?

2374
02:54:56,342 --> 02:54:59,324
[SPEAKER_07]: We need the... I mean, this is kind of a sad game to play, though, but I don't know.

2375
02:54:59,624 --> 02:55:04,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's always sad when studios close, but we do kind of need the publisher death pool.

2376
02:55:05,450 --> 02:55:07,191
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how they have the celebrity death pool?

2377
02:55:07,571 --> 02:55:09,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Like which celebrity is going to kick the bucket next?

2378
02:55:09,151 --> 02:55:10,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Rotten.com has that, if you remember that site.

2379
02:55:11,812 --> 02:55:13,473
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still around, aren't they?

2380
02:55:13,593 --> 02:55:16,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's all that Atari has coming right now.

2381
02:55:16,734 --> 02:55:23,037
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Test Drive Ferrari Legends, which is Test Drive Unlimited.

2382
02:55:24,417 --> 02:55:29,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And also The Witcher 2, which is going to be coming to the consoles next.

2383
02:55:29,699 --> 02:55:34,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, The Witcher 2 did well on PC, but, dude, that's all they have.

2384
02:55:34,682 --> 02:55:39,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe, no, no, no, they're not doing any more Dragon Ball games.

2385
02:55:39,845 --> 02:55:40,305
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2386
02:55:40,385 --> 02:55:41,185
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they have.

2387
02:55:41,305 --> 02:55:42,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's not a lot coming out.

2388
02:55:44,507 --> 02:55:44,867
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2389
02:55:45,728 --> 02:55:47,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we need to have that here.

2390
02:55:47,208 --> 02:55:52,711
[SPEAKER_07]: That can be a segment on another Slow News Week, the publisher death pool.

2391
02:55:54,232 --> 02:55:57,254
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see, take bets on which publisher's going to fold before the end of the year.

2392
02:55:57,274 --> 02:55:59,155
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, any other breaking news, or was that it?

2393
02:56:02,053 --> 02:56:08,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is not news, but the RetroDuo portable, the NES SNES portable system looks pretty sweet.

2394
02:56:10,183 --> 02:56:10,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

2395
02:56:11,024 --> 02:56:13,467
[SPEAKER_07]: The technology patent on that's expired.

2396
02:56:13,527 --> 02:56:19,073
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to start seeing, just like you see all the Nintendo rip-offs now, you're going to start seeing Super Nintendo ones all over the place pretty soon.

2397
02:56:19,994 --> 02:56:21,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So, alrighty.

2398
02:56:23,806 --> 02:56:26,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, I'm assuming you don't have any last minute stories tonight?

2399
02:56:26,489 --> 02:56:26,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

2400
02:56:26,890 --> 02:56:27,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I figured it.

2401
02:56:27,570 --> 02:56:29,953
[SPEAKER_07]: But you do have pictures of cute kitties that I saw in the chat room.

2402
02:56:30,053 --> 02:56:30,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2403
02:56:30,374 --> 02:56:30,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2404
02:56:31,215 --> 02:56:38,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, maybe, I don't know if Ranma can do this, but maybe he can reblog that over to the OLR Tumblr so everybody can see the kitties.

2405
02:56:38,824 --> 02:56:38,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2406
02:56:39,165 --> 02:56:39,565
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be great.

2407
02:56:40,126 --> 02:56:40,366
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2408
02:56:41,707 --> 02:56:43,929
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to do it then for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2409
02:56:43,989 --> 02:56:46,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us tonight.

2410
02:56:47,252 --> 02:56:48,153
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what we say, guys.

2411
02:56:48,333 --> 02:56:51,435
[SPEAKER_07]: If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, all we do, we ask, tell a friend.

2412
02:56:51,836 --> 02:56:52,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2413
02:56:52,236 --> 02:56:58,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Just say, hey, there's this show out there and they don't have a big magazine backing them or a website that gets hundreds of millions of hits.

2414
02:56:58,881 --> 02:57:01,523
[SPEAKER_07]: But you should check them out because it's a fun time and come join us and chat sometime.

2415
02:57:01,543 --> 02:57:02,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So help us spread the word.

2416
02:57:03,185 --> 02:57:04,106
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do that by telling friends.

2417
02:57:04,406 --> 02:57:05,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave a nice review on iTunes.

2418
02:57:05,887 --> 02:57:06,828
[SPEAKER_07]: We always appreciate that too.

2419
02:57:07,428 --> 02:57:12,192
[SPEAKER_07]: or, you know, just a little shout out in your signature on a forum or whatever.

2420
02:57:12,793 --> 02:57:15,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate all the word of mouth that we can get.

2421
02:57:15,074 --> 02:57:16,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys again.

2422
02:57:16,395 --> 02:57:17,136
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate it.

2423
02:57:17,697 --> 02:57:19,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2424
02:57:19,878 --> 02:57:22,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, thank you so much for filling in at the last minute yet again.

2425
02:57:22,861 --> 02:57:23,962
[SPEAKER_07]: You've done that twice this month.

2426
02:57:24,062 --> 02:57:24,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

2427
02:57:24,622 --> 02:57:25,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I owe you.

2428
02:57:26,604 --> 02:57:28,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

2429
02:57:29,066 --> 02:57:30,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for letting me use your laptop.

2430
02:57:31,408 --> 02:57:31,888
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

2431
02:57:32,248 --> 02:57:35,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm making orange chicken.

2432
02:57:36,373 --> 02:58:00,794
[SPEAKER_07]: mmm can't wait and steamed rice delicious we're gonna eat that after the show wraps nom nom nom let's see my final thought is I just realized we have two posters in here that say haters to the left and one points one way and one points the other so I'm confused which way did the haters go because they're on opposite walls either out the front door or into the kitchen to cook for us okay fair enough I'm gonna say into the oven oh my god

2433
02:58:03,107 --> 02:58:04,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the witch, like a Tansel and Gretel.

2434
02:58:05,128 --> 02:58:07,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2435
02:58:08,249 --> 02:58:12,231
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I really don't want to eat McDonald's anymore.

2436
02:58:12,872 --> 02:58:13,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to stop.

2437
02:58:14,452 --> 02:58:16,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a late New Year's resolution?

2438
02:58:16,513 --> 02:58:17,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what I'm hearing over there?

2439
02:58:17,414 --> 02:58:20,175
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's been one I've been toiling around, and I was actually going to do that.

2440
02:58:20,415 --> 02:58:26,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just running a little bit late this evening, so there wasn't really any time for me to stop anywhere else.

2441
02:58:26,538 --> 02:58:29,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have heated up some soup, but I didn't have a lot of time to do that.

2442
02:58:30,179 --> 02:58:30,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I made this

2443
02:58:31,880 --> 02:58:33,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheddar and beer soup.

2444
02:58:33,781 --> 02:58:39,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care for it too much, though, because the beer didn't cook out.

2445
02:58:40,305 --> 02:58:45,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's got a lot of, you know, if you drink the whole pot of it, I guess you can get a little bit buzzed.

2446
02:58:45,848 --> 02:58:49,970
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't quite how I had pictured it.

2447
02:58:49,990 --> 02:58:51,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I put too many leaks in it, too.

2448
02:58:51,190 --> 02:58:51,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too sweet.

2449
02:58:52,891 --> 02:58:53,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2450
02:58:53,832 --> 02:58:56,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm laughing at what Actdeft said in chat.

2451
02:58:56,513 --> 02:58:59,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm assuming this is about the haters to the left sign that points to the kitchen.

2452
02:59:00,375 --> 02:59:01,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Haters gonna bake.

2453
02:59:03,491 --> 02:59:05,772
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2454
02:59:28,724 --> 02:59:31,426
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
