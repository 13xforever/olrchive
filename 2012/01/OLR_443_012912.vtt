Tonight, January 29, 2012, a network makeover is rumored for Nintendo consoles, a new handheld

00:21.000 --> 00:31.600
may bring back a classic gaming system, and Steam goes mobile with a new iOS app.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.160 --> 00:39.040
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.040 --> 00:47.720
We are live on this January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.720
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.360
First off, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
Hi.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
How are you, Miss Summers?

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
Been better.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
Been better?

00:59.360 --> 01:05.120
It's kind of a gloomy Sunday, Sunday Bloody Sunday, like the U2 song.

01:05.120 --> 01:14.960
No, there's no big massacres and wars going on in my house and I don't live in Ireland

01:14.960 --> 01:18.080
as people I'm sure would know that's what the song was about.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.800
That was not a PMS joke because that would be gross.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.960
I could say it's Shark Week.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.040
Are the communists invading?

01:28.040 --> 01:29.440
That's none of anyone's business.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.440
However, I am very pissy.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
I'm sorry.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.120
Well, so this week everybody better be extra careful on their spelling and grammar because

01:36.120 --> 01:39.760
remember it's those little things that'll tick her off unless she gets chocolate.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.560
Everything has been pissing me off today, so it's going to be a great show.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.560
I'm sorry.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.600
I didn't help because we were supposed to have a Pinkberry date today and I had to cancel

01:47.600 --> 01:53.320
because my mommy just had surgery and I know she doesn't listen to the show, but I'm thinking

01:53.320 --> 01:54.320
about my mother.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.040
She had surgery on Friday, but she's doing a lot better, so I had to go visit her today

01:58.040 --> 02:00.760
because she's out of the hospital.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.000
Anyhow, let's talk about who else is here with us here in studio.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.520
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.520
Hi.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.520
How are you, Techmaster Loki?

02:07.520 --> 02:08.520
I'm fine.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.520
Are you on your period or are we good?

02:09.520 --> 02:12.280
I'm fine, I guess.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.440
You're always angry on this show no matter what it is.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.080
I was like, I don't know how to answer that.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.080
Yes.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.520
What's new with Loki?

02:20.520 --> 02:23.080
Um, not much.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.080
Just playing Skyrim.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
All right.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.840
Well, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit, but first I have to plug

02:27.840 --> 02:33.600
of course the lovely All Games Radio where we do our show every week, www.allgames.com

02:33.600 --> 02:37.420
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:37.420 --> 02:38.860
It is where we tape live.

02:38.860 --> 02:42.680
If you are listening live, and we hope you do sometime if you are been listening on the

02:42.680 --> 02:46.280
podcast all these years, if you are listening live, join us in our chat room.

02:46.280 --> 02:51.080
Just point your browsers over to chat dot orange lounge radio.com and there's a fine

02:51.080 --> 02:53.960
little Java chat room that will open right up and you can join our chat room.

02:53.960 --> 02:57.600
If you prefer to do it the old school way, you can do it with an IRC client still because

02:57.600 --> 03:02.200
our chat rooms IRC based and you just want to connect to the game surge network at IRC

03:02.200 --> 03:08.480
dot game surge.net and we are in channel with the channel sign or the pound orange lounge

03:08.480 --> 03:10.560
is where you can find us on IRC.

03:10.560 --> 03:11.560
Hey Rob.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.560
Hey Rob.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.560
Yes ma'am.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.120
I have to share the neat thing that I just posted in the chat room.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
Okay.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.960
Apparently some nerd has narrowed down when Ice Cube's good day was.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.600
Like today was a good day?

03:22.600 --> 03:23.600
What day was it?

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
Well, I'll just.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
Wasn't today right?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.200
I'll go through just a quickie on this one.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.400
The clues were what they were watching UMTV wraps, which started on August 6th, 1988.

03:33.400 --> 03:38.480
The single was released on February 23rd, 93 and the Lakers beat the Supersonics.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.760
So they narrowed down all of those dates and then went to clue for the dates.

03:42.760 --> 03:46.720
The Laker wins over the Supersonics was a clear day with no smog.

03:46.720 --> 03:53.340
So they narrowed it down to November 30th, 88 and at the date in 89, 91 and 92 good Lord.

03:53.340 --> 03:55.240
Some people have too much free time.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.880
Clue five got a beep from Kim.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.440
So it was when beepers were available.

03:59.440 --> 04:06.800
So that led it to two dates, uh, January 18th, 91, January 20th, 92 clue six Ice Cube started

04:06.800 --> 04:11.720
filming boys in the hood in 1991 there was only one day I'm going to quote this only

04:11.720 --> 04:14.520
one day where UMTV wraps was on air.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.200
It was a clear and smog less day.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.960
Beepers were commercially sold Lakers beat the Supersonics and Ice Cube had no events

04:19.960 --> 04:26.160
to attend January 20th, 1992 national good day day.

04:26.160 --> 04:31.120
So we just celebrated 20 years of today was a good day 20 years ago.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.360
Yeah.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.260
What an incredibly useless piece of information, but I thought it was cool that someone went

04:36.260 --> 04:38.000
to the trouble and I wanted to share it.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
That's when the good day was.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And those, and for those listening to orange on radio for the first time, those are the

04:42.000 --> 04:46.400
lovely types of tidbits you can expect, but we will get into video games here in a minute.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.000
First I have to apologize to livelicious and the podcasters.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.600
There was no live show last week and it was a little bit last minute.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.160
We had to cancel the show due to illness and I was a little bit self-conscious about it

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
last week.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.680
I didn't want to talk about a whole lot, but I'll talk about it now.

04:58.680 --> 05:04.440
I had pink eye, which is why we didn't have the show last week or is what, what did Victoria

05:04.440 --> 05:06.360
call it I herps or something like that.

05:06.360 --> 05:15.480
Look dark soccer just choked on her soda when I said that.

05:15.480 --> 05:19.960
It's like, what am I seven and going to a preschool where kids are putting fingers in

05:19.960 --> 05:21.920
their butt and their eye or something.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.520
No, I work in a place with adults and stuff.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.520
I don't know.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.720
We had a pink eye outbreak at work.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.200
It just ended plague.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.600
I don't know what happened.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.100
Someone got careless with the mascara.

05:32.100 --> 05:38.000
I got pink because I w I do work with primarily women and I got pink guy just cause everybody

05:38.000 --> 05:39.280
else in the office had it.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.560
So unfortunately what that means is that nobody wants to come over to Rob's house where the

05:43.560 --> 05:48.120
studio is or touch the equipment and everything like that because he has pink eye and when

05:48.120 --> 05:52.240
one co-host has a kid at home and you know, the other just doesn't want pink eye, it kind

05:52.240 --> 05:53.480
of fucks up the show for the night.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.000
Oh no, you are, you, I was eating cheesecake.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.320
Fuck your pink eye.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.980
You had something else going on anyway.

06:01.980 --> 06:06.360
You were going to miss two weeks in a row anyway because there was a, a family deal.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
Yeah.

06:07.360 --> 06:15.320
And um, I, uh, it was a cousin's birthday at the cheesecake factory and I had fantastic

06:15.320 --> 06:18.380
carrot cake cheesecake and Dan had food poisoning.

06:18.380 --> 06:22.880
So um, and of course our chat room is lighting up pink guy, what the hell?

06:22.880 --> 06:25.440
And uh, Kai's Judo's like, all it was, was pink eye WTF.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.440
Yes.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.180
But you have to remember pink eye is super duper contagious.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.880
Like it's not like I lick the eyes of these women I work with.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.480
Like if you touch something they've touched, you can get it like break room stuff, you

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
know?

06:38.480 --> 06:46.340
So, so yeah, yeah, yet Alan who lives here with me never got it.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.840
So I don't know what that's about.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.360
Maybe you have natural immunity to the undead plague.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.800
You will be the salvation of us all.

06:53.800 --> 06:58.840
And I actually wiped down all of the mics and the studio area with Clark's wipes to

06:58.840 --> 06:59.840
make sure.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
You're so considerate.

07:00.840 --> 07:01.840
Yeah.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.840
I never got pink eye.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.840
So Rob's lying.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
This whole story is a lie.

07:04.840 --> 07:10.200
I had a very, very minor case of pink eye and yet it was like Alan went through here

07:10.200 --> 07:14.440
in a hazmat suit making sure he would not get it no matter what happened.

07:14.440 --> 07:21.840
So um, uh, Hamakara in our chat room at chat.orange.com says someone wasn't washing their hands after

07:21.840 --> 07:22.840
using the potty.

07:22.840 --> 07:23.840
Okay.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.400
First off, I find that to be one of the most disgusting habits of men that I see in the

07:27.400 --> 07:33.080
potty is that I see guys who just walk in the restroom, do their thing, walk right out.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.080
They don't even flush.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.080
They don't even stop to walk, wash their hands.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.840
And if that's you, especially if they're handling their junk or something, you know, and you

07:39.840 --> 07:40.840
know who you are.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.840
That's gross.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.640
A flush B wash.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.640
It's not that hard.

07:45.640 --> 07:52.080
Although I will say it has been proven that the place with the most germs on the body

07:52.080 --> 07:54.860
is actually the mouth and the hands.

07:54.860 --> 07:57.600
So you were right about not washing the hands regularly.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.760
However the butt is one of the cleanest places.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.780
Thank you for that piece of information.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.880
So what have I learned today?

08:04.880 --> 08:09.180
January 20th was a good day and my ass is kind of clean after all.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.180
Thank you.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.180
And urine is sterile.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.180
All right.

08:12.180 --> 08:16.800
Anyhow, I don't want to talk about my goddamn pink eye anymore.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.640
Let's talk about, uh, let's talk about gaming.

08:19.640 --> 08:20.720
I don't want to get into our gaming weeks.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.520
I want to get right into the gaming news tonight or actually we can talk about one of two things

08:24.520 --> 08:30.040
because we could talk about what's going on with Xbox and all these rumors about the new

08:30.040 --> 08:33.560
Xbox and, and the, the used games and all that.

08:33.560 --> 08:37.760
Or we could talk about RuPaul's drag race season four premiers tomorrow, which is the

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
best show on television.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
Am I right?

08:39.760 --> 08:40.760
Dark soccer.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.760
Yeah, but there's really nothing.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.520
I interviewed Tatiana once.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.460
There's really nothing to talk about until it airs though.

08:46.460 --> 08:50.400
That's true, but we can, so I guess, I guess we'll, we'll just combine the two worlds a

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
little bit.

08:51.400 --> 09:14.560
I tried, all right, so going around an Xbox bullshit this week, I don't know.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.080
It might be true, but look, I, it's the pink elephant in the room.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
Everybody's talking about it.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.840
It's the whole, the new Xbox, which we're called, we will not call it the Xbox 720 here

09:23.840 --> 09:24.840
on orange on radio.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.840
I'm sorry.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.840
That's not what it's going to be called.

09:26.840 --> 09:31.000
We already decided weeks ago amongst a highly scientific process, we will refer to the system

09:31.000 --> 09:34.120
as the Xbox lube until Microsoft gives us something better.

09:34.120 --> 09:39.180
So the Xbox lube supposedly is not going to play, use games whatsoever that I guess there's

09:39.180 --> 09:46.920
this amazing technology that will just fuck your disc up once you install a game or something

09:46.920 --> 09:51.480
like Loki clue us all in, how is this technology supposed to work from what I don't fucking

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
know.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
It doesn't exist.

09:53.480 --> 09:58.920
So how am I, it's going to use these cardboard rings.

09:58.920 --> 10:04.500
Basically what happens is they'll prompt you to enter in, um, a special code that's generated

10:04.500 --> 10:10.440
by turning these rings so that, you know, you can create a certain phrase like for example,

10:10.440 --> 10:16.000
you know, banana monkey pirate, or you'll have to get out the instruction manual and

10:16.000 --> 10:23.780
look up the keyword on page 24, some of which may actually require the use of a decoder

10:23.780 --> 10:32.360
device that will be a red plastic, a transparent piece of, um, of, uh, yeah, it's, it's, I

10:32.360 --> 10:34.360
don't know codes.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.360
I okay.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.360
No.

10:36.360 --> 10:40.200
What I think I was reading about what's supposed to happen is it's supposed to be that the

10:40.200 --> 10:47.920
X box would have a burner in it, that the drive functions is both a burner and a reader.

10:47.920 --> 10:52.560
And once you play the game for the first time, it would basically burn your console cereal

10:52.560 --> 10:54.340
into the disc.

10:54.340 --> 10:56.880
And at that point it would only work on that console.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.680
And I'm like, that has got to be the most hideous idea I've ever heard.

11:01.680 --> 11:06.320
Like really like, so I can't take a disc over to a friend's house anymore and play the game.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.200
I mean, that's how crazy we're getting.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.720
It's not going to happen.

11:11.720 --> 11:17.600
I just, just even the way that they say that that's how that's going to work is retarded.

11:17.600 --> 11:25.880
I mean, it's just, it's no, not even close to how it's going to work or they're not going

11:25.880 --> 11:26.880
to do that.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.880
Okay.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.560
First off, you know, you have companies like GameStop, basically if Microsoft were to do

11:31.560 --> 11:36.480
that on system, that would cut out the whole used business altogether, which is a good

11:36.480 --> 11:40.920
portion of where the revenue is for GameStop.

11:40.920 --> 11:47.280
I mean, who is by far the biggest company out there selling games to consumers.

11:47.280 --> 11:51.280
And it'd be also the same way if they decided, Hey, we're going to go digital only.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.460
Now granted with that, they could, you know, sell the little cards that they're doing now

11:54.460 --> 11:56.660
and that's fine.

11:56.660 --> 12:01.300
But I mean, there's no, there's not a lot of money to be made in new games.

12:01.300 --> 12:06.640
It's all used sales is where they're making their money and yeah, they could probably,

12:06.640 --> 12:11.880
you know, for some sort of kickbacks from, you know, these, um, hardware manufacturers,

12:11.880 --> 12:13.280
but it's not going to happen.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.040
It's just not, no one's going to buy into that.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.640
They're going to be like, fuck that bullshit.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.240
I'm going to buy a PlayStation or a Wii U.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.400
We definitely see game companies are already trying to kind of cut at the knees a little

12:24.400 --> 12:25.600
bit of the used game market.

12:25.600 --> 12:30.200
We see the online passes, but I see a big push towards digital distribution.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.360
Like isn't the VEDA supposed to have the games are cheaper now to download than they are.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.000
But they haven't released any of those yet.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
So we don't know.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.280
I mean, Japan, I mean it may be a little bit cheaper, but even still though, it's just

12:43.280 --> 12:48.520
that stuff is kind of to entice you to buy new, not forcing you to buy new.

12:48.520 --> 12:54.000
And I mean, they're not going to do anything like that anyways to tie it to one system

12:54.000 --> 12:59.880
because come on, what company had a huge failure rate with their launch systems?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.280
Who's really going to risk that bullshit?

13:01.280 --> 13:05.120
Oh, I bought 20 games, but now they're all fucking useless because my system died.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.120
I don't think so.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.980
They're not going to do that.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.560
It would be so ridiculous to even try to do that.

13:10.560 --> 13:17.640
And let's just say that, I mean, that would be easy to break for hackers to break, oh,

13:17.640 --> 13:18.840
let's make it burn stuff.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.400
Oh, we'll just break the burner out of it.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.400
It's not going to happen.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.320
And fuck, they're not going to make a console with a goddamn burner that can actually read

13:26.320 --> 13:27.320
those disks.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.040
That's just like piracy right there.

13:29.040 --> 13:32.080
Like, oh, no, one's going to hack that to burn games.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.760
Oh no, not at all.

13:33.760 --> 13:34.760
Of course.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.640
Now, granted, I think that was only one theory about how it's all supposed to work.

13:38.640 --> 13:43.240
I mean, that theory is so like vague and just like, well, here's how I think.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.240
It doesn't make any sense.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.020
They're just making assumptions.

13:46.020 --> 13:47.720
There's no data to support that.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.720
Yes.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.180
Will they continue on this trend where they're going to have, you know, some sort of code

13:52.180 --> 13:55.520
that you put in to give you some extra something or other?

13:55.520 --> 13:56.520
Yeah, maybe.

13:56.520 --> 14:00.040
Are they going to maybe do something where it's going to tie it to your console as far

14:00.040 --> 14:02.600
as like your game saves or something?

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
Maybe.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
I don't know.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.600
But I think Microsoft's a little bit more lax with that at least.

14:07.600 --> 14:12.360
You're tying them to at least your profile, but even that you can get around.

14:12.360 --> 14:17.460
I just don't think anyone's going to do anything that ballsy right now as far as making it

14:17.460 --> 14:19.800
where the used games will just not play in the system.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.660
Because I'm telling you, if one does that and the other ones don't, that's a big disadvantage

14:24.660 --> 14:25.660
for them.

14:25.660 --> 14:31.280
Because GameStop will just say, fuck you guys, I'm not going to support your system as much.

14:31.280 --> 14:36.200
Well, you know what, Microsoft's in an interesting situation as well with the whole online pass

14:36.200 --> 14:41.320
is that I don't think Microsoft can still justify the online pass for their first party

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
games.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.440
And if they do it, there's going to be a lot of crap that they're going to start getting.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.920
Because notice they're the one company that kind of hasn't been able to do it yet because

14:47.920 --> 14:50.740
they're charging for Xbox Live.

14:50.740 --> 14:54.360
So I mean, literally they're going to start double dipping for online passes.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.060
See here's the thing though, theirs is a little bit different.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.740
It's the same, it's same but different I guess.

15:00.740 --> 15:07.160
They have content that comes with the launch, I guess the launch pressing or whatever, the

15:07.160 --> 15:08.820
first pressing of a game.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.020
They have extra content that comes with it.

15:11.020 --> 15:17.360
Now the thing is, so is they're not fucking putting out there saying, hey, this is our

15:17.360 --> 15:19.040
online pass.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.600
It's just, it's download content.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.480
Like for example, I think with Alan Wake you got an episode or something for, it's like

15:24.480 --> 15:26.600
the first piece of download content for free.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.600
And that's cool that they're putting something in there for you to entice you to buy new.

15:31.600 --> 15:37.440
And that's all they have to do to spin it with EA instead of saying, this is an online

15:37.440 --> 15:38.440
pass.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.440
They say, hey, guess what?

15:39.440 --> 15:44.160
The launch, the first launch pressing of this game is going to get some extra download content

15:44.160 --> 15:45.160
with it.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.840
Oh my God, you don't even have to fucking call it an online pass.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.560
Why did you call it an online pass?

15:49.560 --> 15:53.720
There's such a negative connotation with that and you're just going to go and cut yourself

15:53.720 --> 15:57.880
at the niche just because this is what you've done with the other games?

15:57.880 --> 16:02.200
Just say, hey, look, it's a bonus DLC that we're putting out for those people that buy

16:02.200 --> 16:03.200
new.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.680
If you buy it used, you can still enjoy the wonderful game, but you're going to have to

16:05.680 --> 16:06.680
buy the DLC.

16:06.680 --> 16:11.160
I mean, that's not, that's not that bad and people can kind of expect that.

16:11.160 --> 16:15.920
Why should I get fucking free DLC if I didn't buy the game new?

16:15.920 --> 16:21.080
It's just how they're free, they really were dumb how they phrase it.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.040
Going to our chat, I'm a chat that orange on a trader.com Amiga 777 says, unless the

16:25.040 --> 16:28.300
next Xbox is download only, then that could be a problem.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.680
It's not going to fucking happen.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.800
Well, let me, let me say something for a minute.

16:31.800 --> 16:38.040
You can't be download only because we all have those caps on the, like the Comcast service

16:38.040 --> 16:40.160
and stuff is still 250 gig cap.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.400
One Xbox 360 game.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.580
If it's a big one, I mean, some of them don't really fill up the disc.

16:43.580 --> 16:45.400
They're like maybe 900 megs.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.560
Some of them though, like, you know, are probably what a good four or five gigabytes Blu-rays

16:49.560 --> 16:51.520
especially on average six gigs.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.520
Yeah.

16:52.520 --> 16:56.240
So I mean, you can only download so many of those and if you're streaming more movies,

16:56.240 --> 16:59.580
something's going to give everybody wants a piece of this.

16:59.580 --> 17:04.680
Now Xbox wants to charge me to, you know, download the game cause I can't buy it used

17:04.680 --> 17:05.680
anymore.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.000
But yet Comcast wants to charge me for using the bandwidth to download the game.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.760
I mean the consumers are going to reject this at some point.

17:11.760 --> 17:12.860
They're going to say it's not worth it.

17:12.860 --> 17:15.840
Go back to playing the old system.

17:15.840 --> 17:22.220
Some people will buy digital downloads and they have that out there right now.

17:22.220 --> 17:25.800
There's nothing wrong with offering things in multiple ways.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.600
Whether you want to buy a new disc, you want to buy a used disc, you want to buy a digital

17:28.600 --> 17:32.860
copy, you want to rent, whatever.

17:32.860 --> 17:35.800
There's nothing wrong with that.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.800
Giving people options.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.920
But when you start forcing people to download only, then people aren't going to buy your

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
system.

17:41.920 --> 17:42.920
Hello?

17:42.920 --> 17:43.920
PSP Go.

17:43.920 --> 17:44.920
Yeah, I know.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.280
I think the PSP Go is a great example of that.

17:47.280 --> 17:52.920
I know people that own a PSP Go that actually really like the system from a hardware perspective

17:52.920 --> 17:53.920
and all of that.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.280
So it really sounds like what happened with the PSP Go was kind of a tragedy because their

17:57.280 --> 18:01.880
whole implementing the digital download thing kind of got rejected by the user base as a

18:01.880 --> 18:08.080
whole and only, you know, definitely people that were more into like hardware and, you

18:08.080 --> 18:11.920
know, the game, gamophobes or whatever you want to call them, gamophiles, weren't really

18:11.920 --> 18:12.920
into the system.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.480
Otherwise, it was really rejected by people.

18:14.480 --> 18:22.080
And I think if the game makers kind of go down that path of making these systems that

18:22.080 --> 18:27.560
are going to be really complicated and expensive for the end user, I think they are going to

18:27.560 --> 18:32.960
make a hideous mistake that most people, probably not the type of people who listen to this

18:32.960 --> 18:35.760
show, although I would say a good portion that, you know, listen to show or are gaming

18:35.760 --> 18:39.960
enthusiasts and do podcasts, but most people, as in the people that carry the Nintendo Wii

18:39.960 --> 18:45.760
to number one, are not going to feel like they need a new console.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.760
They're not going to feel like they need to upgrade to this console because it sounds

18:48.760 --> 18:49.760
like, like what?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.200
You're going to charge me all this?

18:51.200 --> 18:52.760
This sounds like a Divix machine.

18:52.760 --> 18:53.760
Okay.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.760
First off, most of those people are going to know what a Divix machine is.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.160
You know what I mean, right?

18:58.160 --> 19:00.800
Second, the people aren't going to be comfortable.

19:00.800 --> 19:06.360
You know, your average consumer, sadly, is not comfortable with understanding how digital

19:06.360 --> 19:07.880
downloads work and stuff.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.760
They don't understand how that is.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.800
And that's why they like WiiWare's taken off really for Nintendo as far as like, I think

19:14.800 --> 19:21.040
more of the hardcore crowd because no one's, I mean, if they offered it in a way they presented

19:21.040 --> 19:24.720
it like Wii Sports Resort had DLC or something like that, well, of course, you know, none

19:24.720 --> 19:27.000
of the Nintendo games had DLC.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.360
If they had DLC for like Wii Sports Resort, maybe they would have sold some stuff.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.520
But I think most people aren't comfortable with that.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.580
I mean, hell, with those wireless systems, I'd be willing to bet most people didn't know

19:38.580 --> 19:45.280
how to hook it up to their internet, let alone be able to have the equipment to hook it up

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
to their internet.

19:46.280 --> 19:50.080
Because a lot of people don't have wifi in their house.

19:50.080 --> 19:55.520
Bochi Kawa in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, I saw a PSP go for sale at Kmart last

19:55.520 --> 19:58.200
week and I said, huh, didn't know they still made those.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.560
Oh, wait, those are probably just never taken off the shelf.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.680
Dude, you're at Kmart.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.380
I was at Kmart.

20:06.380 --> 20:07.380
What did you find?

20:07.380 --> 20:08.380
Dust bunnies?

20:08.380 --> 20:09.760
No, I bought cat litter there.

20:09.760 --> 20:10.760
Okay.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
Because cat litter doesn't go bad.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.080
It doesn't matter if it's five years old.

20:13.080 --> 20:17.040
Do they still have the doors that have the pressure sensors that you step on to open

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
them up?

20:18.040 --> 20:21.400
That's always fascinating.

20:21.400 --> 20:25.920
Really I couldn't tell because they were very squishy anyway.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.480
Do they still have the icy machines?

20:27.480 --> 20:29.280
No, it didn't have an icy machine.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.520
Everybody has icy machines now.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.520
This is what I remember.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.780
I did however go to the opening of a 7-Eleven and they gave up free Slurpees.

20:36.780 --> 20:37.780
Good times.

20:37.780 --> 20:41.320
All right, going to the chat room from other comments on Loki's rants and this whole story.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.800
Spazinator PC says, download only is risky.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.560
Look at what I went through with Sony and my videos kind of referencing how he's, you

20:48.560 --> 20:52.480
know, his PlayStations will break or he'll lose the license to his videos and he's had

20:52.480 --> 20:53.480
this huge collection.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.200
It's just a big pain in the butt.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.180
Uni in our chat room says, I rather want a physical copy of the game.

20:58.180 --> 21:00.040
It's all about the gratification.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.160
And I agree with that too.

21:01.160 --> 21:06.440
There is, you know, what happens to game collectors if things go digital only?

21:06.440 --> 21:10.780
Like Dark Soccer, I imagine that's got to piss you off to no end because you're so,

21:10.780 --> 21:14.360
you and Dan are so into like collecting that if everything goes digital, it's like, great.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.160
What do I have to show for it?

21:16.160 --> 21:17.160
Bits and bytes.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.160
Great.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.160
Good job.

21:19.160 --> 21:29.440
Because that there goes, you know, the need for your manuals for production material is

21:29.440 --> 21:30.440
pissing me off.

21:30.440 --> 21:34.440
Well, let me put it this way, a lot of this stuff I think already is digital as far as

21:34.440 --> 21:40.020
like, you know, Xbox Live Arcade, Xbox Indie Games, PlayStation Network, all that stuff.

21:40.020 --> 21:42.240
There's a lot of digital content out there already.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.040
I think if you're going to see anything in the new consoles, it's probably going to be

21:45.040 --> 21:50.140
some sort of actual cloud streaming as well where you may have the option to stream your

21:50.140 --> 21:51.140
game or whatever.

21:51.140 --> 21:56.000
Instead of a demo, you get a time, you know, demo of the actual full game and get to play

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
that.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.320
You mean what they're doing now on PlayStation Plus?

21:59.320 --> 22:00.320
Sort of.

22:00.320 --> 22:06.360
Or you can actually, you know, have games on demand almost like where you actually rent

22:06.360 --> 22:09.360
them and play them that way.

22:09.360 --> 22:15.920
Because that way the publisher still gets a, you know, kick out of that or kick back

22:15.920 --> 22:20.400
and you know, it's all trackable and it's win-win.

22:20.400 --> 22:24.560
Gamers get to try a game and the publishers get paid.

22:24.560 --> 22:28.640
All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks or we'll be here all night.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.400
So we're going to go around and talk about what video games we have been playing this

22:31.400 --> 22:34.120
week and our impressions thereof.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.640
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.320
Stupid computer just froze again.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.320
No.

22:38.320 --> 22:43.040
It does this thing where the cursor will freeze and it's seriously pissing me off.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.040
Okay.

22:44.040 --> 22:49.320
Um, I played, I actually got Bubble Bobble for iPhone, not Bubble Bobble, Puzzle Bobble.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.320
Best move.

22:50.320 --> 22:55.200
I've been playing the crap out of it because if there's a puzzle game that I think I love

22:55.200 --> 22:58.800
almost as much as P.O.P.O., it's Puzzle Bobble.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.000
How does that work with the iOS Touch?

23:00.000 --> 23:03.040
Do you just kind of touch on the grid where you want the bubble to fly or do you still

23:03.040 --> 23:04.040
have to kind of drag?

23:04.040 --> 23:05.040
You drag your finger across.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.040
Okay.

23:06.040 --> 23:11.600
It kind of sucks though if you've accidentally tapped it and then, oh shoot, I sent the bubble

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
out.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
But so far it's not like super hard.

23:13.600 --> 23:21.520
I've gotten like a gold star on every level but one and I've beaten the first two areas.

23:21.520 --> 23:27.880
So um, I've played that, I've played WoW.

23:27.880 --> 23:31.760
I really haven't done a lot of playing of much of anything else though just because

23:31.760 --> 23:33.160
I've been hurting.

23:33.160 --> 23:38.520
So I was going to start Skyrim but I'd really rather play it on PC.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.000
You should go check out how Alan's modded his all out.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.080
He's made the inventory screens like usable.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.080
It's pretty awesome.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
Cool.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.360
That's one of the nice things about having it on PC I think.

23:46.360 --> 23:50.200
But I'm still loyal to my P.A.S. 3 because I like to sit my big butt on the couch and

23:50.200 --> 23:51.200
have my controller.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.040
And Dan's lusting out for the new Borderlands.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.040
Oh yeah, yeah.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.040
Yeah.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.040
Soon.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.040
Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?

23:58.040 --> 24:01.480
Um, well since it's been a few weeks, I've played quite a bit actually.

24:01.480 --> 24:06.560
Of course, you know, there's new DLC for Saints Row the Third.

24:06.560 --> 24:13.720
I mean, I kind of knew what it was going to be getting in, you know, just looking at it.

24:13.720 --> 24:18.040
Basically the new Saints Row the Third DLC is Game Evil 7.

24:18.040 --> 24:23.720
It's a bunch of side missions or activities if you will that you get to play on it.

24:23.720 --> 24:28.160
And most of them are just kind of redressed activities from the regular game.

24:28.160 --> 24:33.400
Like they have an escort mission where it's you're escorting Genki and then you run people

24:33.400 --> 24:38.360
over with your car and that charges up a flamethrower that you torch people with.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.360
It's very boring.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.720
But, you know, and I've finished those.

24:41.720 --> 24:50.480
And then of course there's also the one that's the sad panda one.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.480
I can't remember.

24:51.480 --> 24:55.480
It's some kitten thing where you're rolling around a giant ball and it looks like, oh,

24:55.480 --> 24:56.480
Katamari.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.560
No, it's actually, it handles like a car.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.200
It even has like the sounds of a car.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.400
It's basically a car.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.640
So you're running stuff over and it's just a mayhem mission like they have in the regular

25:05.640 --> 25:07.840
game.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.640
So that was neat, I guess.

25:09.640 --> 25:18.160
And then of course there was another one that was basically just the regular Professor Genki,

25:18.160 --> 25:21.820
just his normal running through a maze and killing mascots and stuff.

25:21.820 --> 25:25.640
And then the one that was actually really weird that I thought was the most enjoyable

25:25.640 --> 25:29.840
out of all of them, because it is actually unique, was where you're skydiving as a panda

25:29.840 --> 25:35.280
through rings, landing on roofs and then chainsawing mascots and then skydiving down some more,

25:35.280 --> 25:37.080
bouncing off of balloons and stuff like that.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.400
It's really ridiculous.

25:38.400 --> 25:42.600
But that was kind of fun because it was somewhat unique.

25:42.600 --> 25:48.600
The only thing that's terrible about this is I finished the whole DLC portion in about

25:48.600 --> 25:50.920
45 minutes.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.480
Maybe less than 45 minutes.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.100
I didn't get all the achievements.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.520
I got about 80% of them.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.960
But that's sad.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.960
$7 for 45 minutes of entertainment.

26:00.960 --> 26:06.200
I mean, really they could have added a lot more content to it, but they only put two

26:06.200 --> 26:09.480
different levels of each activity that they added.

26:09.480 --> 26:14.680
I mean, they could have added a ton more activities or at least more versions of it that are difficult,

26:14.680 --> 26:15.880
more increasingly difficult.

26:15.880 --> 26:22.800
But no, they took the easy way out and just pretty much put out the, I don't know, the

26:22.800 --> 26:28.620
most minimal version of DLC as possible, which is very disappointing.

26:28.620 --> 26:33.400
So I'm kind of hesitant on whether I'm going to be buying some more of the other DLC that's

26:33.400 --> 26:34.520
going to be coming out.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.520
Probably because I do like Saints Row the Third and actually did go back and play some

26:37.520 --> 26:44.500
of the car theft missions that I had problems with it glitching out.

26:44.500 --> 26:49.200
And so I got some of those done, which is cool because I'm trying to get all the achievements

26:49.200 --> 26:50.920
for that.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.400
And then what else?

26:52.400 --> 26:57.680
Oh, I played, I downloaded some indie games, I actually played one of them, which is DLC

26:57.680 --> 26:58.680
Quest.

26:58.680 --> 27:01.240
Oh yeah, I remember that one.

27:01.240 --> 27:06.080
DLC Quest, it's kind of funny, it's more of like, it's something that would be a free

27:06.080 --> 27:07.080
Flash game.

27:07.080 --> 27:12.720
I mean, it's a cute little concept, but the game's over in less than an hour, but it's

27:12.720 --> 27:15.460
a buck, so it's not that bad.

27:15.460 --> 27:19.360
Better than paying $7 for 45 minutes.

27:19.360 --> 27:23.000
So it was alright, I mean, I'd recommend if you want to check it out, but that's kind

27:23.000 --> 27:27.840
of the problem with indie games, there's a lot of cool concepts on there, but when you

27:27.840 --> 27:30.080
go and play them, they're really short.

27:30.080 --> 27:35.600
It's kind of disappointing that it's not a full-fledged game.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.440
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

27:38.440 --> 27:40.000
Oh, of course, tons of Skyrim.

27:40.000 --> 27:47.400
I'm already, god, I don't even know, probably 120 hours into the game already.

27:47.400 --> 27:56.160
Level 54, although once I glitch out the Ogma and Finium, that'll be level 81 soon enough.

27:56.160 --> 28:00.480
And let's see, what else, did I do anything fun in Skyrim?

28:00.480 --> 28:05.240
I don't know, the game's getting more glitchy, as I mentioned before, I'm having texture

28:05.240 --> 28:09.960
problems now where it's not drawing the proper textures on things, and all sorts of weird

28:09.960 --> 28:10.960
stuff happening.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.300
But there's a new patch coming in really soon for Skyrim, right?

28:13.300 --> 28:14.920
I don't think it's gonna fix it.

28:14.920 --> 28:18.800
Every patch makes things worse, okay, I'm telling you.

28:18.800 --> 28:23.680
So we'll see, at least that patch, though, at the very least, that is gonna fix the Blood

28:23.680 --> 28:28.200
on Ice mission, the one that's all fucked up for me right now.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.400
So I'm glad that's gonna be fixed soon.

28:30.400 --> 28:35.600
And then, of course, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, I'm playing lots of that, and kicking

28:35.600 --> 28:36.600
ass.

28:36.600 --> 28:37.600
Nice.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.720
Alright, quickly, my gaming week, because there really hasn't been a whole lot I've

28:40.720 --> 28:43.880
been playing this week outside of WoW, there's not a lot of World of Warcraft this week.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.640
Okay, you know what, that's what I've been into.

28:46.640 --> 28:50.720
There's not a lot of old games I've really gone back to visit, although we did manage

28:50.720 --> 28:55.980
to get a copy of Toy Story Midway Mania on the Wii, because, you know, I love Disneyland,

28:55.980 --> 28:59.780
I love the rides and all that stuff, so Midway Mania's one of my favorite rides.

28:59.780 --> 29:03.040
So I was like, what the heck, let's just, you know, let's just check this out and see

29:03.040 --> 29:04.040
what it's like.

29:04.040 --> 29:09.420
And it's, okay, yeah, they try to emulate the ride by, basically you point the Wii mode

29:09.420 --> 29:14.640
at the screen, you hit A, and try to hit the targets, but, as you can imagine, it's pretty

29:14.640 --> 29:15.640
basic.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.240
Did you play it in 3D?

29:17.240 --> 29:20.880
No, I heard you could, but- It's supposed to come with glasses.

29:20.880 --> 29:27.600
No, I had a used one, so maybe they didn't have it, yeah, so, so, I don't know.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.200
I guess I'll have to, what are they, are they the red-blue, or are they the polarized ones?

29:30.200 --> 29:32.480
I don't know, I think it's red-blue.

29:32.480 --> 29:36.680
I wonder if it's kind of like the ride, which uses the polarized ones, I don't know.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.680
No, it's not that fancy.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.040
Maybe if I steal a copy from the ride, maybe it'll work at home?

29:40.040 --> 29:44.200
No, they don't have, you don't have a TV that supports polarized glasses.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.320
It's just, it's either red-blue or the cyan-purple, so.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.320
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.720
Or a cyan-green.

29:48.720 --> 29:53.920
It's probably, you know, it's not gonna really change my opinion on the game.

29:53.920 --> 29:58.080
They've tried to do some cute stuff with, like, you know, collecting stickers, and,

29:58.080 --> 30:03.480
you know, all the levels are not quite the same that they are in the ride itself.

30:03.480 --> 30:07.200
You feel a lot of influence from achievements and that whole thing.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.640
You know, you gotta score so many points on a stage.

30:09.640 --> 30:13.300
But everything's relatively easy, but you have to remember, it is, it's a Disney game.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.940
It's more geared towards kids.

30:14.940 --> 30:19.120
I bet it would be kind of fun to bring out at a party, especially with my friends that

30:19.120 --> 30:20.120
love Disneyland.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.880
Like, let's say Dark Sakura, myself, and maybe a couple of our other Disney-loving friends

30:23.880 --> 30:25.420
got together and did some drinking.

30:25.420 --> 30:27.680
This game might be fun.

30:27.680 --> 30:29.240
Anything's fun with drinking.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.240
Exactly!

30:30.240 --> 30:31.240
Otherwise...

30:31.240 --> 30:32.560
No, a game would be fun with drinking.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.560
What?

30:33.560 --> 30:35.280
Is the Kinect Disneyland adventures, I think, would be fun.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.800
I totally want that game still.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.960
I've heard it's pretty good.

30:37.960 --> 30:40.080
I don't have it myself, but I have some friends that have it.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.520
It's surprisingly not as bad as you'd think.

30:41.520 --> 30:46.440
There's also that other one, though, they're doing, was it the Pixar, was it, uh, Kinect

30:46.440 --> 30:49.080
Rush, Disney Pixar adventure?

30:49.080 --> 30:50.360
I hadn't heard of that, no.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.360
It's coming out in March.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.360
Oh.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.000
I wonder if that, is that similar to the Disneyland adventures?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Because it's just...

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Sort of.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
California adventures, maybe?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I don't know.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
No, it's all Pixar movies.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
No.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.880
But they have, like, the Incredibles and stuff in there, and Ratatouille, and...

31:04.880 --> 31:05.880
Yeah.

31:05.880 --> 31:09.000
And you wanna see Wall-E's in there, too, which is kinda cool.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Very cool.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.760
Alright, well, but, otherwise, that's really the only new game I've been playing this week.

31:12.760 --> 31:17.200
Keep in mind, next week, I have Coming to My House Tuesday, Final Fantasy XIII-2, and

31:17.200 --> 31:18.200
Soulcalibur V.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.240
So, it's gonna be a busy week next week.

31:20.240 --> 31:23.960
I haven't finished XIII, so, you know what, I'm holding off on it, and...

31:23.960 --> 31:27.760
Just, I, you know what, I never completely finished it either, but I'm not gonna, I,

31:27.760 --> 31:31.400
I, I'm worried that's gonna stop a lot of people from playing it, but, you know what,

31:31.400 --> 31:33.120
there's, just go watch the spoiler video online.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.160
I already know what the spoiler is, but I still wanna finish the game.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.160
Yeah.

31:37.160 --> 31:41.720
Well, Soulcalibur V is coming out this week, and, um, believe it or not, we know somebody

31:41.720 --> 31:46.480
who's been able to get their hands on it already, and we're gonna call him right now, and he's

31:46.480 --> 31:50.960
gonna come on and talk to us a little bit about Soulcalibur V!

31:50.960 --> 31:56.080
And it's my buddy from the one and only, Hoard House!

31:56.080 --> 31:58.040
Xtaphir should hopefully be on the line.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.040
Hello!

31:59.040 --> 32:00.040
Hello!

32:00.040 --> 32:02.040
Is this Xtaphir?

32:02.040 --> 32:03.040
This is Xtaphir.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.040
Hey, Xtaphir!

32:04.040 --> 32:05.040
How are you?

32:05.040 --> 32:06.040
Good!

32:06.040 --> 32:08.800
I'm so glad we finally have an excuse to get you on Orange Lawn's radio, cause usually

32:08.800 --> 32:11.320
it's, it's only ever Hoard House.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.520
I know!

32:12.520 --> 32:17.560
But you have been able to play Soulcalibur V, right?

32:17.560 --> 32:18.560
This is true.

32:18.560 --> 32:22.560
Alright, now, I don't know how you did that, but I'm not gonna ask questions, but, okay,

32:22.560 --> 32:28.440
so you had to play Soulcalibur V, so, first off, now, I think our listeners have to remember,

32:28.440 --> 32:31.160
you, you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?

32:31.160 --> 32:34.920
You play a lot of WoW, but you don't play a whole, whole lot of games, right?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.080
Um, not, not usually.

32:37.080 --> 32:45.560
I, I got a PS3 last year, and I, um, you know, I, I played through Uncharted 2, and I have

32:45.560 --> 32:50.600
a few fighting games, like, well, a couple fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street

32:50.600 --> 32:57.560
Fighter IV, so, uh, you know, I, I've been, I've been getting, uh, you know, down with

32:57.560 --> 32:59.280
console games lately, you know?

32:59.280 --> 33:00.280
You getting jiggy with it?

33:00.280 --> 33:01.760
And jiggy with the consoles?

33:01.760 --> 33:02.760
Yeah.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.640
I, I guess.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.320
Have you ever played a Soulcalibur game in your life?

33:07.320 --> 33:08.320
Yes.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.320
Okay.

33:09.320 --> 33:15.400
I played, I, well, I actually played the original Soul Blade, which I guess was Soul Edge in

33:15.400 --> 33:23.720
Japan, and, uh, and so I, I do, I did, uh, play that when it came out on the PlayStation,

33:23.720 --> 33:30.520
um, you know, years and years and years ago, and then, um, I played Soulcalibur 2 when

33:30.520 --> 33:36.200
I actually lived with you, um, because I remember you got the Weaver, or it was the GameCube

33:36.200 --> 33:42.200
version with Link in it, and so I do remember playing that, but that was the last time I

33:42.200 --> 33:48.800
ever played Soulcalibur, any kind of Soulcalibur game was, uh, you know, your copy of Soulcalibur

33:48.800 --> 33:49.800
2.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.600
Well, you know what you're saying isn't different from a lot of people.

33:51.600 --> 33:56.560
A lot of people missed Soulcalibur 3 because it was kind of late in the PlayStation 2 lifespan,

33:56.560 --> 34:00.880
and if I remember right, it was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so it never came out to the other

34:00.880 --> 34:01.880
consoles.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.760
Then Soulcalibur 4, some people saw Darth Vader and Yoda on the box and were like, no

34:05.760 --> 34:06.760
thank you.

34:06.760 --> 34:10.480
Although, I think, I think Soulcalibur 4 wasn't bad.

34:10.480 --> 34:14.960
I like all the Soulcalibur games, but, alright, so here we are, Soulcalibur 5, so tell us

34:14.960 --> 34:16.920
a little bit about the game.

34:16.920 --> 34:28.880
Yeah, I was lucky enough to get a collector's edition, and I was, you know, didn't really

34:28.880 --> 34:36.200
know what to expect, so I started playing with the story mode, which, I don't know what

34:36.200 --> 34:40.960
it is about fighting games and story modes, but they're all lame.

34:40.960 --> 34:45.160
They all, like, I think that the story mode is kind of cheap.

34:45.160 --> 34:53.080
All of the cutscenes are like little, you know, comic book pictures, and you just see

34:53.080 --> 34:59.400
little, you see little blurbs of what's going on, you know, and they do have voice acting

34:59.400 --> 35:00.900
accompanying it.

35:00.900 --> 35:04.120
But who plays fighting games for the stories?

35:04.120 --> 35:05.120
Who plays fighting games for the stories?

35:05.120 --> 35:09.160
And I'm going to get emails from angry fighting game fans.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.160
I do.

35:10.160 --> 35:15.200
But then again, Street Fighter 4 had a really cool story mode and had that little anime

35:15.200 --> 35:17.200
thing that went along with it, too.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.320
So it was actually really immersive, and I've always liked the Street Fighter stories.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.480
But Soulcalibur 5 gave you comic book and bad acting.

35:23.480 --> 35:31.240
Yeah, well, it wasn't that it was bad acting, it was just, it just felt kind of cheap.

35:31.240 --> 35:36.200
But they do have cutscenes, it's just the, well, animated cutscenes, they're kind of

35:36.200 --> 35:41.000
few and, you know, you blink and you miss them.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.620
But in terms of the fighting portion of the game, I love it.

35:46.620 --> 35:50.560
I think it's really cool.

35:50.560 --> 35:55.840
And the thing is, you know, of course, I'm used to Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2,

35:55.840 --> 35:59.000
you know, or Street Fighter 4.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.700
And so I was half thinking when I hit up, I'm going to jump.

36:04.700 --> 36:09.520
And so when I didn't, I'm like, Oh, God, like, this is 3D, right?

36:09.520 --> 36:11.440
Like I'm not I'm not used to that.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.400
I'm more used to the 2D fighting style.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.120
So it was kind of disorienting for me.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.680
But that's just a personal thing.

36:19.680 --> 36:25.640
But I really think the graphics and the way the fighting works and everything I kind of

36:25.640 --> 36:26.640
you kind of ease into it.

36:26.640 --> 36:30.880
And I think that Soulcalibur is kind of user friendly.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.320
When it comes to fighting.

36:32.320 --> 36:39.000
I think it's a really good game to be introduced to if you haven't ever done any 3D fighting

36:39.000 --> 36:40.640
games before.

36:40.640 --> 36:45.920
And I said, like, a tutorial or something was that was there a tutorial or something?

36:45.920 --> 36:53.160
No, there's no well, there is a training mode and they kind of hold your hand through combos

36:53.160 --> 36:54.520
and all that stuff.

36:54.520 --> 37:00.200
But it's just in terms of, I don't know, it just felt like really intuitive, like, you

37:00.200 --> 37:09.240
know, there's not much to every move that you you make feels like a special move because

37:09.240 --> 37:14.280
it all has flashy graphics and everything is just kind of it's aesthetically pleasing,

37:14.280 --> 37:16.240
I guess is what I'm trying to get at.

37:16.240 --> 37:20.200
Now I know I know you had a minute to play around with the create your own character

37:20.200 --> 37:24.040
mode, which has been a popular part of Soulcalibur since the third one.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.320
What did you think of create a character?

37:26.320 --> 37:28.680
Oh, I love it.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.080
I think it's, I think it's really good.

37:31.080 --> 37:35.440
I mean, they have a ton of options that you can do.

37:35.440 --> 37:41.280
I made a black chick chick and I named her Rob after you because you're a black chick.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.280
Thank you.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.280
Thank you.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.280
Yeah.

37:44.280 --> 37:45.280
I appreciate it.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.280
Yeah.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.760
And you can you can make her her special moves.

37:48.760 --> 37:55.480
Have like a little, you know, aura and you are, you know, and make that excuse me make

37:55.480 --> 37:59.760
that aura a color and I made it purple.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.760
Like Tinky Winky.

38:00.760 --> 38:01.760
I appreciate that.

38:01.760 --> 38:02.760
Oh, no problem.

38:02.760 --> 38:03.760
Whatever.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.280
I don't get that.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.800
But um, yeah, it's it's really cool.

38:08.800 --> 38:14.560
And then then I brought it over to my brother in laws and he was able to make a character

38:14.560 --> 38:22.240
that looks a lot like Cole from what's an infamous and and my sister made a character

38:22.240 --> 38:24.840
that I can't quite describe.

38:24.840 --> 38:34.840
She looks like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica, but with like, a monk's outfit on and like

38:34.840 --> 38:39.640
some kind of like really heavy looking.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.000
She has like heavy looking gauntlets on or something.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.040
It's like really weird.

38:43.040 --> 38:46.800
So that's something that a lot of people in Soul Calibur will do is they try to like copy

38:46.800 --> 38:50.400
characters from you know, popular culture and stuff best they can and they create a

38:50.400 --> 38:51.580
character mode.

38:51.580 --> 38:54.000
So yeah, and then fuck them up.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah, exactly.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.680
Because you can't ever get it perfect in Soul Calibur.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.140
So did you did you get to do any verses like were you playing against other people and

39:02.140 --> 39:03.140
you know,

39:03.140 --> 39:08.160
no, because the game isn't isn't really out yet.

39:08.160 --> 39:13.960
I tried to go online, but it said nobody's playing the game or whatever it like didn't

39:13.960 --> 39:16.240
let me connect to anybody.

39:16.240 --> 39:21.040
So I didn't really get to experience the online element to the game.

39:21.040 --> 39:25.480
But I'm sure that it has a nice user interface.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.520
So there's that.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.520
Okay.

39:28.520 --> 39:31.080
It has a nice interface.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.480
I appreciate that.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.480
Yeah.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.480
All right.

39:34.480 --> 39:38.120
So anything else that the OLR listeners should know about Soul Calibur five before it comes

39:38.120 --> 39:41.560
out this week?

39:41.560 --> 39:44.000
I think that it's it's a good game.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.560
I mean, if you like fighting games, and you like 3d fighting games in particular, like

39:48.560 --> 39:50.280
I don't think you'll be disappointed.

39:50.280 --> 39:55.840
I think that from what I hear, I read a few reviews on it.

39:55.840 --> 40:02.160
And they seem to think that it's improved from since Soul Calibur four, I guess there

40:02.160 --> 40:07.200
were some little buggy issues that they say that it's improved on.

40:07.200 --> 40:15.220
But they also kind of echo my my opinion that the story the single player story mode is

40:15.220 --> 40:18.880
kind of, you know, kind of cheap, but whatever, you know, it's a fighting game.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.280
You don't you don't play for the story, but no, you just want to wrestle.

40:22.280 --> 40:26.480
That's why we play fighting games, you know, sometimes you just want to wrestle.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
Exactly.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
You know.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.480
All right.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.480
Well, extra for I gotta let you go.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.480
So we get to some gaming news.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.320
But thank you for coming on and talking about Soul Calibur five.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.460
What would you give it on a scale of one to 10?

40:37.460 --> 40:40.920
I would give it Can I do point five?

40:40.920 --> 40:41.920
Sure.

40:41.920 --> 40:42.920
I'll do do 8.5.

40:42.920 --> 40:43.920
How about that?

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
Good.

40:44.920 --> 40:45.920
Good.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.760
Because we have to always have that arbitrary score for no particular reason.

40:47.760 --> 40:48.760
Yeah.

40:48.760 --> 40:53.680
So before we let you go, is there anything you want to plug?

40:53.680 --> 40:54.680
Somebody's but

40:54.680 --> 40:59.280
well, we hope this show will help you in accomplishing that.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.680
Oh, okay.

41:00.680 --> 41:01.680
I'm sure this show will.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
All right.

41:02.680 --> 41:03.680
Me that.

41:03.680 --> 41:04.680
All right.

41:04.680 --> 41:05.680
Bye extrovert.

41:05.680 --> 41:06.680
Okay.

41:06.680 --> 41:07.680
Bye.

41:07.680 --> 41:08.680
All right.

41:08.680 --> 41:14.520
The one and only expert from Hoard House www.hoardhouse.com World of Warcraft discussion,

41:14.520 --> 41:15.520
and so forth.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.520
All right.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.680
Let's get into some actual gaming news now.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.880
Oh, housekeeping real quick.

41:18.880 --> 41:23.120
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio or our Twitter, twitter.com slash

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
OLR.

41:24.120 --> 41:28.800
As far as our upcoming schedule of shows, we are scheduled to be here every week.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.080
Yes, we will be here next week.

41:30.080 --> 41:34.840
I know it's Super Bowl Sunday, but whatever.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.360
So our local team isn't even in it anyway.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.360
So whatever.

41:38.360 --> 41:43.680
Uh, and, uh, yeah, so we'll be here and throughout, I don't see any weeks off coming up.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.680
Do you have any, do you have any more cheesecake dates, star soccer that I need to be aware

41:46.680 --> 41:47.680
of?

41:47.680 --> 41:48.680
Huh?

41:48.680 --> 41:49.680
All right.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.600
Excuse me.

41:51.600 --> 41:56.160
Let's get into some, uh, gaming news then Loki.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.160
All right.

41:57.160 --> 42:06.920
Uh, let's start off with talking about some ridiculous rumors regarding the Xbox lube.

42:06.920 --> 42:15.640
And um, of course the rumor is that apparently the new system will launch on holiday 2013

42:15.640 --> 42:23.080
and it's going to launch with a new GPU that's going to be put out by, um, ATI or AMD I guess

42:23.080 --> 42:24.440
at this point.

42:24.440 --> 42:34.460
It's um, I guess part of the AMD 6,000 series, um, which is roughly about 20%, uh, more performance

42:34.460 --> 42:39.000
power than the Wii U, at least what the Wii U is specced at right now.

42:39.000 --> 42:45.960
And also, um, apparently it is, uh, quite a bit stronger than, uh, the Xbox 360 and

42:45.960 --> 42:46.960
PlayStation three.

42:46.960 --> 42:52.760
Obviously, I mean, why would you put out a system with a graphics card or a graphics

42:52.760 --> 42:59.600
chip that's not, I mean, put out the same stuff with more copy protection, two of them

42:59.600 --> 43:00.600
together.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.600
Call it a weed.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.600
No.

43:03.600 --> 43:10.200
So yeah, it's going to support DirectX or the Radeon, uh, HD, uh, 66, 70, which is what

43:10.200 --> 43:14.920
this chip is going to be sort of based on, uh, supports DirectX 11, which is going to

43:14.920 --> 43:15.920
look nice.

43:15.920 --> 43:21.080
A 10 ADP HD multi display output, 3d and a bunch of other fun stuff.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.680
I mean, and that's what it's assumed as right now, what they're going to be using.

43:24.680 --> 43:29.920
I guess they're already manufacturing the chips for it, so we'll see.

43:29.920 --> 43:35.760
I mean, it's all rumors, so we'll know until they officially announce it, which they could,

43:35.760 --> 43:37.900
they could announce the new systems coming.

43:37.900 --> 43:40.280
Do rumors like this really even matter?

43:40.280 --> 43:44.440
Because the whole, like the Xbox will be whatever it's called, will be more powerful.

43:44.440 --> 43:45.440
Duh.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.180
It's all potential.

43:47.180 --> 43:48.960
This just basically says potential.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.800
I mean, however they use that, it's hard to say.

43:51.800 --> 43:56.960
I mean, and even the chips that are in the Xbox 360 right now compared to today's standards

43:56.960 --> 43:59.000
are not powerful at all.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.760
But it's just how they use it.

44:00.760 --> 44:07.400
Um, so it's, it's, I mean, it's hard to say what it will look like.

44:07.400 --> 44:11.860
I'm sure it'll look nice, but also I think a lot of it has to do with when you put the

44:11.860 --> 44:15.560
specs out there, then your competition can see it and they know how to one up you.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.480
So one reason I would think that Microsoft may not want to put it out there this year

44:18.480 --> 44:22.300
is that they don't want Sony to know what's going in there because then Sony will just

44:22.300 --> 44:24.080
do whatever they have to do to one up it.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.360
I could still do that anyways.

44:26.360 --> 44:30.440
They put their system out longer, but the thing is it's not like, Oh, well we're going

44:30.440 --> 44:36.400
to use the AMD 7,000 instead they have a manufacturer fucking thousands of these chips or millions

44:36.400 --> 44:37.400
of these chips.

44:37.400 --> 44:44.040
You know, they're not going to just all of a sudden change their mind because IGN's reporting

44:44.040 --> 44:49.160
on something that it's a rumor inside source.

44:49.160 --> 44:55.440
They're going to put the most powerful GPU CPU that they can in the system and still

44:55.440 --> 44:57.300
make it cost effective for the consumer.

44:57.300 --> 44:58.300
That's what they're going to do.

44:58.300 --> 45:04.920
I mean, I mean, they're not going to, they're going to put an old, uh, the Intel, what's

45:04.920 --> 45:09.040
it like seller graphics card 500 or whatever.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.040
All right.

45:10.040 --> 45:13.120
Moving on to games that are going to be coming out a lot sooner than whatever the next X-Box

45:13.120 --> 45:14.120
is.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.120
Resident Evil Revelations.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.320
There was a couple of news stories going around about it this week.

45:17.320 --> 45:18.520
One, the demo is out.

45:18.520 --> 45:22.580
I didn't mention it during my gaming week cause I don't like to review demos, but I

45:22.580 --> 45:25.680
did download the demo for Resident Evil Revelations.

45:25.680 --> 45:29.040
I thought it was interesting because on the 3DS, when you download the demo, or at least

45:29.040 --> 45:34.880
this one, it says uses left 30, meaning I would get to play the demo 30 times.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.880
And then what?

45:35.880 --> 45:36.880
I don't know.

45:36.880 --> 45:37.880
Do I have to delete it and download it again?

45:37.880 --> 45:43.280
Or, or will my system like know that, Oh, I can't play any, I'm milking this demo for

45:43.280 --> 45:46.560
all it's worth having played through it 30 times.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.400
Has anyone ever played a demo 30 times?

45:48.400 --> 45:51.640
I'm trying to think if I've ever loved a demo that much.

45:51.640 --> 45:52.640
I have once.

45:52.640 --> 45:53.640
Yes.

45:53.640 --> 45:54.640
Really?

45:54.640 --> 45:55.640
Okay.

45:55.640 --> 45:56.640
What, what?

45:56.640 --> 45:57.640
Jumping Flash.

45:57.640 --> 45:58.640
Really?

45:58.640 --> 46:04.400
I played the demo of Jumping Flash for weeks, several times a day, cause it was so freaking

46:04.400 --> 46:06.800
fun and I couldn't afford the game at the time.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.200
Alan wants to comment.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.520
I played the Bayonetta demo at least two dozen times.

46:11.520 --> 46:12.960
The Bayonetta demo was pretty sweet.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.200
I'll give it that.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.200
Logie?

46:15.200 --> 46:16.840
The original Cool Borders demo.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.120
I played that tons of times.

46:19.120 --> 46:21.480
And the original Saints Row demo.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.880
It was a 30 minute demo and I played that over and over and over again.

46:24.880 --> 46:27.480
The Final Fantasy, uh, eight demo.

46:27.480 --> 46:31.200
I would say maybe the demo for Parappa the Rappa.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.200
Yes.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.040
I played that a bunch too.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.040
That's the only thing.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
And the Umjammerlami one.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.040
Oh.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.040
I played that a bunch too.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.040
Okay.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.040
Okay.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.840
Well anyway, look, I don't think Resident Evil Revelations is going to be one of those

46:42.840 --> 46:43.840
games.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.440
Maybe, I don't know, maybe for you it will be whatever.

46:45.440 --> 46:48.080
I played it and I was like, this is kind of neat.

46:48.080 --> 46:50.480
I like the 3d effects and it's, it's cool.

46:50.480 --> 46:55.240
It's, you know, it's, you know, got that scary Resident Evil S kind of like, like the older

46:55.240 --> 46:59.120
games had kind of feels a lot more like that, but I'm going to be honest.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.120
What do they want for this game?

47:00.120 --> 47:01.120
New?

47:01.120 --> 47:04.200
They wanted what, 50 bucks at one point and then they dropped it down to 40, right?

47:04.200 --> 47:05.200
Yes.

47:05.200 --> 47:09.640
And I don't think I, I don't personally, I'm not into the series enough where I can justify

47:09.640 --> 47:10.640
40 bucks.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.520
I know there are some people that will, and that's cool.

47:12.520 --> 47:16.320
I don't think they're going to be terribly disappointed, but, uh, just, you know, not

47:16.320 --> 47:17.920
so much for me.

47:17.920 --> 47:22.220
But those that are getting on this game early are going to get something that's a bit of

47:22.220 --> 47:23.480
a blessing and a curse.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.160
And there's a lot of lulls going around the internet about that this week.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.880
I mean, this is on the front page of Yahoo.

47:27.880 --> 47:34.040
I saw this is the fact that the Resident Evil Revelations box art is spelled wrong.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.880
That was only review copies on the side.

47:35.880 --> 47:39.880
It's only, well, they're saying it's the it's well, Capcom put out a statement.

47:39.880 --> 47:43.760
Uh, it has come to our attention that there was a misspelling on the Resident Evil Revelations

47:43.760 --> 47:44.760
packaging.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.480
We apologize for the mistake, which will be corrected for subsequent productions of the

47:48.480 --> 47:49.480
game.

47:49.480 --> 47:52.000
It makes it sound like the first printing cause it, the first printing has to already

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
be out there.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.720
It's, it's hitting shelves on the seventh, right?

47:54.720 --> 47:56.360
You're so funny with your print.

47:56.360 --> 48:02.320
Remember way back when Okami came out and the, we, and there was an IGN watermark on

48:02.320 --> 48:03.320
it.

48:03.320 --> 48:04.320
Oh yeah.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.320
Oh God.

48:05.320 --> 48:06.320
That was funny.

48:06.320 --> 48:10.280
They had to like recall them all or something or no, they had the substitute box art and

48:10.280 --> 48:11.280
you know what?

48:11.280 --> 48:13.520
I didn't even own the game and I got the substitute box art.

48:13.520 --> 48:16.180
Well, they're going to do something similar for this.

48:16.180 --> 48:20.760
They are saying that they might, uh, actually be, I guess they're going to work on a solution

48:20.760 --> 48:23.400
to provide affected customers with the correct packaging.

48:23.400 --> 48:29.760
But in my mind, I'm thinking the value of the misspelled ones just shot like way up.

48:29.760 --> 48:34.520
Nah, no, you don't think I beg to differ with Logie.

48:34.520 --> 48:40.620
Monopoly and I'm thinking like baseball cards that are spelled on or is it in reference

48:40.620 --> 48:41.620
to a game?

48:41.620 --> 48:42.620
Yeah.

48:42.620 --> 48:43.620
Uh huh.

48:43.620 --> 48:48.480
There was a release of Monopoly on the Sega master system that had it mono space pulley.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.720
But was that in the game or on the box art?

48:50.720 --> 48:53.120
On the box art, on the cartridge.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.680
Nice.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.040
And it's a collector's item.

48:57.040 --> 49:00.660
But here's the thing, and this is the only thing I can think of where I do somewhat agree

49:00.660 --> 49:01.660
with Logie.

49:01.660 --> 49:04.400
Like I agree with you with the classic stuff, but then Logie, I'm thinking that stuff is

49:04.400 --> 49:08.480
really easy to fake in this day and age with the types of color printers we have.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.280
You know, like how easy would that be?

49:10.280 --> 49:11.960
There's ways around it.

49:11.960 --> 49:18.840
There are ways to find if it's a fake because, okay, first of all, you'd be dealing with

49:18.840 --> 49:21.560
the pound of paper that they use.

49:21.560 --> 49:26.040
You would, uh, you would be dealing with their print resolutions.

49:26.040 --> 49:30.600
You would be dealing with, you can actually sometimes tell what type of printer was used

49:30.600 --> 49:35.640
for something just by looking with, there's a, with a, what's it called?

49:35.640 --> 49:39.280
A loop at the, um, the print itself.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.280
Yeah.

49:40.280 --> 49:45.360
And it says, I hear that eBay is lighting up with high prices for the misspelled ones.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.340
Be careful with something like eBay.

49:47.340 --> 49:53.280
Just, you know, remember, go back a few episodes, uh, slate or excuse me, Alan got me a birthday

49:53.280 --> 49:58.640
present game on eBay that ended up coming from China and it was the wrong damn game.

49:58.640 --> 50:03.240
He bought me, he bought me child of Eden and we ended up getting a copy of Assassin's Creed

50:03.240 --> 50:04.240
brotherhood.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.480
It was a bootleg of the wrong game.

50:05.480 --> 50:06.480
It was a bootleg of the wrong game.

50:06.480 --> 50:07.480
It was ridiculous.

50:07.480 --> 50:08.480
Just be careful with eBay.

50:08.480 --> 50:11.800
Not knocking eBay and get a lot of good stuff there, but be very careful with video games.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.800
Oh yeah.

50:12.800 --> 50:14.520
There are lots of people that will take advantage of you.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.520
That reminds me before I forget.

50:15.520 --> 50:19.800
I do have master system games to be sending out, um, probably in the next couple of weeks.

50:19.800 --> 50:20.800
Awesome.

50:20.800 --> 50:21.800
To winners.

50:21.800 --> 50:22.800
Good.

50:22.800 --> 50:23.800
Good deal.

50:23.800 --> 50:24.800
I haven't forgotten about you guys.

50:24.800 --> 50:25.800
And, uh, I did have a story here.

50:25.800 --> 50:30.320
We already mentioned it though because of the four gigabyte cartridge that resident evil

50:30.320 --> 50:33.680
revelations uses as opposed to the two gigabyte cartridge.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.800
They were trying to justify a $50 price tag.

50:36.800 --> 50:37.800
Well that didn't last.

50:37.800 --> 50:42.720
They did officially drop it to $40, but you may think about, well, if you want to play

50:42.720 --> 50:46.560
it with a circle pad pro, you're going to have to dump an extra $20 on it anyway.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.800
So it's really not that cheap.

50:47.800 --> 50:48.800
Well, cool.

50:48.800 --> 50:53.240
I saved myself 60 bucks.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.840
Which would you download it or something?

50:54.840 --> 50:58.400
No, I'm just not going to play it.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.400
Okay.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.400
Anyhow.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.320
All right, let's move on.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.320
Tark Sagra.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.840
Well, um, I never can pronounce the name of this company, right?

51:07.840 --> 51:09.840
Is it ASIS or ASIS or A-S-U-S?

51:09.840 --> 51:10.840
ASUS?

51:10.840 --> 51:11.840
A-S-U-S.

51:11.840 --> 51:12.840
Yeah.

51:12.840 --> 51:13.840
Like Loki's laptop.

51:13.840 --> 51:14.840
ASUS.

51:14.840 --> 51:15.840
ASUS.

51:15.840 --> 51:16.840
Um, but...

51:16.840 --> 51:18.840
I think most people say A-S-U-S.

51:18.840 --> 51:19.840
Yeah.

51:19.840 --> 51:28.120
At any rate, um, there is a, uh, note that there is a PC connect SKU, um, going to be

51:28.120 --> 51:31.760
coming out for an ASIS, uh, laptop.

51:31.760 --> 51:35.520
It's going to apparently have a built-in Kinect sensor.

51:35.520 --> 51:38.480
It's, uh, just licensed out by Microsoft.

51:38.480 --> 51:46.240
Um, they're not doing the, I guess, the creation of the item itself, but, um, Microsoft did

51:46.240 --> 51:51.800
confirm that the laptops are going to have Kinect's functionality built in.

51:51.800 --> 51:56.840
And of course, you know, we know the standalone PC Kinect is going to be out, um, on February

51:56.840 --> 51:58.600
1st for $249.

51:58.600 --> 51:59.600
I'm not surprised.

51:59.600 --> 52:02.200
They already, I think they already said that they're going to be trying to integrate that

52:02.200 --> 52:03.200
in the PCs.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.200
I mean, it makes sense.

52:04.200 --> 52:08.120
You're not going to have just a separate Kinect sensor that's going to be separate from the

52:08.120 --> 52:09.120
laptop.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.120
Of course it's going to be integrated.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.120
Makes sense.

52:11.120 --> 52:14.640
See, honestly, something like that would be great for me when too much typing, you know,

52:14.640 --> 52:17.120
starts to hurt after a while.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.120
You know, air type.

52:18.120 --> 52:21.240
That would just be pretty awesome.

52:21.240 --> 52:27.200
But I mean, I guess for a laptop, I don't know how it would make as much sense as having

52:27.200 --> 52:31.520
something like that for a PC because, you know, a lot of people do PC gaming and we

52:31.520 --> 52:35.080
have a PC hooked up to our TV in the front room.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.080
Something like that would be a good idea.

52:36.080 --> 52:39.200
I just don't see exactly how it would work for a laptop unless it's for like virtual

52:39.200 --> 52:42.440
keyboard and disabled services.

52:42.440 --> 52:43.440
So.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.080
All right.

52:45.080 --> 52:53.760
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, this is kind of funny, um, the Wii U getting

52:53.760 --> 52:57.400
a brand new, uh, network to go along with it, which is good.

52:57.400 --> 53:03.480
I mean, cause right now what they've got for, I don't even know if you really call it and

53:03.480 --> 53:08.620
there was a wifi connect or something like that, which I guess that's, that makes sense

53:08.620 --> 53:12.240
for like, you know, the Wii and the Nintendo wifi connection.

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
Yes.

53:13.240 --> 53:17.660
The Wii and the DS because those are all wifi, but I don't know if the Wii U is wifi.

53:17.660 --> 53:21.200
So that wouldn't make much sense if it was a wired connection.

53:21.200 --> 53:25.620
But um, the Wii U is getting this brand new thing called the Nintendo network and it's

53:25.620 --> 53:27.960
actually going to start with the 3DS.

53:27.960 --> 53:32.960
Um, this was kind of leaked out a little bit early with the new Final Fantasy theater was

53:32.960 --> 53:36.720
a the rhythm, um, cover actually the logo on there.

53:36.720 --> 53:41.820
And then of course, Nintendo, uh, was talking a little bit about it as part of an investor

53:41.820 --> 53:46.360
presentation and some of the things that are going to be coming with the Nintendo network

53:46.360 --> 53:49.240
communities of Mario Kart seven players.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.780
So they're going to have some sort of community feature with that already has communities

53:52.780 --> 53:53.780
in it.

53:53.780 --> 53:54.780
So are they expanding that?

53:54.780 --> 53:58.640
I guess that would be cool if there's like web integration or something like, you know,

53:58.640 --> 54:02.400
things that were in halo three like five years ago.

54:02.400 --> 54:06.840
Well they're saying, they're saying that community building functionality that, um, they've already

54:06.840 --> 54:08.560
implemented in Mario Kart seven.

54:08.560 --> 54:12.000
So I don't know if they're still expanding on that, but um, they're also doing an add

54:12.000 --> 54:17.280
on content sales and the fact that they don't have DLC yet.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.280
Come on.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.280
What do you do?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.280
Rockband has DLC.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.280
Yeah.

54:21.280 --> 54:25.120
For the Wii, but not like on the three D S and the DS and stuff like that.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.120
All right.

54:26.120 --> 54:27.120
Whatever.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.120
All right.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.120
Okay.

54:29.120 --> 54:31.800
Um, preparing for digital distribution of package software.

54:31.800 --> 54:35.920
So I mean, they're going to have some, you know, downloadable games, I guess.

54:35.920 --> 54:40.520
And the introduction of personal accounts for the Wii U, which in my opinion is the

54:40.520 --> 54:42.640
only actual new news in here.

54:42.640 --> 54:43.640
Yeah.

54:43.640 --> 54:44.640
Yeah.

54:44.640 --> 54:47.660
I mean, because yes, I understand that now Nintendo is saying they could sell full games

54:47.660 --> 54:50.800
online or whatever, but virtual console is full games.

54:50.800 --> 54:56.760
The three DS shots, bigger, full games are fantastic that you can sell full games online.

54:56.760 --> 54:59.920
Welcome to 10 years ago for everybody else.

54:59.920 --> 55:04.000
I mean, it's like, come on, where the fuck have you been Nintendo?

55:04.000 --> 55:08.560
But yay for them finally catching up because I would like to see a Nintendo console that

55:08.560 --> 55:10.400
understands online.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.880
So that'd be nice.

55:11.880 --> 55:19.880
Um, but uh, yeah, um, the fact that they are, um, you know, finally doing this whole personal

55:19.880 --> 55:22.600
accounts and maybe that means no more friend code.

55:22.600 --> 55:25.960
I hope we'll see.

55:25.960 --> 55:26.960
I would hope not.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.520
I don't like friend codes there.

55:29.520 --> 55:30.520
Who does?

55:30.520 --> 55:31.640
Does anyone like friend codes?

55:31.640 --> 55:34.040
I don't like friends.

55:34.040 --> 55:38.280
No, it was an overrated TV show.

55:38.280 --> 55:39.280
I agree.

55:39.280 --> 55:45.200
I really don't like that show, except I always liked when what's her face, his hair would

55:45.200 --> 55:49.000
frizz out because it totally reminded me of going back to Alabama.

55:49.000 --> 55:55.120
All right, so Nintendo network, when will we get like, I know we've had investor information,

55:55.120 --> 55:56.440
but when do we get the real information?

55:56.440 --> 55:59.040
Have they said anything about that or no?

55:59.040 --> 56:00.040
Nope.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.040
Soon.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.040
E3.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.040
Right?

56:03.040 --> 56:04.040
Probably.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.040
Hey, guess what guys?

56:05.040 --> 56:12.000
We have this little technology that we're in implements called patching our games.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Downloadable content.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.760
It's like getting the new game, but you're downloading extra pieces.

56:17.760 --> 56:22.040
Now I know this is totally revolutionary and you only have to pay a hundred Mario coins

56:22.040 --> 56:26.000
to unlock the online features.

56:26.000 --> 56:35.020
This thing that we're going to call the wifi pass, uh, you need to play the play as Luigi

56:35.020 --> 56:36.020
though.

56:36.020 --> 56:40.560
They should really, I think that the only two lazy to walk, do you need to buy extra

56:40.560 --> 56:41.560
play coins?

56:41.560 --> 56:46.220
You can unlock stationary and swap notes DLC that's going to have it.

56:46.220 --> 56:47.220
Watch it happen.

56:47.220 --> 56:54.080
DLC quest with the first DLC you buy is the ability to walk left and animations.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.080
And then I love it.

56:55.080 --> 57:01.420
The, uh, sexy outfit, um, DLC that you can get in DLC quests, add sexy outfits to everybody

57:01.420 --> 57:02.420
in the game.

57:02.420 --> 57:05.080
It's the bikinis all around fun.

57:05.080 --> 57:06.080
Good times.

57:06.080 --> 57:08.240
All right, well let's move on and talk about guy.

57:08.240 --> 57:12.520
Kai, you know, guy Kai is one of those online streaming networks, kind of like on live and

57:12.520 --> 57:13.520
so forth.

57:13.520 --> 57:18.880
Um, guy Kai is going to be doing a full game streaming services on the various gaming and

57:18.880 --> 57:23.480
entertainment websites that they, um, we'll be working with now.

57:23.480 --> 57:24.480
Right now.

57:24.480 --> 57:25.480
They only do demos.

57:25.480 --> 57:26.480
That's the difference right now.

57:26.480 --> 57:30.340
Guy Kai specializes in demos, but they are going to be doing full game streaming services.

57:30.340 --> 57:35.200
Now here's the thing, one of those partners involved is Facebook, which you know, if you

57:35.200 --> 57:37.240
might've heard of it, it's a pretty popular website.

57:37.240 --> 57:43.080
Um, also guy Kai is supposed to be doing stuff with YouTube, best buy Walmart, and even directly

57:43.080 --> 57:48.240
with the publishers, EA and Ubisoft full game streaming is supposed to go about 90 days

57:48.240 --> 57:52.180
after the Facebook version begins, which is going to be very soon.

57:52.180 --> 57:56.600
Guy Kai does compete with on live, but, um, the folks behind guy Kai, including the head,

57:56.600 --> 58:00.360
Dave Perry says that one of the big difference between the two companies is they have to

58:00.360 --> 58:01.680
modify the game.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.460
They have to get the source code to the game.

58:03.460 --> 58:06.280
Guy Kai does not require modification of the game.

58:06.280 --> 58:10.280
So throwing a little shade at the competition, they're saying, basically we can just stream

58:10.280 --> 58:11.280
the game.

58:11.280 --> 58:17.240
Um, guy Kai is not planned for consoles, uh, but they are, you know, saying, you know,

58:17.240 --> 58:19.560
this could work on consoles basically.

58:19.560 --> 58:24.800
So very interesting that that could be integrated with Facebook soon.

58:24.800 --> 58:28.640
Cause especially because Facebook games, you know, are still kind of a big thing.

58:28.640 --> 58:29.760
There's a lot that people play.

58:29.760 --> 58:32.740
I've, I've heard that a lot of them are dying.

58:32.740 --> 58:36.120
Like there's not nearly as many farmers in Farmville as there were some time ago, but

58:36.120 --> 58:42.200
I will admit as terrible as they are, I can't stop playing like the pressure luck.

58:42.200 --> 58:47.340
There's a new pressure luck game on Facebook and you get to actually spin the board and

58:47.340 --> 58:49.280
hit the button and go, no whammies, no whammies.

58:49.280 --> 58:52.740
You know, it's kind of, kind of fun cause you're playing against like real people.

58:52.740 --> 58:55.720
So I don't know, dark soccer is giving me that look like she's judging me and I don't

58:55.720 --> 58:56.720
like it.

58:56.720 --> 58:58.080
Are you judging me?

58:58.080 --> 58:59.080
Dark soccer.

58:59.080 --> 59:00.080
I'm judging you.

59:00.080 --> 59:02.240
Haven't you played Facebook games?

59:02.240 --> 59:03.240
There's gotta be a face.

59:03.240 --> 59:08.240
I quit a lot of my Facebook games, but you have in the past played that stupid final

59:08.240 --> 59:09.240
fantasy one.

59:09.240 --> 59:13.280
I was going to say there was the fun nights of the clicky nights of the clicky.

59:13.280 --> 59:15.280
And then I was like, what the fuck am I doing?

59:15.280 --> 59:16.280
Oh yeah.

59:16.280 --> 59:17.280
And I played some social.

59:17.280 --> 59:18.280
Oh God.

59:18.280 --> 59:24.080
And I got really tired of block.

59:24.080 --> 59:28.760
They just, they try too much to, a lot of those Facebook games try way too hard to get

59:28.760 --> 59:30.120
your money.

59:30.120 --> 59:34.680
Like they need, if they wanted to be smart, they would actually look at, um, like tiny

59:34.680 --> 59:37.840
tower I think is a lot more subtle about it.

59:37.840 --> 59:41.720
You know, certainly it's there and they're not shy about it, but you know, it's not like

59:41.720 --> 59:44.360
in your face all the fricking time.

59:44.360 --> 59:49.160
So it's just, plus the game show games that I play kind of do that too.

59:49.160 --> 59:50.680
I play who wants to be a millionaire as well.

59:50.680 --> 59:52.360
And it's like, you are out of shows.

59:52.360 --> 59:55.860
Do you want to buy more shows for the day?

59:55.860 --> 59:57.840
But I don't need to play more than once a day.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.680
I don't, I don't know, but that's just me.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:05.880
So it would be interesting though, if like full on streaming games, more powerful stuff

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.040
was coming to Facebook, like, cause some of the, you know, especially games like who wants

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.120
to be a millionaire and press your luck and the stuff I'm playing don't really have that

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.200
great animations and Sims social for like the week I was playing it before I blocked

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.200
it.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.800
You know, the animation's kind of old, but imagine if they could have a game like Sims

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.000
social with Sims three graphical quality to it that actually ran pretty smoothly.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.600
Gaikai could bring that, couldn't it maybe.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.920
I mean, I know we're talking about streaming, I don't know, Arkham city and things that

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.360
are already out there on the PC and stuff, but couldn't Facebook games be developed with

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
this in mind.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.240
So that's very interesting.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.080
So anyhow, well, anything is possible.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080
That's true.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080
All right, moving on.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.280
Well, coral, um, X-Box live arcade found what the filter is.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280
Okay.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.240
Well, coral is one of those, you know, word games.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:05.800
And uh, if you play it with the parental, uh, filters on, there are a bunch of words

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.780
that you can't play on the list.

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:18.040
There's help train, start dice and God, of course, balls and shaft are not allowed.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.840
Um, and then the offensive words are not allowed.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.000
Like arse, shit, fuck, cock.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.360
But now I heard that see you next Tuesday was allowed somehow was slipping through.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:42.440
Whereas all these other words are blocked, the mother of all curse words is not the source,

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:48.400
literally the source of all your cursing.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.720
You can say it, you know, I actually don't like that word, but it is a funny word.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:02:04.120
What kind of, um, there's, um, basically the other, uh, words that, uh,

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.480
Well, I can't understand what the problem is.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.200
Other words that aren't allowed are skid and poop and bung and hung and dice.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.080
Oh, great.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.680
Now it's sounding like extra first back on the show, bleached asshole.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.400
I was going to suggest that to him for that little issue he posted about.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400
Okay.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.560
So shut up.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.880
Aren't there some actual, like, so there's some words that are blocked that are like

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.360
very dictionary words.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.160
Like why are these hope help, Oh, help.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.200
I thought you said hope was hung.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:41.280
So if I want to, if I want to talk about Oscar movies, I cannot talk about the help because

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.280
it will be blocked.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.020
You also can't talk, talk about the picture you hung, huh?

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.040
You can't talk about having to poop.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:56.360
You can't start anything, but yet you can't roll the dice.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360
Gamers are beat.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.320
They're, they are discriminating against tabletop gamers because they don't let dice.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
I'm offended.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.200
They, they are, they are discriminating against my people.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.840
But here, this is the, okay.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.640
To me, this is the hilarious thing about this story and trains.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.840
So we find, Hey, my dad was a conductor for the railroad.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840
That's offensive.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840
That is offensive.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.320
You can't say train on X was ever came.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.480
But yet, yeah, here's the, this is the hilarious thing to me is that Microsoft bans all these

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.000
words for whatever reason, like maybe, I don't know, whatever.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
They're banned.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.600
Listen, the Xbox 360 does not start.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:40.040
All I have to, all I have to do is turn on my headset and all I'll hear on Xbox live

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.360
while I'm probably playing coral.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.080
Nice word, fag.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.080
This game is gay.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.700
Why are you playing this faggy gay game?

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.960
Because I saw the game blowing some guy in the back.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:58.840
Well, you're playing this game too, so nice little fag better words.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.600
It says the quote from go there.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.900
The quote from Gary Penn with Denki, the developer, it says a coral uses the Collins official

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:12.480
Scrabble dictionary comprising over 110,000 words, up to eight letters in length, including

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.080
a huge collection of words deemed offensive.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:21.920
So we're talking about like just regularly used words, you know, like how was trained

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.000
offensive?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.880
It's a really shitty band.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.320
It's a really shitty band.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.440
Unless you're, you know, maybe it's a sex move or something.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.880
The train.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.880
It's a move in fisting.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.840
You don't know what a train is?

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.880
Rob's looking it up too.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.180
You're talking about the human centipede stuff, aren't you?

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.820
My friend just bought that movie.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.720
She loves that movie.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720
Something to that effect.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.720
Yes.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.600
A train is something to that effect.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600
Okay.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.640
Except maybe not sewing someone's ass to their face.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640
It's yeah.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.640
Oh, this.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.160
Oh my God.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.240
Microsoft has forced dance central to remove one of their songs.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.640
I can't believe it.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.320
This, this song is deemed way too offensive.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:20.640
That's not like she fucking said train.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:28.400
You know, that's, that's a euphemism for big fat cock.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.880
She says, listen, she's all come on, ride the big fat cock.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.880
Lord.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.440
I see.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.040
I was thinking it was, you know, maybe a euphemism for fisting.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:53.960
Rob just turned driving sex with Muppets.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.800
Gosh.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.520
Okay.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.040
Allow me to enlighten you to what a train is.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.840
I will refer to the official source of all sorts of things like this.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840
The urban dictionary.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.840
Urban dictionary.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.840
I knew it.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.880
A group of guys stand in line outside of a room one by one and they enter a room to have

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.520
sex with one girl inside.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:20.000
The line must have at least seven guys to be qualified as a train.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
That is a train.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.280
Does that make her the caboose?

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:32.400
Well now we understand why the game has banned the word train orange on radio.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.400
Got that word ban.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.400
Thank you very much.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.400
All right.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.640
Anyhow, or, or, you know, I'm leaving the room.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.920
You guys are dirty or it would be a line of men having intercourse connected by penis

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:48.800
to ass.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:57.080
The conductor or man in the back controls, the conductor or man in the back controls

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.880
the speed while the front controls the direction of the train.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.800
As one ejaculates, he will then exit the train.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.320
We involve train sound.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320
Is it, is it, is it kind of like this?

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:17.160
I'm not sure asked to ask what the hell is asked to wrecking for a dream.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.760
Oh, it's the ass.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:20.760
All right.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.760
Anyways.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.760
Thank you.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.760
Urban dictionary.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760
Welcome.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760
All right.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760
I like how I said you're welcome as if I'm urban dictionary.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.840
All right, let's move on.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.720
Let's stop being 12 and move on to, um, travel around the world and check out what the trains

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.720
bring into a game store near you as we look at some release dates.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.200
Lots of good stuff this week, actually, uh, the only releases for this month, um, that

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.360
are worth picking up Final Fantasy 13-2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.260
Also in a collector's edition.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:55.960
If you want to buy the game with the collector's edition stuff, uh, Soul Calibur 5 on PlayStation

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.000
3 and Xbox 360 also available in a collector's edition as well.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.240
And Never Dead on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which looks like a more action-packed, slightly

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.680
less strange Shadows of the Dead.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.780
And then, um, and that's actually it.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:15.780
And then, uh, nothing.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.880
There you go.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.120
I thought we might have had, there was, I think, uh, at one point there was, uh, Pro

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.520
Evolution Soccer 2012 3D for the 3DS, but that's been delayed again.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.520
I see.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.920
3D balls were considered offensive.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:34.520
Uh, it took extra time to render the balls, you know, they had to pay special attention

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520
to the balls.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.520
Yeah, that's right.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520
Yep.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.520
I know.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520
Or else somebody might get offended.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.520
All right.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520
Moving on.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520
Let's check out what's coming out in Japan.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520
We'll start with the Xbox 360.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.680
Japan finally gets Dragon Age 2.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.720
So you can say meh, just like the rest of us.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.880
On February 2nd, 2012 is when Dragon Age 2 finally gets to Japan.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.420
Also coming to Japan on February 2nd, Never Dead and Soul Calibur 5 obviously is released

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.580
here this week and it looks like it's timed pretty well to actually be released in Japan

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.160
at the same time.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.920
Coming to the PlayStation 3, um, a lot of the same stuff, Dragon Age 2, Never Dead,

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.920
Soul Calibur 5, but you also get Gran Turismo 5 Spec 2012.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.160
Uh, I'm not sure exactly what this is, but I want to say this is probably similar, I

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.040
think you were talking about this in the show, Loki, they were going to put out like a Gran

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.520
Turismo 5 that came with a bunch of download content, like a good...

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:25.560
It came with $20 worth of download content and the Spec 2012 update.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.600
They are saying that this new update does the simplified cockpit view.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600
So I guess that's all.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.320
It's the Spec 2012 update, they were just calling something different in there.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.320
Alright, got it.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320
So that's what Japan is getting.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.120
Spec 2.0 is what they're calling it.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.880
So Japan gets that, hooray.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:44.480
The Vita is out in Japan and out this week on the Vita is Ragnarok Odyssey.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.720
Comes out from Gung-Ho and I believe, if I'm not mistaken, this is the Ragnarok Online

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.640
game on the Vita, I think.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:56.600
Although, I don't know if it's like specific, oh no, I think this is different.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.120
Ragnarok Odyssey pits gamers against giants from Norse myths, so I don't think that's

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.680
it, but it's like more of an action game.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:12.720
I saw the name and I thought maybe, maybe, alright, anyhow, um, let's see, uh, coming

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.680
out on other systems.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.320
Like a train.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.600
That's just never gonna die.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.080
I'm trying to see if anything's coming out on the Wii.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.020
It's coming out.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:32.080
On the 3DS, Fishing 3D from D3, ooh, Fishing 3D.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.080
It's almost like the real thing, just as boring.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.720
And lastly, that's it.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.120
I guess I could check the PSP real quick.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120
How about it?

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120
Photokano.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120
Okay.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.800
On the 30th, in the UK, January 30th, we have Call of Cthulhu, The Wasted Land.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.920
Call of Cthulhu.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.560
And now I have to go to February because this thing's set up really bizarre.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.680
And in February, on the 1st, we have Rhythm Party, ooh, on the 2nd, we have Pixel Junk

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:12.760
Eden, and on the 3rd, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, Never Dead,

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.520
and Soulcalibur V.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.120
Shane knows a lot about the Vita and what's going on and says that Ragnarok Odyssey is

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.760
partially the people that did Ragnarok Online.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:28.160
So it's not Ragnarok Online, but it's like them, a lot of the same people making a new

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160
thing.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.160
Aye.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.160
So there you go.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.160
Just thought you wanna know.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.800
Alright, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna get into the classic game

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.800
of the week.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.840
So let's go to Loki.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:44.280
It's like Ragnarok Wi-Fi ad hoc.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.680
Yes, it's just like that.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.080
With a 3G connection provided by AT&T, yes.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.400
Yes, well in Japan it would be something else.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.400
So yeah, the Vita's getting hacked, as usual.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.240
But it's not exactly the Vita getting hacked, it's more of the Playstation 3 getting hacked

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.960
and the Vita kind of benefiting from said hack.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.160
Of course with the power of custom firmwares on the Playstation 3, and this has been something

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:18.520
that they did with the PSP before where they added more games supported through remote

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.080
play, they have done the same with the Vita.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:28.440
Now you can support more games via remote play on the Vita, including Batman Arkham

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.200
Asylum, Battlefield 3, Alice in Madness Returns, Mortal Kombat, and Red Dead Redemption.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.600
However, the games display a hefty amount of input lag.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:46.360
Also, they had some extra games that they're gonna be supporting via remote play, including

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:56.040
Killzone 3, but those are not yet supported.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.240
But it looks like, if I remember correctly, with the PSP there were a lot of games that

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.560
didn't have remote play enabled, but with hacks were able to get remote play enabled

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.100
on those, and they actually worked just fine.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:16.080
So there may be more games beyond just those five that they will work and work well.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.080
So they have videos online too if you wanna check them out.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.160
I mean, I think it'd be pretty awesome to play Battlefield 3 on the Vita or Red Dead.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.360
I didn't even think about that the PSP and the PlayStation 3 already have similar connectivity,

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.120
you know, and it's one of the most underlooked features in the PSP, so the Vita ought to

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.080
kick it up, and you should be able to play, like, PS3 games streaming, right?

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.880
Yes, and especially since the controls will be nice instead of having to worry about before

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.600
where, oh, I only have one analog stick, you know, and now you have dual analog, and to

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:52.880
be honest, I mean, they should be supporting, you know, the L2R2 just by tapping a portion

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.840
of the back touch panel, and then you have pretty much full compatibility with, you know,

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:05.240
the DualShock controls, so assuming that you're not gonna run to input lag that's gonna really

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.320
affect your game, I don't see why more games aren't supporting this.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.880
All right, well, I'm hoping to see more of this kind of technology coming to the Vita,

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:20.080
because I gotta say, if I could play, like, Final Fantasy XIII-2 on my Vita, like, while

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.480
I'm in bed, like, you know, just do a little bit of the, do a little bit of the grinding

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.960
in my bedroom.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.160
I'm in experience grinding, you sick perv, stop laughing over there, DarkSakura.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.400
You certainly are experienced, huh?

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400
Bitch.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400
All right.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.200
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.840
I would, I would love to do that, like, that would be so awesome, like, it's almost like

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:47.160
a, I mean, what, isn't the Wii U's whole point kind of moot if the PlayStation can do that

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.160
same thing?

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.160
Sort of.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.720
Sort of, except for the fact that it'll be a way more expensive on the PlayStation 3,

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.720
I'm sure.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.720
But it's just, I don't know.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.680
AlphaCananagram wants to make a good point, though.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:03.680
The thing is, PS3 is Wi-Fi G, not Wi-Fi N, so it's gonna suck.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:10.200
Yes, but at the same time, you know, who's to say the next system's not gonna be, I'd

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.080
assume the next system's gonna be Wi-Fi N.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.000
Are you already thinking about Vita II?

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
No, I'm talking about the, um...

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.200
Oh, oh, the, oh, I'm sorry, the PS3.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200
Oh, that's a good point.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.080
I don't know if the Vita is N. I think it might be.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.080
It just occurred to me.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.080
Might be G.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:29.600
There's another game that I played today, but we're bringing it up.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.480
I played with the Sony tablet.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480
Oh?

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.960
Um, the, what's it called, the tablet S, and it has PlayStation games on it, but I was

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.880
playing the Uncharted pinball game today.

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880
Oh.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.720
But it was, I was thinking about that, you know, if they've got PlayStation, um, I think

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:55.160
it said some PS2 games, too, on, um, on their little tablet, then it actually seems to,

01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:00.680
you know, that it wouldn't be that hard for them to have the Vita that played, you know,

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.800
your PS3 games.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.800
AlphaCananagram has another great suggestion here.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:10.500
They need to release an updated PS3 or some sort of dongle to upgrade the Wi-Fi N, for

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:16.280
the Vita's Wi-Fi N. And dongle, who, he's changed his name, is confirming the Vita does

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.840
have an N in it.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:26.400
To be honest, you could do that with a Wi-Fi N bridge, um, you could, you know, upgrade

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.360
your connection or, you know, have a router that's Wi-Fi N that you connect, you know,

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.680
physically to your PS3 and then have it stream from there.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:40.120
But yeah, I mean, next system, you know, obviously gonna be N, probably will be able to support

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.800
a lot more streaming, especially if you're gonna be downloading games and stuff, and

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.320
I mean, that could be kinda cool.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.720
You could see a lot of new functionality with the Vita with that, um, although by the time

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:54.200
that that system comes out, the Vita could be dead in the water already, so, let's hope

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.200
not.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:02.760
Alright, well, let's move on to another story here I have on THQ, of course, the makers

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.880
of Saints Row, right?

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.280
Uh, apparently it's gonna be refocusing a bit over THQ.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.080
First, I should say this, there were some crazy-ass rumors this week that THQ was, like,

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.760
gonna just fuckin' fold.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.760
Like, right?

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.440
Weren't they going around Twitter like THQ is just done, they're waiting, they're gonna

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.440
get bought.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.880
That was like a couple weeks ago that they were, like, gonna stop.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.320
Oh, we haven't been here for a couple weeks.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.880
Well, they had canceled their 2014 portfolio.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.040
Oh yeah, they canceled their entire 2014 lineup, yes, I remember now.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.960
Well, here's what happened is that what's actually happening is that THQ is going to

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:38.760
renew its focus to be on core game franchises and not traditional kids licensed video games.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.520
Sorry, guys, no more SpongeBob SquarePants.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.720
And somebody else will pick up the license, I'm sure.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:50.760
But anyway, um, UFC, Darksiders, Company of Heroes, Insane, Saints Row, Warhammer 40k,

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.640
and so on, these are all still in production and there will be that going forward.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.760
They have a ton of fuckin' titles coming out.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.620
I mean, I'm not surprised that they're, I mean, look at the titles that are coming out

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:01.620
from THQ.

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:05.000
They have the fuckin' South Park RPG game that's coming out at the end of the year.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.080
I mean, they've got plenty of big titles.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.200
I mean, they're on par with, like, EA and, you know, Activision, I mean, they're easily

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.120
one of the top three.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.800
I mean, hell, even First Party can't really top, you know, I mean, First Party doesn't

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.720
have a lot of titles coming out anymore, but yeah, they're not going anywhere.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:27.560
I mean, if you're gonna see another company die, it's gonna be, like, Konami or, you know,

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:34.400
maybe even, like, Capcom, one of the smaller guys, like, D3, you know, I can see them folding.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.200
South Peak, they could have very well already folded.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.400
Yeah, it's gonna be one of those.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.400
It's not gonna be THQ.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.520
They're not gonna just all of a sudden get bought out.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.400
They have a ton of properties.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:50.160
Well, one thing that didn't work out so well for them was the U-Draw tablet, and I think

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.560
that's part of what's probably not going to be so much coming out of THQ in the future.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.800
Hey, did you remember the Ubisoft tablet that they had?

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.800
No.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.400
Yeah, that's, nobody did either.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.720
That came out around Christmas.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.880
Um, what, I thought one of those tablets did quite well.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.880
Was that the first?

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.200
It was the first U-Draw on the Wii.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.320
But then when they tried to kind of put it everywhere, it didn't do so well, right?

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.320
And I don't really know if it did well, it did alright, but I'm glad that's gone, because

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:23.920
it was, it had potential, but what, the problem with that tablet is you didn't have anybody

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.680
coming on, like, they were saying, oh yeah, Nintendo's gonna develop some titles for the

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.680
U-Draw tablet.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.020
If they had done that, then yeah, it would have kicked ass on the Wii, but since there

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:38.760
wasn't a Mario Paint or anything like that on the U-Draw, it just died, you know, no

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.760
one cares.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.360
Because it's a peripheral that's going to be used for a couple of games, and that's

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360
it.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:50.200
Alright, well, let's take a minute to go down memory lane, and think about a time when we

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.720
weren't so worried about games' financial situations, we didn't have these tablet things

01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:00.880
that were coming out and destroying game companies, it's the classic game of the week.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.040
Dark Soccer is going to dive head first into the classic gaming vault and find a game that

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.480
she says, hey, you kids, better respect.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.640
And you picked a real oldie but goodie tonight, didn't you?

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.160
I picked one of my favorite old games.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.840
Alright, and you think, how many episodes have you done the classic game of the week

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840
now?

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.840
It started episode 250, right?

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.520
So damn near 200 classic games of the week.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.520
Yeah.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:27.080
And you're still finding ones you kind of forgot, or whatever, just never did before.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:36.480
Well, and actually this game last night from Dan and I, we were watching this, like, series

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.000
of Colecovision games.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.280
So I had to go back to the Colecovision with something that I grew up with.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.280
So I picked Mousetrap.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.280
Mousetrap.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.440
Now tell me if you remember this gaming company, Exedy.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.720
You know what Exedy stands for?

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.360
I didn't know it stood for anything.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.320
Is the portmanteau of excellence in dynamics.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.720
I didn't know that.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.680
I remember the name Exedy, though.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.680
Yeah.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.200
So maybe it's Exedy, since it's dynamics.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:08.080
Anyway, Mousetrap was basically, I don't know what everyone's going to say, it was a Pac-Man

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.080
clone.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:16.920
Well, unlike Zynga, Exedy decided to actually innovate on the genre and throw in a few other

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.600
twists.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:25.160
With Mousetrap, and the one that I linked, and if you will share that with Rama, I shared

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.880
the Colecovision version because that's the one that I grew up with.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:34.720
Although it was in the arcade, it was a pretty good game, the Atari version is shit.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.560
So moving forward, you've got these, you play as a mouse and you're being chased by cats

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:45.920
and you are eating up little pieces of cheese and you can collect bones.

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.840
Now the bones, as opposed to how the power pills work, you store up your bones and you

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.600
activate them at a certain time that you choose.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.320
You can save all of your bones and not use them in that level.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.760
I mean, you don't, you have to start over the next level, but still, you know, you don't

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.200
have to use all your bones.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.860
But with, you have the bones, you turn into a dog and the dog, you know, bites the cats

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.160
and sends the cats back into their little places that aren't in the center of the screen,

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.800
they are on the, uh, each side of the screen.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.560
In the center, you have a little area that says in, and when you go through the in, it

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:24.280
actually puts you into one of the four corners at random, you don't get to control.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.440
Actually, I think there was a way to determine which one, but I think it had, depending on

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.880
how you entered the little thing.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:38.640
So, um, you, uh, actually, instead of there being four enemies on screen, you had six

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.640
cats.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:45.320
And they, uh, had point multipliers, 100 for the first, 300 for the second, 500 for

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:52.000
the third, 700, 900, and that was it.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.040
And of course, it resets every time you use a new bone.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.440
Um, now, the cats, though, will respawn faster.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.360
As you got through later levels, you also had a hawk that would pop up that would, uh,

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:09.580
eat both the mouse and the dog, if you were the dog, and you, um, the only way to get,

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:14.080
to change its direction from going right after you, was to go in the infield in the center

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.020
so that it would just go to a random place.

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:22.560
You also had, uh, bonus, um, items that, when you got one, a next one would appear, and

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.880
your bonus items, they would also be towards the different corners.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:30.920
Uh, there are a thousand points each and would increase by 200 points for each subsequent

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.720
ply, so the last one was 7,200 points.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:38.280
The items are, there's 32 of them, there's a wedge of swiss cheese, a paperclip, a safety

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:42.760
pin, a key, an apple, a trophy, a candlestick, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, a pair

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:47.560
of eyeglasses, a clock, a bottle, a gem, a bugle, a screw, a hammer, a diamond ring,

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.040
a lightbulb, a sewing needle, a fork, a thimble, a knife, a cocktail glass, a fishbone, a pear,

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:59.040
a peanut, a dye, a telephone handset, a dye with C-A-F on the faces, I guess that would

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:03.640
be like a block, a spool of thread, a teacup, and a pistol, what a mouse needs a pistol

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:07.800
for, and a martini glass, and eyeglasses, I have no freaking clue.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.500
Some of the 80s games had the strangest power-ups in them, though, you know.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:18.580
You also get a 10,000 point bonus for clearing the board of all cheese, and if you end the

01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:23.680
stage as the dog, you will begin the next stage as the dog, which is kind of stupid

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.120
because the cats don't really appear.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:31.320
Now here is, I think, the really innovative part of the game, are the doors.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:36.760
And with the doors, you had three different colors, you had a yellow, a red, and a blue

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.000
door, that if you pressed that colored button, the door would open and close.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.960
And my goal, every time I played the damn game, was to trap the cats.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.440
And I was really good at trapping the cats, because then you trap the cats, you don't

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.680
have to worry about them hunting you down.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.960
You just, you know, you may have to go around another door, but, you know, what's a little

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.200
inconvenience for safety, you know?

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.200
Right.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.120
Now this is not to be confused, as some people are saying in the chat room here, the board

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.640
game, yes, Torment is saying, my mom loved that game, she would set up for hours playing

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.720
Mouse Trap, but there was somebody else that says that before that, Torment didn't just

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:17.680
come out and say that, somebody said, somebody said something about the board game in there.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.760
The board game is not the same as the arcade game.

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.600
But the board game is awesome in its own way.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.320
And it had lots of breakable parts, and it really pissed me off.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.320
Yes.

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.240
I could never get the little dude to flip the right way at the end.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.280
So yeah, my thing was always trapping the cats, and then just having free reign of the

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:42.120
board, and, oh, I can take my time, ooh, look at you mousies, I mean, kitty cats trapped

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.120
in the little areas.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.120
So there were different ports.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:53.320
Like I said, I had the ColecoVision version, which to me was the most true version, I think.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:58.480
It had fewer prizes, and you could actually have an option to leave out the hawk, and

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.400
the sound effects were a little different, but as far as, you know, having the doors

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.400
and everything, it was probably the closest to the arcade you could get.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:15.040
The Intellivision one actually added an audio warning when the cats were entering the maze,

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.480
but the graphics were blockier.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:23.440
And then the Atari 2600 version, okay, you know how awful Pac-Man looked on the Atari

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.440
2600?

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:30.840
Yeah, I'm looking at the videos now, because I want to say I played this one.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.120
Similarly hideous.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.560
And no sound.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:36.560
Very quiet.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.840
Block, block, block, block, block, block.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.340
Actually my friend had this game, we used to play this all the time, but it only had

01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.340
the one door.

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:49.400
Yeah, only the one color door, and it flickers instead of really opens, it just vanishes.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.400
Yeah.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:58.640
So it's not really good, and you had reduced scoring in it, it had no hawk, the in area

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.960
is missing, like from the center, so you didn't have your little teleport boxes.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.840
You only have three cats instead of six, and all the doors move at the same time.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.200
So it was really just bastardized.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.560
However, now, you remember the song Pac-Man Fever, Rob?

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.360
Of course I do.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:25.960
Pac-Man Fever, Bugner and Garcia, well they also did a song called Mouse Trap on the same

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.960
album.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.760
I did not know that.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.720
It was made using the sound effects from the game.

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.360
A little note on here from the article I'm reading is that when they re-recorded the

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:44.080
album in 1999, they could not find the machine, and so had to use sounds from nature.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.680
Let's see, I'm actually, I found it here on the good old YouTube that has everything.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:28:05.200
Wow, they do really just sing about the game, don't they?

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:12.440
Well, they do with Pac-Man Fever.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.760
Rest in peace by the way, that guy died last year.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.320
One of them, there was two of the guys died last year.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.320
Anyhow.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:26.200
So that's the game, and again, it was one of my all-time favorites, and my mother would

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.320
sit and play this for hours, although her game was Space Fury.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.320
Alright.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.640
Classic Game of the Week, folks, is Mouse Trap for the ColecoVision, or you know, really

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:37.960
it did start in the arcade, so there it is.

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.560
I'm gonna say, if you want to play it at home, without maim, ColecoVision.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.000
Alright, that's the way to go.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.080
We're gonna be back, there's plenty more of Orange Laundrio to come.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.080
We have a list list tonight.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.520
We're gonna be doing a list list, tonight's list list is inspired by Twitter.

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.440
There was a listener on Twitter that said you should do this as a topic, and I'm like,

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.440
okay, we can do that.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.180
So we are gonna do a list list, Alan's gonna join us for that here in a little bit, and

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.800
we'll get to more of that in part B, and we're gonna talk a little bit about a new pocket

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.760
system that could have Dark Sakura, very excited, we'll see some other Nintendo updates and

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.760
more when we come back.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:17.160
Your calls and your Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, get those in, and plenty more

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:26.200
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.080
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:34.800
We are live on January the 29th of 2012 with the 443rd episode of our show.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.120
You know, if you've never listened to Orange Lounge Radio live, you really should consider

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.120
it sometime.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:42.280
We are, of course, I do something, I know some of our listeners are overseas, so like

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.920
if you guys are in Europe, it is really hard to listen to our show unless you have severe

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.920
insomnia.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.320
So I apologize for that, but that is why we have a podcast.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.860
But for those of you guys who are in the States, your excuses are severely numbered.

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:58.720
So we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, of course,

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.220
and we do have the chat room.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:03.360
And when you're not here with us in live chat, you miss fun things like Dark Sakura's having

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.040
a contest right now.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.480
Whoever can guess her bra size gets to buy her a taco.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:15.080
Now, I'm not sure how there's a winner in that situation.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.640
There's two winners and they're both me because everyone gets to know what a fantastic rack

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.640
I have.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.640
And I also get a taco.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.640
Can I just put pics on OLR?

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:24.640
No.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:25.640
No.

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.320
And then I am kind of wearing a cleavage-y shirt today.

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320
OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.800
Actually, I keep saying OLR.com, but that's not our site.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.080
And my hair is cute.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.080
You do look cute today.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.440
I put effort into my hair today.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.400
Considering how, like, shitty I felt, mad you were, I don't know, yeah, angsty you were

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400
earlier.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:47.240
A, you've seemed like the show has helped you unwind a little bit, and B, you might

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.520
be in a bad mood, but you're looking good.

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.520
Oh, yeah.

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.520
Yeah.

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.120
Pissy bitch gotta be hot.

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:55.520
All right.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.520
All right.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.880
We're going to do some rapid-fire news.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.840
Believe it or not, we're not just a video game show about boobies.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.600
Although, don't get me wrong, everybody loves boobies.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.600
Loki?

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.600
Boobies?

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.960
He gave the big thumbs up.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.960
Great radio.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.960
Dark Sakura?

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:12.960
Boobies?

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.960
Yeah.

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.960
And I love boobies, too.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960
Boobies are great.

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.960
Oh, is Dark Sakura taking a picture of her boobies?

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.560
I'm just gonna put a picture up.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.560
Oh, okay.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.320
That kind of comes with the radio show territory.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.320
What?

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.320
Taking pictures of boobs.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:33.320
It's just, you know, you eventually devolve into that type of show.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.320
Yeah.

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.320
There's the picture.

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.320
See?

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.320
You gotta put that on the site.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320
I am.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.320
All right.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.320
Moving on.

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.320
All right.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.320
Let's talk about Skylanders.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:46.320
Yay.

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.320
Skylanders.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320
Your favorite game.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320
It's my favorite game.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.320
What a different type of boob.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.320
Hey, you know what?

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.320
Here's the thing.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:57.980
You can't win here if you can't avoid them, then at least benefit from them, but that's

01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:58.980
another story.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:31:59.980
Anyways, Skylanders.

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:06.520
So, apparently Activision has grabbed the rights to a domain called Skylanders Giants,

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:11.640
so you can probably guess that's probably gonna be the next Skylander game or whatever.

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:16.120
So Skylander Giants coming to a store near you.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.360
You wanna hear something funny?

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:24.920
So as I mentioned weeks prior that those toys are so hard to find right now that they're

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:32.760
going for astronomical prices on auction sites like eBay and Amazon, Activision, cause most

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:38.040
companies eventually they will drop the price of their merchandise.

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.400
Oh no, no, no, no.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:42.360
They are raising the price of the merchandise.

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.280
Those toys, remember how they used to cost you like eight bucks or whatever?

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.160
They're gonna cost you one additional dollar to buy that.

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.520
That's like, that'd be like those Call of Duty map packs selling so well that they're

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.280
gonna charge more money for them.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.280
But guess what?

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.400
You stupid fuckers will keep buying them.

01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:01.960
And so that's why Skylanders Giants is allowed to exist.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.720
So don't you fucking bitch and complain about your goddamn map packs costing too much because

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:10.200
it's all your fucking fault for buying those stupid Skylander toys.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.200
Why are you so angry?

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.200
You're so angry.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:14.760
Yeah, I'm not fucking angry.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:18.280
I'll make a quick buck off of those fucking toys.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:22.360
So whatever, you know.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.520
I'm gonna be laughing all the way to the bank.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:29.200
Because you people can't get your hands on those toys.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:36.200
Anyways, Capcom has announced Ace Eternity 5 that's gonna be coming out soon thanks to

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:39.220
their wonderful logo which is completely in Japanese.

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:43.720
But I do see a five, so I know that it's Ace Eternity 5.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:49.280
And of course they've offered nothing whatsoever as far as specifics about the game, but eh,

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.280
whatever.

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:57.040
And also there's the Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney series for the 3DS that's been

01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.400
announced and the game's due out this year.

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:06.040
And also of course they're gonna be doing some HD versions of some of the older Ace

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.040
Attorney games.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:16.640
One through three are coming to IOS platforms soon with refresh sprites and that fun stuff.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.280
And last but not least, there's a new game coming out on the Playstation 3 for the Move.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:30.720
And it's gonna allow you to use your Playstation Move controllers to engage in combat.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:37.960
Looks almost like that Kinect game that they have coming out from the guys that do Crysis

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:38.960
from Crytek.

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.160
Very, you know, Roman combat type stuff.

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:51.560
Anyways, the game's called Quandramortis and it's done by the guys that did the fight the

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.560
lights out.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.640
So they know a little bit about battle games.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.000
They also know about games that don't sell well.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.040
So it's hard to say whether that game will do well or not.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.040
Yeah.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:07.920
And you'll be able to fight against your friends over the Playstation.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:14.720
Also if you happen to not want to engage in move combat or multi-move controller combat,

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.880
you can still use a regular controller as well.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.800
So it's nice to at least have that option in there.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.800
All right.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.680
Well, moving on to some other rapid fire news.

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.900
I think I need a correct musical background for this because it's one of the greatest

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.960
theme songs ever.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.960
Hopefully it'll work.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:37.320
It's the Muppet Show!

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:48.520
Ah, that's right, I played this song because Muppets DLC is coming to LittleBigPlanet 2!

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:50.520
That's right, Sackboys will meet the Muppets.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.520
This is going to be so awesome.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:58.320
Like, I have to admit, I'm so embarrassed because I never really got into LittleBigPlanet

01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.320
2.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.320
Like, I never just bought it because I was like, oh no, there's a stellar game right

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.320
now.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.320
I can't do it.

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.320
But I love LittleBigPlanet 1.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.480
So this might seriously push me over the edge right here.

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.080
I've got to get LittleBigPlanet 2 because now there's Muppet DLC in it.

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.240
It's going to have two new minigames, five new levels, a new soundtrack, objects, voices,

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:19.760
new trophies, twelve new kids, and a Ralph the Dog costume.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:21.120
Outstanding.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:26.600
It's going to cost $5.99 and it actually just came out this week.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.520
Also a new game mechanic is the Attract-O-Gel.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.140
Now Sackboy can walk on walls and ceilings.

01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:37.600
And any object can do the same thanks to the Attract-O-Gel.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.600
Amazing.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.080
You know, I haven't played through LittleBigPlanet 2 at all, other than like the first level

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.080
or so.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.640
I should probably go back.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.640
Oh man.

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:48.960
It's just one of those games that unfortunately just came out at a really bad time, so I kind

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.960
of missed it.

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.320
The first one was so, so good.

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.600
I can't imagine how the second one is suddenly bad.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:01.520
Anyhow, rumors going around, big rumors that Wii U might change their name.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:07.500
Nintendo is seriously considering renaming the Wii U and it has to do with the fact that,

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.200
I guess a lot of people were confused by the 3DS and the fact that the 3DS and the way

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.000
they're kind of selling it looks so similar to the DS that people think the 3DS is just

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.660
a souped up DS, although I'm kind of like, well that's what it is, isn't it?

01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:22.880
But whatever.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.560
So Nintendo is very scared about this because maybe it's too similar.

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.080
So they're thinking that folks will see Wii U and think it's just the same thing, that

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.840
they already have one at home.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.440
I don't know how much I'm on board with this, but I don't really care for the name Wii U,

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.240
but then again I didn't really like the name Wii and it kind of grew on everybody, so those

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.880
jokes will never get old.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.560
I'm noticing this thread on Destructoid, which is one of the sites that ran the news story,

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:54.260
had some comments for people suggesting a new name and a lot of people are suggesting

01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:59.080
a lot of the development names like Ultra, Dolphin, whatever, but I think honestly the

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:04.400
best name I saw in here was Nintendo HD.

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.040
What a great name for the console, just fucking call it what it is.

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.040
It's Nintendo HD.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.680
I think that's the best suggestion I saw in there.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:14.280
Loki you look like you're wanting to comment on this or something.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.800
That sounds fine to me, that makes sense.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.800
Wii U, do you love the name Wii U?

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.280
Do you hope it sticks?

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:27.580
Well I am very fond of the movie Kung Pao and yes, Wii U does tie into Kung Pao quite

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:33.760
a lot, so I am hoping it sticks just because of all the wonderful Kung Pao clips they get

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.760
to watch.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.760
Wii U, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U.

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.740
You should be able to beat him now.

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:45.080
Also Nintendo has announced that at their recent online thing that they do with investors,

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.400
one of the other things they talked about, not just the Nintendo network, but another

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:54.020
little gem slipped in there, a new 2D Mario game that will be released in the next fiscal

01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:59.620
year, meaning before March 2013, that will be on the 3DS.

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.800
So I know that sounds a little weird because we're talking a 2D game on the 3DS, but think

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.440
New Super Mario Brothers Wii, something like that, on the 3DS, which wouldn't surprise

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.940
anybody because that was a huge seller, and that's a game I'm sure they could crank out

01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:12.940
no problem.

01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:16.400
New Super Mario Brothers Wii wasn't a bad game by any means either.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.400
It was pretty good.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.560
Yeah, I already played that on my 3DS, it was called New Super Mario Brothers for the

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.280
3DS.

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:29.280
Well there'll probably be a 3D one of those as well that just has slight 3D in it or something.

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.600
But I wouldn't go expecting Mario 3D Land.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.600
But you know what, who gives a shit, you know what, you don't need to even fucking change

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.600
any of the goddamn game mechanics as long as you make completely all new levels.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:44.280
No one cares, it's just, it's a Mario game, oh my god.

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.040
Just make really fun levels and done.

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.760
You don't need to like, make something brand new every time.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.960
That's not to say that you shouldn't make brand new things because, you know, they've

01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:02.400
been, you know, they've had the problem with releasing games that they've changed nothing

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:09.960
for like ages on, Animal Crossing, or you know, it's just like any of the new play control

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:10.960
things.

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.280
I mean, they should change a little bit, but you know, it's not to say that the old stuff

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.040
wasn't good.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:22.920
Some comments on our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, Rama says, no, just call it Nintendo.

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.960
The Nintendo, Nintendo.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.380
You know, that's been suggested a lot, and that was even rumored, one of the titles at

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:34.360
one point, but the NES was the Nintendo, and I think, I don't know, I just, I like Nintendo

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:40.520
HD or Wii HD, just something, I like to keep it simple, but that might be too simple.

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:44.520
Call it the Nintendo money press because it prints money.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:49.560
Some other comments on our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, Dongle says, give me true Super Mario World

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.600
sequel with 2D art in 3D.

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.560
AhMyEye says, I want a good Yoshi's Island sequel.

01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:01.840
Well, yeah, Super Mario Bros. 2 Yoshi's Island, that was one of the best.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.840
Weeee, weeee, weeee, weeee.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.840
No, thank you.

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:05.840
All right.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.400
Anyhow, let's move on, DarkSakura.

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.120
Well, we do have a few other things.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:16.360
It would also be good if I did not have the mailbag pulled up over it.

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.800
So how about Street Fighter X Tekken?

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:29.600
There's some interesting news, and that is a weird picture of Mega Man.

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:30.840
It's Mr. Mega Man.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:31.840
Mr. Mega Man?

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.920
Well, it's technically Mega Man.

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:42.640
He's in the pose from the American box art for the first Mega Man, and that's just weird.

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.600
Also, the image of his showing, so I can link it in the chatroom, so.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:52.080
But it was, yeah, bizarre.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.520
And also Pac-Man's in it, which I don't get.

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.240
Well, the Pac-Man thing was cool.

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.040
Have you seen the trailer with him in action yet?

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.040
No.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.040
Because it's, okay.

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.200
Pac-Man, this is worth, yeah, because this is the weird thing.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:07.840
Like, Pac-Man sounds stupid to me, but wait until you see what they did to Pac-Man.

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.680
You're gonna say the same thing I did, I bet.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:11.520
Well, it said with mechanical assistance.

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.640
Well, it's a very specific mechanical.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640
It's Pac-Man.

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:16.560
Let her see, because she's a Tekken fan.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.160
Don't spoil it!

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.520
Or I will throw a cartoon Megan Fox at you.

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.520
All right, let's see.

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:25.520
Ah, here it is.

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.160
Okay, let's, uh, I hope this isn't some stupid-ass parody or something.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.720
Let's see here.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.160
No!

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:33.160
I hate YouTube advertisements.

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.160
Damn it.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.160
Damn it.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.160
Damn it.

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.160
All right, hold on.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.160
We gotta...

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.160
It's some dude proposing to some chick.

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.160
No, no, no, no.

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.160
She's not gonna marry you.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.160
What?

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.160
What were you saying?

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.160
It's a stupid commercial.

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:47.520
Oh, we're not gonna watch the stupid commercial.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.760
We had to get through it.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.760
We had to get through it.

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:50.760
Here we go.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:51.760
Warning.

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.760
The following trailer may...

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:53.760
God damn it!

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:54.760
It's just some...

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.760
Ah, I see a lot of warnings.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:58.760
I don't think that was...

01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:01.400
I hate when people take the videos and...

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.400
There we go.

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.400
That was just on it, Rob.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.400
Oh.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.400
Ah, you ruined it.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.400
Sorry, I closed it.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.400
Hold on.

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.400
Let me do one more.

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:09.400
This is great, great radio.

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.400
Let's try this one.

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:11.400
Geez, Rob.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:12.400
That's a website I know.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.400
So this ought to be something I can trust.

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.400
I like machinima.

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.400
Come on.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.400
Play the trailer.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.400
Here we go.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.400
Crude humor.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:25.400
That's like this show with its trains.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:38.240
I love the cat.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.240
So Mega Man looks terrible.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.240
The fuck is that?

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:49.480
Oh, he's in the Tetsujin outfit.

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480
That is cool.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480
Okay, cool's okay.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:55.480
Cool makes sense.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:03.880
Yay, Kuro and Toto.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:10.360
That's awful.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.240
They've got to be just trolling us with that.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.400
No, that's the real deal.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.480
It has, um, what's his name's Kenji Nefuni's blessing.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.120
No, no, no, hold on.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.280
It has his blessing from a year ago.

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.520
Prior to the whole Mega Man stuff being canceled prior to him leaving the company.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:26.520
Yeah.

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.320
He's like, Hey, you wanted to use that in the game?

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.320
Okay.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.320
Yeah, sure.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.320
That's fine.

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.320
I'm going to work on making Mega Man Legends three.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320
Oh, by the way, we're letting you go.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:38.600
Or it's like, yeah, that, that is the whole, yeah.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.080
Blessing from a year ago is what he has.

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:44.920
But I mean, now it's just like fans are pissed off that you won't make a mega game.

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.200
He won't put Mega Man in Mega Man, you know, ultimate, uh, Marvel vs Capcom three.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.960
And then you pull this fucking shit.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.360
You might as well just dressed up Frank West as Mega Man, cause that would be less offensive

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.360
than this.

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.200
It's funny watching what's happening because a lot of people are like, like it's really

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.840
interesting cause a lot of gamers are looking at this going, not funny.

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.040
This is not funny.

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.120
Like gamers.

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.880
I feel like gamers are like actually offended by that.

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.020
Let's let's let's dark soccer.

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:10.520
You just saw it for the first time.

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.640
Are you having that reaction to, it's not funny.

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.200
I feel like I've got to throw up.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.400
I mean, I'm not, I have a headache now.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:23.320
I started to have a headache earlier and it was going away as I started to feel better,

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:25.840
but now I feel nauseous and my headache has come back.

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.480
Think about Pac-Man as Mokujin, cause that is kind of awesome.

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480
That's Tetsujin.

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480
Oh, I thought it was Mokujin.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480
It was the metal outfit.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480
Oh, okay.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480
Tetsujin means iron.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:34.600
Ah, got it.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.960
Now Moku would, now listen, I mean, now I can speak Japanese.

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.560
Domo Oregato, Mr. Roboto.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.320
Hey, here's another, another lesson.

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.660
Moku Yobi is Wednesday.

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.320
No one curry.

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:55.320
I mean, I was just going to say that, uh, doesn't Capcom understand that these fucking

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.720
characters are not part of Street Fighter or Tekken?

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:04.240
I mean, I understand that they want to do like a SNK versus, you know, a Namco versus

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.440
Capcom game or something like that.

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:10.360
But there was a Namco cross Capcom game, but it wasn't a fighting game.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:14.360
Why didn't they just do, you know, instead of Street Fighter cross Tekken, why don't

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:17.600
they just do Namco cross Capcom, the fighting game?

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.880
Cause that's what this is.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.480
Like they had the fucking final fight characters.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:23.160
They have Cole, which I'm that cool.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.720
You got your exclusive characters for the PlayStation.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.680
Cole isn't either one, but okay.

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:28.680
Whatever.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.720
You know, and, and like Pac-Man stuff, it just doesn't make any sense.

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:35.720
And none for Xbox buy.

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.920
The only cool thing about this Pac-Man Pac-Man's adorable.

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:43.200
See right before you watch that trailer, you're like, what the fuck Pac-Man?

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:45.280
Like that's not going to make sense when you're watching it like, Oh, okay.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.280
That's right.

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280
Mega Man.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.280
What'd they do to Mega Man?

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:51.340
That's like the exact same reaction the rest of the internet had.

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:58.720
He's like, not even, you know, kind of lean and mean looking, but he's, it looks like

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.440
he's been eating too many donuts.

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.520
He looks like Mega Man going through a midlife crisis.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.720
It looks like I put on a Mega Man outfit.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.720
No.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.320
Rob, you would look better than that dude.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.800
Oh, well thank you.

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:09.800
All right.

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:10.800
Next story.

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:11.800
Yes.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.280
I know about some Doctor Who news.

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:21.760
There will be a two Doctor Who games that are going to be on the PC, PlayStation three

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:30.280
and actually there's, there were two, there is a Doctor Who, the eternity clock is going

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:40.000
to come out on March, 2012 and it is going to be a, well it has the silence and apparently

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.400
a bunch of the other bad guys who like the Daleks cause you can't have a Doctor Who game

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.780
without the Daleks being all over at exterminate.

01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:52.120
So next news, um, we're not having a BlizzCon next year.

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.440
No BlizzCon.

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.720
As in this year?

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:55.720
This year.

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.720
Yeah.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.560
That means that I won't be able to do disc on like I did last year.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.840
Oh yeah.

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:09.680
No BlizzCon because apparently they are so busy with Diablo three and the pandas and

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:15.760
the Titan MMO who that they're just not going to do it or they just have nothing to show

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:16.760
us.

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:17.760
I mean, let's be real.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.760
They have nothing to show us.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:19.760
Everything.

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.760
We already know everything.

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:24.280
Titans not ready to show and you know, whatever the next next expansion is for a while.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:29.560
They're not going to show this or little pandas, but they didn't have a BlizzCon in 2006 so

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:32.240
folks do need to realize it was never supposed to be an annual event.

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.080
It just kind of worked out that way.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:39.720
All pandas I'm going to have you realize I have saved the name fatty cakes to make my

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.720
Panda.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:41.720
I know.

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.160
What did I call my mud slapper after it was, you don't, we were playing around the, you

01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:51.040
don't know Jack and I think it was, is it one of Baskin Robbins 31 flavors or is it

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.040
a term for a fart and mud slapper came up and I'm like, I'm going to name my pandar

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.040
in that.

01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.040
I almost, that's a fart.

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:04.120
I almost did, um, named, named, uh, named her after my would name my Panda after my

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.120
current druid.

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.720
And they made her pond arena.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.720
Nice.

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.400
All right.

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:11.000
That's it for rapid fire news.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.240
I think we've been promising this for some time now.

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:20.680
I think it's time to get into tonight's list list.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:27.240
Tonight's list list topic is what bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U Xbox lube

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.400
or PlayStation four.

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:33.080
This was inspired by a tweet that was sent to me earlier this week for message J one

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.280
hundred, Matt that said the next listless or match game should feature gaming bullshit

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.520
rumors because, uh, I was tweeting about the whole ridiculousness of some of the Xbox rumors

01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:46.700
that were going around and he suggested that and I said, you know what, consider it done.

01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:47.700
So here it is.

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:52.900
What bullshit rumor will be next about the Wii U Xbox lube or PlayStation four.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:55.800
If you have suggestions, you should yell them out in our chat room at chat, that orange

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:59.520
ready.com because when a host needs an answer, they might consult our chat room and pick

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.520
some of our favorites.

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:01.520
Okay.

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.520
The way to listless works.

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:03.800
I'll recap for you one time.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.560
Four people are going to participate, so it's going to be us and Alan is in the room.

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:08.560
Hi Alan.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.560
How you doing?

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.560
Good.

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:11.560
Yay.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:12.560
Hi.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.560
What's new.

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:14.560
Skyrim.

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.560
Okay.

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.560
All right.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.280
So we're all going to go around and name our top three and then we each go around the room

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.280
and take one off of the list.

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.060
That leaves a list of eight.

01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:27.500
You guys in our chat room, then vote on the list of eight to pick your number one and

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:28.500
number two favorites.

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:33.640
And then we have our definitive list of the top three bullshit rumors that will be next

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.720
about the Wii U Xbox lube or PlayStation four.

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.720
Okay.

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:41.320
All right.

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.320
So let's start it off.

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:47.440
Um, who wants to start off, uh, dark soccer is going to start up dark soccer in the air

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.500
like I was in school.

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:54.780
Your number three bullshit rumor headset will come out that will send a signal directly

01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:58.360
to the brain through a small laser shot toward the optical nerve that will provide an immersive

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:04.080
environment at Andy fork effect, making them easily conquerable by our alien overlords.

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.840
So I'm going to shorten that to say board headset.

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:17.960
This the little thing from the Star Trek episode, the game, ah, what console will that be on?

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.920
It's Nintendo.

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.920
It'll be on the wheel.

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:21.920
All right.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:23.920
That's a Sony thing.

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.920
Okay.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:25.920
Controlling you.

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:26.920
That would be Sony.

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.440
It's always one step closer to the holodeck, right?

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.440
Yes.

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.440
One step closer to the holiday.

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:31.440
All right.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:32.440
How about Loki?

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.440
Why don't you go next?

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.440
Loki?

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.440
What's your number three answer?

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.800
My number three answer will be that the Xbox lube, uh, to further its immersion with gamers

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:44.840
and stuff will fire, uh, different colored liquids at you, depending on the situation.

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:52.240
Black spray, sweat, pain.

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:58.640
So it will actually, it's going to be liquid vision and it will actually fire shit at you

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:01.880
and get your living room.

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:09.100
And when you're playing a sex game, it's iridescent and foamy and shows up really well under a

01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.100
black light.

01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:11.100
All right.

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:12.740
I'll go next.

01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:16.120
My number three answer for next bullshit rumor.

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:22.800
The Xbox lube will introduce a new technology that is 100% hack proof.

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:23.800
Yay.

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:26.480
See what I did there?

01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:27.800
I see what you did there.

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:28.800
All right.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:31.680
So the Xbox lube will be a hundred percent hack proof.

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:38.680
It'd be funnier if it was a hundred percent hack proof by the fact that it's just a solid

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:39.680
steel block.

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:47.040
Like you have to cut through with like welding material, welding tools to get to the actual

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.640
like people, people put it on their entertainment centers and then the entertainment center

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:54.560
just collapses because it can't hold the weight.

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.760
It's like, ah, don't worry about it.

01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.760
It's made out of a mystery material from space.

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:00.760
All right.

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:05.480
So, uh, Alan, what is your number three answer?

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:11.600
Microsoft purchases the mega video brand next Xbox cap streaming Netflix in 72 minutes as

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:15.680
DLC two for XBLA silver.

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.560
How am I supposed to shorten that way?

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.880
They're going to cap Netflix in 72 minutes.

01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:25.520
Are you familiar with watching pirate stuff on mega video after 72 minutes, it would say,

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.800
we're sorry, you're, you know, you've watched too much, so you have to, and it would piss

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800
people off.

01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:39.360
So LOL, if the Xbox did that in some ways, that's funny.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:44.600
That's trolling the pirates because it's like, LOL, you got a free movie and then trolled.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:45.600
You don't get to see the ending.

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:46.600
That's kind of funny.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:49.160
And what was the other half of that?

01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.760
Also on for mega download, you have to enter a queue to actually download the episode you

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.760
want.

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.520
And sometimes it would be up to an hour or more.

01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:00.920
So if you're an Xbox silver member, you'd have to wait to buy to get your DLC.

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.920
All right.

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:02.920
There you go.

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.040
Xbox taking some tips from mega video.

01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:08.760
All right, let's go to Loki for his number two and I'm sorry, dark soccer was first.

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.440
I was going to say, please, I was doing things out of order.

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.440
Dark soccer.

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.440
Your number two answer, please.

01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:17.080
The Wii U will actually have a camera and the controller that maps your face to your

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:22.840
me, but it secretly steals your soul and feeds it to Miyamoto.

01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:27.780
They advertise it as having a webcam in it, but it steals your soul.

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:30.040
Now what will Miyamoto be doing with those souls?

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:38.880
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, using it to fuel his dark magical powers to make a new Zelda

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:39.880
game.

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:40.880
All right.

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:44.800
Loki, your number two, it'll be Zelda soul force.

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.360
Well, I was going to have it be like the Wii U as a VR headset, but that's kind of been

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:50.360
done before.

01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.040
So the Wii U is the controller.

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:54.480
Like the actual console is the controller.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:59.960
So you better make sure you don't throw it because that might be bad.

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:05.800
Wait, I put Wii U as a console as a controller.

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:06.800
Don't throw it.

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:07.800
Here we go.

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:08.800
It's gotta be funnier.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:09.800
All right.

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:10.800
All right, fine.

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:11.800
Okay.

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.640
It's a, it is the controller, but it's shaped like a giant, like number one, you know, foam

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:23.560
glove because they're the number one console.

01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:30.760
I like the idea of a big number one foam glove being the next controller.

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:31.760
All right.

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:34.840
They're trying to, you know, real in the sports lover demographic.

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:36.640
All right.

01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:43.160
My number two answer is that the PlayStation four will actually let you beam yourself into

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.200
the grid so you can participate in Tron.

01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.120
Like IRL reboot and the blind, the show reboot, right?

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.120
Is that what you're talking about?

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.120
That show?

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.120
What was that?

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.120
Incoming game.

01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:57.120
It was a Saturday morning.

01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:58.120
Part two.

01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.800
It was one of the first police ever.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:00.800
They had blue faces.

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:01.800
They were purple.

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:04.800
They were purple.

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.760
Hold on.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:09.760
I'm typing this out.

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:12.440
PS four will actually let you beam yourself in the grid.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.440
Okay.

01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:18.640
I have a friend that's a really big fan of that show too.

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:20.440
How many years has that been off the show?

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:21.440
All right.

01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.880
So Alan, your number two answer for next bullshit rumor.

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:32.480
Taking a hint from the PS two emotion engine, the PS four will have an empathy engine chip

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:41.800
that actually really does feel the same pain as you when it's $799 price point is revealed.

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:42.800
Womp womp.

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:43.800
All right.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.480
So the PS four empathy engine actually will feel sorry for Sony when the price point is

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480
revealed.

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:51.600
I don't like that PS four empathy engine.

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.600
All right.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.600
Dark Sakura.

01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:56.880
It's time for the number one answer is let me, let me recap just so we don't have any

01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:57.880
double heads.

01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:58.880
Let me recap.

01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.120
Headset from the game for PS four.

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.120
I should put Star Trek.

01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:08.640
The game headset from Star Trek, the game for PlayStation four fire different colored

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.640
liquids at you.

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:19.440
What console was that loop of the loop lubricating liquid and fires warming gel in your eye.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.040
All right.

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.520
Xbox lube is a hundred percent hack group.

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.220
Xbox teams up with mega video, which brings caps for Netflix.

01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:30.240
The Wii U will steal your soul and feed the Miyamoto.

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:34.440
We use the console is the controller and it comes with a big number one foam glove.

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:39.440
A PS four will actually let you beam yourself into the grid and the PlayStation four has

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.440
an empathy engine.

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.280
When you hear the $799 price point, it will cry.

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.280
All right.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.280
Dark Sakura.

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:53.240
I'm going to laugh number one answer for next bullshit rumor for the lube.

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:57.000
Everyone will be issued a skin implant that has what games they've purchased registered

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.840
to their DNA.

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:08.400
That would be the only real way and most importantly, hack proof.

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.880
So when you actually go in to give blood samples, they'll be able to see what games you've purchased.

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.360
Ooh, someone's been playing X tango.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.360
Okay.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:18.360
Really?

01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.360
You bought fusion frenzy.

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.280
All right, Loki number one answer.

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:27.480
The PlayStation four will be a co-produced by Capcom.

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:33.040
It will arrive in the shape of the bad box art mega man in the position of where he is

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:40.640
teabagging the consumer as a special thanks from Capcom for your wait, the console or

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:41.640
the box.

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:45.240
The actual console will be in the shape of bad box art mega man.

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:52.080
Think of it as a statue, if you will, uh, where he is teabagging the user PS four co-produced

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:56.120
by Capcom console is shaped as mega man teabag.

01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:58.920
It's the ultimate insult or the ultimate troll.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.920
I see.

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920
I see it.

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:01.920
It's all been leading up to this.

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:02.920
Exactly.

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:03.920
All right.

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:04.920
It's a PlayStation exclusive.

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:08.640
You see my number one answer.

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:18.160
President cat is a launch title for the Wii U as a seller that might sell me the system.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.480
Hey, it could happen.

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:20.480
All right.

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:24.000
Hey, an insider source told me they're thinking about it.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.320
Alan, your number one answer.

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:30.120
My ideas kind of fell apart when it came to number three.

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:32.120
So this kind of really is good.

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:38.040
Um, the second gen three DS XL will also double as and work better than the we use controller

01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:45.640
tablet from launch comes with a free step of coup blade for early adopters.

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:50.760
So basically the next three years will work with the Wii U and actually be better than

01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:55.040
what comes with the new and you can fall on it when you realize how much you paid for

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:56.040
it.

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.040
Yeah.

01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.040
Got it.

01:59:58.040 --> 01:59:59.040
All right.

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.040
All right guys.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.040
Here we go.

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:02.040
Let's see.

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.040
First I got to read off some of the answers from chat here.

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.960
I don't know if I see a tiger class says, how about the Wii U introduces a new peripheral

02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:10.160
to let you control the dashboard or games, but only using your mind.

02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:15.880
Uh, a hum, a hum Kara says Sony and Microsoft secretly joined forces to develop a console

02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:19.160
to beat Nintendo since that's the only way that they could win the console battle in

02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:24.640
Japan and the worldwide, uh, acidic vampire thinks that in dark soccer's answer about

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:28.200
Miyamoto taking the souls, they'll be transferred to the means.

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:29.760
Let's see.

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:36.240
Uh, tiger class says the Xbox introduces a perfect, oh wait, I already saw that one.

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:38.680
Um, so we said something about the only play MMOs.

02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:39.680
There you go.

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:42.120
Some of the answers from our chat room.

02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:43.120
All right.

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.120
But we, we, you want to change yours.

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:46.120
Yeah.

02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.120
Get rid of my third one.

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:49.120
I have a new, I are at my first five, my final one.

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.120
I want to replace it.

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:52.120
Yes.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:58.600
So it's rumored that the load up a splash screen for the Wii U is actually a memory

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:14.000
erasing pulse so that they can get you to buy a budget of Zelda and Mario.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.880
So I have the Wii U loading screen erases your memory.

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.800
So you rebuy games all over again.

02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:19.800
I like that.

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.320
Do I, do I own the super Mario three?

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.320
I can't remember.

02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:24.960
Don't I have Mario three?

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.760
I love Mario three.

02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:27.880
All right.

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.760
Now's the part where we go around and eliminate items from the list.

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.680
It's very difficult, but it has to be done.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:34.000
All right.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.840
Here's the list of stands so far.

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:41.240
Headset from Star Trek, the game for PS4, uh, Xbox lube fire different colored liquids

02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:42.240
at you.

02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.000
Xbox lube is a hundred percent hack proof.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.040
Xbox teams up with mega video caps for Netflix.

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.800
Wii U will steal your soul and feed them to Miyamoto.

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.880
We use the console as a controller and it's just a big number one foam glove.

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:57.160
The PlayStation four will actually let you beam yourself into the grid.

02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.960
PlayStation four has an empathy engine price of $799 fuel pain.

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:06.960
Xbox lube skin implant, which purchases registered to your DNA.

02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:11.040
The PlayStation four is co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as Mega Man teabagging

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:12.040
you.

02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:16.200
Uh, president cat has a launch title for the Wii U and the Wii U loading screen erases

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200
your memory.

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.360
So you rebuy the games again.

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.640
Unfortunately, the list cannot stay in this shape.

02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.120
We have to tinker with it a little bit and erase those that are unworthy.

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.240
Dark Sakura, which of these is unworthy of the list?

02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:32.600
I have to go with the, um, liquid one.

02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.520
Oh, that's just, that's one of my favorites.

02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:38.960
The Xbox lube firing different colored liquids at you.

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:42.080
I would love that one, but it is off the list.

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:43.080
Sorry.

02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:44.160
Chatters low key.

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:45.720
Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:46.720
I take off.

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:49.920
It's a hundred percent hack proof because they will make that claim and unfortunately

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:52.920
it, you know, it's not going to be a hundred percent.

02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:53.920
All right.

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:57.040
That is stricken from the list.

02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:05.120
Um, I'm thinking, sorry, I don't mean to be quiet.

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.720
Um, I'm going to erase.

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:12.880
I'm going to erase.

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:17.320
I'm sorry, Jamie, the headset from Star Trek, the game for the PlayStation four, it went

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:18.320
over my head.

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.320
All right.

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:22.320
It is off the list.

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.960
Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.960
Oh boy.

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:40.840
Um, looking, looking, the, uh, president cats, a launch title for the Wii U.

02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:46.160
I think you just eliminated the one the entire chat would have voted for, but it is off the

02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.160
list.

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.160
What?

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.160
That's probably the second or third time I've done that on this list.

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:55.560
I'm not rid of the popular fandom one, so I'm just keeping up with my shitty reputation.

02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:02.200
All right, Alan keeps his shitty reputation by striking president cat as a launch title

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:05.060
for the Wii U hit is off the list.

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:06.060
So here it is.

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:07.060
Here's the list.

02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:10.840
As you can vote for, please send your number one and your number two answers as a private

02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:15.400
message to sky in the chat room, S K I E sky in the chat room.

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.320
Here is the list as it stands now.

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:20.320
Xbox teams up with mega video and there's caps for Netflix.

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.200
The Wii U will steal your soul and feed it to Miyamoto.

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.180
The Wii U where the console is the controller and it's a big number one foam glove.

02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:31.840
The PS4 will actually let you beam yourself into the grid from Tron PlayStation four empathy

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.760
engine that will feel the pain of a $799 price point.

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.040
Xbox lube has a skin implant with purchases registered to your DNA.

02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:44.560
PlayStation four is co-produced by Capcom and the old school mega man will teabag you.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.660
A Wii U loading screen erases your memory so you rebuy games.

02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:51.240
There is the list as it stands now.

02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:56.360
Place your number one and your number two votes in a private message to sky S K I E

02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:57.620
in the chat with your vote.

02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:00.960
We will tally them up and have the answers for you shortly.

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.960
In the meantime, let's go to more news from Loki.

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:05.960
Thank you, Alan.

02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:07.320
You can stick around for results later.

02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:08.320
Yeah.

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:11.900
Just, just tell chat the reason why I deleted the president cat one is because it was more

02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:14.840
about a game than the console.

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.640
Justify, justify, justify.

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:19.800
All right.

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:20.800
No, it's fine.

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:21.800
All right.

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:22.800
Moving on.

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.680
Uh, there's a rumor that SNK may be releasing a new Neo Geo handheld system.

02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:34.680
Uh, not necessarily a Neo Geo pocket, but it's currently known as the Neo Geo portable

02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:35.680
device.

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:40.720
Um, and it's a handheld it's, they're saying it's slightly bigger than an iPhone.

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:46.800
It comes with two gigs of storage, uh, plenty of buttons, a 4.3 inch screen, SD card slot,

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:48.200
headphone jack, and AV out.

02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:51.640
It sounds just like a dingo to be honest.

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:53.160
Looks just like a dingo.

02:05:53.160 --> 02:06:00.560
Um, and, uh, they're saying, um, thanks to official SNK licensing, it comes preloaded

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:06.520
with 20 Neo Geo titles, um, North American versions, including metal slug, fatal fairy

02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:13.680
specials, and Goku, uh, King of the monsters and a magician Lord, as well as many others.

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:16.160
I have magician Lord already.

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:22.560
And um, let's see, yeah, it sounds neat.

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:31.080
Of course, you know, this is coming from Famicom Plaza and, uh, SNK hasn't really, uh, confirmed

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:35.200
anything yet, but, uh, it looks neat.

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:42.720
We want interesting, as long as the games are cheaper, that's the most important thing.

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:43.720
Oh yeah.

02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:44.720
All right.

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:48.080
Moving on with some other, uh, little Nintendo updates going on.

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:53.880
Uh, Nintendo has apparently, um, I guess they're, they're really experiencing some heavy losses

02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:57.840
and it's even funny because the story's so much out there that that one, what is that

02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:01.380
Asian company that does all the animations that end up on like Conan O'Brien and stuff

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:02.380
of the news NME?

02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:03.380
Is that their name?

02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:05.360
I can't remember NMA or something.

02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:06.360
Yeah.

02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:10.040
Um, they actually did a video on this whole, like Nintendo's losing money thing, but the

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:14.560
interesting kind of silver lining to this is that apparently 15 million 3DS units have

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.720
been sold since the launch.

02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:19.800
So 3DS has really recovered in many ways, which I seem to remember saying on this show

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:25.160
would happen around Christmas, but anyway, um, here's the thing though, uh, Nintendo

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:31.440
did basically switch their forecast around from a $20 billion profit to an actual loss.

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:36.760
Hey, Nintendo had sales of 7.2 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal year.

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.760
And that was a 31% decrease.

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:42.960
And their overall loss was 48.4 billion yen.

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:48.600
That's $620 million, um, quote Nintendo 3DS hardware during the nine months ended December

02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:52.020
31st, 2011 were 11.4, 3 million units.

02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:55.780
And the total worldwide sales since its launch exceeded 15 million units.

02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:59.960
That's in the official press release from the company, uh, Mario 3D land and Mario Kart

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.560
7 are million selling titles.

02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:05.040
I want to say I've heard they're up to like 5 million actually at this point.

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:10.960
So, um, apparently some of these financial woes are making people think maybe they should

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.440
get into more mobile gaming.

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:17.120
There's that whole talk again, maybe Nintendo should put something out on iOS, but I highly

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.800
doubt that will ever happen.

02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:22.140
Their stock by the way, is currently at a five year low.

02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:26.320
So they have a lot riding on them for this E3, in my opinion, um, they're going to have

02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.580
to impress.

02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:33.320
If they don't impress, impress at this year's E3, it's going to be very bad.

02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:34.320
Very bad.

02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:39.920
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura is going to open up the email bag and read some emails

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:44.560
for us.

02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:48.760
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and Dark Sakura

02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:53.880
dives into the email bag and reads some of those emails here on air.

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:58.660
I would be able to read them if they would actually go to the email because my computer

02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.240
has decided to be a bitch.

02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:03.240
Okay, there we go.

02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:04.960
This is from blade three.

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.640
I was interested in your setup a couple of weeks ago because I have a couple of handheld

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.160
dynamics that are studio grade that I would like to donate to the show.

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:18.600
I don't have any spare XLR cables unfortunately, but I believe you are likely already using

02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.600
them.

02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:22.200
So if you guys could contact me back, whatever, we can work it out.

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:23.200
Thanks guys.

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:24.200
Fantastic work.

02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.200
PS.

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:26.200
My grammar sucks lol.

02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:27.200
Raffle party limafo.

02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:28.200
Heart.

02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:31.160
You don't give everyone a hard time.

02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:32.160
Heck yeah.

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:33.160
I'll take donations.

02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:34.680
We could actually, actually we do need one mic right now.

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:36.560
We could, and actually we could really use two.

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:38.240
So um, heck yeah.

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:39.840
And we have plenty of cables.

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:43.560
Um, so yes, I should have responded to that offline.

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:44.560
Sorry.

02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:47.240
I should have taken that out of the mailbag, but yes, we want it.

02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:48.960
Now everybody knows our business.

02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:56.240
Well, we first had, um, an email from Rubba Bubba that said, um, I looked around for sites

02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:58.040
blacking out today, January 18th.

02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.640
I'm very disappointed.

02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:03.120
Sites, um, that could bring a lot more force to the event are not participating.

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:06.720
Google censored their own logo, but I think being blacked out would be more effective.

02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:10.360
The only one of my favorite sites that is down is game politics.

02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:13.720
Your site was also down when I checked, but something tells me that wasn't on purpose.

02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:14.720
Yes it was.

02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:17.240
Now we took it down on purpose.

02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:18.320
There should have been a message there.

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:19.320
Now there's a PS.

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.320
Okay.

02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.320
Sorry.

02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:24.600
Almost immediately after writing the email below, senators and reps are dropping their

02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.640
support from SOPA and PIPA.

02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:31.600
Even the sponsors of the bills, the MPAA, then responded in the most ironic way, accusing

02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.300
sites like Reddit and Wikipedia of trying to make Congress into their corporate puppets

02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:38.560
to further their financial empire.

02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.600
That is ironic and stupid.

02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:43.800
Also the Google protest seems to have caught some attention for linking their censorship

02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.560
logo directly to a petition with a very cool infographic.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.520
My own opinion is that piracy is already wrong and we have the legal system in place to address

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:53.080
that via due process.

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:58.320
Well, look what happened to that mega video, although, you know, it did take a while, but

02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:03.080
that guy's, you know, and a lot of his people are in jail now and not getting out anytime

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.080
soon.

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.860
By the way, did you know, did you know that that same guy was like the number one call

02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:09.520
of duty modern warfare three player like in the world?

02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:10.520
He cheated.

02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:11.520
Did he?

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:12.520
Yeah.

02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:13.520
How'd he do it?

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:15.720
Uh, there's ways.

02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:16.720
You don't want to share.

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:17.720
Okay.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.720
No, I just, I don't play quality tomorrow.

02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.720
Warfare three.

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:25.440
I mean, if it's, I'm assuming it's very much like, uh, uh, you know, the other ones.

02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:30.360
It is ironic though that he's getting more time in jail than some rapists and killers,

02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:34.080
but you know, welcome to America.

02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:38.600
Apparently he used to play like quake and stuff like that and rude rage quit and stuff.

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:41.160
And I don't know, whatever.

02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.160
I don't know.

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.760
I can't really speak for, you know, playing him, so I don't know.

02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:48.280
Well, we have one last email.

02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:56.760
Oh, and by the way, people who, uh, um, sent me the, uh, master system things, I am, I've

02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.560
got two of you already and I'm going to be sending those out.

02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:00.560
Just let you know.

02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:01.560
Haven't forgotten.

02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:03.560
Um, I just have to get paid.

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:08.040
Hey, OLR crew, happy new year and congratulations on the move to the new studio.

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:12.160
The show sounds great and it's good to hear Alan is a regular contributor now, although

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:15.880
I have to express my endless, oops, sorry.

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:19.760
The Twitter music started playing my endless sorrow at the retirement of Shermy.

02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:21.440
Shermy is not sorrowful.

02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:27.200
She has her own room that smells like her butt, except I cleaned.

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.200
It's also the laundry room.

02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:29.200
I cleaned it.

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:30.200
But you know what?

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.200
She's happy.

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.120
That room gets warm every time we dry the clothes.

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:40.240
Sometimes a warm towel gets dropped on her as a blanket and she's a very happy girl for

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.240
happy girl.

02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:42.240
Well, keep in mind guys.

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:43.240
I love Shermy too.

02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:44.680
You have to remember, I love Shermy too.

02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:48.720
She's a great cat, but we, we do have kitties in the new OLR studio.

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:50.840
It's just that they're not as friendly.

02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.560
Well, they're, they're pretty friendly, but they're just, they're, they're shy.

02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.560
So they run out of the room.

02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:00.360
They don't want to be in here cause they, they hide, they don't recognize Loki and they

02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:03.240
should recognize our soccer, but for whatever reason they pretend they don't and they run

02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:04.240
out of the room.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:05.800
So, but here's the thing.

02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:11.520
If you're my 3DS friend, I send out pictures of the cats in 3D all the time on swap note.

02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:17.200
So just ask Tiger Claw or Jason if he's listening tonight or Shane I think is in chat.

02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:20.920
A few of you are on my Facebook and I put pictures up on Facebook.

02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:21.920
Yeah.

02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:25.520
Especially Marco walking around with that tail in the air.

02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.520
Look at me.

02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.520
My tail's in the air.

02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.520
Look at my butt.

02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.520
I love Marco.

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:31.520
Such a sweetie.

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:35.680
Sanrio is very, very, she's, she's a cute little old lady, but she gives me the stink

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:36.680
eye sometimes.

02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:37.680
Yeah.

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:38.680
Cause you're another girl.

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:39.680
I know.

02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:45.720
So I have two disparate top topics I was hoping that Rob, Jamie and Loki could weigh in on.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:46.720
No.

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:49.080
The first being the announcement of Resident Evil 6.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:51.040
Are any of you excited by this news?

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.040
Not really.

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:54.900
Um, I don't play the Resident Evil series, so no.

02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:56.140
I got out of this.

02:13:56.140 --> 02:14:01.280
I got out of the series some time ago, although I did dabble in Resident Evil 4, which was

02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:02.280
pretty darn good.

02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:04.740
And I really should have committed more time to the game.

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:11.840
And then Resident Evil 5 was like, from what I hear, Resident Evil 6 is a little more like

02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.040
four than it was like five, which is probably a very good thing.

02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:22.480
So I'm, what I want to know is why does the logo look like a chick blowing a giraffe?

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:25.000
Have you looked at the logo?

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.200
Wait, let me, let me put it here in chat here.

02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.600
Well, while you do that, I'm going to finish reading the part of the email.

02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:32.960
Are you excited by the news?

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:38.080
I am personally having a bit of a fan-gasm, seeing them bring back Leon, Ashley, and Hunnigan,

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:43.780
as I am a huge Resident Evil 4 fan, but have been playing all the games since day one.

02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:45.880
It does kind of look like giraffe.

02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:46.880
See?

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.880
It's just blowing!

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:50.520
It's a chick blowing a giraffe!

02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:51.520
Cannot unsee.

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:53.320
Yes, now you won't be able to unsee it.

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.320
There it is.

02:14:55.320 --> 02:15:00.120
Oh, Jeffrey, what have you gotten yourself into?

02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.920
That's what happened to the Toys R Us mascot.

02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:02.920
I haven't seen him in forever.

02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:07.280
I'm glad he found work on Resident Evil porn.

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.880
Speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.

02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:14.200
And by the way, the last one that I actually played was, uh, that I really actually last

02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:16.960
played was Gun Survivor.

02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:19.920
The one that was like Code Veronica, Gun Survivor 2.

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.920
Oh, okay.

02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:21.920
In the arcade.

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:24.240
That was the last one I actually played myself.

02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:26.960
So speaking of Resident Evil, this leads me to my second question.

02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:29.400
Have any of you downloaded the Revelations demo for 3DS?

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:30.800
No, because I don't have one.

02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:32.800
Why yes, I have.

02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:34.240
Would you like to play a Dark Sakura?

02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.240
It's right there.

02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:37.000
I have 28 uses left.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Maybe in a bit.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000
All right.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.900
I was particularly impressed by the graphical potential the 3DS is beginning to show.

02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:46.760
With the Vita coming out next month and games for dedicated portable systems trending toward

02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:52.760
console level graphics, do any of you feel that at some point the two will intersect?

02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:56.780
Well, haven't handheld's always kind of felt like they're just a generation behind.

02:15:56.780 --> 02:15:57.780
I mean look at the DS.

02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:00.480
The DS is a lot like a Nintendo 64.

02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:03.400
Like the 1DS was a bunch of ports in Nintendo 64 stuff.

02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:05.880
The Game Boy Advance was a bunch of ports and Super Nintendo stuff.

02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:06.880
The original Game Boy.

02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:22.060
And I kind of like just having it kind of with the Great

02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:26.380
Gameboy especially the color had a lot of NES stuff on it so they're always

02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:32.300
kind of you know just a generation behind so I I think I don't know about

02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:35.380
the Vita so much I wouldn't say that the Vita is gonna have the potential to play

02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:40.500
like PlayStation 3 stuff although it's supposed to be PlayStation 3 quality

02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:43.740
graphics yeah because it because a smaller resolution so yeah that's kind

02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:46.980
of what I'm talking out here is that because of the smaller resolution you

02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:51.940
know your TV when you say 1080p that's 1080 pixels right but the amount that's

02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:57.040
on the Vita is less so you can still render high-definition images but just a

02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:02.460
lower resolution because it's a smaller picture so he's gonna look really good

02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:06.900
but I especially don't know about direct ports I'm more excited about this whole

02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:10.140
thing we were talking about earlier with the whole Vita possibly connecting to

02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:15.820
your ps3 if you know with with be it hacks or whatever all I'm waiting for is

02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:20.980
Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Vita so well there's a little bit more I wonder if at

02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:24.700
some point one market might cannibalize the other while I'm personally thrilled

02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:29.620
by the prospect of having ps3 slash 360 quality games on the go it seems only

02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:33.340
logical to assume that at some point these systems will function as portable

02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:37.220
consoles right oh that was really the point he was getting out with that okay

02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:41.020
I get it now why not just wirelessly stream the content from the portable

02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:44.980
system to the TV in your living room if you want a console style experience and

02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:49.260
slip it into your pocket when you don't I understand that the Wii U is trying to

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:52.600
walk the fine line between those two entities but it honestly seems like a

02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:57.260
letdown if the remote only works when you were in Wi-Fi range your thoughts

02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:02.460
okay I get it so okay the rest email really kind of fills that in so the iPad

02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:10.020
too what about it it does just that you can stream content from the iPad to your

02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:14.820
Apple TV to your TV I get what he's saying though is that if if the power of

02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:19.540
what is taking up all the space in my living room is in my pocket then why do

02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:24.260
I need a console but keep in mind that's why console developers are kind of start

02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:26.820
I think console developers kind of see this too and I think that's why you're

02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:31.940
starting to see things that won't fit in your pocket like connect you know all

02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:35.860
these streaming devices that you know will go to your home theater sound

02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:39.380
system and so forth and these systems becoming more of like entertainment hubs

02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:45.700
but I don't know like for me I don't like playing handheld games all the time

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:51.100
sometimes I want that gigantic you know 34 inch or however big our TV is picture

02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:55.100
you know like I would want to play a game like Final Fantasy 13 2 on my

02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:59.580
little DS in bed you know I want to maybe sometimes it would be cool like

02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:02.180
once in a while for the mundane stuff but the big cutscenes and things like

02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:07.940
that I want to see on the hi-def TV you know I don't know I I don't know if one's

02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:11.340
necessarily gonna cannibalize the other but it's a very interesting point that

02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:16.060
you're making and it's kind of neat that now the the consoles are kind of doing

02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:21.220
things that the the TVs are having a hard time like 3d the TVs haven't all

02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:25.180
been able to adopt that across the board yet now here we have the 3ds so it's

02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:28.300
interesting um a lot of ports then you're gonna continue to see a lot of

02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:32.260
ports like the same stuff coming out on the ps3 you're gonna see on the Vita and

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:39.820
the 3ds be interesting yes to conclude yes your loyal olr fanboy tonic vision

02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:45.380
who I would love to commend on fantastic grammar and spelling gold star emailer

02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:51.460
of the week yep you win the no prize I kai judo in our chat room says my

02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:54.780
thoughts is this person plays way too many video games why would you want to

02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:59.740
walk around with a PlayStation 3 well I seem to hey I have a nomad didn't do

02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:03.620
well that and didn't they used to have that little like tiny screen that you

02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:07.580
could plug into the back of a PlayStation one yes make it like it was

02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:11.580
an actual thing play it in the car yeah I see you like play in the car and and

02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:18.280
didn't somebody in this room make one for an Xbox yeah that had Xbox blew up

02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:24.860
by the way like literally put pow yes well it's sort of Wow less less lesser

02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:28.540
extent I was trying to I was trying to take it because that Xbox case is

02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:32.540
falling apart and so I was trying to put it in the traditional case and the drive

02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:35.740
that was in there where the motherboard that was in there there's something

02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:42.500
wrong with the power supplies or something and hooked up pop and blew

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:48.500
something so yeah whatever for the record I have a nomad and I have a turbo

02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:54.500
Express which with a TV tuner you could hook up your turbo Express to the to the

02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:58.220
TV and then you could just take the turbo Express with you and with your

02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:02.420
Hugh hearts I really like this comment from bocce kawa and chat and I think

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:05.860
this really gives you something to think about on the topics let me read it again

02:21:05.860 --> 02:21:09.860
from bocce kawa at chat orange on twitter.com handheld games are different

02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:14.380
to me if I were to pull out Street Fighter on break at work I wouldn't stop

02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:20.380
but playing Pokemon at work is quick and easy that's a very interesting point is

02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:23.860
think about the types of games that are being made on these systems what is

02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:26.780
easier to play on the go and I think I was mentioning this before it might have

02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:29.620
been on Bobby show we were doing the call at the end of the Bobby Black Wolf

02:21:29.620 --> 02:21:33.500
show as we do every week but I was talking about how tiny tower makes a

02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:37.020
great iOS game because you can play it for 30 seconds or whatever and then

02:21:37.020 --> 02:21:42.140
you're done like it would be a terrible game to play on PlayStation 3 or

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:45.860
something like that like it just kind of works on iOS and a lot of the stuff that

02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:49.940
they kind of try to force on iOS like ports of games like Mega Man 2 or the

02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:53.980
Capcom arcade where you can play Street Fighter 2 on the iPhone that's it's it

02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:57.820
sucks you can't control it the touch screen thing doesn't work it's it's

02:21:57.820 --> 02:22:03.820
terrible so sometimes it is designing about really the right game to go with

02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:12.460
the system very interesting all right is that it for emails tonight that would be

02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:18.700
it no more emails sad face all right well I think it's about time for the F

02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:23.660
use of the week this is the part of the show where we get angsty

02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:47.700
if you to the day I've had and not having a tablet

02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:53.060
Loki fuck you for the FBI going after mega upload because I actually did have

02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:57.780
files they use on there and I also had a paid subscription thankfully wasn't that

02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:03.700
long okay it's description but it's annoying because I lost a lot of my

02:23:03.700 --> 02:23:10.100
files that's more piracy related at all so yeah that sucks and besides yeah

02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:13.300
taking out mega upload really that stopped all the piracy it's all gone

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:19.140
there's not like file sharing sites everywhere else oh yeah you lot of good

02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:23.620
job a lot of those file share sites block the u.s. which I thought was

02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:28.220
interesting yeah that's I can get you can get around that shit I'm sure you

02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:35.460
can't same way you do it in China all right um my F you the week I don't know

02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:41.700

definitive list these are the rumors that are coming next on the or they're

02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:08.540
not not true number three answer for the next bullshit rumor about the Wii U the

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:13.820
Xbox lube or the PlayStation 4 number three answer the PlayStation 4 is

02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:18.380
co-produced by Capcom and the console is shaped as a Mega Man teabagging you

02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:26.420
excellent the number two answer the Wii U will steal your soul and beat it to

02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:34.140
Miyamoto yeah and lastly the number one answer the thing this is it is the next

02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:40.420
rumor and it's a thing the Wii U where the console is the controller because

02:24:40.420 --> 02:24:46.380
it's a big number one foamy glove there it is how appropriate that number one is

02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:51.820
number one ah Alan the chatters rejected both your and I answers all the way

02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:56.540
because I ruin their fun I pick what they like and then I get rid of it

02:24:56.540 --> 02:25:01.900
everybody it's Alan the destroyer of dreams I swear I don't do it on purpose

02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:05.540
it's usually after the fact I'm like oh shit but then it's like I don't give a

02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:08.620
fuck either so well since you're here is there anything you want to plug real

02:25:08.620 --> 02:25:14.860
quick not really anything you've been playing you want a shout out Skyrim more

02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:21.980
Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim yes and I cheat I cheat for gold and I'm not sorry did you

02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:31.100
take an arrow to the knee yes get out all right all right there it is your

02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:34.140
list list for tonight just a few more news stories for you guys and then the

02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:38.620
Twitter topics and your calls at one eight seven seven game olr not just yet

02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:43.100
we have some more stories for you guys Loki let's talk a little bit about

02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:47.860
Resident Evil 6 again other than the fact that the logo sort of looks like

02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:57.360
giraffe lacio giraffe lacio it rolls off the tongue is that censored on Xbox

02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:05.700
giraffe lacio anyways so apparently it's the largest scale game ever made for

02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:13.100
Capcom it has 600 people involved and should be pretty expensive by that you

02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:18.020
know but it sounds like that apparently to put the numbers in the perspective

02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:26.980
Assassin's Creed 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 were completed by 450 people and well

02:26:26.980 --> 02:26:33.220
450 for Assassin's Creed 2 1000 for Grand Theft Auto 4 so be pretty

02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:40.140
significant of course it can also be very buggy who knows you ever heard this

02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:46.740
phrase too many cooks in the kitchen mm-hmm I want to know how on earth that

02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:51.460
Resident Evil box art got out it's like nobody looked at the work that the

02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:57.740
designer did the designer screwed it all up I was trying to get a reaction I'm

02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:02.940
not getting anything she's just not paying attention to me I'm sorry what I

02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:08.060
said for Resident Evil resolutions I'm surprised that that got out no well I'm

02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:11.020
talking about the box art for isn't even you said resident evil in my brain just

02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:15.660
went easy Resident Evil revelations that box art went out with a misspelling and

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:19.260
I was surprised how that happened and got out I said the designer didn't check

02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:24.220
their work is all the designers fault and the design no blame no I'll tell you

02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:29.620
what happened okay well yeah first of all the designer made a typo the

02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:35.380
designer should have caught that but also QA should have caught that

02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:41.140
marketing should have caught that distribution should have caught that

02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:48.940
the end anyhow sorry I didn't mean to derail from Resident Evil 6 but I'm

02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:55.820
sure it'll be great even if the logo looks like your a fella show hey steam

02:27:55.820 --> 02:28:01.820
has a new iOS client it's in beta right now but I found that it's actually

02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:05.660
pretty easy well I don't know maybe I'm just lucky but I tried to log into the

02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:09.060
steam iOS app and it said sorry you're not in the beta and I'm like well boo

02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:12.740
you whore and I shut it off but then the next day I was like well I wonder if I'm

02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:16.060
in the beta yet I don't have an email but I'm just gonna try it anyway and

02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:21.060
sure enough it let me right in so I'm able to get into the steam beta app and

02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:24.900
here's what it basically lets you do is is basically sorry you're not gonna be

02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:28.900
able to like suddenly play Arkham City on your iPhone it doesn't do that okay

02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:32.060
you don't actually get to play the games but it's a front end for the store you

02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:35.060
can see the stores you can see the sales you could actually of course they want

02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:38.300
you to be able to spend your money right there from the you know wallet there's

02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:42.180
buy some games but here's something else that's interesting is that you can use

02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:47.220
the chat from steam from your phone and I actually was doing that a little bit

02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:51.340
like I was on my phone in the other room and I started sending messages to Alan

02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:55.620
while he was playing Skyrim I was like lol ghost I'm not there to be doing this

02:28:55.620 --> 02:28:59.340
and so he figured out that I must have got into the iOS app but the chat

02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:02.420
functionality is pretty cool at least so and you can see what your friends are

02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:05.420
playing and I guess you can still look at things like screenshots and videos

02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:08.820
all on the go so the good news about that is is that like if you have this

02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:14.420
awesome Skyrim bug that you got a video of you could get out your iPhone you

02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:17.580
know and say hey look at what happened to me in Skyrim dude and play it and

02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:21.660
then you know it's right there so that's kind of cool I bet it's a matter of time

02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:24.580
before maybe we start seeing some games so I don't know if it'll be like the

02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:30.340
same games you see on but well I guess maybe that can't happen because Apple's

02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:33.140
got to have control over all that and they're not gonna exactly let steam just

02:29:33.140 --> 02:29:37.580
waltz right in and do that so I guess that is kind of a dumb train of thought

02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:43.660
I'm going down but regardless it is neat that the chat is all integrated and you

02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:48.180
know what they can kind of tie together is and who knows what might come in the

02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:53.860
future who knows all right and dark soccer is trying to get into the app

02:29:53.860 --> 02:29:57.580
right yeah maybe I should check and see if they let me in yet you never know

02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:05.820
all right moving on dark soccer me oh yeah that's right me how about pixel

02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:12.460
junk Eden guess where it's gonna be sting as in Thursday this week February

02:30:12.460 --> 02:30:20.700
2nd we will have pixel jump Eden come from coming to a PC on Steam so you can

02:30:26.260 --> 02:30:34.220
soundtrack separately for six whole dollars ooh six dollars that's a bargain

02:30:34.220 --> 02:30:38.860
at half the price I'll wait for the it is a bargain at half the price I'll wait

02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:44.100
for the fourth of July sale when it's gonna be 75 cents I know right no pixel

02:30:44.100 --> 02:30:47.860
junk are pretty good games so you know and six dollars which I found one of the

02:30:47.860 --> 02:30:53.940
pixel junk games for PSP at RC Willie for five bucks what is RC Willie it's

02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:59.140
like a big lot no it's a huge expensive furniture store and they have

02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:02.220
electronics except they're owned by Mormon so they're closed on Sunday

02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:06.700
that's weird well not the Mormon part but the part about the whole like PSP

02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:11.620
games got weird all right a couple more news stories for you guys and then the

02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:18.580
skype line Loki all right and see the last thing we're gonna talk about here

02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:26.340
well last thing I want to talk about is I can online passes and especially it's

02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:30.300
not so bad that you know you have like an online pass for a game that has

02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:35.300
online content but to call it an online pass for a game that does not have

02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:39.620
online content is kind of idiotic but that's what they did with kingdoms of

02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:45.300
Amalur reckoning they have an online pass for the game that will basically

02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:52.020
unlock this house of valor faction quest line which they came out afterwards

02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:55.540
because everyone's going well you know what the fuck you know why I have to I

02:31:55.540 --> 02:32:00.300
could actually you know buy this game knew they have you know the actual quest

02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:03.940
line for the game you know doesn't make any sense they're saying that you know

02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:10.260
we always wanted to put this game or this content out as free bonus content

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:15.140
like free download content that would come later on or something like that but

02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:18.860
now it's being you know part of the only past and they were defending that you

02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:23.500
know well you know we need to do this because you know fit you generates more

02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:27.220
sales and blah blah anyways I don't know I just stopped paying attention when

02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:33.020
they're calling it online pass for a non online game what they really should have

02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:42.620
done is just put out you know put bonus DLC with your you know first run games I

02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:45.940
mean that's honestly would just be a different way of phrasing the same thing

02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:49.740
it'd be yes and people will not get pissed off they'd be like you get this

02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:53.460
bonus I mean no one's gonna complain oh hey guess what you know what we're

02:32:53.460 --> 02:32:58.220
gonna give the people that buy the new game our first content pack of DLC for

02:32:58.220 --> 02:33:02.900
free everyone to be like fuck yeah that's awesome thank you for rewarding

02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:06.500
you know people for buying it new but then you're saying you know instead that

02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:11.340
oh it's just you know it's an online you're making people feel like you're

02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:14.220
giving him something as opposed to taking something away exactly that's

02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:23.020
what it is yeah but all boils down to yeah so and in 38 studios your community

02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:32.580
manager muse needs a fucking learn what you never never ever ever fucking say

02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:37.380
that the content was once on the disc even if it was on the disc you never

02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:41.500
fucking admit to that because then it is that this is that the same guy that's

02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:44.660
like the guy behind it who was like a big baseball player back in the day well

02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:47.940
Kurt Schilling is actually the head of the company 38 studio and isn't he the

02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:51.980
same guy that's posting online no this is their community manager okay but yeah

02:33:51.980 --> 02:33:56.820
he posted online some follow-up to but no he said you know so we wanted to post

02:33:56.820 --> 02:34:00.300
a quick clarification for something that we've seen a few comments on for what

02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:06.060
it's worth the House of Valor content was not in the finished game disc at one

02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:09.900
point and then removed okay so it sounded like before that it was part of

02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:13.420
the finished game this but it's not that they're saying that it isn't it's

02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:16.980
nothing that we're locking you out of it was supposed to be standalone download

02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:20.620
content okay well that's great so it was the situation where it's gonna be free

02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:23.460
download content later on but don't fucking call an online pass because it

02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:28.540
still implies that you're taking some away I mean I understand that EA calls

02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:33.940
their passes online passes but just call it like a voucher for free DLC cuz it's

02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:37.700
people won't get as pissed off about that I've heard the demos pretty

02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:42.140
dreadful like just because it's so buggy and like they've actually apologized to

02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:46.460
the demo and all this and it's kind of like dude why would you I mean I I'm so

02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:51.260
shocked that companies allow this to happen like how did that happen if if

02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:55.420
people up at the top are so upset and like I can't believe that we put out a

02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:59.460
product like that like oh my god why would I be give you give you $60 of my

02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:04.260
money to trust that I'm gonna get a good time this is what I've you know said

02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:08.940
about download passes and stuff like that even though you're not getting this

02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:13.700
extra quest line who gives a fuck I mean seriously we're talking like a bonus

02:35:13.700 --> 02:35:19.380
quest DLC thing that you may or if it was you free yeah you probably downloaded

02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:22.500
if it was paid if you don't like the game you're probably not gonna buy it

02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:28.060
and I don't think you know something like this you should really pay $60 for

02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:32.040
a way I mean it sounded like a cool game you know the character artworks done by

02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:38.140
you know Tom McFarland which you know that's pretty awesome but it's just I

02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:40.840
heard some positive things about it though some people say it's it is the

02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:45.620
game that everybody thought fable would be yeah I mean it looks cool and and I

02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:49.240
hate to see like games that kind of try something a little bit different you

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:53.100
know sorry was it supposed to be like multiplayer MMO at some point I don't

02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:55.540
think so I thought it was like there was supposed to be some type of like

02:35:55.540 --> 02:36:02.260
multi-person element in it that went away but I mean I don't know don't let

02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:07.660
it the fact that you know this online passes in there because I'd say for like

02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:10.780
a game like battlefield or something like that where you can't access online

02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:16.180
portion you know demoing it out used without paying for the online pass that

02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:19.500
is kind of crippling because you can miss a whole portion of the game that

02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:24.700
it's kind of integral I mean people play battlefield 3 for their the online

02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:29.300
portion of it but but oh you know if you don't buy those new copies and the

02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:38.020
servers don't run yeah that makes no sense but I don't know it's whatever it

02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:44.260
is what it is buy it or don't all right lastly for you guys tonight I don't know

02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:47.980
as a resident here the state of California this this just pisses me off

02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:52.020
but California has agreed that they're gonna reimburse the Entertainment

02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:56.580
Software Association just shy of 1 million dollars that's nine hundred and

02:36:56.580 --> 02:37:02.380
fifty thousand dollars in legal fees for bright fighting Brown versus the EMA up

02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:07.940
to the Supreme Court let's see that the state negotiated that down from the

02:37:07.940 --> 02:37:13.900
1.1 million Wow now there was already reimbursements previously for the case

02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:19.660
in 2008 this means that California has paid out in total 1.3 million dollars to

02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:25.780
the ESA yeah they're raising our tuition it and I quote Senator Yee and Governor

02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:29.300
Schwarzenegger wasted more than 1 million dollars in taxpayer funds at a

02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:33.900
time when Californians could ill afford it says Mike Gallagher who is the

02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:37.740
president of the ESA however we feel strongly that some of these funds should

02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:41.220
be used to improve services for California's youth so the ESA is just

02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:46.220
kind of like rubbing it in basically now the ESA did say they will donate a

02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:49.940
portion of the proceeds from the reimbursement to quote develop

02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:54.500
after-school educational programs for under underserved communities in Oakland

02:37:54.500 --> 02:38:00.460
and Sacramento hey our backyard this new education initiative will be start in

02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:04.420
the spring and quote harness young people's natural passion for playing and

02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:08.700
making video games and connecting them to the development of critical 21st

02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:13.140
century job skills well while that's all nice and good that the ESA is pouring

02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:18.620
some of that money back into you know the community I'm a realist and I know

02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:21.880
certainly not all of it is going back into the community and that's my fucking

02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:26.940
tax dollars like that just went to the ESA which if I remember right is now an

02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:29.800
organization that was supporting SOPA and PIPA and all this stuff and it's

02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:33.460
like I don't want my money they're going to draw me for this stuff okay fair

02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:39.140
enough they did withdraw but I still feel like in some indirect way I paid to

02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:43.420
help lobby for SOPA and PIPA for a short time and that kind of irritates me you

02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:48.860
know I'm just I'm I I'm really irritated and I and Senator Yee will not kind of

02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:53.180
give up this fight and I feel like he needs to be removed from office by vote

02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:56.380
now sadly I don't live in a place that gets to vote for him or against him but

02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:02.620
I mean sorry he needs to go he wasted that money and so did the governor but

02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:09.060
the governor's already gone thank God that was just a joke I look I realize

02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:12.460
they're not a political show and people get very very passionate and personal

02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:17.140
about political stuff but I just governor Schwarzenegger was absolutely

02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:22.280
terrible for the state I'm sorry he was he was so bad so so bad and if you need

02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:26.160
proof here's one of many examples how taxpayer dollars were just fucking

02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:31.340
wasted and now it's like the state is fucking broke businesses are leaving

02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:34.820
this state they want to talk about upping taxes they're upping education I

02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:41.380
mean like you know what's gonna oh you know what's gonna ultimately and oh you

02:39:41.380 --> 02:39:44.620
know what's gonna ultimately end Orange Lounge radio I'm gonna tell you you

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:48.080
know what's gonna ultimately end this show one of us is gonna leave California

02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:51.300
because we can't afford to be here anymore in our career it was almost that

02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:55.860
it was literally almost that yep Dan wanted us to up and move to Washington

02:39:55.860 --> 02:40:07.460
and I begged I was seriously in a really bad way over over that potential I can't

02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:12.300
do it so I mean you well I won't do it you barely dodged a bullet and you know

02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:16.900
you never know if heaven forbid myself Loki or something lost our job and could

02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:20.280
only find something somewhere else you know that'll be what ends the show

02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:23.860
because California couldn't fucking keep the business here because it's stuff

02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:29.020
like this well I mean on top of that they're they're turning students away

02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:33.860
now when that's your source of tuition right there you know for at the CS at

02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:38.900
the CS level and they've raised the tuition so much yet they won't you know

02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:43.000
let more students come in and put some of that money into building larger

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.260
facilities and hiring more teachers it's just absolutely ridiculous you know you

02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:53.700
know what I'm paying right now in junior college is just under what I was paying

02:40:53.700 --> 02:41:03.700
for my four-year school in 95 I'm paying $36 unit hour and I was paying about 42

02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:10.540
at the University of South Alabama it's ridiculous no so I know a lot of folks

02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:16.540
go Oh California is all sunshiny and all this stuff but it's it's can sometimes

02:41:16.540 --> 02:41:23.220
be a little bit sad there you go sorry I didn't mean to be Debbie downer but

02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:27.740
that's that's where we live and that's an important story to talk about please

02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:31.740
do not let senator you get it reelected he fucked up he won that he would not

02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:35.060
let this go he would not let it go and I think he has to pay the price for it

02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:40.860
that's that's my my thought let's take calls 1 877 game olr or a username on

02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:44.420
skype is orange lounge radio that's all one word the skype line is open and we

people and we might have scared everybody off so let's see if there's

02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:56.940
any tweets whoop whoop whoop whoop that's my wacky morning DJ noise here's

02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:01.260
let's talk let's do a story about pot that'll make everybody feel better at

02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:06.060
least a lot more relaxed make me throw up Tiger Claw has sent us a link to a

02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:09.980
story on Kotaku that says hey you might want to get rid of those pictures of you

02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:14.500
smoking weed before you unload your Nintendo 3ds and you can imagine where

02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:20.580
this story goes somebody bought an Xbox off a Craigslist or GameStop or whatever

02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:25.260
what is this um well was from the UK where this happened where somebody

02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:31.700
inherited a used 3ds and on the 3ds was a picture of a dude smoking a bong which

02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:36.540
I believe is as illegal in the UK as it is here meaning technically it's illegal

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:41.700
but you know most people won't do anything about it but still I mean

02:42:41.700 --> 02:42:47.820
fucking if you're gonna sell you system back delete your pictures geez hi you're

02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:51.260
an orange launch radio who's this hey it's the one and only Bronva hey I

02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:54.740
haven't heard from you in a while what's up not too much I've been around here

02:42:54.740 --> 02:43:03.180
and there you know oh I bet you get around what's up um something

02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:08.660
interesting that happened to me and Jill video yesterday do tell we played dance

02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:13.660
central for the very first time it took you this long I don't have a

02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:18.860
connect and my sister who had a housewarming she has a connect in a three

02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:23.460
and the 360 after she put her daughter down and the drinking kind of went a

02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:28.780
little crazy she suggested a rock band let's do dance central souls like so it

02:43:28.780 --> 02:43:34.500
was all like why the fuck not why the fuck not so you you played DDR and dance

02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:39.980
games for many years what did you think of dance central I the main reason why

02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:44.420
I never played dance central so I thought I would make a fool of myself

02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:53.860
still did just it was just as funny but I noticed that to me one song and dance

02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:58.900
central is equal to maybe in my normal two or three song dance set and DDR

02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:04.100
because when I was done I felt like I was going to collapse well to be fair I

02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:07.220
believe the songs are a little bit longer I don't know if they're like

02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:10.700
they're not full length of the song but I want to say as opposed to like a

02:44:10.700 --> 02:44:14.180
minute and a half it's more like two minutes I think it kind of feels like it

02:44:14.180 --> 02:44:17.580
is the full-length song though yeah I mean they get enough of the song in

02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:23.900
there that works for me so what what would you think of the songs that were

02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:29.300
available I was tripping out when I saw the song list I was like are you

02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:35.320
serious mm-hmm have you played did you get to play the sequel dance central to

02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:39.880
it all yes yes cuz um we it was sitting there my sister didn't finish that one

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:44.540
so we was all like you know we might as well help her and um popped it in first

02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:51.780
song I did with sandstorm Oh Lordy I was like Oh many a con many a con did you

02:44:51.780 --> 02:44:57.900
get to see the dance for born this way I I believe somebody did do born this way

02:44:57.900 --> 02:45:05.180
it was um it was pretty uh feminine wasn't it yes but what's enough alcohol

02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:09.820
it's all good it's all good everything's all good with alcohol that's for sure

02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:16.540
so did playing dance central make you go maybe I want to get a connect after all

02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:21.980
actually kind of yeah and then we were all talking about like how come cannot

02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:25.260
we doesn't do give us power power paradise and I was like well it kind of

02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:30.020
gave his dance masters you know what's funny uh I'm glad you brought this up

02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:34.340
because I forgot to mention it somewhere else it was on now keys Facebook no no

02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:39.540
or you mentioned it as part of the UK releases the rhythm party oh I just

02:45:39.540 --> 02:45:42.260
totally missed it cuz I was focused on something else yeah rhythm party is a

02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:46.940
game by Konami it's all the people that did dance masters on Xbox Live arcade

02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:51.860
and it's uh it's some like I saw the song list now if you had the song list

02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:56.660
up but it's seriously like a bunch of Konami originals and then born this way

02:45:56.660 --> 02:46:01.540
by Lady Gaga like they finally licensed like a big song and one other one too

02:46:01.540 --> 02:46:05.620

topics pretty much all right let's try to do one more quick one okay this is a

02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:10.900
quick one this turned into like a giant 100 post third on my friends Facebook

02:49:10.900 --> 02:49:16.140
there was a discussion about this do you believe that using a strategy guide is

02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:24.900
cheating in a game my personal opinion it's not it's not cheating but there's

02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:30.420
certainly a reward to some people for being able to do it without it I think

02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:35.820
for some people it's more rewarding to do it without it but not everybody gets

02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:39.140
that same sense of satisfaction like I definitely used to be one of those

02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:43.260
people it's like scuff I don't need a stinkin strategy guide to get through

02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:47.660
this game don't insult my intelligence but now I'm like yeah whatever get out

02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:53.420
get out the iPhone let's let's pull a game facts and do that I found it hmm

02:49:53.420 --> 02:50:00.100
does row is one of the many aliases of Osama me me get era along with D crew

02:50:00.100 --> 02:50:05.980
positive MA and MTO does Q represents a collaboration of him and Taku well

02:50:05.980 --> 02:50:10.660
Osama is known by his trademark hard rock sound and hard-hitting beats the

02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:14.060
songs have appeared in Papa music beat mania beat mania TDX guitar frix

02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:19.500
germania and dance dance revolution sorry there you go and just you know

02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:23.420
stand in our chat room also says using a strategy guide isn't cheating I don't

02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:27.900
think so I don't think so look at all these RPG games and I look at them like

02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:31.940
I let me get the strategy guy I cuz I know I'm going to need it and now look

02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:36.020
at AC strategy guys they don't really spoil anything it's just like a guy to

02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:39.900
tell you how to get through to various levels and half the time if you're

02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:44.260
starting to look at as a reference I will say this some strategy guides have

02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:49.140
cheats in them mm-hmm so only you know if you looked at that page or not

02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:53.100
usually like way in the back there might be some codes to help you cheat so it's

02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:56.180
it's only up to you but here's my here's the other thing I would have come back

02:50:56.180 --> 02:51:00.540
to your friend with is that if it's a single-player game who cares who cares

02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:04.820
if it's a single-player game cheat all you want you're the one that chooses I

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:08.460
had to spend your $60 you know if you want to get there the hard way and get

02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:12.580
those rewards then yay but if you want to just you know cheat your way through

02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:16.460
it and get the all the video in it or whatever then yay you know whatever you

02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:20.420
need to do mm-hmm it's in MMOs but then of course they have strategy guides for

02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:24.100
MMOs but I don't consider like I don't consider a Warcraft strategy guide

02:51:24.100 --> 02:51:29.380
cheating they bundle it in the deluxe edition would allow that if it was

02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:34.020
cheating it's not cheating it's just maps and shit you know and tips yeah

02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:39.380
because I said this and I walked away using a strategy guide or game guide is

02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:44.960
not cheating well you hacked the game that's when you're cheating I agree with

02:51:44.960 --> 02:51:47.620
that and I think we'll leave it at that Rama thanks so much for your call tonight

02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:57.060
hey no problem take care buddy you to stay fabulous I will 1877 game olr or a

disappointed in you tweeters we will read one more from Tigerclaw though

02:52:13.740 --> 02:52:18.140
Tigerclaw is always you can always count on you can always count on certain

02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:22.300
things in life you can count on taxes you can count on getting ripped off from

02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:26.220
vending machines and you can count on Tigerclaw posting two stories for the

02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:32.580
olr Twitter every night every Sunday I have Korea is considering a move that

02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:37.100
would block miners from playing online games for over three hours something

02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:40.740
Tiger call linked us from gamasutra the South Korea Ministry of Education

02:52:40.740 --> 02:52:44.820
Science and Technology is reviewing a policy that would ban miners accounts if

02:52:44.820 --> 02:52:49.940
they play games for more than two hours consecutively or a total of three hours

02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:54.180
in a day what would you think of that what do you think about banning kids

02:52:54.180 --> 02:53:02.220
straight up from playing games we're buying you wasn't Ragnarok online that's

02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:05.260
a Korean company by the way just you know there already is a law that

02:53:05.260 --> 02:53:10.140
prevents children under 18 from playing online games during the late nights but

02:53:10.140 --> 02:53:13.660
this would be something else kind of new trying to read through some of these

02:53:13.660 --> 02:53:18.340
quotes here if the game industry is really a troublemaker then the related

02:53:18.340 --> 02:53:21.660
government should discuss it and provide guidelines to instruct us that was from

02:53:21.660 --> 02:53:26.940
a game industry representative who's trying to fight this interesting all

02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:29.060
right let's go to the phones take another call hi you're on orange launch

02:53:29.060 --> 02:53:34.380
radio who's this look at Zaku here hey Zaku how you doing pretty good actually

02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:39.600
just uh resting up right now getting ready for tomorrow's a gruellish work

02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:45.980
week tomorrow is a Monday yeah case of the Mondays yeah all right anyways no

02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:51.380
you know aside from like having not like calling in a while been busy building

02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:57.180
new new PC getting battlefield 3 up and running and just spending most of my

02:53:57.180 --> 02:54:03.020
time on that sorry I've been busy having pink eye like a three-year-old wonder if

02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:06.140
you can still spread it over the Internet's probably not let's not find

02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:11.500
out but yeah I guess aside from like playing Battlefield 3 I kind of noticed

02:54:11.500 --> 02:54:15.900
that this whole spat on like you know having to include online passes in games

02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:20.380
and the fact that Kurt Schilling's video game company is like still trying to do

02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:26.060
damage control of what were how how they ended up describing it it's like it

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:29.300
brings up a fundamental shift in the fact that this wasn't the case like

02:54:29.300 --> 02:54:34.300
several years ago even like in the previous generation like Japan was like

02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:38.620
the only country that really had had it out for used games to the point where if

02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:42.180
I recall correctly a Supreme Court decision over there paved the way for

02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:48.380
for retailers actually sell used games like this wasn't like I know it was like

02:54:48.380 --> 02:54:52.660
illegal to sell like used games like you know in the early days of video gaming

02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:56.220
over there I'm actually with you I remember that I do remember something

02:54:56.220 --> 02:54:59.900
like that not here in the US but over there yes I do remember that and so I

02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:05.100
guess for some reason or another due to other factors beyond their control I

02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:10.260
guess because of like bad economic times and the fact that most gamers are are

02:55:10.260 --> 02:55:14.020
starting to become a lot more casual like we're seeing a lot more casuals and

02:55:14.020 --> 02:55:19.820
then hardcores to be honest so it really doesn't justify you know having a

02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:25.860
demographic that will constantly buy it on day one you know I myself I mean I

02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:31.260
try not to buy you know I try to buy it new but if for some reason there there's

02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:36.060
no compelling reason whatsoever to get it that quickly I may just opt for a

02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:39.900
used copy like most of the other games I bought you know most of them are just

02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:43.540
like used the second-hands except for the ones that I bought new like a four

02:55:43.540 --> 02:55:46.860
is a four that was definitely worth you know buying just because of the the

02:55:46.860 --> 02:55:50.660
value added the fact that it was something that you know they they

02:55:50.660 --> 02:55:54.300
offered up not only just an impressive card list but just like some really good

02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:59.540
deal see it off the bat well but then you also get like really mediocre games

02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:04.100
in which the only way they can really try to draw in people is to try to offer

02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:10.780
DLC they'll they'll make up for for a lackluster game then you also have like

02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:15.060
a recent example of that and I I know I I'm thinking there's something is this

02:56:15.060 --> 02:56:19.220
game my mind where DLC kind of helped add stuff in a game that was kind of

02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:24.820
lackluster trying to think right now no it can't be Mortal Kombat that game the

02:56:24.820 --> 02:56:28.900
game was pretty good on the online pass but it's like the whole notion of trying

02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:33.700
to trying to stifle another industry like you know GameStop I guess that

02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:37.900
that's where they're I guess my point is like they really I guess in the next

02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:42.220
generation we won't we probably won't see GameStop I give it like another five

02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:46.700
years before they're like calling it quits because they because once

02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:50.780
technology gets better to the point where where Microsoft could actually pull

02:56:50.780 --> 02:56:55.660
off a system that detects use game copies then you know to the point where

02:56:55.660 --> 02:57:02.380
it may not be you know may not it may not be like a viable to even like sell

02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:06.580
any of those new copy you know any of those copies anymore that's assuming

02:57:06.580 --> 02:57:10.460
the system is successful and I kind of think I think the consumer base at large

02:57:10.460 --> 02:57:14.740
will reject a system with those types of restrictions in place then again it

02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:18.940
unless of course those restrictions are like you can't play use copies at all

02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:23.340
which would be suicide for for that manufacturer anyway but something that

02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:27.580
basically instead of having a paper printout of a of an online passcode

02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:32.380
something that gets activated for that particular account you know like if you

02:57:32.380 --> 02:57:38.340
you you run the disk once and you need you need like a like an account I guess

02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:42.980
like a gold account or something on an Xbox Live where it would detect that you

02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:47.460
already ran this particular copy of the game and you get that online pass so any

02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:50.940
other person running that game afterwards for a different account will

02:57:50.940 --> 02:57:55.780
have to pay so something like that which is which takes a sting out of a

02:57:55.780 --> 02:58:00.180
draconian system that would just prevent use games from playing at all well and

02:58:00.180 --> 02:58:04.380
it's also insulting when I pay $60 for the game and I'm paying this premium you

02:58:04.380 --> 02:58:09.900
know I get with 99 cent or dollar 99 games you know that's a digital license

02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:13.220
or whatever but like you know with $60 I want my physical copy that I could take

02:58:13.220 --> 02:58:16.640
to a friend's house this is ridiculous you know at some point the consumers are

02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:21.220
going to say no to that so I I think that whole thing was a load of bullshit

02:58:21.220 --> 02:58:25.180
I understand but it has to be at a point where it gets really bad right now it

02:58:25.180 --> 02:58:29.260
really isn't because you know what most gamers don't really care they'll just

02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:32.940
they'll just know that if the game is like really good and it's and it has

02:58:32.940 --> 02:58:37.140
good reviews and it's getting a lot of buzz that they'll line up outside of

02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:42.100
GameStop or Best Buy to get it day one. So why was the PSP Go not successful?

02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:47.420
Well I guess it's it's it's a factors in in the sense that it was all digital

02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:52.700
like people want and you're right you do bring up a point of having to wanting to

02:58:52.700 --> 02:58:57.460
own your you know the games that you buy and I kind of have to go through the

02:58:57.460 --> 02:59:01.980
same thing with Steam in that all the PC games that I that currently own are all

02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:06.820
digital so you know but I know. I know very sorry sorry to interrupt but I know

02:59:06.820 --> 02:59:11.100
very few people that spend like $50 to get games on Steam there are some

02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:15.940
there's some. I only buy on the sale or unless I really need to have that copy. Everybody buys Steam stuff on the sale

02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:19.140
because it's dirt cheap and so you don't mind that you're not having a physical

02:59:19.140 --> 02:59:24.260
copy because but there are certain times where I did buy the game for price like

02:59:24.260 --> 02:59:27.540
there were certain times where I actually like how to like suck it up and

02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:32.700
buy those games full price. I bought one. I bought Civilization 5 at full price

02:59:32.700 --> 02:59:37.220
that's it. Like right now I'm gonna have to buy Skyrim full price because you

02:59:37.220 --> 02:59:42.100
know what the sale wasn't like it was it was not low enough in the sense that I

02:59:42.100 --> 02:59:45.260
could probably pick it up cheap later on but if I wanted to play it right now

02:59:45.260 --> 02:59:48.740
would have to suck it up same thing with Battlefield 3 I bought that full price

02:59:48.740 --> 02:59:53.460
it was Origin but nevertheless I bought it I didn't I didn't wait for it to go

02:59:53.460 --> 02:59:57.380
on sale I wanted to play that now and I still haven't bought the the expansion

02:59:57.380 --> 03:00:01.660
bag yet. I just want to point out you don't have to shop around a little bit

03:00:01.660 --> 03:00:06.060
because Steam is charging $59.99 still I think but I looked at Amazon for $47.46.

03:00:06.060 --> 03:00:09.420
Well that's the thing that Battlefield 3 is only on Origin anything other than

03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:14.540
Steam remember that whole spat where EA wanted to like you know because of what

03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:19.780
Valve set up in their terms that they took most of their games away out of Steam

03:00:19.780 --> 03:00:25.220
and into Origin. Why get a digital copy then? Well because it sucks having you

03:00:25.220 --> 03:00:28.660
know it doesn't make a difference if it's activated through Origin because

03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:33.140
that's that's where all EA games are going you know at this rate so even if I

03:00:33.140 --> 03:00:38.640
have a digital copy only be tied to my Origin account just like Steam. Alright I

03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:43.380
gotta wrap up and let you go buddy but we'll hope that gaming manufacturers get

03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:47.420
the right idea what we really want. Alright yeah definitely have a good one.

03:00:47.420 --> 03:00:50.740
Alright you too buddy. Alright that's gonna do it for the Sky Flying tonight.

03:00:50.740 --> 03:00:54.100
We're running a little bit over tonight so we're gonna wrap it up and get on out

03:00:54.100 --> 03:00:58.220
of here but first I want to go around see if there's any last-minute stories

03:00:58.220 --> 03:01:04.800
Dark Sakura or Loki? Meh. Nothing I really wanted to talk about. No? I know like

03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:08.180
Dark Souls you wanted me to mention there was some gaming chair so not even really

03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:12.380
gaming chair but like some PC pod chair thing that you know that someone's

03:01:12.380 --> 03:01:17.060
trying to sell it it's really expensive and sort of looks like you know some

03:01:17.060 --> 03:01:21.940
immersion rig from you know Ready Player One or something but uh oh yeah yeah I

03:01:21.940 --> 03:01:25.620
saw that you know I was expensive you know and there was another story that he

03:01:25.620 --> 03:01:29.060
posted that was interesting about the whole like world record somebody spent

03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:33.300
like 40 hours trying to beat some DDR record and got denied by Guinness but it

03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:36.700
was a little bit too busy of a Newsweek to fit something like that in especially

03:01:36.700 --> 03:01:42.220
you know DDR's. I saw one that was also I was it Jimmy Kimmel or not Jimmy Kimmel

03:01:42.220 --> 03:01:49.660
uh Jimmy Fallon did some really stupid record a while back where most consoles

03:01:49.660 --> 03:01:52.940
played in a minute you know something like that were like I don't even know

03:01:52.940 --> 03:01:57.060
how you arbitrarily do that because it's like press a press a press a press it's

03:01:57.060 --> 03:01:59.820
not even they have to do something for a second I don't even know what the

03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:04.180
requirements like WarioWare in real life. It's stupid but then someone else

03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:08.180
apparently beat their record or they claim to beat the record with 13 consoles

03:02:08.180 --> 03:02:14.460
played I don't know it's dumb I mean that's you can't have a record on that

03:02:14.460 --> 03:02:19.380
because there's what are you gonna say that you it can constitutes playing just

03:02:19.380 --> 03:02:27.220
like pushing pause and I mean pushing a I don't know we have had 16 consoles on

03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:32.340
in my house before well you need to do WarioWare IRL where you just run

03:02:32.340 --> 03:02:36.440
around all those you know and do do something for a second on each one do

03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:41.220
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo all right we're gonna go around wrap up the

03:02:41.220 --> 03:02:46.300
show and get everybody's final thoughts so where do we start Dark Sakura thank
