14315	26458	Tonight, January 15, 2012, Kid Icarus Uprising will come with a bundled accessory, a new PC gaming tablet as shown at CES, and can Apple iOS gaming actually save your life?
31997	32317	DarkSakura.com
54472	61757	She unexpectedly had something come up where she is in San Francisco tonight doing some friend stuff, so she's not here.
62217	70022	So sadly, she will not be joining us tonight, but we always like an excuse to say hello to Salacious Pop, who's filling in tonight.
70303	71423	As always, as usual.
71603	78748	Who's kind of become the Joan Rivers of our show, the always fill-in host when Johnny Carson was gone.
78808	81470	That reference is way too old for any of our listeners.
81850	85272	If I tried to hide in the office while you were recording, I'd just get knock, knock, knock.
85652	87633	The show only has two people tonight.
87893	88773	You have to help.
89754	92195	Do you really want this show to be a complete failure?
92315	92615	Actually, no.
92695	95977	Loki and I have done a show alone before, but it's more fun with three.
95997	96937	It was fantastic.
97257	98018	Three's a crowd.
98338	99058	Oh, yes, there he is.
99118	101079	Tech Master Loki is here tonight.
101659	102059	I'm here.
102239	103020	How are you doing, Loki?
103280	106822	Thankfully, Alan came to the rescue with barbecue sauce because McDonald's...
108582	111323	If the sauces have green covers, they must be the same, right?
111703	115244	Because habanero is just exactly the same as sweet and sour sauce.
117925	125688	And of course, always joining us, our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at all games radio, www.
127028	128109	Allgames.com
141616	148121	Let's see, and going to our live chat room, who's always with us, Tigerclaw starts us off saying, oh, tonight's show is a sausage fest?
148581	162992	I guess, if you want to look at it that way, but we will have chatter, comments, and I know there's some lovely ladies that chat with the show, and then of course Twitter, and hopefully phone calls later, so, you know, it'll be ladies night on the Skype line, hopefully, we'll get some women to call in, but you know what?
164093	165894	No matter what your gender is, we're all gamers.
165934	166975	That's what it's about here.
167175	171118	Video games, the gamer lifestyle, and the show where every gamer has a voice.
172519	176801	Tonight, before we get into our gaming weeks, we usually do a little bit of topics at the start of the show.
178142	179823	We're up against the Golden Globes tonight.
179863	183906	It seems like having a show on a Sunday, we're always up against some stupid award show.
183966	184606	Oh, that's tonight?
184807	185867	I totally didn't even realize.
185887	186548	I didn't know either.
187088	188529	Yes, the Golden Globes is tonight.
188609	190930	Honestly, guys, are you really going to watch this show?
190950	193131	Just read it tomorrow like everybody else.
193291	194591	I will say this.
194651	199153	The whole Ricky Jervis thing where he's a total asshole.
199954	201394	It's funny.
201474	203235	He just says what everybody's thinking.
203355	207317	That part will be cool, but I know that all the good zingers will be in the news tomorrow.
207337	208037	Is he hosting, I'm assuming?
208117	208938	Oh, yeah.
208958	209658	Remember that whole thing?
209838	211259	He's not going to come back to host.
211279	214220	He was disrespectful, and he did not represent our point of view.
214640	216804	and it's like, oh shit, people love it when he trolls.
216984	219268	Oh shit, highest fucking ratings in like 10 years.
219308	224376	Dude, seriously, if you want your show to have great ratings, just fucking get Neil Patrick Harris to host it, okay?
224416	225457	He can host anything.
225477	226799	Well, that's the Tonys, but yeah.
227440	229544	I don't care, he can host anything and he's awesome.
231426	235550	I will tie this into gaming, I promise.
236771	240614	Over the weekend, Alan and I have a New Year's resolution this year, actually.
241495	247260	Or I should say, Alan has a New Year's resolution that I've been, and we use this term at work, voluntold.
248703	251346	That's where you didn't volunteer for it, you got voluntold.
251386	254730	So I got voluntold for this New Year's resolution, but I liked it, so I went along with it.
255111	256132	So what is the New Year's resolution?
256192	263501	It's something I've done in 07 or 08 that worked really well, and it's to just see one movie in theaters a month, regardless of what's out.
264402	265363	One movie a month in theaters.
265703	265884	Yep.
266404	266605	So...
267225	270166	and that's good because last year we saw like two movies the entire year.
270186	275489	We saw Tangled and Black Swan and those were both done by February and we didn't see a whole other movie until a year later.
275509	280571	I got my movie for February already but I haven't gotten the chance I'm definitely going to go see it or sneak out to see it.
280591	282351	Wait, are you doing the one movie a month thing too?
282652	284813	No, but there's a movie in February I want to see.
284853	285273	What is that?
286053	286834	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
305752	308217	I swear I have never heard of that ever.
308377	309178	I'll find you a trailer.
309239	310000	It's really cool looking.
310020	310661	Okay, interesting.
310741	316612	No, I think our February movie we already decided is going to be the borrower's Miyazaki version.
316952	318355	Yeah, the Studio Ghibli.
318595	318896	Ghibli.
319284	320124	Beauty and the Beast 3D
345269	368342	with all the football games this weekend yeah but you know come on it's Disney and you know how I feel about Disney and Beauty and the Beast really is one of the better you know Disney movies they did kind of part of that whole 90s renaissance so they did the whole 3D thing and we took our friend Victoria who I think was on the show a long time ago none of you guys probably remember her but we all went and for three of us it cost $51 to see Beauty and the Beast 3D
369704	370444	Was the 3D worth it?
398783	398983	DarkSakura,
419261	425945	But, oh my gosh, there's like this rush of 3D movies coming out this year that are all just fucking 2D conversions.
426005	427626	Okay, I remember the name of the movie now.
427746	428187	Chronicle.
429407	430028	I haven't heard of it.
430908	434411	I guess I'm just... This is why we need to see more movies.
434431	437933	We can do an awesome bit of radio here and I can show you the trailer.
439014	440615	This is what happens when Dark Sakura is not here.
440655	443276	When it becomes a sausage fest, we can't stay on the topic of games.
443376	444277	Now it's the movie show.
444597	457107	Okay, well, I was happy the fact, because, I mean, I don't know if you read, they were talking about doing a live-action Akira, you know, it was going to be terrible, because it was going to be in the United States, and just made no sense whatsoever.
457167	459589	But this actually looks pretty cool.
460069	461671	And let's see here.
461791	467956	Okay, well, before I get to that, let's see, Shesaro in our chatroom says, $51, fuck that shit.
468296	470758	I would require to see some of Belle's Disney titties.
473060	473120	No.
473459	474479	There were no titties.
474540	475560	It's a Disney movie.
475620	476140	Come on.
476881	480482	Am I really going to watch this live on air?
480522	481683	Am I really derailing this show?
482023	486045	Because you know I was trying to turn this all into a 3D games chat, but hold on here.
487185	488326	Let's go back in and look.
490467	491628	Alright, I'm looking at this trailer.
491768	492588	This is a two minute trailer.
492608	493208	I can't watch all this.
493228	494189	It's going to derail the show too much.
494309	495349	We'll just watch part of it.
505356	507697	So what, is this all shot like Blair Witch Project style?
508097	519442	Not exactly, because they... The guy that's doing this is using some common sense, figuring out, you know, in this day and age, people know how to operate a camera.
521282	521763	Oh, I see.
521783	525244	So it's more like people with their own iPhones.
525684	527885	Whoa, that was like a Furoda moment there, right there.
534457	538739	So they're making a teddy bear dance with telekinetic powers and freaking out a little girl.
539679	540940	Now they're moving a car with their mind.
540960	543941	Maybe fast forward it a little bit.
543961	548424	Okay, so it's a movie about bros that get magneto powers, basically, right?
548904	549244	This looks...
557435	557836	Whatever.
558737	559217	Alright, sure.
559237	559818	I think it looks cool.
559998	560278	Whatever.
560418	560779	Whatever.
561239	562561	I'll get it on Netflix if nothing else.
562881	574714	Alright, what I want to... Okay, so yes, my point was, before I got so rudely derailed, they're converting all of this 2D stuff into 3D because there were how many previews before we saw Beauty and the Beast?
574754	576155	Like, eleventy billion, right?
576175	576356	Yeah.
576696	579399	And it's Finding Nemo, back in theaters.
579779	582460	Star Wars Episode 1 back in theaters.
582560	583420	Finding Nemo.
583440	584921	Titanic back in theaters.
584941	586041	Okay, Titanic is stupid.
586101	589242	But Finding Nemo makes sense because it's all CG.
589322	591363	Just re-render for two points of view.
591683	593424	And the 3D will probably be pretty good on that.
593584	593764	Yeah.
594604	596705	Finding Nemo, I'll give a little bit of a pass.
596745	598445	But I'm not paying $51 to see it again.
598465	598745	I'm sorry.
598785	599526	It'll be on Blu-ray.
599766	601046	I could buy the Blu-ray for half that.
601086	601546	You know what I mean?
601726	601967	Yeah.
602207	603227	So I'm kind of â€“
603800	608384	TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says it's Cloverfield but with super powered teens.
620254	620694	I don't know.
637535	637735	Yeah.
638295	639116	Do you agree, Alan?
639216	639496	I do.
639756	643517	It was just kind of like, it looked like it was kind of post-production stuff.
643557	649320	I mean, and I can't imagine how terrible the ones from the 70s are going to look with the whole post-3D.
649920	655262	So, I mean, I guess cool that it's back in theaters for those that want to see it in 2D, but ugh.
656343	660404	Anyway, my point was, now we're getting into more 3D games, right?
660504	662425	And like 3D is kind of where gaming is going.
662785	664326	And my thought is, inevitably...
665186	669911	Inevitably, there's going to be a point where we're going to start seeing games re-released in 3D.
670332	679221	Wait for it, because we had the Halo Anniversary Edition this year, which was the high-definition remake of classic games.
679321	680602	That's where the industry is right now.
680802	681183	We get all these...
681423	682824	High Definition Remakes.
682964	685406	There's a little bit of clarification though there.
685726	690249	There's some HD remakes that are kind of cool where they take the game, remake it in a whole new engine.
690269	691029	It's all new assets.
691049	691570	That's fine.
691590	692290	A new art department.
692330	699695	Or the Final Fantasy X, which despite how you may or may not feel about Final Fantasy X in the series, the fact that they've come out and said they are remaking it.
699795	700596	It is not an uprest.
700636	700816	Okay.
701076	715489	Now, like stuff, for example, the Metal Gear Solid collection or the, like even the God of War stuff is not really a new, I mean, mainly the Metal Gear Solid stuff because that looked really blurry and kind of weird.
716070	723397	Or there's that Silent Hill one coming out in March that's really weird because it's kind of just up-rezzing but they had to do all new voice acting because of the
723777	726959	Legal Troubles that one of the guys in the prior voice cast did.
726979	727780	Silent Hill is dead.
727920	733843	I mean, seriously, that series, I can guarantee the new game's going to be terrible.
733983	737325	I mean, it's not what it used to be.
737986	743369	They try and they try, and they try to figure out what people want, and it's just, they get it wrong every time.
744130	748772	GameGuru in our chatroom says, RadRacer, I almost said RidgeRacer, RidgeRacer.
749593	752355	I'm sure that'll be in 3D at some point too, but he's saying RadRacer 3D?
753131	753931	3D World Runner 3D World Runner
775925	778326	Not red, blue, but they do like the other type of glasses.
778366	780768	They have that available, and they also have actual 3D.
781028	781208	Yeah.
781908	790213	But yeah, it's the... But although, that technique is supposed to be to the point where the colors don't get all messed up from it.
790914	803901	I don't know if that's true or not, but apparently the glasses, I haven't actually used them, are supposed to preserve the colors so that even though it is the green and kind of magenta, it's still okay.
803921	804001	Yeah.
804261	808144	So how long do you guys think before 3D remakes become a big craze?
808384	811626	And let's not forget, this is already happening.
811726	815149	If you doubt what we're saying, remember what was the big thing on the 3DS last year?
815389	819552	Zelda 3D was like the only thing on that console worth having for a while.
820052	822274	And of course there was the Star Fox remake as well.
822334	823855	So they're already starting.
823995	828058	But they're not even really necessarily putting that game in the 3D.
828098	830019	It's just, once again, it's a new camera.
831440	836344	I don't think they're going to be that popular because people don't really care about 3D on consoles right now.
854319	857741	They have it there so they can kind of say, hey, look, we support 3D and stuff.
857761	862184	But it's not mainstream yet to where everybody has 3D TVs and everything.
862204	866968	Because even the 3D TVs, I mean, the content out there is not very good so far.
868329	870590	So I don't think it's going to be a major trend.
870810	873892	You will see a ton more HD collections, though.
874132	878055	Everything is going to be fucking taken and put into HD, if you will.
878495	883839	Yeah, but especially when we get into the next series of consoles, is 3D inevitable?
884525	886786	Like, is 3D gaming really the future?
888306	893868	Eventually, but I don't think it's going to be something that they... I don't know, they may release a bunch of stuff for it.
894329	894669	Why not?
896549	897830	Alan, you look like you're dying to comment.
899662	918043	I think that it should be available with the next generation of consoles but if they just say this is it like telling the consumers what they want rather than just seeing what the consumers want themselves I don't care about 3D games because you've got the TV and the glasses and all that horse shit it's like stop it
918263	925947	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Kaijudo says, I have a 3D video convert and I watched the Star Wars movies in 3D.
926327	928468	Episode 3 looked good with all the crazy colors.
928508	930669	You mean those Blu-rays are already in 3D?
931029	935171	I mean, the other thing about Beauty and the Beast, that shit's been on 3D Blu-ray since November.
935711	938293	And when I found that out, I was like, oh, well that was...
939434	945721	You know that some HDTVs already, the 3D HDTVs, will convert 2D stuff into 3D.
945781	946502	Oh my gosh.
947223	948665	But a lot of it sucks.
949686	952249	Alpha Canandagram says they did smooth the heck out of Zelda 3D.
953066	957709	Well, they better, I mean, it's gonna be on a, it'd look like shit if they didn't do something to it.
957989	964433	Stuff on the N64 was so fucking ugly, I don't care how nostalgic you are for the game, it was an ugly system, the games on it look like shit.
964634	975821	It doesn't matter though, I mean, that system's old, and that system was meant for, you know, standard definition TVs, and of course you have the scan lines and everything, so, you would better do something to it, because it'll look like crap.
977439	985946	Let's see, Kaijudo in our chatroom says, they make way too many bucks in the video industry to really care about Alpha Cananogram 3D.
986207	987368	I don't know why he said it that way.
987508	990110	I think Alpha Cananogram must have made another comment earlier.
990510	995274	But I was thinking, wait a minute, I don't know if the video games industry is necessarily doing that well.
995314	998757	I mean, I know we've heard about the movie industry was in a little bit of a slump this last year.
999558	1005343	Of course, there wasn't a lot of great, great movies outside of, you know, like what the Harry Potter and, you know, a couple other things here and there.
1006223	1007384	that people really wanted to see.
1007465	1015071	But video games, I seem to recall reading a story this week that December did not treat the gaming industry very well, especially if your name was Nintendo Wii.
1015211	1016232	Nintendo Wii, specifically.
1016272	1021956	I guess 3DS obviously has made a huge rebound, but Nintendo Wii, as we all figured would happen.
1022037	1023918	What is there on the Wii right now?
1024218	1026840	There was no title for it this Christmas, and they paid for it.
1026941	1030383	Well, here's the... No, they had Fortune Street, to be fair.
1030544	1031344	They had Fortune Street.
1031364	1034227	Like I said, they had no title on it this... I mean...
1035827	1039988	It came out two weeks after Zelda, so what do you need?
1040148	1041869	Oh, that's right, they had Skyward Sword.
1041909	1043049	Now I sound like an idiot.
1044429	1046930	I forgot they had Skyward Sword.
1047390	1055252	But for real, it got lost amongst the Skyrim, the Saints Row, it was a huge year this year.
1055692	1056633	Well, here's the thing, too.
1056833	1057834	One game wasn't enough.
1057974	1058995	I gotta tell you, here's the thing.
1059615	1062058	The Wii, not a lot of stuff coming out for it.
1062358	1070905	I mean, yeah, they've announced Mario Party 7 and Rhythm Heaven Fever, but those are the Nintendo first party stuff.
1070945	1073648	Third party, there is not much for the Wii right now.
1073708	1077991	There's a bunch of games that have been delayed forever that are just still floating around.
1078512	1082175	But, I mean, if you look at the release list as far as Wii titles are concerned...
1083598	1084138	Thanks for watching!
1104492	1108373	PlayStation 2 stuff anymore, but they did one last year.
1108413	1114416	And actually, they did an original Xbox in 2010, even though that system had been done for a while.
1115136	1117257	And the PSP is going the same way too.
1117317	1125199	So the PSP is going to drop off the face of the earth this year, and obviously PlayStation 2 already is, but I think the Wii is going to drop pretty fast.
1125459	1127780	It's going to be gone by the time the Wii U comes out.
1128561	1128961	Or at least...
1130021	1134104	I mean, they may be putting out a couple things, but it's going to go kind of the way the PlayStation 2 is right now.
1134124	1137185	It's going to be like Disney Channel games and, you know, just kiddie stuff.
1137205	1138666	Well, not even necessarily that.
1138726	1141268	It's like really, really small third parties.
1141708	1148312	And that's all that really have, like, yeah, like Kokum, Oxygen Games, you know, Crave.
1148993	1151014	They have a few games coming out.
1151954	1156117	But they're, I mean, I don't know when they're coming out because they keep getting delayed and delayed and delayed.
1156137	1156957	Yeah.
1158358	1176274	but it's not anything really mainstream although like I said Nintendo does have Mario Party 7 which is kind of like eh and Rhythm Heaven Fever which I know some people are looking forward to but it's not anything like a mainstream appeal Mario Party will have a mainstream appeal but Rhythm Heaven most people could skip that
1178041	1183303	Alright, as if I didn't look like a big enough idiot forgetting about Zelda, I have a little correction to make here.
1183763	1188665	Shane's listening and he's a huge Silent Hill fan and linked me to this thing that's on the Silent Hill Facebook.
1188706	1194528	Apparently, the original voices will still be in the Silent Hill collection for Silent Hill 2.
1194628	1199250	And you're going to be able to switch back and forth between original voices and new voices.
1199710	1202531	But Silent Hill 3 will only have the new voices.
1202691	1203772	But they will be, I mean...
1204532	1208575	In my opinion, 2 was the better game, but I know 3 has its huge fans.
1208795	1209616	3 was a great game, too.
1210596	1220963	And they say in their official little release here on Facebook, quote, Unfortunately, due to factors both technical and logistical, Silent Hill 3 will be presented with new voices only.
1221863	1223104	Yeah, technical and logistical.
1223364	1223745	And legal.
1223765	1224385	Cha-ching!
1224525	1224865	Money!
1226787	1227307	But there you go.
1228608	1228888	All right.
1229626	1231789	Anyhow, enough talk about 3D and all that stuff.
1231829	1232470	Let's move on.
1232510	1236074	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the stuff that we have been playing this week.
1236574	1239498	Usually DarkSakura starts us off, so I'll let SalaciousPop go.
1241031	1242332	I'm sorry, Alan.
1243013	1245935	I keep forgetting you go by your name now and not an online name.
1246015	1248177	Well, it's just too wordy to say over the air.
1248357	1248718	Fair enough.
1249338	1259006	The two big games I'm playing right now, aside from WoW, and I am playing a little bit more WoW than I was, is Skyrim and Dragon Age 2.
1260127	1262029	I'm trying to juggle between the two of those.
1262649	1284948	since I got the DSi XL for Christmas I've also been playing oddly enough Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass the you know the the touch the stylus only controls are actually really good they do a good job on it I have the little feather shaped stylus as the pre-order bonus so I got it when it was brand new and I'm only just now playing it it's like five year old game six year old game
1285438	1285918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1309204	1314206	and I did cheat to give myself gold because I could not take being broke and always being in my inventory cap anymore.
1314226	1315466	So clearly you're a PC player.
1315847	1316027	Yeah.
1316287	1319948	Have you experimented with any of those mods like the ones that are supposed to enhance your performance?
1319968	1330552	Yeah, I have a world map replacer that shows me where all the roads are in a way that isn't like all fakey and it's not too obtrusive looking.
1331152	1334814	So I've got a map replacer for the world map so I don't get quite as lost.
1334834	1336054	Which is cheating.
1336574	1336954	Well, yeah.
1337375	1338315	That is absolutely cheating.
1339816	1340377	Out of the way.
1360659	1367080	So yeah, I have a map replacer and the best add-on for Skyrim, and it sucks that console users can't do this.
1367501	1374422	Your favorites, like the spells and the items and the weapons that you put the little star by so you can just do your quick select menu.
1374882	1377263	There's an add-on for that that organizes everything.
1378403	1382944	And then also just a bag manager so I can sort stuff by weight and see like...
1383664	1397120	why am I always at my weight cap what the fuck do I have that's so heavy and then I can sort by oh these only weigh a pound but I have 70 of them so I can put that at the top and then sell them off that's what happens when you collect cheese wheels yeah
1398682	1421264	and the bug that I had that I mentioned on last week's show did fix itself I think I mentioned that too where everyone in Dragon's Reach hated me and thought I was a murderous criminal but yet the guards in the town were like sup bro what you doing like your armor bro and then and then the Jarl and his little dark elf bodyguard were like fucking get him and I'm like I didn't do anything this game is bugged as hell yeah that's fine now
1424836	1427658	VidPower in our chatroom says, performance enhancing mods.
1427758	1429159	It's the steroids of Skyrim.
1430120	1430880	That's a good comparison.
1430980	1437004	I haven't used the dev console in any way to give myself stats or points or skills or anything.
1437765	1442288	I got myself enough gold to buy a house with some chest in it to throw my shit in and that's it.
1442748	1443689	Did you fuck Lydia yet?
1444589	1448412	No, I don't have a spouse.
1448612	1450593	You know you can buy that house without actually spending the money.
1451594	1451934	Oh really?
1452114	1455496	See, I don't want to use the exploits or the invisible chest either.
1456296	1459638	I'd rather just give myself 20k gold and then I'm done.
1459738	1462640	Hey, if they didn't want me using that, they could patch that out right away.
1462960	1464541	But apparently they still want me to use it.
1464601	1472725	I think part of the fun, I think they realize that part of the fun with a sandbox game like Skyrim is people hacking it and fucking with it, so I don't think Bethesda's going to patch that out.
1473245	1474646	If people are having fun with it, they don't care.
1474706	1475706	It's not an online game.
1476106	1479308	That's probably a big part of the reason why they're not going MMO with it, at least right now.
1479848	1493459	I think it's inevitable there's an Elder Scrolls MMO Oh my god, that would be the buggiest piece of shit ever It's gonna be a beta test for six years Yeah, right, like they'll beta test anything with that It's good You sure?
1493499	1494060	Did you check?
1494340	1508131	Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good And Dragon Age 2 is awesome, but it's hard to juggle two meaty games like DA2 and Skyrim Alright, let's move on to Loki Loki, how was your gaming week?
1509108	1510189	My game of the week is pretty good.
1510209	1514393	I just played Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Skyrim.
1515013	1521520	Skyrim I'll mainly talk about because no one wants to hear about Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
1522000	1528907	I have to say one of the best weapons in the game, I don't know if you've come across this yet, Alan, but the Wabbajack.
1529688	1530769	The Wabbajack is awesome.
1531369	1536792	Wapjack is a staff that casts or transforms things into random things.
1537312	1545796	So, for example, you can cast it on people and the first time I hit somebody with it, it kind of went all Scott Pilgrim and they exploded into coins.
1547537	1547757	Nice.
1548297	1548858	Thanks for watching!
1564654	1568857	and then, uh, actually the quest to get that was also really weird, which is pretty fun.
1569758	1573521	Um, but, yeah, the game is still really glitchy for me.
1573761	1578325	I just gave up on that one quest that I can't get to the person because they're under the map.
1579145	1584930	Um, it's just like, well, there's no way to get this person, so, uh, the hell with this.
1585691	1586131	And, um,
1588032	1589532	I don't know, I'm still having fun with it.
1589692	1593954	I'm level 41, I think?
1594794	1596254	Maybe a little further along than that.
1596374	1601196	I don't know, but I have... I think I capped out a few different skills already.
1601316	1602636	My blacksmithing, I know.
1603596	1605797	Alchemy and some other stuff, but...
1608731	1609272	It's still fun.
1609912	1613814	I just didn't play any this weekend, although I probably will tonight.
1615455	1617355	But yeah, still wasting tons of time in the game.
1617515	1619316	I think I have 90 hours in it now.
1621397	1621677	All right.
1622578	1623018	Anything else?
1625839	1626680	No, that's all I played this week.
1627276	1629017	Thank you for watching!
1649604	1657089	I don't want to say rip-off, because I called it that somewhere else, and somebody was like, it's not a rip-off, it's more inspired by it.
1657109	1659791	I'm like, okay, but it really is like Zelda.
1660212	1661813	So fine, inspired by Zelda.
1662333	1663994	I'm sorry, I did remember one thing I played.
1664235	1664855	Oh, shut up.
1664915	1665616	All right, what?
1666016	1667817	Mole Cart for the iOS.
1668718	1669579	Oh, God.
1669619	1672321	All right, that's coming up in the show later, so hold off, yeah.
1672741	1674883	All right, let's see.
1675784	1676825	What else did I play this week?
1677225	1684731	I played, I will say on the new front, I did check out that Final Fantasy XIII 2 demo, like I think a lot of you guys have, because that's one of the...
1685211	1688936	Big things that's holding people over right now that came out on the Marketplace this week.
1689256	1690718	I really liked the demo.
1691038	1700008	But of course, disclaimer, I also really liked Final Fantasy XIII, and I realized the gamer populace as a whole had its problems with it for being too linear.
1700289	1702912	It was too linear, and there's no towns, and you only have to do one thing.
1703672	1705154	And the character design is da-da-da-da.
1705334	1707675	Although, if you... I mean, and I get it.
1707715	1716142	I'm not excusing it, but I just will say, if you stick with the game, you will find that Vanille has multiple layers to her.
1716262	1717783	She is not all he-he girl.
1717843	1720285	Like, there's definitely a past there that...
1720825	1721726	I need to go and finish Lost Odyssey.
1737874	1739236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1758177	1759137	to Crystallarium.
1759578	1761999	Much easier and not as big of a pain in the ass.
1762059	1763439	You know, it's much easier to use.
1763760	1771843	Hey look, townspeople, where you can talk to random people and they'll tell you things and it kind of feels like a town and you have multiple places you can go.
1771923	1774465	Like they're definitely trying to sneak all this in the demo.
1774865	1776125	And then on top of that, you know,
1777486	1796629	I found it interesting that your party is actually only two people and your third character is that monster and your monster can be one of three monsters but the monsters all fall into one of the different categories like Sentinel or Commando or Ravager if you're familiar with Final Fantasy XIII these are kind of the character classes
1797210	1803115	So it's kind of like a build your own third character is really what it feels like to get the types of paradigms that you want.
1803535	1806738	Which, you know, I fucking love the battle system in XIII.
1806758	1807919	That's one of its huge strengths.
1808079	1813623	And Final Fantasy XIII too is really just expanding on that with letting you kind of even go further with the paradigms.
1814464	1821149	And I know this character has her haters, but I will say Chocolina is amazing.
1821169	1821930	Yeah.
1822523	1828887	Chocolina is like half Vegas showgirl, half Chocobo cosplayer at a dinky anime con.
1828967	1832769	It's like Carnival in Argentina or something, or Rio de Janeiro.
1833290	1834110	It's pretty bad.
1835331	1840254	And she has a voice actor like this, and she just sounds like she's so happy.
1841935	1842755	I was dying.
1842995	1850040	And I immediately went on all my Warcraft servers and reserved the name Chocolina for future use, possibly with Pandarins later on.
1851081	1853943	Um, so I guess that was really about it.
1853964	1855125	I'm trying to think if there was anything else.
1855405	1859469	Um, DS, I went back and started playing Retro Game Challenge on the DS again.
1859549	1862773	Because, you know, again, I was kind of revisiting old games I wanted to play again.
1863113	1864694	And Retro Game Challenge was an awesome DS game.
1865355	1867297	Especially if you liked, you know, 8-bit classics.
1868038	1870440	So, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
1871401	1876949	So, let's go to, I'm trying to see if our, in the chat room at chat.orangelunchradio.com.
1877009	1879553	Hitstun in our chat room says, I thought the full game was out already.
1879893	1881415	January 31st is the full game.
1881455	1882056	Yeah, very close.
1882296	1883898	Same day as Soul Calibur 5, right?
1884079	1884239	Yep.
1884299	1884940	It's going to be a busy week.
1884960	1886262	Same day as Never Dead also.
1886282	1887644	Ooh, busy week, busy week.
1888344	1894988	Um, yeah, it gets, it's weird, it kind of gets busy for, actually starting from the 31st, which is very unusual.
1895088	1896509	February has a lot of big games.
1896549	1897369	All the delayed games.
1897529	1898730	Oh, Mass Effect in February, right?
1898990	1899511	No, it's March.
1899811	1900431	Oh, March, wow.
1900471	1901912	Dang, it's gonna, it's gonna get busy.
1902592	1915019	Yeah, it's, February is, uh, Binary Domain, um, Twisted Metal, uh, UFC 3, um, no, I'm thinking, forgetting a ton of shit.
1915860	1915980	Um,
1919456	1920837	SSX, I'm looking forward to SSX
1937625	1938486	All the way to Chapter 11.
1963021	1990038	it's not that same feeling like in Final Fantasy 7 when you get out of Midgar and then all of a sudden holy shit world map like it's not that great but I get the sense that Final Fantasy 13 2 is going to start with that kind of chapter 11 feeling right up front and I'm not talking about bankruptcy so I'm really excited about the game I already have mine pre-ordered and now I'm realizing shit I gotta get I have to get a PlayStation Vita and I have to get Soul Calibur 5 I'm gonna be broke you don't have to why do
1991254	1992795	Because I want it.
1992855	1994096	Because he makes bad choices.
1994156	1995517	Let me guess, because you want Luminous, right?
1996097	1996577	Yeah.
1996777	1997758	It's not a launch title.
1998418	1998598	Oh.
1999039	1999339	It's not?
1999359	1999839	I thought it was.
1999999	2000139	Nope.
2001180	2002501	Maybe I'll wait until Luminous is out then.
2002861	2003681	Just give it some time.
2004122	2009685	I mean, because if they're talking about it bombing as quickly as they think it is, you might want to wait just a little bit.
2009865	2010305	All right.
2010365	2010746	All right.
2010786	2011166	We'll see.
2011206	2011566	We'll see.
2012427	2012727	All right.
2015608	2019531	In fact, Luminous isn't even on their release list yet for Ubisoft.
2020531	2021512	Alright, let's move on.
2021832	2023933	Some quick housekeeping going on tonight.
2024514	2026395	Of course, follow us on Twitter and Facebook.
2026435	2030897	Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2030917	2035260	You can follow us on there and we'll give you little previews on what's coming up on the night show and so forth.
2036200	2038621	Also, our website, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2039002	2042504	We are in early talks about talking about some upgrades for the website for this year.
2042544	2044505	That's really awesome, especially the forums.
2044605	2048027	We really want to, and somebody was commenting on Facebook today about the forums and like
2048627	2049607	Forums need to get cleaned up.
2049647	2050628	We're like, yeah, we know.
2050688	2052808	We really want to make that workable again.
2052868	2057329	So I hope you guys will be ready for that when it's done, which hopefully will be in the next month.
2057809	2058249	That'll be cool.
2059210	2062470	And I'm going to plug the spinoff show Horde House if you like World of Warcraft.
2062930	2067972	We have a whole other show about World of Warcraft, but it's not that serious, just like this show.
2068252	2069992	Hordehouse.com if you want to check that out.
2070172	2072713	H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E dot com.
2073453	2074654	I think that's everything I wanted to plug tonight?
2075455	2075835	I guess so.
2075895	2077016	So let's get into some gaming news.
2077336	2077576	Loki.
2078397	2080179	I guess truly it's conflicting information.
2080339	2084342	Amazon's saying it is a launch title, but Ubisoft's not.
2085203	2085463	Whatever.
2086424	2089967	Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the Vita since we were just talking about the Vita.
2091108	2100755	One of the things that was announced during CES was Music Unlimited was going to be something that's going to be featured on the Vita when it launches here in North America.
2102197	2109223	and of course that's Sony's cloud-based music service that I think they actually have on the PlayStation 3 right now as well.
2110163	2125076	One of the other things that they did announce as well is a kind of a video editor called Play Memories and that's going to be for the PlayStation 3 and I also believe the Vita as well which is kind of neat.
2125897	2126938	Oh, maybe only the PS3.
2127038	2128299	I thought it was also on the Vita.
2129300	2129420	Hmm.
2130878	2134362	Um, and they'll allow you to manipulate photos and videos through the PS3.
2135102	2136564	I thought they had a video editor.
2136584	2140427	I thought they had one that came with the iCamera that you could download.
2140487	2144851	I thought they had something very basic too, but this sounds like... Maybe this is a little bit better than that.
2144891	2146353	Maybe a version 2.0 or something.
2146929	2148089	Okay.
2148229	2151210	And, of course, some sales numbers came out as well.
2151810	2155291	The Vita sold 500,000 units in Japan.
2155811	2165914	And, of course, they're saying that also we're going to be expecting Netflix to be coming to it as well near launch in Europe and the United States.
2167234	2168055	Not a big surprise.
2168075	2169375	Netflix is on everything, so...
2169963	2173586	It would be kind of lost if it wasn't on the Vita as well.
2174647	2176188	So, not a big surprise there.
2177469	2183454	Also, the data plans for the Vita, if you buy the 3G version, have come out.
2183474	2187097	18, he's going to charge you $14.99 a month.
2188058	2189359	And this is, of course, no contract.
2189379	2190140	$14.99 if you want 250 megabytes per month.
2190160	2191541	And $25 per month if you want 2 gigabyte cap.
2199594	2211865	and honestly, I mean, since you're not going to be using 3G to download games because that'd be so fucking slow, I would recommend, I don't know, I'd recommend not getting the 3G version to be honest.
2212305	2213707	Just save some money and just...
2214506	2216148	There's some folks in the chat room.
2216449	2219012	Taiki in chat says, I'm going for broke.
2219052	2219833	3G all in.
2220094	2223158	Alpha Cananogram in 3D says, getting 3G for the hell of it.
2223238	2223658	GPS.
2224960	2225260	Okay.
2225861	2227043	GPS.
2228004	2229987	Then why not... I would just recommend getting a...
2231087	2233668	Game like a virgin mobile phone or something like that.
2233728	2234288	I pay $25 a month.
2234969	2235709	Unlimited data.
2236209	2237169	It's also 3G.
2237850	2238610	And it's a phone.
2239250	2241971	So, and if you root it, you can tether to it.
2242031	2244612	So, nah, I get 3G anyways.
2246032	2251594	But yeah, if you want to get the 3G version, more power to you, I guess.
2251674	2253535	But that's what it's going to cost you.
2255831	2256171	All right.
2257231	2260712	I was trying to look up how the 3DS sold when it originally came out in Japan.
2260752	2264173	Because, you know, a lot of people are really dogging on the Vita and its sales numbers.
2264213	2265893	But how did it compare to the 3DS?
2265953	2267853	Because the 3DS had a lot of growing pains too.
2268473	2271074	You know, obviously that was kind of a very slow build.
2271474	2275715	So, I mean, is it really fair to be razzing on the Vita when the 3DS had its share of launch problems?
2275775	2281216	I mean, not hardware necessarily, but, you know, just quality of software.
2282995	2289840	I think I teased you that you want to get the Vita on launch day because it's important to you that they lower the price of the Vita six months later.
2290401	2294844	Then have an ambassador program where you get fucking Crash Bandicoot and they're like, that's all the vintage shit we have.
2294904	2295405	Sorry, thanks.
2295425	2295865	Here you go.
2296145	2298027	So you can be mad about something else.
2298047	2300609	I would hope for a Final Fantasy game, but I guess that's the wrong company.
2300649	2301589	It's got to be a first party.
2301649	2303190	So, all right.
2303551	2308815	Also going to our chat room at chat.orangelaunchery.com, Rama says, if you're smart, get the Vita from AT&T.
2308855	2310876	It'll be $99 with a two-year contract.
2310916	2311097	Really?
2311137	2311497	Is that true?
2311637	2312277	I didn't hear about that.
2313278	2313919	Sounds interesting.
2314099	2317381	It's probably speculation because there's no contracts for it.
2317861	2320363	Maybe there's an arrangement that AT&T could have, though.
2321264	2323705	Ranma says, tether off your smartphones, people.
2324766	2328589	STO Under Matt says, I don't see the point of the 3G since it's Wi-Fi everywhere.
2329289	2330410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2352128	2352649	Alright, anyhow.
2353590	2354991	Let's talk about some PC gaming.
2355091	2360237	Obviously, one big PC game we're going to get at some point in 2012 is Diablo 3.
2361198	2372410	Now, there was a very interesting kind of controversy this week with Diablo 3 where Bashyok, one of the community managers for Blizzard, posted on Twitter essentially that Diablo 3 was confirmed for consoles.
2372470	2373812	He didn't say that, but he did...
2374572	2381700	Answer a user question saying, oh, well, that's already in the works and so-and-so is the manager behind it, basically.
2382020	2385504	So it pretty much confirmed without confirming it that there is a version in the works.
2385864	2391270	But then Blizzard came back and quickly kind of revoked that tweet saying, you know, we have no announcement on that at this time, but...
2391710	2392391	Come on, people.
2392451	2393351	We've known for forever.
2393852	2395853	Blizzard's been hiring the people for consoles.
2396133	2398575	They're at least exploring a Diablo 3.
2399656	2400776	They'll probably do it.
2400816	2406960	But my question is with the real money auction house, how in the hell is that going to work on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network?
2407401	2411403	Because I can't see that they're going to be able to run something like that on those services.
2411764	2416527	And that's going to be a huge moneymaker for Diablo 3 and essentially fund the whole online multiplayer part of it.
2418226	2419988	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2437803	2439424	Very good at that tonight, by the way.
2439484	2441564	Yeah, I was going back to what you were saying about the 3DS.
2441604	2444885	Now, how often or how far from launch were you talking about for numbers?
2445325	2447126	I guess, well, it's been a couple, okay.
2447146	2448366	So within the first, I'd say, week, they sold 282,000 units.
2448446	2448706	In the U.S.
2448726	2448906	or Japan?
2448926	2449407	This is Japan.
2449567	2450987	Okay, all right.
2464731	2465071	Fair enough.
2465232	2467314	So, in about a week.
2468254	2469796	So, yeah, they're a little ahead.
2470356	2471257	Alright, that's fair.
2472438	2478844	So, but it isn't millions, you know, but, okay, so it did a lot.
2479084	2479565	It's the 3DS.
2479605	2480846	It had some more people.
2480906	2487952	Yeah, it launched in February, or towards the end of February, and by the end of March, they were about 800,000 yens in Japan.
2489494	2490715	Alright, so 3DS was ahead.
2492375	2506840	Alright, also on the Diablo 3 front, one other thing I wanted to say is that one fact that could be holding up the game, or people have been speculating to hold up the game, from a global launch that Blizzard has insisted on doing, is the ratings in South Korea.
2507180	2511982	The game has not been able to be rated in South Korea for forever, and a lot of that is because of the Real Money Auction House.
2512422	2516764	Well, the news came out this week that Diablo 3 was officially rated.
2516824	2520005	It's rated 18+, according to the game's rating board page.
2520525	2526027	and so that means that now it's been rated everywhere so Blizzard, how about a release date?
2527047	2531989	Unless there is truly something else holding up the release of this game that is highly anticipated.
2532069	2534010	Anyone else looking forward to Diablo 3 or is it just me?
2534030	2537191	Of course I'm getting a free one thanks to the Warcraft Blood Pact.
2537591	2539572	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2555260	2581752	I saw it pop up on one of the new communities on LiveJournal I've been following is ONTD Games because now ONO they didn't have a games community and the story popped up on there like it was new news and it was sourced to a site that had just run it this week so I think Blizzard is putting it out there again for whatever reason but yeah you can still sign up for it so hey if you want to tell Blizzard you're going to give them money every month for 12 months I think they're going to let you do it I just think the rewards are going to change at some point
2584144	2586066	And for the record, no, I'm not excited about Diablo 3.
2587186	2589327	But you never really played Diablo 2, did you?
2589908	2590788	I played Diablo 1.
2591989	2592910	I like Diablo 1.
2593270	2594751	Why not the 3 then?
2594991	2596992	I don't play that much on PC.
2597292	2607678	It doesn't seem like... Right now, I'm doing a lot of looting and grinding in Skyrim, and that kind of fulfills my need for doing looting and grinding.
2607698	2610040	I don't need another game to do that.
2611120	2613742	Shane, by the way, looked up the whole Luminous thing in private message.
2613863	2617926	It's coming out February 22nd is the release date.
2617946	2619607	So it's launch window, like that first month.
2619627	2620808	Let's put it this way.
2620828	2623530	It's not on Ubisoft's release list yet.
2623670	2625031	I still think that's tentative.
2625091	2628033	I don't think that it's actually coming out that day yet.
2628334	2631416	I would trust Ubisoft and their information, you know.
2633516	2637679	because they just sent us the update about Ghost Recon being delayed to May.
2639100	2640501	But it's not on the release list.
2640821	2645564	I will ask this week, though, because I was curious on that myself, especially since they have box art now.
2645604	2647345	That usually means that's close.
2648045	2650587	And the song list in Luminous looks hot.
2650727	2655170	And they could very well say, oh, yeah, here, it's coming out on the 14th or 22nd or whatever.
2656811	2658112	All right, let's move on.
2658132	2659533	Alan, what do you got for us?
2660749	2661970	XBOX LIVE ARCADE HOUSE PARTY 2012
2688169	2689450	Yeah, it's the same thing.
2689490	2690391	It's the same thing in the winter.
2690551	2692892	Yeah, so the 2012 of the Hurrah!
2693053	2694634	Our XBLA is so awesome.
2694934	2713507	It's going to start on February 15th with the titles Alan Wake's American Nightmare, The Long-Awaited I Am Alive, EA's Warp, and a game that's name is spelled so confusingly I think it's just deliberately there to troll.
2714087	2717490	It's N-E-X-U-I-Z, which I'm calling Nezui's.
2719142	2720264	Nexes, maybe?
2720284	2721105	I think it's Nexes.
2722346	2723368	I like Nexuese, though.
2723428	2724309	It makes it sound exquisite.
2726589	2735195	Those four games, we don't really have prices yet point-wise on what they're going to be, but February 15th is when those four games are going to drop and all that goes down.
2735736	2743782	Also, there's a part of this for Windows 7 mobile operating systems for the Windows 7 phones, the smartphones that Windows put out.
2744242	2747704	Everyone has either an iPhone or an Android, so whatever.
2748105	2751207	There's also a bunch of games coming out for that as well.
2751247	2754209	If you're also among one of those people that plays games for Windows Live,
2756095	2756435	Somebody?
2756795	2757075	Anybody?
2757596	2760557	I still have Game Room on Games for Windows Live.
2760577	2762297	I don't remember the last time I touched it, but it's there.
2764818	2766178	Aren't you glad you bought those games?
2766399	2766799	Shut up.
2768639	2771340	House Party starts February 15th of those four games.
2772801	2775122	Is there any buy four, get one free?
2776222	2778863	If you buy all four of those games, get $100 stolen from your Xbox account?
2778883	2784745	I've checked a few sites, including Major Nelson's blog post, and no, it doesn't really seem that way.
2784985	2785125	Hmm.
2785385	2791530	And this one's supposed to be geared more towards teenagers and stuff, because hence their edgy commercial that they had in there.
2791630	2792291	Ooh, edgy.
2792971	2796935	Well, edgy being that there's teenagers having a house party, you know.
2797896	2799457	Because, you know, everybody has a house party.
2799517	2799717	I'm sorry.
2799737	2802580	Hey, I'm going to grab the liquor and we're going to play Xbox Live Arcade.
2802740	2804521	Your house party is invalid.
2804882	2805142	No, no.
2805262	2807424	Your house party is invalid without kid and play.
2807444	2807524	Okay.
2807964	2808624	Let's be real.
2809005	2809585	That is true.
2810145	2817229	If you want a house party, Microsoft, if you want a house party people are going to pay attention to, you need to find out whatever the fuck happened to Kid and Play.
2817489	2824652	I'm sure one of them is not dead, but... One of them's got to be alive somewhere and desperate for money.
2825553	2826733	I'm going to Wikipedia right now.
2826753	2827974	I want to know what happened to Kid and Play.
2829375	2837539	They do have also, there's a game from Double Fine coming out for the Kinect that's like, I don't even remember what the fuck they're calling it, but it's just a bunch of little Kinect mini games for...
2839382	2840683	You know, from Double Fine.
2840983	2846748	But it almost surprised me a lot of that was the Kinect... What are the free shit that they put out?
2847348	2847868	Fun Labs?
2848249	2849149	It's like that, but paid.
2850290	2857875	On June 23, 2010, Kid and Play appeared on Lopez Tonight and performed Rollin' with Kid and Play from their album Too Hype.
2858356	2866201	At a 2010 Tribeca Film Festival, Kid stated that Play and I also have a television series in the works, so the future is bright.
2866221	2866782	I'd watch that.
2867282	2867682	Ha ha ha!
2870851	2872372	How fucking old are Kid and Play now?
2872392	2873212	Let me look at this up here.
2873272	2875534	Kid was born in 64, so he's 47.
2876214	2878956	I bet he could still get down.
2880812	2886856	Also in Xbox news, Microsoft has released the sales numbers, which they haven't done since October.
2887837	2895001	And it sounds like 66 million units sold worldwide as of this press release they put out.
2895121	2897983	And by units, they mean stolen Xbox Live accounts.
2899404	2904287	The last time they... Funny enough, half of them were sold in Poland, and we can't figure out why.
2904307	2904707	Yeah.
2906268	2915753	uh then that's roughly 10 million more than the 55 56 million they said that they had sold worldwide at the end of October so 10 million over one holiday season
2917237	2924344	The Kinect now is at 18 million units, which I don't know what the numbers are for the move, but I'm pretty sure it's not 18 million.
2924364	2925765	It's probably not 18 million.
2926005	2930369	You can never really get accurate numbers of the move because they count every single little accessory.
2931150	2933592	They sell you the starter kit.
2933852	2938096	Oh, look, we've sold you three move units or four move units.
2938996	2942800	Number of Kinect games worth it for those 18 million people?
2943824	2944065	Two.
2945566	2946106	It's growing.
2946747	2948668	It's slowed down, obviously.
2948688	2955273	It's plateaued since the insane launch week that Kinect had, but 18 million units is a very respectable number.
2956054	2971746	Also, they've come out and said that live accounts that are in service, which means that people have just configured a live account and they log into it, not necessarily gold, but live accounts is nearly 40 million users, which is about 60% of the worldwide sold.
2972466	2991922	60% of Xbox users have live in some capacity even if it's not gold they're not paying for it now where's the number about how many of those accounts are still uncompromised because that's what I'd like to know so as far as those 40 million silver versus gold it doesn't say but 60% is pretty reasonable I think
2992076	2992817	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3012284	3012704	I don't know.
3013545	3014186	It's interesting.
3014626	3027317	VidPower actually links an article he found that's related saying that as part of the house party promotion, if you buy all four games, you will get 800 Microsoft points free, which is like, what, a quarter of a FIFA gold pack?
3029559	3030580	I see what you did there.
3030600	3030921	It's like 20%.
3031501	3031902	There you go.
3033343	3033663	All right.
3034604	3035565	Moving on, Loki.
3035585	3035665	Okay.
3037150	3044416	So, of course, there was rumors that, oh, the new systems, PlayStation and Xbox, are going to be at E3.
3044796	3048199	Well, it's too soon at least for the PlayStation.
3048339	3053483	According to Kaz Harai, PlayStation 4 will not be at E3.
3054364	3057406	They have no plans on bringing it out at E3.
3057446	3062009	And it says, you know, we're not making announcements at E3.
3062029	3062190	Okay.
3063971	3069694	I do want to just say, I told you so last week on the show, but to be fair, pretty much everybody was thinking that this would be the case.
3070114	3074016	It didn't take Miss Cleo to figure that out, that there was not going to be a PlayStation 4 at this next E3.
3074696	3085201	I think what it's going to be, I think it'll be at least a year after, and honestly, I mean, I know that they're kind of like, okay, whoever's first out of the gate is going to have the best chances as far as it goes.
3085641	3092404	I think that Nintendo's going to be stumbling out of the gate, to be honest, and I don't think they're really going to have to play much catch-up, and
3093304	3096987	Besides, give it another year and they can copy whatever works well on Nintendo's system.
3097087	3102050	I could sort of see Microsoft announcing a new console, but they don't have to.
3102431	3106954	Because you're right, I think they can give Nintendo a chance to eat dirt a little bit, maybe.
3107494	3118061	But Microsoft, especially after the story that Alan just read about that the sales numbers are still good, Microsoft still... If they could get those one or two killer Kinect games...
3119282	3123123	and I'm talking something better than that Star Wars thing that still isn't out.
3123163	3127984	If they could get those one or two Killer Connect titles that even the hardcore gamers must have, I think they're going to have it.
3128404	3133446	Now here's a real question about Sony and I think this is a much better question.
3133806	3138147	So if you want to play games analyst for a minute, those of you listening, here's a real question for you.
3138887	3142448	How much emphasis will still be on the Sony move this year?
3143408	3146989	I think that's a real question to ask about E3 is that will Sony give up
3148550	3158362	Just like maybe they did on the, well, I guess the PlayStation Eye kind of turned into the move, but, you know, will PlayStation decide to give up on the move a little bit now that they're going to have the Vita out, and maybe we'll focus on that a little more?
3158843	3163709	Or are they really still going to push the move as an alternative to the Kinect and to the Wii?
3163929	3165131	That's a question for you.
3165431	3166052	I think
3166292	3169854	Well, they've kind of succeeded in a few avenues there.
3171014	3179077	One, they've got better integration with their motion control stuff into their core games than Microsoft does.
3179157	3189322	I mean, because, hands down, the move for Resistance and Killzone and SOCOM and stuff like that, it actually seems like it would work.
3189702	3194484	Versus Voice Commands to Throw a Grenade in Halo, which seems very tacked on.
3194504	3194784	Yeah.
3195564	3196525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3216602	3218343	Okay, I have to go to chat room with this comment.
3218863	3221564	Kaijudo in our chat room says, Microsoft needs a new system.
3221644	3222725	That thing is dead.
3223245	3226086	With all due respect, did you not hear what Alan just said?
3226746	3228487	Like, about the sales figures.
3228787	3230348	And, dude, I get what you're saying.
3230428	3234649	Like, you know, especially after the whole hack crap, you know how I feel about the Xbox.
3234669	3235270	And I get what you're saying.
3235610	3238191	But I think Microsoft, let me kind of give you an analogy.
3238271	3240772	Microsoft is right now, especially with the Kinect,
3241332	3244415	sitting kind of where Nintendo was about three years ago.
3244935	3249999	Where the core gamers, like yourself and some of us, weren't taking them so seriously.
3250319	3254282	Yet they were still slaying with sales figures because the families were adopting them.
3254683	3256904	And I think that's kind of where Kinect is right now.
3257245	3261268	Like, maybe they're losing a lot of core gamers, but they're still selling systems.
3261568	3262829	And you can't call it dead because of that.
3262849	3264390	I don't think they're losing core gamers at all.
3264630	3266652	I mean, in fact, I think that Kinect's working well.
3267933	3269414	To be fair, I don't think they are either.
3269614	3269995	But...
3270735	3282988	I think the PlayStation 3 is gaining a lot of ground I think it's not that the Xbox is running away with core gamers but I think a lot of core gamers are now looking at the PlayStation 3 going, huh, maybe I want one of those
3284724	3285264	Thanks for watching!
3301391	3306275	and then they have their core gamers that are playing their franchises and stuff that they keep putting out.
3307216	3322950	And they've tried to get people excited that are playing core games to buy the Kinect with Forza 4 stuff and with Halo but honestly it's just such a poor attempt at tacking that stuff on that's not really accomplishing what they're hoping to accomplish.
3322970	3324211	They're trying to get people to kind of
3325492	3326113	Thanks for watching!
3342942	3355450	It's just it's not working right now because what they've done for these core games to implement Kinect functionality is really cheap, and it shows.
3356091	3363696	I guess going back to the original question about the PlayStation Move, I guess you will always have those games that are ported to the Move from the Kinect.
3363716	3365657	I mean, even though the two technologies are kind of different.
3365998	3369300	Like, certainly you get the games like Just Dance that they adapt for both.
3369320	3370340	I think you'll still see a lot of stuff like that.
3370360	3371061	I think it's doing well, though.
3371401	3372162	Yeah, I think so.
3373762	3374823	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
3375203	3377384	Talking about other releases and things coming out.
3378064	3383126	Another fighting game is going to be repackaged with all the download content, and you might have heard, it is Mortal Kombat.
3383546	3389729	Mortal Kombat Complete Edition, of course, complete with a K, is coming out all over again.
3390129	3394191	It is going to have the original game, all of the DLC packs, so including Freddy.
3394551	3398292	It's going to have Mortal Kombat, songs inspired by the Warriors.
3398412	3399593	Is that that old-ass...
3400553	3402294	I think it might be.
3403215	3404255	Or it might be the new one.
3404335	3404695	I don't know.
3404976	3406256	They have a new soundtrack.
3406296	3408698	But if it's that old CD, that's awesome.
3409318	3409698	I don't know.
3410399	3420104	Also, you get a download code of the 1995 Mortal Kombat film, which was decent for a video game movie because a lot of them aren't very good.
3420144	3422365	But the original Mortal Kombat movie was kind of awesome.
3422385	3422825	It was alright.
3423086	3424927	And then the sequel was bad.
3424947	3426067	The sequel was bad.
3426087	3427408	It was really bad.
3427428	3427508	Yeah.
3427628	3428950	The TV show was even worse.
3428990	3430152	Was there ever a third movie?
3430392	3432455	There was talk about a third movie, but they just never did it.
3432595	3433497	I think they're still doing it.
3433998	3435199	It's a little late now.
3435279	3440748	Well, now that the whole resurgence, I guess there was those YouTube videos that really weren't bad.
3442719	3449342	So, anyhow, it is coming out on February 28th, the Mortal Kombat Complete Edition, both on the 360 and the PlayStation 3.
3450182	3455184	So, if you're like me and you never downloaded any of the DLC, this may be of value to you.
3455244	3455684	I don't know.
3456684	3457645	I probably won't get it.
3458425	3463387	I don't need the 1995 film that bad, and the DLC, if I want it, I can probably download cheaper.
3463407	3464747	Ask yourself, do you like renting stuff?
3466688	3466989	Do you?
3467069	3468870	I mean, seriously, do you guys like renting stuff?
3469331	3473874	Because Warner Brothers says, fuck you, because they don't like people that rent ship.
3473935	3475996	They're going to push the window out to 56 days.
3476597	3481281	And also, I wonder if there's going to be the online pass.
3481361	3482942	For listeners that don't know, explain the...
3485044	3512254	56 day window basically Warner Brothers right now they had implemented a 28 day window to basically block anybody that rents movies from buying directly from them if they want to buy stuff to put in their store they have to go out to Walmart or retail or Amazon or wherever and buy them and put them on well technically they could sell you the product directly later on but you know it's
3512814	3520237	Now it's a 56-day window, and so Netflix is not going to have it until 56 days later.
3521678	3529421	But Redbox, they're like, well, fuck it, we're just going to go buy it at the store, as is Blockbuster.
3529541	3533043	Blockbuster, those are the big three that were kind of affected by it.
3533943	3552292	and also you know you may like your Harry Potter well as of you know last year at the end of the last year they're all out of circulation now they're they took all the movies out of circulation so they can go re-release them like Disney does basically Warner hates people fucking 3D they're gonna release all the Harry Potter movies in 3D wait for it well it wasn't the
3553252	3557634	Warner Brothers fucking hates people that do not buy their movies.
3557895	3566779	They want to basically take everybody out of rental to buy their stuff and to stream their stuff using their ultraviolet service is what they're looking to do.
3568259	3572001	Which isn't going to work because they're diluting it out there.
3572061	3574702	All these companies think they can build their own Netflix.
3574762	3575623	It's just not going to work.
3576743	3580505	If that's the kind of thing you want to support, then by all means...
3582321	3584382	I remember when this shit was going on with VHS movies.
3584402	3586022	Video stores would get it before everybody else.
3586062	3589024	Hold on, Ranma, you're talking about the reverse.
3610194	3611835	You're talking about the total reverse.
3612156	3619461	What used to happen then, I used to work at a video store way back when, those VHS tapes used to cost like $99 when they first came out.
3619521	3620122	That's why.
3620262	3622404	It was rental and sell-through.
3622444	3634533	They basically had rental movies would come out at one point, then eventually the studio would drop the price to sell-through because, I mean, yeah, you can go buy the movie the same day that it comes to the rental stores, but it's going to cost you $100 or $150 to buy that movie.
3634553	3634634	Yeah.
3637916	3638957	But then they had programs.
3640057	3641858	Warner's tried a bunch of things.
3641878	3644540	They've tried distributing their own movies and that didn't work.
3644580	3646180	They tried these programs.
3646981	3650663	Trust me, working in the distribution business, it's fun.
3651483	3652824	All right, let's move on, Alan.
3654324	3663589	Mad Catz has released the latest line of the Fight Stick controllers they're putting out for Capcom's Street Fighter X Tekken.
3664290	3665791	They've done a redesign of it.
3666091	3671174	There's two different models now, the Fight Stick Pro and the Arcade Fight Stick Versus Edition.
3671754	3678178	The latter, which aside from having, I think, more detailed art on the top panel of it,
3678938	3704351	is a there is it comes with an accessory if you have two of them you can snap them together and basically make a mock like arcade board where you have two people standing side by side like they were fighting at a real arcade in case you want to sit a little closer to your friend yeah so if you can find a way to get like a table and put this up up there you can then have two people for like for you know tournaments that you want to host
3707633	3709394	Get you to buy two of them instead of one.
3709974	3710614	Yeah, exactly.
3711175	3719519	And there's also going to be a Fight Pad SD, which is going to be 15% smaller roughly than the previous Fight Pads that they've put out.
3719620	3726784	And they don't have a price point or release date yet for either of these products, whether it be the new Fight Pad or the Arcade Sticks.
3727524	3750574	but they are aiming for a to be congruous with the March 6th release of the game itself and I have a little side story about this all right I remember in February of 09 when Street Fighter 4 came out not Super Street Fighter 4 but the original one I wanted one of the fight pads Mad Catz and I have it right here Rob if you could hand that to me
3752256	3752897	I paid so much for this.
3779494	3789266	So whenever I hear that Capcom keeps giving MadCatz their exclusive license for the fight sticks and the arcade whatever, I'm like, MadCatz products suck.
3789987	3793030	But that just happens.
3793351	3794793	The stuff comes dead out of the box.
3794813	3796515	It can be anything.
3798205	3799066	He's mad, damn it.
3799166	3803270	I was going to say, Loki, before I throw it out, if you want to fuck with it, it's here.
3803310	3806213	If you want to take it home and open it, I don't know.
3806633	3807133	But that's all.
3807714	3808555	Loki, fix it.
3808655	3808915	I know.
3809676	3811097	Techmaster Loki.
3811397	3812058	Read between the lines.
3812078	3813279	Techmaster Loki, fix it.
3815612	3816653	Where's the thingy?
3816673	3817714	Loki's evaluating it.
3817774	3821719	Well, first off, you're missing the breakaway part of the cable here.
3822079	3822680	Oh, yeah, that's right.
3823901	3828966	Anyway, yeah, just go to Kotaku or Joystick if you want to see what the fight sticks look like.
3829747	3830087	All right.
3830788	3831789	Let's move on to release dates.
3831809	3835133	We're going to travel the world and check out some upcoming releases coming soon.
3835868	3836849	to a game store near you.
3862685	3882388	I hope you like Gran Turismo and I hope they haven't bought Gran Turismo 5 because that's really that's all coming out this week Gran Turismo 5 again yes Gran Turismo 5 XL edition it includes now this is kind of cool it includes all the well the spec 2.0 update and a voucher for $20 worth of DLC and it's only 40 bucks
3883349	3884209	Okay, that's cool.
3884329	3885209	So, I mean, it's not bad.
3885910	3891351	I am terrible at, like, Gran Turismo and the realistic racers, but that's a good deal.
3891451	3891691	That's neat.
3891711	3892451	Yeah, I mean, it's not bad.
3893011	3895891	And My Pet Puppy 3D for the 3DS from 505 Games.
3896171	3897012	That is it.
3897232	3897912	My Pet Puppy!
3898092	3898492	It was funny.
3898552	3901432	This week, there was actually supposed to be games coming out, but nothing came out.
3901592	3902533	It was a dead week.
3902973	3903313	Nothing.
3903593	3905333	Wait, what do you mean games were supposed to come out and then they didn't?
3905353	3906373	Like, a bunch of delayed stuff?
3906433	3909074	Yeah, there was two games that were supposed to come out this week, and both of them got delayed.
3909114	3909454	What games?
3910474	3916336	This week was supposed to be 4-1 Action Pack from South Peak or something like that.
3916356	3918636	A bunch of really terrible PlayStation Network games.
3919236	3924057	And then there was the National Geographic Challenge, which got delayed to the 24th.
3924177	3928198	You know, I'm thinking even if those games were coming out, you would have said this week was uneventful.
3928218	3928979	I'm just saying.
3929499	3929899	Just saying.
3930619	3931920	Alright, going to Japan.
3932380	3938983	Real quick though, one release I wanted to say that's not on this list because it's an Xbox Live thing.
3939943	3947807	DLC for Saints Row the Third, the first in the season pass, it will be released this week, Genki Bowl 7, which I am excited to play.
3948940	3975080	Alright, let's move to the Japanese release dates Which are a little more exciting on the Xbox 360 to start us off Dead Rising 2 gets a price reduction in Japan I think some folks may be excited about this Onichanbara Z Kagura comes out this week in Japan So I think this is like a sequel to the original Onichanbara Which if you didn't know what that game was It's basically women with big titties slaying zombies It is a woman wearing lingerie and a cowboy hat With a samurai sword killing zombies That's right
3976441	3997928	and how like in other words the formula for a perfect game yet it doesn't end up on any end of the year best list it's not really yeah it's kind of one of those on paper it sounded awesome it's it's part of the simple series the simple series had a really weird they had a lineup of games that was just so up some of them were just like casual games some of them were really weird
3998688	4002110	Earth Defense Force was part of the simple series in Japan on the PlayStation 2.
4002150	4004071	This was also part of the series.
4004752	4009495	One that I wish that would come over here or at least make a sequel to is Zombies vs. Ambulance.
4009775	4012437	It's an ambulance and you run over zombies with the ambulance.
4012757	4018180	And they also had another one that was like some chicks in dresses maids with like mini guns killing zombies.
4018500	4019621	A lot of zombie killing.
4021922	4023383	I like games that are over the top.
4023443	4024084	Why can't we get more of them?
4024104	4024924	It was just ridiculous.
4024964	4027846	That's why I thought Saints Row was really awesome actually.
4028861	4034646	Also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, Power Up Heroes and Red Dead Redemption Complete Edition.
4034746	4036888	All of those coming out on January 19th.
4037268	4040131	Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, some of the same stuff.
4040231	4043213	Dead Rising 2, Red Dead Redemption Complete Edition, getting the price reductions.
4043534	4047017	But there are some new things this week, including Nobunaga no Yabu Tendo.
4047157	4049078	That is actually, again, a price reduction.
4049479	4052181	As well as Trinity Zil-O-Zero.
4052461	4055004	All of those games I just mentioned, PlayStation 3 best hits.
4055504	4063410	Next big release for Japan on PlayStation 3 is probably Armored Core 5 but that's on the 26th so you still have a little ways to go before that is out.
4063790	4069034	Keep in mind the PlayStation Vita is already out in Japan so they are getting this week Wipeout 2048 on the Vita.
4069554	4070695	Makes its way to Japan this week.
4071135	4073217	I believe that's a launch title for us over here.
4074257	4096552	the Wii really doesn't have a lot there's a price reduction of Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes and I'm quickly looking to see if the PSP or no 3DS Labyrinth no Kanata and Rhythm Kaito R Kotei Napoleon no Isan comes out from Sega this week trying to see if that's a that's Rhythm Thief I believe
4097392	4097812	Yes, it is.
4099053	4100694	Yeah, Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's Treasure.
4101354	4102515	It's the Japanese version of that.
4102975	4105176	And Runabout 3D Drive Impossible.
4105276	4106516	So kind of a bigger week of 3DS.
4106536	4108517	Whoa, hold on a second.
4108557	4109177	Who's that from?
4109578	4110238	Rocket Company?
4111886	4113748	Runabout 3D Drive Impossible.
4114269	4114509	Yes!
4115410	4116632	Runabout's fucking awesome.
4116912	4117873	I have not heard of this series.
4117973	4120596	Runabout's been around since the original PlayStation.
4120716	4122078	It came out over here as Felony 179.
4122398	4128725	And it's basically a game where you drive around and smash into stuff with your car and cause damage.
4129066	4130628	Oh yeah, I can see that from the screenshots.
4130708	4132590	It looks like you can drive a tank in one of them.
4134048	4134829	That's a pretty fun game.
4135389	4136489	Oh, interesting.
4136610	4137610	I wouldn't give it another second thought.
4137650	4138010	Very cool.
4138690	4140831	Yuki in our chatroom says, I thought it was a Dreamcast game.
4140851	4143092	Of course, that could be a delay.
4143813	4145733	Yuki might be commenting on another game we mentioned.
4145774	4148815	Runabout was also a Dreamcast game, I believe, as well.
4148875	4151856	It was Dreamcast and PlayStation 1.
4152396	4153637	Maybe PlayStation 2.
4153957	4155298	It was really simple graphics.
4155338	4157098	Well, it comes back in 3D this week.
4157158	4159299	No, it's PlayStation 1, for sure.
4160200	4162661	Let's move on with the UK releases.
4163021	4163461	Two games.
4164382	4169227	Wednesday the 18th we're going to get Haunt for the 360 and Scary Girl for the 360.
4170048	4172330	Which are download titles.
4173151	4174792	Boring week over there in the UK.
4174812	4176314	Hope you enjoy what you got already.
4176394	4180378	And Scary Girl I guess is a graphic novel tie-in and it's a Squeenix produced game.
4181013	4182674	It's a fighting game, I believe.
4183675	4186357	If I'm not mistaken, Haunt is a Nana Onsha game.
4186918	4188279	The folks that made Parappa the Rapper.
4188559	4190120	But don't expect it to be a music game.
4190540	4191641	Yeah, it's not a music game.
4191801	4196145	I thought Scary Girl was a fighting game.
4196185	4199327	But there was some other fighting game that was coming out that was like that.
4200248	4201629	It might not have been Scary Girl, I don't remember.
4202250	4202630	DarkSakura.com
4218181	4220723	and Kid Icarus is going to be supporting that as well.
4220743	4227127	They're going to be getting a left-handed mode with the Circle Pad Pro which looks kind of awkward.
4227227	4228989	I don't know how that would be holding that.
4229269	4234993	For the record, now I'm really pissed off that that Circle Pad Pro thing is a GameStop exclusive because Alan's left-handed.
4235273	4242218	He could actually use that because I'll probably buy that game and he could kind of use that mode but I'm not going to GameStop, period.
4242238	4243258	Um...
4244479	4244959	Thanks for watching!
4262246	4279540	It's hard on your hands anyway, so they're going to be coming out with a stand, if you will, for the 3DS that will be included with Kickerous Uprising, because apparently the game is so uncomfortable to play on the 3DS it requires a stand, making it not really a portable system anymore, but...
4280896	4285959	Yes, apparently touching the screen works better if it's secured, according to Nintendo.
4287621	4288561	That's kind of weird.
4289122	4292144	Weird to bundle a peripheral like that with Kid Icarus.
4292444	4295706	To me, that screams design flaw right there.
4295886	4297987	We have to be getting a new 3DS to C3.
4298028	4298608	Here's what it is.
4298688	4303931	It's because you have to touch the screen or whatever, and it just doesn't work.
4304292	4309455	If you've played even Metroid Prime, 3D Hunters or whatever it was,
4310896	4337695	The original DS Kind of had that same type of setup Where you would move with the directional pad And you used your right hand with the stylus To kind of look around And it was fucking uncomfortable to play that game So this, kind of the same thing But now you use an analog stick instead It would be easier if you could aim Like if you had the Circle Pad Pro Aim with the right analog And move with the left And then you wouldn't need the touch screen But then what's the point?
4339292	4342461	Now, Alan, you've had your share of challenges with the 3DS.
4342481	4343765	What do you think about some of this news?
4346441	4347862	If you get it, I'll use it.
4348322	4348682	I don't know.
4349603	4351964	You're just not that excited about the 3DS to begin with?
4352184	4352624	Pretty much.
4354565	4357827	When they release the second generation of the hardware, I will give a shit.
4358727	4362309	But I'm a late adopter on purpose with Nintendo.
4362349	4366971	I'm holding my 3DS right now with one hand, kind of moving the analog stick.
4367512	4369953	Even just holding it for a few seconds is uncomfortable.
4370553	4376199	and pushing on the screen as well as I'm trying to it really starts to put a kink in my wrist there.
4376539	4381424	I would think they would have to come up with some better way of doing that.
4383542	4413145	Mario Kart is the biggest culprit because you have to hold down the accelerator and that makes my hand cramp really bad after like one track other games on the 3DS or like the purely stylus based ones are fine I will bet you anything the next 3DS we get is going to be an XL because the problem right now is everyone is saying it's too small and it cramps people's hands up that they're going to make it bigger so they can put the extra analog stick on there and it'll be an XL system I will bet you
4414463	4414803	All right.
4415864	4417166	Well, moving on.
4417806	4419548	Speaking of Mario Kart, sort of.
4420709	4426815	An interesting new game hit the iPhone, iOS, iTouch, and all that store this week.
4427275	4428597	It's called Mole Kart.
4429357	4436544	And, you know, it's kind of common these days that you see these iOS games that are very similar to games that are out there.
4436584	4437886	In fact, you might remember last week...
4438306	4459900	We were talking about kind of the same subject With Atari going after all these people Well, Nintendo may want to consider going after this game Because what makes it unique is that While they don't use Mario And that a lot of the characters are different A lot of the tracks are lifted right out of Mario Kart A lot of them, all of them
4460820	4463161	All of them are taken right from Mario Kart.
4463221	4468104	Like, the whole bouncy mushroom race thing that was huge on the Wii is in there.
4468925	4470185	Now, you played this, Loki.
4470205	4472146	I haven't even bothered to play it, but you actually got it.
4473247	4474688	Yes, I got it.
4475108	4476269	Not bought it.
4477809	4480611	And, yes, it's a complete rip-off of Mario Kart.
4480911	4489496	The thing, though, see, I don't like, once again, I don't like kart racers on the iPod because I just don't like tilt controls.
4489956	4490876	It really pisses me off.
4491297	4493918	But even, I mean, look at even the main screen here.
4493978	4498080	We have a complete ripoff of the bomb in the corner there.
4498600	4499621	Item mode, they call it.
4499781	4501641	So, yeah, they break it up.
4501761	4503682	You start off with two characters.
4503702	4507403	You can unlock two more by playing the game, and you can buy two more on top of that.
4507863	4510843	And, of course, you get Mole Man and some bear.
4512644	4522306	So, anyways, the different things that they have starting off, you have the Mole Pasture, which I want to say it's one of the tracks from the Wii game.
4523046	4523666	I don't remember its...
4524266	4524566	X Mushroom
4532868	4535189	It's definitely one of the tracks from the game.
4535650	4543073	Then you can unlock the FrigÃ© port, which is definitely one of the tracks from the Wii game.
4543774	4553739	Volcano, which is one of the old classic tracks, the Bowser Castle tracks from the Super Nintendo game that they remade the 3D in the Wii version that's in there.
4555440	4559102	Sky Remnant is another track that I think you can buy.
4559122	4559162	Um...
4562091	4575350	and then Arctic Glaciers is the ice track from Nintendo 64 version that was up-res and then Mole's Garden was Peach's, I think it's Peach's Garden or something like that or Daisy's Garden.
4575370	4576632	So in other words, it's a damn rip-off.
4576652	4578034	Yeah, everything's a rip-off.
4579890	4590414	So rather than being just, it's the same genre, because last week you were saying that companies go after third-party things that say, oh, you're copying our game, but it's like, no, it's just the same genre.
4590454	4591355	They copy the tracks.
4591375	4592315	The tracks are the same.
4592435	4593756	So this would be a valid lawsuit.
4594036	4594256	Yes.
4594976	4599318	All the power-ups are, you know, oh, this is not quite a bullet bill.
4599378	4601299	It's something different, but all the power-ups are the same.
4601459	4602879	I mean, they have all the power-ups.
4602960	4605421	But doesn't the quality of stuff like this kind of speak for itself?
4605621	4606481	It's not bad.
4607162	4608925	SmurfsVillageMolesWorld
4619005	4619925	How the hell do I play this?
4620885	4622126	It's automatic acceleration.
4622146	4623726	You have a break, and then you tilt to move.
4624346	4625367	I just move backwards.
4626067	4627747	Should I hold your mic up to your face for you?
4628287	4628747	Okay, hold it.
4628767	4629108	Yeah, sure.
4629128	4629488	I'm playing.
4630948	4632208	This game is kind of basic.
4632248	4633469	How do I use it?
4633509	4634949	Oh, you tap the item.
4634969	4636649	Yeah, you tap the item, too.
4637050	4646672	Okay, I just got a flaming pear as a power-up, and there's cows standing in the middle of the course, just like on the Wii one.
4647270	4670767	and the flaming pears I'm assuming are like the mushroom yeah because it gave me a little turbo boost and I can't drive for shit this game I mean it's one of those things where it's like I would show my friends haha look at this Mario Kart ripoff but I mean is it really worth what is this a pineapple okay it's an oh it's the it's the use it all you want nitro the frame rate on this sucks
4672771	4691171	Moomoo Meadows it's even on the fucking banner it says Moomoo Meadows on the fucking banner you know I'm thinking the developers kind of forgot that you might want to change some things that are on the track way to go
4693151	4693772	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4717472	4718913	Ah, that's fantastic.
4718953	4734584	Well, because you know, you know they're doing it in some, you know, very tiny cubicle, high production supervisor glaring down everyone's necks environment where they just, just take this track and copy it, you know, just bit by bit, detail by detail.
4734984	4736165	And so they copied it.
4739194	4740114	That's fantastic.
4740555	4741055	Good job.
4742355	4745396	Alright, let's take a moment to take a trek down memory lane.
4745916	4748417	Remember when the only game that was getting ripped off was Street Fighter 2?
4749278	4750118	Fighting Street?
4751158	4752699	Let's take a trip down memory lane.
4754319	4755240	Remember in the groove.
4755800	4756120	Alright.
4757600	4763062	Every week, DarkSakura likes to dive into the vault and pick a game that she thinks is worthy of being the classic game of the week.
4763102	4763802	But she's not here.
4764503	4767844	So instead of the classic gaming vault, we have the classic gaming cardboard box.
4769162	4776712	and Alan has dived in, thumb first, into the Classic Gaming box and pulled out a game that he thinks, hey, shows some respect.
4776792	4778253	This is a true classic right here.
4778934	4780576	Alan, what is the Classic Game of the Week this week?
4781858	4784882	This week's Classic Game is the original Half-Life.
4786266	4787086	I'm so surprised.
4787306	4787746	Release 1998.
4787866	4789747	I'm so surprised at this coming from you.
4790047	4790627	Yes, I know.
4791588	4797869	It's never been a classic game of the week, and reality check, this game is, what, 13 years old at this point?
4797889	4798089	Yes.
4800050	4808632	Half-Life was made by two former Microsoft employees, Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell, whose name might ring a few bells.
4809593	4814134	They bought the package to modify the Quake engine.
4815454	4844217	and they hacked the shit out of it to design this game and by the time they were done the Quake engine had grown into something called Gold Source which is how Source which was the big engine that Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead is based off of that's how they got that name so the original Half-Life was a modified Quake engine game it was published by believe it or not Sierra Entertainment or what Sierra Online had become before it finally closed after they made all the King's Quest and Space Quest games
4844778	4846561	So yeah, developed by Valve.
4847604	4849047	You know, a little company you might have heard of.
4850289	4852574	Published by Sierra Online and it was released...
4854193	4858217	November 19th of 1998 on the Windows PC platform.
4859258	4871390	And of course, anyone who remembers the 90s know that as far as first-person shooters go, there were the two big titles, Wolfenstein 3D, which set the place for Doom, which set the place for Duke Nukem 3D.
4871910	4875093	What Half-Life did differently and how...
4876909	4877369	Here's the par time.
4877389	4877910	Here's your time.
4877930	4878070	Yeah.
4899020	4903043	Half-Life was just like a big... I mean, it just kept going and going.
4903143	4915090	There were little chapter marks, so when you got to a certain plot point in the game and you uncovered a new area, a subtitle would say, you know, Chapter 2, Office Complex, so you know that you're progressing through the story.
4915491	4917272	But other than that, it was like a big ant farm.
4917512	4926157	You were in Black Mesa, which was a military, industrial, private firm that made, like, nuclear weapons for the government.
4926938	4927038	Um...
4928619	4945488	in Arizona, and you play Gordon Freeman, a physicist who is doing an experiment on some alien moon rock that is given to him in strange circumstances, and when he does a test on it, a dimensional rip from an alien world, a hostile alien world, opens in.
4946656	4954704	All these aliens pour out and it turns out that they were working on portal technology, like the game Portal, which came much later.
4956026	4965355	And while developing this portal stuff, they accidentally tapped into an evil alien overworld and critters showed up.
4967819	4968739	Oh no, it's Critters!
4969440	4973901	It's one of the best-rated first-person shooters of all time.
4973921	4976102	I think it's got a 97 or 98 on Metacritic.
4978402	4991626	The other big thing, which was unprecedented at the time, was that the Marine soldiers that come in in Chapter 4 or 5 to kill you, they actually had an AI, believe it or not.
4991666	4995007	Because the demons in Doom and the aliens in Duke Nukem 3D were pretty...
4995647	4999090	Dumb, you know, you could hide behind cover, you just run out and shoot them.
5000571	5024051	In Half-Life, if you ducked for cover, the computer would know to tell the NPCs to then throw a grenade, and the aiming on the grenade was accurate, so you'd be hiding behind a box or around a corner, and you would see a grenade, and it's like, oh, shit, and no one had ever played a game that hard before, where you had to actually think about how to go about killing your enemies.
5025131	5029917	Half-Life was also very different where there wasn't really multiplayer, which was really big in that day.
5029977	5032019	Or was there co-op?
5032480	5033181	It came later.
5033281	5039188	There was Half-Life Deathmatch and also Counter-Strike, which is the biggest.
5039629	5043694	That's also a hack of the Gold Source engine when Valve opened up.
5043854	5044695	Thank you for watching!
5059450	5063212	The opening of Half-Life is Gordon Freeman getting into the tram.
5064873	5065533	It's in the morning.
5065573	5066734	He's going to his day at work.
5067514	5070195	And you don't really get to control your character at all.
5070235	5075738	It's about a two or three minute intro where you're just on this tram going through the Black Mesa facility.
5076178	5077899	And what it's kind of doing is showing you...
5078499	5079300	Thanks for watching!
5097175	5116130	the designer of Bioshock if you remember the intro of Bioshock where you the plane crash lands and you're in the water and you go into the lighthouse and you're in the bathysphere and you see Rapture the City that is inspired by the tram sequence in Half-Life it's exactly a direct homage to what Half-Life did
5118191	5120972	There were a few flaws, of course, with Half-Life.
5121272	5123593	There were a lot of bullshit weapons in it that you never use.
5123634	5124874	There were like 15 different weapons.
5125014	5126255	You only needed like five of them.
5127195	5135900	Way too long, especially since the last chapter of the game, you go to the alien world to kill the big brain fetus.
5137000	5145204	That part was really ugly and it had a lot of first-person platforming where you have to jump on shit or else you fall off and die.
5145684	5151087	Even today, in 2012, you put jumping puzzles in a first-person shooter, people are like, fuck, no, this is stupid.
5151147	5151807	I don't want to do this.
5152227	5156429	Half-Life, near the end of its cycle, had a ton of that stuff.
5157550	5158830	So it wasn't without its flaws.
5160291	5187419	I believe it's also one of the as far as PC exclusive shooters the best selling this may not be true any longer but there was a point where if you bought a new sound card you got a free copy of Half-Life if you bought a graphics card or a new computer like you go to Circuit City and you get the package deal well now it's download Steam and Half-Life will cost 50 cents at some point so an absurd amount of millions of units sold in this game
5188599	5216167	and Half-Life 2 of course came out in 2004 launched the Steam store platform which of course no one knew at the time what the fuck that was and now Steam is totally integral to PC gaming and without any of this we would have never had Portal or Portal 2 our game of the year this last year Aperture Science which is the main company and Portal is hinted at as being in bidding wars with the government against Black Mesa
5217267	5223290	and always losing so they're kind of like the shitty little kid brother of Black Mesa anything else you want to say about Half-Life?
5224131	5244541	it's awesome I do a full playthrough of it at least once or twice a year it's hard as hell I can't honestly beat it without using a god mode code for at least some parts of it but it's definitely awesome and if you like first person shooters you want to know what all the hype is about when people lose their shit about where is Half-Life 3 god damn it
5244941	5249186	Play this and figure out, oh, okay, I can see why I'd want more of this.
5249446	5252329	But do keep in mind the game is 12 years old at this point.
5252429	5252629	Yes.
5254076	5280659	but there's been newer versions there's a fan community project that's pretty much vaporware called Black Mesa Source which was, it's not related to Valve at all but Valve has absolutely given it it's given them their blessing a complete reskin of Half-Life with completely redrawn textures like a total remake of it that hasn't come out yet and it's been planned for like 5 or 6 years
5281542	5281822	All right.
5282383	5284364	Well, that's going to do it for our Classic Game of the Week this week.
5284604	5288067	Half-Life, released originally in 98 for the PC.
5288508	5289148	Get your crowbars.
5289508	5289748	All right.
5291810	5292110	All right.
5292130	5295973	We're going to take a quick break, guys, but we'll be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5296013	5296934	There's still more to come.
5296954	5301978	We've got some rapid-fire news coming your way, FUs of the Week, the mailbag, and more announcements and things of that sort.
5302358	5303219	So don't go anywhere, guys.
5303239	5306702	We'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

5385691	5386111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5404666	5404947	Umlautsf.com
5425124	5449079	I do ask if you are going to watch the hour and a half long pre-show for about the first 20 minutes just skip all the segments to have me until about 20 minutes in because unfortunately there was some audio snafu and I think I have a Jessica Simpson moment but you know what it's live things like that happen we've had our share of LOL WTF moments here on Orange Lounge Radio like remember when the entire soundboard fell over that was a good time
5449759	5455504	So anyhow, big thanks once again to Umlaut for asking me to be a part of that, including, of course, the wonderful Seg, who I think is in our chat room.
5455544	5456264	I saw him there earlier.
5456304	5456845	Hello, Seg.
5457385	5474218	And the other guys that put the pre-show together, the whole folks at the AV Society, very professional folks, and my fellow co-hosts on that show, Carnage and Wes, both from Destructoid, were great and did very well with all the interviews and everything.
5474258	5475999	So lots and lots of interviews and folks.
5476019	5476880	Okay.
5477060	5479542	Okay, so again, that's YouTube user UmlautSF.
5479622	5480702	And by the way, you can still donate.
5481403	5486626	So you can still, if you forgot, if you're like, oops, I meant to donate, but you know, December was a rough month.
5486666	5488087	Well, you can still donate.
5488547	5491609	So I don't think it'll go to this year's tally, but it will go to a good cause.
5491669	5493130	And that's the very important part.
5494028	5494208	All right.
5494228	5495890	Let's move on with some rapid fire news.
5495930	5498293	Some other game news going on there this week.
5498413	5498693	Loki.
5499514	5499734	Yes.
5500475	5503839	So let's start things off talking a little bit about Saints Row the Third.
5504199	5504820	This is kind of cool.
5504840	5511927	This is something that I know I heard about a while ago because it was announced by CheapAssGamer because it involves TPD.
5512007	5512568	But CheapAssGamer.
5512628	5513289	DarkSakura.com
5531346	5533728	You know, have the season pass.
5534049	5546479	Or you can get it for free using the Genki Bowl 7 viewer pack, which allows you to get all the DLC portions to be able to play co-op with someone that has that DLC if you choose not to buy it.
5548801	5557029	And, of course, the only catch is that you need to get to the point in the game where you're at the first save house, which doesn't take that long because that's when you get homies.
5557069	5557409	But, uh...
5558710	5560231	Even I'm at that point.
5560711	5563753	If I could play that long, if a game could hold my attention that long, you could do it too.
5563773	5567315	It's pretty awesome, and he does have a bunch of unique lines, apparently, in the game.
5568676	5569596	We got popcorn over here?
5570317	5570997	Would you like popcorn?
5571037	5572238	It's plain popcorn, though.
5572478	5572818	That's fine.
5573118	5573639	It's gross.
5573839	5574799	It's pretty bad popcorn.
5575440	5578401	I eat low-fat or the low-butter popcorn sometimes.
5579162	5582024	Of course, I couldn't find that at the store, so I have regular butter now.
5583920	5584180	All right.
5584460	5585101	Oh, wow, that is plain.
5585301	5586702	Yeah, apparently... You just sold the hell out of that.
5586722	5592206	From what I heard about CheapyD, I think he won some type of auction thing and did all that.
5592226	5592686	Oh, yeah, maybe.
5593087	5594388	Yeah, it was like a charity thing.
5594408	5597169	If I knew about that auction, I would have... He paid like $2,000.
5601944	5606667	I don't know if it made the news tonight because I think it might be kind of late breaking and I really apologize.
5606687	5608848	I'm like scanning over the upcoming stories.
5609549	5622156	There's rumors going around about THQ that apparently they're in trouble right now and they're selling off or something about all of the projects coming out in 2014 for THQ have been canceled and they're trying to prepare the company to be sold.
5622176	5624057	I don't think they're in trouble.
5625782	5626503	Yeah, pretty good.
5626783	5628364	I mean, where does a rumor like that come from?
5629045	5630346	An industry insider.
5630466	5633388	Well, I know that, but who would make something like that up?
5633888	5635089	That's a weird rumor to make up.
5636330	5637271	Well, it still weighs off.
5637331	5637511	I mean, 2014.
5637631	5639272	I mean, I don't know.
5639292	5641474	Maybe they're just... Who are they going to be bought by?
5641534	5641594	EA.
5644597	5645318	or Activision.
5646238	5646638	Who else?
5647539	5649100	Who else buys up gaming companies?
5649700	5653403	I don't see them going that way right now.
5654544	5657225	Hell, there's companies that have a worse time than they do.
5659847	5660987	Sometimes you get surprised.
5661167	5661708	PopCap.
5662228	5663268	Why did PopCap sell?
5663308	5664048	They were doing great.
5664208	5665549	I mean, look at Capcom.
5665589	5666989	Capcom didn't do that great.
5667029	5671770	I mean, they have Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, but I don't think that sold tons.
5671910	5673391	I mean, I don't know.
5673411	5675091	They didn't really have any big games.
5675691	5679352	I mean, Warner Brothers had Batman, so that helped, but they didn't have Batman.
5681573	5682193	Harry Potter?
5682413	5683193	Lego Harry Potter?
5684634	5685114	I don't think so.
5685494	5686134	All right, let's move on.
5688375	5689675	Alright, and some other cool stuff.
5690656	5691356	Dark Souls.
5691556	5695458	There's hopefully a chance that it'll be coming to PC.
5695838	5699300	And of course, the admin for the Dark Souls
5702294	5724924	They responded to a request for a PC version and basically said There's always a possibility to have games adapted on PC And the good news is Dark Souls is not a 100% typical console game So the option is possible Now to make things happen, let's say the demand has to be properly done Someone make a successful petition And so there is a petition right now, you can sign it
5725564	5735645	it has currently around 37,000 signatures and if it hits some arbitrary number then maybe there'll be a Dark Souls PC game
5737639	5737899	SILENT HILL
5762761	5765203	I'm sorry, March 13th.
5765323	5769967	And then the HD Collection will be coming out on March 6th.
5770488	5773971	And then on the Vita, Book of Memories will be coming out March 27th.
5775212	5779175	So it's a whole month full of Silent Hill, whether that be a good or bad thing.
5783018	5783319	Alright.
5784520	5786702	We talked a little bit about Silent Hill already earlier in the show.
5786802	5787463	What, another movie too?
5787483	5788444	Isn't there supposed to be another movie?
5788464	5791227	There's supposed to be another movie, but I mean... I thought they announced they were filming it.
5791267	5792509	The movie wasn't terrible.
5792549	5793970	The first one was alright.
5794471	5795472	I really liked the first movie.
5795492	5795972	Yeah.
5795992	5796653	It was good.
5797154	5797394	Just...
5799199	5806383	Man, the last game that they put out was not very good, and this one I'm not sure if it's going to be very good either.
5806744	5809725	And I don't know if, was it Frozen Memories?
5809805	5811106	Wasn't that one of the Wii?
5811186	5812467	I don't know if that was any good either.
5813447	5814168	It was a lot of running.
5815789	5816929	Alright, moving on.
5817990	5825474	This isn't necessarily about video gaming, but it's about a game that influences a lot of shit in video gaming, and that is Dungeons & Dragons.
5826074	5829776	There's some big news this week about Dungeons & Dragons that's a little bit controversial.
5831577	5856848	Wizards of the Coast is working on a new edition of Dungeons & Dragons which is kind of weird to me in a way like it seems like they're pumping these out faster than versions of Google Chrome all of a sudden like wasn't the original version of D&D in the 70s and then they had one in the 80s or like no when did second edition was all the way in the 90s there was D&D and then there was a D&D remember there was advanced and then they consolidated those two brands so there was a tricky other version in there yeah okay
5857348	5857528	D&D D&D D&D
5877788	5879389	User input, quote,
5894620	5898123	In short, we want a game that is as simple or as complex as you please.
5898523	5902266	It's action focused on combat, intrigue, and exploration as you desire.
5902687	5906550	We want a game that is unmistakably D&D, but one that can easily become your D&D.
5906850	5908511	The game that you want to run and play.
5908551	5911234	That is from their official announcement that they sent out earlier this week.
5911734	5920201	And they say, by involving you in the process, we can build a set of D&D rules that incorporate the wants and desires of D&D gamers around the world.
5920641	5926808	So, they are going to, I guess, at least are claiming that they're going to be user input in a lot of features of this game.
5927169	5929791	Wasn't there supposed to be a lot of user input in Mega Man Legends 3 too?
5929831	5930552	And look where that got.
5932294	5932875	Womp womp.
5934685	5935425	No, but I'm not.
5935645	5940928	You know, obviously D&D is a classic game, but it's going to be very interesting to see what direction it gets taken in.
5940948	5951513	I mean, you would think the people that play it regularly would know a lot, but sometimes, I don't know, like I go to World of Warcraft, which obviously heavily influenced by D&D, right?
5952373	5958376	World of Warcraft almost listened too much to its vocal fan base in this latest one.
5958416	5963498	Like Cataclysm really kind of catered to a lot of the very vocal people, and because of that, it's the weakest expansion.
5963678	5964238	D&D needs more T&A
5986545	5987106	I want to get drunk.
5987126	5988927	If there's any chicks there, I want to do them.
6007199	6007540	Mr. Sparkle
6022239	6033304	And what's interesting about that is that the components of the Mr. Sparkle achievement say, from stage one, make it to stage three bosses in survival mode within the Japanese ROM.
6033784	6044009	So that is spoiling of sorts, the fact that in this Simpsons arcade game that's going to come out in 360, you're going to be able to play the original, or US, I guess, ROM, but you also get to play the Japanese ROM.
6045049	6051731	Apparently, the Japanese ROM has lower difficulty, more health items, more points, and the ability to jump while holding a weapon.
6052451	6053051	Very interesting.
6054051	6055152	So that's going to be in that release.
6055932	6058892	And lastly, kind of some rumors going around.
6058932	6059973	This is big, big rumors.
6060353	6064474	But apparently, Retro Studios, which is one of the big Nintendo developers, right?
6064514	6065394	What did Retro Studios do?
6065414	6065654	Didn't they...
6065834	6066154	Donkey Kong
6087771	6092452	I'm going to work on another project that I am super excited about.
6092593	6098514	I can't talk about it too much, but if all goes well, it might just be one of my crowning achievements as an artist.
6098814	6099735	It's another Zelda game.
6100915	6101295	You think?
6101775	6103556	Yeah, because they've already, you know...
6105701	6133717	they you know put forth some effort into making stuff for Mario Kart and I think that they were you know they've been commented about saying no hey we'd love to get our hands on Zelda I think it's a Zelda like spin-off or something like that new like type of Zelda game well Zelda or not it could be very interesting to see what this is because this could be that big announcement at E3 like here is what the core gamer is gonna want a Wii U for yeah but see here's the thing though
6135097	6137521	Remember when they said the same thing about Metroid Other M?
6137721	6138442	How did that do?
6139564	6141207	It just, like, tanked.
6142108	6142449	I mean, so...
6144381	6144841	I don't know.
6144981	6145342	I don't know.
6171138	6176407	And fuck, if you can't sell a Metroid game on a Nintendo system, you got problems.
6179291	6181274	Alright, let's move on with some more rapid fire news.
6181415	6181595	Alan.
6183891	6193278	For those who remember the XCOM franchise from the 90s, a company named Firaxis showed up at E3 last year saying that they were going to bring back the franchise.
6193598	6197782	I completely missed the XCOM train when I was in junior high and high school.
6198262	6203666	If you ever want, I have the entire XCOM collection I bought on Steam for like four bucks, which has like five XCOM games.
6204106	6205868	They were pretty awesome.
6205948	6206408	Old ones were.
6206428	6207289	The really old ones were.
6207600	6217428	So we haven't seen much about the FPS version of the XCOM game, or rather under the XCOM license that Firaxis is bringing back.
6217808	6222172	And that's because it's being pushed to 2013, has been cancelled.
6222232	6228697	I guess maybe they're having problems imagining how XCOM would function as an FPS, but they're still developing it, they just need more time.
6229377	6233801	However, the XCOM strategy reboot, which I guess is more...
6235882	6237523	Here's more to what XCOM originally was.
6237543	6239744	It's still on board for a 2012 release.
6240044	6242425	They've also renamed the game to XCOM Forever.
6243265	6243745	Go figure.
6244626	6247147	Okay, this has it here as XCOM Enemy Unknown.
6247387	6247867	It's a joke.
6247967	6249068	It's like Duke Nukem Forever.
6249948	6250429	I'm trolling.
6250809	6251249	I'm tired.
6251269	6252770	That was like a low-flying jet over my head.
6253230	6254751	It was a bad joke.
6254771	6256391	What's that going over me?
6261220	6270988	Also, so next quick fire story is there's a game that was put on Kickstarter, which is like, I have a great idea and please fund my project.
6271028	6274150	I only need five grand and me and my friend will design this and blah, blah, blah.
6275411	6281595	A game called Oregon Trail, not Oregon the state, but Oregon like a kidney.
6281895	6284617	Oregon Trail Director's Cut, a success on Kickstarter.
6284637	6285398	Yeah.
6285938	6298041	So it's going to be a zombie-filled spoof of the Oregon Trail where I guess you've got a map and you're trying to survive getting from point A to point B. A destination where, of course, the big stronghold is that is keeping the zombies out.
6298741	6301582	And they met their Kickstarter goal.
6301922	6306503	So hopefully that will be developed and released and everyone will have a grand old time.
6307783	6314765	And this image here, it looks like they've got some pixelated Sean from Shaun of the Dead and some of the characters from Zombieland in sort of a...
6316927	6318008	Turn left, you moron.
6338527	6343308	And it looks like the files should work with the Garmin Mobile XT units.
6344509	6348070	I was thinking maybe it might be TomTom because they're the huge sort of standalone GPS.
6348090	6355092	Yeah, I thought for sure that TomTom would because they have a ton of voices like you get James Earl Jones and Samuel Jackson.
6355412	6356932	Yeah, this here has lists.
6358993	6360273	There's a Samuel Jackson.
6360293	6361853	Yes, there is a Samuel Jackson.
6361913	6362934	Left, motherfucker!
6363054	6363774	Can you do it?
6364314	6365534	Seriously, that is it.
6368834	6373538	There's Mr. T. There's got to be a Macho Man Savage one.
6374698	6375239	I don't know.
6375519	6376800	Go straight six miles.
6376900	6377561	Oh, yeah.
6378341	6378782	Let's see.
6380123	6381844	Destination on the left, boy.
6382645	6384486	No, I know they have like a Darth Vader one.
6385166	6385887	TomTom Voices.
6385907	6386407	Let's see here.
6386648	6387008	Wow.
6387808	6389670	You know, I kind of need a GPS.
6389690	6389990	Here you go.
6390030	6390370	Here you go.
6390731	6391691	Marge Simpson.
6392272	6394313	That's one of the newest ones that they're highlighting.
6394333	6394874	Yeah.
6395703	6396984	Now I kind of want a GPS.
6397004	6397825	That might be kind of fun.
6398045	6401207	Homer Simpson, Roger Moore, Kim Cattrall, Kit.
6401487	6402328	Kim Cattrall?
6402508	6403148	Kim Cattrall.
6403168	6406871	Why the fuck would you want Kim Cattrall doing your... Yoda.
6407091	6408532	It's just her howling from Porky's.
6408612	6411054	Even my mother would be like, the fuck is this?
6412175	6419800	Yoda, Han Solo, SpongeBob SquarePants, C-3PO, Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, Dory the Explorer, Darth Vader.
6421321	6422842	Where are some of the other funny ones here?
6423623	6424643	Who the fuck is that?
6424663	6424704	Uh...
6428461	6430203	Man, I don't even know.
6430283	6430923	Burt Reynolds.
6431224	6432425	I've heard the Burt Reynolds one.
6432985	6434066	Billy Connolly.
6434947	6435627	Dennis Hopper.
6435887	6436608	Alright, anyway.
6436648	6438049	Dennis Hopper's been dead how long?
6438790	6443573	If you have a Garmin Mobile XT, I guess any of them, there's a whole line of them.
6444194	6447537	Go under Reddit and look this up because it was posted to Reddit.
6447557	6449118	I guess it's Reddit people that...
6449468	6451189	There are a lot of dead people on there.
6475712	6477374	and some people that should be dead.
6479836	6480397	You're mean.
6481498	6493030	But anyways, CES, they showed off a few things, obviously a lot of TVs, including some new smart TVs or web-enabled TVs that have Gaikai and on-live support.
6494191	6504060	and Gaikai of course coming to some brand new LG TVs and you'll be able to stream games straight to the TV using the interface on there.
6504360	6512828	Also coming to Google TVs would be on live service and I'm guessing they'll allow you to
6513348	6521435	purchase the universal controller and stream stuff straight to the TV, which you have to use their player app for that.
6523116	6534086	No word on what other devices maybe the stuff will be coming to, but it's kind of neat that someday you'll be able to get TVs that stream games straight to them.
6535547	6537909	And I mean, if you think about it, you know,
6539398	6549471	Really, these consoles, if you will, will never go away because they just keep updating the hardware on their end and they can keep running all the new games.
6549812	6551254	You never have to buy a new console again.
6552115	6554618	Well, until the resolution gets really better.
6554878	6555679	It's very interesting.
6555700	6559966	This is a very interesting direction, having the consoles directly built into the TVs, essentially.
6560006	6569842	I mean, I realize these are kind of different, still kind of growing things, but how long before Microsoft puts out their own TV with a built-in Xbox and Kinect is right in the top of the TV on these two little cameras?
6570362	6572743	Well, even on top of that, I could see that in the next three years.
6572763	6575964	What if all the console manufacturers go streaming?
6576164	6578785	Then you don't need to buy the console.
6579205	6581045	You can play Twisted Metal, and then you can play Fable.
6581125	6585307	You can play Resistance and Dance Central.
6585387	6587667	I mean, it's all on one thing.
6588928	6589708	Could be very interesting.
6590356	6591217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6606654	6612456	There's no way to download entire games and all that.
6612476	6621399	It's still kind of a ways away before these huge epic games that fill a Blu-ray we really download right into our homes all the time.
6621839	6622359	You know what I mean?
6622859	6631062	So I think the next generation of games is still going to have a physical-based format, but two generations from now, this is what we could be looking at.
6631602	6638964	I think a lot of people thought we would be a download only at this point, but as far as Gaikai and OnLive are concerned, I guess we are.
6642704	6646305	Would this be a feature that would interest you in a TV at all, guys?
6646625	6647745	Or is this just, eh, whatever?
6648425	6649966	It's more, eh, whatever for me.
6650846	6653547	I mean, it's a neat technology for sure.
6655287	6655487	Alan?
6657047	6658608	We might be in the market for a new TV soon.
6658648	6660068	Is this something we should look to get?
6660328	6660468	Yeah.
6663045	6670831	Alright, well moving on, something that may be built in that you don't want so much, I don't know, we'll see.
6671252	6676176	But Mass Effect 3, of course, is coming out on PC as well as the various consoles.
6676596	6680639	But Mass Effect 3 on the PC, it will require Origin.
6680659	6681260	Origin.
6681500	6697465	It will not work on Steam As you know, EA and Valve are in a little bit of a quarrel right now Alan, you look like you're dying to comment on that situation Yeah, they're having a Wang contest Get out the ruler, boys What does it all boil down to?
6698804	6708253	Um, the fact that EA is not only are they a publisher and developer like Valve is, but they are also a medium of commerce distribution.
6708554	6716762	So now we have two storefronts like, I don't know, Target and Walmart or Macy's and Penny's that offer the same thing.
6716782	6720145	And then they're just having a cockfight over distribution.
6720165	6720245	Yeah.
6720305	6722427	Here's how EA puts it in their press release.
6739522	6742383	And I believe it's the whole fact that when you have a game on Steam, patches come through Steam.
6742443	6743303	And EA doesn't want that.
6756947	6775123	also this happened Dragon Age 2 which I mentioned during my gaming week that I'm playing I had to install Origins to get DA2 digitally it was on Steam for a couple months this was a big story like last year and it was on Steam and they took it down because Valve and Steam had a problem with how EA handled the DLC basically what it means is
6776444	6793653	if you buy a game on Steam Valve wants you to be able to buy DLC for it through the game itself like you load the game and then through the game interface you can buy DLC or buy the DLC a la carte via Steam with Dragon Age 2 you had to go to EA's website
6795234	6797896	So Valve wasn't doing the transaction.
6798296	6804260	Like you weren't actually doing the credit card transaction through Steam and they didn't like that.
6804961	6807002	So that's what got DA2 kicked off of Steam.
6807662	6812446	So now EA is basically saying we are making the game and we have a store so you have to buy it through our store.
6812926	6817669	Well now they are swearing up and down but even if you don't buy it in the Origin store you have to install Origin.
6817969	6819050	That's another big thing.
6819070	6820351	That's what Half-Life 2 did.
6820531	6821132	That's true.
6821172	6821612	But here you go.
6822332	6825153	Now they are saying, they're swearing Origin's not spyware.
6825213	6829714	Quote, Origin is not spyware and does not use or install spyware on users' machines.
6830174	6841417	In order to allow Origin to install games and their patches for everyone to use, Origin implements a permission change that results in Windows, not Origin, reviewing the file names in the program data slash Origin folder.
6841817	6845498	This is an ordinary Windows function, not an information gathering process.
6846138	6850619	So basically they're trying to say, we swear we're not spying on you, we just want to get our store on your computer.
6851778	6856939	Now to be fair, as Alan mentioned, this is what Valve did several years ago and it pissed people off then.
6856999	6865321	To activate your CD key and your license for Half-Life 2, the biggest sequel of the year at the time in 2004, you had to install this bullshitty Steam store?
6865381	6866201	What the fuck is this?
6866261	6867202	I just want to play Half-Life 2.
6867502	6873623	And of course the servers were overwhelmed at the time because it was unprecedented, but yeah.
6873903	6881585	Now, I hope I'm saying this name right in our chatroom, but it's Ahamkara, and our chatroom says, Steam is better, and I have more games there already, so they win.
6881745	6882365	End of story.
6882565	6883445	Origin can suck it.
6884025	6888647	And I think that's the way a lot of people kind of feel right now, is that it's like, I don't want another store.
6889387	6900990	This is very similar to what Loki was talking about probably an hour ago with the whole movie stuff, probably at the top of the show, with that whole fact that Warner Brothers wants to force people to use Ultraviolet, and I'm like, people don't want that.
6901290	6902170	They don't want...
6903470	6905852	One store focused on one company.
6906652	6910234	And the consumer is going to lose in this because there's going to be all these different stores.
6910254	6911695	It's like, I don't want all these fucking stores on my computer.
6911715	6913076	Here's the thing, though.
6914217	6920381	They think that people are either going to buy it at retail or wait 56 days to watch it.
6920481	6922262	They're not going to want to rent it.
6922382	6924043	Or they're going to stream it via their service.
6925664	6926524	Or they'll pirate it.
6926544	6927245	Or they'll pirate it.
6927445	6928205	They will pirate it.
6928245	6929206	That's what's going to happen.
6930327	6930587	I mean...
6932071	6946204	And for those wondering if they have Mass Effect 1 and 2 digital deluxe editions, which were available and are still available via Steam, if they can import your save games, because the plot is continuous through the third, because it's a trilogy, the whole story is going to wrap up with Mass Effect 3.
6946624	6955372	Yes, of course, if you have the previous two games, even through Steam, it will sniff your save game file and Mass Effect 3 will continue with the choices your character has made.
6955572	6977038	your version of Shepard so again and if you know if EA doesn't want Steam to sell it then it's it's not you know there it's not going to be on Steam if you really if this Origin thing pisses you off even if you go to Best Buy and buy a hard box copy of it at a store real store it's going to put Origin on your system there's no way to get around this unless you go to
6978274	6978955	A crack site.
6979155	6984959	But to be fair, exactly what Half-Life 2 did six or seven years ago.
6985239	6986940	But there were also cracked versions of Half-Life 2.
6987941	6988421	That's true.
6988661	6990102	And I think that's what's going to happen here.
6992384	6994785	All these companies think they know what gamers want.
6995266	6996927	Gamers want to be left the fuck alone.
6997007	6998728	That's what a lot of gamers want.
7000069	7000369	Anyhow.
7000890	7007254	Alright, we're going to take a moment to, you know, we say it's the show where every gamer has a voice, and one way we interact with you guys is through our email bag.
7007575	7008836	You guys send us emails every week.
7009916	7015941	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And DarkSakura will usually dive in the mailbag and read your emails, but she's not here.
7016501	7017542	I thought I read these beforehand.
7048568	7076338	um now what the hell we only have two emails tonight right what the hell so the backstory about this before I jump into the email and if you have a problem with this just don't be an ass in chat because Jamie would probably kick you and I would kick you too in her place so that's how I'm going to step up and be DarkSakura tonight um the Girl Scouts allow transgender girls into their into a certain chapter um
7076878	7084884	If the parents present them as a girl and, you know, they go by a girl name, they can be in the Girl Scouts even though they were born biologically something else.
7085244	7091088	There's a huge, there's a right wing, you know, people within the Girl Scouts that have a huge problem with this.
7092208	7098873	And they're asking that people not buy Girl Scout cookies until these children are thrown out.
7099113	7101254	Just so you know, Alan, I think our listeners are pretty smart.
7102355	7103276	Nobody's going to have a problem.
7103716	7105878	I know, but it's just... We all think that bitch is crazy.
7106018	7106298	Yeah.
7106878	7119142	So now people who are supportive of the transgender kids or girls being in the Girl Scouts are hearing about this boycott and they're like, I fucking want to buy cookies because this sounds awesome.
7119222	7123644	It's access to different types of people.
7124344	7126185	So here's the email after all that backstory.
7126925	7137350	Dear Personi, after reading DarkSakura's Tumblr post about the Girl Scout cookie boycott, I did what I usually do in response to these kinds of right-wing protests.
7137830	7143053	I sought out a way to do the exact opposite of what those I completely disagree with tell me not to do.
7144173	7151335	Being antisocial and not having nieces who are currently Girl Scouts, I searched to see if I could buy Girl Scout cookies online.
7151856	7153396	However, I was not able to find any.
7153976	7160378	In fact, according to the link at the end of this email, Girl Scouts of America does not allow their cookies to be sold online.
7160619	7161579	My question is why?
7162318	7170325	There are a great number of shut-ins that are yearning for the kind of awesome Samoan goodness that they cannot possibly get on any Samoan porn site.
7171686	7181534	These people have loads of excess income that can be easily spent on fundraisers that fund the instilling freedom and independence into the mind of young girls across this great land.
7181614	7190461	Without programs such as the ones done by the Girl Scouts of America, more women may become shut-ins like the men that could potentially fund the GSA.
7191802	7199027	I urge everyone to urge the Girl Scouts of America to allow the sale of Girl Scout cookies online.
7199347	7202009	I don't know how to do that for I Am Too Busy playing Skyrim.
7203570	7205591	Stay black, Redertainment.
7206233	7207274	Um, here's the thing.
7207334	7222250	I think the reason why they don't want you to buy them online is keep in mind that, you know, the whole stuff they're trying to teach in the Girl Scouts, I think is part of the whole like going out and, you know, they want the girls to be able to, you know, get out in the community and sell them.
7222610	7225693	And I think, you know, even though you make the case, I don't want to leave my house.
7226894	7229635	The problem is they want the Girl Scouts to leave the house to do this.
7229695	7236598	It's to teach the Scouts customer service and how to count money and how to run a budget and blah, blah, blah.
7236678	7237219	Exactly.
7237339	7240840	So for that, I mean, you don't have the girls in a factory doing all this.
7240900	7241640	I mean, maybe, I don't know.
7241981	7243541	But, you know, they're not going to learn as much from that.
7243581	7246062	I think it's about being out there in the community, being visible.
7246102	7248343	That's why they're out in the grocery stores and things like that.
7248363	7253866	Because, you know, Red Entertainment, at some point, you're going to have to get out of the house and go get groceries.
7253946	7254786	I mean, well, then again...
7255146	7256827	and they're usually parked out at Safeway.
7277972	7280714	If they open up online ordering... Oh, goddamn case.
7280874	7281354	Oh, God.
7282755	7289558	Because they only make a certain amount a year because, you know, they give the boxes to whatever the chapters are in each state.
7289658	7291780	They go out to the little suburbs.
7292840	7297623	They would have to make a shitload more cookies and they would have to do fulfillment and how to ship it and pricing and blah, blah, blah.
7297703	7301505	So it's really just about the scouts going out into the community and selling cookies.
7301585	7302786	And I don't think that's going to change.
7303086	7303226	Mm-hmm.
7303886	7309210	It'd be nice, but if they sold them online, there'd be no point in setting up the little tables and irritating you.
7310859	7314261	So, I mean, but to be... Irritating you.
7314281	7322987	I always buy the Girl Scout cookies because, like, you know, when I... You know, for me, usually, it's kind of like, you know, I'll be walking in stores and the Girl Scouts are here and like, would you like to buy Girl Scout cookies?
7323027	7325008	I'm like, fucking yeah.
7325029	7327430	Yeah, I'll have... Fuck yeah, I want Girl Scout cookies.
7327930	7329171	Thank you for being here.
7329812	7330472	Oh, my God.
7330532	7332854	I miss Samoas so much or whatever they're called now.
7334235	7335516	So... Thin Mints all the way.
7336176	7336956	And the peanut butter ones.
7337297	7337697	Get out.
7338237	7338518	All right.
7341659	7343640	That email had nothing to do with video games.
7343881	7347162	Well, I guess sometimes people eat Girl Scout cookies while playing video games, so there you go.
7347242	7347422	Yeah.
7347582	7347863	All right.
7350184	7350744	Hi, folks.
7351665	7354546	Sorry, I've got to read this comment from our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
7355306	7360469	SSJ100Matt says, so it will be like EverQuest and we can type slash Girl Scout cookies.
7362210	7363491	Can you still do that in EverQuest?
7363511	7364791	EverQuest 2 went free.
7364811	7367393	They had the Pizza Hut or the Roundtable plug-in, right?
7367413	7368093	Yeah, slash pizza.
7368473	7370876	Oh god, that was like a running gag on OLR for a year.
7370896	7372157	It was the whole slash pizza thing.
7373058	7374080	I wonder if they still do that.
7374780	7376643	Because, you know, EverQuest went free to play and all that.
7376783	7376963	Yeah.
7377243	7377744	It's awesome.
7379656	7383538	Hi folks, I listened to last night's show today, enjoyed it as always.
7383938	7385739	I have to chip in on this open discussion.
7386420	7388761	I think this blackout day has to happen.
7389381	7393644	Most people who are not plugged into the geek community have no concept of what it is or what it means.
7394464	7399006	What's worse is because the media wants it in the news networks are not bringing it to the forefront.
7403889	7410433	I wouldn't wait until the 23rd, but do it on the 20th to allow for the desired backlash against the bill to build.
7411174	7414756	This would also be too big of a story for the major news outlets to ignore.
7415477	7418639	What gets me the most is the congressman pushing it.
7419319	7424743	It is extremely dismissive of the critics, including internet and security experts, including Vincent Cerf.
7425383	7432908	It seems he doesn't care because the big media filling his coffers wants it, and the heck with representing his constituents or observing the Constitution.
7434032	7435726	Think about that next time you're at the ballot box.
7437658	7438318	All very good points.
7438398	7447440	Obviously there's been a lot of changes with SOPA just like over the weekend and it's coming up on our show a little later so if you haven't already heard I'll kind of clarify some of the developments with SOPA.
7447940	7452901	Long story short, it sounds like we're being heard and that's a great thing.
7453381	7454821	All the way at the top we're being heard.
7455741	7458022	President Obama put out a statement about it, right?
7458042	7459342	Yes, which we'll cover a little later.
7459542	7460102	Wink wink.
7462803	7465243	He's been known to say one thing and then all of a sudden, ha!
7466023	7489851	yeah so but I mean yeah so it's it's kind of one of those we've won the battle but not won the war type of thing because you know then the MPAA put out this whole thing about you know well it's all these thieves are just trying to win and da da da da da and it's kind of like take a chill pill the movie industry has been suffering not because of piracy but because the movies have been bad and that was take care signed Wendy that was from Wendy
7490211	7504354	or the fact that, you know what, when it costs $51 for three people to go see a movie that they could have rented at Blockbuster for $250, you know, it's like, there's the problem, Hollywood.
7504394	7505874	Get your head out of your butt.
7507075	7509935	Anyhow, we'll talk a little more about the SOPA updates a little later.
7510115	7511155	Those were our two emails.
7511535	7512276	Mailbag is over.
7512656	7515096	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

7524279	7527581	So get those Twitter topics locked in at twitter.com slash OLR.
7527601	7529403	You got about five more minutes to get those in.

7541030	7542151	We still have a few more stories.
7542571	7543912	Don't call just yet.
7544553	7549456	Actually, before we get to the stories, it's very important that we have our moment to rant.
7550196	7552579	It's a little segment we do here called the FUs of the week.
7552699	7553019	Why?
7553259	7553880	Because we can.
7569593	7570614	Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
7571341	7573803	Fuck you, the locksmith that fixed my car.
7574544	7586393	Because not only did you arrive two hours late, but you also drilled a hole into my ignition, which looks weird, and also left a bunch of metal shavings all over the floor of my car.
7586773	7587874	Didn't bother to fix that.
7588174	7588534	Thanks!
7589155	7590696	I'll definitely pass out your cards.
7593421	7595283	Alan, do you have any FUs of the week?
7596184	7610776	I'm a very finicky and light sleeper, so it doesn't matter how amazing and comfortable a sleeping arrangement is, if I've never slept there before, it's going to take me an hour or two to fall asleep, and I'm running on about two hours of sleep right now.
7611076	7613138	Aw, it doesn't help that I'm always elbowing you in the back here.
7613198	7613538	Yeah.
7613979	7617502	So, I'm so tired.
7617562	7622186	I've always loved, you know, pitching in to help co-host OLR, but I feel like I'm slurring my words.
7622226	7623847	That's how tired I am.
7624808	7628291	So... You're waking up every hour with a baby.
7628651	7629211	He has me.
7630392	7632514	I'm trying to read.
7632674	7634536	Alan, you're snoring.
7634816	7635497	Shut up.
7635577	7638159	I'm like, yeah, snoring, because I only snore when I'm exhausted.
7638279	7638459	So...
7639680	7640941	Yeah, I'm like trying to read emails.
7641582	7642222	Words.
7642563	7643603	I'm gonna fall asleep.
7643643	7649048	So yeah, F you to being tired and also just being a finicky, prissive sleeper.
7649348	7650789	Fair enough.
7651290	7653071	I don't really have a lot to be mad about.
7653151	7654833	I have a three-day weekend this weekend.
7654853	7655553	That's awesome.
7656034	7657195	Like, how can I be in a bad mood?
7657215	7658276	I don't have to go to work tomorrow.
7658476	7660938	I have the day off to do whatever I want.
7661468	7664829	F you to the fact that Alan is so tired that we won't be able to go anywhere in the morning.
7667731	7672673	But otherwise, I'm really pretty happy with a lot of things right now.
7673933	7677635	I was kind of tired earlier today, though, so F you to being really tired.
7678315	7681417	F you to the fact that I can't stay up as late anymore, it seems like.
7681897	7687340	Like, I used to be able to easy stay up for Rocky Horror and be up until 3.34 in the morning, but now I get fucking tired at like 12.31.
7687440	7688641	Is it because I'm old?
7689181	7689902	I think that's it.
7690102	7690422	Fuck!
7690562	7695565	And Disneyland is having a 24-hour day for Leap Day, February 29th, and it's like...
7697486	7700450	Ooh, we're working a ride Space Mountain at 4 in the morning.
7700490	7701271	It's gonna be fucking awesome.
7701311	7703214	And I'm like, how the hell am I gonna stay up until 4?
7703794	7704796	Jesus Christ.
7704856	7705356	Monster.
7705617	7708620	I never drink that kind of shit, but I'll do it for Disney.
7708640	7709782	24 hours of Disney.
7710283	7712145	And my clubbing days are over.
7712205	7713627	I don't do disco naps anymore.
7717810	7721551	When we started this show, we were ranting about getting into our mid-20s.
7721651	7723051	Now it's our mid-30s.
7724312	7724652	Wah.
7725252	7727792	All right, let's move on with some gaming news, Loki.
7728773	7730053	All right.
7730333	7734014	Let's talk a little bit about a witch hunt that was going on.
7734894	7740155	It's actually kind of funny because it was regarding Witcher 2 and people pirating the game.
7740656	7745737	I remember back a few months ago or so when CD Projekt said...
7746477	7752038	That they're going to be targeting pirates and they're going to be filing legal action against them.
7752678	7762260	And, you know, eventually they penned an open letter to the gaming community where they, you know, said they're going to stop doing that.
7762680	7767982	And, you know, apparently, though, they're still saying, you know, piracy hurts them.
7768402	7768982	But...
7772385	7772745	I don't know.
7772945	7774007	I don't know why they stopped.
7774187	7783196	I'm guessing that they had less good luck than they'd hoped finding the people that stole the stuff from them.
7783256	7788301	I would say it's either bad PR or realized it was going to cost them too much money.
7788341	7792926	Probably just one of those when they really thought about what they were doing, they realized it wasn't cost-effective.
7793709	7794189	or something.
7795050	7795530	I guess.
7795870	7801273	I'm kind of surprised they don't pursue one or two to make an example, but I don't know.
7801593	7810277	Maybe, or maybe, maybe, just crazy thought here, maybe it has something to do with they watched the whole internet backlash for GoDaddy.
7810697	7819041	I think a lot of people watched what happened with that whole thing where GoDaddy really got pressured by their customer to change their stance on SOPA and, you know,
7820081	7834633	obviously they were wrong on SOPA and they should have turned around but I mean it was really money talks in that case and I bet a lot of tech companies are looking at that going dude don't piss off the internet I mean after all it's they're they're the ones giving us money
7835173	7863038	here's the actual reason why they stopped basically it says our fans have always remained our greatest concern and we pride ourselves on the fact that you all know that we listen to you and take your opinions to heart while we are confident that no one who legally owns one of our games has been required to compensate us for copyright infringement we value our fans, our supporters and our community too highly to take the chance that we might even falsely accuse even one individual
7863738	7866959	So apparently there's a foolproof way of... A change of heart.
7867219	7873521	Well, you know, and in a way, what if the whole thing went to trial and so forth, and then it doesn't go their way?
7873801	7875741	I mean, maybe they're really afraid of that.
7875901	7877262	So, I mean, that could be part of it, too.
7878162	7878702	So, yeah.
7879522	7880042	All right, anyhow.
7880923	7881643	Moving on to...
7883069	7885891	Video Games Saving Lives Words with Friends
7906906	7909669	is a very popular iOS... It's fucking Scrabble.
7909769	7912011	Like, I know they're not allowed to say it's Scrabble.
7912431	7912791	It's Scrabble.
7912811	7913792	But it's fucking Scrabble.
7913932	7916655	Okay, Words with Friends is fucking Scrabble on the iPhone.
7917516	7919217	Words with Friends is like Bowl Cart.
7921459	7923881	And Scrabble is like Mario Kart.
7923961	7928045	Although they actually remembered to change Moo Moo Farm on the banner.
7928966	7931448	Like they would change the board in Words with Friends.
7931508	7931868	But anyway...
7932649	7936271	One of the deal about Words With Friends is that you could actually chat.
7936331	7937932	You could chat with people that you're playing with.
7937972	7939493	And I actually have friends that will play.
7939953	7941634	I don't like Words With Friends, personally.
7943274	7944695	You know why I don't like Words With Friends?
7944815	7945856	Because it's too easy to cheat.
7946616	7948797	It is way too easy because it's not a live game.
7949177	7950178	And I've been tempted to do this.
7950578	7952900	Go on Google and find an anagram finder.
7952920	7954421	Go on anagram.net or whatever it is.
7954701	7955622	It's even easier than that.
7955982	7956763	Yeah, seriously.
7957263	7963348	They have apps where you take a screen print of your words with friends and then you run it through the app and it tells you here's the best play.
7963768	7964208	I mean, it's like...
7965399	7978130	Now, I could play with people that I know wouldn't cheat, but like, I just, if I have the alerts on, my fucking phone goes off at 2.30 in the morning with some of my, you know, some of my friends stay up late or they're on different coasts or whatever.
7978170	7982313	So one of my friends on the East Coast will just be getting up for the day at 6 a.m.
7982333	7985436	and makes their play in words with friends and here I am fast asleep at 3 a.m.
7985976	7986477	Do-do-do-do-do.
7988158	7988839	and DarkSakura.com.
8004916	8011918	Well, anyway, I've been dragging this out, but long story short, there was a random match played in Word with Friends with these two folks.
8012279	8021582	One of them was an Australian, and one of them was here in Missouri, and they just got randomly matched up, but they were chatting with each other and I guess having a very nice conversation, which...
8022322	8040796	is almost newsworthy in itself ASL everybody I chat with on the internet that's usually a stranger is usually a dumbass like no offense you guys I'm talking about the strangers like if I play random online games with strangers like Uno or something like I get the biggest dumb fucks on the internet you know
8041636	8046317	So it's a miracle in one that civil people got together to play this game.
8047498	8058361	And then apparently this guy in Australia, Simon Fletcher, was playing Words with Friends and he started complaining in the chat, I've been having chest pains and whatever.
8058661	8061182	I don't know, how does that even fucking come up in chat?
8062882	8067144	You just played the word heartburn for 45 points.
8067284	8069005	Sorry, I'm replying so low.
8069526	8072807	I'm typing with one hand because my arm is having shooting.
8073868	8076509	I can't use my right arm right now because I'm having shooting pain.
8076629	8077990	How does that even come up in a random chat?
8078050	8078350	I don't know.
8078370	8078731	Whatever.
8079151	8080331	But they've been talking about it.
8080551	8083753	And Beth Legler was the opponent.
8084554	8086615	And they were playing against Beth.
8086915	8088696	I guess Simon and his wife were playing against Beth.
8089216	8091939	and Beth, luckily, was married to a doctor.
8092519	8098105	So kind of told her husband about, oh, well, I've been playing with this guy in Australia, but he's telling me da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
8098685	8101368	And the guy, the doctor said, you know what?
8101568	8103690	Simon needs to go to a hospital immediately.
8104170	8109095	And sure enough, when he finally went to the hospital, he had a 99% blockage near his heart.
8109976	8112078	So it was right to tell the guy to go to a hospital.
8112518	8117021	Now, I get with this whole video game saving lives thing or whatever.
8117181	8121583	I think that part of it's obviously getting blown out of proportion, just like Loki was rolling his eyes at the beginning of the story.
8122103	8127006	This was more about guys being fucking stubborn when it comes to going to the doctor.
8128827	8130348	Let's be real.
8130408	8132709	A lot of you probably are guys.
8133270	8135771	Those few ladies that are out there listening, I know there's a few of you.
8136171	8143075	How many of you know guys that are too stubborn to go to the doctor because they don't want to admit something's wrong with them or they don't want to admit they're getting old or whatever it is?
8144316	8150119	I think this is more a fact that, honey, a doctor is telling me you need to go to the hospital.
8150359	8152220	You're going to go to the fucking hospital.
8153641	8161910	I know someone whose dad had a minor incident and it turned out to be serious, but he also hadn't set foot in a doctor's office in almost 30 years.
8164028	8165388	That's crazy.
8165408	8172091	And his attitude was, you don't see doctors because nothing exists until they find it, and that's when you're sick.
8172231	8174571	So if you don't go to the doctor, they won't find you.
8175192	8179033	I realize some people avoid the doctor due to, well, not having insurance.
8179413	8181574	That's a whole other Oprah I'm not going to get into.
8182074	8186155	Or they avoid the doctor maybe because of religious reasons, I guess.
8186275	8192197	But for real, if neither of those apply to you and you're just being fucking stubborn, like, go.
8195717	8196738	Don't you want to be healthy?
8197598	8197918	All right.
8199600	8199900	Anyhow.
8201061	8203622	So, yay words with friends bringing people together.
8205303	8209526	This could have been about a 1997 AOL chat room.
8209606	8210167	You know what I mean?
8211487	8211828	Whatever.
8212448	8213469	All right, moving on, Alan.
8214730	8222675	So, CES just happened, and usually that's a big electronics and hardware gadgetry event.
8223135	8227962	Not so much for the gaming, that's mostly saved of course for Tokyo Game Show and E3 and all that.
8228423	8239698	However, the biggest gaming related thing that came out of CES most likely is the Project Fiona gaming touchscreen tablet by a company called Razer, the E-R-A-Z-E-R.
8241220	8269174	and I must admit looking at the pictures of this thing it looks like a very sexy device it looks well made it's sleek and it's going to run an Intel Ivy Bridge Core i7 processor it's going to have three axis tilt gyro functionality a magnetometer accelerometer force feedback it's going to vibrate Dolby 7 surround sound with built in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
8270234	8276196	and Razer CEO Minliang Tan explains, we are looking to change the whole perception of tablets.
8276716	8286080	This first of its kind PC gaming tablet with integrated dual controllers is definitely not for playing casual games about unhappy birds or zombie killing flora.
8286120	8287080	Ooh, throw in shade.
8287780	8289061	Throw in shade at the iPhone games.
8289781	8291962	Imagine a black iPad.
8292691	8293011	and DarkSakura.
8309521	8309861	and so on.
8328266	8328506	It'll be $999.99.
8329487	8339016	And this thing looks awesome, and it's like, alright, it's PC gaming on a tablet, and it's touchscreen, it's got all this cool shit, but where's the market?
8339056	8349685	Because if you have that kind of money to drop on something like this, you can get a very competent gaming laptop that is a fucking laptop, and you can do laptop shit on it.
8349966	8351847	That laptop you're using right now, I bought for $400.
8353889	8361233	Well over two years ago, because I was with my ex at the time, and so it was probably about three years old, and that cost me $400.
8361733	8363374	That will run Warcraft Cataclysm on it.
8363674	8368536	Yeah, not low settings, but you can play on it, yeah.
8368576	8370697	Yeah, so, I mean, imagine what $1,000 now would get you, you know?
8372158	8376441	So the display on it is 10.1 inches diagonal viewable.
8377082	8378743	Resolution is 1280 by 800.
8379603	8382305	I'm going to post a link of this into chat.
8382625	8384186	It looks like an awesome device.
8384266	8387208	It's great that they're trying to make this, but where's the market?
8387628	8389290	Who is this for?
8389350	8393692	I have to agree with this point that Cinderwolf said in our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com.
8393712	8398456	Cinderwolf says, did he just say 7.1 surround sound on a tablet?
8398476	8398716	Yeah.
8399136	8401258	Thank you for watching!
8417473	8423237	Unless you've got, you're like on Amtrak and you've got these backpacks like, oh, these are my speakers, yo, and you're setting them up.
8423297	8423638	I don't know.
8423658	8428001	Or you have like Uber headphones that can emulate it really fucking well, you know?
8428601	8429342	It might be a bit much.
8429422	8432804	Yeah, so the Dolby 7-1 chip and firmware is in there at least.
8432864	8433585	But yeah, exactly.
8433645	8436207	If you've got the speakers, then you're probably in your house.
8436987	8437968	You can play on your desktop.
8438468	8466021	it looks like a hot little device maybe mom is always on the desktop playing words with friends with people in Australia so maybe that's why I need a tablet it also sounds like because this tablet is so streamlined that it's going to be able to churn out max settings graphics on this little tablet that a PC where you always have to upgrade your graphics card every two years and it sounds like this is just a total monster visually on how it's going to render games but who's going to buy it?
8466961	8468464	Loki, is this something that interests you?
8468824	8469485	Fuck no.
8470486	8471007	Why not?
8471027	8472229	It's too damn expensive.
8472349	8474813	Now, I was trying to find out.
8475474	8476175	They have...
8478769	8485910	This seriously makes me think, like, I'm surprised Loki doesn't try to build his own version of this for half as much.
8486010	8486590	No, no.
8487911	8488511	Don't get me wrong.
8489211	8491351	What's in it is pretty powerful.
8491391	8495712	It's got a Core i7 inside of it and a bunch of other, you know, fancy shit.
8496332	8499433	And the form factor's nice, but it looks ridiculous.
8499633	8501733	I mean, it's not portable at all.
8501853	8503333	It's as portable as a laptop is.
8503393	8505814	And honestly, just buy a fucking laptop and a controller.
8505834	8506054	I mean...
8506894	8507675	It's pretty much it.
8507895	8509855	And the price point is just ridiculous.
8510296	8520560	I was trying to find, remember they had, this is the company that wanted to do that, Switchblade, which was the portable MMO system that was going to revolutionize everything.
8520920	8530383	And then that kind of flopped, and then they came out with this really fucking expensive keyboard, which I cannot find for the life of me, but I swear that keyboard's like 300 bucks.
8531984	8548637	all I have to say though is that you know we're near probably within a month of the next iPad announcement right that should come late January February if by some I mean we all know the next iPad has to fucking be high def has to right and the rumors are swelling and all that stuff it's gonna be more powerful
8549625	8566182	If Apple finally decides, maybe now is the time To finally put some type of attachment on the iPad That gives tangible game controls This thing should not even bother coming out It's fucking dead already Like, not to sound all Apple fanboy, but let's be real
8567163	8590921	and with the tablet and the two you know move like Sony move like gaming sticks I am interested in how those gaming sticks with the thumb you know thing translates mouse controls but what if you want to play a first-person shooter you need the WASD and the keyboard and stuff so even then even now this tablet looks like it's gonna limit the experience of the PC games that a laptop or PC would give you so
8594331	8595172	It's also like $1,000.
8595612	8596472	Yeah.
8597513	8601836	I mean, you can spend $1,000 on a laptop and get a nice laptop.
8602496	8602677	Yeah.
8603817	8604137	All right.
8604678	8610882	Well, let's move on with a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8611022	8611262	Loki.
8611763	8615685	And also, by the time it actually does come out, there's going to be something better and cheaper.
8615925	8617907	I mean, fuck.
8618067	8618967	Switch Play never came out.
8619528	8622770	That was shown on E3, I think, last year, or CES or some shit.
8623270	8623751	Okay, sorry.
8624291	8627253	Anyway, so let's talk a little bit about successful franchises.
8627373	8634058	And one successful franchise, which I'm just surprised every day in how successful it is, Just Dance.
8634379	8641344	And Just Dance 3 sold 7 million copies already worldwide, and that's from October.
8641944	8648088	And of course, the series itself has moved 25 million units.
8649188	8653371	I would definitely say that the music franchise is not dead, or at least Just Dance isn't dead.
8654872	8660655	So, Konami, DDR, when have you moved 25 million units ever?
8661236	8662897	Or 7 million units ever?
8663077	8664998	How does Just Dance 3 compare to Dance Central 2?
8666525	8667646	It's a different type of game.
8667726	8671308	Dance Central 2 is more of learning the actual dance steps.
8671728	8675491	Whereas Just Dance, the whole Just Dance series is more of mimicking what's on screen.
8675511	8677512	You remember when you watched me play that ABBA game?
8677652	8678553	Oh, yeah.
8678573	8680274	Where you're holding the thing.
8681114	8682695	Imagine that to Katy Perry songs.
8682835	8683936	That's Just Dance.
8684376	8688018	What I meant was the units sold.
8688419	8688919	The sales.
8689599	8689899	Oh, yeah.
8689919	8692021	They're far and beyond Dance Central 2.
8692639	8696482	Well, yeah, because Dance Central 2 is Kinect, and everyone, of course, has a fucking Wii, so that makes sense.
8697042	8704068	But I want to say that I would be willing to bet that Just Dance 3 on the Kinect is probably outsold Dance Central 2.
8704628	8711894	Which, I don't know, I haven't played Just Dance 3 specifically, but Dance Central 2 is so good, like, it's kind of sad.
8711914	8718279	I'll have to look up the numbers, but yeah, I'd be willing to bet that they've probably beat them out.
8719557	8721458	All right, while you look that up, don't interrupt me.
8721498	8722419	Wait till I'm done with the story.
8722499	8728742	But I want to close out today before we get to the Skype line with some more of those updates on SOPA.
8729623	8731244	Obviously, the Stop Online Piracy Act.
8732124	8739028	There has been, and since that email was sent in and since last week's show, there has been quite a bit of change going on with this.
8739668	8748914	And for one, the SOPA sponsor, Lamar Smith, came out and said he's going to pull the DNS blocking provisions from the bill.
8749054	8749314	Quote,
8749714	8760778	After consultation with industry groups across the country, I feel we should remove domain name system blocking from the Stop Online Piracy Act so that the committee can further examine the issues surrounding this provision.
8761178	8764840	So, you know, that was obviously one of the big controversial things was the whole blocking of websites.
8765340	8766981	That getting taken out of the bill.
8767421	8773823	Now, also over the weekend, the Obama administration, as pretty much has already been brought up earlier in the show, but I had it listed here, so whatever.
8774403	8778445	The Obama administration basically came out against the bills in their current form.
8779025	8799336	saying, in a nutshell, I'm going to really try my best to summarize this, they support that foreign websites and piracy and all this needs to be stopped, but not at the cost of censoring lawful activity and must not, as they say in the release, inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small.
8799736	8801197	So in other words, they don't want to see
8801957	8809381	sites get shut down by corporations because of flaw wording in this bill, which is kind of where I think a lot of us are at.
8810862	8813263	I can see that they need to do something about foreign websites.
8813283	8815024	They need to do something about fucking spam.
8815685	8816245	You know what I mean?
8816545	8818406	That shit is annoying, but how do you stop it?
8818847	8819927	I don't know if there's an easy answer.
8820027	8822869	I really don't think there's an easy answer to stopping that kind of stuff.
8823171	8824512	Good filters on your email?
8824532	8825513	Maybe.
8840965	8842646	That's just kind of where I'm at.
8842726	8848149	You can kind of spoof a lot of that now, but maybe they need to change the system that uses encryption verification.
8848689	8855793	I guess any of that could get hacked by people, but there's got to be something where there's more accountability from the original center and it's easier to track.
8856093	8856513	You know what I mean?
8857574	8875266	Okay, so Just Dance and Dance Central 2 Now Dance Central 2 has been out a lot less Well, a few weeks less It's only been out 11 weeks Whereas Just Dance 3 has been out for 14 weeks Just Dance 3 is at 993,191 units That's only in the US And Dance Central 2 is at 930,858 units
8885592	8901274	So they're slightly ahead, but they've been out for three more weeks Interesting, okay, well that's good to know Although, for it to be noted, this chart, which was from last week Dance Runs Rule 2 is in the 17th spot, whereas Just Dance 3 is in the 20th spot Well, that's good
8902386	8904688	Well, I mean, I'm not hating on Just Dance 3.
8904908	8905828	I mean, it's a decent game.
8905969	8907169	That's straight on the 360.
8907209	8908991	That's not all platforms.
8909191	8909451	Okay.
8910051	8911653	All right, let's open up the Skype line.
8911693	8912213	It's that time.
8912233	8920359	We're going to open up the Skype line now and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8921039	8925487	While we wait for those calls to come in because there is a little bit of a delay, we have just a couple tweets tonight.
8925547	8926989	Not a lot, but we do have a couple.
8927550	8929633	So let me get to some of those tweets right now.
8929754	8933500	I just want to make sure there wasn't anything earlier in the week that I missed here.
8935907	8937989	I guess not anything I'm catching off the top of my head.
8938029	8938589	I apologize.
8939050	8939750	I'm going to be honest.
8939810	8944214	If you tweet us on Sunday, you have a much better chance of getting read than tweeting us on Monday after the show.
8944514	8947656	Because sometimes I lose those amongst... We get a lot of spam tweets, too.
8947696	8948737	I have to filter through.
8949578	8953100	Anyway, we'll start with a tweet from Spazinator on Twitter.
8953160	8958625	Tweets us and says, Will there be another marathon or fuck show anytime soon?
8959885	8960686	Fuck show, no.
8960746	8962547	That was a one-time thing.
8962567	8963008	That's done.
8963648	8965989	A marathon show, yes.
8966069	8967049	We've been talking about it.
8967089	8967949	We just don't know when.
8968009	8971070	Tonight would have been a great night for that, but just too much other stuff going on.
8971591	8976152	So it may not be until there's another long weekend, which for me isn't until... I don't have a long weekend.
8976252	8977592	Which for me isn't until Memorial Day.
8977613	8978653	Do you get President's Day off?
8979053	8979273	Nope.
8979553	8980073	Interesting.
8980673	8983554	See, I don't get President's Day off, but I do get Martin Luther King Day off.
8983574	8984295	We don't get any of those.
8984535	8984935	Interesting.
8985555	8986595	But you get Memorial Day, right?
8987075	8987276	Yes.
8987456	8990216	Oh, but we have other plans for Memorial Day weekend, most likely.
8991437	8991577	So...
8993098	8993778	Sometime.
8993858	8995119	It is in our minds.
8995159	8995779	Let me put it that way.
8995819	8999521	It's just, you know, again, that whole thing I talked about earlier about only being able to stay up so late.
8999881	9003062	But I think it would be fun to do another like noon to midnight show if nothing else.
9003843	9004843	So we'll see.
9005523	9009385	It's on our minds, but just not in the next month or two.
9010680	9013041	Alright, let's see, moving on to some other tweets.
9014001	9015761	TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets.
9015861	9018402	I'll start with this one about the Writers Guild.
9019522	9022543	Announces a list of nominees for Best Writing in Video Games.
9023003	9029024	You know, the WGA, they also nominate movies and things like that, but now they get into writing for video games.
9029084	9032245	After all, a lot of video games are very movie-sized scripts these days, right?
9032785	9038246	So, these games got nominated for Best Video Game Writing by the WGA.
9039088	9040596	Assassin's Creed Revelations
9041704	9046365	Batman Arkham City, Brink, Mortal Kombat.
9047085	9049285	It's strange, but I guess it did have a story mode.
9049926	9051806	And Uncharted 3, Drake's Deception.
9052666	9054486	Those are the nominees from the WGA.
9055907	9057867	List needs more Portal 2, in my opinion.
9058107	9060908	That's kind of an obviously missing game.
9061568	9067029	But yeah, I mean, still a lot of those games are very good and have very, you know, stories that suck you in.
9067129	9068369	So there you go.
9068909	9074098	Again, our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9074479	9077324	If you'd like to go ahead and give us a call, you can at any time.
9077945	9078185	All right.
9079367	9080589	One other story from Tiger Claw.
9081829	9086252	Whistleblower alleges unlawful practices at Codemasters.
9087733	9089654	He links us to this story on Shaq News.
9090235	9094978	A former Codemasters employee has publicly accused the publisher of unlawful business practices.
9095918	9111509	A programmer, Semisesi, I hope I said that right, was a programmer on the game Body Count, says that Codemasters has threatened former staff with bankruptcy proceedings over a dispute regarding wages the company claims were mistakenly paid out.
9112509	9116970	He wrote this whole blog post about it saying that Codemasters frequently infringed on employees' rights.
9117970	9123251	They failed to give workers 11 hours of rest in any 24-hour work period.
9124091	9126792	So in other words, yet another slave driving game company story.
9126892	9130792	Unfortunately, we hear way too many of these on the show, which is really sad.
9131172	9133633	But anyway, we got a call coming in on the Skype line, so let's go to it.
9133713	9135133	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
9135173	9135533	Who's this?
9136233	9137153	This is VidPower.
9137333	9138234	Hey, VidPower.
9138434	9139894	I haven't heard from you in a very long time.
9139914	9140394	How are you doing?
9141055	9141595	Good, good.
9141996	9143096	What's up with you guys?
9143717	9145958	You know, same old shit, different week, 10 years later.
9146658	9147199	Right, right.
9147379	9147859	Exactly.
9148179	9151221	So yeah, I wanted to call in and talk about CES.
9151741	9152302	CES.
9152382	9152842	Oh, that's right.
9152862	9153763	You're in Vegas, right?
9153843	9154263	You still there?
9154303	9154703	Indeed.
9155183	9155564	Exactly.
9155584	9157445	So in your backyard, did you go to the party?
9159633	9160273	Yes, I did.
9160353	9168177	I did go to CES and I checked out the video games there and I kind of wanted to tell you guys what stuff was good there.
9168197	9168578	Please do.
9168658	9169738	Our man on the street.
9169878	9170219	Please.
9170619	9171279	How was CES?
9171319	9172100	What did you see?
9172800	9173380	It was pretty good.
9173420	9173941	It's pretty good.
9174001	9174341	You know what?
9175121	9175902	The one game that...
9177623	9184107	Really kind of came out to me and I wasn't expecting to like was, believe it or not, it was Microsoft Flight.
9185547	9186568	Oh, okay.
9187088	9188789	The upcoming flight simulator.
9188809	9191410	Yeah, that's like their replacement for Microsoft Flight Simulator, right?
9191490	9194072	It's kind of their new version of that for a new generation.
9194798	9195699	Exactly, exactly.
9195759	9201123	You know, I've only played like a flight simulator like once or twice in my life and I was like really awful.
9201303	9207267	So, you know, this game wasn't really on my radar, but after playing it and...
9208604	9210766	It was really fun, I gotta admit.
9210866	9212127	Was it easy to pick up?
9212187	9216391	Because I know the problem with a lot of flight simulators is that I don't know how to fly a fucking plane.
9217212	9224639	It is a flight simulator, and if you don't know the proper sequence to turn the plane on to get it to take off, you're not going anywhere in that game.
9225020	9227402	Or does Microsoft Flight kind of simplify that?
9227970	9228610	Yeah, yeah.
9228871	9235794	So what they did was they had a setup on a PC, but they had an Xbox 360 controller connected to the PC.
9236495	9239376	And one of the developers was there.
9240157	9244199	And basically, he had these bunch of challenges.
9244839	9250782	And it really, using just the Xbox 360 controller, it was really simplified controls.
9250922	9253224	And it makes flying a plane way easier.
9253704	9253904	Hmm.
9255069	9257210	Much easier than I thought it would be.
9257891	9258391	Interesting.
9259692	9261553	But yeah, it was really fun.
9261593	9266796	They had really basic stuff like how to take off and how to land.
9266816	9273599	And they had some fun stuff like how to collect all these little fly-through rings and stuff.
9273959	9274620	Things like that.
9275160	9277342	Wasn't that one of the stages in Pilotwings?
9277562	9278743	No, no.
9278783	9280384	But very good-looking graphics, I assume.
9280404	9285247	I remember flight simulators were always really good demonstrators of graphical capabilities.
9285267	9286728	That was also one of the stages in Superman 64.
9286768	9287088	Oh, shut up.
9291571	9291871	Awesome.
9292672	9295674	How big of a presence does video gaming have at CES?
9295694	9298696	Because we're usually told that it's not there as much as you'd think.
9299477	9301018	Well, yeah, that's an accurate statement.
9301078	9302939	It's definitely not big.
9303480	9308644	In terms of video game related stuff, obviously at the Microsoft booth.
9309862	9311664	and at the Sony booth as well.
9312224	9313165	Those are pretty obvious.
9313265	9319390	But other than that, like you couldn't really find anything else that were video game related.
9320431	9325254	So those are like really the only two booths that you could go to to play actual video games.
9325535	9325935	Gotcha.
9326275	9331019	Was there anything just, you know, since we're all nerds here at OLR, was there anything that kind of jumped out at you?
9331059	9333201	Like, wow, this is something I really want in my living room.
9333241	9338745	Like even if it's not necessarily gaming related, was there any device that just made you go like, dang, I want one of these next Christmas?
9341350	9343751	Tell you the truth, not really.
9343912	9352137	It was just a lot of random cool stuff that was probably not ready for a consumer level until a few years down the line.
9352477	9353457	It's all too damn expensive.
9353818	9357240	How does one of those 100-foot HDTVs look in person?
9357947	9359728	It is pretty sweet, gotta admit.
9361269	9364990	Seeing that in person was pretty eye-opening there.
9365771	9366751	Awesome, awesome.
9367051	9371914	Now, does the Porn Expo still go on next door at the same time, or did that change now?
9372614	9378857	You know what, that one, the original Porn Expo, now it's on the week after CES.
9379417	9384640	However, this completely separate company is doing another adult
9385780	9387220	and convention things.
9387401	9388181	They're in the same time.
9388221	9390161	So, you know, tapping into that market.
9390281	9392502	Back-to-back adult cons in Las Vegas.
9392822	9394663	I guess it can sustain.
9394963	9395583	We'll see.
9397103	9397503	Good time.
9397563	9399124	One of these days I got to make it to CES.
9399164	9402885	That's got to be on my bucket list of things to do at some point.
9403445	9404885	Do you have to be industry to get into CES?
9404905	9405826	No, I don't think so.
9406206	9406766	I thought you did.
9407306	9407446	Really?
9407466	9409927	Technically you do, but it's pretty easy.
9410507	9411927	Like the old E3, it's really easy?
9412347	9413468	Yeah, it's pretty easy.
9413508	9414228	Very cool, very cool.
9414488	9416309	Well, VidPower, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
9417510	9422554	No, just kind of giving you guys a quick gaming summary over at CES.
9422975	9424656	I played some of the other house party games.
9424976	9425597	Yeah?
9426517	9428018	I Am Alive is good stuff.
9428319	9429279	I really enjoyed that.
9429359	9430760	It's really fun.
9430981	9432322	It reminds me of Prince of Persia.
9433975	9454561	and uh the the combat quote-unquote combat is uh remember playing uh Metal Gear Solid games and you know you can hold up people by pointing a gun at them the entire combat is kind of centered around like intimidating your opponents by pointing a gun at them so that's like really original and I had a lot of fun with that interesting did you play the new Alan Wake at all
9455209	9456510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9475607	9480235	I guess it was kind of one of those games that sold gradually, from what I understand.
9480275	9483139	It never really was the chart topper, but it lasted for a long time.
9483580	9483660	Yeah.
9485936	9487077	Definitely, definitely.
9487177	9493223	All right, well, VidPower, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls, hopefully, but thank you so much for the call, and maybe see you at CES 2013.
9494404	9495125	Cool, cool.
9495165	9495506	Later.
9495786	9496226	Take care, buddy.
9497167	9498248	All right, Las Vegas.
9498308	9499790	We have quite a few listeners in Las Vegas.
9499810	9501291	That's a town I need to get back to and visit.
9501311	9503193	It probably doesn't even look the same.
9503594	9507077	You know the last time I was in Vegas was 2001, a long time ago.
9507277	9509339	I went a few years ago.
9510841	9512942	There was no tram the last time I was in Vegas.
9513162	9516744	And apparently they have like a whole tram thing that goes to all the big casinos now on the strip.
9518225	9519926	Yeah, I don't think I was there when they had a tram.
9520366	9522467	Last time I was there, we went and visited Zappos.
9523568	9524608	That's an awesome company.
9524809	9526870	And the Sahara... Oh, yeah.
9526970	9527610	I know Zappos.
9527630	9532353	Yeah, that's the... Their call center has a really big reputation.
9532913	9534094	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9534574	9535315	It's fucking amazing.
9535335	9537376	Yeah, I was a call center trainer for many, many years.
9537396	9538536	That's a company I would love to get into.
9538556	9539277	It was just like...
9540218	9541400	I really wish it worked.
9541440	9544745	Yeah, it's a company a lot of folks modeled themselves after.
9544765	9546087	They have a DVR machine in their building, by the way.
9546107	9546507	Do they really?
9546728	9547269	I played on it.
9547749	9548310	Interesting.
9548370	9548671	What mix?
9549244	9552566	It was... I think it was a max two, if I remember correctly.
9552586	9553026	Not bad.
9553286	9553406	Yeah.
9553426	9555047	You can stay fit on lunch breaks.
9555787	9556707	Yep.
9556787	9557168	Very cool.
9557188	9560389	1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9560429	9561289	We're out of tweet topics.
9561369	9563230	They also have napping pods.
9564111	9564571	Really?
9564751	9565351	They do.
9565811	9566692	That's amazing.
9567452	9574415	All their conference rooms are themed and each of their little rows and departments or wherever, they have themed... It's fucking amazing.
9574495	9575096	It's seriously...
9576056	9577117	Star Trek Experience Warp Core Breach
9601267	9621021	that was the year 2000 that was October 2000 because I did two trips to Vegas like almost back to back and then I haven't been back in like 10 years but uh that was the first time I was ever drunk I was like 22 or 23 so you know but I was at the I know I totally missed the 21 years old thing go figure but uh yeah that was at the Star Trek experience and um
9622282	9623983	It wasn't the first time I'd ever had alcohol.
9624363	9625624	It was the first time I got drunk.
9626405	9628346	And like a true nerd, it was at the Star Trek experience.
9629266	9630627	The Borg thing wasn't even there.
9630667	9631508	I never got to ride it.
9631748	9633329	And now it's all closed, which is sad.
9634689	9636911	Oh, did one of the kitties finally come out?
9637251	9637891	Yeah, to eat.
9638131	9638512	To eat.
9639812	9642114	He's like, all right, I'll put up with Loki being here.
9642154	9642854	Maruko's here.
9643555	9643815	All right.
9644655	9645776	Let's try to take another call here.
9645836	9646777	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9646797	9647117	Who's this?
9647937	9648658	Hey, it's Cinderwolf.
9649098	9650039	Hey, what's up, Cinderwolf?
9650059	9650659	What's on your mind, buddy?
9651723	9652384	Not too much.
9652404	9655928	I actually just figured I finally have time to actually catch the broadcast tonight.
9655948	9658511	Thought I'd call in and say hi to everybody.
9659051	9659972	Well, hello, hello.
9660032	9661895	Aren't you from Canada, if I remember right?
9662575	9662936	I am.
9663036	9663797	Yeah, you've got it.
9664197	9669022	Well, you don't have a three-day weekend then because Martin Luther King is a very American holiday.
9669062	9672326	So you just happen to have a late Sunday available, huh?
9673496	9674156	Yeah, pretty much.
9674337	9676940	I usually get about a half a day, really.
9677080	9679323	Three quarters of a day a week between both jobs.
9679623	9680344	Alright, alright.
9680384	9681205	Wow, wow, alright.
9681886	9682466	So crazy, crazy.
9682506	9684869	Well, since you got a chance to call in, what do you want to talk about tonight?
9684929	9687192	Any story or maybe something we missed?
9688623	9689904	Well, actually, I'm going to be very honest.
9690024	9694786	I did actually miss quite a bit of the broadcast, so I'll actually have to go back and catch up on it tomorrow.
9695006	9701389	But I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about a game that I've been playing recently called Bastion, actually.
9701849	9703249	Oh, yes, of course, Bastion.
9703890	9705510	The Canadian launches the game.
9706591	9707371	Yes, of course.
9707391	9709352	Pretty much, yeah.
9709432	9712713	Actually, I just double-checked my Skyrim count.
9712733	9716435	I've been playing Skyrim for about 180 hours over the past month and a half now.
9717319	9741729	and uh actually the video card died so I'm borrowing a replacement from a buddy of mine can't run Skyrim but I can play Bastion of all things so well Bastion is you know not quite the cutting edge 3D graphics but sometimes it is not all about the graphics right no I mean it's not not at all in fact I find this sort of gaming revolution even though it's uh most of everything seems to be
9742977	9745680	3D and impressive graphics.
9745780	9756629	I find there's still this growing movement to go old school or traditional sort of 2D with cell shading or that sort of thing.
9756989	9757990	2D side scrollers even.
9761233	9765036	So what possessed you to decide to jump in and check out Bastion?
9766778	9774067	I actually picked up the demo online through the 360 back before the console update with the dashboard.
9774167	9776069	And it was sort of an update right in my face.
9776109	9777811	I was like, you know, I love the artwork.
9777851	9782457	I'm actually a major fan of artwork working actually at a comic shop as well.
9784381	9785361	and it really stood out to me.
9785401	9788762	I found the artwork is actually very fantastic, very amazing.
9790123	9795284	It's almost like somebody's sketching the world and it just sort of comes to life and that stood out to me at the time.
9795344	9799085	So I'm playing this and I'm like, wow, the controls are very simplistic.
9799165	9801186	It's an incredibly basic story.
9801226	9804707	You don't even need to know anything about the game to start getting into it.
9805907	9812929	And even two hours into the game, you're still like, okay, I still don't know the entire backstory so it's sort of driving you to
9813930	9819592	Really keep playing to find out how it's going to end and exactly what the calamity is.
9820673	9828996	Now, a lot of folks have kind of talked about the narration in the game and how important that the whole narration and narrating it as it's unfolding.
9829256	9833558	Do you think the narration is something really unique to the game or are you kind of like, ah, this is gimmicky?
9835119	9838360	Actually, I actually love the narration.
9839080	9840961	Once in a while it's kind of cheesy, but
9841972	9846877	Actually, it really makes it feel almost kind of like, you know, like story time when you're a kid, so to speak.
9847397	9853224	But it's not enough that it's, or it's not so much that you're like, okay, this is really something that annoys me.
9853744	9856367	It's a, hey, actually, I never really thought of it that way.
9858109	9859911	Sort of deal when it hits when it hits a new point.
9860786	9872419	And you're just like, well, you know, I kind of like the backstory dialogue when you're, you know, you smoke the little pipe, you go to this little area to essentially just grind and grind and grind, pick up your little crystal shards or fragments.
9873160	9877385	And in between each wave, there's a little piece of the kid's backstory in the background.
9877425	9880829	So it's like, hey, that's kind of neat, bringing me up to speed on who I'm actually playing with.
9881243	9904024	and I thought it was kind of interesting that like as you kind of put that center area together it can kind of change the way the narration is going to because each building that you build kind of changes you know you get a little different narration for that so yeah actually I found the narration did change a little bit between buildings but by the end of it you know you're like I'm I still have to be only about halfway through it but
9905038	9910059	I find the narration really ends up the same because you end up building the same buildings by the end of it anyway.
9910079	9910879	Sure, sure.
9911219	9920221	So in a way, there's a little bit of a sort of a multi-path, but it's still a very linear storyline, which there's nothing wrong with linear.
9920721	9933084	But the way they've gone about the story kind of makes you think, well, you know, maybe if I play it a little bit differently later on, even though I know the ending, is it going to be more of a challenge or am I going to discover things I didn't know were there before?
9934048	9939309	I thought the game was really well developed in dragging and sucking you into it to see it through to the end.
9941170	9947091	Alright, well it sounds like you are definitely enjoying Bastion, so are you hoping there's going to be a sequel?
9947512	9948392	As if I need to ask?
9950132	9950612	Definitely.
9952153	9953233	I can hope.
9953293	9960355	I mean, there have been the rumors of Buzz online saying there is, saying there aren't, and you know, we just all have to sort of cross our fingers, but
9960819	9965510	I figure once I finish this, I'll probably round Skyrim count up to 200 hours or so.
9967296	9967916	Alright, nice.
9968296	9977079	Alright, well, Cinderwolf, thanks so much for the call and reminding us that Bastion might be one of those games you missed at the end of 2011 amongst all the Skyrim, so check it out.
9977299	9979700	Alright, well, Cinderwolf, you have a good one and thanks so much for calling in.
9980320	9980640	You too.
9980860	9981460	Alright, take care, buddy.
9981500	9981880	You guys too.
9982761	9985782	Oop, he cut out there at the end, but we'll just hope he said something nice.
9986062	9991083	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio if you want to give us a call.
9991103	9992463	We've got time for about one more call.
9992824	9993984	We can fit in one more call, right?
9994605	10000172	So yes, Alan, while you were AFK, your kitties are finally starting to integrate with the show a little bit.
10000733	10004919	It's just a matter of time before we get Maruko on air with a comment.
10005059	10006241	Loki, that means they're warming up to you.
10006261	10007622	They're like, this guy ain't gonna leave.
10008123	10009986	They're like, it's been three hours and we're hungry.
10011997	10013298	We're going to just come out to the food dish.
10014840	10020424	Some of the chatters are asking for pictures, so I'll have to take one and put it on the website.
10020444	10024888	I mean, I have old pics, but... I have a Tumblr post that's bookmarked that I can link and chat.
10025068	10025829	Okay, yeah, do that.
10025849	10027991	They wouldn't be pictures from like right this second, though.
10030231	10033052	My iPhone camera is fucked.
10033172	10038753	The back camera, I think I scratched it or something, but there's too much exposure in one corner.
10039493	10041834	It looks blurry and greasy and shitty.
10042054	10044114	My touchscreen is starting to go out.
10044974	10048655	Your main thumb button at the bottom doesn't wake it up either.
10048955	10053356	I really need to get a new phone and technically I'm eligible for a free upgrade right now, but it's like I don't
10054025	10055265	I don't want a 4S, I want a 5.
10056506	10057786	So I can wait it out, right?
10058226	10058386	Yeah.
10058626	10058907	Right?
10059707	10060007	We'll see.
10060027	10063368	Mine, I think, is from my son dropping it on the floor over and over again.
10063388	10064708	Well, you should punish him.
10064728	10065328	All right, I'm just kidding.
10065348	10066949	All right, we got time for about one more call.
10066969	10068189	So let's try to get one more call.
10068209	10069110	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10069150	10069490	Who's this?
10070330	10071290	Hi, this is Yuni.
10071550	10072251	Hey, Yuni.
10073031	10075632	Tonight is like long time no talk night.
10075692	10078112	Like all these people that are calling in, I haven't heard from them forever.
10078152	10078733	This is awesome.
10078973	10079693	Well, how are you, Yuni?
10080487	10084348	I'm good, I have laryngitis, so forgive me if I sound weird.
10084728	10091370	It's alright, I'm just glad, you know, amongst all the comments of tonight being a sausage fest, I'm glad we get a lovely lady calling in.
10091470	10095491	This weekend we hung out with someone who probably has strep, so.
10095611	10096751	Yeah, so it's not strep.
10097531	10101172	It's a matter of time before I am sick too, probably for the next show I'll be coming in here.
10101952	10103233	and ZR5 Radio.
10103253	10106314	So Mr. Spanky will be making a return.
10107614	10108775	Yeah, Mr. Spanky will make a return.
10108995	10109715	Well, Uni, I'm sorry.
10109755	10110616	I don't mean to derail.
10110936	10112116	To what do we owe this phone call tonight?
10112136	10112597	What's on your mind?
10113357	10117959	I just missed you guys and I haven't heard you guys in forever.
10118749	10122550	When you were wishing Joe a happy birthday, which is Dark Tetsuya, sorry.
10122950	10124111	Happy birthday, Joe.
10124171	10125911	I know it is a little late, but I know.
10126091	10133293	I did go over to his Facebook and I did the appropriate because, you know, he loves it when John does this to me, the Rob, Rob, Rob thing.
10133313	10135894	So I went to his wall and said, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
10136154	10136414	What?
10137134	10138775	Happy birthday.
10140589	10142332	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10158292	10158852	7 actually.
10158952	10160014	We have been on the air.
10160074	10161115	This is our 10th year.
10161676	10162797	June will be 10 years.
10162877	10163718	It's crazy.
10164158	10166261	I think I started listening in year 3.
10168383	10171627	So at least... So did I. Even though a lot...
10173709	10173809	So, so
10202128	10204410	Uni, what video games do you play these days?
10205070	10207412	I play World of Warcraft and Argent Dawn.
10207912	10209653	I have eight 85s.
10209974	10212315	Oh my god, that's great.
10212355	10212736	You know what?
10213116	10219521	I have noticed with this expansion, it's really easy for people to be in that multiple 85 camp now.
10220101	10222223	I never thought I would have more than one, and I have four.
10222243	10224084	I have four 85s on three different servers.
10226998	10235013	I also play StarCraft 2 I'm bronze rank but I play Protoss I need advice how do I get good at StarCraft 2?
10236922	10238262	Focus on your economy.
10238643	10243284	You focus on putting... Okay, I'm just going to say this.
10243764	10247865	Drones, probes, SUVs, whichever you play.
10247885	10249465	If you play Terran, it's SUVs.
10249845	10253526	Okay, what you do is you constantly pump those out.
10253766	10257227	Like around five minutes, you make your next expansion.
10257947	10259547	It's like a whole entire build order.
10259607	10261588	It's all about build order.
10262088	10263190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10278750	10280871	It smushes their faces in.
10281091	10282791	It's like hilarious.
10282831	10283891	That's what it's all about.
10283911	10286192	This is my favorite thing.
10286252	10291353	You're going to think I'm such a dumbass, but this is my favorite thing in StarCraft II is Star Jeweled.
10291533	10292793	Have you ever played Star Jeweled?
10293213	10293554	No.
10293814	10294854	Oh, you've got to check it out.
10294934	10296714	It's Bejeweled, and it's free.
10296794	10298375	It's like one of the custom maps.
10298475	10299175	Just go look for it.
10299195	10300055	It's a Blizzard map.
10300395	10303656	It's called Star Jeweled, and it mixes Bejeweled and StarCraft.
10306296	10307638	After the show, you've got to go check it out.
10308499	10310521	Let me ask you this real quick before we say goodbye.
10311463	10315248	Heart of the Swarm coming out soon, hopefully soon-ish.
10315648	10317371	What are you most looking forward to in Heart of the Swarm?
10318705	10321786	I'm mostly looking forward to Diablo 3.
10321906	10327127	The hardest one is going to be awesome, but I'm more looking forward to Diablo 3.
10327607	10328387	You know what?
10328728	10329628	That's a fair answer.
10329808	10331048	Because I'm in the same boat.
10331528	10333969	StarCraft 2, it's alright, but Diablo 3, bring it on.
10334009	10336129	Have you been able to play the beta at all?
10338190	10339490	No, I'm not in the beta.
10339610	10340310	I wish I was.
10341131	10346592	I don't mean to rub it in, but I did get in the beta a few months ago, so I have played through it, and it's very nice.
10347248	10348069	It's okay.
10348269	10349029	I don't hate you.
10349129	10349910	I love you, Rob.
10351651	10353392	I'm going to let you go if you want.
10353572	10353852	All right.
10353892	10354292	Yeah, sure.
10354572	10355413	We better wrap up the show.
10355453	10358034	It's after 9 o'clock or midnight for you East Coast folks.
10358515	10358795	All right.
10359315	10359835	We'll let you go.
10359995	10361436	But thanks so much for calling in and saying hello.
10362917	10363177	Okay.
10363277	10363778	Bye.
10363858	10364318	Take care.
10364438	10364798	Have fun.
10365118	10366119	Remember, Star Jeweled.
10366419	10366659	All right.
10366699	10366999	Bye.
10367079	10367480	Okay.
10367660	10367800	Bye.
10368880	10370982	Also, IyerChef is a lot of fun, too.
10371042	10373583	And there's a Left 4 Dead one, too.
10373623	10376706	It's like Left... I can't remember the name.
10376746	10378047	It's Left 4 something else.
10378127	10378827	Just look for that.
10381089	10383030	Somebody in chat will scream it out in a minute here.
10383511	10384631	Alright, we gotta wrap up.
10386048	10386989	Thank you so much for the calls.
10387109	10392934	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, although I gotta say that was an awesome night of Skype calls because we got to talk to like three people we haven't talked to in a long time.
10394655	10400020	Email bag is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com You could leave us a voicemail on the Skype line.
10400080	10403763	Sometimes we do play those if they're concise and to the point.
10405244	10411650	But yeah, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We only had two emails tonight, so those of you that didn't get through, get your... Excuse me.
10413775	10415356	Oh, radio's worst nightmare, the hiccups.
10415997	10419000	Get your thoughts in via email and we'll get those on the next show.
10419440	10424564	Alright, before we really put the bow on the show tonight and say we're done, I need to go over to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.
10424705	10425005	Or Alan.
10425569	10431954	Yes, THQ has come out and they've released a statement saying, no, they have not cancelled their 2014 lineup.
10432494	10445024	They are saying, additionally, we are thrilled with the great performance of Saints Row the Third, which on a like for the period in North America has tripled in sell-through from Saints Row 2.
10445304	10449247	In addition, WWE 12's worldwide sales are up 40% year over year.
10451008	10457374	as well as, according to the NPD, in the month of December, THQ was number five publisher overall, number four third party.
10457895	10461418	Also, they reported growth of 18% in the market.
10461478	10462299	That was down almost 6%.
10462399	10464421	All right, well, there you go.
10464561	10466723	Loki with breaking news here on OLR.
10466764	10467064	OLR.
10478086	10478947	THQ's not dead.
10479347	10479727	There it is.
10480888	10481429	I didn't think so.
10481509	10483671	I mean, they're one of the major publishers out there.
10483991	10489336	If there's any publisher that's gonna die, it would be... Okay, let me think.
10489456	10490657	Semi... Atari.
10490717	10492639	Atari's the next fucking publisher to go.
10492679	10494820	I mean, they're like clinging onto the grave.
10494840	10496282	You know what we need here at OLR?
10496342	10499324	We need the... I mean, this is kind of a sad game to play, though, but I don't know.
10499624	10504349	Like, it's always sad when studios close, but we do kind of need the publisher death pool.
10505450	10507191	You know how they have the celebrity death pool?
10507571	10509131	Like which celebrity is going to kick the bucket next?
10509151	10510892	Rotten.com has that, if you remember that site.
10511812	10513473	They're still around, aren't they?
10513593	10516134	Here's all that Atari has coming right now.
10516734	10523037	They have Test Drive Ferrari Legends, which is Test Drive Unlimited.
10524417	10529579	And also The Witcher 2, which is going to be coming to the consoles next.
10529699	10534462	I mean, The Witcher 2 did well on PC, but, dude, that's all they have.
10534682	10539324	And maybe, no, no, no, they're not doing any more Dragon Ball games.
10539845	10540305	That's it.
10540385	10541185	That's all they have.
10541305	10542986	So there's not a lot coming out.
10544507	10544867	All right.
10545728	10547128	Maybe we need to have that here.
10547208	10552711	That can be a segment on another Slow News Week, the publisher death pool.
10554232	10557254	And we'll see, take bets on which publisher's going to fold before the end of the year.
10557274	10559155	All right, any other breaking news, or was that it?
10562053	10568381	Well, this is not news, but the RetroDuo portable, the NES SNES portable system looks pretty sweet.
10570183	10570643	Oh, yeah.
10571024	10573467	The technology patent on that's expired.
10573527	10579073	So you're going to start seeing, just like you see all the Nintendo rip-offs now, you're going to start seeing Super Nintendo ones all over the place pretty soon.
10579994	10581476	So, alrighty.
10583806	10586389	Alan, I'm assuming you don't have any last minute stories tonight?
10586489	10586609	Nope.
10586890	10587550	Alright, I figured it.
10587570	10589953	But you do have pictures of cute kitties that I saw in the chat room.
10590053	10590214	Yes.
10590374	10590634	Thank you.
10591215	10598724	Alright, maybe, I don't know if Ranma can do this, but maybe he can reblog that over to the OLR Tumblr so everybody can see the kitties.
10598824	10598985	Yeah.
10599165	10599565	That'd be great.
10600126	10600366	All right.
10601707	10603929	That's going to do it then for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10603989	10606952	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us tonight.
10607252	10608153	You know what we say, guys.
10608333	10611435	If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, all we do, we ask, tell a friend.
10611836	10612196	You know what?
10612236	10618081	Just say, hey, there's this show out there and they don't have a big magazine backing them or a website that gets hundreds of millions of hits.
10618881	10621523	But you should check them out because it's a fun time and come join us and chat sometime.
10621543	10622464	So help us spread the word.
10623185	10624106	You can do that by telling friends.
10624406	10625847	Leave a nice review on iTunes.
10625887	10626828	We always appreciate that too.
10627428	10632192	or, you know, just a little shout out in your signature on a forum or whatever.
10632793	10635014	We really appreciate all the word of mouth that we can get.
10635074	10636135	So thank you guys again.
10636395	10637136	We really appreciate it.
10637697	10639398	I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10639878	10642580	Alan, thank you so much for filling in at the last minute yet again.
10642861	10643962	You've done that twice this month.
10644062	10644502	You're welcome.
10644622	10645062	I owe you.
10646604	10648745	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
10649066	10650467	Thanks for letting me use your laptop.
10651408	10651888	You're welcome.
10652248	10655471	And I'm making orange chicken.
10656373	10680794	mmm can't wait and steamed rice delicious we're gonna eat that after the show wraps nom nom nom let's see my final thought is I just realized we have two posters in here that say haters to the left and one points one way and one points the other so I'm confused which way did the haters go because they're on opposite walls either out the front door or into the kitchen to cook for us okay fair enough I'm gonna say into the oven oh my god
10683107	10684768	Like the witch, like a Tansel and Gretel.
10685128	10687289	Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10688249	10692231	My final thought is I really don't want to eat McDonald's anymore.
10692872	10693852	I'm going to try to stop.
10694452	10696453	Is that a late New Year's resolution?
10696513	10697374	Is that what I'm hearing over there?
10697414	10700175	No, it's been one I've been toiling around, and I was actually going to do that.
10700415	10706258	I was just running a little bit late this evening, so there wasn't really any time for me to stop anywhere else.
10706538	10709359	I could have heated up some soup, but I didn't have a lot of time to do that.
10710179	10710700	I made this
10711880	10713241	Cheddar and beer soup.
10713781	10719504	I don't care for it too much, though, because the beer didn't cook out.
10720305	10725768	And so it's got a lot of, you know, if you drink the whole pot of it, I guess you can get a little bit buzzed.
10725848	10729970	But it wasn't quite how I had pictured it.
10729990	10731150	I put too many leaks in it, too.
10731190	10731871	It's too sweet.
10732891	10733332	Sorry.
10733832	10736193	I'm laughing at what Actdeft said in chat.
10736513	10739635	And I'm assuming this is about the haters to the left sign that points to the kitchen.
10740375	10741236	Haters gonna bake.
10743491	10745772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10768724	10771426	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
