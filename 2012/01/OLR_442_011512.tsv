0	19640	Tonight, January 15th, 2012, Kid Icarus Uprising will come with a bundled accessory.
19640	29760	A new PC gaming tablet is shown at CES, and can Apple IOS gaming actually save your life?
29760	35040	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35040	38880	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38880	46920	We are live with the 442nd episode of our show for this January the 15th of 2012.
46920	50820	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you tonight with my co-host, actually, I won't
50820	54520	be joining you with Dark Sakura tonight, sadly, Dark Sakura is off.
54520	59320	She unexpectedly had something come up where she is in San Francisco tonight, doing some
59320	62280	friend stuff, so she's not here.
62280	67680	So sadly, she will not be joining us tonight, but we always like an excuse to say hello
67680	70320	to Salacious Pop, who's filling in tonight.
70320	71720	As always, as usual.
71720	77640	Who's kind of become the Joan Rivers of our show, the always fill-in host when Johnny
77640	78640	Carson was gone.
78640	81880	That reference is way too old for any of our listeners.
81880	85680	If I tried to hide in the office while you were recording, I'd just get knock knock knock.
85680	89760	The show only has two people tonight, you have to help.
89760	91960	Do you really want this show to be a complete failure?
91960	92960	Actually, no.
92960	96400	Loki and I have done a show alone before, but it's more fun with three.
96400	97400	It was fantastic.
97400	98400	Three's a crowd.
98400	101400	Oh yes, there he is, Techmaster Loki is here tonight.
101400	102400	I'm here.
102400	103400	How are you doing, Loki?
103400	108680	Thankfully, Alan came to the rescue with barbecue sauce, because McDonald's, you know, if the
108680	111880	sauces have green covers, they must be the same, right?
111880	118000	Because habanero is just exactly the same as sweet and sour sauce.
118000	122080	And of course, always joining us, our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, because
122080	128320	you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, home
128320	133200	of such shows as Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us every week, Video Game Outsiders,
133200	136000	Dead Pixel Live, whole bunch of shows, there's a whole roster of shows.
136000	138220	I'd name them all, but I would fill up the three hours.
138220	141720	So check that out at allgames.com.
141720	142720	Let's see.
142720	146840	And going to our live chat room, who's always with us, Tigerclaw starts us off saying, oh,
146840	150120	tonight's show is a sausage fest, I guess, if you want to look at it that way.
150120	154320	But we will have chatter comments, and I know there's some lovely ladies that chat with
154320	157760	the show, and then of course, Twitter, and hopefully phone calls later.
157760	161160	So you know, it'll be ladies' night on the Skype line, hopefully, we'll get some women
161160	162160	to call in.
162160	164120	But you know what?
164120	167880	No matter what your gender is, we're all gamers, that's what it's about here, video games,
167880	172720	the gamer lifestyle, and the show where every gamer has a voice.
172720	175880	Tonight before we get into our gaming weeks, you know, we usually do a little bit of topics
175880	178240	at the start of the show.
178240	179880	We're up against the Golden Globes tonight.
179880	183880	It seems like having a show on a Sunday, we're always up against some stupid award show.
183880	184880	Oh, that's tonight?
184880	185880	I totally didn't even realize.
185880	186880	I didn't know either.
186880	188080	Yes, the Golden Globes is tonight.
188080	191120	I mean, honestly, guys, I mean, are you really gonna watch the show?
191120	193200	Just read it tomorrow like everybody else.
193200	198920	I will say this is that the whole Ricky Jervis thing where he's like a total like asshole,
198920	203800	but like, it's funny, like, you know, he just says what everybody's thinking like that part
203800	204800	will be cool.
204800	209080	But I know that all the good zingers will be hosting I'm assuming Oh, yeah, like remember
209080	210080	that whole thing?
210080	212440	Like he's not going to come back to host he's not gonna he was disrespectful and he did
212440	214400	not represent our point of view.
214400	218400	And it's like, oh, shit, people love it when he trolled so highest fucking ratings in like
218400	219400	10 years.
219400	222760	Dude, seriously, if you want your show to have great ratings, just fucking get Neil
222760	224160	Patrick Harris to host it.
224160	225640	Okay, he can host anything.
225640	226640	That's the Tonys.
226640	227960	But yeah, I don't care.
227960	228960	He can host anything.
228960	229960	And he's awesome.
229960	230960	Neil Patrick Harris is awesome.
230960	235440	But anyway, thinking about movies had me thinking about the fact that I will tie this into gaming,
235440	236440	I promise.
236440	240920	Um, over the weekend, Alan and I have a new year's resolution this year, actually, this
240920	245440	was actual or I should say, Alan has a new year's resolution that I've been, and we use
245440	248780	his term at work, volun told.
248780	249780	That's where you weren't.
249780	252360	That's where you didn't volunteer for you that volun told so I got volun told for this
252360	253360	new year's resolution.
253360	254360	But I liked it.
254360	255360	So I went along with it.
255360	256360	So what is the new year's resolution?
256360	259480	It's something I've done in 07 or 08 that worked really well.
259480	264400	And it's to just see one movie in theaters a month, regardless of what's out.
264400	265960	One movie a month in theaters.
265960	266960	Yep.
266960	267960	So and that's good.
267960	270160	Because last year we saw like two movies the entire year.
270160	273640	We saw Tangled and Black Swan and those were both done by February and we didn't see a
273640	274640	whole other movie.
274640	278280	I got my movie for February already, but I haven't gotten a chance.
278280	280600	I definitely need to go see it or sneak out to see it.
280600	282640	Wait are you doing the one movie a month thing too?
282640	284840	No, but there's a movie in February I want to see.
284840	285960	What is that?
285960	286960	I don't remember what it's called.
286960	292600	It's the one that was, no no, I can't remember what it's called.
292600	296920	It's the one, it's basically the found footage thing, but it's like these three guys become
296920	300460	kind of, they like get superpowers or telekinetic abilities and stuff like that.
300460	301460	One of them becomes evil.
301460	305720	It's like almost like the plot for Akira but in the United States.
305720	306720	But it looks really cool.
306720	308280	I swear I have never heard of that ever.
308280	309280	I'll find you a trailer.
309280	310280	It's really cool looking.
310280	311280	Interesting.
311280	316160	No, I think our February movie we already decided is going to be the borrower's Miyazaki
316160	317160	version.
317160	318160	Yeah.
318160	319160	The Studio Ghibli.
319160	320160	Yes.
320160	323040	Or I guess it's technically not a Miyazaki film, Studio Ghibli.
323040	325400	So it's the secret of Arietty or something.
325400	326400	Yeah.
326400	328200	So, but anyway, anyway, we keep getting off track.
328200	332840	The movie we did see for this month for January, you know, this is a very manly weekend for
332840	333840	movies.
333840	334840	There's so much out there.
334840	335840	Joyful Noise.
335840	340200	I'm sure everybody ran right after the big 49ers game yesterday to go see Joyful Noise.
340200	345320	But we went to go see Beauty and the Beast 3D, you know, another very manly pick with
345320	346640	all the football games this weekend.
346640	347640	Yeah.
347640	348640	But you know, come on, it's Disney.
348640	351720	And you know how I feel about Disney and Beauty and the Beast really is one of the better,
351720	355160	you know, Disney movies they did kind of part of that whole 90s Renaissance.
355160	360280	So they did the whole 3D thing and we took our friend Victoria, who I think was on the
360280	364760	show a long time ago, none of you guys probably remember her, but we all went and for three
364760	370760	of us, it costs $51 to see Beauty and the Beast 3D, which is, you know, whatever.
370760	371760	It's an event.
371760	372760	Was the 3D worth it?
372760	373760	No.
373760	374760	That's the point I wanted to get to.
374760	375760	Absolutely.
375760	376760	Positively not.
376760	379960	And I have decided that is the last time I'm going to see one of these post-conversion
379960	382120	3D movies.
382120	387240	Even then I'm kind of over 3D, like 3D was really cool and Tron and actually Tangled
387240	388240	was pretty good.
388240	391340	I got to say, you know, but like Beauty and the Beast, I'm sorry, there were maybe two
391340	395440	scenes in the entire movie that were slightly enhanced with 3D.
395440	397440	And one of them, of course, is the ballroom scene.
397440	398640	You guys all know the ballroom scene.
398640	401280	Well, that's the only one that they actually rendered with a computer.
401280	402880	They could do 3D on that.
402880	403880	Exactly.
403880	404880	Exactly.
404880	405880	So they re-rendered it or whatever.
405880	409680	Um, and then there was the, um, uh, Be Our Guest.
409680	413880	They did some neat, there was like one shot in Be Our Guest where I was like, Ooh, 3D.
413880	414880	And that was it.
414880	417520	Oh, and there was a Tangled short beforehand that was really good.
417520	418520	So, you know, whatever.
418520	419520	Yeah.
419520	424560	But, oh my gosh, there's like this rush of 3D movies coming out this year that are all
424560	425800	just fucking 2D conversions.
425800	426800	Okay.
426800	427800	I remember the name of the movie now.
427800	428800	Chronicle.
428800	430800	I haven't heard of it.
430800	434400	I guess I'm just, this is why we need to see more movies.
434400	439080	We can do an awesome, uh, bit of radio here and I could show you the trailer.
439080	440680	This is what happens when Dark Sakura is not here.
440680	443360	When it becomes a sausage fest, we can't stay on the topic of games.
443360	444360	Now it's the movie show.
444360	445360	Okay.
445360	448920	Well, I was happy the fact, cause I mean, I don't know if you read, they were talking
448920	453280	about doing a, you know, live action Akira, you know, it was going to be terrible cause
453280	457200	it was going to be in the United States and just made no sense whatsoever.
457200	460160	But, um, this actually looks pretty cool.
460160	461760	And uh, let's see here.
461760	467280	Before I get to that, uh, let's see, Chizuro in our chat room says $51.
467280	468280	Fuck that shit.
468280	473500	I would require to see some of Bell's Disney titties.
473500	474500	There were no titties.
474500	475700	It's a Disney movie.
475700	476700	Come on.
476700	477700	All right.
477700	478700	All right.
478700	479700	Let's see.
479700	480700	Oh, am I really going to watch this live on air?
480700	481700	Am I really derailing this show?
481700	487320	Cause you know, I was trying to turn this all into a 3d games chat, but hold on here.
487320	488640	Let's go back in and look.
488640	489640	All right.
489640	491820	I'm looking at this trailer.
491820	492820	This is a two minute trail.
492820	493820	I can't watch all this.
493820	494820	It's going to derail the show too much.
494820	495820	I'll watch a little bit.
495820	496820	We'll just watch part of it.
496820	497820	All right.
497820	505400	I'm going to get this on camera.
505400	507760	So what is this all like shot like Blair Witch project style?
507760	513320	Uh, not exactly because they give me a countdown.
513320	517600	The guy that doing this is, you know, using some common sense, figuring out, you know,
517600	520200	this day and age people know how to operate a camera.
520200	522520	Oh, I see.
522520	525560	So it's more like a, uh, like people with their own iPhones.
525560	526560	Whoa.
526560	534520	That was like a full road dog moment there right there.
534520	540320	So they're making a teddy bear dance with telekinetic powers and they're moving a car
540320	541320	with their mind.
541320	544240	Maybe fast forward it a little bit.
544240	548920	So it's a movie about bros that get magneto powers basically, right?
548920	551360	It's not a game.
551360	554240	Stop this right now.
554240	556560	This looks whatever.
556560	558560	All right.
558560	559560	Sure.
559560	560560	It's cool.
560560	561560	Whatever.
561560	562560	Whatever.
562560	563560	I'll get it on Netflix if nothing else.
563560	565200	Um, what I want to, okay.
565200	571200	So yes, my point was before I got so rudely derailed, um, they're converting all of this
571200	574800	2d stuff into 3d because there were how many previews before we saw beauty and the beast?
574800	575800	Like 11 billion.
575800	576800	Right?
576800	577800	Yeah.
577800	582920	And it's finding Nemo back in theaters, star Wars, episode one back in theaters, finding
582920	588040	me Titanic back in theaters, Titanic is stupid, but, uh, finding Nemo makes sense because
588040	592840	it's all CG just re render for two points of view and the 3d will probably be pretty
592840	593840	good on that.
593840	594840	Yeah.
594840	598120	But finding Nemo, I'll give a little bit of a pass, but I'm not paying 51 bucks to see
598120	599120	it again.
599120	600120	I'm sorry.
600120	601120	It'll be on blu-ray.
601120	602120	I could buy the blu-ray for half of that.
602120	603120	You know what I mean?
603120	604120	Yeah.
604120	608680	So I'm kinda, but yeah, it basically anything CG animated is going to be perfect for 3d
608680	610220	because you can render it.
610220	615080	You can re render that so that it's 3d cause you just have to add some more camera angles.
615080	619120	Uh, tiger claw in our chat room at chat.onorshaunter.com says it's Cloverfield, but with super powered
619120	622360	teens at the Cloverfield might be a good, good analogy.
622360	625080	I don't know, but here, here was my point is that, you know, they're converting all
625080	631160	this 2d stuff into 3d and I got, I have to say the star Wars one, I mean, let alone that
631160	635160	it's episode one, which was not a high point for the series.
635160	636840	It didn't look that good to me.
636840	637840	Like, yeah.
637840	638840	Do you agree?
638840	639840	Alan?
639840	640840	I do.
640840	643480	It was just kind of like, like it looked like it was kind of post production stuff.
643480	647680	I mean, and I can't imagine how terrible the ones from the seventies are going to look
647680	649920	with the whole post 3d.
649920	656960	So I mean, I guess cool that is back in theaters for those that want to see it in 2d, but anyway,
656960	660480	my point was now we're getting into more 3d games, right?
660480	662760	And like 3d is kind of where gaming is going.
662760	667360	And my thought is inevitably, inevitably there's going to be a point where we're going to start
667360	670400	seeing games re-released in 3d.
670400	674900	Wait for it because right, we had the halo collector or what halo anniversary edition
674900	675900	this year, right?
675900	679120	Which was the high definition remake of classic games.
679120	680520	That's that's where the industry is right now.
680520	681520	Right?
681520	682520	We get all these high definition remakes.
682520	683520	There's a little bit.
683520	687520	There's a little bit of clarification though, there there's some HD remakes that are kind
687520	691160	of cool where they take the game, remake it in a whole new engine.
691160	692160	That's fine.
692160	694880	The new art department, the final fantasy 10, which despite how you may or may not feel
694880	698920	about final fantasy 10 in the series, the fact that they've come out and said they are
698920	699920	remaking it.
699920	700920	It is not an upgrade.
700920	701920	Okay.
701920	708640	Now like stuff, for example, the Melger solid collection or the, um, like even the God of
708640	713680	war stuff is not really a new, I mean, it's mainly the Melger solid, so, cause that, that
713680	718000	looked really blurry and kind of weird, but there's that silent Hill one coming out in
718000	719000	March.
719000	722360	That's really weird because it's kind of just uprezzing, but they had to do all new voice
722360	726520	acting because of the legal troubles that the, uh, one of the guys in the prior voice
726520	727520	cast.
727520	728520	Silent Hill's dead.
728520	733920	I mean, seriously, that, that series, I can guarantee the new game's going to be terrible.
733920	737760	I mean, it just, it's not, not what it used to be.
737760	742400	They try and they try and they try to figure out what people want and it's just, they get
742400	743400	it wrong.
743400	746800	Every time a game grew in our chat room says Rick rad race.
746800	749440	I almost said Ridge racer Ridge racer.
749440	753440	I'm sure that'll be in 3d at some point too, but he's saying rad racer 3d here.
753440	757400	Remember when the NES games were in 3d remember rad racer, you push select and it would do
757400	761560	the red, blue 3d and there was one other, there was 3d world runner, I think was the
761560	762560	other game.
762560	768160	It was like actual 3d, but it was, it was really, really bad 3d.
768160	769600	You know, it was eighties 3d.
769600	771760	Well, they could easily do that now.
771760	772760	First time we were in this phase.
772760	776000	Well, doesn't Arkham city kind of do like a 3d like that?
776000	778360	Not red, blue, but they do like the other type of glass.
778360	781160	They have that available and they also have actual 3d.
781160	782160	Yeah.
782160	788800	But yeah, it's the, but although that technique is supposed to be to the point where the colors
788800	790820	don't get all messed up from it.
790820	794400	I don't know if that's true or not, but it apparently the glasses, I haven't actually
794400	801080	used them are supposed to preserve the colors so that even though it is the green and kind
801080	804320	of magenta, it's still okay.
804320	808520	So how long do you guys think before 3d remakes become a big craze?
808520	811760	And let's not forget, we did, this is already happening.
811760	815280	If you doubt what we're saying, remember what was the big thing on the 3ds last year?
815280	820160	Zelda 3d was like the only thing on that console worth having for awhile.
820160	822360	And of course there was the star Fox remake as well.
822360	826840	So they're already starting, but it's not even really, they're not even really necessarily
826840	828160	putting that game in the 3d.
828160	831360	It's just, it's once again, it's a new camera.
831360	836520	I don't think that you're going to, you may see some more games ported to, um, to that
836520	837520	system.
837520	842160	And I wouldn't be surprised if super Mario, you know, um, 64 ends up being one of those
842160	843800	cause that makes sense.
843800	846960	But um, I just, that's the shit they should leave for virtual console.
846960	850960	I just don't think they're going to, I don't think that's really going to be that popular
850960	854360	because people don't really care about 3d on consoles right now.
854360	858520	They have it there so they can kind of say, Hey, look, we support 3d and stuff, but it's
858520	862560	not mainstream yet to where everybody has 3d TVs and everything.
862560	868360	Cause even the 3d TVs, I mean the content out there is not very good so far.
868360	870840	So I don't think it's going to be a major trend.
870840	874340	You will see a ton more HD collections though.
874340	878120	Everything's going to be fucking taken and put in the HD if you will.
878120	879120	Yeah.
879120	884640	But especially when we get into the next series of, um, you know, consoles is 3d inevitable.
884640	890200	Like is, is 3d gaming really the future eventually, but I don't think it's going to be something
890200	894360	that they, no, they may re release a bunch of stuff for it.
894360	899560	Why not Alan, you're looking like you're dying to comment.
899560	903080	I think that it should be available with the next generation of consoles, but if they just
903080	907720	say this is it, like telling the consumers what they want rather than just seeing what
907720	909800	the consumers want themselves.
909800	916200	I don't, I don't care about 3d games because you've got the TV and the glasses and all
916200	917200	that horseshit.
917200	918440	It's like, don't stop it.
918440	923760	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com, uh, Kaijuto says, I have a 3d video convert
923760	928520	and I watched the star Wars movies in 3d episode three look good with all the crazy colors.
928520	930960	You mean those blue rays are already in 3d?
930960	934760	I mean, the other thing about beauty and the beast, that shit's been on 3d blue rays since
934760	935760	November.
935760	941880	And when I found that out, I was like, Oh, well that was, you know, that some HDTVs already,
941880	945720	the 3d HDTVs will convert 2d stuff into 3d.
945720	947280	Oh my gosh.
947280	948920	But a lot of it sucks.
948920	952720	Uh, alpha canandagram says they did smooth the heck out of Zelda 3d.
952720	953720	Well, they better.
953720	958120	I mean, it's going to be on a, it looked like shit if they didn't do something to it.
958120	960020	Steph on the N64 was so fucking ugly.
960020	962200	I don't care how nostalgic you are for the game.
962200	963360	It was an ugly system.
963360	964640	The games on it looked like shit.
964640	965640	It doesn't matter though.
965640	969560	I mean, that system's old and that system was meant for, you know, standard definition
969560	970560	TVs.
970560	972020	And of course you have the scan lines and everything.
972020	976280	So you would better do something to it cause it'll look like crap.
976280	977880	Uh, let's see.
977880	982220	Calfa or excuse me, Kaijuto in our chat room says they make way too many bucks in the video
982220	986120	industry to really care about alpha canandagram 3d.
986120	987440	I don't know why he said it that way.
987440	991960	I think alpha canandagram must've made another comment earlier, but, um, yeah, I was thinking,
991960	992960	wait a minute.
992960	995240	I don't know if the video games industry is necessarily doing that well.
995240	998120	I mean, I know we've heard about the movie industry was in a little bit of a slump this
998120	999120	last year.
999120	1003160	Um, of course there wasn't a lot of great, great movies outside of, you know, like what
1003160	1006700	the Harry Potter and you know, a couple other things here and there, um, that people really
1006700	1007700	wanted to see.
1007700	1011480	But video games, I seem to recall reading a story this week that December did not treat
1011480	1015400	the gaming industry very well, especially if your name was Nintendo, uh, we Nintendo
1015400	1019680	wheat specifically, I guess 3ds obviously is, is, has made a huge rebound, but Nintendo
1019680	1024240	we, as we all figured would happen, what's, what is there on the Wii right now?
1024240	1026960	There was no title for it this Christmas and they paid for it.
1026960	1027960	Well, here's the vape.
1027960	1030520	No, they had fortune street to be fair.
1030520	1031520	They had fortune.
1031520	1033760	Like I said, they had no title on it.
1033760	1038680	This, I mean, apologies if you're a four team out two weeks after Zelda.
1038680	1039680	Okay.
1039680	1040680	So what do you need?
1040680	1041680	That's right.
1041680	1042680	They had skyward sword.
1042680	1049120	I forgot that skyward sword, but here's the, see, it got lost because, okay, but for real,
1049120	1054760	it got lost amongst the Skyrim, the saints road, the, you know, just, it was a huge year
1054760	1055760	this year.
1055760	1056840	Well, here's the thing too.
1056840	1057840	One game wasn't enough.
1057840	1058840	I got it.
1058840	1059840	I got to tell you, here's the thing.
1059840	1062280	The Wii, not a lot of stuff coming out for it.
1062280	1068960	I mean, yeah, they've announced Mario party seven and a rhythm heaven fever, but those
1068960	1071080	are the Nintendo first party stuff.
1071080	1072080	Third party.
1072080	1073840	There's not much for the Wii right now.
1073840	1078640	There's a bunch of games that have been delayed forever that have just still floating around.
1078640	1084000	But I mean, if you look at the release list, as far as Wii titles are concerned, it's pretty
1084000	1085000	dead.
1085000	1089240	And that's kind of a sign that, you know, it's, they're going to stop making Wii games
1089240	1091000	soon enough.
1091000	1093000	I did find it nice or refreshing.
1093000	1098360	I should say that EA has finally dropped the PlayStation two as far as some of their sports
1098360	1099360	games are concerned.
1099360	1105040	They usually do a Madden game, even though, you know, no one's really playing PlayStation
1105040	1106280	two stuff anymore.
1106280	1112680	But they did one last year and actually they did an original Xbox in 2010, even though
1112680	1115720	that system had been done for a while.
1115720	1117280	And the PSP is going the same way too.
1117280	1120580	So the PSP is going to drop off the face of the earth this year.
1120580	1124600	And obviously PlayStation two already is, but I think the Wii is going to drop pretty
1124600	1125600	fast.
1125600	1130360	It's going to be gone by the time the Wii U comes out, or at least, I mean, they may
1130360	1134160	be putting out a couple things, but it's going to go kind of the way the PlayStation two
1134160	1135160	is right now.
1135160	1137320	It's going to be like Disney channel games and you know, just kiddie stuff.
1137320	1141920	Not even necessarily that, it's like really, really small third parties that, and that's
1141920	1148960	all that really have, like, yeah, like Kokum, Oxygen Games, you know, Crave.
1148960	1153800	They have a few games coming out, but they're, I mean, I don't know when they're coming out
1153800	1158400	because they keep getting delayed and delayed and delayed.
1158400	1160200	But it's not anything really mainstream.
1160200	1165400	Although, like I said, Nintendo does have Mario Party 7, which is kind of like eh, and
1165400	1168760	Rhythm Heaven Fever, which I know some people are looking forward to, but it's not anything
1168760	1171520	like a mainstream peel.
1171520	1177000	Mario Party will have a mainstream peel, but Rhythm Heaven, most people could skip that.
1177000	1179040	All right.
1179040	1182720	As if I didn't look like a big enough idiot forgetting about Zelda, I have a little correction
1182720	1183880	to make here.
1183880	1187720	Shane's listening and he's a huge Silent Hill fan and linked me to this thing that's on
1187720	1189120	the Silent Hill Facebook.
1189120	1194240	Apparently, the original voices will still be in the Silent Hill collection for Silent
1194240	1195240	Hill 2.
1195240	1198920	And you're going to be able to switch back and forth between original voices and new
1198920	1199920	voices.
1199920	1205400	But Silent Hill 3 will only have the new voices, but they will be, I mean, in my opinion, 2
1205400	1210600	is the better game, but I know 3 has its huge fans, 3 was a great game too.
1210600	1214980	And they say in their official little release here on Facebook, quote, unfortunately due
1214980	1220520	to factors both technical and logistical, Silent Hill 3 will be presented with new voices
1220520	1221520	only.
1221520	1223400	Yeah, technical and logistical.
1223400	1224400	And legal.
1224400	1225400	Cha-ching!
1225400	1226400	Money!
1226400	1227400	But there you go.
1227400	1228400	All right.
1228400	1231880	Anyhow, okay, enough talk about 3D and all that stuff.
1231880	1232880	Let's move on.
1232880	1236520	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the stuff that we have been playing this week.
1236520	1241280	Usually Dark Soccer starts us off, so I'll let Salacious Pop go.
1241280	1242280	Let's see.
1242280	1243280	I'm sorry, Alan.
1243280	1244280	Yeah.
1244280	1246080	I keep forgetting, you go by your name now and not an online name.
1246080	1248440	Well, it's just, it's too wordy to say over the air.
1248440	1249440	Fair enough.
1249440	1253720	The two big games I'm playing right now, aside from WoW, and I am playing a little bit more
1253720	1260080	WoW than I was, is Skyrim and Dragon Age 2.
1260080	1262800	I'm trying to juggle between the two of those.
1262800	1267800	Since I got the DSi XL for Christmas, I've also been playing, oddly enough, Legend of
1267800	1272480	Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
1272480	1277200	The stylus-only controls are actually really good, they did a good job on it.
1277200	1281120	I have the little feather-shaped stylus as the pre-order bonus, so I got it when it was
1281120	1282120	brand new.
1282120	1283120	And I'm only just now playing it.
1283120	1284120	It's like a five-year-old game.
1284120	1285120	A six-year-old game.
1285120	1286760	But yeah, it's pretty good.
1286760	1291840	Played some Puyo Pop Fever in the car today.
1291840	1292840	So yeah.
1292840	1295880	In Skyrim, I'm at about 40, 41 hours.
1295880	1301680	I've got an orc, he's mace, one hand, and a shield, so he's kind of like a tank.
1301680	1305240	Sort of basic and boring, but at least they just beat up on things and they die.
1305240	1309200	Yeah, about 40 hours, level 25, level 26.
1309200	1312960	And I did cheat to give myself gold because I could not take being broke and always being
1312960	1314200	in my inventory cap anymore.
1314200	1315560	So clearly you're a PC player.
1315560	1316560	Yeah.
1316560	1319360	Have you experimented with any of those mods, like the ones that are supposed to enhance
1319360	1320360	your performance?
1320360	1327040	Yeah, I have a world map replacer that shows me where all the roads are in a way that isn't
1327040	1331160	like all fakie and it's not too obtrusive looking.
1331160	1334880	So I've got a map replacer for the world map, so I don't get quite as lost.
1334880	1335880	Which is cheating.
1335880	1336880	Well, yeah.
1336880	1340120	That is absolutely cheating.
1340120	1341120	Absolutely cheating.
1341120	1343200	If you dodge the giant camps, you're cheating.
1343200	1348200	If you follow the compass, that game will just take you right off cliffs, and I'm like,
1348200	1351040	no, I gotta go, here's the road that goes around, I'm gonna take the road.
1351040	1356200	I find that when it directs me towards a mountain, I just go straight up the mountain, just keep
1356200	1359520	hitting jump and pushing forward and you'll eventually clear that mountain.
1359520	1360520	Attaboy.
1360520	1366360	So yeah, I have a map replacer and the best add-on for Skyrim, and it sucks that console
1366360	1367600	users can't do this.
1367600	1372480	Your favorites, like the spells and the items and the weapons that you put the little star
1372480	1376880	by so you can just do your quick select menu, there's an add-on for that that organizes
1376880	1380520	everything, and then also just a bag manager.
1380520	1385180	So I can sort stuff by weight and see like, why am I always at my weight cap?
1385180	1387600	What the fuck do I have that's so heavy?
1387600	1391800	And then I can sort by, oh, these only weigh a pound, but I have 70 of them, so I can put
1391800	1393800	that at the top and then sell them off.
1393800	1396960	That's what happens when you collect cheese wheels.
1396960	1398780	Yeah.
1398780	1402520	And the bug that I had that I mentioned on last week's show did fix itself, I think I
1402520	1407120	mentioned that too, where everyone in Dragon's Reach hated me and thought I was a murderous
1407120	1411480	criminal, but yet the guards in the town were like, sup bro, what you doing?
1411480	1413520	Like your armor, bro.
1413520	1417040	And then the Jarl and his little dark elf bodyguard were like, fucking get him.
1417040	1418600	And I'm like, I didn't do anything.
1418600	1420200	This game is bugged as hell.
1420200	1422200	Yeah, that's fine now.
1422200	1424840	All right.
1424840	1427800	Vidpower in our chat room says, performance enhancing mods.
1427800	1429280	It's the steroids of Skyrim.
1429280	1430760	Eh, that's a good comparison.
1430760	1436480	Well, I haven't used the dev console in any way to give myself stats or points or skills
1436480	1437480	or anything.
1437480	1441640	Just, I got myself enough gold to buy a house with some chests in it to throw my shit in
1441640	1442640	and that's it.
1442640	1444080	Did you fuck Lydia yet?
1444080	1448640	No, I don't have a, um, I don't have a spouse.
1448640	1451080	You know you can buy the house with actually spending the money.
1451080	1452080	Oh really?
1452080	1456360	See, I don't want to use the exploits or the invisible chest either.
1456360	1459560	I'd rather just give myself 20K gold and then I'm done.
1459560	1463000	Hey, if they didn't want me using that, they could patch that out right away.
1463000	1464840	But apparently they still want me to use it.
1464840	1467960	I think part, part of the fun, I think they realized that part of the fun with the sandbox
1467960	1470480	game like Skyrim is people hacking it and fucking with it.
1470480	1473220	So I don't think Bethesda is going to patch that out.
1473220	1474740	If people are having fun with it, they don't care.
1474740	1476160	It's not an online game.
1476160	1479120	That's probably a big part of the reason why they're not going MMO with it, at least right
1479120	1480120	now.
1480120	1481120	I think it's inevitable.
1481120	1482120	There's an elder scrolls MMO.
1482120	1486040	Oh my God, that would be the buggiest piece of shit ever.
1486040	1488320	It's going to be a beta test for six years.
1488320	1492320	Yeah, right, like they'll beta test anything with that.
1492320	1493320	It's good.
1493320	1494320	You sure?
1494320	1495320	Did you check?
1495320	1498040	Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good.
1498040	1505080	And Dragon Age 2 is awesome, but it's hard to juggle two meaty games like DA2 and Skyrim.
1505080	1507040	All right, let's move on to Loki.
1507040	1508440	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1508440	1510200	My gaming week was pretty good.
1510200	1515040	I just played mainly Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, and Skyrim.
1515040	1520440	Skyrim I'm mainly talking about because no one wants to hear about Call of Duty, Modern
1520440	1521440	Warfare.
1521440	1526680	So I have to say one of the best weapons in the game, I don't know if you've come across
1526680	1529660	this yet, Alan, but the Wabbajack.
1529660	1530920	The Wabbajack is awesome.
1530920	1537320	The Wabbajack is a staff that casts, or it transforms things into random things.
1537320	1542960	So for example, you can cast it on people, and the first time I hit somebody with it,
1542960	1549080	it kind of went all Scott Pilgrim and they exploded into coins, or it turns them into
1549080	1558240	a rabbit, or into a daedra, or a goat, or makes them invisible, or just all sorts of
1558240	1559960	crazy stuff.
1559960	1564680	So that's a pretty fun weapon to mess around with.
1564680	1570920	And then, actually the quest to get that was also really weird, which is pretty fun.
1570920	1576040	But yeah, the game is still really glitchy for me, I just gave up on that one quest that
1576040	1580760	I can't get to the person because they're under the map.
1580760	1585760	Just like, well there's no way to get this person, so to hell with this.
1585760	1594960	And I'm still having fun with it, I'm level 41 I think?
1594960	1599400	Maybe a little further along than that, I don't know, but I think I capped out a few
1599400	1608760	different skills already, my blacksmithing I know, alchemy, and some other stuff.
1608760	1614640	It's still fun, I just didn't play any this weekend, although I probably will tonight.
1614640	1621400	But yeah, still wasting tons of time in that game, I think I have 90 hours in it now.
1621400	1623400	Alright, anything else?
1623400	1627200	No, that's all I play this week.
1627200	1628200	Alright.
1628200	1633120	My Gaming Week, yeah there's really nothing new out right now, so I've kind of been revisiting
1633120	1634920	a lot of older stuff.
1634920	1639040	I fired up PlayStation 3 and I was like, I want to play something that I haven't beat
1639040	1640040	on PlayStation 3 yet.
1640040	1644440	And so I put in 3D.GameHeroes, which is what, about 3 years old, but that was a fun little
1644440	1648040	game, so I put that in to kind of go back into that world.
1648040	1653340	Which if you've never played it, is the Zelda, I don't want to say rip-off, because I called
1653340	1656920	it that somewhere else and somebody was like, it's not a rip-off, it's more inspired by
1656920	1660240	it, and I'm like, okay, but it really is like Zelda.
1660240	1662280	So fine, inspired by Zelda.
1662280	1664240	I'm sorry, I didn't remember one thing I played.
1664240	1665240	Oh, shut up.
1665240	1666240	Very quickly.
1666240	1667240	Alright, what?
1667240	1668240	Mole cart for the iOS.
1668240	1669240	Oh god.
1669240	1671800	Alright, that's coming up in the show later, so hold on.
1671800	1672800	Hold off.
1672800	1673800	Yeah.
1673800	1676880	Alright, let's see, what else did I play this week?
1676880	1682840	I played, I will say on the new front, I did check out that Final Fantasy 13.2 demo, like
1682840	1686240	I think a lot of you guys have, because that's one of the big things that's holding people
1686240	1689080	over right now, that came out on the marketplace this week.
1689080	1694040	I really liked the demo, but of course, you know, disclaimer, I also really liked Final
1694040	1699400	Fantasy 13, and I realized the gamer populace as a whole had its problems with it for being
1699400	1700400	too linear.
1700400	1703280	He was too linear, and there's no towns, and you can only do one thing.
1703280	1707920	Which, and the character design is dah-dah-dah-dah, although if you, I mean, and I get it, I mean
1707920	1713320	I'm not excusing it, but I just will say, if you stick with the game, you will find
1713320	1716320	that Vanille has multiple layers to her.
1716320	1721200	She is not all hee-hee girl, like there is definitely a past there that she might be
1721200	1722200	putting on a front.
1722200	1727040	Like, I'm just saying, if you stick with it for the 25 hours, you will find more about
1727040	1728040	these characters.
1728040	1732080	Hope will get balls later, but the problem is, you know, again, you have to stick with
1732080	1733080	it for 20, 25 hours.
1733080	1734080	And you know what?
1734080	1735080	I can't expect most gamers are going to do that.
1735080	1738000	I need to go and finish Lost Odyssey.
1738000	1741040	That was a fucking great game, and I really wish they'd make a sequel, but they probably
1741040	1742040	won't.
1742040	1743040	But anyway, stop derailing me.
1743040	1744040	I'll be here all night tonight.
1744040	1748080	But, yeah, the Final Fantasy 13 2 demo, in the little bit I played, and obviously it's
1748080	1752600	just a demo, it's a little taste of the game, but they definitely are trying to throw things
1752600	1757580	out there like, hey, look at what we changed from Final Fantasy 13.
1757580	1759680	First off, the Crystalarium.
1759680	1762040	Much easier, and not as big of a pain in the ass.
1762040	1763640	You know, it's much easier to use.
1763640	1768200	Hey, look, townspeople, where you can talk to random people and they'll tell you things
1768200	1771960	and it kind of feels like a town, and you have multiple places you can go.
1771960	1774880	Like, they're definitely trying to sneak all this in the demo.
1774880	1779400	And then on top of that, you know, I found it interesting that your party is actually
1779400	1784360	only two people, and your third character is that monster.
1784360	1790040	And your monster can be one of three monsters, but the monsters all fall into one of the
1790040	1794060	different categories, like Sentinel, or Commando, or Ravager.
1794060	1797200	If you're familiar with Final Fantasy 13, these are kind of the character classes.
1797200	1801320	So it's kind of like a build your own third character, is really what it feels like.
1801320	1805900	To get the types of paradigms that you want, which, you know, I fucking love the battle
1805900	1806900	system in 13.
1806900	1810120	It's one of its huge strengths, and Final Fantasy 13 too is really just expanding on
1810120	1814580	that with letting you kind of even go further with the paradigms.
1814580	1823040	And I know this character has her haters, but I will say Chocolina is amazing.
1823040	1829040	Chocolina's like half Vegas showgirl, half Chocobo cosplayer at a Dinky Automation.
1829040	1833360	It's like Carnaval in Argentina or something, or Rio de Janeiro.
1833360	1835360	It's pretty bad.
1835360	1841880	And she has a voice actor like this, and she just sounds like she's so happy!
1841880	1843280	I was dyin'.
1843280	1847600	And I immediately went on all my Warcraft servers and reserved the name Chocolina for
1847600	1852400	future use, possibly with Pandarins later on.
1852400	1855800	So I guess that was really about it, I'm trying to think if there was anything else.
1855800	1860360	Yes, I went back and started playing Retro Game Challenge on the DS again, because again
1860360	1863160	I was kind of revisiting old games I wanted to play again.
1863160	1869320	And Retro Game Challenge was an awesome DS game, especially if you liked 8-bit classics.
1869320	1871480	That's pretty much it for my gaming week.
1871480	1877080	So let's go to, I'm trying to see if our, in the chatroom at chat.orangelaunchmedia.com,
1877080	1879840	Hitstun in our chatroom says, I thought the full game was out already.
1879840	1881720	January 31st is the full game.
1881720	1882720	Yeah, very close.
1882720	1883720	Same day as Soulcalibur V, right?
1883720	1884720	Yep.
1884720	1885720	It's gonna be a busy week.
1885720	1886720	You're dead also.
1886720	1887720	Ooh, busy week.
1887720	1888720	Busy week.
1888720	1893880	Yeah, it gets, it's weird, it kind of gets busy for, actually starting from the 31st,
1893880	1894880	which is very unusual.
1894880	1896560	February has a lot of big games.
1896560	1897560	All the delayed games.
1897560	1898560	Oh, Mass Effect in February, right?
1898560	1899560	That's March.
1899560	1900560	Oh, March.
1900560	1901560	Wow.
1901560	1902560	Dang, it's gonna, it's gonna get busy.
1902560	1914040	Yeah, it's, February is Binary Domain, Twisted Metal, UFC 3, no I'm thinking, forgetting
1914040	1920600	a ton of shit, SSX, I'm looking forward to SSX.
1920600	1922480	Well, we'll get into the releases a little later.
1922480	1927000	SSA100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchmedia.com says, I never got through disc one of Final
1927000	1928000	Fantasy 13.
1928000	1929000	I really need to finish it.
1929000	1932860	Now, see, I played on PlayStation 3, so it was just one big disc, so I don't know where
1932860	1937680	disc one is in the story, but I will say this.
1937680	1942840	If you can get yourself all the way to chapter 11, chapter 11 is when the game takes a big
1942840	1951000	shift and bankruptcy right kind of I think it's 11 is it 10 or 11 but there's a spoiler
1951000	1955020	alert although the game's been out for how long you do end up on grand pulse and that's
1955020	1959020	when the game really opens up and now you have little side quests you can do and there
1959020	1964560	is a little bit more semblance of a world but I don't it it's not that same feeling
1964560	1968720	like in Final Fantasy 7 when you get out of Midgar and then all of a sudden holy shit
1968720	1974320	world map like it's not that great but I get the sense that Final Fantasy 13 2 is going
1974320	1979760	to start with that kind of chapter 11 feeling right up front and I'm not talking about bankruptcy
1979760	1983520	so I'm really excited about the game I already have my pre-ordered and now I'm realizing
1983520	1987920	shit I gotta get I have to get a PlayStation Vita and I have to get Soulcalibur 5 I'm gonna
1987920	1993240	be broke you don't have to why do you have to get a Vita cuz I want it because he makes
1993240	1999080	bad choices yes because you want luminous right yeah it's not a launch title oh it's
1999080	2003280	not I thought it was nope maybe I'll wait till luminous is out then just give it some
2003280	2007880	time I mean because if they're talking about it bombing as quickly as they think it is
2007880	2013360	you might want to wait just a little bit all right all right we'll see we'll see all right
2013360	2021200	um in fact luminous isn't even on their release list yet for Ubisoft all right let's move
2021200	2026320	on um some quick housekeeping going on tonight of course follow us on Twitter and Facebook
2026320	2031400	twitter.com slash olr or Facebook facebook.com slash orange launch radio you can follow us
2031400	2034720	on there and we'll give you a little previews on what's coming up on the night show and
2034720	2040720	so forth also our website orange launch radio.com we are in early talks about talking about
2040720	2044400	some upgrades for the website for this year's that's really awesome especially the forums
2044400	2048840	we really want to and somebody was commenting on Facebook today about the forums like forums
2048840	2052480	need to get cleaned up we're like yeah we know we really want to make that workable
2052480	2056680	again so I hope you guys will be ready for that when it's done which hopefully will be
2056680	2061300	in the next month that'd be cool and I'm gonna plug the spin-off show Hoard House if you
2061300	2066560	like World of Warcraft we have a whole nother show about World of Warcraft but it's not
2066560	2073400	that serious just like this show hoardhouse.com if you want to check that out h-o-r-d-e-h-o-u-s-e.com
2073400	2077260	think that's everything I want to plug tonight I guess so so let's get into some gaming news
2077260	2083960	Loki I guess actually it's conflicting information Amazon saying it is a launch title but Ubisoft's
2083960	2089100	not whatever um okay so let's talk a little bit about the Vita since we were just talking
2089100	2095400	about the Vita one of the things that was announced during CES was music unlimited was
2095400	2099640	gonna be something that's gonna feature or be featured on the Vita when it launches here
2099640	2106960	in North America and of course that's Sony's cloud-based music service that I think they
2106960	2110960	actually have on the PlayStation 3 right now as well one of the other things that they
2110960	2118120	did announce as well is a kind of a video editor called a play memories and that's going
2118120	2125960	to be for the PlayStation 3 and I also believe the Vita as well which is kind of neat oh
2125960	2132320	maybe only in the ps3 I thought it was also on the Vita and they'll allow you to manipulate
2132320	2137440	photos and videos through the ps3 I thought they had a video editor I thought they had
2137440	2141680	one that came with the eye camera that you could do I thought they had something very
2141680	2146840	basic too but this sounds like a little bit better than that maybe a version 2.0 or something
2146840	2154720	okay and of course some sales numbers came out as well the Vita has sold 500,000 units
2154720	2161880	in Japan and of course they're saying that also we're gonna be expecting Netflix to be
2161880	2168320	coming to it as well near launch on Europe and United States not a big surprise Netflix
2168320	2175520	is on everything so it would be kind of lost if it wasn't on the Vita as well so no big
2175520	2183380	surprise there also the data plans for the Vita if you buy the 3G version have come out
2183380	2190840	18 he's gonna charge you $14.99 a month and this is of course no contract $14.99 if you
2190840	2200880	want 250 megabytes per month and $25 per month if you want two gigabyte cap and honestly
2200880	2204560	I mean since you're not gonna be using 3G to download games because that'd be so fucking
2204560	2212760	slow I would recommend I don't know I'd recommend not getting the 3G version to be honest save
2212760	2218280	some money and just there's some folks in chat room Tiki in chat says I'm going for
2218280	2228000	broke 3G all-in alpha-kinanagram in 3d says getting 3G for the hell of it GPS okay GPS
2228000	2232560	then why not I would just recommend getting enough game like a virgin mobile phone or
2232560	2239100	something like that I pay 25 bucks a month unlimited data it's also 3G and it's a phone
2239100	2248480	so and if you route it you can tether to it so I got 3G anyways but yeah that uh if you
2248480	2253360	want to get the 3G version power more power to eat I guess but that's what's gonna cost
2253360	2260280	you all right I was trying to look up um how the 3ds sold when it originally came out in
2260280	2263240	Japan because I'm getting you know a lot of people are really dogging on the Vita and
2263240	2267200	its sales numbers but how did this compare to the 3ds because the 3ds had a lot of growing
2267200	2272320	pains too you know obviously that was kind of a very slow build so I mean is it really
2272320	2277120	fair to be razzing on the Vita when the 3ds had its share of launch problems I mean not
2277120	2283960	hardware necessarily but you know just quality of software I think I teased you that you
2283960	2287840	want to get the Vita on launch day because it's important to you that they lower the
2287840	2292240	price of the Vita six months later then have an ambassador program where you get fucking
2292240	2295480	crash bandicoot and they're like that's all the vintage shit we have sorry thanks here
2295480	2299560	you go so you can be mad about something else I would hope for a Final Fantasy game but
2299560	2304360	I guess that's the wrong company it's got to be a first party so all right um also go
2304360	2308120	into our chat room at chat.orangeonshoot.com Rama says if you're smart get the Vita from
2308120	2313200	AT&T it'll be $99 with the two-year contract really is that true I didn't hear about that
2313200	2316920	sounds interesting it's price speculation because there's no contracts for it so you
2316920	2321960	know there could maybe there's a arrangement that AT&T could have though uh Rama says tether
2321960	2327160	off your smartphones people uh SGO under Matt says I don't see the point of the 3G since
2327160	2333000	it's Wi-Fi everywhere that's true there's lots of Wi-Fi everywhere I swear my 3DS got
2333000	2336640	on Wi-Fi while I was at the movie like there was an open network and it just kind of joined
2336640	2339880	it because my light was suddenly flashing blue because you know how the light on the
2339880	2344920	3DS is green for I walked by somebody who has a 3DS like mine's glowing green now because
2344920	2349020	it talked to Loki's device obviously and then it glows blue when it's oh I got a swap note
2349020	2355380	from the internet it's interesting all right anyhow let's talk about some PC gaming obviously
2355380	2362460	one big PC game we're gonna get at some point in 2012 is Diablo 3 now there was a very interesting
2362460	2367720	kind of controversy this week with Diablo 3 where Bashyok one of the community managers
2367720	2372480	for Blizzard posted on Twitter essentially that Diablo 3 was confirmed for consoles he
2372480	2378900	didn't say that but he did answer a user question saying oh well that's already in the works
2378900	2384120	and so and so is the manager behind it basically so it pretty much confirmed without confirming
2384120	2387880	it that there is a version in the works but then Blizzard came back and quickly kind of
2387880	2391820	revoked that tweet saying you know we have no announcement on that at this time but come
2391820	2396240	on people we've known for forever Blizzard's been hiring the people for consoles they're
2396240	2402580	at least exploring a Diablo 3 they'll probably do it but my question is with the real money
2402580	2407620	auction house how the hell is that gonna work on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network because
2407620	2411660	I can't see that they're gonna be able to run something like that on those services
2411660	2415580	and that's gonna be a huge money maker for Diablo 3 and essentially fund the whole online
2415580	2421180	multiplayer part of it although I don't know I'm not interested in the real money auction
2421180	2425540	house at all personally but I know some people are thinking they're gonna become millionaires
2425540	2430060	off of it but as we've talked a little bit on Horde house about supply versus demand
2430060	2435780	there'll be plenty of supply but will the will there be demand so sorry to derail you
2435780	2440940	again yeah for good at that tonight by the way yeah I was going back to what you're saying
2440940	2445220	about the 3ds now how often or how far from launch were you talking about for numbers
2445220	2457620	I guess well the couple okay so within the first I'd say week they sold two hundred and
2457620	2464020	I'm sorry it five hundred and eighty two thousand in the US or Japan this is Japan okay all
2464020	2470980	right fair enough so in in about a week so yeah they're a little head all right that's
2470980	2480140	fair so but it isn't millions you know but yeah like hey so yeah because it's a 3ds and
2480140	2485500	long people yeah launched in February or towards the end of February and by the end of March
2485500	2494100	they were about 800,000 yen's in Japan hmm all right so 3ds was ahead all right also
2494100	2499460	in the Diablo 3 front one other thing I wanted to say is that one fact that could be holding
2499460	2503660	up the game or people have been speculating it hold up the game from a global launch that
2503660	2507860	Blizzard is insisted on doing is the ratings in South Korea the game has not been able
2507860	2511300	to be rated in South Korea for forever and a lot of that is because of the real money
2511300	2516860	auction house well the news came out this week that Diablo 3 was officially rated it's
2516860	2522140	rated 18 plus according to the game's rating board page and so that means that now it's
2522140	2528840	been rated everywhere so Blizzard how about a release date unless there is truly something
2528840	2532540	else holding up the release of this game that is highly anticipated anyone else looking
2532540	2536580	forward to Diablo 3 or is it just me of course I'm getting a free one thanks to the Warcraft
2536580	2543380	blood pact but yeah I'm getting it and installing it even if I don't play it just because I
2543380	2548660	signed it for the contract as well yeah it took me a couple weeks but is that they took
2548660	2552140	that down right you can't do that anymore I think you still can in fact it with the
2552140	2557620	news was circulating gaming sites again like I saw it pop up on one of the new communities
2557620	2560780	on live journal I've been following his own TD games because now oh no they didn't as
2560780	2565060	a games community and the story popped up on there like it was new news and it was sourced
2565060	2570980	to do a site that had just run it this week so I think Blizzard is putting it out there
2570980	2575240	again for whatever reason but yeah you can still sign up for it so hey if you want to
2575240	2578300	tell Blizzard you're gonna give them money every month for 12 months I think they're
2578300	2584340	gonna let you do it I just think the rewards are gonna change at some point so and for
2584340	2588460	the record no I'm not excited about Diablo 3 you just but you you never really played
2588460	2594860	Diablo 2 did you I played Diablo 1 I liked I have one why not why not uh the three then
2594860	2600440	I just I don't play that much on PC it doesn't seem like you know right now I'm doing a lot
2600440	2605380	of like kind of looting and grinding and Skyrim and that kind of fulfills my need for Skyrim
2605380	2611340	you know doing looting and grinding I mean I don't need another game to do that Shane
2611340	2615340	by the way looked up the whole luminous thing in private message it's coming up February
2615340	2619500	coming out February 22nd is the release date so it's launch window like that first month
2619500	2624060	it's like go this way it's not on it's not an Ubisoft release list yet I still think
2624060	2629900	that's tentative I don't think that it's actually coming out that day yet I would trust Ubisoft
2629900	2636460	in their information you know because they just sent us the update about Ghost Recon
2636460	2642060	being delayed to May but it's it's not on the release list I will ask this week though
2642060	2646180	because I was curious than that myself especially since they have box art now that usually means
2646180	2651340	that's close and the song list and luminous and well hot and and they could very well
2651340	2657700	say oh yeah here it's coming down the 14th or 22nd or whatever so all right let's move
2657700	2664000	on Alan what do you have for us there is a huge promotional campaign being spearheaded
2664000	2670340	by Microsoft for Xbox Live Arcade called the Xbox Live Arcade house party 2012 and I trying
2670340	2676500	to figure out what exactly this is sounds kind of dippy I guess it's just a huge hey
2676500	2680060	arcade is awesome and we've got great games on it released directly to arcade and their
2680060	2685980	exclusives and rah rah rah let's spend money on arcade games that's pretty much it actually
2685980	2689960	have you heard of the summer of arcade yeah yeah it's the same thing it's the same thing
2689960	2695460	in the winter yeah so the 2012 of the hurrah our XBLA is so awesome it's going to start
2695460	2703900	on February 15th with the titles Alan wakes American night Alan wakes American nightmare
2703900	2711460	the long-awaited I am alive EA's warp and a game that's the name is spelled so confusingly
2711460	2717300	I think it's just deliberately there to troll it's any X you IZ which I'm calling nezou
2717300	2726420	ease Nexus maybe next Nexus yeah I like next to ease though you sound exquisite so yeah
2726420	2731200	those four games we don't really have prices yet point wise on what they're gonna be but
2731200	2735880	February 15th is when those four games are gonna drop and all that goes down and also
2735880	2742320	there's a part of this for Windows 7 mobile operating systems for the Windows 7 phones
2742320	2747020	the smartphones that Windows put out and except for everyone has either an iPhone or an Android
2747020	2751220	so whatever there's also a bunch of games coming out for that as well but you know if
2751220	2757020	you're also among one of those people that plays games for Windows live somebody anybody
2757020	2761580	yeah I still have game room on games for Windows live I don't remember last time I touched
2761580	2768700	it but it's there aren't you glad you bought those games up shut up so yeah X the house
2768700	2776620	party starts February 15th of those four games in is there any by for get one free if I all
2776620	2783300	for those games gets $100 I checked a few sites including major Nelson's blog post and
2783300	2788420	now doesn't really seem that way this one's supposed to be geared more towards teenagers
2788420	2794900	and stuff because hensir edgy commercial that they had in there edgy edgy being that there's
2794900	2799140	teenagers having a house party you know it is because you know everybody has a house
2799140	2803440	party I'm sorry grab the liquor and we're gonna play Xbox Live arcade your house party
2803440	2808660	is invalid with like no no your house party is invalid without kid and play let's be real
2808660	2813160	that is true if you if you want a house party Microsoft if you want a house party people
2813160	2816700	are going to pay attention to you need to find out whatever the fuck happened to kid
2816700	2823060	and play I'm sure one of them is not dead but one of them's got to be alive somewhere
2823060	2827380	and desperate for money I'm going to Wikipedia right now I want to know what happened to
2827380	2832860	kid and play they do have also there's a game from Double Fine coming out for the Kinect
2832860	2836460	that's like I don't remember the fuck they're calling it but it's just a bunch of little
2836460	2842660	Kinect mini games for you know from Double Fine but uh it almost reminds me a lot of
2842660	2848620	that was at the connect where the free shit that they put out fun labs it's like that
2848620	2855740	but paid on June 23 2010 kid and play appeared on Lopez tonight and performed rollin with
2855740	2862000	kid and play from their album to hype at a 2010 Tribeca Film Festival kid stated that
2862000	2870900	play and I also have a television series in the works so the future is bright watch that
2870900	2875300	how fucking older kid and play now let me look at this up here kid kid was born in 64
2875300	2883980	so he's 47 yeah I bet he could still get down also in Xbox news the Microsoft has released
2883980	2890940	the sales numbers which they haven't done since since October and it sounds like 66
2890940	2895900	million units sold worldwide as of this press release they put out and by units they mean
2895900	2903780	stolen Xbox 11 the last time they enough half of them were sold in Poland and we can't figure
2903780	2912060	out why then that's roughly 10 million more than the 55 56 million they said that they
2912060	2918120	had sold worldwide at the end of October so 10 million over one holiday season the Kinect
2918120	2922940	now is at 18 million units which I don't know what the numbers are for the move but I'm
2922940	2927340	pretty sure it's not 18 million well they you can never really get accurate numbers
2927340	2933160	of the move because they count every single accessory you know they sell you the the starter
2933160	2939740	kit oh look we've sold you like you know three move units or four move units number of Kinect
2939740	2948580	games worth it for those 18 million people to it's growing so it's it's slowed down obviously
2948580	2954300	it's plateaued since the insane launch week the Kinect had but 18 million units is a very
2954300	2959900	respectable number also they've come out and said that live accounts that are in service
2959900	2963460	which means that people just configured a live account they log into it not necessarily
2963460	2971280	gold but live accounts is nearly 40 million users which is about 60% of the worldwide
2971280	2977100	sold so 60% of Xbox users have live in some capacity even if it's not gold they're not
2977100	2980620	given them they're not they're not paying for it now where's the number about how many
2980620	2985780	of those accounts are still uncompromised because that's what I'd like to know anyhow
2985780	2991500	so as far as those 40 million silver versus gold it doesn't say but 60% pretty reasonable
2991500	2995340	I think well here's the thing though the numbers are a little skewed there because they they
2995340	2998700	give you the number of live accounts and the number of units sold but how many of those
2998700	3005900	units have died true see that that percentage can be way high that percentage is way higher
3005900	3012340	it's and that's a fact because you know pretty much all the launch units are dead so I don't
3012340	3018340	know that it's interesting vidpower actually links a article he found that's related saying
3018340	3023580	that as part of the house party promotion if you buy all four games you will get 800
3023580	3029900	Microsoft points free which is like what a quarter of a FIFA gold pack so I see what
3029900	3039820	you think 20% there you go all right moving on Loki so of course there was rumors that
3039820	3046860	oh the new systems PlayStation and Xbox are going to be at e3 well it's too soon at least
3046860	3055220	for the PlayStation according to Kazurai PlayStation 4 it will not be at e3 they have no plans
3055220	3064100	on bringing it out at e3 and it says you know we're not making announcements at e3 I do
3064100	3068300	want to just say I told you so last week on the show but to be fair pretty much everybody
3068300	3071260	was thinking that this would be the case it didn't it didn't take a Miss Cleo to figure
3071260	3075020	that out that there was not going to be a PlayStation 4 at this next e3 I think what
3075020	3080780	it's going to be I think it'll be at least a year after and honestly I mean I know that
3080780	3083700	they're kind of like okay whoever's first out of the gate is going to have the best
3083700	3088760	chances as far as it goes I think that Nintendo is going to be stumbling out the gate to be
3088760	3093860	honest and I don't think they're really going to have to play much catch-up and besides
3093860	3097680	give it another year and they can copy whatever works well in Nintendo's system I could sort
3097680	3102780	of see Microsoft announcing a new console but they don't have to like because you're
3102780	3108700	right I think they can give Nintendo a chance to eat dirt a little bit maybe but Microsoft
3108700	3111940	you know especially after the story that Alan just read about that the sales numbers are
3111940	3119020	still good Microsoft still if they could get those like one or two killer connect games
3119020	3122180	you know and I'm talking something better than that Star Wars thing that still isn't
3122180	3126140	out you know if they could get those one or two killer connect titles that even the hardcore
3126140	3129820	gamers like must have I think they're gonna have it now here's here's a real question
3129820	3134980	about Sony and I think this this is a much better question so if you want to play games
3134980	3140500	analyst for a minute those of you listening here's a real question for you how much emphasis
3140500	3145300	will still be on the Sony move this year I think that's a real question asked about E3
3145300	3150780	is that will Sony give up just like maybe they did on the plot well I guess the PlayStation
3150780	3154900	I kind of turned into the move but you know will PlayStation decide to give up on the
3154900	3157900	move a little bit now that they're gonna have the Vita out and maybe we'll focus on that
3157900	3162160	a little more or are they really still gonna push the move it's an alternative to the connect
3162160	3168180	and to the Wii that's that's a question for you I I think well they've kind of succeeded
3168180	3174620	in a few avenues there one they've got better integration with the their motion control
3174620	3181660	stuff into their hard their core games then Microsoft does I mean because hands down you
3181660	3188060	know the move for like resistance and killzone and SOCOM and stuff like that it actually
3188060	3193700	seems like it would work versus voice commands to throw grenade in Halo which seems very
3193700	3199180	tacked on and not very tacked on it is tacked on there were the tacked on crap that they
3199180	3206180	had in fours of four it's just and I have a feeling that even when they do decide to
3206180	3211580	do a core well I don't really know if you can consider a lot of the Kinect games core
3211580	3214700	stuff but the new fable game that's going to be coming out I don't think it's going
3214700	3219620	to be any good okay I have to go to chat room with this comment um Kaiju don't our chatroom
3219620	3225180	says Microsoft needs a new system that thing is dead with all due respect did you not hear
3225180	3230740	what Alan just said like about the sales figures and dude I get what you're saying like I'd
3230740	3234580	like as you know especially after the whole hack crap you know how I feel about the Xbox
3234580	3238740	and I get what you're saying but I think Microsoft let me kind of give you an analogy Microsoft
3238740	3244020	is right now especially with the Kinect sitting kind of where Nintendo was about three years
3244020	3250380	ago where the core gamers like yourself and some of us were taking them so seriously yet
3250380	3254660	they were still slaying with sales figures because the families were adopting them and
3254660	3258860	I think that's kind of where connect is right now like maybe they're losing a lot of core
3258860	3263420	gamers but they're still selling systems and you can't call it dead because they're losing
3263420	3268220	core gamers at all I mean in fact I think that the next working well I did to be fair
3268220	3274380	I don't think they are either but I think the PlayStation 3 is gaining a lot of ground
3274380	3278860	I think it's not that the Xbox is running away with core gamers but I think a lot of
3278860	3284780	core gamers are now looking at the PlayStation 3 going huh maybe I want one of those I don't
3284780	3289940	know just you know in talking to people you know that don't play games as much I hear
3289940	3293700	a lot of well I think I'd rather get a PlayStation 3 coming out of them here's the problem is
3293700	3298220	that they have their whole demographic split in half now the people that really you know
3298220	3302020	are kind of into the casual stuff that are buying the connect and then they have their
3302020	3305660	you know kind of core gamers they're playing you know their franchises and stuff that they
3305660	3311300	keep putting up and they've tried to get people excited they're playing core games to buy
3311300	3317780	the connect you know with Forza 4 stuff and with Halo but honestly it's just such a poor
3317780	3322140	attempt at you know tacking that stuff on that's not really accomplishing what they're
3322140	3327020	hoping to accomplish they're trying to get people to kind of delve into both you know
3327020	3331740	categories they want the core gamers to buy the connect games and they also want the people
3331740	3336840	to play just the connect games and the casual stuff like the Just Dance and whatnot to play
3336840	3341540	more of their you know Halo and stuff like that so they can you know expand the amount
3341540	3346540	of sales that they have it's just it's not working right now because there's what they've
3346540	3354460	done for these core games to implement you know connect functionality is really cheap
3354460	3358620	and it shows I guess going back to the original question about the PlayStation move I guess
3358620	3363800	you will always have those games that are ported to the move from the connect I mean
3363800	3366740	even though the two technologies are kind of different like certainly get the games
3366740	3371860	like Just Dance that they adapt for both I think it's doing well though yeah I think
3371860	3377620	so so all right anyhow let's move on talking about other releases and things coming out
3377620	3381660	another fighting game is going to be repackaged with all the download content and you might
3381660	3387820	have heard it is Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat complete edition of course complete with AK
3387820	3393220	is coming out all over again it is going to have the original game all of the DLC packs
3393220	3398580	so including Freddy it's going to have Mortal Kombat songs inspired by the Warriors is that
3398580	3405460	that old ass CD it might be did it or it might be the new one I don't know they have like
3405460	3411980	a new soundtrack but if it's that old CD that's awesome I don't know also you get a download
3411980	3418460	code of the 1995 Mortal Kombat film which you know was was decent for a video game movie
3418460	3421940	because a lot of them aren't very good but the original Mortal Kombat movie was kind
3421940	3428860	of all right and then the sequel was bad it was bad is really bad show was even worse
3428860	3432260	was there ever a third movie there was talk about a third movie but they just never did
3432260	3436100	it I think they're still doing it all right it's not a little late now well maybe now
3436100	3440700	that the whole resurgence I guess there was a YouTube videos that really weren't they
3440700	3447180	weren't bad so anyhow it is coming out on February 28th the Mortal Kombat complete edition
3447180	3452400	both on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 so if you're like me and you never downloaded any
3452400	3458700	of the DLC this may be a value to you I don't know I probably won't get it I don't need
3458700	3464300	the 1995 film that bad and the DLC if I want it I can probably download do you like renting
3464300	3470820	stuff do you I mean seriously do you guys like renting stuff because because Warner
3470820	3474380	Brothers says fuck you because they don't like people that rent shit they're gonna push
3474380	3481340	the window out to 56 days and also I wonder if there's going to be the online pass for
3481340	3487140	listeners that don't know explain the 36 day window basically Warner Brothers right now
3487140	3494380	they had implemented a 28 day window to basically block anybody that rents movies from you know
3494380	3500660	buying directly from them if they want to buy stuff to put in their store they go out
3500660	3507340	to Walmart or retailer Amazon or wherever and buy them and put them on well technically
3507340	3513700	they they could sell you the product directly later on but you know it's now it's a 56 day
3513700	3523100	window and so Netflix is not gonna have it until 56 days later and but red box you know
3523100	3528660	they're like well fuck it we're just gonna go buy it you know at the store and as is
3528660	3533980	blockbuster blockbusters if those are the big three that were kind of affected by and
3533980	3539580	also you know you may like your Harry Potter well as of last year at the end of the last
3539580	3543460	year they're all out of circulation now if they're they took all the movies out of circulation
3543460	3548380	so they can go re-release them like Disney does basically Warner hates people fucking
3548380	3552180	3d they're gonna release all the Harry Potter movies in 3d wait for it well it wasn't the
3552180	3557300	last one already three Warner Brothers fucking hates they hate people that do not buy their
3557300	3562540	movies they want to basically take everybody to out of rental to buy their stuff and to
3562540	3567860	stream their stuff using their ultraviolet service is what they're looking to do so just
3567860	3572220	saying which isn't gonna work because there's they're diluting it out there is all these
3572220	3576260	all these companies think they can build their own Netflix it's not gonna work just saying
3576260	3581260	you know if that's the kind of thing you want to support then you know by all means you
3581260	3585900	know whatever you know what's fucking work it's Mortal Kombat if you haven't bought the
3585900	3591660	game you mean I don't know just you don't really need all the DLC either I mean that's
3591660	3596340	kind of cheap to sell characters like and Freddy Krueger coming come on and it's not
3596340	3601020	even it's not even the Robert Englund Freddy Krueger it's yeah that that was a Jack girl
3601020	3604740	Haley a bit of a sadness Rama in our chat room says I remember when this shit was going
3604740	3608940	on with VHS movies video stores would get it before everybody else hold on Rama you're
3608940	3612780	talking about the reverse you're talking about the the total reverse what used to happen
3612780	3617180	then I used to work at a video store way back when movie those VHS tapes used to cost like
3617180	3621980	ninety nine dollars when they first came out that's why and so you know rental and sell
3621980	3626740	through they basically had rental rental movies would come out at one point then eventually
3626740	3630780	the studio would drop the price to sell there because I mean yeah you can go buy the movie
3630780	3634260	date the same day that it comes to the rental stores but it's gonna cost you a hundred dollars
3634260	3640980	or one hundred fifty dollars to buy that that movie but then they had program they're Warner's
3640980	3644540	tried a bunch of things they've tried distributing their own movies and that didn't work they
3644540	3651700	tried these programs and trust me working the distribution business it's fun all right
3651700	3660020	let's move on Alan mad cats has released the latest line of the fight stick controllers
3660020	3665220	they're putting out for street for Capcom Street Fighter X Tekken they've done a redesign
3665220	3670180	of it there's two different models now the fight stick pro and the arcade fight stick
3670180	3677420	versus edition the latter which aside from having I think more detailed art on the top
3677420	3684140	panel of it is there is it comes with an accessory if you have two of them you can snap them
3684140	3691200	together and basically make a mock like arcade board where you have two people standing side
3691200	3695820	by side like they were fighting at a real arcade in clay in case you want it so she
3695820	3699300	want to sit a little closer to your friend yeah so if you can find a way to get like
3699300	3703580	a table and put this up up there you can then have two people for like for you know tournaments
3703580	3711700	that you want to host get you to buy two of them instead of one exactly and there's also
3711700	3717940	going to be a fight pad SD which is going to be 15 15 percent smaller roughly than the
3717940	3721900	previous fight pads that they've put out and that they don't have a price point or release
3721900	3727300	date yet for either of these products whether it be the new flight pad or the arcade sticks
3727300	3736100	but they are aiming for a to be congruence with the March 6th release of the game itself
3736100	3741640	and I have a little side story about this all right I remember in February of 09 when
3741640	3745780	Street Fighter 4 came out not super Street Fighter 4 but the original one I wanted one
3745780	3752180	of the fight pads mad cats and I have it right here Rob if you could hand that to me sure
3752180	3756660	I had to go on eBay to find this from one of the large like real like resellers with
3756660	3761260	the thousands and thousands of feedback score it was brand new in the clamshell that you
3761260	3766220	need a hacksaw to open I finally fit this is the only way I could get it they wasn't
3766220	3771220	at Target or Best Buy or GameStop or anything because of how limited quantities they were
3771220	3777820	completely dead out of the box PC won't recognize it and 360 won't recognize it and I paid so
3777820	3783900	much for this so whenever I hear that Capcom keeps giving mad cats their exclusive license
3783900	3791740	for the fight sticks then the arcade whatever I'm like mad cats products suck but that's
3791740	3798220	that's just it happens this stuff comes dead out of the box it can be anything I was gonna
3798220	3802540	say damn it I know it's gonna say Loki if you before I throw it out if you want to fuck
3802540	3807940	with it it's here if you want to take it home and open it I don't know but that's all Loki
3807940	3816100	fix it I know that master Loki read between the line take master Loki fix it he's worth
3816100	3820500	the thing look he's evaluating it well first off you're missing the part that the breakaway
3820500	3827220	part of the cable here oh yeah that's right anyway yeah just go to Kotaku or joystick
3827220	3831780	if you want to see what the fight sticks look like all right let's move on release stage
3831780	3836160	we're gonna travel the world and check out some upcoming releases coming soon to a game
3836160	3840020	store near you besides if he actually wants to play you know super Street Fighter well
3840020	3843540	name is super Street Fighter 4 but Street Fighter 4 in an arcade cabinet I've got an
3843540	3849140	arcade cabinet with super Street Fighter 4 on it with Japanese oh and and an octagonal
3849140	3854740	restrictor plate on my joysticks it's nice and collecting dust because I don't play on
3854740	3863260	it anymore not with the baby around anyways uh releases not a lot I hope you like Gran
3863260	3866980	Turismo and I hope they haven't bought Gran Turismo 5 because that's really that's all
3866980	3872820	coming out this week Gran Turismo 5 again yes Gran Turismo 5 XL Edition it includes
3872820	3879660	now this is kind of cool it includes all the well the spec 2.0 update and a voucher for
3879660	3886520	$20 worth of DLC and it's only 40 bucks okay that's cool so I mean it's not bad I am terrible
3886520	3891700	at like Gran Turismo and the realistic racers but that's that's a good deal that's yeah
3891700	3898020	I mean it's not bad and my pet puppy 3d for the 3ds from 505 games that is it my pet puppy
3898020	3901460	it's funny this week there was actually supposed to be games coming out but nothing came out
3901460	3905100	it wasn't dead week nothing wait what do you mean games are supposed to come out and then
3905100	3907580	they like a bunch of delayed stuff yeah there was two games they're supposed to come out
3907580	3913340	this week and both of them got delayed what games uh this week was supposed to be 41 action
3913340	3918060	packed from south peak or something like that there's a bunch of really terrible playstation
3918060	3923220	our games all right and then there was the National Geographic challenge which got delayed
3923220	3927500	to the 24th you know I'm thinking even if those games were coming out this week was
3927500	3932940	uneventful I'm just just saying just saying all right uh going to Japan oh real quick
3932940	3937620	though one release I wanted to say that's not on this list because it's a Xbox Live
3937620	3944460	thing DLC for Saints Row the third the first in the season pass it will be released this
3944460	3951220	week Genki Bull 7 which I am excited to play all right let's move to the Japanese release
3951220	3955100	dates which are a little more exciting on the Xbox 360 to start us off Dead Rising 2
3955100	3959540	gets a price reduction in Japan I think some folks may be excited about this Oni Chambara
3959540	3964580	Z Kagura comes out this week in Japan so I think this is like a sequel to the original
3964580	3968460	Oni Chambara which if you didn't know what that game was it's basically women with big
3968460	3973780	titties slaying zombies it is a woman wearing lingerie and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword
3973780	3980900	killing zombies that's right how and how like in other words the formula for a perfect game
3980900	3986500	yet it doesn't end up on any end of the year best list it's not really kind of one of those
3986500	3990340	on paper it sounded awesome it's it's part of a simple series the simple series had a
3990340	3996580	really weird they had a lineup of games it was just so some of them were just like casual
3996580	4000720	games some of them were really weird Earth Defense Force was part of the simple series
4000720	4005380	in Japan on the PlayStation 2 this was also part of the series one that I wish that would
4005380	4010500	come over here or at least make a sequel to is zombies versus ambulance it's an ambulance
4010500	4014540	and you run over zombies with the ambulance nails another one it was like some chicks
4014540	4021780	in maid dresses maids with like miniguns killing zombies a lot of zombie killing in you know
4021780	4025660	I like games that are over the top why can't we get more ridiculous why I thought Saints
4025660	4031260	Row was was really awesome actually all right also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week power
4031260	4037340	up heroes and Red Dead Redemption complete edition all those coming out on January 19th
4037340	4041720	heading on over to the PlayStation 3 some of the same stuff Dead Rising 2 Red Dead Redemption
4041720	4045100	complete edition getting the price reductions but there are some new things this week including
4045100	4051140	Nobunaga no Yabu Tendo that is actually again a price reduction as well as Trinity Zill
4051140	4057020	0 0 all of those games I just mentioned PlayStation 3 best hits next big release for Japan on
4057020	4061140	PlayStation 3 is probably Armored Core 5 but that's on the 26th so you still have a little
4061140	4065860	ways to go before that is out keep in mind the PlayStation Vita is already out in Japan
4065860	4070780	so they are getting this week Wipeout 2048 on the Vita makes its way to Japan this week
4070780	4076380	I believe that's a launch title for us over here the Wii really doesn't have a lot there's
4076380	4083100	a price reduction of Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes and I'm quickly looking to see if the PSP
4083100	4092740	or no 3DS Labyrinth no Kannada and Rhythm Kaito R Kotei Napoleon no Isan comes out from
4092740	4099660	Sega this week trying to see if that's a rhythm thief I believe yes it is yeah rhythm thief
4099660	4105060	and the Emperor's treasure it's the Japanese version of that and what about 3D Drive Impossible
4105060	4111940	so kind of a bigger whoa whoa whoa hold on a second who's that from Rocket Company run
4111940	4118420	about 3D Drive Impossible yes runabouts fucking awesome I have not heard of this series runabout
4118420	4123580	it's been around since like the original PlayStation it came out over here as Felony 179 and it's
4123580	4128100	basically a game where you drive around and smash in the stuff with your car and cause
4128100	4132220	damage oh yeah I can see that from the screenshots it looks like you can drive a tank in one
4132220	4137300	of them oh that's a pretty fun game interesting to try that I want to give another second
4137300	4141060	thought very cool Yuki in our chat room says I thought it was a Dreamcast game of course
4141060	4144980	that could be I know it was that could be a delay Yuki might be commenting on another
4144980	4150340	game runabout was also a Dreamcast game I believe as well it was Dreamcast and PlayStation
4150340	4156660	1 maybe PlayStation 2 it was really simple looking graphic well it comes back in 3D this
4156660	4163000	week no it's PlayStation 1 for sure yeah all right let's move on with the UK releases two
4163000	4168980	games all right Wednesday the 18th we're going to get Haunt for the 360 and Scary Girl for
4168980	4174300	the 360 which are download titles so download titles yeah boring week over there in the
4174300	4178780	UK hope you enjoy what you got already and scary girl I guess is a graphic novel tie-in
4178780	4185100	and it's a Squeenix produced game it's a fighting game I believe if I'm not mistaken um Haunt
4185100	4189500	is a not my own shot game the folks that made Parappa the Rappa don't expect it to be a
4189500	4196540	music game yeah it's not a music game I thought scary girl was a fighting game but there there
4196540	4200940	was some other fighting game that was coming out that was like that it might not been scary
4200940	4204700	girl I don't remember all right a couple more news stories for you guys than the classic
4204700	4208060	game of the week I know dark soccer is not here tonight but we still gotta have a classic
4208060	4212220	game of the week so we'll get to that in just a moment Loki all right let's talk about Kid
4212220	4216820	Icarus uprising first off of course you know the circle pad pro will be coming out here
4216820	4221020	pretty soon and the Kid Icarus is going to be supporting that as well they're going to
4221020	4227360	be getting a left-handed mode with the circle pad pro um which looks kind of awkward I don't
4227360	4231780	know how that would be holding that for the record now I'm really pissed off that circle
4231780	4236540	pad pro thing is a GameStop exclusive because Alan's left-handed he could actually use that
4236540	4240620	and you know because I'll probably buy that game and he could kind of use that mode but
4240620	4245940	I'm not going to GameStop period uh I don't know if he would be able to because like I
4245940	4250780	said the the circle pad is off-centered so the system is you know kind of hanging towards
4250780	4255300	the left side so holding it's going to be really awkward it's going to be heavy but
4255300	4260900	that might not be a problem because apparently the you know playing on the 3DS is very awkward
4260900	4265900	and hard on your hands anyway so they're going to be coming or they're going to be coming
4265900	4272660	out with a stand or uh if you will for the 3DS that will be included with Kid Icarus
4272660	4275900	operating because apparently the game is so uncomfortable to play on the 3DS it requires
4275900	4282380	a stand making it not really a portable system anymore but uh yes apparently touching the
4282380	4289320	screen works better if it's secured according to Nintendo that's kind of weird weird to
4289320	4294420	bundle a peripheral like that with Kid Icarus that just to me that screams design flaw right
4294420	4299300	there yeah it's like we have to be getting a new 3DS here's what it is it's because you
4299300	4304900	know you have to touch the screen or whatever and it just doesn't work I mean if you played
4304900	4312780	even Metroid Prime 3D Hunters or whatever it was on the original DS kind of had that
4312780	4316900	same type of setup where you would move with the directional pad and you use your right
4316900	4321560	hand with as you with the stylus to kind of look around and it was fucking uncomfortable
4321560	4326800	to play that game so this kind of the same thing but now you use an analog stick instead
4326800	4331580	um it would be easier if you could aim like if you have the circle pad pro aim with the
4331580	4336980	right analog and move with the left and then you wouldn't need the touch screen but then
4336980	4342580	what's the point now Alan you've um had your share of challenges with the 3DS what do you
4342580	4350020	think about some of this news if you get it I'll use it I don't know you're just not that
4350020	4356260	excited about the 3DS to begin with pretty much I want when they release the second generation
4356260	4361780	of the hardware I will give a shit but I'm a late adopter on purpose I mean Nintendo I mean even
4361780	4367300	just like I'm holding my 3DS right now with one hand um you know kind of moving the analog stick
4367300	4372260	even just holding it for a few seconds is uncomfortable and pushing on the screen as
4372260	4377700	well as I'm trying to it really starts to put a kink in my wrist there I would think they would
4377700	4384260	have to I don't know they'd have to come up with some better way of doing that Mario Kart is the
4384260	4388260	bigger is the biggest culprit because you have to hold down the accelerator and that makes my hand
4388260	4394500	cramp really bad after like one track other games on the 3DS or like the one though the purely
4394500	4399740	stylus based ones are fine but I will bet you anything the next 3DS we get is going to be an
4399740	4404900	XL because the problem right now is everyone's saying it's too small I mean cramps people's
4404900	4408980	hands up that they're gonna make it bigger so they can put the extra analog stick on there and
4408980	4420380	it'll be an Excel system I will bet you all right well moving on speaking of Mario Kart sort of an
4420380	4427980	interesting new game hit the iPhone iOS I touch and all that store this week it's called mole
4427980	4434940	cart and you know it's it's it's kind of common these days that you see these iOS games that are
4434940	4438860	similar to games that are out there in fact you might remember last week we were talking about
4438860	4445340	kind of the same subject with Atari going after all these people well Nintendo may want to consider
4445340	4451180	going after this game because what makes it unique is that while they don't use Mario and that a lot
4451180	4458980	of the characters are different a lot of the tracks are lifted right out of Mario Kart a lot
4458980	4465180	of them all of them all of them are taken right from Mario Kart like the whole bouncy mushroom
4465180	4470540	race thing that was huge on the Wii is in there I mean you know you played this look I haven't even
4470540	4478460	bothered to play it but you actually got it yeah and I got it yeah and bought it and yes it's a
4478460	4484380	complete ripoff of Mario Kart the thing though see I don't like once again I don't like kart racers
4484380	4491660	on the iPod because I just don't like tilt controls it really pisses me off but even I
4491660	4497860	mean look at even the main screen here we have a complete ripoff of the bomb on and the corner
4497860	4503780	there item mode they call it so yeah they break it up there you start off with two characters you
4503780	4508300	can unlock two more by playing the game and you can buy two more on top of that and of course you
4508300	4517100	get mole man and some bear so anyways the different things that they have starting off
4517100	4523220	you have the mole pasture which I want to say it's one of the tracks from the Wii game I don't
4523220	4529780	remember it's but basically they've replaced just some of the stuff in there and then X mushroom
4529780	4538860	which it's definitely one of the tracks from the game the then you can unlock the fridge a port
4538860	4545460	which is it's definitely one of the tracks from the Wii game volcano which is one of the old
4545460	4552060	classic tracks the Bowser castle tracks from the Super Nintendo game that they remade the 3d and
4552060	4562340	the Wii version that's in there sky remnant is another track the I think you can buy and then
4562340	4571140	Arctic glaciers and one of is the the ice track from Nintendo 64 version that was up rezzed and
4571140	4575340	then moles garden was peaches I think it's peaches garden or something like that or daisies garden
4575340	4580700	so in other words it's a damn ripoff yeah they'll all everything's a ripoff so rather than being
4580700	4586740	just it's the same genre cuz last week you were saying that companies go after third-party things
4586740	4590740	that say oh you're you're copying our game but it's like no it's just the same John right copy
4590740	4595900	the tracks the tracks are the same so this would be a valid lawsuit yes this be all the power-ups
4595900	4600700	are you know oh this is not quite a bullet bill it's something different but all the power-ups
4600700	4604700	are the same I mean they have all the power-ups but doesn't the quality of stuff like this kind
4604700	4611300	of speak for itself it's not bad I mean it's interesting all right I mean you can take a look
4611300	4616780	at it orange right in our charm says they just released a Smurfs village ripoff called moles
4616780	4622900	world how the hell do I play this I mean it's automatic acceleration you have a break and then
4622900	4628660	you till I'll move I just moved backwards should I hold your mic up to your face for you okay hold
4628660	4635780	the air sure I'm playing this any type basic how do I how do I use a little question yeah you tap
4635780	4645220	the item to okay I just got a flaming pair as a power-up and there's cows standing in the middle
4645220	4649060	of the course just like on the wee one and the flame pairs I'm assuming are like the mushroom
4649060	4655060	yeah because they gave me a little turbo boost and I can't drive for shit this game I mean it's
4655060	4659500	one of those things where it's like I would show my friends haha look at this Mario Kart ripoff but
4659500	4666340	I mean is it really worth what is this a pineapple okay it's an oh it's the it's the use it all you
4666340	4675780	want nitro the frame rate on this sucks Moo Moo Meadows yes Moo Moo Meadows it's even on the
4675780	4687180	fucking banner it says Moo Moo Meadows on the fucking banner you know I'm thinking the developers
4687180	4693500	kind of forgot that you might want to change some things that are on the track way to go can I turn
4693500	4698060	that I'll turn that off it's too nose I'm pressing the button shutting it off right speaking it's
4698060	4702580	making Rob angry angry because I've actually been playing Mario Kart 7 and I'm like at least that
4702580	4707860	game has a decent frame rate yeah Moo Moo Meadows is uh I believe it is one of the tracks where did
4707860	4711940	I do it do and when you come up to the it's from our car we it's on the banner it says Moo Moo
4711940	4721060	Meadows like idiots ah that's that's that's fantastic because you know you know they're
4721060	4726960	doing it in some you know very tiny cubicle high production supervisor glaring down everyone's
4726960	4733180	next environment where they just got it's it's just take this track and copy it you know just
4733180	4743160	bit by bit detail by detail and so they copied it that's fantastic good job all right let's take a
4743160	4747220	moment to take a trek down memory lane remember remember when the only game that was getting
4747220	4754700	ripped off with Street Fighter 2 fighting street let's take a trip down memory lane remember in
4754700	4760780	the groove all right every week dark soccer likes to dive into the vault and pick a game that she
4760780	4765620	thinks is worthy of being the classic game of the week but she's not here so instead of the classic
4765620	4771680	gaming vault we have the classic gaming cardboard box and Alan has dived in thumb first into the
4771680	4777260	classic gaming box and pulled out a game that he thinks hey show some respect this is a true
4777260	4783100	classic right here Alan what is the classic game of the week this week this week's classic game is
4783100	4790420	the original half-life I'm so released 1998 I'm so surprised at this coming from you yes I know
4790420	4795780	that's right yeah it's never been a classic game of the week and reality check this game is what
4795780	4804780	yeah 13 years old at this point yes yeah half-life was made by two former Microsoft employees Mike
4804780	4813140	Harrington and Gabe Newell whose name might ring a few bells they bought a the package to modify
4813140	4818740	the quake engine and they hacked the shit out of it to design this game and by the time they were
4818740	4824940	done the quake engine had grown into something called gold source which is how source which was
4824940	4830340	the big engine that half-life 2 and left 4 dead is based off of that's how they got that name so
4830340	4836140	the original half-life was a modified a quake engine game it was published by believe it or
4836140	4841620	not Sierra entertainment or what Sierra online had become before it finally closed after you
4841620	4846380	know that after they made all the King's Quest and Space Quest games so yeah developed by valve
4846380	4852380	you know a little company you might have heard of published by Sierra online and it was released
4852380	4861620	November 19th of 1998 on the windows PC platform and of course anyone who remembers the 90s know
4861620	4867540	that as far as first-person shooters go there were the two big titles Wolfenstein 3d which set
4867540	4874980	the place for doom which at the place for Duke Nukem 3d what half-life did differently and how
4874980	4882540	how it got so much critical acclaim was the storytelling which was done through the map
4882540	4890460	while you were playing also it was a continuous like doom and hexen and Duke Nukem 3d there was
4890460	4894340	a there was a final checkpoint of the stage where you have to hit the button or go through the door
4894340	4899860	and it says you have completed here's the par time here's your time yeah half-life was just like a
4899860	4905680	big I mean it just kept going and going there were a little chapter marks so when you got to a
4905680	4911340	certain plot point in the game and you uncovered a new area a subtitle would say you know chapter
4911340	4915860	two office complex so you know that you're progressing through the story but other than
4915860	4924020	that it was like a big ant farm you were in Black Mesa which was a military industrial private firm
4924020	4933460	that made like nuclear weapons for the government in Arizona and you play Gordon Freeman a physicist
4933460	4939780	who is doing an experiment on some alien moon rock that is given to him in strange circumstances and
4939780	4946660	when he does a test on it a dimensional rip from an alien world hostile alien world opens in all
4946660	4953740	these aliens pour out and it turns out that they were working on portal technology like game portal
4953740	4961780	which came much later and while developing this portal stuff they accidentally tapped into an
4961780	4971780	evil alien overworld and critters showed up and oh no it was critters yeah it's one of the best
4971780	4979020	rated first-person shooters of all time I think it's got a 97 or 98 on Metacritic the other big
4979020	4986660	thing which was unprecedented at the time was that the marine soldiers that come in and like in
4986660	4992540	chapter four or five to kill you it they actually had an AI believe it or not because the demons in
4992540	4998060	doom and the aliens in Duke Nukem 3d were pretty dumb you know you you could hide behind cover you
4998060	5005260	just run out and shoot them in half-life if you duck for cover the computer would know to tell
5005260	5010420	the the NPCs to then throw a grenade and the aiming on the grenade was accurate so you'd be
5010420	5015940	hiding behind a box or around a corner and you would see a grenade it's like oh shit and no one
5015940	5022180	had ever played a game that hard before where you had to actually think about how to go about
5022180	5027900	killing your enemies half-life was also very different where there wasn't really multiplayer
5027900	5033820	which was really big in that day or was there like co-op I don't there it came later there was um
5033820	5039740	there was half-life deathmatch and also counter strike which is the biggest that was the that's
5039740	5045580	also a hack of the gold source engine but when valve opened up the game as it was released did
5045580	5049700	not have your quake style multiplayer your Duke Nukem 3d correct that's kind of interest that
5049700	5054420	came later it was still so successful without that component I mean granted it came later and
5054420	5057980	now you have also you know valve is very well known for that stuff but it wasn't a part of
5057980	5064140	the original game and the opening of half-life is Gordon Freeman getting into the tram to go
5064140	5069540	it's in the morning he's going to his day at work and it's you don't really get to control your
5069540	5074500	character at all it's about a two or three minute intro where you're just on this tram going through
5074500	5079620	the Black Mesa facility and what it's kind of doing is showing you the game like this is what
5079620	5084100	you're going to be dealing with once shit goes down there's a part where you kind of are crawling
5084100	5090140	through the Grand Canyon and skilling all these cliffs and you'll see the sewers and then finally
5090140	5094700	the tram stops and it lets you out and a first-person shooter had never really tried to
5094700	5100620	do storytelling in that way before the designer of Bioshock if you remember the intro of Bioshock
5100620	5106060	where you the plane crash lands and you're in the water and you go into the lighthouse and you're
5106060	5112220	in the bathysphere and you see rapture the city that is inspired by the tram sequence in half-life
5112220	5119100	they've just said that it's exactly a direct homage to what half-life did there were a few
5119100	5123100	flaws of course with half-life and there were a lot of bullshit weapons in it that you never
5123100	5129500	use they're like 15 different weapons you only needed like five of them way too long especially
5129500	5135100	since the last chapter of the game you actually you go to the alien world to kill the big brain
5135100	5144260	fetus that part was really ugly and it had a lot of first-person platform we have to jump on shed
5144260	5149820	or else you fall off and die even today in 2012 you put jumping puzzles in a first-person shooter
5149820	5154180	people like fuck now this is stupid I don't want to do this half-life near the end of that of its
5154180	5163700	cycle had a ton of that stuff so it wasn't without its flaws I believe it's also one of the as far
5163700	5169860	as PC exclusive shooters the best-selling this made along this may not be true any longer but
5169860	5175060	there was a point where if you bought a new sound card you got a copy a free copy of half-life you
5175060	5179740	bought a graphics card or a new computer like you got a circuit CD you get the package deal well now
5179740	5185540	it's download game and half-life will cost 50 cents at some point yeah so an absurd amount of
5185540	5194900	millions of units sold of this game and half-life 2 of course came out in 2004 launched the steam
5194900	5199700	store platform which of course no one knew at the time what the fuck that was and now steam is
5199700	5206700	totally integral to PC gaming and without any of this we would have never had portal yeah or portal
5206700	5213220	to our game of the year this yeah aperture science which is the main company and portal is hinted at
5213220	5218460	as being in bidding wars with the government against Black Mesa and always losing so they're
5218460	5223220	kind of like the shitty little kid brother of Black Mesa anything else you say about half-life
5223220	5229020	it's awesome I do a full playthrough of it at least once or twice a year it's hard as hell I
5229020	5234700	can't honestly beat it without using a god mode code for at least some parts of it but it's
5234700	5239180	definitely awesome and if you like first-person shooters you want to know you want to know what
5239180	5245300	all the hype is about when people lose their shit about where is half-life 3 god damn it play this
5245300	5251500	and figure out okay I can see why I want more of this but do keep in mind the game is you know 12
5251500	5257580	years old at this point yes so but there's been newer versions you know there's a fan community
5257580	5264740	project it's pretty much vaporware called Black Mesa source which was it's not related to valve
5264740	5270260	at all but the valve is absolutely given it it's given them their blessing a complete reskin of
5270260	5277980	half-life with completely redrawn textures like a total remake of it that hasn't come out yet and
5277980	5283600	it's been planned for like five or six years all right well that's gonna do it for our classic game
5283600	5291780	of the week this week half-life released originally in 98 for the PC get your crowbars all right all

5330860	5335980	o'clock Eastern right after Bobby Black Wolf and we've talked a lot in part 8 tonight we talked
5335980	5341060	about Diablo 3 we talked about the Mortal Kombat complete edition we even talked a little bit about
5341060	5346420	kid and play who haven't been around since what the 90s but apparently they are still there one
5346420	5351260	thing I wanted to mention at the top of the segment here in part B an announcement of sorts
5351260	5356020	that we're gonna make tonight is you might remember one thing we're pimping and pimping
5356020	5360860	and pimping here on the show towards the end of the year last year was home loud which of course
5360860	5366700	is a fundraiser that happens in the Bay Area San Francisco which is a fundraiser for the child's
5366700	5373940	play charity which made well let's let's be real a shit ton of money this year for a good cause it
5373940	5377500	seems like it's doubling every year which is amazing I think the final tally was somewhere
5377500	5382740	around like $26,000 I might be misquoting that a little bit I don't have the number in front of me
5382740	5386500	but it made a great amount of money for charity which is awesome well the reason why I bring it
5386500	5392500	up again is because the official pre-show which I was asked to be a part of and I'm very thankful
5392500	5397860	I was a part of that is now posted up on YouTube for everybody to check out so I will paste the
5397860	5402620	link in chat there for you guys if you haven't already seen it because I know it was out on the
5402620	5407020	umlaut Facebook and stuff earlier or for those of you guys listening on the podcast just just head

5423060	5428260	home they're from umlaut I do ask if you are gonna watch the hour and a half long pre-show
5428260	5435500	for about the first 20 minutes just skip all the segments have me until about about 20 minutes in
5435500	5439340	because unfortunately there was some audio snafu and I think I have a Jessica Simpson moment but
5439340	5445500	you know what it's live things like that happen we've had our share of lol wtf moments here on
5445500	5449820	orange lounge radio like remember when the entire sound board fell over that was a good time so
5449820	5453860	anyhow big thanks once again to umlaut for asking me to be a part of that including of course the
5453860	5458820	wonderful seg who I think is in our chat room I saw him there earlier hello seg and the other guys
5458820	5464240	that put the pre-show together the whole folks of the AV society very professional folks and my
5464240	5471740	fellow co-hosts on that show carnage and Wes both from destructoid were great and did very well with
5471740	5477820	all the interviews and everything so lots and lots of interviews and folks okay so again that's
5477820	5483140	YouTube user umlaut SF and by the way you can still donate so you can still if you forgot if
5483140	5487460	you're like oops I meant to donate but you know it was December was a rough month well you can
5487460	5491740	still donate so I don't think it'll go to this year's tally but it will go to a good cause and
5491740	5496460	that's the very important part all right let's move on with some rapid-fire news some other game
5496460	5503300	news going on there this week Loki yes so let's start things off talking a little bit about Saints
5503300	5507260	Row the third this is kind of cool this is something that I know I heard about a while ago
5507260	5514620	it was announced by chief s gamer because involves cheap ED but cheap ED is gonna be in Saints Row
5514620	5523100	the third as a homie that you can actually get to back up your your gang member in missions which is
5523100	5528420	kind of cool you can actually download him as either part of gank people sevens DLC which is
5528420	5535060	gonna cost you seven bucks or free if you happen to you know have the season pass or you can get
5535060	5541740	it for free using the gank people seven viewer pack which allows you to get all the DLC portions
5541740	5550220	to be able to play co-op with someone that has that DLC if you choose not to buy it and of course
5550220	5553580	the only catch is that you need to get to the point in the game where you're at the first save
5553580	5559020	house which you know doesn't take that long because that's when you homies but uh even I'm
5559020	5563180	at that point yeah I mean if I could play that long if a game can hold my attention that long
5563180	5567100	you can do it it's pretty awesome and he does have a bunch of unique lines apparently in the
5567100	5572580	game we got popcorn over here would you like popcorn it's plain popcorn though it's that's
5572580	5578340	fine it's gross it's pretty bad popcorn right I eat low fat or the low butter popcorn sometimes
5578340	5584860	of course I couldn't find that the source I have regular butter now haha all right oh well it is
5584860	5589740	playing yeah apparently it's all the hell out of that what I heard about cheap ED I think he won
5589740	5595140	some type of auction thing and oh yeah maybe yeah it was like a charity thing I knew about that
5595140	5603620	auction I would have paid like $2,000 or something to do it so um I don't know if it made the news
5603620	5607040	tonight because I think it might be kind of late-breaking and I really apologize I'm like
5607040	5612660	scanning over the upcoming stories there's rumors going around about thq that apparently they're in
5612660	5617380	trouble right now and they're selling off or something about all of the projects coming out
5617380	5622020	in 2014 for thq have been cancelled and I think they're trying to prepare the company to be sold
5622020	5628100	I don't think they're in trouble mm-hmm pretty good I mean where does a rumor like that come
5628100	5634060	from industry insider well I know that but like who would make something like that up that's a
5634060	5639820	weird rumor to make up well it's still ways off I mean 2014 I mean I don't know maybe they're just
5639820	5649740	who they bought by I mean EA or Activision who else who else buys up gaming companies all right
5649740	5654500	anyway I'm sorry because I don't see them like kind of going that way right now because I mean
5654500	5660820	how other companies have worse I have a worse time than they do I mean sometimes you get surprised
5660820	5666580	PopCap why did PopCap sell they were doing great I mean you look at Capcom Capcom didn't do that
5666580	5671940	great I mean they have Street Fighter Marvel vs. Capcom but I don't think that would sold tons I
5671940	5678540	mean they really have any big games and I mean Warner Brothers had Batman so that helped but
5678540	5685620	they didn't have bad you know Harry Potter and Lego Harry Potter yeah I don't think so all right
5685620	5694580	let's move on all right and some other cool stuff Dark Souls there's hopefully chance that it'll be
5694580	5704460	coming to PC and of course the admin for the Dark Souls game they responded to a request for a PC
5704460	5709580	version and basically said there's always a possibility to have games adapted on PC and the
5709580	5715860	good news is Dark Souls is not a 100% typical console game so the option is possible now to
5715860	5722100	make things happen let's say the demand has to be properly done someone make a successful petition
5722100	5729700	and so there is a petition right now you can sign it it has currently around 37,000 signatures and
5729700	5738180	if it hit some arbitrary number then maybe they'll be a Dark Souls PC game which would be kind of
5738180	5747140	neat and last but not least Silent Hill Silent Hill it was supposed to be coming out earlier
5747140	5754100	in 2011 of course downpour has been delayed to March and that is where you're gonna be able to
5754100	5760580	find a lot of Silent Hill games this year Silent Hill downpour of course coming out on March 13th
5760580	5770100	I'm sorry March yeah March 13th and then the HD collection will be coming out on March 6th and
5770100	5776060	then on the Vita a book of memories will be coming out March 27th so it's a whole month
5776060	5785100	full of Silent Hill whether that be a good or bad thing all right we talked a little bit about
5785100	5790220	Silent Hill already earlier in the show what another movie to another movie but I mean
5790220	5795780	they announced it wasn't terrible the first one it was alright I really like the first movie yeah
5795780	5804540	it's good just man the games that last game that they put out was not very good and this one I'm
5804540	5810380	not sure if it's gonna be very good either and I don't know if was it frozen memories was not the
5810380	5815980	one of the Wii I don't know if that was any good either hmm it was a lot of running all right
5815980	5822460	moving on this isn't necessarily about video gaming but it's about a game that like influences
5822460	5827460	a lot of shit in video gaming and that is Dungeons & Dragons and there's some big news this week
5827460	5832820	about Dungeons & Dragons it's a little bit controversial Wizards of the Coast is working
5832820	5836500	on a new edition of Dungeons & Dragons which is kind of weird to me in a way like it seems like
5836500	5840580	they're they're pumping these out faster than versions of Google Chrome all of a sudden like
5840580	5845820	wasn't the original version of D&D in the 70s and then they had one in the 80s or like no
5845820	5852060	wouldn't second edition was all the way in the there was D&D and then there was a D&D okay and
5852060	5855980	then they consolidated those two brands so they're kind of what there was a tricky other version in
5855980	5861020	there yeah okay so whatever but it seems like you know it goes at least every seven years but we how
5861020	5864380	long ago is fourth edition fourth edition was just a few years ago right cuz I remember all
5864380	5868580	the comparisons to World of Warcraft yeah well apparently they're working on another one which
5868580	5872820	you don't find that's that's fair and you know D&D always has room to evolve and get better and
5872820	5879820	so forth but the fifth edition of the game is apparently seeking user input quote we seek to
5879820	5885980	build a foundation for the long-term health and growth of D&D one rooted in the vital traits that
5885980	5889940	make D&D unique and special we want a game that rises above differences of play styles campaign
5889940	5893460	settings and additions one that takes the fundamental essence of D&D and brings us to the
5893460	5897940	forefront of the game in short we want a game that is as simple or as complex as you please
5897940	5903340	it's action focused on combat intrigue and exploration as you desire we want a game that
5903340	5908420	is unmistakably D&D but one that can easily become your D&D the game that you want to run and play
5908420	5912460	that is from their official announcement that they sent out earlier this week and they say by
5912460	5918220	involving you in the process we can build a set of D&D rules that incorporate the wants and desires
5918220	5923620	of D&D gamers around the world so they are going to I guess at least are claiming that they're
5923620	5928020	going to be user input in a lot of features of this game wasn't there supposed to be a lot of
5928020	5935820	user input Mega Man Legends 3 2 and look where that got womp womp no but I'm not you know
5935820	5940660	obviously D&D is a classic game but gonna be very interesting to see what direction it gets taken
5940660	5946900	in I mean you would think the people that play it regularly would would know a lot but sometimes I
5946900	5952540	don't know like I go to World of Warcraft which obviously heavily influenced by D&D right World
5952540	5959580	of Warcraft almost listened too much to its vocal fan base in this latest one like Cataclysm really
5959580	5963540	kind of catered to a lot of the very vocal people and because of that it's the weakest expansion
5963540	5968340	and then suddenly everyone hates this expansion including those vocal people so I'm just saying I
5968340	5974820	know it's a little you know weird to say on the show where every gamer has a voice but you gotta
5974820	5978300	you gotta balance it I mean there's still some decisions you're gonna have to make with that
5978300	5984500	that's why they're fans and not game developers yeah so all right spazinator says my input D&D
5984500	5989900	needs more T&A I don't know what circles you're playing in but you might want to I'm sure there's
5989900	5995980	plenty of people that will be games had planned T&A I mean there's I can't tell you how many
5995980	6004180	times we went all the problems on the roll for whatever exactly I want to get drunk if there's
6004180	6011500	any chicks there I want to do them all right also the Simpsons arcade game is coming to Xbox 360 and
6011500	6017380	we absolutely know this now because some of the achievements have leaked to the Xbox 360
6017380	6023300	achievements org website one of them is called mr. sparkle and what's interesting about that is
6023300	6029900	that the components of the mr. sparkle achievement say from stage one make it to stage three bosses
6029900	6036780	in survival mode within the Japanese ROM so that is spoiling of sorts the fact that in this Simpsons
6036780	6041740	arcade game that's gonna come out on 360 you're gonna be able to play the original or us I guess
6041740	6047580	ROM but you also get to play the Japanese ROM apparently the Japanese ROM has lower difficulty
6047580	6054140	more health items more points and the ability to jump while holding a weapon very interesting so
6054140	6059780	that's gonna be in that release and lastly kind of some rumors going around this is big big rumors
6059780	6065260	but apparently retro studios which is one of the big nintendo developers right what a retro studios
6065260	6072980	do did they did they do that on okay Donkey Kong they have made a hire from uncharted 3 developer
6072980	6079180	naughty dog and apparently somebody from Darksiders staff so they're bringing in some folks from the
6079180	6086580	UM you know big releases over there Eric Kozlowski who used to be with naughty dog has said that this
6086580	6090940	new project is well let me just read the quote here quote I'm going to work on another project
6090940	6095940	that I am super excited about I can't talk about it too much but if all goes well it might just be
6095940	6102700	one of my crowning achievements as an artist it's another Zelda game you think yeah because they've
6102700	6111660	already you know they you know put for some effort into making stuff for Mario Kart and I think that
6111660	6116900	they were you know they've been commented about saying no hey we'd love to get our hands on Zelda
6116900	6122780	I think it's a Zelda like spin-off or something like that new like type of Zelda game well Zelda
6122780	6127820	or not it could be very interesting to see what this is because this could be that big announcement
6127820	6133480	at e3 like here is what the core gamer is gonna want to Wii U for yeah but see here's the thing
6133480	6139820	though remember when they said the same thing about Metroid other M how did that do it just
6139820	6149060	like tanked I mean so I don't know why the other M wasn't terrible it tanked it take no no I don't
6149060	6153300	any wrong yeah game itself wasn't no it's not terrible that's the problem though there's a lot
6153300	6158500	of not terrible games that come out and they're pretty decent like you know mad world or even
6158500	6167260	uh conduit or you know some of the other ones out there and killer and not killer seven but no more
6167260	6173420	heroes those are not terrible games but they don't sell and fuck if you can't sell a Metroid game on
6173420	6180700	them on a Nintendo system you got problems all right let's move on with some more rapid-fire
6180700	6188220	news Allen for those who remember the XCOM franchise from the 90s the company named for
6188220	6193420	axis I do showed up at e3 last year saying that they were gonna bring back the franchise I
6193420	6198700	completely missed the XCOM train when I was in junior high in high school well if you ever won
6198700	6202720	I had the entire XCOM collection I bought on Steam for like four bucks which has like five
6202720	6208540	XCOM games they were pretty awesome I just old ones were they got really old ones were so they've
6208540	6216100	we haven't seen much about the FPS version of the XCOM game under or rather under the XCOM license
6216100	6222060	that for axis is bringing back and that's because that it's being pushed to 2013 has been canceled
6222060	6226980	I guess maybe they're having problems imagining how XCOM would function as an FPS but they're
6226980	6233300	still developing it they just need more time however the XCOM strategy reboot which I guess
6233300	6240140	is more here here's more to what XCOM originally was is still on board for a 2012 release they've
6240140	6247620	also renamed the game to XCOM forever go figure okay this has it here is XCOM enemy unknown so
6247620	6252740	it's like Duke Nukem forever I'm trolling I'm tired it was like a low flying jet over my head
6252740	6266180	it was a bad Joe is bad going over me also so next quick fire story is there's a game that was put
6266180	6271980	on Kickstarter which is like I have a great idea and please fund my project I only need five grand
6271980	6278860	and me and my friend will design this and blah blah blah a game called Oregon Trail not Oregon
6278860	6286740	the state but Oregon like a kidney Oregon Trail director's cut a success on Kickstarter so it's
6286740	6291300	going to be a zombie filled spoof of the Oregon Trail where I guess you've got a map and you're
6291300	6296020	trying to survive getting from point A to point B destination where of course the big stronghold
6296020	6302660	is that is keeping the zombies out and they they met their Kickstarter goal so hopefully that will
6302660	6309660	be developed and released and I want to have a grand old time and this image here it looks like
6309660	6314020	they've got some pixelated Sean from Sean of the Dead and some of the characters from Zombieland
6314020	6321260	and sort of a apple to ease sort of the color graphics that Oregon Trail had good times yeah
6321260	6329700	so yay for Kickstarter and indie games last story I have is that there is a unofficial patchwork
6329700	6341020	GLaDOS GPS voice sound pack that's awesome turn left you moron and it looks like the files should
6341020	6346820	work with the Garmin mobile XT units I was thinking maybe it might be TomTom because they're the huge
6346820	6354500	sort of standalone GPS because they have a ton of voices like you get a James Earl Jones and Samuel
6354500	6363340	Jackson yeah this yeah this here had lists yes there is a Samuel Jackson motherfucker can you
6363340	6375060	do it seriously that is it there's mr. T there it's got to be a macho man savage one I don't know
6375060	6383740	go straight six miles oh yeah let's see destination on the left boy no I know they have like a Darth
6383740	6390300	Vader one Tom Tom voices let's see here Wow you know I kind of need a GPS here you go here you go
6390300	6397100	Marge Simpson that's one of the newest ones that they're highlighting now I kind of want a GPS that
6397100	6403460	might be kind of fun Homer Simpson Roger Moore Kim Cattrall kit Kim Cattrall Kim Cattrall fuck
6403460	6409260	would you want Kim Cattrall doing your Yoda like it's just her howling from Porky's even my mother
6409260	6417060	would be like the fuck is this Yoda Han Solo SpongeBob SquarePants C3po Yosemite Sam Bugs Bunny
6417060	6428380	Dora the Explorer Darth Vader where some of the other funny ones here the fuck is that man I don't
6428380	6435180	understand I don't even know Burt Reynolds I've heard the Burt Reynolds one Billy Connolly Dennis
6435180	6441820	Hopper all right anyway Dennis Hopper has been dead how long if you have a Garmin mobile xt I
6441820	6446420	guess any of them there's a whole line of them go under reddit and look this up because it's a it
6446420	6451140	was posted to reddit I guess it's reddit people that piece this together but yeah GLaDOS in your
6451140	6457260	car telling you how to get to Walmart Daria some of the folks in our chat room Rama says GLaDOS
6457260	6465420	is already on TomTom so I guess this is some new thing so whatever all right that still sounds kind
6465420	6471740	of awesome to me all right let's move on Loki I'll stop looking at voices um of all these dead
6471740	6477300	celebrities and can there are a lot of dead people on there and some people that should be dead
6477300	6486740	you're mean but anyways uh CES they showed off a few things obviously a lot of TVs including some
6486740	6495260	new smart TVs or web-enabled TVs that have a guy time and on life support guy kind of course coming
6495260	6502180	to some brand new LG TVs and you'll be able to stream games straight to the TV using the
6502180	6512380	interface on there also coming to Google TVs would be on live service and I'm guessing they'll allow
6512380	6519740	you to purchase the universal controller and stream stuff straight to the TV which you have
6519740	6528100	to use their player app for that no word on what other devices maybe you know the stuff will be
6528100	6533340	coming to but it's kind of neat that someday you'll be able to get TVs that stream games
6533340	6541580	straight to them and I mean if you think about it you know really these consoles if you will
6541580	6548300	will never go away because they just keep updating the hardware on their end and they can keep
6548300	6553460	running all the new games you never have to buy a new console again well tilt the resolution it's
6553460	6557940	really better it's very interesting this is a very interesting direction having the consoles
6557940	6562420	directly built into the TVs essentially I mean I realize these are kind of different still kind of
6562420	6567300	growing things but how long before Microsoft puts out their own TV with a built-in Xbox and connect
6567300	6572020	is right in the top of the TV on these two little cameras well even on top of I could see that in
6572020	6577700	the next three years all the console manufacturers go you know streaming then you don't need to buy
6577700	6581580	the console you can play you can play Twisted Metal and then you can play Fable you can play
6581580	6589780	you know resistance and dead central I mean it's all on one thing could be very interesting and
6589780	6594660	then well I think they've already said that the major developers at least Sony I don't know if
6594660	6599580	they've said got a quote from Microsoft but are committed to still doing like a disk based or
6599580	6605540	physical media based format just because you know especially with 250 gigabyte caps still in most
6605540	6613140	homes like there's no way to you know download entire games you know and all that is still kind
6613140	6619780	of a ways away before these huge epic you know games that fill a blu-ray we really download
6619780	6625460	right into our homes all the time you know what I mean so I think the next generation of games
6625460	6630340	still gonna have a physical base format but you know two generations from now this is what we
6630340	6634260	could be looking at I think a lot of people thought we would be a download only at this
6634260	6643220	point but as far as Gaikai and on live are concerned I guess we are so would this would
6643220	6647380	this would this be a feature that would interest you in a TV at all guys or is this just and
6647380	6655460	whatever it's more and whatever for me I mean it's a neat it's neat technology for sure Alan
6656900	6661780	you might be in the market for a new TV soon is this something we should look to get yeah yeah
6662900	6670340	all right well moving on something that may be built in that you don't want so much I don't know
6670340	6676580	we'll see but Mass Effect 3 of course is coming out on PC as well as the various consoles but
6676580	6684980	Mass Effect 3 on the PC it will require origin it will not work on Steam as you know EA and
6684980	6690340	valve are in a little bit of a quarrel right now Alan you look like you're dying to comment
6690340	6696180	on that situation yeah they're having a wang contest they're yeah get out the ruler boys
6696180	6704260	what does it all boil down to the fact that EA is not only are they a publisher and developer
6704260	6710500	like valve is but they are also a medium of commerce distribution so now we have two storefronts
6710500	6716820	like I don't know target and Walmart or Macy's and pennies that offer the same thing and then
6716820	6721940	they're just having a cockfight over well here's distribution here's how EA puts it in their press
6721940	6727380	release quote during initial release Mass Effect 3 will be available on origin and a number of
6727380	6732500	other third-party digital retailers but not on Steam at this time Steam has adopted a set of
6732500	6736820	restrictive terms of service which limit how developers interact with customers to deliver
6736820	6741780	patches and other downloadable content we are intent on providing Mass Effect to players with
6741780	6745700	the best possible experience no matter where they purchase or play their game and are happy to
6745700	6749620	partner with any download service that does not restrict our ability to connect directly with our
6749620	6754740	consumers and I believe it's the whole fact that when you have a game on Steam patches come through
6754740	6761060	Steam and EA doesn't want that also this happened Dragon Age 2 which I mentioned during my gaming
6761060	6766020	week that I'm playing I had to install origins to get da2 digitally it was on Steam for a couple
6766020	6771220	months this was a big story like last year and it was on Steam and they took it down because valve
6771220	6777460	and Steam had a problem with how EA handled the DLC basically what it means is if you buy a game
6777460	6782900	on Steam valve wants you to be able to buy DLC for it through through the game itself like you
6782900	6789940	load the game and then through the game interface you can buy DLC or buy the DLC a la carte via
6789940	6798180	Steam with Dragon Age 2 you had to go to EA's website so valve wasn't doing the transaction
6798180	6803540	like you weren't actually doing the credit card transaction through valve or through Steam and
6803540	6808740	they didn't like that so that's what got da2 kicked off of Steam so now EA is basically
6808740	6812740	saying we are making the game and we have a store so you have to buy it through our store
6812740	6816820	well now they are swearing up and down but even if you don't buy it in the origin store you have
6816820	6820900	to install origin that's that's another big thing that's what half-life 2 did that's true that's
6820900	6826180	true but here you go now they are saying they're swearing origins not spyware quote origin is not
6826180	6831780	spyware and does not use or install spyware on users machines in order to allow origin to install
6831780	6837220	games and their patches for everyone to use origin implements a permission change that results in
6837220	6842580	windows not origin reviewing the file names in the program data origin folder this is an ordinary
6842580	6847300	windows function not an information gathering process so basically they're trying to say we
6847300	6852500	swear we're not spying on you we just want to get our store on your computer now to be fair
6852500	6857060	as alan mentioned this is what valve did several years ago and it pissed people off then to
6857060	6861140	activate your cd key and your license for half-life 2 the biggest sequel of the year at
6861140	6866580	the time in 2004 you had to install this bullshitty steam store what the fuck is this i just want to
6866580	6872500	play half-life 2 and um of course the servers were overwhelmed at the time because it was
6872500	6877140	unprecedented but yeah now i hope i'm saying this uh name right in our chat room but it's aham kara
6877140	6882740	and our term says steam is better and i have more games there already so they win end of story origin
6882740	6886980	can suck it and i think that's the way a lot of people kind of feel right now is that it's like
6886980	6892260	i don't want another store i this is very similar to what loki was talking about probably an hour
6892260	6896740	ago with the whole uh movie stuff right at the top of the show with that whole like fact that warner
6896740	6901780	brothers wants to force people to use ultraviolet and i'm like people don't want that they don't
6901780	6908900	want one store focused on one company and it's it just the consumer is gonna lose in this because
6908900	6912100	there's gonna be all these different stores it's like i don't want all these now here's the thing
6912100	6920340	though is people they think that people are either gonna buy it at retail or wait 56 days to watch it
6920340	6925940	they're not gonna like want to rent it or they're gonna stream it via their service or they'll
6925940	6933060	pirate or they'll pirate it that they will pirate it that's what's gonna happen i mean and for those
6933060	6938100	wondering if they have mass effect one and two digital delectations which were available and
6938100	6942900	is still available via steam if they can import your save games because the plot is continuous
6942900	6946500	through the third because it's a trilogy the whole story is going to wrap up with mass effect 3
6946500	6952020	yes of course if you have the previous two games even through steam it will sniff your save game
6952020	6956260	file and mass effect 3 will continue with the choices your character has made your version of
6956260	6963060	shepherd so again and if you know if ea doesn't want steam to sell it then it's it's not you know
6963060	6966980	there it's not going to be on steam if you really if this origin thing pisses you off
6968020	6973460	even if you go to best buy and buy a hard box copy of it at a store real store it's going to
6973460	6979380	put origin on your system there's no way to get around this unless you go to a crack site but to
6979380	6986020	be fair exactly what half-life 2 did yeah six or seven years ago yeah so but there were also cracked
6986020	6992580	versions of half-life 2 that's true yeah that's what's going to happen here yeah so all these
6992580	6997700	companies think they know what gamers want gamers want to be left the fuck alone that's what a lot
6997700	7003460	of gamers want anyhow all right we're going to take a moment to uh you know we say it's the show
7003460	7007380	where every gamer has a voice and one way we interact with you guys is through our email bag

7085540	7090580	huge um there's a right wing you know people within the girl scouts that have a huge problem

7118500	7124580	it's you know it's it's access to you know different different types of people um so here's
7124580	7130340	the email after all that backstory uh dear persone after reading dark secura's tumblr post about the
7130340	7135860	girl scout boy girl scout cookie boycott i did what i usually do in response to these kinds to
7135860	7140900	these kind of right wing protests i sought out a way to do the exact opposite of what those i
7140900	7146740	completely disagree with tell me not to do being antisocial and not having nieces who are currently
7146740	7152340	girl scouts i searched to see if i could buy scroll girl scout cookies online however i was
7152340	7158020	not able to find any in fact according to the link at the end of this email girl scouts of america
7158020	7163300	does not allow their cookies to be sold online my question is why there are a great number of
7163300	7168100	shut-ins that are yearning for the kind of awesome samoan goodness that are not possible that they
7168100	7174340	cannot possibly get on any samoan porn site these people have loads of excess income that can be
7174340	7179540	easily spent on fundraisers that fund the instilling freedom and independence into the mind
7179540	7184180	of young girls across this great land without programs such as the ones done by the girl scouts
7184180	7189540	of america more women may become shut-ins like the men that could the men that could potentially
7189540	7197220	fund the gsa i urge everyone to i urge everyone to urge the girl scouts of america to allow the
7197220	7201940	sale of girl scout cookies online i don't know how to do that for i am too busy playing skyrim
7201940	7208740	stay black uh redertainment um here's the thing i think the reason why they don't want you to buy
7208740	7213380	them online is keep in mind that you know the whole stuff they're trying to teach in the girl
7213380	7218420	scouts i think is part of the whole like going out and you know they want the girls to be able to you
7218420	7223060	know get out in the community and sell them and i think you know even though you make the case i
7223060	7228180	don't want to leave my house the problem is they want the girl scouts to leave the house to do it
7228180	7234180	it's to teach the the scouts customer service and how to count money and how to run a budget and
7234180	7239300	blah blah blah exactly so for that i mean you don't have the girls in a factory doing all this
7239300	7242340	i mean maybe i don't know but you know they're not going to learn as much from that i think it's
7242340	7246180	about being out there in the community being visible that's why they're out in the grocery
7246180	7250340	stores and things like that because you know redertainment at some point you're gonna have
7250340	7254580	to get out of the house and go get groceries i mean well then again and they're usually parked
7254580	7259060	out at Safeway well now like amazon and some Safeway and some shit will deliver the groceries
7259060	7263540	to you so maybe not i don't know but there's gonna come a point in your life where even that's not
7263540	7270020	gonna work it's gonna be like i need to get something i ran out of you know and the delivery
7270020	7274260	service isn't working and you will run into a little girl scout who will be smiling and if
7274260	7279940	would you like to buy a girl scout cookie if they open up online ordering oh god damn case oh god
7279940	7287460	damn case oh god because they only make a certain amount a year because you know they give the boxes
7287460	7293220	to whatever the chapters are in each state they go out to the little suburbs they would have to
7293220	7296900	make a shitload more cookies and they would have to do fulfillment and how to ship it and pricing
7296900	7300820	and blah blah blah so it's it's really just about the scouts going out into the community and
7300820	7305140	selling cookies and that's i don't think that's going to change but it'd be nice but if they
7305140	7310900	sold them online there'd be no point in setting up the little tables and irritating you you know so
7310900	7317700	i mean but to be irritating you when i always buy the girl scout cookies because like you know when
7317700	7321300	i you know for me usually it's kind of like you know i'll be walking in stores and girl scouts
7321300	7325460	are here and like would you like to buy girl scout cookies i'm like fucking yeah yeah i'll
7325460	7331700	have one yeah one girl scout cookies thank you for being here oh my god i miss samoa's so much
7331700	7338180	or whatever they're called now so thin mints all the way and the peanut butter ones get out all
7338180	7345140	right that email had nothing to do with video games well i guess sometimes people eat girl
7345140	7351700	scout cookies while playing video games so there you go yeah all right hi folks i listen sorry i
7351700	7357220	gotta read this comment from our chat chat orange laundry dot com uh sj100 matt says so it will be
7357220	7363060	like ever quest and we can type slash girl scout cookies just like yeah can you still do that and
7363060	7367220	ever ever quest went free or ever quest to win they had the pizza head of the round table plug-in
7367220	7371860	yeah slash pizza oh god that was like a running gag on olr for a year it was the whole slash pizza
7371860	7377140	thing i wonder if they still do that because you know i've requested free to play and all that yeah
7377140	7384580	it's awesome hi folks i listened to last night's show today enjoyed it as always i have to chip in
7384580	7390340	on this hope of discussion i think this blackout day has to happen most people who are not plugged
7390340	7395540	into the geek community have no concept of what it is or what it means what's worse is because the
7395540	7401700	media wants wants it in the news what's worse is because the media wants it in the news networks
7401700	7407220	are not bringing it to the forefront i wouldn't wait until the 23rd but do it on the 20th to allow
7407220	7413300	for the desired backlash against the bill to build this would also be too big of a story for the major
7413300	7420340	news outlets to ignore what gets me the most is the congressman pushing it it is extremely dismissive
7420340	7425940	of the critics including internet and security experts including vincent surf it seems he doesn't
7425940	7430820	care because the big media filling his coffers wants it and the heck with representing his
7430820	7435700	constituents or observing the constitution think about that next time you're at the ballot box
7437460	7441300	all very good points obviously there's been a lot of changes with SOPA just like over the weekend and
7441300	7446100	um it's coming up on our show a little later so um if you haven't already heard i'll kind of clarify
7446100	7452020	some of the developments with SOPA long story short it sounds like we're being heard and that's
7452020	7457540	a great thing all the way at the top we're being heard well so president obama put out a statement
7457540	7463220	about it right yes which we'll cover a little later wink wink oh but you know he's been known
7463220	7468340	to say one thing and then all of a sudden yeah yeah so but i mean yeah so it's it's kind of one
7468340	7473940	of those we've won the battle but not won the war type of thing because you know then the MPAA put
7473940	7478900	out this whole thing about you know well it's all these thieves are just trying to win and da da da
7478900	7484340	da and it's kind of like take a chill pill the movie industry has been suffering not because
7484340	7489380	of piracy but because the movies have been bad and that was uh take care signed wendy that was
7489380	7495300	from wendy or the fact that you know what when it costs 51 dollars for three people to go see a
7495300	7503700	movie that they could have rented at blockbuster for 250 you know it's like there's the problem
7503700	7509380	hollywood get your head out of your butt anyhow we'll talk a little more about those SOPA updates

7675700	7681060	really tired f you to the fact that i can't stay up as late anymore it seems like like i used to
7681060	7685540	like like i used to be able to easy stay up for rocky horror and be up till 3 34 in the morning
7685540	7690820	but now i get fucking tired at like 12 31 is because i'm old i think that's it fuck and

7717620	7722900	when we started this show we were ranting about getting into our mid-20s now it's our mid-30s
7724180	7731140	wah all right uh let's move on with some gaming news loki all right um let's talk a little bit
7731140	7737300	about uh a witch hunt that was going on it's actually kind of funny because it was regarding
7737300	7743940	uh witcher 2 and people pirating the game i remember back uh was a few months ago or so
7743940	7750180	when uh cd projects said that they're going to be uh targeting pirates and they're going to be
7750180	7758100	filing legal action against them and um you know eventually they penned an open letter to the gaming
7758100	7765380	community where they you know said they're going to stop doing that and um you know apparently
7765380	7772980	though there's no still saying you know piracy hurts them but uh you know i don't know i don't
7772980	7780660	know why they stopped i'm guessing that they had less of you know uh good luck than uh they had
7780660	7785620	hoped finding the people that stole the stuff from them i would say it's either bad pr or realized it
7785620	7789620	was going to cost them too much money you know probably just one of those when they kind of
7789620	7794100	really thought about what they were doing they realized it wasn't cost effective or something
7794100	7798900	you know i guess i'm kind of surprised they don't pursue one or two to make an example
7799460	7806980	but i don't know maybe or maybe maybe just crazy thought here maybe it has something to do with
7806980	7812100	they watched the whole internet backlash for go daddy i think a lot of people watched what
7812100	7817220	happened with that whole thing where go daddy really got pressured by their customer to change
7817220	7822740	their stance on soba and you know obviously they were wrong on soba and they should have
7822740	7828500	turned around but i mean it was really money talks in that case and i bet a lot of tech companies are
7828500	7833620	looking at that going dude don't piss off the internet i mean after all it's they're they're
7833620	7838100	the ones giving us money uh here's the actual reason why they stopped it says all right um
7838100	7843380	basically it says our fans have always remained have been remain our great greatest concern and
7843380	7848020	we pride ourselves on the fact that you all know that we listen to you and take your opinions to
7848020	7852980	heart while we are confident that no one who legally owns one of our games has been required
7852980	7858100	to compensate us for copyright infringement we value our fans our supporters and our community
7858100	7864260	too highly to take the chance that we might even falsely accuse even one individual so apparently
7864260	7870260	there's foolproof way of change of heart well you know and in a way you know what if the whole
7870260	7874980	thing went to trial and so forth and then it doesn't go their way i mean maybe they're really
7874980	7881460	afraid of that so i mean that could be part of it too so yeah all right anyhow uh moving on to
7882900	7887620	video games saving lives you know we've unfortunately had a report a lot of times on
7887620	7892900	the show about you know dumbass murders their friend over an xbox game but very rarely do you
7892900	7898020	hear the stories about how video games save people's lives and you'll never guess what game
7898020	7903620	was credited with saving a life i know this is this is a stretch but it's making the rounds and
7903620	7910100	we should talk about it words with friends is a very popular ios it's fucking scrabble like i know
7910100	7914340	they they're not allowed to say it's scrabble it's great but it's fucking scrabble okay words of
7914340	7919140	friends is fucking scrabble on the iphone it's words with friends is like bull cart
7921220	7925620	and scrabble is like mario kart although they actually remember to change
7926260	7931780	moo moo farm on the banner like they would change the board and words of friends but anyway
7931780	7936740	one of the deal about words with friends is that you could uh actually chat you can chat with
7936740	7940500	people that you're playing with and i actually have friends that will play i don't like words
7940500	7945140	with friends personally i just i you know why i don't like words with friends because it's too
7945140	7950420	easy to cheat it is way too easy because it's not a live game and i've been tempted to do this just
7950420	7954900	go to go on google and find an anagram finder go on anagram.net or whatever it is and it's even
7954900	7960100	easier than that and yeah seriously now they have apps where you take a screen print of your words
7960100	7963940	with friends and then you run it through the app and it tells you here's the best play i mean it's
7963940	7970900	like now i could play with people that i know wouldn't cheat but like i just if i have the
7970900	7976100	alerts on my fucking phone goes off at 2 30 in the morning with some of my you know some of my
7976100	7979140	friends stay up later they're on different coasts or whatever so one of my friends on the east coast
7979140	7983220	will just be getting up for the day at 6 a.m and makes their work makes their play in words with
7983220	7989940	friends and here i am fast asleep at 3 a.m that wakes me up more than it wakes you up i know
7989940	7995780	right so words of friends can be very dangerous in that regard so if i play with alerts off though
7995780	7999940	then i after about a week i'm like ah fuck it and then yeah i've already forgotten i think i have
7999940	8006420	some like three moves i have to do right now and i just i yeah well anyway i've been dragging this
8006420	8011140	out but long story short there was a random match played in word with friends with these you know
8011140	8016100	two folks one of them was uh an australian and one of them was here in missouri and they just
8016100	8020500	got randomly matched up but they were chatting with each other and i guess having a very nice
8020500	8026900	conversation which is almost newsworthy in itself like asl everybody i chat with on the internet
8026900	8032340	that's usually a stranger is usually a dumbass like no offense you guys i'm talking about the
8032340	8038500	strangers like if i play random online games with strangers like uno or something like i get the
8038500	8045060	biggest dumb fucks on the internet you know so i it's a miracle in one that civil people got
8045060	8051780	together to play this game uh and then apparently uh this guy in australia simon fletcher was
8051780	8056740	playing words with friends and he started complaining in the chat i've been having
8056740	8061300	chest pains and whatever like i don't know like how does that even fucking come up in chat like
8062660	8070420	you just played the word heartburn for 45 points sorry i'm replying so low i i'm i'm typing with
8070420	8075300	one hand because my arm is having shooting i can't use my right arm right now because i'm
8075300	8079220	having shooting pain so how does that even come up in a random chat i don't know whatever but
8079220	8086180	they've been talking about it and beth legler was the opponent uh and uh they were playing against
8086180	8091780	beth i guess simon his wife were playing against beth and beth luckily was married to a doctor
8092340	8096100	so kind of told the you know her husband about oh well this i've been playing with this guy
8096100	8102020	in australia but he's telling me and the guy the doctor said you know what simon needs to
8102020	8107780	go to a hospital immediately and sure enough when he finally went to the hospital he had a 99
8107780	8113860	blockage near his heart so it was right to tell the guy to go to a hospital now i get with this
8113860	8118180	whole like video game saving lives thing or whatever i think that part of it's obviously
8118180	8121940	getting blown out of proportion just like low he was rolling his eyes at the beginning of the story
8121940	8126900	this was more about guys being fucking stubborn when it comes to going to the doctor
8128420	8133060	it's really what let's be real how many of you are in a lot of you probably are guys
8133060	8136820	those few ladies that are out there listening i know there's a few of you how many of you know
8136820	8139620	guys that are too stubborn to go to the doctor because they don't want to admit something's
8139620	8142980	wrong with them or they don't want to admit they're getting old or you know whatever it is
8144100	8150180	i think this is more a fact that honey a doctor is telling me you need to go to the hospital
8150180	8158020	you're gonna go to the fucking hospital i know someone whose dad had a minor incident and it
8158020	8162260	turned out to be serious but he also hadn't set foot in a doctor's office in almost 30 years
8163860	8170580	that's crazy so it's like and his attitude was you don't see doctors because nothing exists until
8170580	8174180	they find it and that's when you're sick so if you don't go to the doctor they won't find you
8174180	8179060	you're in for i mean i realize some people avoid the doctor due to well not having insurance you
8179060	8183460	know that's a whole nother oprah i'm not going to get into or they avoid the doctor maybe because
8183460	8189460	of religious reasons i guess but for real if neither of those apply to you and you're just
8189460	8202100	being fucking stubborn like go don't you want to be healthy all right anyhow so yay words with
8202100	8209380	friends bringing people together this is the same this could have been about a 1997 aol chat room
8209380	8217460	you know what i mean whatever all right moving on alan so ces just happened and usually that's a big
8218180	8225460	electronics and hardware gadgetry uh uh event not so much for the gaming that's mostly saved
8225460	8230340	of course for tokyo game show and e3 and all that however the biggest gaming related thing
8230340	8237220	that came out of ces most likely is the project fiona gaming touchscreen tablet by a company
8237220	8243300	called razor the e r a zer and i must admit looking at the pictures of this thing it looks
8243300	8253060	like a very uh sexy device it looks well made it's sleek and um it's gonna run an intel ivy
8253060	8262420	bridge core i7 processor it's going to have three axis tilt gyro functionality a magnet magnetometer
8262420	8268340	accelerometer force feedback is going to vibrate dolby 7 surround sound with built-in wi-fi
8268340	8275620	and bluetooth and razor ceo min liang tan explains we are looking to change the whole perception of
8275620	8281140	tablets this first of its kind pc gaming tablet with integrated dual controllers is definitely
8281140	8286980	not for playing casual games about unhappy birds or zombie killing flora throwing shade
8287620	8294180	throwing shade at the iphone games yeah imagine a black ipad that's a little bit thicker and it has
8294180	8299700	two um i don't want to say they look like wiimotes but they're they're bars that you
8299700	8303860	hold in your hand like two playstation move navigation yeah just with that without the
8303860	8308820	the glowy ball at the end yeah they're playstation controllers like the nunchuck of the move yeah
8308820	8315700	um and again if i didn't mention this earlier it just it it's a portable pc it's it's not it's not
8315700	8320820	its own proprietary platform like a playstation or 360 it's just it's for pc games you would install
8320820	8328100	pc games on this and the price point is there say they want it to be below a thousand us but again
8328100	8335860	there'll be 999.99 and this thing looks awesome and it's like all right it's pc gaming on a
8335860	8339460	tablet and it's a touchscreen it's got all this cool shit but where's the market because if you
8339460	8343860	have that kind of money to drop on something like this you can get a comp like a very competent
8344420	8350820	gaming laptop that is a fucking laptop and you can do laptop shit on it that laptop you're using
8350820	8359140	right now i bought for 400 well over two years ago because i was with my ex at the time and so it was
8359140	8363540	like probably about three years old and that cost me 400 that will run warcraft cataclysm on it
8363540	8370020	yeah not low low settings but you can you can play on it yeah so i mean imagine what a thousand
8370020	8376660	dollars now would get you you know and so the the display on it is 10.1 inches a diagonal viewable
8376660	8384100	uh resolution is 1280 by 800 i'm gonna post a link of this into chat it looks like an awesome device
8384100	8388980	it's great that they're trying to make this but where where's the market who's who's who is this
8388980	8393620	for i have to agree with this point that cinderwolf said in our chat room at chat orange laundry.com
8393620	8401300	cinderwolf says did he just say 7.1 surround sound on a tablet like yeah they may be going
8401300	8406660	or they may be going too far like maybe they don't really need that it's like and if you have a 7.1
8406660	8412260	surround sound set up and it broadcasts the bluetooth via bluetooth to your fucking speakers
8412260	8418580	then you're in your house and you have a computer play your games on that unless you've got you're
8418580	8422900	like on amtrak you've got these backpacks like oh these are my speakers yo and you're setting
8422900	8427860	them up i don't know you have like uber headphones that can emulate it really fucking well you know
8428420	8433540	it might be a bit much yeah so the dolby 7.1 chip and firmware is in there at least but yeah exactly
8433540	8438260	if you've got the speakers then you're probably in your house you can play on your desktop so
8438260	8442820	yeah i'm gonna it it looks like a hot little device but mom is always on the desktop playing
8442820	8447940	words with friends with people in australia so maybe that's why i need a tablet it also sounds
8447940	8453540	like because this tablet is so streamlined that it's going to be able to churn out max
8454580	8459940	settings graphics on this little tablet that a pc where you you always have to upgrade your graphics
8459940	8463940	card every two years and it sounds like this is just a total monster visually on how it's
8463940	8468740	going to render games but who's going to buy it loki is this something that interests you
8468740	8478900	fuck no why not too damn expensive now i was trying to find out um they have um this this
8478900	8485060	seriously makes me think like i'm surprised loki doesn't try to build his own version of this for
8485060	8491780	half as much no no it it's don't get me wrong the what what's in it is pretty powerful it's got a
8491780	8498420	core i7 inside of it and a bunch of other you know fancy shit and in the form factor is nice but it
8498420	8504020	looks ridiculous i mean it's not portable at all it's as portable as a laptop is and honestly just
8504020	8509300	buy a fucking laptop and a controller i mean it it's pretty much and the price point is just
8509300	8513620	ridiculous i was trying to find they remember they had this is the company that wanted to do
8513620	8520020	that switchblade which was the m portable mo you know system that was going to revolutionize
8520020	8524900	everything and then that kind of flopped and then they came out with this really fucking expensive
8524900	8531060	um keyboard which i cannot find for life me but i swear that keyboard's like 300 bucks
8531620	8538020	all i have to say though is that you know we're mere probably within a month of the next ipad
8538020	8543060	announcement right that should come late january february if by some i mean we all know the next
8543060	8547700	ipad has to fucking be high def has to right and the rumors are swelling and all that stuff it's
8547700	8554100	going to be more powerful if apple finally decides maybe now is the time to finally put
8554100	8559780	some type of attachment on the ipad that gives tangible game controls this thing should not even
8559780	8565780	bother coming out it's fucking dead already like like not to sound all apple fanboy but let's be
8565780	8573060	real and with the tablet and the two you know move like sony move like gaming sticks i am interested
8573060	8578260	in how those gaming sticks with the thumb you know thing translates mouse controls but what if
8578260	8583460	you want to play a first person shooter you need the wasd and the keyboard and stuff so even then
8583460	8589700	even now this tablet looks like it's gonna limit the experience of the pc games that a laptop or
8589700	8599060	pc would give you so it's also 100 or it's also like a thousand dollars yeah i mean you can spend
8599060	8605300	a thousand dollars on a laptop and get a nice laptop yeah all right well let's move on with
8605300	8610100	a couple more news stories for you guys and then the twitter topics and the skype line at 1 877
8610100	8614500	game olr loki and also by the time it actually does come out there's going to be something
8614500	8620980	better and cheaper i mean fuck there switchblade never came out that was shown in e3 i think last
8620980	8626500	year or ces or some shit okay sorry um anyway so let's talk a little bit about successful
8626500	8633220	franchises in one successful franchise which i'm just surprised every day and how successful it is
8633220	8641700	just dance and just dance 3 sold 7 million um copies already worldwide and that's from october
8641700	8649700	and of course um you know the series itself is moved 25 million units um i would definitely
8649700	8657300	say that the music franchise is not dead or at least just dances and dead so konami ddr
8657300	8663140	when have you moved 25 million units ever can i ask how 7 million units ever how does just dance
8663140	8669300	3 compared to dance central 2 it's a different type of game dance central 2 is more of learning
8669300	8674420	the actual like dance steps whereas just dance the whole just dance series is more mimicking you
8674420	8679300	remember when you watched me play that abba game oh yeah we're laughing where you're holding the
8679300	8684180	thing yeah that's imagine that to katy perry songs that's just dance i mean i what i meant
8684180	8691940	what i meant was the uh this the units sold the sales oh yeah they're far and beyond dance central
8691940	8695860	2 well yeah because dance central 2 is connect and everyone of course has a fucking wii so that
8695860	8701460	makes sense yeah but i i want to say that i would be willing to bet that just dance 3 on the connect
8701460	8708100	is probably outsold dance central 2 which i don't know i i i haven't played just dance 3
8708100	8714980	specifically but dance central 2 is so good like it's kind of sad um i had to look up the numbers
8714980	8720180	but yeah i'd be willing to bet that they they've probably beat them out all right well while you
8720180	8724980	look that up don't interrupt me wait till i'm done with the story but uh i want to close out today
8724980	8730180	before we get to the skype line with some more of those um updates on soap up obviously the stop
8730180	8735940	online piracy act there has been and since that email was sent in and since last week's show there
8735940	8743940	has been quite a bit of change going on with this and uh for one the um SOPA sponsor lamar smith
8743940	8749940	came out uh and said he's going to pull the dns blocking provisions from the bill quote after the
8749940	8754900	consultation with industry groups across the country i feel we should remove domain name
8754900	8759300	system blocking from the stop online piracy act so that the committee can further examine the
8759300	8763060	issues surrounding this provision so you know that was obviously one of the big controversial
8763060	8768180	things is the whole blocking of websites that getting taken out of the bill now also over the
8768180	8771700	weekend the obama administration is pretty much has already been brought up earlier in the show
8771700	8776660	but i had it listed here so whatever uh the obama administration basically came out against the
8776660	8782260	bills in their current form saying in a nutshell i'd i you know i'm gonna really try my best to
8782260	8788660	summarize this they support that foreign websites and piracy and all this needs to be stopped
8788660	8796500	but not at the cost of censoring lawful activity and must not as they say in the release inhibit
8796500	8800980	innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small so in other words they don't want to see
8801860	8807700	sites get shut down by corporations because of you know flaw wording in this bill which is kind
8807700	8812500	of where i think a lot of us are at you know i i can see that they need to do something about
8812500	8817380	foreign website need to do something about fucking spam you know what i mean that shit is annoying
8817380	8820740	but how do you stop it and i don't know if there's an easy answer i really don't think there's an
8820740	8827220	easy answer to stopping that kind of stuff good filters on your email i this might sound a little
8827220	8834420	weird yes good filters on your email but maybe we need like a new email 2.0 like maybe they need to
8834420	8838580	upgrade the standards they use for emails that gives more accountability to the computers that
8838580	8843780	send them maybe i i that's just kind of where i'm at like you know you can kind of spoof a lot of
8843780	8848580	that now but maybe they need to change the system that uses encryption verification i don't i mean
8848580	8852900	i guess any of that could get hacked by people but there's got to be something where there's
8852900	8856900	more accountability from the original center and it's easier to track you know what i mean
8856900	8865460	um okay so just dance and dance central 2 now dance central 2 has been out a lot less time well
8865460	8870500	a few weeks less they've it's only been out 11 weeks whereas dance or just dance 3 has been out
8870500	8881380	for 14 weeks just dance 3 is at 993 191 units um that's only in the us and dance central 2 is at
8881380	8889060	930 858 units so they're slightly ahead but they've been out for three more weeks interesting
8889060	8894340	okay well that's good to know although for me note this chart which was from last week
8894340	8901220	uh dance central 2 is in the 17th spot whereas just dance 3 is in the 20th spot well that's good
8901860	8905700	yeah well i mean again i mean i'm not i'm not hating on just dance 3 i mean it's a decent game
8905700	8910740	but that's just that's straight on the 360 that's not all platforms okay all right let's uh let's
8910740	8914020	open up the skype line it's that time we're going to open up the skype line now and take your calls
8914020	8920020	at one eight seven seven game olr or as our username on skype is orange lounge radio all one
8920020	8924100	word while we wait for those calls to come in because there is a little bit of a delay we have
8924100	8928340	just a couple tweets tonight not a lot but um we do have a couple so let me get to some of those
8928340	8933140	tweets right now i just want to make sure there wasn't anything earlier in the week that i missed
8933140	8939860	here uh i guess not anything i'm catching off top my head i apologize i'm gonna be honest if you
8939860	8943620	tweet us on sunday you have a much better chance of getting read than tweeting us on monday after
8943620	8948100	the show because sometimes i lose those amongst there's we get a lot of spam tweets too i have to
8948100	8954500	filter through anyway uh we'll start with a tweet from spazzinator on twitter tweets us and says
8954500	8961380	will there be another marathon or fuck show anytime soon um fuck show no that was a that
8961380	8967220	was a one-time thing that's done um a marathon show yes we've been talking about it we just
8967220	8970580	don't know when tonight would have been a great night for that but just too much other stuff
8970580	8976260	going on so it may not be until there's another long weekend which for me is a long weekend which
8976260	8980820	for me isn't until memorial day do you get president's day off nope interesting see i
8980820	8984020	don't get president's day off but i do get martin luther king day off i don't we don't get any of
8984020	8989220	those interesting but you get memorial day right yes oh but we have we have other plans memorial
8989220	8996020	day weekend most likely so sometime it is it is in our minds let me put it that way it's just
8996020	8999700	you know again that whole thing i talked about earlier about only being able to stay up so late
8999700	9003220	but i think it would be fun to do another like noon to midnight show if nothing else
9003220	9011540	um so we'll see it's it's on our minds but just not in the next month or two all right uh let's
9011540	9016580	see moving on to some other tweets uh tiger claw sends us a couple tweets i'll start with this one
9016580	9023060	about the writer's guild uh announces a list of nominees for best writing in video games you know
9023060	9028660	the wga they um also nominate movies and things like that but now they get into writing for video
9028660	9033860	games after all a lot of video games are very movie-sized scripts these days right so um these
9033860	9042100	games got nominated for best video game writing by the wga uh assassins creed revelations batman
9042100	9050500	arkham city brink mortal combat strange but i guess it did have a story mode uh and uncharted
9050500	9057460	three drake's deception uh those are the nominees from the wga um list needs more portal 2 in my
9057460	9063300	opinion that's kind of a odd obviously missing game but uh yeah i mean still a lot of those
9063300	9069380	games are very good and have very you know stories that suck you in so there you go again our skype
9069380	9074980	line 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio if you'd like to go ahead
9074980	9082660	and give us a call you can at any time all right one of the story from tiger claw whistleblower
9082660	9090020	alleges unlawful practices at code masters hmm uh he links us to the story on shack news
9090020	9094260	a former code masters employee has publicly accused the publisher of unlawful business
9094260	9100260	practices uh a programmer semi assessy i hope i said that right oh was a programmer on the
9100260	9106180	game body count says that code masters uh has threatened former staff with bankruptcy
9106180	9111460	proceedings over a dispute regarding wages the company claims were mistakenly paid out
9111460	9116020	uh he wrote this whole blog post about it saying that code masters frequently infringed on
9116020	9121220	employees rights uh he had to work a left or he had to they failed to give workers 11 hours of
9121220	9126740	rest in any 24-hour work period so in other words yet another slave driving game company story
9126740	9131780	unfortunately here way too many of these on the show which is really sad but anyway we got a call
9131780	9135460	coming in on the skype line so let's go to it hi you are on orange launch radio who's this
9136020	9140340	this is vid power hey vid power i haven't heard from you in a very long time how are you doing
9140340	9145940	good good how what's up with you guys um you know same old shit different week 10 years later
9146500	9152740	right right exactly so yeah i wanted i wanted to call in and talk about ces ces over that's right
9152740	9157380	you're in vegas right are you still there indeed so exactly in your backyard did you go to the party
9158500	9165380	uh yes i did i did go to ces and i checked out the uh the video games there and i kind of wanted to
9165380	9171300	uh tell you guys what what stuff is good there our man on the street please how was ces what
9171300	9175620	just what did you see it was pretty good it's pretty good you know what the the the one game
9175620	9182340	that uh really uh kind of came out to me and i wasn't expecting to like was uh believe it or not
9182340	9189700	it was microsoft flight oh yeah the the upcoming flight simulator yeah that's like their replacement
9189700	9194020	for microsoft flight simulator right is their new their new version of that for a new generation
9194020	9198820	exactly exactly you know i i've only played like a flight simulator like once or twice in my life
9198820	9205620	and i was like really awful so um you know this game wasn't really on my radar but uh after
9205620	9212020	playing it and um it was really fun i gotta i gotta admit was it easy to pick up because i know
9212020	9215780	the problem with a lot of flight simulators is that i don't know how to fly a fucking plane and
9215780	9221300	like it is a flight simulator and if you don't know the proper sequence to turn the plane on
9221300	9225860	to get it to take off like you're not going anywhere in that game like or does does microsoft
9225860	9233140	flight kind of simplify that yeah yes so what they did was they had a setup um on a pc but they had a
9233140	9240580	xbox 360 controller connected to the pc and um one of the the developers was there and basically
9241220	9248820	the he had these bunch of like challenges and it really using just like the xbox 360 controller
9248820	9255780	it was really simplified controls and it makes flying a plane way easier hmm much easier than
9255780	9262100	you know i thought it would be interesting but yeah that was it was really fun they had like
9262100	9268500	really basic stuff like you know how to take off and how to land and they had some fun stuff like
9269060	9274820	how to like collect all these like low like fly through rings and stuff things like that
9274820	9279620	oh wasn't that wasn't that one of the stages in pilot wings no no but very very good looking
9279620	9283940	graphics i assume i remember flight flight simulators were always really good demonstrators
9283940	9288020	of like graphical capabilities that was also one of the stages at superman 64 shut up
9291380	9296260	awesome well i mean how big of a presence does video gaming have at ces because we're usually
9296260	9300980	told that it's kind of it's not there as much as you'd think well yeah that's an accurate statement
9300980	9308580	it's definitely not not big in terms of video game related stuff um obviously at the microsoft booth
9309540	9315700	and at the sony booth as well those are pretty obvious but uh other than that like you couldn't
9315700	9322580	really find anything else uh that were video game related so those are like really the only two
9322580	9327380	booths that you could go to to play actual video games gotcha was there anything just you know
9327380	9331220	since we're all nerds here at olr was there anything that kind of jumped out at you like
9331220	9334420	wow this is something i really want in my living room like even if it's not necessarily gaming
9334420	9338740	related was there any device that just made you go like dang i want one of these next christmas
9341220	9347220	tell you should not really not really it was just a lot of random cool stuff that would it's
9347220	9352740	probably not ready for a consumer level until you know a few years down the line it's all too
9352740	9359620	damn expensive how does one of those 100-foot hd TVs look in person it is pretty sweet gotta admit
9361140	9368740	seeing that in person was was pretty eye-opening there awesome awesome well now is does the porn
9368740	9374020	expo still go on next door at the same time or did that change now you know what that one the
9374020	9382100	the original porn expo it now it's on like the week after cs however this completely separate
9382100	9388900	company is doing another like adult convention thing they're in the same time so you know
9388900	9395060	tapping into that market back to back adult cons in las vegas i guess i guess it can sustain we'll
9395060	9400660	see good time one of these days i gotta make it to ces that's gotta be on my like my bucket list
9400660	9405540	of things to do um at some point so because do you have to be industry to get into yes i don't think
9405540	9411380	so i thought you did really technically you do but it's pretty easy is it like the old e3 it's
9411380	9415540	really easy yeah it's pretty easy very cool very cool well vin power anything else you want to
9415540	9421940	share with us tonight uh no just um just kind of giving you guys a quick gaming summary of over at
9421940	9428900	ces i played some of the other house party games yeah um i am alive is good stuff i really enjoyed
9428900	9435300	that it's really it's really fun it's like reminds me of prince of persia okay and uh the the combat
9435300	9440420	quote unquote combat is uh remember playing uh middle gear solid games and you know you can hold
9440420	9447060	up people by pointing a gun at them the entire combat is kind of centered around like intimidating
9447060	9452180	your opponents by pointing a gun at them so that's like really original i had a lot of fun
9452180	9456580	with that interesting did you play the new alan wake at all i did i did you know i didn't play
9456580	9461940	too much of the first alan wake that played uh that was released but i got enough i played
9461940	9466900	enough of this new one too it's it's really more of the same so if you were a fan of the first
9466900	9471860	alan wake this new one is right up your alley interesting that it's downloadable but hopefully
9471860	9476580	it does really well because i like the first alan wait game but i don't i guess it didn't it was
9476580	9480900	kind of one of those games that sold gradually from what i understand like it never really was
9480900	9486500	the chart topper but it was always kind of you know it lasted for a long time so definitely
9486500	9489940	definitely all right well vin power i'm gonna let you go to get some more calls hopefully but um

9594500	9599460	you know that that travis plays a lot understation live i was actually there with jessica also from
9599460	9606260	understation live that was the year 2000 that was october 2000 because i did two trips to vegas like
9606260	9610020	almost back to back and then i haven't been back in like 10 years but uh that was the first time i
9610020	9615780	was ever drunk i was like 22 or 23 so you know but i was at the i know i i totally missed the
9615780	9622420	21 years old thing go figure but uh yeah that was at the star trek experience and um it wasn't the
9622420	9627300	first time i'd ever had alcohol it's the first time i got drunk and like a true nerd it was at
9627300	9632020	the star trek experience the borg thing wasn't even there i never got to ride it and now it's
9632020	9638420	all closed which is sad so oh did one of the kitties finally come out yeah to eat to eat

9649460	9654260	cinderwolf what's on your mind buddy i'm not too much actually just figured i finally have time to
9654260	9659140	actually catch the broadcast tonight thought i'd call in and uh you know say hi to everybody well
9659140	9665300	hello hello aren't you from canada if i remember right i am yeah you've got it well you don't have
9665300	9669700	a three-day weekend then because martin luther king's a very american holiday so you don't you
9669700	9676420	just happen to have a late sunday available huh yeah pretty much i usually get about a half a day
9676420	9681860	really three quarters of a day a week between both jobs all right all right wow wow all right so
9681860	9684980	crazy crazy what else did you got a chance to call in what do you want to talk about tonight any
9684980	9690580	story or maybe something we missed uh well actually i'm going to be very honest i did
9690580	9694180	actually miss quite a bit of the broadcast so i'll actually have to go back and catch up on it
9694180	9698740	tomorrow but uh i just really kind of talk a little bit about a game that i've been playing
9698740	9705380	recently called uh bastion actually oh yes of course bastion the canadian launches the game
9705380	9711540	yes of course pretty much yeah like i'd uh actually i just double checked my skyrim count
9711540	9716900	i've been playing skyrim for about 180 hours over the past two month and a half now and uh
9716900	9721060	actually the video card died so i borrowing a replacement from a buddy of mine can't run
9721060	9727140	skyrim but i can play bastion of it uh of all things so well bastion is you know not quite the
9727140	9734260	cutting edge 3d graphics but sometimes it is not all about the graphics right no i mean it's not
9734260	9740180	not at all in fact i find this sort of gaming revolution even though it's uh most of everything
9740180	9746020	seems to be centered around 3d and you know impressive graphics i find there's still this
9746020	9753140	growing movement to go you know old school or traditional sort of 2d with you know cell shading
9753140	9762820	or you know that sort of thing 2d side scrollers even so um what what possessed you to decide to
9762820	9770420	jump in and check out bastion um i actually picked up uh the demo online uh through the 360 back
9770420	9774820	before the uh the console update with the dashboard and uh you know it was sort of an update right in
9774820	9779540	my face i was like you know i love the artwork i'm actually a major fan of artwork uh working
9779540	9785860	actually at a comic shop as well uh and it really stood out to me i found the artwork is uh is
9785860	9791620	actually very fantastic very amazing um it's almost like somebody's like sketching the world
9791620	9796100	and it just sort of comes to life and that stood out to me at the time so i'm playing this and i'm
9796100	9800900	like wow you know the controls are very simplistic it's an incredibly basic story you don't even need
9800900	9807700	to know anything about the game to start getting into it and you know even uh two hours into the
9807700	9812500	game you're still like okay i still don't know the entire backstory so it's sort of driving you to
9812500	9818820	uh really keep playing to find out how it's going to end and you know exactly what the calamity is
9818820	9822980	now a lot of folks have kind of talked about the narration in the game and how important that you
9822980	9828820	know the whole narration uh and narrating it as it's unfolding do you think the narration is
9828820	9834660	something really unique to the game or are you kind of like ah this is gimmicky actually i i
9834660	9840420	actually love the narration it's you know once in a while it's kind of cheesy but narration actually
9840420	9845460	it really makes it feel almost kind of like you know like story time when you're a kid so to speak
9845460	9850660	but it's not enough that it's there's not so much that you're like okay this is really something
9850660	9857140	that annoys me it's a hate actually i never really thought of it that way sort of deal when it hits
9857140	9862180	when it hits a new point um and you're just like well you know i kind of like the backstory dialogue
9862180	9866580	when you're you're uh you know you smoke the little pipe you go to this little area to to
9866580	9871940	essentially just grind and grind and grab pick up your little crystal shards or fragments and uh in
9871940	9876020	between each wave there's a little piece of the kid's backstory in the background so it's like
9876020	9879780	hey that's kind of neat bringing me up to speed on who i'm actually playing with and i thought it
9879780	9884660	was kind of interesting that like as you kind of put that center area together it can kind of
9884660	9889620	change the way the narration is going to because each building that you build kind of changes you
9889620	9895380	know you get a little different narration for that so yeah actually i found the narration did
9895380	9900820	change a little bit between buildings but by the end of it you know you're like i'm i'm not
9900820	9905940	there like i'm i still have to be only about halfway through it but the i find the narration
9905940	9909620	really ends up the same because you end up building the same buildings by the end of it
9909620	9916260	anyway sure sure so it's so in a way there's a little bit of a sort of a multi-path but it's
9916260	9921540	still a very linear storyline which there's nothing wrong with linear but the way they've
9921540	9925940	gone about the story kind of makes you think well you know maybe if i played a little bit differently
9925940	9931380	later on even though i know the ending is it going to be more of a challenge or am i going to
9931380	9936420	discover things i didn't know were there before or so the game was really well developed in
9936420	9942020	dragging and sucking you into it to see you through to the end all right well it sounds
9942020	9947460	like uh you are definitely enjoying bastion so um are you hoping there's going to be a sequel
9947460	9955060	as if i need to ask definitely i i can i can hope i mean there there have been the rumors of buzz
9955060	9959620	online saying there is saying there aren't and you know we just all have to sort of cross our
9959620	9965780	fingers but i figure once i finish this i'll probably round skyrim count up to 200 hours so
9967060	9971700	all right nice all right well um cinderwolf thanks so much for the call and reminding us
9971700	9975140	that you know bastion might be one of those games you missed at the end of 2011 amongst all the
9975140	9979460	skyrim so uh definitely all right well cinderwolf you have a good one and thanks so much for calling
9979460	9985220	in youtube all right take everybody oh he cut out there at the end but we'll just hope he said
9985220	9990340	something nice all right 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange launch radio if you

10662020	10666900	my final thought is i just realized we have two posters in here that say haters to the left and
10666900	10670660	one points one way and one points the other so i'm confused which way did the haters go
10673300	10677300	because they're on opposite walls either out the front door or into the kitchen to cook for us
10677300	10680660	into the okay fair enough all right uh let's say into the oven oh my god
10682660	10688020	like like the witch like a tansel and gretel all right loki your final thought tonight uh
10688020	10695060	my final thought is uh i really don't want to eat mcdonald's anymore i'm gonna try to stop is that a
10695060	10698580	late new year's resolution is that what i'm hearing no it's been one i've been toiling
10698580	10703700	around and i was actually gonna do that i was just running a little bit late um this evening
10703700	10707620	so there wasn't really any time for me to stop anywhere else i could have heated up some soup
10707620	10713940	but i didn't have a lot of time to do that so i made this uh this cheddar and beer soup i don't
10714580	10721860	care for it too much though because it it the beer didn't cook out and so it's gotta like
10721860	10726100	you know you can if you drink the whole pot of it i guess you can get a little bit buzzed but uh
10727220	10731780	it wasn't it wasn't quite how i had pictured i put too many leaks in it too it's too sweet
10731780	10737380	sorry i'm laughing at what act deaf said in chat and i'm assuming this is about the
10737380	10745220	haters to the left sign the points to the kitchen haters gonna bake it works kinda right we're all
10745220	10752500	right sorry it's only appropriate i cut your ass off with something stupid i was done all right no
