00:00.000 --> 00:19.640
Tonight, January 15th, 2012, Kid Icarus Uprising will come with a bundled accessory.

00:19.640 --> 00:29.760
A new PC gaming tablet is shown at CES, and can Apple IOS gaming actually save your life?

00:29.760 --> 00:35.040
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.040 --> 00:38.880
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.880 --> 00:46.920
We are live with the 442nd episode of our show for this January the 15th of 2012.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.820
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you tonight with my co-host, actually, I won't

00:50.820 --> 00:54.520
be joining you with Dark Sakura tonight, sadly, Dark Sakura is off.

00:54.520 --> 00:59.320
She unexpectedly had something come up where she is in San Francisco tonight, doing some

00:59.320 --> 01:02.280
friend stuff, so she's not here.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.680
So sadly, she will not be joining us tonight, but we always like an excuse to say hello

01:07.680 --> 01:10.320
to Salacious Pop, who's filling in tonight.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.720
As always, as usual.

01:11.720 --> 01:17.640
Who's kind of become the Joan Rivers of our show, the always fill-in host when Johnny

01:17.640 --> 01:18.640
Carson was gone.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.880
That reference is way too old for any of our listeners.

01:21.880 --> 01:25.680
If I tried to hide in the office while you were recording, I'd just get knock knock knock.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.760
The show only has two people tonight, you have to help.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.960
Do you really want this show to be a complete failure?

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
Actually, no.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.400
Loki and I have done a show alone before, but it's more fun with three.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
It was fantastic.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
Three's a crowd.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.400
Oh yes, there he is, Techmaster Loki is here tonight.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.400
I'm here.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.400
How are you doing, Loki?

01:43.400 --> 01:48.680
Thankfully, Alan came to the rescue with barbecue sauce, because McDonald's, you know, if the

01:48.680 --> 01:51.880
sauces have green covers, they must be the same, right?

01:51.880 --> 01:58.000
Because habanero is just exactly the same as sweet and sour sauce.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.080
And of course, always joining us, our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, because

02:02.080 --> 02:08.320
you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, home

02:08.320 --> 02:13.200
of such shows as Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us every week, Video Game Outsiders,

02:13.200 --> 02:16.000
Dead Pixel Live, whole bunch of shows, there's a whole roster of shows.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.220
I'd name them all, but I would fill up the three hours.

02:18.220 --> 02:21.720
So check that out at allgames.com.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
Let's see.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.840
And going to our live chat room, who's always with us, Tigerclaw starts us off saying, oh,

02:26.840 --> 02:30.120
tonight's show is a sausage fest, I guess, if you want to look at it that way.

02:30.120 --> 02:34.320
But we will have chatter comments, and I know there's some lovely ladies that chat with

02:34.320 --> 02:37.760
the show, and then of course, Twitter, and hopefully phone calls later.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.160
So you know, it'll be ladies' night on the Skype line, hopefully, we'll get some women

02:41.160 --> 02:42.160
to call in.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.120
But you know what?

02:44.120 --> 02:47.880
No matter what your gender is, we're all gamers, that's what it's about here, video games,

02:47.880 --> 02:52.720
the gamer lifestyle, and the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.880
Tonight before we get into our gaming weeks, you know, we usually do a little bit of topics

02:55.880 --> 02:58.240
at the start of the show.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.880
We're up against the Golden Globes tonight.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.880
It seems like having a show on a Sunday, we're always up against some stupid award show.

03:03.880 --> 03:04.880
Oh, that's tonight?

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
I totally didn't even realize.

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
I didn't know either.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.080
Yes, the Golden Globes is tonight.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.120
I mean, honestly, guys, I mean, are you really gonna watch the show?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.200
Just read it tomorrow like everybody else.

03:13.200 --> 03:18.920
I will say this is that the whole Ricky Jervis thing where he's like a total like asshole,

03:18.920 --> 03:23.800
but like, it's funny, like, you know, he just says what everybody's thinking like that part

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
will be cool.

03:24.800 --> 03:29.080
But I know that all the good zingers will be hosting I'm assuming Oh, yeah, like remember

03:29.080 --> 03:30.080
that whole thing?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.440
Like he's not going to come back to host he's not gonna he was disrespectful and he did

03:32.440 --> 03:34.400
not represent our point of view.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.400
And it's like, oh, shit, people love it when he trolled so highest fucking ratings in like

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
10 years.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.760
Dude, seriously, if you want your show to have great ratings, just fucking get Neil

03:42.760 --> 03:44.160
Patrick Harris to host it.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.640
Okay, he can host anything.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.640
That's the Tonys.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.960
But yeah, I don't care.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.960
He can host anything.

03:48.960 --> 03:49.960
And he's awesome.

03:49.960 --> 03:50.960
Neil Patrick Harris is awesome.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.440
But anyway, thinking about movies had me thinking about the fact that I will tie this into gaming,

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
I promise.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.920
Um, over the weekend, Alan and I have a new year's resolution this year, actually, this

04:00.920 --> 04:05.440
was actual or I should say, Alan has a new year's resolution that I've been, and we use

04:05.440 --> 04:08.780
his term at work, volun told.

04:08.780 --> 04:09.780
That's where you weren't.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.360
That's where you didn't volunteer for you that volun told so I got volun told for this

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
new year's resolution.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.360
But I liked it.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.360
So I went along with it.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.360
So what is the new year's resolution?

04:16.360 --> 04:19.480
It's something I've done in 07 or 08 that worked really well.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.400
And it's to just see one movie in theaters a month, regardless of what's out.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.960
One movie a month in theaters.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
Yep.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.960
So and that's good.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.160
Because last year we saw like two movies the entire year.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.640
We saw Tangled and Black Swan and those were both done by February and we didn't see a

04:33.640 --> 04:34.640
whole other movie.

04:34.640 --> 04:38.280
I got my movie for February already, but I haven't gotten a chance.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.600
I definitely need to go see it or sneak out to see it.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.640
Wait are you doing the one movie a month thing too?

04:42.640 --> 04:44.840
No, but there's a movie in February I want to see.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.960
What is that?

04:45.960 --> 04:46.960
I don't remember what it's called.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.600
It's the one that was, no no, I can't remember what it's called.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.920
It's the one, it's basically the found footage thing, but it's like these three guys become

04:56.920 --> 05:00.460
kind of, they like get superpowers or telekinetic abilities and stuff like that.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.460
One of them becomes evil.

05:01.460 --> 05:05.720
It's like almost like the plot for Akira but in the United States.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.720
But it looks really cool.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.280
I swear I have never heard of that ever.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.280
I'll find you a trailer.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.280
It's really cool looking.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.280
Interesting.

05:11.280 --> 05:16.160
No, I think our February movie we already decided is going to be the borrower's Miyazaki

05:16.160 --> 05:17.160
version.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.160
Yeah.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.160
The Studio Ghibli.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.160
Yes.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.040
Or I guess it's technically not a Miyazaki film, Studio Ghibli.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.400
So it's the secret of Arietty or something.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
Yeah.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.200
So, but anyway, anyway, we keep getting off track.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.840
The movie we did see for this month for January, you know, this is a very manly weekend for

05:32.840 --> 05:33.840
movies.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.840
There's so much out there.

05:34.840 --> 05:35.840
Joyful Noise.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.200
I'm sure everybody ran right after the big 49ers game yesterday to go see Joyful Noise.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.320
But we went to go see Beauty and the Beast 3D, you know, another very manly pick with

05:45.320 --> 05:46.640
all the football games this weekend.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.640
Yeah.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.640
But you know, come on, it's Disney.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.720
And you know how I feel about Disney and Beauty and the Beast really is one of the better,

05:51.720 --> 05:55.160
you know, Disney movies they did kind of part of that whole 90s Renaissance.

05:55.160 --> 06:00.280
So they did the whole 3D thing and we took our friend Victoria, who I think was on the

06:00.280 --> 06:04.760
show a long time ago, none of you guys probably remember her, but we all went and for three

06:04.760 --> 06:10.760
of us, it costs $51 to see Beauty and the Beast 3D, which is, you know, whatever.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
It's an event.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.760
Was the 3D worth it?

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
No.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.760
That's the point I wanted to get to.

06:14.760 --> 06:15.760
Absolutely.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.760
Positively not.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.960
And I have decided that is the last time I'm going to see one of these post-conversion

06:19.960 --> 06:22.120
3D movies.

06:22.120 --> 06:27.240
Even then I'm kind of over 3D, like 3D was really cool and Tron and actually Tangled

06:27.240 --> 06:28.240
was pretty good.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.340
I got to say, you know, but like Beauty and the Beast, I'm sorry, there were maybe two

06:31.340 --> 06:35.440
scenes in the entire movie that were slightly enhanced with 3D.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.440
And one of them, of course, is the ballroom scene.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.640
You guys all know the ballroom scene.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.280
Well, that's the only one that they actually rendered with a computer.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.880
They could do 3D on that.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.880
Exactly.

06:43.880 --> 06:44.880
Exactly.

06:44.880 --> 06:45.880
So they re-rendered it or whatever.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.680
Um, and then there was the, um, uh, Be Our Guest.

06:49.680 --> 06:53.880
They did some neat, there was like one shot in Be Our Guest where I was like, Ooh, 3D.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.880
And that was it.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.520
Oh, and there was a Tangled short beforehand that was really good.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.520
So, you know, whatever.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
Yeah.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.560
But, oh my gosh, there's like this rush of 3D movies coming out this year that are all

07:04.560 --> 07:05.800
just fucking 2D conversions.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
Okay.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
I remember the name of the movie now.

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
Chronicle.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.800
I haven't heard of it.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.400
I guess I'm just, this is why we need to see more movies.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.080
We can do an awesome, uh, bit of radio here and I could show you the trailer.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.680
This is what happens when Dark Sakura is not here.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.360
When it becomes a sausage fest, we can't stay on the topic of games.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.360
Now it's the movie show.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.360
Okay.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.920
Well, I was happy the fact, cause I mean, I don't know if you read, they were talking

07:28.920 --> 07:33.280
about doing a, you know, live action Akira, you know, it was going to be terrible cause

07:33.280 --> 07:37.200
it was going to be in the United States and just made no sense whatsoever.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.160
But, um, this actually looks pretty cool.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.760
And uh, let's see here.

07:41.760 --> 07:47.280
Before I get to that, uh, let's see, Chizuro in our chat room says $51.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.280
Fuck that shit.

07:48.280 --> 07:53.500
I would require to see some of Bell's Disney titties.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
There were no titties.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.700
It's a Disney movie.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.700
Come on.

07:56.700 --> 07:57.700
All right.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.700
All right.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.700
Let's see.

07:59.700 --> 08:00.700
Oh, am I really going to watch this live on air?

08:00.700 --> 08:01.700
Am I really derailing this show?

08:01.700 --> 08:07.320
Cause you know, I was trying to turn this all into a 3d games chat, but hold on here.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.640
Let's go back in and look.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
All right.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.820
I'm looking at this trailer.

08:11.820 --> 08:12.820
This is a two minute trail.

08:12.820 --> 08:13.820
I can't watch all this.

08:13.820 --> 08:14.820
It's going to derail the show too much.

08:14.820 --> 08:15.820
I'll watch a little bit.

08:15.820 --> 08:16.820
We'll just watch part of it.

08:16.820 --> 08:17.820
All right.

08:17.820 --> 08:25.400
I'm going to get this on camera.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.760
So what is this all like shot like Blair Witch project style?

08:27.760 --> 08:33.320
Uh, not exactly because they give me a countdown.

08:33.320 --> 08:37.600
The guy that doing this is, you know, using some common sense, figuring out, you know,

08:37.600 --> 08:40.200
this day and age people know how to operate a camera.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.520
Oh, I see.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.560
So it's more like a, uh, like people with their own iPhones.

08:45.560 --> 08:46.560
Whoa.

08:46.560 --> 08:54.520
That was like a full road dog moment there right there.

08:54.520 --> 09:00.320
So they're making a teddy bear dance with telekinetic powers and they're moving a car

09:00.320 --> 09:01.320
with their mind.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.240
Maybe fast forward it a little bit.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.920
So it's a movie about bros that get magneto powers basically, right?

09:08.920 --> 09:11.360
It's not a game.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.240
Stop this right now.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.560
This looks whatever.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.560
All right.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.560
Sure.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.560
It's cool.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
Whatever.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.560
Whatever.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
I'll get it on Netflix if nothing else.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.200
Um, what I want to, okay.

09:25.200 --> 09:31.200
So yes, my point was before I got so rudely derailed, um, they're converting all of this

09:31.200 --> 09:34.800
2d stuff into 3d because there were how many previews before we saw beauty and the beast?

09:34.800 --> 09:35.800
Like 11 billion.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.800
Right?

09:36.800 --> 09:37.800
Yeah.

09:37.800 --> 09:42.920
And it's finding Nemo back in theaters, star Wars, episode one back in theaters, finding

09:42.920 --> 09:48.040
me Titanic back in theaters, Titanic is stupid, but, uh, finding Nemo makes sense because

09:48.040 --> 09:52.840
it's all CG just re render for two points of view and the 3d will probably be pretty

09:52.840 --> 09:53.840
good on that.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.840
Yeah.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.120
But finding Nemo, I'll give a little bit of a pass, but I'm not paying 51 bucks to see

09:58.120 --> 09:59.120
it again.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
I'm sorry.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.120
It'll be on blu-ray.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.120
I could buy the blu-ray for half of that.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.120
You know what I mean?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
Yeah.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.680
So I'm kinda, but yeah, it basically anything CG animated is going to be perfect for 3d

10:08.680 --> 10:10.220
because you can render it.

10:10.220 --> 10:15.080
You can re render that so that it's 3d cause you just have to add some more camera angles.

10:15.080 --> 10:19.120
Uh, tiger claw in our chat room at chat.onorshaunter.com says it's Cloverfield, but with super powered

10:19.120 --> 10:22.360
teens at the Cloverfield might be a good, good analogy.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.080
I don't know, but here, here was my point is that, you know, they're converting all

10:25.080 --> 10:31.160
this 2d stuff into 3d and I got, I have to say the star Wars one, I mean, let alone that

10:31.160 --> 10:35.160
it's episode one, which was not a high point for the series.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.840
It didn't look that good to me.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.840
Like, yeah.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
Do you agree?

10:38.840 --> 10:39.840
Alan?

10:39.840 --> 10:40.840
I do.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.480
It was just kind of like, like it looked like it was kind of post production stuff.

10:43.480 --> 10:47.680
I mean, and I can't imagine how terrible the ones from the seventies are going to look

10:47.680 --> 10:49.920
with the whole post 3d.

10:49.920 --> 10:56.960
So I mean, I guess cool that is back in theaters for those that want to see it in 2d, but anyway,

10:56.960 --> 11:00.480
my point was now we're getting into more 3d games, right?

11:00.480 --> 11:02.760
And like 3d is kind of where gaming is going.

11:02.760 --> 11:07.360
And my thought is inevitably, inevitably there's going to be a point where we're going to start

11:07.360 --> 11:10.400
seeing games re-released in 3d.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.900
Wait for it because right, we had the halo collector or what halo anniversary edition

11:14.900 --> 11:15.900
this year, right?

11:15.900 --> 11:19.120
Which was the high definition remake of classic games.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.520
That's that's where the industry is right now.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.520
Right?

11:21.520 --> 11:22.520
We get all these high definition remakes.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.520
There's a little bit.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.520
There's a little bit of clarification though, there there's some HD remakes that are kind

11:27.520 --> 11:31.160
of cool where they take the game, remake it in a whole new engine.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.160
That's fine.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.880
The new art department, the final fantasy 10, which despite how you may or may not feel

11:34.880 --> 11:38.920
about final fantasy 10 in the series, the fact that they've come out and said they are

11:38.920 --> 11:39.920
remaking it.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.920
It is not an upgrade.

11:40.920 --> 11:41.920
Okay.

11:41.920 --> 11:48.640
Now like stuff, for example, the Melger solid collection or the, um, like even the God of

11:48.640 --> 11:53.680
war stuff is not really a new, I mean, it's mainly the Melger solid, so, cause that, that

11:53.680 --> 11:58.000
looked really blurry and kind of weird, but there's that silent Hill one coming out in

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
March.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.360
That's really weird because it's kind of just uprezzing, but they had to do all new voice

12:02.360 --> 12:06.520
acting because of the legal troubles that the, uh, one of the guys in the prior voice

12:06.520 --> 12:07.520
cast.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.520
Silent Hill's dead.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.920
I mean, seriously, that, that series, I can guarantee the new game's going to be terrible.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.760
I mean, it just, it's not, not what it used to be.

12:17.760 --> 12:22.400
They try and they try and they try to figure out what people want and it's just, they get

12:22.400 --> 12:23.400
it wrong.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.800
Every time a game grew in our chat room says Rick rad race.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.440
I almost said Ridge racer Ridge racer.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.440
I'm sure that'll be in 3d at some point too, but he's saying rad racer 3d here.

12:33.440 --> 12:37.400
Remember when the NES games were in 3d remember rad racer, you push select and it would do

12:37.400 --> 12:41.560
the red, blue 3d and there was one other, there was 3d world runner, I think was the

12:41.560 --> 12:42.560
other game.

12:42.560 --> 12:48.160
It was like actual 3d, but it was, it was really, really bad 3d.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.600
You know, it was eighties 3d.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.760
Well, they could easily do that now.

12:51.760 --> 12:52.760
First time we were in this phase.

12:52.760 --> 12:56.000
Well, doesn't Arkham city kind of do like a 3d like that?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.360
Not red, blue, but they do like the other type of glass.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.160
They have that available and they also have actual 3d.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
Yeah.

13:02.160 --> 13:08.800
But yeah, it's the, but although that technique is supposed to be to the point where the colors

13:08.800 --> 13:10.820
don't get all messed up from it.

13:10.820 --> 13:14.400
I don't know if that's true or not, but it apparently the glasses, I haven't actually

13:14.400 --> 13:21.080
used them are supposed to preserve the colors so that even though it is the green and kind

13:21.080 --> 13:24.320
of magenta, it's still okay.

13:24.320 --> 13:28.520
So how long do you guys think before 3d remakes become a big craze?

13:28.520 --> 13:31.760
And let's not forget, we did, this is already happening.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.280
If you doubt what we're saying, remember what was the big thing on the 3ds last year?

13:35.280 --> 13:40.160
Zelda 3d was like the only thing on that console worth having for awhile.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.360
And of course there was the star Fox remake as well.

13:42.360 --> 13:46.840
So they're already starting, but it's not even really, they're not even really necessarily

13:46.840 --> 13:48.160
putting that game in the 3d.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.360
It's just, it's once again, it's a new camera.

13:51.360 --> 13:56.520
I don't think that you're going to, you may see some more games ported to, um, to that

13:56.520 --> 13:57.520
system.

13:57.520 --> 14:02.160
And I wouldn't be surprised if super Mario, you know, um, 64 ends up being one of those

14:02.160 --> 14:03.800
cause that makes sense.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.960
But um, I just, that's the shit they should leave for virtual console.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.960
I just don't think they're going to, I don't think that's really going to be that popular

14:10.960 --> 14:14.360
because people don't really care about 3d on consoles right now.

14:14.360 --> 14:18.520
They have it there so they can kind of say, Hey, look, we support 3d and stuff, but it's

14:18.520 --> 14:22.560
not mainstream yet to where everybody has 3d TVs and everything.

14:22.560 --> 14:28.360
Cause even the 3d TVs, I mean the content out there is not very good so far.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.840
So I don't think it's going to be a major trend.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.340
You will see a ton more HD collections though.

14:34.340 --> 14:38.120
Everything's going to be fucking taken and put in the HD if you will.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
Yeah.

14:39.120 --> 14:44.640
But especially when we get into the next series of, um, you know, consoles is 3d inevitable.

14:44.640 --> 14:50.200
Like is, is 3d gaming really the future eventually, but I don't think it's going to be something

14:50.200 --> 14:54.360
that they, no, they may re release a bunch of stuff for it.

14:54.360 --> 14:59.560
Why not Alan, you're looking like you're dying to comment.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.080
I think that it should be available with the next generation of consoles, but if they just

15:03.080 --> 15:07.720
say this is it, like telling the consumers what they want rather than just seeing what

15:07.720 --> 15:09.800
the consumers want themselves.

15:09.800 --> 15:16.200
I don't, I don't care about 3d games because you've got the TV and the glasses and all

15:16.200 --> 15:17.200
that horseshit.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.440
It's like, don't stop it.

15:18.440 --> 15:23.760
Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com, uh, Kaijuto says, I have a 3d video convert

15:23.760 --> 15:28.520
and I watched the star Wars movies in 3d episode three look good with all the crazy colors.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.960
You mean those blue rays are already in 3d?

15:30.960 --> 15:34.760
I mean, the other thing about beauty and the beast, that shit's been on 3d blue rays since

15:34.760 --> 15:35.760
November.

15:35.760 --> 15:41.880
And when I found that out, I was like, Oh, well that was, you know, that some HDTVs already,

15:41.880 --> 15:45.720
the 3d HDTVs will convert 2d stuff into 3d.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.280
Oh my gosh.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.920
But a lot of it sucks.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.720
Uh, alpha canandagram says they did smooth the heck out of Zelda 3d.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.720
Well, they better.

15:53.720 --> 15:58.120
I mean, it's going to be on a, it looked like shit if they didn't do something to it.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.020
Steph on the N64 was so fucking ugly.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.200
I don't care how nostalgic you are for the game.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.360
It was an ugly system.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.640
The games on it looked like shit.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.640
It doesn't matter though.

16:05.640 --> 16:09.560
I mean, that system's old and that system was meant for, you know, standard definition

16:09.560 --> 16:10.560
TVs.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.020
And of course you have the scan lines and everything.

16:12.020 --> 16:16.280
So you would better do something to it cause it'll look like crap.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.880
Uh, let's see.

16:17.880 --> 16:22.220
Calfa or excuse me, Kaijuto in our chat room says they make way too many bucks in the video

16:22.220 --> 16:26.120
industry to really care about alpha canandagram 3d.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.440
I don't know why he said it that way.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.960
I think alpha canandagram must've made another comment earlier, but, um, yeah, I was thinking,

16:31.960 --> 16:32.960
wait a minute.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.240
I don't know if the video games industry is necessarily doing that well.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.120
I mean, I know we've heard about the movie industry was in a little bit of a slump this

16:38.120 --> 16:39.120
last year.

16:39.120 --> 16:43.160
Um, of course there wasn't a lot of great, great movies outside of, you know, like what

16:43.160 --> 16:46.700
the Harry Potter and you know, a couple other things here and there, um, that people really

16:46.700 --> 16:47.700
wanted to see.

16:47.700 --> 16:51.480
But video games, I seem to recall reading a story this week that December did not treat

16:51.480 --> 16:55.400
the gaming industry very well, especially if your name was Nintendo, uh, we Nintendo

16:55.400 --> 16:59.680
wheat specifically, I guess 3ds obviously is, is, has made a huge rebound, but Nintendo

16:59.680 --> 17:04.240
we, as we all figured would happen, what's, what is there on the Wii right now?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.960
There was no title for it this Christmas and they paid for it.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.960
Well, here's the vape.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.520
No, they had fortune street to be fair.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
They had fortune.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.760
Like I said, they had no title on it.

17:13.760 --> 17:18.680
This, I mean, apologies if you're a four team out two weeks after Zelda.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
Okay.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
So what do you need?

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
That's right.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.680
They had skyward sword.

17:22.680 --> 17:29.120
I forgot that skyward sword, but here's the, see, it got lost because, okay, but for real,

17:29.120 --> 17:34.760
it got lost amongst the Skyrim, the saints road, the, you know, just, it was a huge year

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
this year.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.840
Well, here's the thing too.

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
One game wasn't enough.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.840
I got it.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.840
I got to tell you, here's the thing.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.280
The Wii, not a lot of stuff coming out for it.

17:42.280 --> 17:48.960
I mean, yeah, they've announced Mario party seven and a rhythm heaven fever, but those

17:48.960 --> 17:51.080
are the Nintendo first party stuff.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.080
Third party.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.840
There's not much for the Wii right now.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.640
There's a bunch of games that have been delayed forever that have just still floating around.

17:58.640 --> 18:04.000
But I mean, if you look at the release list, as far as Wii titles are concerned, it's pretty

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
dead.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.240
And that's kind of a sign that, you know, it's, they're going to stop making Wii games

18:09.240 --> 18:11.000
soon enough.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I did find it nice or refreshing.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.360
I should say that EA has finally dropped the PlayStation two as far as some of their sports

18:18.360 --> 18:19.360
games are concerned.

18:19.360 --> 18:25.040
They usually do a Madden game, even though, you know, no one's really playing PlayStation

18:25.040 --> 18:26.280
two stuff anymore.

18:26.280 --> 18:32.680
But they did one last year and actually they did an original Xbox in 2010, even though

18:32.680 --> 18:35.720
that system had been done for a while.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.280
And the PSP is going the same way too.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.580
So the PSP is going to drop off the face of the earth this year.

18:40.580 --> 18:44.600
And obviously PlayStation two already is, but I think the Wii is going to drop pretty

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
fast.

18:45.600 --> 18:50.360
It's going to be gone by the time the Wii U comes out, or at least, I mean, they may

18:50.360 --> 18:54.160
be putting out a couple things, but it's going to go kind of the way the PlayStation two

18:54.160 --> 18:55.160
is right now.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.320
It's going to be like Disney channel games and you know, just kiddie stuff.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.920
Not even necessarily that, it's like really, really small third parties that, and that's

19:01.920 --> 19:08.960
all that really have, like, yeah, like Kokum, Oxygen Games, you know, Crave.

19:08.960 --> 19:13.800
They have a few games coming out, but they're, I mean, I don't know when they're coming out

19:13.800 --> 19:18.400
because they keep getting delayed and delayed and delayed.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.200
But it's not anything really mainstream.

19:20.200 --> 19:25.400
Although, like I said, Nintendo does have Mario Party 7, which is kind of like eh, and

19:25.400 --> 19:28.760
Rhythm Heaven Fever, which I know some people are looking forward to, but it's not anything

19:28.760 --> 19:31.520
like a mainstream peel.

19:31.520 --> 19:37.000
Mario Party will have a mainstream peel, but Rhythm Heaven, most people could skip that.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.040
All right.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.720
As if I didn't look like a big enough idiot forgetting about Zelda, I have a little correction

19:42.720 --> 19:43.880
to make here.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.720
Shane's listening and he's a huge Silent Hill fan and linked me to this thing that's on

19:47.720 --> 19:49.120
the Silent Hill Facebook.

19:49.120 --> 19:54.240
Apparently, the original voices will still be in the Silent Hill collection for Silent

19:54.240 --> 19:55.240
Hill 2.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.920
And you're going to be able to switch back and forth between original voices and new

19:58.920 --> 19:59.920
voices.

19:59.920 --> 20:05.400
But Silent Hill 3 will only have the new voices, but they will be, I mean, in my opinion, 2

20:05.400 --> 20:10.600
is the better game, but I know 3 has its huge fans, 3 was a great game too.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.980
And they say in their official little release here on Facebook, quote, unfortunately due

20:14.980 --> 20:20.520
to factors both technical and logistical, Silent Hill 3 will be presented with new voices

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
only.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.400
Yeah, technical and logistical.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.400
And legal.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.400
Cha-ching!

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
Money!

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
But there you go.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.400
All right.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.880
Anyhow, okay, enough talk about 3D and all that stuff.

20:31.880 --> 20:32.880
Let's move on.

20:32.880 --> 20:36.520
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the stuff that we have been playing this week.

20:36.520 --> 20:41.280
Usually Dark Soccer starts us off, so I'll let Salacious Pop go.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.280
Let's see.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.280
I'm sorry, Alan.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
Yeah.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.080
I keep forgetting, you go by your name now and not an online name.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.440
Well, it's just, it's too wordy to say over the air.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.440
Fair enough.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.720
The two big games I'm playing right now, aside from WoW, and I am playing a little bit more

20:53.720 --> 21:00.080
WoW than I was, is Skyrim and Dragon Age 2.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.800
I'm trying to juggle between the two of those.

21:02.800 --> 21:07.800
Since I got the DSi XL for Christmas, I've also been playing, oddly enough, Legend of

21:07.800 --> 21:12.480
Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.200
The stylus-only controls are actually really good, they did a good job on it.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.120
I have the little feather-shaped stylus as the pre-order bonus, so I got it when it was

21:21.120 --> 21:22.120
brand new.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.120
And I'm only just now playing it.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.120
It's like a five-year-old game.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.120
A six-year-old game.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.760
But yeah, it's pretty good.

21:26.760 --> 21:31.840
Played some Puyo Pop Fever in the car today.

21:31.840 --> 21:32.840
So yeah.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.880
In Skyrim, I'm at about 40, 41 hours.

21:35.880 --> 21:41.680
I've got an orc, he's mace, one hand, and a shield, so he's kind of like a tank.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.240
Sort of basic and boring, but at least they just beat up on things and they die.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.200
Yeah, about 40 hours, level 25, level 26.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.960
And I did cheat to give myself gold because I could not take being broke and always being

21:52.960 --> 21:54.200
in my inventory cap anymore.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.560
So clearly you're a PC player.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.560
Yeah.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.360
Have you experimented with any of those mods, like the ones that are supposed to enhance

21:59.360 --> 22:00.360
your performance?

22:00.360 --> 22:07.040
Yeah, I have a world map replacer that shows me where all the roads are in a way that isn't

22:07.040 --> 22:11.160
like all fakie and it's not too obtrusive looking.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.880
So I've got a map replacer for the world map, so I don't get quite as lost.

22:14.880 --> 22:15.880
Which is cheating.

22:15.880 --> 22:16.880
Well, yeah.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.120
That is absolutely cheating.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.120
Absolutely cheating.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.200
If you dodge the giant camps, you're cheating.

22:23.200 --> 22:28.200
If you follow the compass, that game will just take you right off cliffs, and I'm like,

22:28.200 --> 22:31.040
no, I gotta go, here's the road that goes around, I'm gonna take the road.

22:31.040 --> 22:36.200
I find that when it directs me towards a mountain, I just go straight up the mountain, just keep

22:36.200 --> 22:39.520
hitting jump and pushing forward and you'll eventually clear that mountain.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.520
Attaboy.

22:40.520 --> 22:46.360
So yeah, I have a map replacer and the best add-on for Skyrim, and it sucks that console

22:46.360 --> 22:47.600
users can't do this.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.480
Your favorites, like the spells and the items and the weapons that you put the little star

22:52.480 --> 22:56.880
by so you can just do your quick select menu, there's an add-on for that that organizes

22:56.880 --> 23:00.520
everything, and then also just a bag manager.

23:00.520 --> 23:05.180
So I can sort stuff by weight and see like, why am I always at my weight cap?

23:05.180 --> 23:07.600
What the fuck do I have that's so heavy?

23:07.600 --> 23:11.800
And then I can sort by, oh, these only weigh a pound, but I have 70 of them, so I can put

23:11.800 --> 23:13.800
that at the top and then sell them off.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.960
That's what happens when you collect cheese wheels.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.780
Yeah.

23:18.780 --> 23:22.520
And the bug that I had that I mentioned on last week's show did fix itself, I think I

23:22.520 --> 23:27.120
mentioned that too, where everyone in Dragon's Reach hated me and thought I was a murderous

23:27.120 --> 23:31.480
criminal, but yet the guards in the town were like, sup bro, what you doing?

23:31.480 --> 23:33.520
Like your armor, bro.

23:33.520 --> 23:37.040
And then the Jarl and his little dark elf bodyguard were like, fucking get him.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.600
And I'm like, I didn't do anything.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.200
This game is bugged as hell.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.200
Yeah, that's fine now.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.840
All right.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.800
Vidpower in our chat room says, performance enhancing mods.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.280
It's the steroids of Skyrim.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.760
Eh, that's a good comparison.

23:50.760 --> 23:56.480
Well, I haven't used the dev console in any way to give myself stats or points or skills

23:56.480 --> 23:57.480
or anything.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.640
Just, I got myself enough gold to buy a house with some chests in it to throw my shit in

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
and that's it.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.080
Did you fuck Lydia yet?

24:04.080 --> 24:08.640
No, I don't have a, um, I don't have a spouse.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.080
You know you can buy the house with actually spending the money.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.080
Oh really?

24:12.080 --> 24:16.360
See, I don't want to use the exploits or the invisible chest either.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.560
I'd rather just give myself 20K gold and then I'm done.

24:19.560 --> 24:23.000
Hey, if they didn't want me using that, they could patch that out right away.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.840
But apparently they still want me to use it.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.960
I think part, part of the fun, I think they realized that part of the fun with the sandbox

24:27.960 --> 24:30.480
game like Skyrim is people hacking it and fucking with it.

24:30.480 --> 24:33.220
So I don't think Bethesda is going to patch that out.

24:33.220 --> 24:34.740
If people are having fun with it, they don't care.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.160
It's not an online game.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.120
That's probably a big part of the reason why they're not going MMO with it, at least right

24:39.120 --> 24:40.120
now.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
I think it's inevitable.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.120
There's an elder scrolls MMO.

24:42.120 --> 24:46.040
Oh my God, that would be the buggiest piece of shit ever.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.320
It's going to be a beta test for six years.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.320
Yeah, right, like they'll beta test anything with that.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.320
It's good.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.320
You sure?

24:54.320 --> 24:55.320
Did you check?

24:55.320 --> 24:58.040
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good.

24:58.040 --> 25:05.080
And Dragon Age 2 is awesome, but it's hard to juggle two meaty games like DA2 and Skyrim.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.040
All right, let's move on to Loki.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.440
Loki, how was your gaming week?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.200
My gaming week was pretty good.

25:10.200 --> 25:15.040
I just played mainly Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, and Skyrim.

25:15.040 --> 25:20.440
Skyrim I'm mainly talking about because no one wants to hear about Call of Duty, Modern

25:20.440 --> 25:21.440
Warfare.

25:21.440 --> 25:26.680
So I have to say one of the best weapons in the game, I don't know if you've come across

25:26.680 --> 25:29.660
this yet, Alan, but the Wabbajack.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.920
The Wabbajack is awesome.

25:30.920 --> 25:37.320
The Wabbajack is a staff that casts, or it transforms things into random things.

25:37.320 --> 25:42.960
So for example, you can cast it on people, and the first time I hit somebody with it,

25:42.960 --> 25:49.080
it kind of went all Scott Pilgrim and they exploded into coins, or it turns them into

25:49.080 --> 25:58.240
a rabbit, or into a daedra, or a goat, or makes them invisible, or just all sorts of

25:58.240 --> 25:59.960
crazy stuff.

25:59.960 --> 26:04.680
So that's a pretty fun weapon to mess around with.

26:04.680 --> 26:10.920
And then, actually the quest to get that was also really weird, which is pretty fun.

26:10.920 --> 26:16.040
But yeah, the game is still really glitchy for me, I just gave up on that one quest that

26:16.040 --> 26:20.760
I can't get to the person because they're under the map.

26:20.760 --> 26:25.760
Just like, well there's no way to get this person, so to hell with this.

26:25.760 --> 26:34.960
And I'm still having fun with it, I'm level 41 I think?

26:34.960 --> 26:39.400
Maybe a little further along than that, I don't know, but I think I capped out a few

26:39.400 --> 26:48.760
different skills already, my blacksmithing I know, alchemy, and some other stuff.

26:48.760 --> 26:54.640
It's still fun, I just didn't play any this weekend, although I probably will tonight.

26:54.640 --> 27:01.400
But yeah, still wasting tons of time in that game, I think I have 90 hours in it now.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.400
Alright, anything else?

27:03.400 --> 27:07.200
No, that's all I play this week.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.200
Alright.

27:08.200 --> 27:13.120
My Gaming Week, yeah there's really nothing new out right now, so I've kind of been revisiting

27:13.120 --> 27:14.920
a lot of older stuff.

27:14.920 --> 27:19.040
I fired up PlayStation 3 and I was like, I want to play something that I haven't beat

27:19.040 --> 27:20.040
on PlayStation 3 yet.

27:20.040 --> 27:24.440
And so I put in 3D.GameHeroes, which is what, about 3 years old, but that was a fun little

27:24.440 --> 27:28.040
game, so I put that in to kind of go back into that world.

27:28.040 --> 27:33.340
Which if you've never played it, is the Zelda, I don't want to say rip-off, because I called

27:33.340 --> 27:36.920
it that somewhere else and somebody was like, it's not a rip-off, it's more inspired by

27:36.920 --> 27:40.240
it, and I'm like, okay, but it really is like Zelda.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.280
So fine, inspired by Zelda.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.240
I'm sorry, I didn't remember one thing I played.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.240
Oh, shut up.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.240
Very quickly.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
Alright, what?

27:47.240 --> 27:48.240
Mole cart for the iOS.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.240
Oh god.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.800
Alright, that's coming up in the show later, so hold on.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.800
Hold off.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.800
Yeah.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.880
Alright, let's see, what else did I play this week?

27:56.880 --> 28:02.840
I played, I will say on the new front, I did check out that Final Fantasy 13.2 demo, like

28:02.840 --> 28:06.240
I think a lot of you guys have, because that's one of the big things that's holding people

28:06.240 --> 28:09.080
over right now, that came out on the marketplace this week.

28:09.080 --> 28:14.040
I really liked the demo, but of course, you know, disclaimer, I also really liked Final

28:14.040 --> 28:19.400
Fantasy 13, and I realized the gamer populace as a whole had its problems with it for being

28:19.400 --> 28:20.400
too linear.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.280
He was too linear, and there's no towns, and you can only do one thing.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.920
Which, and the character design is dah-dah-dah-dah, although if you, I mean, and I get it, I mean

28:27.920 --> 28:33.320
I'm not excusing it, but I just will say, if you stick with the game, you will find

28:33.320 --> 28:36.320
that Vanille has multiple layers to her.

28:36.320 --> 28:41.200
She is not all hee-hee girl, like there is definitely a past there that she might be

28:41.200 --> 28:42.200
putting on a front.

28:42.200 --> 28:47.040
Like, I'm just saying, if you stick with it for the 25 hours, you will find more about

28:47.040 --> 28:48.040
these characters.

28:48.040 --> 28:52.080
Hope will get balls later, but the problem is, you know, again, you have to stick with

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
it for 20, 25 hours.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.080
And you know what?

28:54.080 --> 28:55.080
I can't expect most gamers are going to do that.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.000
I need to go and finish Lost Odyssey.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.040
That was a fucking great game, and I really wish they'd make a sequel, but they probably

29:01.040 --> 29:02.040
won't.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.040
But anyway, stop derailing me.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.040
I'll be here all night tonight.

29:04.040 --> 29:08.080
But, yeah, the Final Fantasy 13 2 demo, in the little bit I played, and obviously it's

29:08.080 --> 29:12.600
just a demo, it's a little taste of the game, but they definitely are trying to throw things

29:12.600 --> 29:17.580
out there like, hey, look at what we changed from Final Fantasy 13.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.680
First off, the Crystalarium.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.040
Much easier, and not as big of a pain in the ass.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.640
You know, it's much easier to use.

29:23.640 --> 29:28.200
Hey, look, townspeople, where you can talk to random people and they'll tell you things

29:28.200 --> 29:31.960
and it kind of feels like a town, and you have multiple places you can go.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.880
Like, they're definitely trying to sneak all this in the demo.

29:34.880 --> 29:39.400
And then on top of that, you know, I found it interesting that your party is actually

29:39.400 --> 29:44.360
only two people, and your third character is that monster.

29:44.360 --> 29:50.040
And your monster can be one of three monsters, but the monsters all fall into one of the

29:50.040 --> 29:54.060
different categories, like Sentinel, or Commando, or Ravager.

29:54.060 --> 29:57.200
If you're familiar with Final Fantasy 13, these are kind of the character classes.

29:57.200 --> 30:01.320
So it's kind of like a build your own third character, is really what it feels like.

30:01.320 --> 30:05.900
To get the types of paradigms that you want, which, you know, I fucking love the battle

30:05.900 --> 30:06.900
system in 13.

30:06.900 --> 30:10.120
It's one of its huge strengths, and Final Fantasy 13 too is really just expanding on

30:10.120 --> 30:14.580
that with letting you kind of even go further with the paradigms.

30:14.580 --> 30:23.040
And I know this character has her haters, but I will say Chocolina is amazing.

30:23.040 --> 30:29.040
Chocolina's like half Vegas showgirl, half Chocobo cosplayer at a Dinky Automation.

30:29.040 --> 30:33.360
It's like Carnaval in Argentina or something, or Rio de Janeiro.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.360
It's pretty bad.

30:35.360 --> 30:41.880
And she has a voice actor like this, and she just sounds like she's so happy!

30:41.880 --> 30:43.280
I was dyin'.

30:43.280 --> 30:47.600
And I immediately went on all my Warcraft servers and reserved the name Chocolina for

30:47.600 --> 30:52.400
future use, possibly with Pandarins later on.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.800
So I guess that was really about it, I'm trying to think if there was anything else.

30:55.800 --> 31:00.360
Yes, I went back and started playing Retro Game Challenge on the DS again, because again

31:00.360 --> 31:03.160
I was kind of revisiting old games I wanted to play again.

31:03.160 --> 31:09.320
And Retro Game Challenge was an awesome DS game, especially if you liked 8-bit classics.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.480
That's pretty much it for my gaming week.

31:11.480 --> 31:17.080
So let's go to, I'm trying to see if our, in the chatroom at chat.orangelaunchmedia.com,

31:17.080 --> 31:19.840
Hitstun in our chatroom says, I thought the full game was out already.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.720
January 31st is the full game.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.720
Yeah, very close.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.720
Same day as Soulcalibur V, right?

31:23.720 --> 31:24.720
Yep.

31:24.720 --> 31:25.720
It's gonna be a busy week.

31:25.720 --> 31:26.720
You're dead also.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.720
Ooh, busy week.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.720
Busy week.

31:28.720 --> 31:33.880
Yeah, it gets, it's weird, it kind of gets busy for, actually starting from the 31st,

31:33.880 --> 31:34.880
which is very unusual.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.560
February has a lot of big games.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.560
All the delayed games.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.560
Oh, Mass Effect in February, right?

31:38.560 --> 31:39.560
That's March.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.560
Oh, March.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.560
Wow.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.560
Dang, it's gonna, it's gonna get busy.

31:42.560 --> 31:54.040
Yeah, it's, February is Binary Domain, Twisted Metal, UFC 3, no I'm thinking, forgetting

31:54.040 --> 32:00.600
a ton of shit, SSX, I'm looking forward to SSX.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.480
Well, we'll get into the releases a little later.

32:02.480 --> 32:07.000
SSA100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchmedia.com says, I never got through disc one of Final

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Fantasy 13.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
I really need to finish it.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.860
Now, see, I played on PlayStation 3, so it was just one big disc, so I don't know where

32:12.860 --> 32:17.680
disc one is in the story, but I will say this.

32:17.680 --> 32:22.840
If you can get yourself all the way to chapter 11, chapter 11 is when the game takes a big

32:22.840 --> 32:31.000
shift and bankruptcy right kind of I think it's 11 is it 10 or 11 but there's a spoiler

32:31.000 --> 32:35.020
alert although the game's been out for how long you do end up on grand pulse and that's

32:35.020 --> 32:39.020
when the game really opens up and now you have little side quests you can do and there

32:39.020 --> 32:44.560
is a little bit more semblance of a world but I don't it it's not that same feeling

32:44.560 --> 32:48.720
like in Final Fantasy 7 when you get out of Midgar and then all of a sudden holy shit

32:48.720 --> 32:54.320
world map like it's not that great but I get the sense that Final Fantasy 13 2 is going

32:54.320 --> 32:59.760
to start with that kind of chapter 11 feeling right up front and I'm not talking about bankruptcy

32:59.760 --> 33:03.520
so I'm really excited about the game I already have my pre-ordered and now I'm realizing

33:03.520 --> 33:07.920
shit I gotta get I have to get a PlayStation Vita and I have to get Soulcalibur 5 I'm gonna

33:07.920 --> 33:13.240
be broke you don't have to why do you have to get a Vita cuz I want it because he makes

33:13.240 --> 33:19.080
bad choices yes because you want luminous right yeah it's not a launch title oh it's

33:19.080 --> 33:23.280
not I thought it was nope maybe I'll wait till luminous is out then just give it some

33:23.280 --> 33:27.880
time I mean because if they're talking about it bombing as quickly as they think it is

33:27.880 --> 33:33.360
you might want to wait just a little bit all right all right we'll see we'll see all right

33:33.360 --> 33:41.200
um in fact luminous isn't even on their release list yet for Ubisoft all right let's move

33:41.200 --> 33:46.320
on um some quick housekeeping going on tonight of course follow us on Twitter and Facebook

33:46.320 --> 33:51.400
twitter.com slash olr or Facebook facebook.com slash orange launch radio you can follow us

33:51.400 --> 33:54.720
on there and we'll give you a little previews on what's coming up on the night show and

33:54.720 --> 34:00.720
so forth also our website orange launch radio.com we are in early talks about talking about

34:00.720 --> 34:04.400
some upgrades for the website for this year's that's really awesome especially the forums

34:04.400 --> 34:08.840
we really want to and somebody was commenting on Facebook today about the forums like forums

34:08.840 --> 34:12.480
need to get cleaned up we're like yeah we know we really want to make that workable

34:12.480 --> 34:16.680
again so I hope you guys will be ready for that when it's done which hopefully will be

34:16.680 --> 34:21.300
in the next month that'd be cool and I'm gonna plug the spin-off show Hoard House if you

34:21.300 --> 34:26.560
like World of Warcraft we have a whole nother show about World of Warcraft but it's not

34:26.560 --> 34:33.400
that serious just like this show hoardhouse.com if you want to check that out h-o-r-d-e-h-o-u-s-e.com

34:33.400 --> 34:37.260
think that's everything I want to plug tonight I guess so so let's get into some gaming news

34:37.260 --> 34:43.960
Loki I guess actually it's conflicting information Amazon saying it is a launch title but Ubisoft's

34:43.960 --> 34:49.100
not whatever um okay so let's talk a little bit about the Vita since we were just talking

34:49.100 --> 34:55.400
about the Vita one of the things that was announced during CES was music unlimited was

34:55.400 --> 34:59.640
gonna be something that's gonna feature or be featured on the Vita when it launches here

34:59.640 --> 35:06.960
in North America and of course that's Sony's cloud-based music service that I think they

35:06.960 --> 35:10.960
actually have on the PlayStation 3 right now as well one of the other things that they

35:10.960 --> 35:18.120
did announce as well is a kind of a video editor called a play memories and that's going

35:18.120 --> 35:25.960
to be for the PlayStation 3 and I also believe the Vita as well which is kind of neat oh

35:25.960 --> 35:32.320
maybe only in the ps3 I thought it was also on the Vita and they'll allow you to manipulate

35:32.320 --> 35:37.440
photos and videos through the ps3 I thought they had a video editor I thought they had

35:37.440 --> 35:41.680
one that came with the eye camera that you could do I thought they had something very

35:41.680 --> 35:46.840
basic too but this sounds like a little bit better than that maybe a version 2.0 or something

35:46.840 --> 35:54.720
okay and of course some sales numbers came out as well the Vita has sold 500,000 units

35:54.720 --> 36:01.880
in Japan and of course they're saying that also we're gonna be expecting Netflix to be

36:01.880 --> 36:08.320
coming to it as well near launch on Europe and United States not a big surprise Netflix

36:08.320 --> 36:15.520
is on everything so it would be kind of lost if it wasn't on the Vita as well so no big

36:15.520 --> 36:23.380
surprise there also the data plans for the Vita if you buy the 3G version have come out

36:23.380 --> 36:30.840
18 he's gonna charge you $14.99 a month and this is of course no contract $14.99 if you

36:30.840 --> 36:40.880
want 250 megabytes per month and $25 per month if you want two gigabyte cap and honestly

36:40.880 --> 36:44.560
I mean since you're not gonna be using 3G to download games because that'd be so fucking

36:44.560 --> 36:52.760
slow I would recommend I don't know I'd recommend not getting the 3G version to be honest save

36:52.760 --> 36:58.280
some money and just there's some folks in chat room Tiki in chat says I'm going for

36:58.280 --> 37:08.000
broke 3G all-in alpha-kinanagram in 3d says getting 3G for the hell of it GPS okay GPS

37:08.000 --> 37:12.560
then why not I would just recommend getting enough game like a virgin mobile phone or

37:12.560 --> 37:19.100
something like that I pay 25 bucks a month unlimited data it's also 3G and it's a phone

37:19.100 --> 37:28.480
so and if you route it you can tether to it so I got 3G anyways but yeah that uh if you

37:28.480 --> 37:33.360
want to get the 3G version power more power to eat I guess but that's what's gonna cost

37:33.360 --> 37:40.280
you all right I was trying to look up um how the 3ds sold when it originally came out in

37:40.280 --> 37:43.240
Japan because I'm getting you know a lot of people are really dogging on the Vita and

37:43.240 --> 37:47.200
its sales numbers but how did this compare to the 3ds because the 3ds had a lot of growing

37:47.200 --> 37:52.320
pains too you know obviously that was kind of a very slow build so I mean is it really

37:52.320 --> 37:57.120
fair to be razzing on the Vita when the 3ds had its share of launch problems I mean not

37:57.120 --> 38:03.960
hardware necessarily but you know just quality of software I think I teased you that you

38:03.960 --> 38:07.840
want to get the Vita on launch day because it's important to you that they lower the

38:07.840 --> 38:12.240
price of the Vita six months later then have an ambassador program where you get fucking

38:12.240 --> 38:15.480
crash bandicoot and they're like that's all the vintage shit we have sorry thanks here

38:15.480 --> 38:19.560
you go so you can be mad about something else I would hope for a Final Fantasy game but

38:19.560 --> 38:24.360
I guess that's the wrong company it's got to be a first party so all right um also go

38:24.360 --> 38:28.120
into our chat room at chat.orangeonshoot.com Rama says if you're smart get the Vita from

38:28.120 --> 38:33.200
AT&T it'll be $99 with the two-year contract really is that true I didn't hear about that

38:33.200 --> 38:36.920
sounds interesting it's price speculation because there's no contracts for it so you

38:36.920 --> 38:41.960
know there could maybe there's a arrangement that AT&T could have though uh Rama says tether

38:41.960 --> 38:47.160
off your smartphones people uh SGO under Matt says I don't see the point of the 3G since

38:47.160 --> 38:53.000
it's Wi-Fi everywhere that's true there's lots of Wi-Fi everywhere I swear my 3DS got

38:53.000 --> 38:56.640
on Wi-Fi while I was at the movie like there was an open network and it just kind of joined

38:56.640 --> 38:59.880
it because my light was suddenly flashing blue because you know how the light on the

38:59.880 --> 39:04.920
3DS is green for I walked by somebody who has a 3DS like mine's glowing green now because

39:04.920 --> 39:09.020
it talked to Loki's device obviously and then it glows blue when it's oh I got a swap note

39:09.020 --> 39:15.380
from the internet it's interesting all right anyhow let's talk about some PC gaming obviously

39:15.380 --> 39:22.460
one big PC game we're gonna get at some point in 2012 is Diablo 3 now there was a very interesting

39:22.460 --> 39:27.720
kind of controversy this week with Diablo 3 where Bashyok one of the community managers

39:27.720 --> 39:32.480
for Blizzard posted on Twitter essentially that Diablo 3 was confirmed for consoles he

39:32.480 --> 39:38.900
didn't say that but he did answer a user question saying oh well that's already in the works

39:38.900 --> 39:44.120
and so and so is the manager behind it basically so it pretty much confirmed without confirming

39:44.120 --> 39:47.880
it that there is a version in the works but then Blizzard came back and quickly kind of

39:47.880 --> 39:51.820
revoked that tweet saying you know we have no announcement on that at this time but come

39:51.820 --> 39:56.240
on people we've known for forever Blizzard's been hiring the people for consoles they're

39:56.240 --> 40:02.580
at least exploring a Diablo 3 they'll probably do it but my question is with the real money

40:02.580 --> 40:07.620
auction house how the hell is that gonna work on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network because

40:07.620 --> 40:11.660
I can't see that they're gonna be able to run something like that on those services

40:11.660 --> 40:15.580
and that's gonna be a huge money maker for Diablo 3 and essentially fund the whole online

40:15.580 --> 40:21.180
multiplayer part of it although I don't know I'm not interested in the real money auction

40:21.180 --> 40:25.540
house at all personally but I know some people are thinking they're gonna become millionaires

40:25.540 --> 40:30.060
off of it but as we've talked a little bit on Horde house about supply versus demand

40:30.060 --> 40:35.780
there'll be plenty of supply but will the will there be demand so sorry to derail you

40:35.780 --> 40:40.940
again yeah for good at that tonight by the way yeah I was going back to what you're saying

40:40.940 --> 40:45.220
about the 3ds now how often or how far from launch were you talking about for numbers

40:45.220 --> 40:57.620
I guess well the couple okay so within the first I'd say week they sold two hundred and

40:57.620 --> 41:04.020
I'm sorry it five hundred and eighty two thousand in the US or Japan this is Japan okay all

41:04.020 --> 41:10.980
right fair enough so in in about a week so yeah they're a little head all right that's

41:10.980 --> 41:20.140
fair so but it isn't millions you know but yeah like hey so yeah because it's a 3ds and

41:20.140 --> 41:25.500
long people yeah launched in February or towards the end of February and by the end of March

41:25.500 --> 41:34.100
they were about 800,000 yen's in Japan hmm all right so 3ds was ahead all right also

41:34.100 --> 41:39.460
in the Diablo 3 front one other thing I wanted to say is that one fact that could be holding

41:39.460 --> 41:43.660
up the game or people have been speculating it hold up the game from a global launch that

41:43.660 --> 41:47.860
Blizzard is insisted on doing is the ratings in South Korea the game has not been able

41:47.860 --> 41:51.300
to be rated in South Korea for forever and a lot of that is because of the real money

41:51.300 --> 41:56.860
auction house well the news came out this week that Diablo 3 was officially rated it's

41:56.860 --> 42:02.140
rated 18 plus according to the game's rating board page and so that means that now it's

42:02.140 --> 42:08.840
been rated everywhere so Blizzard how about a release date unless there is truly something

42:08.840 --> 42:12.540
else holding up the release of this game that is highly anticipated anyone else looking

42:12.540 --> 42:16.580
forward to Diablo 3 or is it just me of course I'm getting a free one thanks to the Warcraft

42:16.580 --> 42:23.380
blood pact but yeah I'm getting it and installing it even if I don't play it just because I

42:23.380 --> 42:28.660
signed it for the contract as well yeah it took me a couple weeks but is that they took

42:28.660 --> 42:32.140
that down right you can't do that anymore I think you still can in fact it with the

42:32.140 --> 42:37.620
news was circulating gaming sites again like I saw it pop up on one of the new communities

42:37.620 --> 42:40.780
on live journal I've been following his own TD games because now oh no they didn't as

42:40.780 --> 42:45.060
a games community and the story popped up on there like it was new news and it was sourced

42:45.060 --> 42:50.980
to do a site that had just run it this week so I think Blizzard is putting it out there

42:50.980 --> 42:55.240
again for whatever reason but yeah you can still sign up for it so hey if you want to

42:55.240 --> 42:58.300
tell Blizzard you're gonna give them money every month for 12 months I think they're

42:58.300 --> 43:04.340
gonna let you do it I just think the rewards are gonna change at some point so and for

43:04.340 --> 43:08.460
the record no I'm not excited about Diablo 3 you just but you you never really played

43:08.460 --> 43:14.860
Diablo 2 did you I played Diablo 1 I liked I have one why not why not uh the three then

43:14.860 --> 43:20.440
I just I don't play that much on PC it doesn't seem like you know right now I'm doing a lot

43:20.440 --> 43:25.380
of like kind of looting and grinding and Skyrim and that kind of fulfills my need for Skyrim

43:25.380 --> 43:31.340
you know doing looting and grinding I mean I don't need another game to do that Shane

43:31.340 --> 43:35.340
by the way looked up the whole luminous thing in private message it's coming up February

43:35.340 --> 43:39.500
coming out February 22nd is the release date so it's launch window like that first month

43:39.500 --> 43:44.060
it's like go this way it's not on it's not an Ubisoft release list yet I still think

43:44.060 --> 43:49.900
that's tentative I don't think that it's actually coming out that day yet I would trust Ubisoft

43:49.900 --> 43:56.460
in their information you know because they just sent us the update about Ghost Recon

43:56.460 --> 44:02.060
being delayed to May but it's it's not on the release list I will ask this week though

44:02.060 --> 44:06.180
because I was curious than that myself especially since they have box art now that usually means

44:06.180 --> 44:11.340
that's close and the song list and luminous and well hot and and they could very well

44:11.340 --> 44:17.700
say oh yeah here it's coming down the 14th or 22nd or whatever so all right let's move

44:17.700 --> 44:24.000
on Alan what do you have for us there is a huge promotional campaign being spearheaded

44:24.000 --> 44:30.340
by Microsoft for Xbox Live Arcade called the Xbox Live Arcade house party 2012 and I trying

44:30.340 --> 44:36.500
to figure out what exactly this is sounds kind of dippy I guess it's just a huge hey

44:36.500 --> 44:40.060
arcade is awesome and we've got great games on it released directly to arcade and their

44:40.060 --> 44:45.980
exclusives and rah rah rah let's spend money on arcade games that's pretty much it actually

44:45.980 --> 44:49.960
have you heard of the summer of arcade yeah yeah it's the same thing it's the same thing

44:49.960 --> 44:55.460
in the winter yeah so the 2012 of the hurrah our XBLA is so awesome it's going to start

44:55.460 --> 45:03.900
on February 15th with the titles Alan wakes American night Alan wakes American nightmare

45:03.900 --> 45:11.460
the long-awaited I am alive EA's warp and a game that's the name is spelled so confusingly

45:11.460 --> 45:17.300
I think it's just deliberately there to troll it's any X you IZ which I'm calling nezou

45:17.300 --> 45:26.420
ease Nexus maybe next Nexus yeah I like next to ease though you sound exquisite so yeah

45:26.420 --> 45:31.200
those four games we don't really have prices yet point wise on what they're gonna be but

45:31.200 --> 45:35.880
February 15th is when those four games are gonna drop and all that goes down and also

45:35.880 --> 45:42.320
there's a part of this for Windows 7 mobile operating systems for the Windows 7 phones

45:42.320 --> 45:47.020
the smartphones that Windows put out and except for everyone has either an iPhone or an Android

45:47.020 --> 45:51.220
so whatever there's also a bunch of games coming out for that as well but you know if

45:51.220 --> 45:57.020
you're also among one of those people that plays games for Windows live somebody anybody

45:57.020 --> 46:01.580
yeah I still have game room on games for Windows live I don't remember last time I touched

46:01.580 --> 46:08.700

46:08.700 --> 46:16.620
party starts February 15th of those four games in is there any by for get one free if I all

46:16.620 --> 46:23.300
for those games gets $100 I checked a few sites including major Nelson's blog post and

46:23.300 --> 46:28.420
now doesn't really seem that way this one's supposed to be geared more towards teenagers

46:28.420 --> 46:34.900
and stuff because hensir edgy commercial that they had in there edgy edgy being that there's

46:34.900 --> 46:39.140
teenagers having a house party you know it is because you know everybody has a house

46:39.140 --> 46:43.440
party I'm sorry grab the liquor and we're gonna play Xbox Live arcade your house party

46:43.440 --> 46:48.660
is invalid with like no no your house party is invalid without kid and play let's be real

46:48.660 --> 46:53.160
that is true if you if you want a house party Microsoft if you want a house party people

46:53.160 --> 46:56.700
are going to pay attention to you need to find out whatever the fuck happened to kid

46:56.700 --> 47:03.060
and play I'm sure one of them is not dead but one of them's got to be alive somewhere

47:03.060 --> 47:07.380
and desperate for money I'm going to Wikipedia right now I want to know what happened to

47:07.380 --> 47:12.860
kid and play they do have also there's a game from Double Fine coming out for the Kinect

47:12.860 --> 47:16.460
that's like I don't remember the fuck they're calling it but it's just a bunch of little

47:16.460 --> 47:22.660
Kinect mini games for you know from Double Fine but uh it almost reminds me a lot of

47:22.660 --> 47:28.620
that was at the connect where the free shit that they put out fun labs it's like that

47:28.620 --> 47:35.740
but paid on June 23 2010 kid and play appeared on Lopez tonight and performed rollin with

47:35.740 --> 47:42.000
kid and play from their album to hype at a 2010 Tribeca Film Festival kid stated that

47:42.000 --> 47:50.900
play and I also have a television series in the works so the future is bright watch that

47:50.900 --> 47:55.300
how fucking older kid and play now let me look at this up here kid kid was born in 64

47:55.300 --> 48:03.980
so he's 47 yeah I bet he could still get down also in Xbox news the Microsoft has released

48:03.980 --> 48:10.940
the sales numbers which they haven't done since since October and it sounds like 66

48:10.940 --> 48:15.900
million units sold worldwide as of this press release they put out and by units they mean

48:15.900 --> 48:23.780
stolen Xbox 11 the last time they enough half of them were sold in Poland and we can't figure

48:23.780 --> 48:32.060
out why then that's roughly 10 million more than the 55 56 million they said that they

48:32.060 --> 48:38.120
had sold worldwide at the end of October so 10 million over one holiday season the Kinect

48:38.120 --> 48:42.940
now is at 18 million units which I don't know what the numbers are for the move but I'm

48:42.940 --> 48:47.340
pretty sure it's not 18 million well they you can never really get accurate numbers

48:47.340 --> 48:53.160
of the move because they count every single accessory you know they sell you the the starter

48:53.160 --> 48:59.740
kit oh look we've sold you like you know three move units or four move units number of Kinect

48:59.740 --> 49:08.580
games worth it for those 18 million people to it's growing so it's it's slowed down obviously

49:08.580 --> 49:14.300
it's plateaued since the insane launch week the Kinect had but 18 million units is a very

49:14.300 --> 49:19.900
respectable number also they've come out and said that live accounts that are in service

49:19.900 --> 49:23.460
which means that people just configured a live account they log into it not necessarily

49:23.460 --> 49:31.280
gold but live accounts is nearly 40 million users which is about 60% of the worldwide

49:31.280 --> 49:37.100
sold so 60% of Xbox users have live in some capacity even if it's not gold they're not

49:37.100 --> 49:40.620
given them they're not they're not paying for it now where's the number about how many

49:40.620 --> 49:45.780
of those accounts are still uncompromised because that's what I'd like to know anyhow

49:45.780 --> 49:51.500
so as far as those 40 million silver versus gold it doesn't say but 60% pretty reasonable

49:51.500 --> 49:55.340
I think well here's the thing though the numbers are a little skewed there because they they

49:55.340 --> 49:58.700
give you the number of live accounts and the number of units sold but how many of those

49:58.700 --> 50:05.900
units have died true see that that percentage can be way high that percentage is way higher

50:05.900 --> 50:12.340
it's and that's a fact because you know pretty much all the launch units are dead so I don't

50:12.340 --> 50:18.340
know that it's interesting vidpower actually links a article he found that's related saying

50:18.340 --> 50:23.580
that as part of the house party promotion if you buy all four games you will get 800

50:23.580 --> 50:29.900
Microsoft points free which is like what a quarter of a FIFA gold pack so I see what

50:29.900 --> 50:39.820
you think 20% there you go all right moving on Loki so of course there was rumors that

50:39.820 --> 50:46.860
oh the new systems PlayStation and Xbox are going to be at e3 well it's too soon at least

50:46.860 --> 50:55.220
for the PlayStation according to Kazurai PlayStation 4 it will not be at e3 they have no plans

50:55.220 --> 51:04.100
on bringing it out at e3 and it says you know we're not making announcements at e3 I do

51:04.100 --> 51:08.300
want to just say I told you so last week on the show but to be fair pretty much everybody

51:08.300 --> 51:11.260
was thinking that this would be the case it didn't it didn't take a Miss Cleo to figure

51:11.260 --> 51:15.020
that out that there was not going to be a PlayStation 4 at this next e3 I think what

51:15.020 --> 51:20.780
it's going to be I think it'll be at least a year after and honestly I mean I know that

51:20.780 --> 51:23.700
they're kind of like okay whoever's first out of the gate is going to have the best

51:23.700 --> 51:28.760
chances as far as it goes I think that Nintendo is going to be stumbling out the gate to be

51:28.760 --> 51:33.860
honest and I don't think they're really going to have to play much catch-up and besides

51:33.860 --> 51:37.680
give it another year and they can copy whatever works well in Nintendo's system I could sort

51:37.680 --> 51:42.780
of see Microsoft announcing a new console but they don't have to like because you're

51:42.780 --> 51:48.700
right I think they can give Nintendo a chance to eat dirt a little bit maybe but Microsoft

51:48.700 --> 51:51.940
you know especially after the story that Alan just read about that the sales numbers are

51:51.940 --> 51:59.020
still good Microsoft still if they could get those like one or two killer connect games

51:59.020 --> 52:02.180
you know and I'm talking something better than that Star Wars thing that still isn't

52:02.180 --> 52:06.140
out you know if they could get those one or two killer connect titles that even the hardcore

52:06.140 --> 52:09.820
gamers like must have I think they're gonna have it now here's here's a real question

52:09.820 --> 52:14.980
about Sony and I think this this is a much better question so if you want to play games

52:14.980 --> 52:20.500
analyst for a minute those of you listening here's a real question for you how much emphasis

52:20.500 --> 52:25.300
will still be on the Sony move this year I think that's a real question asked about E3

52:25.300 --> 52:30.780
is that will Sony give up just like maybe they did on the plot well I guess the PlayStation

52:30.780 --> 52:34.900
I kind of turned into the move but you know will PlayStation decide to give up on the

52:34.900 --> 52:37.900
move a little bit now that they're gonna have the Vita out and maybe we'll focus on that

52:37.900 --> 52:42.160
a little more or are they really still gonna push the move it's an alternative to the connect

52:42.160 --> 52:48.180
and to the Wii that's that's a question for you I I think well they've kind of succeeded

52:48.180 --> 52:54.620
in a few avenues there one they've got better integration with the their motion control

52:54.620 --> 53:01.660
stuff into their hard their core games then Microsoft does I mean because hands down you

53:01.660 --> 53:08.060
know the move for like resistance and killzone and SOCOM and stuff like that it actually

53:08.060 --> 53:13.700
seems like it would work versus voice commands to throw grenade in Halo which seems very

53:13.700 --> 53:19.180
tacked on and not very tacked on it is tacked on there were the tacked on crap that they

53:19.180 --> 53:26.180
had in fours of four it's just and I have a feeling that even when they do decide to

53:26.180 --> 53:31.580
do a core well I don't really know if you can consider a lot of the Kinect games core

53:31.580 --> 53:34.700
stuff but the new fable game that's going to be coming out I don't think it's going

53:34.700 --> 53:39.620
to be any good okay I have to go to chat room with this comment um Kaiju don't our chatroom

53:39.620 --> 53:45.180
says Microsoft needs a new system that thing is dead with all due respect did you not hear

53:45.180 --> 53:50.740
what Alan just said like about the sales figures and dude I get what you're saying like I'd

53:50.740 --> 53:54.580
like as you know especially after the whole hack crap you know how I feel about the Xbox

53:54.580 --> 53:58.740
and I get what you're saying but I think Microsoft let me kind of give you an analogy Microsoft

53:58.740 --> 54:04.020
is right now especially with the Kinect sitting kind of where Nintendo was about three years

54:04.020 --> 54:10.380
ago where the core gamers like yourself and some of us were taking them so seriously yet

54:10.380 --> 54:14.660
they were still slaying with sales figures because the families were adopting them and

54:14.660 --> 54:18.860
I think that's kind of where connect is right now like maybe they're losing a lot of core

54:18.860 --> 54:23.420
gamers but they're still selling systems and you can't call it dead because they're losing

54:23.420 --> 54:28.220
core gamers at all I mean in fact I think that the next working well I did to be fair

54:28.220 --> 54:34.380
I don't think they are either but I think the PlayStation 3 is gaining a lot of ground

54:34.380 --> 54:38.860
I think it's not that the Xbox is running away with core gamers but I think a lot of

54:38.860 --> 54:44.780
core gamers are now looking at the PlayStation 3 going huh maybe I want one of those I don't

54:44.780 --> 54:49.940
know just you know in talking to people you know that don't play games as much I hear

54:49.940 --> 54:53.700
a lot of well I think I'd rather get a PlayStation 3 coming out of them here's the problem is

54:53.700 --> 54:58.220
that they have their whole demographic split in half now the people that really you know

54:58.220 --> 55:02.020
are kind of into the casual stuff that are buying the connect and then they have their

55:02.020 --> 55:05.660
you know kind of core gamers they're playing you know their franchises and stuff that they

55:05.660 --> 55:11.300
keep putting up and they've tried to get people excited they're playing core games to buy

55:11.300 --> 55:17.780
the connect you know with Forza 4 stuff and with Halo but honestly it's just such a poor

55:17.780 --> 55:22.140
attempt at you know tacking that stuff on that's not really accomplishing what they're

55:22.140 --> 55:27.020
hoping to accomplish they're trying to get people to kind of delve into both you know

55:27.020 --> 55:31.740
categories they want the core gamers to buy the connect games and they also want the people

55:31.740 --> 55:36.840
to play just the connect games and the casual stuff like the Just Dance and whatnot to play

55:36.840 --> 55:41.540
more of their you know Halo and stuff like that so they can you know expand the amount

55:41.540 --> 55:46.540
of sales that they have it's just it's not working right now because there's what they've

55:46.540 --> 55:54.460
done for these core games to implement you know connect functionality is really cheap

55:54.460 --> 55:58.620
and it shows I guess going back to the original question about the PlayStation move I guess

55:58.620 --> 56:03.800
you will always have those games that are ported to the move from the connect I mean

56:03.800 --> 56:06.740
even though the two technologies are kind of different like certainly get the games

56:06.740 --> 56:11.860
like Just Dance that they adapt for both I think it's doing well though yeah I think

56:11.860 --> 56:17.620
so so all right anyhow let's move on talking about other releases and things coming out

56:17.620 --> 56:21.660
another fighting game is going to be repackaged with all the download content and you might

56:21.660 --> 56:27.820
have heard it is Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat complete edition of course complete with AK

56:27.820 --> 56:33.220
is coming out all over again it is going to have the original game all of the DLC packs

56:33.220 --> 56:38.580
so including Freddy it's going to have Mortal Kombat songs inspired by the Warriors is that

56:38.580 --> 56:45.460
that old ass CD it might be did it or it might be the new one I don't know they have like

56:45.460 --> 56:51.980
a new soundtrack but if it's that old CD that's awesome I don't know also you get a download

56:51.980 --> 56:58.460
code of the 1995 Mortal Kombat film which you know was was decent for a video game movie

56:58.460 --> 57:01.940
because a lot of them aren't very good but the original Mortal Kombat movie was kind

57:01.940 --> 57:08.860
of all right and then the sequel was bad it was bad is really bad show was even worse

57:08.860 --> 57:12.260
was there ever a third movie there was talk about a third movie but they just never did

57:12.260 --> 57:16.100
it I think they're still doing it all right it's not a little late now well maybe now

57:16.100 --> 57:20.700
that the whole resurgence I guess there was a YouTube videos that really weren't they

57:20.700 --> 57:27.180
weren't bad so anyhow it is coming out on February 28th the Mortal Kombat complete edition

57:27.180 --> 57:32.400
both on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 so if you're like me and you never downloaded any

57:32.400 --> 57:38.700
of the DLC this may be a value to you I don't know I probably won't get it I don't need

57:38.700 --> 57:44.300
the 1995 film that bad and the DLC if I want it I can probably download do you like renting

57:44.300 --> 57:50.820
stuff do you I mean seriously do you guys like renting stuff because because Warner

57:50.820 --> 57:54.380
Brothers says fuck you because they don't like people that rent shit they're gonna push

57:54.380 --> 58:01.340
the window out to 56 days and also I wonder if there's going to be the online pass for

58:01.340 --> 58:07.140
listeners that don't know explain the 36 day window basically Warner Brothers right now

58:07.140 --> 58:14.380
they had implemented a 28 day window to basically block anybody that rents movies from you know

58:14.380 --> 58:20.660
buying directly from them if they want to buy stuff to put in their store they go out

58:20.660 --> 58:27.340
to Walmart or retailer Amazon or wherever and buy them and put them on well technically

58:27.340 --> 58:33.700
they they could sell you the product directly later on but you know it's now it's a 56 day

58:33.700 --> 58:43.100
window and so Netflix is not gonna have it until 56 days later and but red box you know

58:43.100 --> 58:48.660
they're like well fuck it we're just gonna go buy it you know at the store and as is

58:48.660 --> 58:53.980
blockbuster blockbusters if those are the big three that were kind of affected by and

58:53.980 --> 58:59.580
also you know you may like your Harry Potter well as of last year at the end of the last

58:59.580 --> 59:03.460
year they're all out of circulation now if they're they took all the movies out of circulation

59:03.460 --> 59:08.380
so they can go re-release them like Disney does basically Warner hates people fucking

59:08.380 --> 59:12.180
3d they're gonna release all the Harry Potter movies in 3d wait for it well it wasn't the

59:12.180 --> 59:17.300
last one already three Warner Brothers fucking hates they hate people that do not buy their

59:17.300 --> 59:22.540
movies they want to basically take everybody to out of rental to buy their stuff and to

59:22.540 --> 59:27.860
stream their stuff using their ultraviolet service is what they're looking to do so just

59:27.860 --> 59:32.220
saying which isn't gonna work because there's they're diluting it out there is all these

59:32.220 --> 59:36.260
all these companies think they can build their own Netflix it's not gonna work just saying

59:36.260 --> 59:41.260
you know if that's the kind of thing you want to support then you know by all means you

59:41.260 --> 59:45.900
know whatever you know what's fucking work it's Mortal Kombat if you haven't bought the

59:45.900 --> 59:51.660
game you mean I don't know just you don't really need all the DLC either I mean that's

59:51.660 --> 59:56.340
kind of cheap to sell characters like and Freddy Krueger coming come on and it's not

59:56.340 --> 01:00:01.020
even it's not even the Robert Englund Freddy Krueger it's yeah that that was a Jack girl

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.740
Haley a bit of a sadness Rama in our chat room says I remember when this shit was going

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:08.940
on with VHS movies video stores would get it before everybody else hold on Rama you're

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.780
talking about the reverse you're talking about the the total reverse what used to happen

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:17.180
then I used to work at a video store way back when movie those VHS tapes used to cost like

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:21.980
ninety nine dollars when they first came out that's why and so you know rental and sell

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.740
through they basically had rental rental movies would come out at one point then eventually

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.780
the studio would drop the price to sell there because I mean yeah you can go buy the movie

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:34.260
date the same day that it comes to the rental stores but it's gonna cost you a hundred dollars

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:40.980
or one hundred fifty dollars to buy that that movie but then they had program they're Warner's

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.540
tried a bunch of things they've tried distributing their own movies and that didn't work they

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:51.700
tried these programs and trust me working the distribution business it's fun all right

01:00:51.700 --> 01:01:00.020
let's move on Alan mad cats has released the latest line of the fight stick controllers

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:05.220
they're putting out for street for Capcom Street Fighter X Tekken they've done a redesign

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.180
of it there's two different models now the fight stick pro and the arcade fight stick

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:17.420
versus edition the latter which aside from having I think more detailed art on the top

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:24.140
panel of it is there is it comes with an accessory if you have two of them you can snap them

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:31.200
together and basically make a mock like arcade board where you have two people standing side

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.820
by side like they were fighting at a real arcade in clay in case you want it so she

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:39.300
want to sit a little closer to your friend yeah so if you can find a way to get like

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:43.580
a table and put this up up there you can then have two people for like for you know tournaments

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:51.700
that you want to host get you to buy two of them instead of one exactly and there's also

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:57.940
going to be a fight pad SD which is going to be 15 15 percent smaller roughly than the

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.900
previous fight pads that they've put out and that they don't have a price point or release

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:07.300
date yet for either of these products whether it be the new flight pad or the arcade sticks

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:16.100
but they are aiming for a to be congruence with the March 6th release of the game itself

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:21.640
and I have a little side story about this all right I remember in February of 09 when

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.780
Street Fighter 4 came out not super Street Fighter 4 but the original one I wanted one

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:32.180
of the fight pads mad cats and I have it right here Rob if you could hand that to me sure

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.660
I had to go on eBay to find this from one of the large like real like resellers with

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.260
the thousands and thousands of feedback score it was brand new in the clamshell that you

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:46.220
need a hacksaw to open I finally fit this is the only way I could get it they wasn't

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:51.220
at Target or Best Buy or GameStop or anything because of how limited quantities they were

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:57.820
completely dead out of the box PC won't recognize it and 360 won't recognize it and I paid so

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:03.900
much for this so whenever I hear that Capcom keeps giving mad cats their exclusive license

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:11.740
for the fight sticks then the arcade whatever I'm like mad cats products suck but that's

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:18.220
that's just it happens this stuff comes dead out of the box it can be anything I was gonna

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:22.540
say damn it I know it's gonna say Loki if you before I throw it out if you want to fuck

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:27.940
with it it's here if you want to take it home and open it I don't know but that's all Loki

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:36.100
fix it I know that master Loki read between the line take master Loki fix it he's worth

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.500
the thing look he's evaluating it well first off you're missing the part that the breakaway

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:47.220
part of the cable here oh yeah that's right anyway yeah just go to Kotaku or joystick

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:51.780
if you want to see what the fight sticks look like all right let's move on release stage

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.160
we're gonna travel the world and check out some upcoming releases coming soon to a game

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.020
store near you besides if he actually wants to play you know super Street Fighter well

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.540
name is super Street Fighter 4 but Street Fighter 4 in an arcade cabinet I've got an

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:09.140
arcade cabinet with super Street Fighter 4 on it with Japanese oh and and an octagonal

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:14.740
restrictor plate on my joysticks it's nice and collecting dust because I don't play on

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:23.260
it anymore not with the baby around anyways uh releases not a lot I hope you like Gran

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.980
Turismo and I hope they haven't bought Gran Turismo 5 because that's really that's all

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:32.820
coming out this week Gran Turismo 5 again yes Gran Turismo 5 XL Edition it includes

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:39.660
now this is kind of cool it includes all the well the spec 2.0 update and a voucher for

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:46.520
$20 worth of DLC and it's only 40 bucks okay that's cool so I mean it's not bad I am terrible

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.700
at like Gran Turismo and the realistic racers but that's that's a good deal that's yeah

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:58.020
I mean it's not bad and my pet puppy 3d for the 3ds from 505 games that is it my pet puppy

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.460
it's funny this week there was actually supposed to be games coming out but nothing came out

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.100
it wasn't dead week nothing wait what do you mean games are supposed to come out and then

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.580
they like a bunch of delayed stuff yeah there was two games they're supposed to come out

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:13.340
this week and both of them got delayed what games uh this week was supposed to be 41 action

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:18.060
packed from south peak or something like that there's a bunch of really terrible playstation

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:23.220
our games all right and then there was the National Geographic challenge which got delayed

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:27.500
to the 24th you know I'm thinking even if those games were coming out this week was

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:32.940
uneventful I'm just just saying just saying all right uh going to Japan oh real quick

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.620
though one release I wanted to say that's not on this list because it's a Xbox Live

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:44.460
thing DLC for Saints Row the third the first in the season pass it will be released this

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:51.220
week Genki Bull 7 which I am excited to play all right let's move to the Japanese release

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:55.100
dates which are a little more exciting on the Xbox 360 to start us off Dead Rising 2

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.540
gets a price reduction in Japan I think some folks may be excited about this Oni Chambara

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:04.580
Z Kagura comes out this week in Japan so I think this is like a sequel to the original

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:08.460
Oni Chambara which if you didn't know what that game was it's basically women with big

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:13.780
titties slaying zombies it is a woman wearing lingerie and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:20.900
killing zombies that's right how and how like in other words the formula for a perfect game

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:26.500
yet it doesn't end up on any end of the year best list it's not really kind of one of those

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.340
on paper it sounded awesome it's it's part of a simple series the simple series had a

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:36.580
really weird they had a lineup of games it was just so some of them were just like casual

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:40.720
games some of them were really weird Earth Defense Force was part of the simple series

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.380
in Japan on the PlayStation 2 this was also part of the series one that I wish that would

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:50.500
come over here or at least make a sequel to is zombies versus ambulance it's an ambulance

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:54.540
and you run over zombies with the ambulance nails another one it was like some chicks

01:06:54.540 --> 01:07:01.780
in maid dresses maids with like miniguns killing zombies a lot of zombie killing in you know

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.660
I like games that are over the top why can't we get more ridiculous why I thought Saints

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:11.260
Row was was really awesome actually all right also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week power

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:17.340
up heroes and Red Dead Redemption complete edition all those coming out on January 19th

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:21.720
heading on over to the PlayStation 3 some of the same stuff Dead Rising 2 Red Dead Redemption

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.100
complete edition getting the price reductions but there are some new things this week including

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:31.140
Nobunaga no Yabu Tendo that is actually again a price reduction as well as Trinity Zill

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:37.020
0 0 all of those games I just mentioned PlayStation 3 best hits next big release for Japan on

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:41.140
PlayStation 3 is probably Armored Core 5 but that's on the 26th so you still have a little

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.860
ways to go before that is out keep in mind the PlayStation Vita is already out in Japan

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:50.780
so they are getting this week Wipeout 2048 on the Vita makes its way to Japan this week

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:56.380
I believe that's a launch title for us over here the Wii really doesn't have a lot there's

01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:03.100
a price reduction of Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes and I'm quickly looking to see if the PSP

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:12.740
or no 3DS Labyrinth no Kannada and Rhythm Kaito R Kotei Napoleon no Isan comes out from

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:19.660
Sega this week trying to see if that's a rhythm thief I believe yes it is yeah rhythm thief

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:25.060
and the Emperor's treasure it's the Japanese version of that and what about 3D Drive Impossible

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:31.940
so kind of a bigger whoa whoa whoa hold on a second who's that from Rocket Company run

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:38.420
about 3D Drive Impossible yes runabouts fucking awesome I have not heard of this series runabout

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:43.580
it's been around since like the original PlayStation it came out over here as Felony 179 and it's

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.100
basically a game where you drive around and smash in the stuff with your car and cause

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.220
damage oh yeah I can see that from the screenshots it looks like you can drive a tank in one

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:57.300
of them oh that's a pretty fun game interesting to try that I want to give another second

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.060
thought very cool Yuki in our chat room says I thought it was a Dreamcast game of course

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.980
that could be I know it was that could be a delay Yuki might be commenting on another

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:10.340
game runabout was also a Dreamcast game I believe as well it was Dreamcast and PlayStation

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:16.660
1 maybe PlayStation 2 it was really simple looking graphic well it comes back in 3D this

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:23.000
week no it's PlayStation 1 for sure yeah all right let's move on with the UK releases two

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.980
games all right Wednesday the 18th we're going to get Haunt for the 360 and Scary Girl for

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:34.300
the 360 which are download titles so download titles yeah boring week over there in the

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.780
UK hope you enjoy what you got already and scary girl I guess is a graphic novel tie-in

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:45.100
and it's a Squeenix produced game it's a fighting game I believe if I'm not mistaken um Haunt

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:49.500
is a not my own shot game the folks that made Parappa the Rappa don't expect it to be a

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:56.540
music game yeah it's not a music game I thought scary girl was a fighting game but there there

01:09:56.540 --> 01:10:00.940
was some other fighting game that was coming out that was like that it might not been scary

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.700
girl I don't remember all right a couple more news stories for you guys than the classic

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.060
game of the week I know dark soccer is not here tonight but we still gotta have a classic

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.220
game of the week so we'll get to that in just a moment Loki all right let's talk about Kid

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:16.820
Icarus uprising first off of course you know the circle pad pro will be coming out here

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:21.020
pretty soon and the Kid Icarus is going to be supporting that as well they're going to

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:27.360
be getting a left-handed mode with the circle pad pro um which looks kind of awkward I don't

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.780
know how that would be holding that for the record now I'm really pissed off that circle

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:36.540
pad pro thing is a GameStop exclusive because Alan's left-handed he could actually use that

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:40.620
and you know because I'll probably buy that game and he could kind of use that mode but

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.940
I'm not going to GameStop period uh I don't know if he would be able to because like I

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.780
said the the circle pad is off-centered so the system is you know kind of hanging towards

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:55.300
the left side so holding it's going to be really awkward it's going to be heavy but

01:10:55.300 --> 01:11:00.900
that might not be a problem because apparently the you know playing on the 3DS is very awkward

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:05.900
and hard on your hands anyway so they're going to be coming or they're going to be coming

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:12.660
out with a stand or uh if you will for the 3DS that will be included with Kid Icarus

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.900
operating because apparently the game is so uncomfortable to play on the 3DS it requires

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:22.380
a stand making it not really a portable system anymore but uh yes apparently touching the

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:29.320
screen works better if it's secured according to Nintendo that's kind of weird weird to

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:34.420
bundle a peripheral like that with Kid Icarus that just to me that screams design flaw right

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:39.300
there yeah it's like we have to be getting a new 3DS here's what it is it's because you

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:44.900
know you have to touch the screen or whatever and it just doesn't work I mean if you played

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:52.780
even Metroid Prime 3D Hunters or whatever it was on the original DS kind of had that

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.900
same type of setup where you would move with the directional pad and you use your right

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:01.560
hand with as you with the stylus to kind of look around and it was fucking uncomfortable

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.800
to play that game so this kind of the same thing but now you use an analog stick instead

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.580
um it would be easier if you could aim like if you have the circle pad pro aim with the

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:16.980
right analog and move with the left and then you wouldn't need the touch screen but then

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:22.580
what's the point now Alan you've um had your share of challenges with the 3DS what do you

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:30.020
think about some of this news if you get it I'll use it I don't know you're just not that

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:36.260
excited about the 3DS to begin with pretty much I want when they release the second generation

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:41.780
of the hardware I will give a shit but I'm a late adopter on purpose I mean Nintendo I mean even

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:47.300
just like I'm holding my 3DS right now with one hand um you know kind of moving the analog stick

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:52.260
even just holding it for a few seconds is uncomfortable and pushing on the screen as

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:57.700
well as I'm trying to it really starts to put a kink in my wrist there I would think they would

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:04.260
have to I don't know they'd have to come up with some better way of doing that Mario Kart is the

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:08.260
bigger is the biggest culprit because you have to hold down the accelerator and that makes my hand

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:14.500
cramp really bad after like one track other games on the 3DS or like the one though the purely

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:19.740
stylus based ones are fine but I will bet you anything the next 3DS we get is going to be an

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:24.900
XL because the problem right now is everyone's saying it's too small I mean cramps people's

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.980
hands up that they're gonna make it bigger so they can put the extra analog stick on there and

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:40.380
it'll be an Excel system I will bet you all right well moving on speaking of Mario Kart sort of an

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:47.980
interesting new game hit the iPhone iOS I touch and all that store this week it's called mole

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:54.940
cart and you know it's it's it's kind of common these days that you see these iOS games that are

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:58.860
similar to games that are out there in fact you might remember last week we were talking about

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:05.340
kind of the same subject with Atari going after all these people well Nintendo may want to consider

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:11.180
going after this game because what makes it unique is that while they don't use Mario and that a lot

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:18.980
of the characters are different a lot of the tracks are lifted right out of Mario Kart a lot

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:25.180
of them all of them all of them are taken right from Mario Kart like the whole bouncy mushroom

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:30.540
race thing that was huge on the Wii is in there I mean you know you played this look I haven't even

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:38.460
bothered to play it but you actually got it yeah and I got it yeah and bought it and yes it's a

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:44.380
complete ripoff of Mario Kart the thing though see I don't like once again I don't like kart racers

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:51.660
on the iPod because I just don't like tilt controls it really pisses me off but even I

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:57.860
mean look at even the main screen here we have a complete ripoff of the bomb on and the corner

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:03.780
there item mode they call it so yeah they break it up there you start off with two characters you

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.300
can unlock two more by playing the game and you can buy two more on top of that and of course you

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:17.100
get mole man and some bear so anyways the different things that they have starting off

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:23.220
you have the mole pasture which I want to say it's one of the tracks from the Wii game I don't

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:29.780
remember it's but basically they've replaced just some of the stuff in there and then X mushroom

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:38.860
which it's definitely one of the tracks from the game the then you can unlock the fridge a port

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:45.460
which is it's definitely one of the tracks from the Wii game volcano which is one of the old

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:52.060
classic tracks the Bowser castle tracks from the Super Nintendo game that they remade the 3d and

01:15:52.060 --> 01:16:02.340
the Wii version that's in there sky remnant is another track the I think you can buy and then

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:11.140
Arctic glaciers and one of is the the ice track from Nintendo 64 version that was up rezzed and

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:15.340
then moles garden was peaches I think it's peaches garden or something like that or daisies garden

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:20.700
so in other words it's a damn ripoff yeah they'll all everything's a ripoff so rather than being

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:26.740
just it's the same genre cuz last week you were saying that companies go after third-party things

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:30.740
that say oh you're you're copying our game but it's like no it's just the same John right copy

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:35.900
the tracks the tracks are the same so this would be a valid lawsuit yes this be all the power-ups

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:40.700
are you know oh this is not quite a bullet bill it's something different but all the power-ups

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:44.700
are the same I mean they have all the power-ups but doesn't the quality of stuff like this kind

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:51.300
of speak for itself it's not bad I mean it's interesting all right I mean you can take a look

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:56.780
at it orange right in our charm says they just released a Smurfs village ripoff called moles

01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:02.900
world how the hell do I play this I mean it's automatic acceleration you have a break and then

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:08.660
you till I'll move I just moved backwards should I hold your mic up to your face for you okay hold

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:15.780
the air sure I'm playing this any type basic how do I how do I use a little question yeah you tap

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:25.220
the item to okay I just got a flaming pair as a power-up and there's cows standing in the middle

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:29.060
of the course just like on the wee one and the flame pairs I'm assuming are like the mushroom

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:35.060
yeah because they gave me a little turbo boost and I can't drive for shit this game I mean it's

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:39.500
one of those things where it's like I would show my friends haha look at this Mario Kart ripoff but

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:46.340
I mean is it really worth what is this a pineapple okay it's an oh it's the it's the use it all you

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:55.780
want nitro the frame rate on this sucks Moo Moo Meadows yes Moo Moo Meadows it's even on the

01:17:55.780 --> 01:18:07.180
fucking banner it says Moo Moo Meadows on the fucking banner you know I'm thinking the developers

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:13.500
kind of forgot that you might want to change some things that are on the track way to go can I turn

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:18.060
that I'll turn that off it's too nose I'm pressing the button shutting it off right speaking it's

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.580
making Rob angry angry because I've actually been playing Mario Kart 7 and I'm like at least that

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:27.860
game has a decent frame rate yeah Moo Moo Meadows is uh I believe it is one of the tracks where did

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.940
I do it do and when you come up to the it's from our car we it's on the banner it says Moo Moo

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:41.060
Meadows like idiots ah that's that's that's fantastic because you know you know they're

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:46.960
doing it in some you know very tiny cubicle high production supervisor glaring down everyone's

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:53.180
next environment where they just got it's it's just take this track and copy it you know just

01:18:53.180 --> 01:19:03.160
bit by bit detail by detail and so they copied it that's fantastic good job all right let's take a

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.220
moment to take a trek down memory lane remember remember when the only game that was getting

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:14.700
ripped off with Street Fighter 2 fighting street let's take a trip down memory lane remember in

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:20.780
the groove all right every week dark soccer likes to dive into the vault and pick a game that she

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:25.620
thinks is worthy of being the classic game of the week but she's not here so instead of the classic

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:31.680
gaming vault we have the classic gaming cardboard box and Alan has dived in thumb first into the

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:37.260
classic gaming box and pulled out a game that he thinks hey show some respect this is a true

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:43.100
classic right here Alan what is the classic game of the week this week this week's classic game is

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:50.420
the original half-life I'm so released 1998 I'm so surprised at this coming from you yes I know

01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:55.780
that's right yeah it's never been a classic game of the week and reality check this game is what

01:19:55.780 --> 01:20:04.780
yeah 13 years old at this point yes yeah half-life was made by two former Microsoft employees Mike

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:13.140
Harrington and Gabe Newell whose name might ring a few bells they bought a the package to modify

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:18.740
the quake engine and they hacked the shit out of it to design this game and by the time they were

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:24.940
done the quake engine had grown into something called gold source which is how source which was

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:30.340
the big engine that half-life 2 and left 4 dead is based off of that's how they got that name so

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:36.140
the original half-life was a modified a quake engine game it was published by believe it or

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:41.620
not Sierra entertainment or what Sierra online had become before it finally closed after you

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:46.380
know that after they made all the King's Quest and Space Quest games so yeah developed by valve

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:52.380
you know a little company you might have heard of published by Sierra online and it was released

01:20:52.380 --> 01:21:01.620
November 19th of 1998 on the windows PC platform and of course anyone who remembers the 90s know

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:07.540
that as far as first-person shooters go there were the two big titles Wolfenstein 3d which set

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:14.980
the place for doom which at the place for Duke Nukem 3d what half-life did differently and how

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:22.540
how it got so much critical acclaim was the storytelling which was done through the map

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:30.460
while you were playing also it was a continuous like doom and hexen and Duke Nukem 3d there was

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:34.340
a there was a final checkpoint of the stage where you have to hit the button or go through the door

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:39.860
and it says you have completed here's the par time here's your time yeah half-life was just like a

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:45.680
big I mean it just kept going and going there were a little chapter marks so when you got to a

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:51.340
certain plot point in the game and you uncovered a new area a subtitle would say you know chapter

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:55.860
two office complex so you know that you're progressing through the story but other than

01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:04.020
that it was like a big ant farm you were in Black Mesa which was a military industrial private firm

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:13.460
that made like nuclear weapons for the government in Arizona and you play Gordon Freeman a physicist

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:19.780
who is doing an experiment on some alien moon rock that is given to him in strange circumstances and

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:26.660
when he does a test on it a dimensional rip from an alien world hostile alien world opens in all

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:33.740
these aliens pour out and it turns out that they were working on portal technology like game portal

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:41.780
which came much later and while developing this portal stuff they accidentally tapped into an

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:51.780
evil alien overworld and critters showed up and oh no it was critters yeah it's one of the best

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:59.020
rated first-person shooters of all time I think it's got a 97 or 98 on Metacritic the other big

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:06.660
thing which was unprecedented at the time was that the marine soldiers that come in and like in

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:12.540
chapter four or five to kill you it they actually had an AI believe it or not because the demons in

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:18.060
doom and the aliens in Duke Nukem 3d were pretty dumb you know you you could hide behind cover you

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:25.260
just run out and shoot them in half-life if you duck for cover the computer would know to tell

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:30.420
the the NPCs to then throw a grenade and the aiming on the grenade was accurate so you'd be

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:35.940
hiding behind a box or around a corner and you would see a grenade it's like oh shit and no one

01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:42.180
had ever played a game that hard before where you had to actually think about how to go about

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.900
killing your enemies half-life was also very different where there wasn't really multiplayer

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:53.820
which was really big in that day or was there like co-op I don't there it came later there was um

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:59.740
there was half-life deathmatch and also counter strike which is the biggest that was the that's

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:05.580
also a hack of the gold source engine but when valve opened up the game as it was released did

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:09.700
not have your quake style multiplayer your Duke Nukem 3d correct that's kind of interest that

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:14.420
came later it was still so successful without that component I mean granted it came later and

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:17.980
now you have also you know valve is very well known for that stuff but it wasn't a part of

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:24.140
the original game and the opening of half-life is Gordon Freeman getting into the tram to go

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:29.540
it's in the morning he's going to his day at work and it's you don't really get to control your

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:34.500
character at all it's about a two or three minute intro where you're just on this tram going through

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:39.620
the Black Mesa facility and what it's kind of doing is showing you the game like this is what

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:44.100
you're going to be dealing with once shit goes down there's a part where you kind of are crawling

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:50.140
through the Grand Canyon and skilling all these cliffs and you'll see the sewers and then finally

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:54.700
the tram stops and it lets you out and a first-person shooter had never really tried to

01:24:54.700 --> 01:25:00.620
do storytelling in that way before the designer of Bioshock if you remember the intro of Bioshock

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:06.060
where you the plane crash lands and you're in the water and you go into the lighthouse and you're

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:12.220
in the bathysphere and you see rapture the city that is inspired by the tram sequence in half-life

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:19.100
they've just said that it's exactly a direct homage to what half-life did there were a few

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:23.100
flaws of course with half-life and there were a lot of bullshit weapons in it that you never

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:29.500
use they're like 15 different weapons you only needed like five of them way too long especially

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:35.100
since the last chapter of the game you actually you go to the alien world to kill the big brain

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:44.260
fetus that part was really ugly and it had a lot of first-person platform we have to jump on shed

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:49.820
or else you fall off and die even today in 2012 you put jumping puzzles in a first-person shooter

01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:54.180
people like fuck now this is stupid I don't want to do this half-life near the end of that of its

01:25:54.180 --> 01:26:03.700
cycle had a ton of that stuff so it wasn't without its flaws I believe it's also one of the as far

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:09.860
as PC exclusive shooters the best-selling this made along this may not be true any longer but

01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:15.060
there was a point where if you bought a new sound card you got a copy a free copy of half-life you

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:19.740
bought a graphics card or a new computer like you got a circuit CD you get the package deal well now

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:25.540
it's download game and half-life will cost 50 cents at some point yeah so an absurd amount of

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:34.900
millions of units sold of this game and half-life 2 of course came out in 2004 launched the steam

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:39.700
store platform which of course no one knew at the time what the fuck that was and now steam is

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:46.700
totally integral to PC gaming and without any of this we would have never had portal yeah or portal

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:53.220
to our game of the year this yeah aperture science which is the main company and portal is hinted at

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:58.460
as being in bidding wars with the government against Black Mesa and always losing so they're

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:03.220
kind of like the shitty little kid brother of Black Mesa anything else you say about half-life

01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:09.020
it's awesome I do a full playthrough of it at least once or twice a year it's hard as hell I

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:14.700
can't honestly beat it without using a god mode code for at least some parts of it but it's

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:19.180
definitely awesome and if you like first-person shooters you want to know you want to know what

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:25.300
all the hype is about when people lose their shit about where is half-life 3 god damn it play this

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:31.500
and figure out okay I can see why I want more of this but do keep in mind the game is you know 12

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:37.580
years old at this point yes so but there's been newer versions you know there's a fan community

01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:44.740
project it's pretty much vaporware called Black Mesa source which was it's not related to valve

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:50.260
at all but the valve is absolutely given it it's given them their blessing a complete reskin of

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:57.980
half-life with completely redrawn textures like a total remake of it that hasn't come out yet and

01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:03.600
it's been planned for like five or six years all right well that's gonna do it for our classic game

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:11.780
of the week this week half-life released originally in 98 for the PC get your crowbars all right all

kid and play who haven't been around since what the 90s but apparently they are still there one

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:11.260
thing I wanted to mention at the top of the segment here in part B an announcement of sorts

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:16.020
that we're gonna make tonight is you might remember one thing we're pimping and pimping

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:20.860
and pimping here on the show towards the end of the year last year was home loud which of course

01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:26.700
is a fundraiser that happens in the Bay Area San Francisco which is a fundraiser for the child's

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:33.940
play charity which made well let's let's be real a shit ton of money this year for a good cause it

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:37.500
seems like it's doubling every year which is amazing I think the final tally was somewhere

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:42.740
around like $26,000 I might be misquoting that a little bit I don't have the number in front of me

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:46.500
but it made a great amount of money for charity which is awesome well the reason why I bring it

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:52.500
up again is because the official pre-show which I was asked to be a part of and I'm very thankful

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:57.860
I was a part of that is now posted up on YouTube for everybody to check out so I will paste the

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:02.620
link in chat there for you guys if you haven't already seen it because I know it was out on the

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:07.020
umlaut Facebook and stuff earlier or for those of you guys listening on the podcast just just head

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:14.100

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:18.900
as they've gone ahead and they've kind of cropped every band performance out so that the band folks

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:23.060
can share it with their friends and all that so everything right from the comfort of your own

01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:28.260
home they're from umlaut I do ask if you are gonna watch the hour and a half long pre-show

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:35.500
for about the first 20 minutes just skip all the segments have me until about about 20 minutes in

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.340
because unfortunately there was some audio snafu and I think I have a Jessica Simpson moment but

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:45.500
you know what it's live things like that happen we've had our share of lol wtf moments here on

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:49.820
orange lounge radio like remember when the entire sound board fell over that was a good time so

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:53.860
anyhow big thanks once again to umlaut for asking me to be a part of that including of course the

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:58.820
wonderful seg who I think is in our chat room I saw him there earlier hello seg and the other guys

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:04.240
that put the pre-show together the whole folks of the AV society very professional folks and my

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:11.740
fellow co-hosts on that show carnage and Wes both from destructoid were great and did very well with

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:17.820
all the interviews and everything so lots and lots of interviews and folks okay so again that's

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:23.140
YouTube user umlaut SF and by the way you can still donate so you can still if you forgot if

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:27.460
you're like oops I meant to donate but you know it was December was a rough month well you can

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:31.740
still donate so I don't think it'll go to this year's tally but it will go to a good cause and

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:36.460
that's the very important part all right let's move on with some rapid-fire news some other game

01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:43.300
news going on there this week Loki yes so let's start things off talking a little bit about Saints

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:47.260
Row the third this is kind of cool this is something that I know I heard about a while ago

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:54.620
it was announced by chief s gamer because involves cheap ED but cheap ED is gonna be in Saints Row

01:31:54.620 --> 01:32:03.100
the third as a homie that you can actually get to back up your your gang member in missions which is

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:08.420
kind of cool you can actually download him as either part of gank people sevens DLC which is

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:15.060
gonna cost you seven bucks or free if you happen to you know have the season pass or you can get

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:21.740
it for free using the gank people seven viewer pack which allows you to get all the DLC portions

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:30.220
to be able to play co-op with someone that has that DLC if you choose not to buy it and of course

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.580
the only catch is that you need to get to the point in the game where you're at the first save

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:39.020
house which you know doesn't take that long because that's when you homies but uh even I'm

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:43.180
at that point yeah I mean if I could play that long if a game can hold my attention that long

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:47.100
you can do it it's pretty awesome and he does have a bunch of unique lines apparently in the

01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:52.580
game we got popcorn over here would you like popcorn it's plain popcorn though it's that's

01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:58.340
fine it's gross it's pretty bad popcorn right I eat low fat or the low butter popcorn sometimes

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:04.860
of course I couldn't find that the source I have regular butter now haha all right oh well it is

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:09.740
playing yeah apparently it's all the hell out of that what I heard about cheap ED I think he won

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:15.140
some type of auction thing and oh yeah maybe yeah it was like a charity thing I knew about that

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:23.620
auction I would have paid like $2,000 or something to do it so um I don't know if it made the news

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:27.040
tonight because I think it might be kind of late-breaking and I really apologize I'm like

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:32.660
scanning over the upcoming stories there's rumors going around about thq that apparently they're in

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:37.380
trouble right now and they're selling off or something about all of the projects coming out

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:42.020
in 2014 for thq have been cancelled and I think they're trying to prepare the company to be sold

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:48.100
I don't think they're in trouble mm-hmm pretty good I mean where does a rumor like that come

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:54.060
from industry insider well I know that but like who would make something like that up that's a

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:59.820
weird rumor to make up well it's still ways off I mean 2014 I mean I don't know maybe they're just

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:09.740
who they bought by I mean EA or Activision who else who else buys up gaming companies all right

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:14.500
anyway I'm sorry because I don't see them like kind of going that way right now because I mean

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:20.820
how other companies have worse I have a worse time than they do I mean sometimes you get surprised

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:26.580
PopCap why did PopCap sell they were doing great I mean you look at Capcom Capcom didn't do that

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:31.940
great I mean they have Street Fighter Marvel vs. Capcom but I don't think that would sold tons I

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:38.540
mean they really have any big games and I mean Warner Brothers had Batman so that helped but

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:45.620
they didn't have bad you know Harry Potter and Lego Harry Potter yeah I don't think so all right

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:54.580
let's move on all right and some other cool stuff Dark Souls there's hopefully chance that it'll be

01:34:54.580 --> 01:35:04.460
coming to PC and of course the admin for the Dark Souls game they responded to a request for a PC

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:09.580
version and basically said there's always a possibility to have games adapted on PC and the

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:15.860
good news is Dark Souls is not a 100% typical console game so the option is possible now to

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:22.100
make things happen let's say the demand has to be properly done someone make a successful petition

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:29.700
and so there is a petition right now you can sign it it has currently around 37,000 signatures and

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:38.180
if it hit some arbitrary number then maybe they'll be a Dark Souls PC game which would be kind of

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:47.140
neat and last but not least Silent Hill Silent Hill it was supposed to be coming out earlier

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:54.100
in 2011 of course downpour has been delayed to March and that is where you're gonna be able to

01:35:54.100 --> 01:36:00.580
find a lot of Silent Hill games this year Silent Hill downpour of course coming out on March 13th

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:10.100
I'm sorry March yeah March 13th and then the HD collection will be coming out on March 6th and

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:16.060
then on the Vita a book of memories will be coming out March 27th so it's a whole month

01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:25.100
full of Silent Hill whether that be a good or bad thing all right we talked a little bit about

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:30.220
Silent Hill already earlier in the show what another movie to another movie but I mean

01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:35.780
they announced it wasn't terrible the first one it was alright I really like the first movie yeah

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:44.540
it's good just man the games that last game that they put out was not very good and this one I'm

01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:50.380
not sure if it's gonna be very good either and I don't know if was it frozen memories was not the

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:55.980
one of the Wii I don't know if that was any good either hmm it was a lot of running all right

01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:02.460
moving on this isn't necessarily about video gaming but it's about a game that like influences

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:07.460
a lot of shit in video gaming and that is Dungeons & Dragons and there's some big news this week

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.820
about Dungeons & Dragons it's a little bit controversial Wizards of the Coast is working

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:16.500
on a new edition of Dungeons & Dragons which is kind of weird to me in a way like it seems like

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.580
they're they're pumping these out faster than versions of Google Chrome all of a sudden like

01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:25.820
wasn't the original version of D&D in the 70s and then they had one in the 80s or like no

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:32.060
wouldn't second edition was all the way in the there was D&D and then there was a D&D okay and

01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:35.980
then they consolidated those two brands so they're kind of what there was a tricky other version in

01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:41.020
there yeah okay so whatever but it seems like you know it goes at least every seven years but we how

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.380
long ago is fourth edition fourth edition was just a few years ago right cuz I remember all

01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:48.580
the comparisons to World of Warcraft yeah well apparently they're working on another one which

01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:52.820
you don't find that's that's fair and you know D&D always has room to evolve and get better and

01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:59.820
so forth but the fifth edition of the game is apparently seeking user input quote we seek to

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:05.980
build a foundation for the long-term health and growth of D&D one rooted in the vital traits that

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:09.940
make D&D unique and special we want a game that rises above differences of play styles campaign

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:13.460
settings and additions one that takes the fundamental essence of D&D and brings us to the

01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:17.940
forefront of the game in short we want a game that is as simple or as complex as you please

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:23.340
it's action focused on combat intrigue and exploration as you desire we want a game that

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:28.420
is unmistakably D&D but one that can easily become your D&D the game that you want to run and play

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:32.460
that is from their official announcement that they sent out earlier this week and they say by

01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:38.220
involving you in the process we can build a set of D&D rules that incorporate the wants and desires

01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:43.620
of D&D gamers around the world so they are going to I guess at least are claiming that they're

01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:48.020
going to be user input in a lot of features of this game wasn't there supposed to be a lot of

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:55.820
user input Mega Man Legends 3 2 and look where that got womp womp no but I'm not you know

01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:00.660
obviously D&D is a classic game but gonna be very interesting to see what direction it gets taken

01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:06.900
in I mean you would think the people that play it regularly would would know a lot but sometimes I

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:12.540
don't know like I go to World of Warcraft which obviously heavily influenced by D&D right World

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:19.580
of Warcraft almost listened too much to its vocal fan base in this latest one like Cataclysm really

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:23.540
kind of catered to a lot of the very vocal people and because of that it's the weakest expansion

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.340
and then suddenly everyone hates this expansion including those vocal people so I'm just saying I

01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:34.820
know it's a little you know weird to say on the show where every gamer has a voice but you gotta

01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:38.300
you gotta balance it I mean there's still some decisions you're gonna have to make with that

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:44.500
that's why they're fans and not game developers yeah so all right spazinator says my input D&D

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:49.900
needs more T&A I don't know what circles you're playing in but you might want to I'm sure there's

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:55.980
plenty of people that will be games had planned T&A I mean there's I can't tell you how many

01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:04.180
times we went all the problems on the roll for whatever exactly I want to get drunk if there's

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:11.500
any chicks there I want to do them all right also the Simpsons arcade game is coming to Xbox 360 and

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:17.380
we absolutely know this now because some of the achievements have leaked to the Xbox 360

01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:23.300
achievements org website one of them is called mr. sparkle and what's interesting about that is

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:29.900
that the components of the mr. sparkle achievement say from stage one make it to stage three bosses

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:36.780
in survival mode within the Japanese ROM so that is spoiling of sorts the fact that in this Simpsons

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:41.740
arcade game that's gonna come out on 360 you're gonna be able to play the original or us I guess

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:47.580
ROM but you also get to play the Japanese ROM apparently the Japanese ROM has lower difficulty

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:54.140
more health items more points and the ability to jump while holding a weapon very interesting so

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:59.780
that's gonna be in that release and lastly kind of some rumors going around this is big big rumors

01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:05.260
but apparently retro studios which is one of the big nintendo developers right what a retro studios

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:12.980
do did they did they do that on okay Donkey Kong they have made a hire from uncharted 3 developer

01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:19.180
naughty dog and apparently somebody from Darksiders staff so they're bringing in some folks from the

01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:26.580
UM you know big releases over there Eric Kozlowski who used to be with naughty dog has said that this

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:30.940
new project is well let me just read the quote here quote I'm going to work on another project

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:35.940
that I am super excited about I can't talk about it too much but if all goes well it might just be

01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:42.700
one of my crowning achievements as an artist it's another Zelda game you think yeah because they've

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:51.660
already you know they you know put for some effort into making stuff for Mario Kart and I think that

01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:56.900
they were you know they've been commented about saying no hey we'd love to get our hands on Zelda

01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:02.780
I think it's a Zelda like spin-off or something like that new like type of Zelda game well Zelda

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:07.820
or not it could be very interesting to see what this is because this could be that big announcement

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:13.480
at e3 like here is what the core gamer is gonna want to Wii U for yeah but see here's the thing

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:19.820
though remember when they said the same thing about Metroid other M how did that do it just

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:29.060
like tanked I mean so I don't know why the other M wasn't terrible it tanked it take no no I don't

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:33.300
any wrong yeah game itself wasn't no it's not terrible that's the problem though there's a lot

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:38.500
of not terrible games that come out and they're pretty decent like you know mad world or even

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:47.260
uh conduit or you know some of the other ones out there and killer and not killer seven but no more

01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:53.420
heroes those are not terrible games but they don't sell and fuck if you can't sell a Metroid game on

01:42:53.420 --> 01:43:00.700
them on a Nintendo system you got problems all right let's move on with some more rapid-fire

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:08.220
news Allen for those who remember the XCOM franchise from the 90s the company named for

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:13.420
axis I do showed up at e3 last year saying that they were gonna bring back the franchise I

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:18.700
completely missed the XCOM train when I was in junior high in high school well if you ever won

01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:22.720
I had the entire XCOM collection I bought on Steam for like four bucks which has like five

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:28.540
XCOM games they were pretty awesome I just old ones were they got really old ones were so they've

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:36.100
we haven't seen much about the FPS version of the XCOM game under or rather under the XCOM license

01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:42.060
that for axis is bringing back and that's because that it's being pushed to 2013 has been canceled

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:46.980
I guess maybe they're having problems imagining how XCOM would function as an FPS but they're

01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:53.300
still developing it they just need more time however the XCOM strategy reboot which I guess

01:43:53.300 --> 01:44:00.140
is more here here's more to what XCOM originally was is still on board for a 2012 release they've

01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:07.620
also renamed the game to XCOM forever go figure okay this has it here is XCOM enemy unknown so

01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:12.740
it's like Duke Nukem forever I'm trolling I'm tired it was like a low flying jet over my head

01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:26.180
it was a bad Joe is bad going over me also so next quick fire story is there's a game that was put

01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:31.980
on Kickstarter which is like I have a great idea and please fund my project I only need five grand

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:38.860
and me and my friend will design this and blah blah blah a game called Oregon Trail not Oregon

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:46.740
the state but Oregon like a kidney Oregon Trail director's cut a success on Kickstarter so it's

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:51.300
going to be a zombie filled spoof of the Oregon Trail where I guess you've got a map and you're

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:56.020
trying to survive getting from point A to point B destination where of course the big stronghold

01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:02.660
is that is keeping the zombies out and they they met their Kickstarter goal so hopefully that will

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:09.660
be developed and released and I want to have a grand old time and this image here it looks like

01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:14.020
they've got some pixelated Sean from Sean of the Dead and some of the characters from Zombieland

01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:21.260
and sort of a apple to ease sort of the color graphics that Oregon Trail had good times yeah

01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:29.700
so yay for Kickstarter and indie games last story I have is that there is a unofficial patchwork

01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:41.020
GLaDOS GPS voice sound pack that's awesome turn left you moron and it looks like the files should

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:46.820
work with the Garmin mobile XT units I was thinking maybe it might be TomTom because they're the huge

01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:54.500
sort of standalone GPS because they have a ton of voices like you get a James Earl Jones and Samuel

01:45:54.500 --> 01:46:03.340
Jackson yeah this yeah this here had lists yes there is a Samuel Jackson motherfucker can you

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:15.060
do it seriously that is it there's mr. T there it's got to be a macho man savage one I don't know

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:23.740
go straight six miles oh yeah let's see destination on the left boy no I know they have like a Darth

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:30.300
Vader one Tom Tom voices let's see here Wow you know I kind of need a GPS here you go here you go

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:37.100
Marge Simpson that's one of the newest ones that they're highlighting now I kind of want a GPS that

01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:43.460
might be kind of fun Homer Simpson Roger Moore Kim Cattrall kit Kim Cattrall Kim Cattrall fuck

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:49.260
would you want Kim Cattrall doing your Yoda like it's just her howling from Porky's even my mother

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:57.060
would be like the fuck is this Yoda Han Solo SpongeBob SquarePants C3po Yosemite Sam Bugs Bunny

01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:08.380
Dora the Explorer Darth Vader where some of the other funny ones here the fuck is that man I don't

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:15.180
understand I don't even know Burt Reynolds I've heard the Burt Reynolds one Billy Connolly Dennis

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:21.820
Hopper all right anyway Dennis Hopper has been dead how long if you have a Garmin mobile xt I

01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:26.420
guess any of them there's a whole line of them go under reddit and look this up because it's a it

01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:31.140
was posted to reddit I guess it's reddit people that piece this together but yeah GLaDOS in your

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:37.260
car telling you how to get to Walmart Daria some of the folks in our chat room Rama says GLaDOS

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:45.420
is already on TomTom so I guess this is some new thing so whatever all right that still sounds kind

01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:51.740
of awesome to me all right let's move on Loki I'll stop looking at voices um of all these dead

01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:57.300
celebrities and can there are a lot of dead people on there and some people that should be dead

01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:06.740
you're mean but anyways uh CES they showed off a few things obviously a lot of TVs including some

01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:15.260
new smart TVs or web-enabled TVs that have a guy time and on life support guy kind of course coming

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:22.180
to some brand new LG TVs and you'll be able to stream games straight to the TV using the

01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:32.380
interface on there also coming to Google TVs would be on live service and I'm guessing they'll allow

01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:39.740
you to purchase the universal controller and stream stuff straight to the TV which you have

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:48.100
to use their player app for that no word on what other devices maybe you know the stuff will be

01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:53.340
coming to but it's kind of neat that someday you'll be able to get TVs that stream games

01:48:53.340 --> 01:49:01.580
straight to them and I mean if you think about it you know really these consoles if you will

01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:08.300
will never go away because they just keep updating the hardware on their end and they can keep

01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:13.460
running all the new games you never have to buy a new console again well tilt the resolution it's

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:17.940
really better it's very interesting this is a very interesting direction having the consoles

01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:22.420
directly built into the TVs essentially I mean I realize these are kind of different still kind of

01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:27.300
growing things but how long before Microsoft puts out their own TV with a built-in Xbox and connect

01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:32.020
is right in the top of the TV on these two little cameras well even on top of I could see that in

01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:37.700
the next three years all the console manufacturers go you know streaming then you don't need to buy

01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:41.580
the console you can play you can play Twisted Metal and then you can play Fable you can play

01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:49.780
you know resistance and dead central I mean it's all on one thing could be very interesting and

01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:54.660
then well I think they've already said that the major developers at least Sony I don't know if

01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:59.580
they've said got a quote from Microsoft but are committed to still doing like a disk based or

01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:05.540
physical media based format just because you know especially with 250 gigabyte caps still in most

01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:13.140
homes like there's no way to you know download entire games you know and all that is still kind

01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:19.780
of a ways away before these huge epic you know games that fill a blu-ray we really download

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:25.460
right into our homes all the time you know what I mean so I think the next generation of games

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:30.340
still gonna have a physical base format but you know two generations from now this is what we

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:34.260
could be looking at I think a lot of people thought we would be a download only at this

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:43.220
point but as far as Gaikai and on live are concerned I guess we are so would this would

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:47.380
this would this be a feature that would interest you in a TV at all guys or is this just and

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:55.460
whatever it's more and whatever for me I mean it's a neat it's neat technology for sure Alan

01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:01.780
you might be in the market for a new TV soon is this something we should look to get yeah yeah

01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:10.340
all right well moving on something that may be built in that you don't want so much I don't know

01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:16.580
we'll see but Mass Effect 3 of course is coming out on PC as well as the various consoles but

01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:24.980
Mass Effect 3 on the PC it will require origin it will not work on Steam as you know EA and

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:30.340
valve are in a little bit of a quarrel right now Alan you look like you're dying to comment

01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:36.180
on that situation yeah they're having a wang contest they're yeah get out the ruler boys

01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:44.260
what does it all boil down to the fact that EA is not only are they a publisher and developer

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:50.500
like valve is but they are also a medium of commerce distribution so now we have two storefronts

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:56.820
like I don't know target and Walmart or Macy's and pennies that offer the same thing and then

01:51:56.820 --> 01:52:01.940
they're just having a cockfight over well here's distribution here's how EA puts it in their press

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:07.380
release quote during initial release Mass Effect 3 will be available on origin and a number of

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:12.500
other third-party digital retailers but not on Steam at this time Steam has adopted a set of

01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:16.820
restrictive terms of service which limit how developers interact with customers to deliver

01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:21.780
patches and other downloadable content we are intent on providing Mass Effect to players with

01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:25.700
the best possible experience no matter where they purchase or play their game and are happy to

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.620
partner with any download service that does not restrict our ability to connect directly with our

01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:34.740
consumers and I believe it's the whole fact that when you have a game on Steam patches come through

01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:41.060
Steam and EA doesn't want that also this happened Dragon Age 2 which I mentioned during my gaming

01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:46.020
week that I'm playing I had to install origins to get da2 digitally it was on Steam for a couple

01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:51.220
months this was a big story like last year and it was on Steam and they took it down because valve

01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:57.460
and Steam had a problem with how EA handled the DLC basically what it means is if you buy a game

01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:02.900
on Steam valve wants you to be able to buy DLC for it through through the game itself like you

01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:09.940
load the game and then through the game interface you can buy DLC or buy the DLC a la carte via

01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:18.180
Steam with Dragon Age 2 you had to go to EA's website so valve wasn't doing the transaction

01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:23.540
like you weren't actually doing the credit card transaction through valve or through Steam and

01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:28.740
they didn't like that so that's what got da2 kicked off of Steam so now EA is basically

01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:32.740
saying we are making the game and we have a store so you have to buy it through our store

01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:36.820
well now they are swearing up and down but even if you don't buy it in the origin store you have

01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:40.900
to install origin that's that's another big thing that's what half-life 2 did that's true that's

01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:46.180
true but here you go now they are saying they're swearing origins not spyware quote origin is not

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:51.780
spyware and does not use or install spyware on users machines in order to allow origin to install

01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:57.220
games and their patches for everyone to use origin implements a permission change that results in

01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:02.580
windows not origin reviewing the file names in the program data origin folder this is an ordinary

01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:07.300
windows function not an information gathering process so basically they're trying to say we

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:12.500
swear we're not spying on you we just want to get our store on your computer now to be fair

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:17.060
as alan mentioned this is what valve did several years ago and it pissed people off then to

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:21.140
activate your cd key and your license for half-life 2 the biggest sequel of the year at

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:26.580
the time in 2004 you had to install this bullshitty steam store what the fuck is this i just want to

01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:32.500
play half-life 2 and um of course the servers were overwhelmed at the time because it was

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.140
unprecedented but yeah now i hope i'm saying this uh name right in our chat room but it's aham kara

01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:42.740
and our term says steam is better and i have more games there already so they win end of story origin

01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:46.980
can suck it and i think that's the way a lot of people kind of feel right now is that it's like

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:52.260
i don't want another store i this is very similar to what loki was talking about probably an hour

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:56.740
ago with the whole uh movie stuff right at the top of the show with that whole like fact that warner

01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.780
brothers wants to force people to use ultraviolet and i'm like people don't want that they don't

01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:08.900
want one store focused on one company and it's it just the consumer is gonna lose in this because

01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.100
there's gonna be all these different stores it's like i don't want all these now here's the thing

01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:20.340
though is people they think that people are either gonna buy it at retail or wait 56 days to watch it

01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:25.940
they're not gonna like want to rent it or they're gonna stream it via their service or they'll

01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:33.060
pirate or they'll pirate it that they will pirate it that's what's gonna happen i mean and for those

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:38.100
wondering if they have mass effect one and two digital delectations which were available and

01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:42.900
is still available via steam if they can import your save games because the plot is continuous

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:46.500
through the third because it's a trilogy the whole story is going to wrap up with mass effect 3

01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:52.020
yes of course if you have the previous two games even through steam it will sniff your save game

01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:56.260
file and mass effect 3 will continue with the choices your character has made your version of

01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:03.060
shepherd so again and if you know if ea doesn't want steam to sell it then it's it's not you know

01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:06.980
there it's not going to be on steam if you really if this origin thing pisses you off

01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:13.460
even if you go to best buy and buy a hard box copy of it at a store real store it's going to

01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:19.380
put origin on your system there's no way to get around this unless you go to a crack site but to

01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:26.020
be fair exactly what half-life 2 did yeah six or seven years ago yeah so but there were also cracked

01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:32.580
versions of half-life 2 that's true yeah that's what's going to happen here yeah so all these

01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:37.700
companies think they know what gamers want gamers want to be left the fuck alone that's what a lot

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:43.460
of gamers want anyhow all right we're going to take a moment to uh you know we say it's the show

01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.380

01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:25.220

01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:34.740
um now what the hell we only have two emails tonight right what the hell so the backstory

01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:39.700
about this before i jump into the email and if you have a problem with this just don't be an ass in

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:44.980
chat because jamie would probably kick you and i would kick you too in her place so that's how i'm

01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:55.380
going to step up and be dark skirt tonight um the girl scouts allow transgender girls into their into

01:57:55.380 --> 01:58:01.140
a certain chapter and if the parents present them as a girl and you know they they go by a girl name

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:05.540
they can be in the girl scouts even though they were born biologically something else there's a

01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:10.580
huge um there's a right wing you know people within the girl scouts that have a huge problem

01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:18.580
with this and they're asking that people not buy girl scout cookies until these children are thrown

01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:22.500
out just so you know alan i think our listeners are pretty smart yeah and that they're nobody's

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:29.300
gonna have a problem i i know but it's just we all think that bitch is crazy yeah so so now people

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:34.580
who are supportive of the transgender kids or girls being in the girl scouts are hearing about

01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:38.500
this boycott boycott and they're like i fucking want to buy cookies because this sounds awesome

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:44.580
it's you know it's it's access to you know different different types of people um so here's

01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:50.340
the email after all that backstory uh dear persone after reading dark secura's tumblr post about the

01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:55.860
girl scout boy girl scout cookie boycott i did what i usually do in response to these kinds to

01:58:55.860 --> 01:59:00.900
these kind of right wing protests i sought out a way to do the exact opposite of what those i

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:06.740
completely disagree with tell me not to do being antisocial and not having nieces who are currently

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:12.340
girl scouts i searched to see if i could buy scroll girl scout cookies online however i was

01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:18.020
not able to find any in fact according to the link at the end of this email girl scouts of america

01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:23.300
does not allow their cookies to be sold online my question is why there are a great number of

01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:28.100
shut-ins that are yearning for the kind of awesome samoan goodness that are not possible that they

01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:34.340
cannot possibly get on any samoan porn site these people have loads of excess income that can be

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:39.540
easily spent on fundraisers that fund the instilling freedom and independence into the mind

01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:44.180
of young girls across this great land without programs such as the ones done by the girl scouts

01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:49.540
of america more women may become shut-ins like the men that could the men that could potentially

01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:57.220
fund the gsa i urge everyone to i urge everyone to urge the girl scouts of america to allow the

01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:01.940
sale of girl scout cookies online i don't know how to do that for i am too busy playing skyrim

02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:08.740
stay black uh redertainment um here's the thing i think the reason why they don't want you to buy

02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:13.380
them online is keep in mind that you know the whole stuff they're trying to teach in the girl

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:18.420
scouts i think is part of the whole like going out and you know they want the girls to be able to you

02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:23.060
know get out in the community and sell them and i think you know even though you make the case i

02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:28.180
don't want to leave my house the problem is they want the girl scouts to leave the house to do it

02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:34.180
it's to teach the the scouts customer service and how to count money and how to run a budget and

02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:39.300
blah blah blah exactly so for that i mean you don't have the girls in a factory doing all this

02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:42.340
i mean maybe i don't know but you know they're not going to learn as much from that i think it's

02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:46.180
about being out there in the community being visible that's why they're out in the grocery

02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:50.340
stores and things like that because you know redertainment at some point you're gonna have

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:54.580
to get out of the house and go get groceries i mean well then again and they're usually parked

02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:59.060
out at Safeway well now like amazon and some Safeway and some shit will deliver the groceries

02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:03.540
to you so maybe not i don't know but there's gonna come a point in your life where even that's not

02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:10.020
gonna work it's gonna be like i need to get something i ran out of you know and the delivery

02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:14.260
service isn't working and you will run into a little girl scout who will be smiling and if

02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:19.940
would you like to buy a girl scout cookie if they open up online ordering oh god damn case oh god

02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:27.460
damn case oh god because they only make a certain amount a year because you know they give the boxes

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:33.220
to whatever the chapters are in each state they go out to the little suburbs they would have to

02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:36.900
make a shitload more cookies and they would have to do fulfillment and how to ship it and pricing

02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:40.820
and blah blah blah so it's it's really just about the scouts going out into the community and

02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:45.140
selling cookies and that's i don't think that's going to change but it'd be nice but if they

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:50.900
sold them online there'd be no point in setting up the little tables and irritating you you know so

02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:57.700
i mean but to be irritating you when i always buy the girl scout cookies because like you know when

02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:01.300
i you know for me usually it's kind of like you know i'll be walking in stores and girl scouts

02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:05.460
are here and like would you like to buy girl scout cookies i'm like fucking yeah yeah i'll

02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:11.700

02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:25.140

into the geek community have no concept of what it is or what it means what's worse is because the

02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:21.700
media wants wants it in the news what's worse is because the media wants it in the news networks

02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:27.220
are not bringing it to the forefront i wouldn't wait until the 23rd but do it on the 20th to allow

02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:33.300
for the desired backlash against the bill to build this would also be too big of a story for the major

02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:40.340
news outlets to ignore what gets me the most is the congressman pushing it it is extremely dismissive

02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:45.940
of the critics including internet and security experts including vincent surf it seems he doesn't

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:50.820
care because the big media filling his coffers wants it and the heck with representing his

02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:55.700
constituents or observing the constitution think about that next time you're at the ballot box

02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:01.300
all very good points obviously there's been a lot of changes with SOPA just like over the weekend and

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:06.100
um it's coming up on our show a little later so um if you haven't already heard i'll kind of clarify

02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:12.020
some of the developments with SOPA long story short it sounds like we're being heard and that's

02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:17.540
a great thing all the way at the top we're being heard well so president obama put out a statement

02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:23.220
about it right yes which we'll cover a little later wink wink oh but you know he's been known

02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:28.340
to say one thing and then all of a sudden yeah yeah so but i mean yeah so it's it's kind of one

02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:33.940
of those we've won the battle but not won the war type of thing because you know then the MPAA put

02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:38.900
out this whole thing about you know well it's all these thieves are just trying to win and da da da

02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:44.340
da and it's kind of like take a chill pill the movie industry has been suffering not because

02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:49.380
of piracy but because the movies have been bad and that was uh take care signed wendy that was

02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:55.300
from wendy or the fact that you know what when it costs 51 dollars for three people to go see a

02:04:55.300 --> 02:05:03.700
movie that they could have rented at blockbuster for 250 you know it's like there's the problem

02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:09.380
hollywood get your head out of your butt anyhow we'll talk a little more about those SOPA updates

02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:15.300

disney 24 hours of disney and my clubbing days are over i don't do disco naps anymore

02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:42.900
when we started this show we were ranting about getting into our mid-20s now it's our mid-30s

02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:51.140
wah all right uh let's move on with some gaming news loki all right um let's talk a little bit

02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:57.300
about uh a witch hunt that was going on it's actually kind of funny because it was regarding

02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:03.940
uh witcher 2 and people pirating the game i remember back uh was a few months ago or so

02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:10.180
when uh cd projects said that they're going to be uh targeting pirates and they're going to be

02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:18.100
filing legal action against them and um you know eventually they penned an open letter to the gaming

02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:25.380
community where they you know said they're going to stop doing that and um you know apparently

02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:32.980
though there's no still saying you know piracy hurts them but uh you know i don't know i don't

02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:40.660
know why they stopped i'm guessing that they had less of you know uh good luck than uh they had

02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:45.620
hoped finding the people that stole the stuff from them i would say it's either bad pr or realized it

02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:49.620
was going to cost them too much money you know probably just one of those when they kind of

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:54.100
really thought about what they were doing they realized it wasn't cost effective or something

02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:58.900
you know i guess i'm kind of surprised they don't pursue one or two to make an example

02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:06.980
but i don't know maybe or maybe maybe just crazy thought here maybe it has something to do with

02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:12.100
they watched the whole internet backlash for go daddy i think a lot of people watched what

02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:17.220
happened with that whole thing where go daddy really got pressured by their customer to change

02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:22.740
their stance on soba and you know obviously they were wrong on soba and they should have

02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:28.500
turned around but i mean it was really money talks in that case and i bet a lot of tech companies are

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:33.620
looking at that going dude don't piss off the internet i mean after all it's they're they're

02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:38.100
the ones giving us money uh here's the actual reason why they stopped it says all right um

02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:43.380
basically it says our fans have always remained have been remain our great greatest concern and

02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:48.020
we pride ourselves on the fact that you all know that we listen to you and take your opinions to

02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:52.980
heart while we are confident that no one who legally owns one of our games has been required

02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:58.100
to compensate us for copyright infringement we value our fans our supporters and our community

02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:04.260
too highly to take the chance that we might even falsely accuse even one individual so apparently

02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:10.260
there's foolproof way of change of heart well you know and in a way you know what if the whole

02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:14.980
thing went to trial and so forth and then it doesn't go their way i mean maybe they're really

02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:21.460
afraid of that so i mean that could be part of it too so yeah all right anyhow uh moving on to

02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:27.620
video games saving lives you know we've unfortunately had a report a lot of times on

02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:32.900
the show about you know dumbass murders their friend over an xbox game but very rarely do you

02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:38.020
hear the stories about how video games save people's lives and you'll never guess what game

02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:43.620
was credited with saving a life i know this is this is a stretch but it's making the rounds and

02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:50.100
we should talk about it words with friends is a very popular ios it's fucking scrabble like i know

02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:54.340
they they're not allowed to say it's scrabble it's great but it's fucking scrabble okay words of

02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:59.140
friends is fucking scrabble on the iphone it's words with friends is like bull cart

02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:05.620
and scrabble is like mario kart although they actually remember to change

02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:11.780
moo moo farm on the banner like they would change the board and words of friends but anyway

02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:16.740
one of the deal about words with friends is that you could uh actually chat you can chat with

02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:20.500
people that you're playing with and i actually have friends that will play i don't like words

02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:25.140
with friends personally i just i you know why i don't like words with friends because it's too

02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:30.420
easy to cheat it is way too easy because it's not a live game and i've been tempted to do this just

02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:34.900
go to go on google and find an anagram finder go on anagram.net or whatever it is and it's even

02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:40.100
easier than that and yeah seriously now they have apps where you take a screen print of your words

02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:43.940
with friends and then you run it through the app and it tells you here's the best play i mean it's

02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:50.900
like now i could play with people that i know wouldn't cheat but like i just if i have the

02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:56.100
alerts on my fucking phone goes off at 2 30 in the morning with some of my you know some of my

02:12:56.100 --> 02:12:59.140
friends stay up later they're on different coasts or whatever so one of my friends on the east coast

02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:03.220
will just be getting up for the day at 6 a.m and makes their work makes their play in words with

02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:09.940
friends and here i am fast asleep at 3 a.m that wakes me up more than it wakes you up i know

02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:15.780
right so words of friends can be very dangerous in that regard so if i play with alerts off though

02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:19.940
then i after about a week i'm like ah fuck it and then yeah i've already forgotten i think i have

02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:26.420
some like three moves i have to do right now and i just i yeah well anyway i've been dragging this

02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:31.140
out but long story short there was a random match played in word with friends with these you know

02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:36.100
two folks one of them was uh an australian and one of them was here in missouri and they just

02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:40.500
got randomly matched up but they were chatting with each other and i guess having a very nice

02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:46.900
conversation which is almost newsworthy in itself like asl everybody i chat with on the internet

02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:52.340
that's usually a stranger is usually a dumbass like no offense you guys i'm talking about the

02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:58.500
strangers like if i play random online games with strangers like uno or something like i get the

02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:05.060
biggest dumb fucks on the internet you know so i it's a miracle in one that civil people got

02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:11.780
together to play this game uh and then apparently uh this guy in australia simon fletcher was

02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:16.740
playing words with friends and he started complaining in the chat i've been having

02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:21.300
chest pains and whatever like i don't know like how does that even fucking come up in chat like

02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:30.420
you just played the word heartburn for 45 points sorry i'm replying so low i i'm i'm typing with

02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:35.300
one hand because my arm is having shooting i can't use my right arm right now because i'm

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:39.220
having shooting pain so how does that even come up in a random chat i don't know whatever but

02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:46.180
they've been talking about it and beth legler was the opponent uh and uh they were playing against

02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:51.780
beth i guess simon his wife were playing against beth and beth luckily was married to a doctor

02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:56.100
so kind of told the you know her husband about oh well this i've been playing with this guy

02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:02.020
in australia but he's telling me and the guy the doctor said you know what simon needs to

02:15:02.020 --> 02:15:07.780
go to a hospital immediately and sure enough when he finally went to the hospital he had a 99

02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:13.860
blockage near his heart so it was right to tell the guy to go to a hospital now i get with this

02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:18.180
whole like video game saving lives thing or whatever i think that part of it's obviously

02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:21.940
getting blown out of proportion just like low he was rolling his eyes at the beginning of the story

02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:26.900
this was more about guys being fucking stubborn when it comes to going to the doctor

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:33.060
it's really what let's be real how many of you are in a lot of you probably are guys

02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:36.820
those few ladies that are out there listening i know there's a few of you how many of you know

02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:39.620
guys that are too stubborn to go to the doctor because they don't want to admit something's

02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:42.980
wrong with them or they don't want to admit they're getting old or you know whatever it is

02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:50.180
i think this is more a fact that honey a doctor is telling me you need to go to the hospital

02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:58.020
you're gonna go to the fucking hospital i know someone whose dad had a minor incident and it

02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:02.260
turned out to be serious but he also hadn't set foot in a doctor's office in almost 30 years

02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:10.580
that's crazy so it's like and his attitude was you don't see doctors because nothing exists until

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:14.180
they find it and that's when you're sick so if you don't go to the doctor they won't find you

02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:19.060
you're in for i mean i realize some people avoid the doctor due to well not having insurance you

02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:23.460
know that's a whole nother oprah i'm not going to get into or they avoid the doctor maybe because

02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:29.460
of religious reasons i guess but for real if neither of those apply to you and you're just

02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:42.100
being fucking stubborn like go don't you want to be healthy all right anyhow so yay words with

02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:49.380
friends bringing people together this is the same this could have been about a 1997 aol chat room

02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:57.460
you know what i mean whatever all right moving on alan so ces just happened and usually that's a big

02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:05.460
electronics and hardware gadgetry uh uh event not so much for the gaming that's mostly saved

02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:10.340
of course for tokyo game show and e3 and all that however the biggest gaming related thing

02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:17.220
that came out of ces most likely is the project fiona gaming touchscreen tablet by a company

02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:23.300
called razor the e r a zer and i must admit looking at the pictures of this thing it looks

02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:33.060
like a very uh sexy device it looks well made it's sleek and um it's gonna run an intel ivy

02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:42.420
bridge core i7 processor it's going to have three axis tilt gyro functionality a magnet magnetometer

02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:48.340
accelerometer force feedback is going to vibrate dolby 7 surround sound with built-in wi-fi

02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:55.620
and bluetooth and razor ceo min liang tan explains we are looking to change the whole perception of

02:17:55.620 --> 02:18:01.140
tablets this first of its kind pc gaming tablet with integrated dual controllers is definitely

02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:06.980
not for playing casual games about unhappy birds or zombie killing flora throwing shade

02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:14.180
throwing shade at the iphone games yeah imagine a black ipad that's a little bit thicker and it has

02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:19.700
two um i don't want to say they look like wiimotes but they're they're bars that you

02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:23.860
hold in your hand like two playstation move navigation yeah just with that without the

02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:28.820
the glowy ball at the end yeah they're playstation controllers like the nunchuck of the move yeah

02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:35.700
um and again if i didn't mention this earlier it just it it's a portable pc it's it's not it's not

02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:40.820
its own proprietary platform like a playstation or 360 it's just it's for pc games you would install

02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:48.100
pc games on this and the price point is there say they want it to be below a thousand us but again

02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:55.860
there'll be 999.99 and this thing looks awesome and it's like all right it's pc gaming on a

02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:59.460
tablet and it's a touchscreen it's got all this cool shit but where's the market because if you

02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:03.860
have that kind of money to drop on something like this you can get a comp like a very competent

02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:10.820
gaming laptop that is a fucking laptop and you can do laptop shit on it that laptop you're using

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:19.140
right now i bought for 400 well over two years ago because i was with my ex at the time and so it was

02:19:19.140 --> 02:19:23.540
like probably about three years old and that cost me 400 that will run warcraft cataclysm on it

02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:30.020
yeah not low low settings but you can you can play on it yeah so i mean imagine what a thousand

02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:36.660
dollars now would get you you know and so the the display on it is 10.1 inches a diagonal viewable

02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:44.100
uh resolution is 1280 by 800 i'm gonna post a link of this into chat it looks like an awesome device

02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:48.980
it's great that they're trying to make this but where where's the market who's who's who is this

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:53.620
for i have to agree with this point that cinderwolf said in our chat room at chat orange laundry.com

02:19:53.620 --> 02:20:01.300
cinderwolf says did he just say 7.1 surround sound on a tablet like yeah they may be going

02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:06.660
or they may be going too far like maybe they don't really need that it's like and if you have a 7.1

02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:12.260
surround sound set up and it broadcasts the bluetooth via bluetooth to your fucking speakers

02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:18.580
then you're in your house and you have a computer play your games on that unless you've got you're

02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:22.900
like on amtrak you've got these backpacks like oh these are my speakers yo and you're setting

02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:27.860
them up i don't know you have like uber headphones that can emulate it really fucking well you know

02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:33.540
it might be a bit much yeah so the dolby 7.1 chip and firmware is in there at least but yeah exactly

02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:38.260
if you've got the speakers then you're probably in your house you can play on your desktop so

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:42.820
yeah i'm gonna it it looks like a hot little device but mom is always on the desktop playing

02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:47.940
words with friends with people in australia so maybe that's why i need a tablet it also sounds

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:53.540
like because this tablet is so streamlined that it's going to be able to churn out max

02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:59.940
settings graphics on this little tablet that a pc where you you always have to upgrade your graphics

02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:03.940
card every two years and it sounds like this is just a total monster visually on how it's

02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:08.740
going to render games but who's going to buy it loki is this something that interests you

02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:18.900
fuck no why not too damn expensive now i was trying to find out um they have um this this

02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:25.060
seriously makes me think like i'm surprised loki doesn't try to build his own version of this for

02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:31.780
half as much no no it it's don't get me wrong the what what's in it is pretty powerful it's got a

02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:38.420
core i7 inside of it and a bunch of other you know fancy shit and in the form factor is nice but it

02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:44.020
looks ridiculous i mean it's not portable at all it's as portable as a laptop is and honestly just

02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:49.300
buy a fucking laptop and a controller i mean it it's pretty much and the price point is just

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:53.620
ridiculous i was trying to find they remember they had this is the company that wanted to do

02:21:53.620 --> 02:22:00.020
that switchblade which was the m portable mo you know system that was going to revolutionize

02:22:00.020 --> 02:22:04.900
everything and then that kind of flopped and then they came out with this really fucking expensive

02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:11.060
um keyboard which i cannot find for life me but i swear that keyboard's like 300 bucks

02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:18.020
all i have to say though is that you know we're mere probably within a month of the next ipad

02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:23.060
announcement right that should come late january february if by some i mean we all know the next

02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:27.700
ipad has to fucking be high def has to right and the rumors are swelling and all that stuff it's

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:34.100
going to be more powerful if apple finally decides maybe now is the time to finally put

02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:39.780
some type of attachment on the ipad that gives tangible game controls this thing should not even

02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:45.780
bother coming out it's fucking dead already like like not to sound all apple fanboy but let's be

02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:53.060
real and with the tablet and the two you know move like sony move like gaming sticks i am interested

02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:58.260
in how those gaming sticks with the thumb you know thing translates mouse controls but what if

02:22:58.260 --> 02:23:03.460
you want to play a first person shooter you need the wasd and the keyboard and stuff so even then

02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:09.700
even now this tablet looks like it's gonna limit the experience of the pc games that a laptop or

02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:19.060
pc would give you so it's also 100 or it's also like a thousand dollars yeah i mean you can spend

02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:25.300
a thousand dollars on a laptop and get a nice laptop yeah all right well let's move on with

02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:30.100
a couple more news stories for you guys and then the twitter topics and the skype line at 1 877

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:34.500
game olr loki and also by the time it actually does come out there's going to be something

02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:40.980
better and cheaper i mean fuck there switchblade never came out that was shown in e3 i think last

02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:46.500
year or ces or some shit okay sorry um anyway so let's talk a little bit about successful

02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:53.220
franchises in one successful franchise which i'm just surprised every day and how successful it is

02:23:53.220 --> 02:24:01.700
just dance and just dance 3 sold 7 million um copies already worldwide and that's from october

02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:09.700
and of course um you know the series itself is moved 25 million units um i would definitely

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:17.300
say that the music franchise is not dead or at least just dances and dead so konami ddr

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:23.140
when have you moved 25 million units ever can i ask how 7 million units ever how does just dance

02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:29.300
3 compared to dance central 2 it's a different type of game dance central 2 is more of learning

02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:34.420
the actual like dance steps whereas just dance the whole just dance series is more mimicking you

02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:39.300
remember when you watched me play that abba game oh yeah we're laughing where you're holding the

02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:44.180
thing yeah that's imagine that to katy perry songs that's just dance i mean i what i meant

02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:51.940
what i meant was the uh this the units sold the sales oh yeah they're far and beyond dance central

02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:55.860
2 well yeah because dance central 2 is connect and everyone of course has a fucking wii so that

02:24:55.860 --> 02:25:01.460
makes sense yeah but i i want to say that i would be willing to bet that just dance 3 on the connect

02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:08.100
is probably outsold dance central 2 which i don't know i i i haven't played just dance 3

02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:14.980
specifically but dance central 2 is so good like it's kind of sad um i had to look up the numbers

02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:20.180
but yeah i'd be willing to bet that they they've probably beat them out all right well while you

02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:24.980
look that up don't interrupt me wait till i'm done with the story but uh i want to close out today

02:25:24.980 --> 02:25:30.180
before we get to the skype line with some more of those um updates on soap up obviously the stop

02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:35.940
online piracy act there has been and since that email was sent in and since last week's show there

02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:43.940
has been quite a bit of change going on with this and uh for one the um SOPA sponsor lamar smith

02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:49.940
came out uh and said he's going to pull the dns blocking provisions from the bill quote after the

02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:54.900
consultation with industry groups across the country i feel we should remove domain name

02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:59.300
system blocking from the stop online piracy act so that the committee can further examine the

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:03.060
issues surrounding this provision so you know that was obviously one of the big controversial

02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:08.180
things is the whole blocking of websites that getting taken out of the bill now also over the

02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:11.700
weekend the obama administration is pretty much has already been brought up earlier in the show

02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:16.660
but i had it listed here so whatever uh the obama administration basically came out against the

02:26:16.660 --> 02:26:22.260
bills in their current form saying in a nutshell i'd i you know i'm gonna really try my best to

02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:28.660
summarize this they support that foreign websites and piracy and all this needs to be stopped

02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:36.500
but not at the cost of censoring lawful activity and must not as they say in the release inhibit

02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:40.980
innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small so in other words they don't want to see

02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:47.700
sites get shut down by corporations because of you know flaw wording in this bill which is kind

02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:52.500
of where i think a lot of us are at you know i i can see that they need to do something about

02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:57.380
foreign website need to do something about fucking spam you know what i mean that shit is annoying

02:26:57.380 --> 02:27:00.740
but how do you stop it and i don't know if there's an easy answer i really don't think there's an

02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:07.220
easy answer to stopping that kind of stuff good filters on your email i this might sound a little

02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:14.420
weird yes good filters on your email but maybe we need like a new email 2.0 like maybe they need to

02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:18.580
upgrade the standards they use for emails that gives more accountability to the computers that

02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:23.780
send them maybe i i that's just kind of where i'm at like you know you can kind of spoof a lot of

02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:28.580
that now but maybe they need to change the system that uses encryption verification i don't i mean

02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:32.900
i guess any of that could get hacked by people but there's got to be something where there's

02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:36.900
more accountability from the original center and it's easier to track you know what i mean

02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:45.460
um okay so just dance and dance central 2 now dance central 2 has been out a lot less time well

02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:50.500
a few weeks less they've it's only been out 11 weeks whereas dance or just dance 3 has been out

02:27:50.500 --> 02:28:01.380
for 14 weeks just dance 3 is at 993 191 units um that's only in the us and dance central 2 is at

02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:09.060
930 858 units so they're slightly ahead but they've been out for three more weeks interesting

02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:14.340
okay well that's good to know although for me note this chart which was from last week

02:28:14.340 --> 02:28:21.220
uh dance central 2 is in the 17th spot whereas just dance 3 is in the 20th spot well that's good

02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:25.700
yeah well i mean again i mean i'm not i'm not hating on just dance 3 i mean it's a decent game

02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:30.740
but that's just that's straight on the 360 that's not all platforms okay all right let's uh let's

02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:34.020
open up the skype line it's that time we're going to open up the skype line now and take your calls

02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:40.020
at one eight seven seven game olr or as our username on skype is orange lounge radio all one

02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:44.100
word while we wait for those calls to come in because there is a little bit of a delay we have

02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:48.340
just a couple tweets tonight not a lot but um we do have a couple so let me get to some of those

02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:53.140
tweets right now i just want to make sure there wasn't anything earlier in the week that i missed

02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:59.860
here uh i guess not anything i'm catching off top my head i apologize i'm gonna be honest if you

02:28:59.860 --> 02:29:03.620
tweet us on sunday you have a much better chance of getting read than tweeting us on monday after

02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:08.100
the show because sometimes i lose those amongst there's we get a lot of spam tweets too i have to

02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:14.500
filter through anyway uh we'll start with a tweet from spazzinator on twitter tweets us and says

02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:21.380
will there be another marathon or fuck show anytime soon um fuck show no that was a that

02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:27.220
was a one-time thing that's done um a marathon show yes we've been talking about it we just

02:29:27.220 --> 02:29:30.580
don't know when tonight would have been a great night for that but just too much other stuff

02:29:30.580 --> 02:29:36.260
going on so it may not be until there's another long weekend which for me is a long weekend which

02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:40.820
for me isn't until memorial day do you get president's day off nope interesting see i

02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:44.020
don't get president's day off but i do get martin luther king day off i don't we don't get any of

02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:49.220
those interesting but you get memorial day right yes oh but we have we have other plans memorial

02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:56.020
day weekend most likely so sometime it is it is in our minds let me put it that way it's just

02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:59.700
you know again that whole thing i talked about earlier about only being able to stay up so late

02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:03.220
but i think it would be fun to do another like noon to midnight show if nothing else

02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:11.540
um so we'll see it's it's on our minds but just not in the next month or two all right uh let's

02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:16.580
see moving on to some other tweets uh tiger claw sends us a couple tweets i'll start with this one

02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:23.060
about the writer's guild uh announces a list of nominees for best writing in video games you know

02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:28.660
the wga they um also nominate movies and things like that but now they get into writing for video

02:30:28.660 --> 02:30:33.860
games after all a lot of video games are very movie-sized scripts these days right so um these

02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:42.100
games got nominated for best video game writing by the wga uh assassins creed revelations batman

02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:50.500
arkham city brink mortal combat strange but i guess it did have a story mode uh and uncharted

02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:57.460
three drake's deception uh those are the nominees from the wga um list needs more portal 2 in my

02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:03.300
opinion that's kind of a odd obviously missing game but uh yeah i mean still a lot of those

02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:09.380
games are very good and have very you know stories that suck you in so there you go again our skype

02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:14.980
line 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio if you'd like to go ahead

02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:22.660
and give us a call you can at any time all right one of the story from tiger claw whistleblower

02:31:22.660 --> 02:31:30.020
alleges unlawful practices at code masters hmm uh he links us to the story on shack news

02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:34.260
a former code masters employee has publicly accused the publisher of unlawful business

02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:40.260
practices uh a programmer semi assessy i hope i said that right oh was a programmer on the

02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:46.180
game body count says that code masters uh has threatened former staff with bankruptcy

02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:51.460
proceedings over a dispute regarding wages the company claims were mistakenly paid out

02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:56.020
uh he wrote this whole blog post about it saying that code masters frequently infringed on

02:31:56.020 --> 02:32:01.220
employees rights uh he had to work a left or he had to they failed to give workers 11 hours of

02:32:01.220 --> 02:32:06.740
rest in any 24-hour work period so in other words yet another slave driving game company story

02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:11.780

02:33:18.820 --> 02:33:25.620
and i was like really awful so um you know this game wasn't really on my radar but uh after

02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:32.020
playing it and um it was really fun i gotta i gotta admit was it easy to pick up because i know

02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:35.780
the problem with a lot of flight simulators is that i don't know how to fly a fucking plane and

02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:41.300
like it is a flight simulator and if you don't know the proper sequence to turn the plane on

02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:45.860
to get it to take off like you're not going anywhere in that game like or does does microsoft

02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:53.140
flight kind of simplify that yeah yes so what they did was they had a setup um on a pc but they had a

02:33:53.140 --> 02:34:00.580
xbox 360 controller connected to the pc and um one of the the developers was there and basically

02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:08.820
the he had these bunch of like challenges and it really using just like the xbox 360 controller

02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:15.780
it was really simplified controls and it makes flying a plane way easier hmm much easier than

02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:22.100
you know i thought it would be interesting but yeah that was it was really fun they had like

02:34:22.100 --> 02:34:28.500
really basic stuff like you know how to take off and how to land and they had some fun stuff like

02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:34.820
how to like collect all these like low like fly through rings and stuff things like that

02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:39.620
oh wasn't that wasn't that one of the stages in pilot wings no no but very very good looking

02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:43.940
graphics i assume i remember flight flight simulators were always really good demonstrators

02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:48.020
of like graphical capabilities that was also one of the stages at superman 64 shut up

02:34:51.380 --> 02:34:56.260
awesome well i mean how big of a presence does video gaming have at ces because we're usually

02:34:56.260 --> 02:35:00.980
told that it's kind of it's not there as much as you'd think well yeah that's an accurate statement

02:35:00.980 --> 02:35:08.580
it's definitely not not big in terms of video game related stuff um obviously at the microsoft booth

02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:15.700
and at the sony booth as well those are pretty obvious but uh other than that like you couldn't

02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:22.580
really find anything else uh that were video game related so those are like really the only two

02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:27.380
booths that you could go to to play actual video games gotcha was there anything just you know

02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:31.220
since we're all nerds here at olr was there anything that kind of jumped out at you like

02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:34.420
wow this is something i really want in my living room like even if it's not necessarily gaming

02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:38.740
related was there any device that just made you go like dang i want one of these next christmas

02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:47.220
tell you should not really not really it was just a lot of random cool stuff that would it's

02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:52.740
probably not ready for a consumer level until you know a few years down the line it's all too

02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:59.620
damn expensive how does one of those 100-foot hd TVs look in person it is pretty sweet gotta admit

02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:08.740
seeing that in person was was pretty eye-opening there awesome awesome well now is does the porn

02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:14.020
expo still go on next door at the same time or did that change now you know what that one the

02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:22.100
the original porn expo it now it's on like the week after cs however this completely separate

02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:28.900
company is doing another like adult convention thing they're in the same time so you know

02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:35.060
tapping into that market back to back adult cons in las vegas i guess i guess it can sustain we'll

02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:40.660
see good time one of these days i gotta make it to ces that's gotta be on my like my bucket list

02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:45.540
of things to do um at some point so because do you have to be industry to get into yes i don't think

02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:51.380
so i thought you did really technically you do but it's pretty easy is it like the old e3 it's

02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:55.540
really easy yeah it's pretty easy very cool very cool well vin power anything else you want to

02:36:55.540 --> 02:37:01.940
share with us tonight uh no just um just kind of giving you guys a quick gaming summary of over at

02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:08.900
ces i played some of the other house party games yeah um i am alive is good stuff i really enjoyed

02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:15.300
that it's really it's really fun it's like reminds me of prince of persia okay and uh the the combat

02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:20.420
quote unquote combat is uh remember playing uh middle gear solid games and you know you can hold

02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:27.060
up people by pointing a gun at them the entire combat is kind of centered around like intimidating

02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:32.180
your opponents by pointing a gun at them so that's like really original i had a lot of fun

02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:36.580
with that interesting did you play the new alan wake at all i did i did you know i didn't play

02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:41.940
too much of the first alan wake that played uh that was released but i got enough i played

02:37:41.940 --> 02:37:46.900
enough of this new one too it's it's really more of the same so if you were a fan of the first

02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:51.860
alan wake this new one is right up your alley interesting that it's downloadable but hopefully

02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:56.580
it does really well because i like the first alan wait game but i don't i guess it didn't it was

02:37:56.580 --> 02:38:00.900
kind of one of those games that sold gradually from what i understand like it never really was

02:38:00.900 --> 02:38:06.500
the chart topper but it was always kind of you know it lasted for a long time so definitely

02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:09.940
definitely all right well vin power i'm gonna let you go to get some more calls hopefully but um

a long time ago i went a few years ago there was no tram the last time i was in vegas and

02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:36.660
apparently they have like a whole tram thing that goes to all the big casinos now on the strip

02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:41.780

02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:59.460
you know that that travis plays a lot understation live i was actually there with jessica also from

02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:06.260
understation live that was the year 2000 that was october 2000 because i did two trips to vegas like

02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:10.020
almost back to back and then i haven't been back in like 10 years but uh that was the first time i

02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:21.860
really three quarters of a day a week between both jobs all right all right wow wow all right so

02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:24.980
crazy crazy what else did you got a chance to call in what do you want to talk about tonight any

02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:30.580
story or maybe something we missed uh well actually i'm going to be very honest i did

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:34.180
actually miss quite a bit of the broadcast so i'll actually have to go back and catch up on it

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:38.740
tomorrow but uh i just really kind of talk a little bit about a game that i've been playing

02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:45.380
recently called uh bastion actually oh yes of course bastion the canadian launches the game

02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:51.540
yes of course pretty much yeah like i'd uh actually i just double checked my skyrim count

02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:56.900
i've been playing skyrim for about 180 hours over the past two month and a half now and uh

02:41:56.900 --> 02:42:01.060
actually the video card died so i borrowing a replacement from a buddy of mine can't run

02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:07.140
skyrim but i can play bastion of it uh of all things so well bastion is you know not quite the

02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:14.260
cutting edge 3d graphics but sometimes it is not all about the graphics right no i mean it's not

02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:20.180
not at all in fact i find this sort of gaming revolution even though it's uh most of everything

02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:26.020
seems to be centered around 3d and you know impressive graphics i find there's still this

02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:33.140
growing movement to go you know old school or traditional sort of 2d with you know cell shading

02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:42.820
or you know that sort of thing 2d side scrollers even so um what what possessed you to decide to

02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:50.420
jump in and check out bastion um i actually picked up uh the demo online uh through the 360 back

02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:54.820
before the uh the console update with the dashboard and uh you know it was sort of an update right in

02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:59.540
my face i was like you know i love the artwork i'm actually a major fan of artwork uh working

02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:05.860
actually at a comic shop as well uh and it really stood out to me i found the artwork is uh is

02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:11.620
actually very fantastic very amazing um it's almost like somebody's like sketching the world

02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:16.100
and it just sort of comes to life and that stood out to me at the time so i'm playing this and i'm

02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:20.900
like wow you know the controls are very simplistic it's an incredibly basic story you don't even need

02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:27.700
to know anything about the game to start getting into it and you know even uh two hours into the

02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:32.500
game you're still like okay i still don't know the entire backstory so it's sort of driving you to

02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:38.820
uh really keep playing to find out how it's going to end and you know exactly what the calamity is

02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:42.980
now a lot of folks have kind of talked about the narration in the game and how important that you

02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:48.820
know the whole narration uh and narrating it as it's unfolding do you think the narration is

02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:54.660
something really unique to the game or are you kind of like ah this is gimmicky actually i i

02:43:54.660 --> 02:44:00.420
actually love the narration it's you know once in a while it's kind of cheesy but narration actually

02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:05.460
it really makes it feel almost kind of like you know like story time when you're a kid so to speak

02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:10.660
but it's not enough that it's there's not so much that you're like okay this is really something

02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:17.140
that annoys me it's a hate actually i never really thought of it that way sort of deal when it hits

02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:22.180
when it hits a new point um and you're just like well you know i kind of like the backstory dialogue

02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:26.580
when you're you're uh you know you smoke the little pipe you go to this little area to to

02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:31.940
essentially just grind and grind and grab pick up your little crystal shards or fragments and uh in

02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:36.020
between each wave there's a little piece of the kid's backstory in the background so it's like

02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:39.780
hey that's kind of neat bringing me up to speed on who i'm actually playing with and i thought it

02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:44.660
was kind of interesting that like as you kind of put that center area together it can kind of

02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:49.620
change the way the narration is going to because each building that you build kind of changes you

02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:55.380
know you get a little different narration for that so yeah actually i found the narration did

02:44:55.380 --> 02:45:00.820
change a little bit between buildings but by the end of it you know you're like i'm i'm not

02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:05.940
there like i'm i still have to be only about halfway through it but the i find the narration

02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:09.620
really ends up the same because you end up building the same buildings by the end of it

02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:16.260
anyway sure sure so it's so in a way there's a little bit of a sort of a multi-path but it's

02:45:16.260 --> 02:45:21.540
still a very linear storyline which there's nothing wrong with linear but the way they've

02:45:21.540 --> 02:45:25.940
gone about the story kind of makes you think well you know maybe if i played a little bit differently

02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:31.380
later on even though i know the ending is it going to be more of a challenge or am i going to

02:45:31.380 --> 02:45:36.420
discover things i didn't know were there before or so the game was really well developed in

02:45:36.420 --> 02:45:42.020
dragging and sucking you into it to see you through to the end all right well it sounds

02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:47.460
like uh you are definitely enjoying bastion so um are you hoping there's going to be a sequel

02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:55.060
as if i need to ask definitely i i can i can hope i mean there there have been the rumors of buzz

02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:59.620
online saying there is saying there aren't and you know we just all have to sort of cross our

02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:05.780
fingers but i figure once i finish this i'll probably round skyrim count up to 200 hours so

02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:11.700
all right nice all right well um cinderwolf thanks so much for the call and reminding us

02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:15.140
that you know bastion might be one of those games you missed at the end of 2011 amongst all the

02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:19.460
skyrim so uh definitely all right well cinderwolf you have a good one and thanks so much for calling

02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:52.660
years and you know so on so it's like yeah then the show has been going pretty much non-stop for

02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:56.820
10 we've never had a break over two weeks let's say two three maybe three we maybe had like one

02:49:56.820 --> 02:50:02.340
time there was like a three-week break that's the longest break we've ever had so so well um uni

02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:15.700
885s oh my god that's great you know what i have noticed with this expansion uh it's it's really

02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:21.140

02:50:46.020 --> 02:50:52.900
suvs whichever you play if you play terran it's suvs okay what you do is you constantly pump

02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:59.140
those out like around five minutes you make your next expansion it's like a whole entire build

02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:06.900
order it's all about build order if you do your build right and you make it right you win um my

02:51:06.900 --> 02:51:13.620
maker right now for protoss is immortals and void race you just pump out those two units and you

02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:21.300
send them to like the opposing team which you're playing against it smooshes their faces and it's

02:51:21.300 --> 02:51:26.980

this month you're welcome i owe you do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight thanks

02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:36.900

and steam rice delicious we're gonna eat that after the show wraps nom nom nom uh let's see

02:57:42.020 --> 02:57:46.900
my final thought is i just realized we have two posters in here that say haters to the left and

02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:50.660
one points one way and one points the other so i'm confused which way did the haters go

02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:57.300
because they're on opposite walls either out the front door or into the kitchen to cook for us

02:57:57.300 --> 02:58:00.660
into the okay fair enough all right uh let's say into the oven oh my god

02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:08.020
like like the witch like a tansel and gretel all right loki your final thought tonight uh

02:58:08.020 --> 02:58:15.060
my final thought is uh i really don't want to eat mcdonald's anymore i'm gonna try to stop is that a

02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:18.580
late new year's resolution is that what i'm hearing no it's been one i've been toiling

02:58:18.580 --> 02:58:23.700
around and i was actually gonna do that i was just running a little bit late um this evening

02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:27.620
so there wasn't really any time for me to stop anywhere else i could have heated up some soup

02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:33.940
but i didn't have a lot of time to do that so i made this uh this cheddar and beer soup i don't

02:58:34.580 --> 02:58:41.860
care for it too much though because it it the beer didn't cook out and so it's gotta like

02:58:41.860 --> 02:58:46.100
you know you can if you drink the whole pot of it i guess you can get a little bit buzzed but uh

02:58:47.220 --> 02:58:51.780
it wasn't it wasn't quite how i had pictured i put too many leaks in it too it's too sweet

02:58:51.780 --> 02:58:57.380
sorry i'm laughing at what act deaf said in chat and i'm assuming this is about the

02:58:57.380 --> 02:59:05.220
haters to the left sign the points to the kitchen haters gonna bake it works kinda right we're all

02:59:05.220 --> 02:59:12.500
