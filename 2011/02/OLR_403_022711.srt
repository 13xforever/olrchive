00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,880
Tonight, February 27th, 2011, the 3DS launches in Japan.

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,680
We Dare might be too daring for the U.S., and will Guitar Hero get more download content

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,680
after all?

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,760
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,320
We tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific,

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,020
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,880
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Booze.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
How you doing?

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Booze.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
What kind of booze?

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,320
Apparently she's drank too much of that booze already.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
No, no, no, no.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
I have...

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
She dumb forgot.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,320
Stop interrupting me.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I have Irish...

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Wait, did you guys hear that?

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,720
This is worth interrupting because did you hear her say, stop interrupting me.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
She's slurring already.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Stop interrupting me.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
No.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,560
I have Baileys Irish cream with the last of my Kahlua and ice cubes and whipped cream,

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,260
but I've mixed the whipped cream into it.

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,400
So it cuts some of the alcohol and increases the calorie count tenfold.

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,720
It's like a tablespoon, but it is Supra delicious.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Sunday night.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Relax a little.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Yeah.

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,880
Since a belly button is in here.

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,680
Well, let me get to that.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,020
Tech master Loki is out tonight.

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,720
He actually had an emergency circumstance this week.

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Don't worry guys.

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
He's fine.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,480
But what happened, I guess he went in on Tuesday to the doctor and found out he had a hernia

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
or...

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,720
The same kind his child did.

43
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
That's like father, like son, right?

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,440
Except in reverse, like son, like father.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,660
So you know, and I'm only telling you what it is because I know he's going to give you

46
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,600
all the sort of details about it when he comes back.

47
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
It's a hernia.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,080
I don't know if that'll be next week or two weeks.

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Yeah.

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
I mean, it's...

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Living with a hernia.

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,880
So he had to have the surgery for that or I guess availability came up on Friday or

53
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
something like that.

54
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,840
He didn't know he was going to have the surgery and suddenly it was like, you're having the

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
surgery.

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Okay.

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,320
So he had the surgery, which, you know...

58
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,280
My favorite thing to do is confuse, and sometimes it's done on purpose, is confuse hernias and

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,120
hemorrhoids and ask if they need a donut.

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,760
Little different, little different.

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,280
So yeah, he's recovering.

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,760
He's not able to drive out to the show.

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
He could be listening.

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,680
So hi, Loki, if you're listening.

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,520
But he's probably sleeping because I know when I had surgery, granted I had the gall

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,660
bladder thing, which is a little different, but I slept for like seven days straight.

67
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,840
So that could be where Loki's at right now.

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
I don't know.

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,940
But regardless, he won't be here tonight.

70
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,940
So it's just Dark Soccer and I holding down the fort.

71
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,800
We didn't have enough time since we just found out about it on Friday and I'm usually gone

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
on the weekend.

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,760
We didn't have time to cook up a guest host.

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,240
So it's just here, just the two of us here.

75
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,500
And one of us has been drinking.

76
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,880
So this is sure to be a wonderful show tonight.

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,520
Rob had some of my tasty beverage.

78
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,920
It is delicious, isn't it?

79
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Nothing.

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,960
But luckily we have you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com joining us as you

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,640
do every week here as we tape live our show.

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,000
We couldn't appreciate you guys anymore, especially this week.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,180
You guys are awesome.

84
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,440
And speaking of chat room stories, some folks were asking before the show, can we talk about

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
the Oscars?

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Because that's going on tonight.

87
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
On top of everything else, the Oscars are going on tonight.

88
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
I want to call them the Betty White's curse.

89
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,360
Well, I'll get to that in a minute.

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,280
The Oscars are going on and it's one of the few shows that airs live on the West and the

91
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
East Coast.

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,360
I don't know of anything else, maybe the Super Bowl, that airs live on both coasts at the

93
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
same time.

94
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
So I think anybody who's watching, it's probably watching it in one eye and maybe listening

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
to our show or what have you or waiting for the podcast.

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I don't know.

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,160
But yeah, I don't know why you'd want to yell out the winners in the chat room because anybody

98
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,760
who cares probably already has on the TV, but whatever.

99
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
People want to yell it out.

100
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,840
And I think SSJ went under Matt a joke before the show that if Betty White's not at the

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,380
Oscars, who cares?

102
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,580
And I said, look, you can, fine, you can yell out the names of the winners, but you just

103
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,480
have to change everything so that Betty White won everything.

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,560
And so now Betty White has just become the new Chuck Norris in our chat room.

105
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,900
But you know what, guys?

106
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,320
I think it's very well deserved.

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
You know why?

108
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
You know why it's well deserved?

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Hold on.

110
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Listen to this.

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
The reason I lied.

112
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,700
If I told you the truth, you'd hunt it down and kill it, which seems to be exactly what

113
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,820
you're trying to do.

114
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,080
How long have you been feeding this thing?

115
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,240
Six years.

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,840
Six years.

117
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,640
Well, Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home.

118
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,400
He threw it some scraps, and well, he didn't seem to bother anybody.

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
He became kind of like a pet who lives in the wild.

120
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
He just appeared.

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,720
You have no idea how he arrived here.

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,120
No, do you?

123
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,520
Well, your husband Bernie, you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded.

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,120
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
There you go.

126
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

127
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
That's why Betty White is awesome.

128
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
I love her.

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Yes.

130
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Amazing.

131
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,840
Anyhow, that was the movie Lake Placid, by the way, if you never saw that.

132
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,280
Really corny ass movie, but Betty White made it, of course.

133
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Of course.

134
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,380
Anyhow, let's see, yeah, so we're going to get into the show as you guys join us in our

135
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,380
chat room.

136
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,640
We're going to do a little bit of a short show.

137
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,600
We're doing an abbreviated show tonight, meaning we're not going to have a break in the middle

138
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,560
and we're going to blaze right through both halves of our show.

139
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Don't worry.

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
We're still going to take calls at the end.

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,200
We're still going to do all your favorite segments.

142
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,400
We're just doing it a little shorter tonight because we don't have Loki, for one, and it's

143
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
just the two of us.

144
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,720
With everything we're competing against and so forth, we figured, you know what, let's

145
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,680
have this be a minimum day.

146
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Remember those in school?

147
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
You'd have a minimum day.

148
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
We never had such a thing.

149
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Huh?

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
We didn't have minimum days.

151
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Really?

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
We had minimum days here all the time.

153
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
We had teacher work days.

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Oh, okay.

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
It's similar.

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,520
But teacher work days were awesome because guess who didn't have to go to school?

157
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,080
That would be all of us.

158
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
But the teachers did.

159
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,360
The teachers did.

160
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,940
We're having a minimum day here at OLR so we can go have a business meeting at Pinkberry.

161
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
So there you go.

162
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,080
Actually, there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, but things I can't tell

163
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
you about.

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
Dude, Spazanator said that if he has alcohol, he'll go psychotic and die.

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
That's no good.

166
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
You probably wouldn't do it.

167
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,480
I had a friend in college who was schizophrenic and took LSD.

168
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Wow.

169
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
It's Mystique.

170
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Mystique?

171
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Mystique, you want to sit in on the show for a minute?

172
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,720
Come in and introduce yourself as- Oh, God, I love Mystique.

173
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm so happy she's here.

174
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Hold on.

175
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Hello.

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
We gotta get her hooked up.

177
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Live radio, folks.

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
I am the goddamn Batman.

179
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
That she is.

180
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,580
Why are you the goddamn Batman, which by the way, is one of my favorite Twitter accounts

181
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,200
that they have anywhere?

182
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,820
Because I'm awesome.

183
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,820
What more do you need?

184
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm awesome.

185
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Then she's got a Batarang in her pants.

186
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
Okay, there.

187
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,920
I've got you your own mic now.

188
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
So there you go.

189
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Sweet.

190
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,800
So what are you up to these days, Mystique?

191
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
What have you been playing?

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
You playing video games these days?

193
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
What are you playing?

194
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,480
Of course she is, because she just got the thing.

195
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Tell them what you got.

196
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
I got what?

197
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
The Batman.

198
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,120
Oh, I already did the Batman Arkham Asylum, because that game was awesome.

199
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,480
But the new one's coming out.

200
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
I know.

201
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,280
It's not coming out soon enough, though, because I need it now.

202
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Like now.

203
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Because it's goddamn Batman.

204
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah, it's the goddamn Batman and the goddamn Joker.

205
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,800
See, it's not about Batman for her, it's about Joker.

206
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,120
It's all about the Joker and not the Heath Ledger Joker.

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,320
Oh, what you got against Heath Ledger?

208
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,400
It's Oscar night.

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I don't care.

210
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,240
Betty White's winning everything, by the way.

211
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,280
We don't care who won anything in the Oscars as long as Betty White did it.

212
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,560
Unless Betty White did it.

213
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Betty White is pretty awesome.

214
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Yeah, that's right.

215
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,920
Betty White has actually just announced the new villain in the next Batman movie, so there

216
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
you go.

217
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,540
She's gonna be Catwoman, actually.

218
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,000
She just took down that bitch Anne Hathaway behind the stage and was like...

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,880
I can totally see that shit.

220
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Betty White is hardcore.

221
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
That's right.

222
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,800
And of course the next game coming out is Betty White versus Capcom.

223
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,560
I would totally play that game.

224
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,200
She heard that Anne Hathaway got the part of Catwoman, and this is what she said in

225
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
response.

226
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,200
If you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded...

227
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,360
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

228
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
There you go.

229
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I concur with that.

230
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
All right.

231
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Anyhow.

232
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,220
I remember certain conversations where someone in this room used to say, I wish I had one

233
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
of those.

234
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
I do wish I had a dick.

235
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,600
It would be awesome.

236
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Why?

237
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,480
Because then I could pee wherever I was and...

238
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,800
It doesn't quite work like that.

239
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,920
Hold on.

240
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,160
And when I beat the crap out of somebody, I could whip out my dick and piss all over

241
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
him.

242
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,120
Can't you kind of do that now?

243
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
I mean, I realize...

244
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
It's messier.

245
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,680
It's messier because you really got to take down your pants.

246
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
All right.

247
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Look.

248
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
There's a lot of work.

249
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Oh, look.

250
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,680
The listener count is plummeting as we hear these details.

251
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,600
I told them about you in wild chat last night, by the way.

252
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Sweet.

253
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm famous.

254
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
All right.

255
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm living with video game chat.

256
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah.

257
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
So let's talk about how is your gaming week?

258
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

259
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
I played WoW.

260
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,200
And then I played WoW.

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
And then when I was done playing WoW...

262
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Did you play more WoW?

263
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
I played WoW.

264
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,480
What are you doing in WoW?

265
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,880
Well, my mage is...

266
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,220
Because I basically power leveled everything up and didn't bother with my professions.

267
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,680
So now I've gone broke leveling dual crafting.

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,640
Now I'm working on mining and sort of archaeology, but not really.

269
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,680
That's because I think that reading some of this stuff is funny.

270
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Holy shit.

271
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,720
She's going to be an archaeologist like Indiana Jones.

272
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
He's in the game.

273
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Harrison Jones.

274
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,920
Shut the hell up.

275
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,160
And I believe someone does say no time for love, Dr. Jones.

276
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Sweet.

277
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Yes.

278
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
You gotta have a short round.

279
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Yeah.

280
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Oh, he's awesome.

281
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
I'll have to go back and show you videos of all that.

282
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
But anyway.

283
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,320
You just need to play for Harrison Jones, because that's what it's all about, is the

284
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,640
whole archaeology thing in Oldham.

285
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
So cool.

286
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,840
But anyway, and then I decided to work on my puppy.

287
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
I just call her my puppy.

288
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,720
I still hate dungeons on my puppy, because people don't know what a freaking tank is

289
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,000
apparently if you're lower than level 20.

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,240
But tanks run over people.

291
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,760
And tanks also take a lot of damage without feeling it.

292
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,480
I wish I had a tank.

293
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
I want a tank for real life.

294
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Wouldn't it be cool?

295
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,440
It's like if you were in school and you just had someone be your tank.

296
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
That would be pretty awesome.

297
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,240
You had your party, and your tank would be like, I don't feel anything.

298
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm Teflon.

299
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,480
I'm rubber, you're glue.

300
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,240
And you would always be able to find a parking spot.

301
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,880
And then you had your healer, who would basically go around going, it's OK, don't worry about

302
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
it.

303
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
You're going to be just fine.

304
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
They're idiots.

305
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
They're bitches.

306
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,880
And then you've got your other three friends who are your DPS.

307
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,640
Bitch, I heard what you just said.

308
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,120
It's on now.

309
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Bring it.

310
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,520
That would be World of Warcraft for high school.

311
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,920
I just put it on my Facebook.

312
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,480
Loki, if you're listening, this is what happens when you're not here.

313
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
Just sort of point that out.

314
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,960
You're missed a lot.

315
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,640
Yeah, but our aim's improving.

316
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,320
I made Misty laugh.

317
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Laughing is fun.

318
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
I had liquor.

319
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Want some?

320
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I know.

321
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
If it's not obvious.

322
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,640
What are you talking about?

323
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
She's always like this.

324
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,040
But I'm extra like this.

325
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
All right.

326
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us besides WoW?

327
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Betty White, the RPG.

328
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
All right.

329
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,840
Mystique, I think I already bugged you about this, but any specific games you've been playing

330
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,920
this week you want to share with the world?

331
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Oh, wait.

332
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Final Fantasy III.

333
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
OK.

334
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,260
Dude, I totally played some Dr. Mario.

335
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
You played Dr. Mario?

336
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
Hells yeah.

337
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Old school 8-bit?

338
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,260
Yeah.

339
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Game Boy, baby.

340
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,260
What?

341
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Game Boy.

342
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Dr. Mario.

343
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,680
What possessed you to get out the pills?

344
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Because sometimes you just need pills.

345
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,680
Different colored pills, especially the red one.

346
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,640
Is there a particular virus that's like, is it the red virus or the yellow virus?

347
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,800
She has the G-virus.

348
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,720
So if she doesn't have her pills, she turns into a zombie and totally sucks brains.

349
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,320
Because brains taste good.

350
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Itchy.

351
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Tasty.

352
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Itchy, tasty.

353
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,720
So, Dr. Mario, wait.

354
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,160
Actually, let me ask you the really compelling question when it comes to Dr. Mario.

355
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,120
Music type A or B?

356
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,480
Music type B. B for bitchin'.

357
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Yes.

358
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,600
Because I like to kick it old school.

359
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
What?

360
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
What?

361
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,280
You just made a song pop into my head.

362
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
What's that?

363
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
A dead milkman song.

364
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
It's a bitchin' Camaro.

365
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Bitchin' Camaro, bitchin' Camaro.

366
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
I ran over my mother.

367
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
I love that song.

368
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:46,280
I had to download that the other day so I could play it in the car.

369
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:52,160
Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungerator.com, Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, I think the women

370
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
just hijacked the show.

371
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
You know, I think you're right.

372
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
I think...

373
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Yay!

374
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Estrogen!

375
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Woo!

376
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Oh my god, help me.

377
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
We've got this.

378
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,680
The powers of the jubbles compel you.

379
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,640
The minute you guys start braiding each other's hair and start talking about boys.

380
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
My hair is already braided.

381
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
Missy pays someone to do hers, so...

382
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,840
I just flat iron mine.

383
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
You know, with an iron.

384
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,480
I like that you've got like purple and then black and purple.

385
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,500
You've got like a red X13 thing going on there.

386
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,760
Because this is always the color I have.

387
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Black and purple.

388
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
Because she's secretly, well not so secretly, evil.

389
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Did I say red X13?

390
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,320
That's a little bit redundant, isn't it?

391
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
It's red 13.

392
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Red 13.

393
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Alright.

394
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Rob?

395
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
See, and it matches my shoes.

396
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Her shoes are jokery.

397
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Oh, they are jokery.

398
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
What is it about the joker?

399
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm going to take a picture of Missy's shoes.

400
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
What is it about the joker you just love so darn much?

401
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,840
Because he likes to kill people, and that's a good thing.

402
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,560
She also likes prints for similar reasons.

403
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Exactly.

404
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Prints like to kill people too.

405
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Shoes.

406
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Alright.

407
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,760
This is our new album artist, Mystique Shoes.

408
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Awesome.

409
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,520
Alright, I'll talk about my gaming week.

410
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,320
I played a little bit of WoW as well, but I did play other stuff too.

411
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm actually really addicted to on the iPhone, and I know there's, like when I say that,

412
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,880
there's this whole cluster of people out there that's like, oh god, the iPhone.

413
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,280
I'm really addicted to Cut the Rope, you guys.

414
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,360
Like, it's adorable and cute and...

415
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,960
And the new game, Jump the Shark.

416
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,480
Is there really a game called Jump the Shark?

417
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I don't know.

418
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
There probably is somewhere.

419
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Alright.

420
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,720
There was an episode of Supernatural called Jump the Shark.

421
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Mystique has left the building.

422
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,480
Alright, well, alright, everybody calm down, it'll be okay.

423
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,300
And then what else have I played this week?

424
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,240
I played Bejeweled Blitz on the Xbox 360, which is, I guess you could say PopCap's way

425
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,160
of cashing in on the Facebook game, which has been doing very well for them.

426
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,680
Although I don't think this was developed by PopCap.

427
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,040
I mean, I think it was like in agreement with them, but I saw another developer's name come

428
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
up when I started the game.

429
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,040
And I gotta be honest, guys, I could tell that someone else developed this like right

430
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
off the bat.

431
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,360
Like, it just didn't have that same polish.

432
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,180
And I don't know how else to say this.

433
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,960
And I know I'm sounding like really harsh, but like when I go in there, especially with

434
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,440
the graphics, the graphics did not have that same polish that I have seen in the other

435
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
PopCap games.

436
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,880
It needs buffing.

437
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,940
And I guess, yes, the jewels needed to be polished, I don't know.

438
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,640
But yeah, it's okay.

439
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,760
I mean, it is what it is.

440
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,360
It's a minute-long version of Bejeweled.

441
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,100
And you compete against your friends and have the leaderboards.

442
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,980
And you can do regular Bejeweled, or you can do the twisty Bejeweled, the Gyromancer version

443
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
of Bejeweled.

444
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,960
You can do either of those in a minute-long versions.

445
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,160
And there's also like a multiplayer version online.

446
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,720
I didn't get to really test that too much.

447
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,680
But you know, it's pretty much what you'd think.

448
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,480
It's multiplayer Bejeweled.

449
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
I gotta be honest, though.

450
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,820
I didn't see a whole lot that made me feel like I had to buy this game.

451
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,240
And there already is Bejeweled Twist, or Gyromancer and Gyromancer, and then Bejeweled 2 on the

452
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
marketplace.

453
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,560
And Plants vs. Zombies has Bejeweled.

454
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,040
Yeah, and Bejeweled.

455
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,220
And there's even the Jewel Quest, the knockoff game.

456
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,800
And I just, I didn't really feel like there was enough of a game there where it was just

457
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,480
minute-long versions of Bejeweled.

458
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,760
Which is weird, I know, because I do like the version on Facebook, or at least I did

459
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
for a long time.

460
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,880
And, you know, you can have the one on the phone.

461
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,600
It just, for me, didn't translate too well to the controller.

462
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,160
I do like some of the things they did where your left stick moves the cursor, and then

463
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,640
the Y, X, A, B buttons flip the gems in that direction.

464
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,680
And in the older Bejeweled games, you used to have to pick two gems, then swap them,

465
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,160
and it was more button presses.

466
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,120
So they kind of made that faster, which is important because the game only goes a minute.

467
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,920
But you can play it for free on Facebook, and it's got that same level of competition.

468
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,360
Granted it doesn't have the twisty gem version, and granted it doesn't have multiplayer.

469
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,940
But I kind of feel like in PopCap's other games, you get enough of that.

470
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,460
So this kind of feels like a little bit of a cash-in to me.

471
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,240
I would really only recommend this game to somebody who doesn't have any of the other

472
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,820
Bejeweled games, who really loves their casual games, who's looking for this fix.

473
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,000
But I honestly think most of you would play this game for a little bit, and then go back

474
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,820
to the one on Facebook, if you really want to play Bejeweled.

475
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,760
Because I think the controller thing would drive you bonkers after a while, when you

476
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,200
can be so much faster with a mouse or with your finger.

477
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,480
It's just one of those games, it just didn't work in translation, and it's kind of a bummer.

478
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,960
And I kind of think that's why PopCap probably didn't do it themselves.

479
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Maybe.

480
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,480
They probably just kind of let somebody else do it, so yikes.

481
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,680
They're going to give us how much money for this game?

482
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,860
Outsource the scrap.

483
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,800
It's $10, if you want to buy that on Xbox Live Marketplace.

484
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,600
There's a lot of great stuff coming out of the Turnpike on Xbox Live Marketplace that

485
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,280
I'm definitely checking out over the next few weeks.

486
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,160
Beyond Good and Evil HD, a lot of people looking forward to that.

487
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,480
Torchlight, oh my god, I'm so excited for Torchlight on Xbox Live.

488
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,840
I am so curious to see, speaking of a game that feels very one-way on the PC, I'm really

489
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,320
curious to see how they translated this to Xbox 360 controller, because apparently they

490
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,720
change quite a bit.

491
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,300
So I'll definitely be checking that out.

492
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,600
I think that's the 15th that that comes out, so I'll be looking at that.

493
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
And that does it for my gaming week.

494
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,320
So let's move on and go over some housekeeping real quick.

495
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,960
Not a whole lot.

496
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,080
I just want to mention of course our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and of

497
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,200
course you can follow OrangeLoungeRadio on Facebook as well.

498
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,960
And if you like OrangeLoungeRadio and you like all this craziness and zaniness that

499
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,560
we bring you every week that's sometimes very random as it was tonight.

500
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,140
I just found out something, Rob.

501
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
What's that?

502
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,880
You mentioning PopCap made me want to check for Peggle on Steam.

503
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Peggle Extreme is free.

504
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Free?

505
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Really?

506
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Free.

507
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Free?

508
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm installing it right now.

509
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
What's so extreme about Peggle Extreme?

510
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
No idea, but I love Peggle.

511
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Oh, there you go.

512
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
PSA for the listeners.

513
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Go check that out.

514
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Well, now you made me lose my train of thought.

515
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,080
You interrupted me for some stupid Peggle.

516
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,700
Oh, yeah.

517
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,360
Help spread the word about the show and leave us a nice review on iTunes.

518
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
We always appreciate that.

519
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
And a couple more have popped up in the past few days.

520
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,880
We really, really do appreciate you guys taking the time out to leave us a nice review.

521
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,320
And that doesn't have to just be iTunes.

522
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
I know some of you guys are like, oh, I'm never going to touch iTunes with a 10-foot

523
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,520
pole or wherever it is that you can read about podcasts if you can leave a nice review for

524
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
us.

525
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
That'd be awesome.

526
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
All right.

527
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,040
So, let's move on to some gaming news.

528
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Let's get into the news tonight.

529
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,720
We're going to start off with the 3DS launch.

530
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,640
The 3DS did launch in Japan.

531
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,280
It did make its release date.

532
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,080
And I guess, you know, it was a very cold day in Japan, but people were still lining

533
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,380
up for it.

534
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,240
There were extras left over.

535
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,820
You didn't have to pre-order it.

536
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,880
They were able to get their hands on it if they didn't pre-order it.

537
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,760
However, the initial shipment of 400,000 units already gone.

538
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,000
That's the early word.

539
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, not surprising.

540
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Not surprising.

541
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The same thing happens here.

542
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
Because it prints money.

543
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,820
I think if you're on it day one, you can get it, but it'll sell out that first shipment

544
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
pretty quick.

545
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,400
So, just so you know, they did have people that were camping out for it.

546
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,120
They had eight launch titles over in Japan.

547
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,160
Some of the best-selling ones, at least visually, I mean, they're not going to know until the

548
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
numbers come out.

549
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,960
But people that were on location reporting, watching what people were buying, saying that

550
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,520
Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition and the Professor Layton game appeared to be the big

551
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,760
sellers, which will probably be similar over here, at least with Super Street Fighter.

552
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Did Professor Layton make launch over here?

553
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm not sure it did.

554
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
I don't recall.

555
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,820
I think it might have been.

556
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,040
The Layton games are fairly popular here, too.

557
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah.

558
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Oh, yeah.

559
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
They definitely have their audience.

560
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,880
But I think the Super Street Fighter will probably be the big seller out the gate.

561
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,800
And honestly, Nintendogs, I think is going to be a huge one for Nintendo.

562
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,280
Just knowing that the target audience, again, not the folks that listen to this podcast,

563
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,440
but kids, you know, between the ages of like, I don't know, when do kids start using this

564
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,840
the 3DS, maybe like 6, 7 on up through 13 are going to be all over Nintendogs and cats.

565
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,160
And I think even some adults will be, too.

566
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,320
And I got to admit, I'll probably buy it because I'm a sucker.

567
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Big sucker.

568
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Tee hee.

569
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,760
So there you go.

570
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
Yeah.

571
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
So it's sold out now in Japan.

572
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,040
So if you didn't already import this thing, you might have a hard time.

573
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,860
You're gonna have to wait for the next shipment.

574
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,120
But it does sound like it's a successful launch over there.

575
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
Now we want to hear about the next wave of games coming out.

576
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,280
But I guess we'll just have to wait until E3.

577
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Yeah.

578
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,680
Well, I was looking at all the, they've definitely got all the pre-order stuff going on at GameStop

579
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,800
today, which is where I went today to pick up Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

580
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
And they're pushing it.

581
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920
So hey.

582
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,040
But how about something that's a little naughty, Rob?

583
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,600
Yay, I love naughty things.

584
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Naughty.

585
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,160
Wait, should we get Mystique back for this?

586
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,280
Because she's pretty naughty, too.

587
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
A little randy.

588
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Oh, okay.

589
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
A little raunchy.

590
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
A little sassy?

591
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,320
Oh, more than a bit sassy.

592
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Alright.

593
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,400
We have a game that's called We Dare.

594
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,440
It's a party game that's put out by Ubisoft.

595
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,640
And well, it's not coming out in America.

596
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,540
In fact, their spokesperson said it absolutely will not see release in the United States.

597
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,160
The trailer has been region locked to Europe.

598
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,920
And well, really, it has you spanking your friends and snogging your controller and getting

599
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
naked.

600
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
What?

601
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Release in your underwear.

602
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Okay, wait.

603
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,160
Is this the trailer here?

604
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,600
Can I watch this or is this going to tell me I can only watch this because it's bound

605
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
to Europe?

606
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Or is this going to work?

607
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
It may, it may.

608
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
It may.

609
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
It's been two years.

610
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,520
Well, now there's a stupid ad playing, so no one cares about the ad.

611
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,160
Oh, this is a really slow site.

612
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Let me see if it's on YouTube somewhere.

613
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,320
We're going to go to YouTube.

614
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
Okay.

615
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
I want to see this.

616
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
I literally have not.

617
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,800
I heard about the game, but I didn't watch this trailer.

618
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,920
Well, I'm going to pull up the- So it's like, what?

619
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
It's like Truth or Dare?

620
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,360
Well, I'm pulling up the Amazon UK product description.

621
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,080
Wow, it's $16.99 over there.

622
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
And let's see.

623
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Okay, wait.

624
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Here we go.

625
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Here we go.

626
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,080
I got a trailer.

627
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:56,240
Okay, right off the bat, that sounds like a Cinemax movie score there in the background.

628
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,160
The cover has a pink chair with a bra on it and a fuzzy handcuffs and some high heels.

629
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Wow.

630
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Hold on, hold on.

631
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay, so there's this mini game where there's like an apple.

632
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,480
And the two of them are eating it.

633
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,080
And somebody is like dangling a Wiimote between these two people that are just kind of like,

634
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
it's a little bit.

635
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:43,080
I'm going to leave the thing in the chat room.

636
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,220
Wow.

637
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,360
So this chick had to put a Wiimote in her back pocket, kind of like tucked into the

638
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
back of her pants.

639
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,720
And now the boys are spanking her in order to fly through the cloud level here.

640
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:06,800
Now this other chick, she took her ponytail out.

641
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:15,200
And of course, the chicks get to spank each other.

642
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:35,800
Okay, I want someone to get that for me.

643
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Here's the thing.

644
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,040
I'll send you candy.

645
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,680
Okay, so those are like dumb little party games that to be honest, what's the uproar

646
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
about this?

647
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,200
I would say that kids would play this because it's a Wii game.

648
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,240
And you know, the target audiences is usually kids because people over here have the big

649
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
anal stick.

650
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Okay, here's the thing.

651
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,560
I'm honestly watching those things that are going on.

652
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,720
Those are all the games we played at parties when I was 12.

653
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,760
Yeah, like remember two minutes in the closet, spin the bottle.

654
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,900
Like all that I mean when you were 12 I was at a party five years ago where you're playing

655
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,880
spin the bottle.

656
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,160
Well you kind of defused the point I was about to make because I was going to say now you're

657
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,000
trying to tell me that a bunch of 20 year olds are going to play these same games that

658
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,320
we played when we were 12.

659
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Yes.

660
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
Look, we were drunk.

661
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Okay, that's all I'm saying.

662
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,440
I don't need a Wii to help you with that.

663
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
You know what I mean?

664
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,680
I don't need a Nintendo Wii to help me with that.

665
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
It's a fun idea.

666
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,680
I think that Ubisoft is just being, oh the Americans are going to preach at us.

667
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,320
They're going to sing Jesus on us.

668
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,080
No, it's a little silly that the game can't come out here.

669
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,240
You know, Gripper 01 says it's 16 quid cheap by the way.

670
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,440
Why don't they just put a gigantic red warning label that takes off half the box that says

671
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,720
not for kids and then honestly it will sell more copies if it has that sticker on it.

672
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,760
Because people here don't give a shit.

673
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
They don't read the box.

674
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
The kids read the box.

675
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,920
Their parents don't read the box.

676
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,040
They expect the person behind the counter to babysit for them.

677
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
And guess what?

678
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
No.

679
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
And then they get all mad.

680
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,960
Oh, but my little kid has this game and they're spanking people in it.

681
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,000
Well, why didn't you supervise the purchase?

682
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,560
Hi?

683
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,640
So I guess it's just too much for us.

684
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,560
Do your damn job.

685
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,800
You could import it I guess if you really wanted.

686
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,280
But I will send a bunch of American candy.

687
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Will this come out in Canada?

688
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
To anyone.

689
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
I wonder.

690
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
I think that's a fair question to ask.

691
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Maybe it will come out in Canada.

692
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,840
I can get it from Amazon CA.

693
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Uh huh.

694
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Ooh, let's check.

695
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Exactly.

696
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
All right.

697
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Meanwhile, I'm going to move on to something else.

698
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,640
Although if they get me President Cat, first I'll be happy.

699
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,080
I'm going to move on to something else that sounds like a lot of fun, but in a totally,

700
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,180
totally different way.

701
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,760
This isn't really naughty fun so much as it is, well, you know, you know the dark soccer

702
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
myself.

703
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,720
I like Disneyland more than anything and this has to do with the theme park.

704
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,960
I do like booze a lot.

705
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Is there a beer land?

706
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,340
Like, is there like a Disneyland that's just booze everywhere?

707
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Probably not.

708
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,400
Anyhow, this probably won't be it either.

709
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
There's a California adventure.

710
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,520
A brand new amusement park in China that is going to feature Warcraft and Starcraft sections

711
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
in it.

712
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
This is legitimate.

713
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
This is not like a trolling thing.

714
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,680
There's pictures of construction that are showing up already.

715
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,240
By the way, not coming out in Canada.

716
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
It's not on their list.

717
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Oh, bummer.

718
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
All right.

719
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,920
The park is called Joyland.

720
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,720
It's going to be in the Wuzhen District of China.

721
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,000
There's going to be five district areas.

722
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,240
World of Legend, Mole's World, the Island of Mystery, and then there is Universe of

723
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,460
Starcraft and Terrain of Warcraft.

724
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,900
The park is supposed to be opening in March.

725
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,620
Some pictures have leaked to the internet and you can see the construction going on

726
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,000
there and it looks pretty impressive.

727
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,460
Like they're actually building like a castle that looks like the one in Stormwind and one

728
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,320
of those little outpost thingies that the aliens have in Starcraft.

729
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,480
This actually looks really cool.

730
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:15,640
It's a huge, huge infringement of intellectual property, but because you have the whole international

731
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,080
thing coming into play, it's really hard to say what Blizzard can actually do about it.

732
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,740
Now, some of the big blogs here in the US have tried to reach out to Blizzard for comment,

733
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,960
but of course I don't think Blizzard's going to say anything publicly.

734
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,920
We wish we thought of this first.

735
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,520
Well, that's kind of what I was getting to is that a lot of people, you know, you've

736
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,080
seen this kind of spread across game blogs this week and so forth.

737
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,400
A lot of people think this is a cool idea.

738
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,360
So why don't we have some type of video game theme park already if there's so much interest

739
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,880
in something like this?

740
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,960
Like for real, why don't we have like a video game theme park?

741
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,280
We've got a Harry Potter park too late.

742
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,960
Why not?

743
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,000
Do you think that maybe the audience is just not, I mean, for a World of Warcraft theme

744
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,240
land in a park, people wouldn't be into that?

745
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,180
I think that they're looking at overall closures of theme parks in the US and thinking that

746
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,600
something like that would be too much of a risk to venture the money on.

747
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,360
Why not try to fix something that's already there?

748
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,580
And I'll give you a great example, honestly.

749
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,520
Here in Northern California, one of the only theme parks we have is a place called Great

750
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,200
America in Santa Clara.

751
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,680
And that place used to be awesome, but it's kind of gone downhill in the past couple of

752
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
years.

753
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,600
And then they lost the Paramount licensing so they don't have Top Gun the ride anymore.

754
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,800
It's Flight Deck.

755
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,680
And I think the only like tie-ins they have is they have like Nickelodeon areas and they

756
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,160
have a Survivor ride.

757
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,800
Yes, they turned the TV show Survivor into a ride.

758
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
It's actually really cool.

759
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,440
It's one of the better rides in the park, honestly, but it's just basically a little

760
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,600
disc-oriented rollercoaster that really has nothing to do with the damn show.

761
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,160
You don't vote people off the ride or nothing.

762
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
That'd be cool.

763
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:05,160
But my thought is, why not try to team up with a park that's badly in need of some fresh

764
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,420
air?

765
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,160
Or here's another great example, Knott's Berry Farm.

766
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,680
I've never been.

767
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,640
Knott's Berry Farm's always kind of been the laughing little brother sitting in Disneyland's

768
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
shadow.

769
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,000
And so maybe something like this could help bolster a park's image and give people a reason

770
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
to go.

771
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,840
Especially, I mean, Great America being in Santa Clara, being in the heart of Silicon

772
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,480
Valley, is there any better place to build a theme park?

773
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,840
Right.

774
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
They should do it.

775
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
I think they should do it.

776
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Or they should just buy it.

777
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,280
I mean, Blizzard could probably sneeze and buy it, you know, with their rich money snot,

778
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
I guess.

779
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Yeah, I know.

780
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,580
So Bobby is linking me to this.

781
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,160
And I remember he was telling me about this before previously.

782
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:54,400
There's this website, I guess, of folks that are trying to build a theme park called DemandGameNation.com.

783
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
So I'm actually bringing up this website real quick.

784
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,920
So I apologize for any autoplay that's on here.

785
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,460
The first experimental video game theme park and resort.

786
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,240
And they show kind of all the latest news.

787
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Let's see.

788
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
What is this?

789
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,200
Let me click on this.

790
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:17,640
In the next 12 months, we'll be deciding the best location for the experimental theme park.

791
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,880
Visitors will be players as their dreams and fantasies come to life and adventures yet

792
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,540
to be told.

793
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,840
So in the next 12 months, they'll tell us where they're thinking about building the

794
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
park.

795
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,640
Dude, I'm telling you, just take something existing that needs the help, seriously.

796
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,680
But I'm glad at least some people are already on it, but that's a monumental undertaking.

797
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,840
That's going to take a lot of money and investments.

798
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,480
And you're right, Jamie, theme parks haven't been doing so well in the recession.

799
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,120
In fact, theme parks have been closing and so forth.

800
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,720
So I really think, I don't know, the smart thing would be to team up with a theme park

801
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,280
that's already there.

802
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,360
Buy an old one out and do your thing.

803
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,000
Reimagine the rides.

804
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Exactly.

805
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,680
And build it somewhere where people are going to want to visit for other stuff too.

806
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,860
Don't build it, you know, in South Dakota.

807
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,120
No offense to the residents of South Dakota, but, you know, you got what?

808
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Mount Rushmore?

809
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,440
Hi, I'm in Delaware.

810
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
So you know what I mean?

811
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,480
You got to build it somewhere where people are going to want to go.

812
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Seriously?

813
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,640
Tiger Claw on chat says, you know, we need an orange lounge radio theme park.

814
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,560
You know, I'm just not thinking there's going to be enough of an audience for that.

815
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,720
Maybe what we could get is we could get a booth at the video game theme park.

816
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,640
We would get a little corner of a room, the orange lounge radio booth.

817
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,320
That would probably be the best we could do.

818
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
All right.

819
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,080
We'd have, actually we probably wouldn't even have a booth.

820
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,400
We'd probably just, you know, be outside the front door.

821
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Exactly.

822
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
It's cold.

823
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
We're so cold.

824
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,040
Let us in.

825
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
You know what?

826
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,880
We get to drive the bus that goes from the parking lot to the front.

827
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
That's what we'll get to do.

828
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,260
We get to clean up after the tram.

829
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,760
And we'll get to, you know, give the little speech.

830
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,040
Hey guys, it's the orange lounge radio safety speech.

831
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,700
No eating, no drinking, no smoking.

832
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:15,080
Keep your arms, feet, hands, legs, and ass inside the tram at all times.

833
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,680
That'll be us.

834
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,480
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

835
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Yeah.

836
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:31,640
Well, how about, um, something a little bit, well, it kind of makes me laugh, because Portal

837
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:41,840
2, well, the German Playstation blog was told that it completely supports the move.

838
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,920
But it's not fully integrated yet.

839
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,160
Actually, Valve's like, no.

840
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,400
It was mistranslated from the English to the German.

841
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,520
And then, of course, translated from the messed up German back into English.

842
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,680
So nope.

843
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:08,560
They say that for the PC it will support the Hydra controller, and that it's going to support

844
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,720
the regular console controllers, but no move.

845
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,960
It could be patched in, but when asked about it, they said, who knows.

846
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,240
We don't know that it'll make the game better.

847
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,680
There's games that the Kinect and the Move are great for, but not this one.

848
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:31,480
So as they said, though, for the Hydra, that they actually invented puzzles specifically

849
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,480
for how the Hydra would work.

850
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,640
So no move, oops, nine.

851
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,640
I thought it would be a little weird if they just suddenly put the Move in, because, you

852
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,760
know, the PS3 version of Portal 2 is already going to have all these extra features that

853
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,640
aren't on the regular, or I'm sorry, not the regular, the Xbox 360 version, the USB-C version.

854
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,560
With the whole Steam integration and everything like that.

855
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,520
So it would be weird if they had the Move in the PS3 version and then nothing for Kinect.

856
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,200
It would just be weird.

857
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,480
Who said Loki and Tingle?

858
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Oh, that's...

859
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,840
They're talking about the stupid theme park.

860
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,720
This OLR theme park they want to have, where the ferret and President Kat would be mascots.

861
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
That's fantastic.

862
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
I love our chat room.

863
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Frisbee says there'd be a roller coaster.

864
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
I love our chat room.

865
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Oh, boy.

866
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,040
Alright, let's travel the world and check out some release dates, things that are actually

867
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,200
happening near you at a local game store near you.

868
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,440
Coming out this week in the US, since Loki's not here, I'll do the US dates real quick.

869
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,080
Do the Loki voice.

870
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,480
What's the Loki voice?

871
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,900
We got some stuff coming out.

872
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
This game's coming out.

873
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,240
It's probably gonna suck.

874
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
And some shit on PlayStation 3.

875
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
God damn you, Nintendo.

876
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
God damn you.

877
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,480
God damn you for releasing this game, Rango.

878
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Who's gonna play that?

879
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,760
Yeah, it's the dude in the Loki voice so that we can pretend we have him here.

880
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,960
March 1st is when Rango comes out on the Wii.

881
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Is that a movie or something?

882
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
I think it is.

883
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Johnny Depp does a voice, I guess.

884
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,000
I think there's a lot of people interested in Rift, though.

885
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,680
That is coming out on March 1st.

886
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,160
I believe some people already have it.

887
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,280
If you pre-ordered it, you get the whole early access.

888
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,520
The official release date for the game is March 1st.

889
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,440
This is a new MMO.

890
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Some people are saying it's the WoW Killer, but I hate that term.

891
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,640
It's not the WoW Killer.

892
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,320
The only WoW Killer is WoW.

893
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
Like the Remnant Empire.

894
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Yep.

895
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,780
Disgaea, the Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP comes out this week.

896
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,300
More versions of Rango on other systems, including the Xbox 360, blah blah blah.

897
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,780
A brand new racing wheel, if you're so inclined.

898
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,040
You need one for your PC, you can get a $300 racing wheel.

899
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,100
Should I show that to Dan?

900
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,280
Fight Night Champion comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.

901
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,600
And Mahjong Journey, Quest for Tikal.

902
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,480
For you Mahjong fans on the DS, oh boy, it's party time this week.

903
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Let's see if there's anything else here.

904
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm the people who really, really like Mahjong.

905
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,680
Well, it's party time.

906
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,320
Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice on the PS3, oh that's a pretty big one there.

907
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
Sounds like life at my house.

908
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,280
Yeah, there's some folks that have fun with Disgaea.

909
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,600
That's coming out.

910
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,960
And Fight Night Champion also comes out on the PS3.

911
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,720
Chuck E. Cheese's Sports Games comes out on the Wii.

912
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Really?

913
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,800
What is the Chuck E. Cheese Sports Games?

914
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,240
Is it dodging bullets?

915
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,440
And what else happens at Chuck E. Cheese these days?

916
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,560
Fights that break out at the tables with the animatronic characters.

917
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,080
Like, I don't know if you read the stories about all the really, really terrible things

918
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,820
that happen at Chuck E. Cheese, but let me just say, it's not a place I would ever take

919
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
my child.

920
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,520
No, no.

921
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,680
Chuck E. Cheese was awesome when we were kids.

922
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Yes, it was.

923
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,400
Now it's a dangerous place.

924
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:50,120
Now it's a frightening place, loaded with bad food and unwashed children.

925
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,760
Puzzle Expedition comes out on the Nintendo DS this week, and let's see if there's anything

926
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,400
else here I want to mention.

927
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,880
Minute to Win It on the Nintendo DS as well.

928
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,520
If you're a fan of that crappy game show, then you can get a crappy game to go with

929
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
it.

930
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
I've never heard of that one, Rob.

931
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
What is that?

932
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,920
It's hosted by that guy on the Food Network with the bleached hair who's like 15 years

933
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
old.

934
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,640
And it's like, dude, you're too old to bleach your hair.

935
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
He's such a bro.

936
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
He is.

937
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
He's a dude bro.

938
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,960
And he hosts this show where they give away like a million fucking dollars if he can throw

939
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,080
ping pong balls into cups.

940
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,520
Like it's the weirdest.

941
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
That's bizarre.

942
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:30,400
It's like, you know, the budget is that of going to Target and buying plastic wreaths

943
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,320
that they build games out of and they give away a million dollars.

944
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
And I guess that's a whole-

945
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,780
We made this game out of the dollar store.

946
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,980
So here's the deal, guys.

947
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:49,080
If you want to play the home version of Minute to Win It, you could spend $40 on the DS version

948
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,420
or you could go to the 99 cent clearance center and buy some ping pong balls and some plastic

949
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,680
cups and play the actual games that they play on the show.

950
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,760
Or you could pay 10 times as much and play some fake shit.

951
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,120
Shitty.

952
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,880
I am astounded every day at what goes on in this industry.

953
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,800
People are tarred.

954
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,320
And folks in chat rooms speaking up there, Defective Candy says his name is Guy and he's

955
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
from the Food Network.

956
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Yes, that's his name.

957
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Guy.

958
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
I think he owns a joint.

959
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Isn't Johnny Garlic's his chain or is that someone else?

960
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,560
I have no idea.

961
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Guy Fairey.

962
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Yeah.

963
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
That's it.

964
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
I think he owns that Johnny Garlic's.

965
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
There's one of those out in Roseville.

966
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Overpriced.

967
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
Yeah.

968
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:42,520
Anyhow, William Murderface in chat says it's beer pong for kids.

969
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Kinda.

970
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Kinda.

971
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
I'm serious.

972
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I'm serious.

973
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,840
Dark Sakura, I would love nothing more.

974
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,560
You know how people do like those YouTube reaction shots of people watching Two Girl

975
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,480
One Cup for the first time or whatever?

976
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Yeah.

977
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,360
What I would like to do is I'd like to have a reaction shot of you watching Minute to

978
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,180
Win It for the first time and just you going, what the fuck is this?

979
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,180
People fucking watch this?

980
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,640
This is why I don't watch TV.

981
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,440
This is a million dollars they give away for this?

982
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,400
I have to say something to X-Link real quick.

983
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
What's that?

984
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,240
Says that he needs to lose weight and not talk about food.

985
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,320
No, I don't want a skinny chef.

986
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
That's true.

987
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,440
You don't trust a skinny chef.

988
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:26,360
Julia Childs or those two fat British women who made everything with cream and lard because

989
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:31,160
you know their food was fucking delicious.

990
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,960
I want the fat British women to cook my food.

991
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
All right.

992
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,440
I have to think one of them died.

993
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
Can I do Japanese releases?

994
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Yeah, I guess.

995
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
All right.

996
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,660
Coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, Borderlands and a Hokuto Musou get price

997
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,040
reductions because they go into the platinum collections.

998
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,160
Friday Night Champion is the new release to look for on the Xbox 360 this week.

999
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,640
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they get Fight Night Champion there as well.

1000
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Yep.

1001
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,840
They also get Samurai Dou 4 comes out there from Spike.

1002
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,560
That is a, what kind of game is this here?

1003
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots.

1004
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,920
This looks like kind of like a adventure-y type of Yakuza-y type of game, but set in

1005
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,880
more like the ancient Japan and I doubt it's quite as in depth as those Yakuza games because

1006
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,800
I don't know if you ever played those games, but man, there's like tons of stuff you can

1007
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,240
do in them.

1008
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,320
On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.

1009
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,480
It's the Nintendo Wii.

1010
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,240
There's nothing coming out for it.

1011
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,200
On the Nintendo 3DS, yes, we have to start reading those dates now.

1012
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,760
On the 3DS, Shanghai 3D Cube and Super Monkey Ball 3D come out this week.

1013
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
More Mahjong!

1014
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
More Mahjong!

1015
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
That's right.

1016
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,120
Oh, by the way, Rob, apparently Betty White won for sound mixing in Inception.

1017
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,760
No one curr.

1018
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:50,720
On the Nintendo DS, we have Digimon Story in Super Stross Wars Red and Blue.

1019
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Digimon, Dr. Soccer, you were the only person I knew that liked Digimon.

1020
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,240
Oh, I liked the anime.

1021
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,880
And then you don't like the games?

1022
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
I had a Digimon.

1023
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,200
Lastly, on the PSP, this is a huge, huge release, probably the biggest release of the week,

1024
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,080
Dissida 012, Duodecim Final Fantasy, that's right, the sequel to Final Fantasy Dissida

1025
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,120
makes its way out in Japan this week on the PSP, so I'm sure there will be a lot of folks

1026
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
into that.

1027
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,160
Alright, how about the UK?

1028
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,420
Well for the UK, we do have some interesting news.

1029
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,080
This is BBC2 bringing you the news on game releases in the United Kingdom.

1030
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:30,760
Okay, actually on the first we have Fable 3, again, Fable 3 was kind of crap.

1031
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,840
We have Two Worlds 2, we have Beyond Good and Evil HD, that one's on the second by the

1032
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
way.

1033
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,400
On the fourth we have Fight Night Champion, Hybrid Dimension Neptunia, Pokemon Black,

1034
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:50,480
Pokemon White, Rift, Planes of Who Gives a Crap, I mean, sorry, Talara, and U-Draw.

1035
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,120
It wasn't that bad, Rift was interesting, but I don't know, I can't pay for another

1036
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,360
MMO right now, I've got too many other expenses to worry about.

1037
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,520
I can't pay for them either.

1038
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
So, that's it?

1039
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
That's it.

1040
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,660
Alright, then let's move on to some rapid fire news, we're gonna go over some news very

1041
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,800
quickly here.

1042
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,640
By the way, this is your last chance to get the Twitter topics in, we're gonna be doing

1043
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,280
Twitter topics in just a moment, so get those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, we're gonna

1044
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,680
be doing those in just a minute.

1045
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,560
But first, I'm gonna start off with some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.

1046
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Dragon Age 2, the demo for that hit Xbox Live, and it's getting a lot of good reception out

1047
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,280
there, it's also on the PC and so forth.

1048
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,440
Dragon Age 2 is gonna be coming out very soon, and they have announced that there's going

1049
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,180
to be a theme song in the game by Florence and the Machine, who's a pretty popular band

1050
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,440
these days.

1051
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,720
They were really indie for a while, and then she did the dog days are over thing at the

1052
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,600
MTV awards, and it just blew up, they're huge, they're everywhere.

1053
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:50,200
Anyway, she's really awesome, actually, and a song from the album Lungs, called I'm Not

1054
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,440
Calling You a Liar, is being reimagined.

1055
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,280
So it's gonna be called I'm Not Calling You a Liar, Dragon Age 2, Variks theme.

1056
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,920
Here's the original, if you want a taste of what the song sounds like.

1057
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:19,400
So you kinda get the idea, they'll rework that song a little bit, it's not gonna sound

1058
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,640
just like that, but that's gonna be the theme song for Dragon Age 2.

1059
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,680
Some websites shut down this week, some community-based websites, as you probably heard about before

1060
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,360
on the show before us, Bobby Black Wolf Show, 360 Junkies was a blog about the 360, and

1061
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,680
unfortunately they had to close their door this week due to personal issues.

1062
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,180
Mygamercard.net was a pretty big website in the community that also had to shut down this

1063
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,520
week, so we lost two good ones this week, unfortunately.

1064
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,360
The story behind mygamercard.net, though, a little more dramatic.

1065
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,920
The founder of the website, Jason Young, left a pretty big goodbye on the site, saying,

1066
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,000
quote, the love for community has been lost by Microsoft, saying that a lot of the community

1067
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,520
stuff that has been going on has stagnated, and even used the term lack of respect, ouch.

1068
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,240
But yeah, it does seem like things have changed a little bit community-wise over at Xbox.

1069
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,360
I mean, you know, they closed the Gamerscore blog a little while ago, I know Trixie360

1070
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,480
isn't involved anymore, she went to another company, you know, it's just...

1071
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
She's great.

1072
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,960
Yeah, she's cool, and it's just different over there now.

1073
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,280
So it's, I don't know, it's kind of unfortunate.

1074
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,120
I wonder if this will serve as a wake-up call to Microsoft.

1075
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,880
Maybe there will be some type of community thing in response.

1076
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,160
I think it's going to be very interesting to see if Microsoft responds to this, or if

1077
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
they just don't care.

1078
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,720
It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that.

1079
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,000
Because a lot of people were using that GamerCard service, you know, on their websites, and

1080
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,320
I even had it on my LiveJournal.

1081
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
We had a little, you know...

1082
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,440
Yeah, set it up when it worked.

1083
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,760
Just for kicks.

1084
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Yeah.

1085
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Unfortunately, yeah, they're shut down, so yikes.

1086
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,560
Anyhow, one other quick thing I want to mention to you guys, it's something called Every Air.

1087
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:10,040
It's a program that will let you play PlayStation 3 games on an iOS device, like the iPhone,

1088
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,720
the iPad, or the iPod, what have you.

1089
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,120
Yeah, it's a group of iOS developers that are working on a customizable software that

1090
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,060
lets you play high-end PS3 games on your iOS.

1091
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,220
So it's something where they've done this with wrangling of hardware and software.

1092
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,960
They will actually let you play PS3 games on the iPhone, iPad, and so on.

1093
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,800
I think what's going on, they actually like stream it.

1094
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,760
They explain how this works.

1095
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,680
The trick is to connect a capture device and a USB mouse keyboard device to the PS3.

1096
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,500
The capture device sends video data to the PC, and the USB keyboard and mouse sends the

1097
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,680
button presses.

1098
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,400
On the PC itself, you run a custom build of Every Air, which understands custom gestures

1099
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:59,560
and pipes the input into the PC, which then sends it to the PS3 via the input interpreter.

1100
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,160
Gotta be honest, this sounds like a whole lot for what's not going to be very practical,

1101
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,160
but they do show some video of this thing running.

1102
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,960
There's a whole little YouTube there.

1103
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,360
Let's see if we can get past the animation there, get to this thing actually working.

1104
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:18,600
Yeah, there's somebody playing LittleBigPlanet on their phone, starting it up.

1105
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,960
So, I don't know though, that seems like a lot just to get that working on your iPod.

1106
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,240
It doesn't, I don't know.

1107
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,120
But hey, it's one of those things where it's like installing Linux on a toaster.

1108
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,120
Why do it?

1109
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
Because we can.

1110
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Exactly.

1111
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,040
We do what we must because we can.

1112
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,040
Absolutely.

1113
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,040
So there you go.

1114
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,040
Yeah.

1115
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,040
Well, how about some other news, Rob?

1116
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,120
First of all, the PlayStation, sorry, the PSP, is going to be having a price drop.

1117
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,240
It's going to go down to $130.

1118
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,400
So I wonder if that's, you know, preparing the market, maybe clearing out some inventory

1119
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,160
for the new thingies coming out, but, you know, they've been slashing them, so now it's

1120
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,680
actually somewhat affordable.

1121
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,280
Who knows, right?

1122
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,840
And another happy, happy, happy news.

1123
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:13,040
The Legend of Zelda celebrates 25 years.

1124
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:20,640
We have had Legend of Zelda for a very long time, older than a lot of our listeners.

1125
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,920
And of course, we are going to be seeing Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword coming out, hopefully

1126
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,520
before too long.

1127
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,520
And pretty cool stuff.

1128
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,840
Rob, did you start off with the first one?

1129
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
Which one?

1130
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
I'm sorry.

1131
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,840
The first Legend of Zelda.

1132
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Oh, gosh, yes.

1133
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Of course.

1134
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
That was my very first Zelda game.

1135
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
I remember playing that in the fourth grade.

1136
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,840
That was one of the first games I had to buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1137
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
Fantastic game.

1138
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
And it was gold.

1139
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,560
Except I'm sad that it's 25 years old, because that means I'm old.

1140
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,880
No.

1141
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,600
And then there is an Xbox Live Arcade game that's a Minecraft clone.

1142
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:07,800
Actually it's done by Projector Games, and it's called, well, I just said, Fortresscraft.

1143
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,360
There's a Twitter for it, and they're releasing aspects of the game in different chapters.

1144
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:19,760
Chapter one is Minecraft Creative, chapter two is Crafting, three is Life, four is Machinery,

1145
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,860
five is Minions, six is PvP, seven is Fortress Assault Mode.

1146
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:29,560
So it says that the first chapter is going to be coming out for a dollar.

1147
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,040
March 4th, 80 bucks.

1148
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,040
Beware the Ides of March.

1149
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,040
Alright.

1150
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,040
That's not the fourth, is it?

1151
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,040
Whatever.

1152
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,040
Not yet.

1153
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,040
So yeah.

1154
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:45,000
Alright, let's go to the Twitter, and read some of the Twitter topics you guys have sent

1155
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,880
us tonight.

1156
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,480
Which isn't a lot.

1157
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,120
The tweets are looking very thin tonight, it must be because everybody's tweeting about

1158
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,720
the Oscars, I don't know.

1159
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
They're watching Betty White.

1160
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
I guess.

1161
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,600
Let's see, going to Morning Wolf on Twitter says, I thought of you guys when I played

1162
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
pinball yesterday.

1163
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Oh, that's sweet.

1164
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,600
What's going on in the pinball world?

1165
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,160
Pinacogo's coming up I think next month.

1166
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,640
What, Pinacogo's that big convention?

1167
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,640
Is that the one in Dixon?

1168
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,640
I think it's the one in Dixon.

1169
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,640
Oh god.

1170
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,760
But apparently they actually use the air conditioner now.

1171
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Oh, that's good.

1172
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,760
That'll be good.

1173
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,080
Last year it was still too hot.

1174
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,680
Are there any new pinball tables that have come out recently?

1175
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,920
Whatever Stern's put out.

1176
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,560
Oh yeah, there was the, they had a Dark Knight table, I remember seeing it.

1177
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,880
Stern's the only one doing anything.

1178
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,640
The last one, the last new table of theirs that I played was Iron Man.

1179
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Oh wow.

1180
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,560
And that was last year at Classic Gaming Expo.

1181
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,880
Let's see, Flaming Toilet was blanking on our email wanting to know if it was mailbag

1182
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,080
at OrangeLaundry.com.

1183
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,320
It is actually mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com.

1184
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,880
There you go.

1185
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,440
Tiger Claw is sending us a tweet that is Grand Theft Auto related.

1186
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,880
Well, I've got to say this in honor of Loki not being here tonight.

1187
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,680
Apparently Take Two has registered some Grand Theft Auto style domains.

1188
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:09,680
They include CashForDeadDreams.com, SixFigureTemps.com, LifeInvader.com, StopPayingYourMortgage.net,

1189
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,000
and HammersteinFaust.com.

1190
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,440
People are thinking that this all kind of sounds like the parodies that happen in Grand

1191
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,440
Theft Auto.

1192
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,600
It is Take Two that actually registered these domains, they're not just like random things

1193
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,600
out of the blue.

1194
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,800
So yeah, these are probably some of the gags that are coming up in the next Grand Theft

1195
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,320
Auto game, which everybody is anticipating will be a huge announcement at E3 this year.

1196
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,320
We'll see.

1197
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,760
It looks like a few more people have sent you tweets.

1198
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,960
I'm looking, I'm looking.

1199
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:44,160
Oh yes, SSJ100Matt is sending us a tweet about the whole, ah yes, Chinatown Fair has closed

1200
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,200
its doors and that officially happened on Saturday.

1201
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,640
You know, some of my friends on Twitter, not to hijack and talk about a different subject,

1202
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,600
but some of my friends on Twitter were at AI, which closed their doors last night, Saturday,

1203
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,760
was like the last night of Arcade Infinity.

1204
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,960
So there was a bunch of people there.

1205
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,400
Isn't that weird how that happened on both coasts at the same time?

1206
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Yeah.

1207
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Kind of creepster.

1208
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,640
But yeah, Arcade Infinity closed its doors last night and then we have now Chinatown

1209
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,240
Fair did actually close.

1210
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,400
Sad.

1211
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,400
Supposedly though, there is some hope, it does sound like they're going to move to an

1212
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,360
unspecified location in Williamsburg.

1213
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:23,440
So perhaps it's not gone forever, it will just be in a new place.

1214
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,360
I'd hate to see all those pretty machines go to waste.

1215
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,360
Look at that.

1216
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,920
They have little sit down super street fighter machines.

1217
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,320
Last call was at 1245 AM.

1218
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
Aww.

1219
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,320
Bye guys.

1220
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,320
Good luck.

1221
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,760
I'm always sad to see more Arcades close.

1222
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,160
Alright.

1223
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,560
One last tweet for you guys here.

1224
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,960
This is from Tigerclaw.

1225
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,080
It's a Kinect 3D printing mechanism.

1226
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:54,480
Yeah, it's some type of, it's called Fabricate Yourself and it uses 3D models that the Kinect

1227
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,960
captures to make 3D printed figures.

1228
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,460
Interesting.

1229
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,440
They were showing this off at what was called the Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction

1230
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,440
Conference.

1231
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,200
They took some attendees, had their shapes captured with Kinect and then they got turned

1232
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,400
into big giant puzzle pieces.

1233
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,340
So all these like people that were at the expo kind of all went into these puzzle pieces

1234
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,800
and I can't really explain this on the radio.

1235
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,320
But I don't know, they look like little bars of soap with raised imprints of people.

1236
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,960
But that's kind of cool that they use Kinect to I guess, you know, do that really cheap,

1237
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,280
I don't want to say motion cap, but kind of that same technology where they can outline

1238
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,720
a body real quick with that.

1239
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,720
So that's pretty cool.

1240
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,400
Rob, Rob, breaking news.

1241
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,400
What's that?

1242
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,320
JC Penney has a new logo and it's shitty.

1243
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,400
Who cares?

1244
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,760
I care.

1245
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,760
Alright.

1246
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,760
That's it for the tweets tonight.

1247
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,920
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us some more tweets for next time.

1248
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,920
Meanwhile.

1249
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,920
Look at that.

1250
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,920
It's horrible.

1251
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
What are they thinking?

1252
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,920
Who cares?

1253
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,920
Remember it's a video game show.

1254
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
Remember?

1255
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,920
I care.

1256
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,920
I'm a designer.

1257
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,920
I care.

1258
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,920
Alright.

1259
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
Moving on.

1260
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
And apparently Trent Reznor won an Oscar.

1261
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Well now that's, that's a little better.

1262
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
Alright.

1263
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Yeah.

1264
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,560
More Guitar Hero and DJ Hero download content is actually coming.

1265
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,660
This is a little bit surprising because people were thinking that when Activision closed

1266
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,720
down the franchises, they were done for good.

1267
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,600
In fact, the official Twitter feeds at a one time said there's not going to be any more

1268
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,120
content, but they have changed course this week.

1269
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:28,320
Both series said on their Twitter feeds that feeds that continued support from the communities

1270
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,900
have announced a change.

1271
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,380
They will be doing more DLC for both franchises.

1272
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,080
Now we don't usually see weekly content in these games.

1273
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,040
It's usually more of a monthly thing, but it's still kind of exciting that there'll

1274
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,600
be something else, especially because that whole pendulum pack went to a DJ Hero last

1275
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
time.

1276
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
That was a pretty awesome pack.

1277
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,240
So more information coming soon.

1278
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,240
And of course that's all we know.

1279
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,240
Soon.

1280
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
Tempting us.

1281
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
I know.

1282
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:02,880
Well, you know Telltale, they're a company that we're a pretty big fans of.

1283
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,600
Well they wanted to do a Scott Pilgrim game and we're told no.

1284
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:14,160
The creator, Brian Lee O'Malley said, he put it on his Twitter that they approached him,

1285
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,080
but he did not want it to be an Avenger game.

1286
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:21,680
He wanted it to be a platformer, which it was pretty, pretty sad though.

1287
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,520
I think it could have done both.

1288
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
Yeah.

1289
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,980
I'm kind of surprised, especially, well, maybe not surprised, but the movie didn't do so

1290
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,980
hot.

1291
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:35,920
So, I mean, maybe a, well, I don't want to say a better game because the game that came

1292
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,920
out was pretty awesome, especially in that whole eight bit throwback kind of way.

1293
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,520
And it's, it's pretty great.

1294
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,760
But I mean, another game wouldn't have, uh, I think hurt things, but maybe, and it's hard

1295
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:52,360
to tell from this story, but maybe, uh, Telltale wanted to do this instead of what ended up

1296
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,360
ultimately happening.

1297
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,800
I mean, we don't have a timetable as to when this was asked.

1298
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,060
I mean, this could have been years ago.

1299
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,680
We know that Telltale likes to adapt things from comic books.

1300
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:06,320
Uh, so, you know, we had a bunch of stories last week about the walking dead, uh, having

1301
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,840
its comic book being adapted, uh, even though it's happens to be a TV show now.

1302
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:18,180
And then, uh, there was the fable, the, um, the fairytales fables, the adult ones that's

1303
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,500
being translated as well.

1304
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,800
So it's not like they didn't have their eyes on various comic books.

1305
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,240
So Scott Pilgrim of course was a comic book before it was a movie.

1306
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,840
So, um, that would have been great, but yeah, it would have been great, but I mean, what

1307
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,120
came out was good, was fine.

1308
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,120
Yeah.

1309
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,120
It was better than fine.

1310
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,120
It was great.

1311
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,120
Yeah.

1312
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,860
So, but it would be nice to see what they would have come up with because that probably

1313
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,080
could have been pretty awesome too.

1314
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,080
Oh yeah.

1315
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:46,400
So who knows, but, uh, yeah, so that is, uh, not happening.

1316
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,340
Also not happening Blockbuster.

1317
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:53,200
This is kind of a blast from your past, but yeah, Blockbuster is going to be selling off

1318
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,120
its assets, which are valued at $290 million.

1319
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,120
Here's the deal.

1320
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:04,280
Uh, a limited liability company actually bought all the funds of Blockbuster, which is Cobalt

1321
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:11,680
Video Hold Co, and, uh, they have actually stepped in to sell off Blockbuster's assets.

1322
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:18,240
Uh, so they're going to be, uh, uh, fielding offers, I guess it's $290 million is the starting

1323
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,240
point there.

1324
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:24,040
And, uh, they did do the bankruptcy filing some time ago, so this isn't really surprising.

1325
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,720
We've kind of seen the end coming for Blockbuster for some time.

1326
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,920
That was in September of 2010.

1327
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,480
So what happens from here, I'm not sure.

1328
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,120
I don't know if this means that somebody could step in and buy the whole damn chain and take

1329
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,000
over from there, or if this means they're just going to liquidate everything, which

1330
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,320
could be if there, especially if there isn't a buyer, uh, they'll probably end up having

1331
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
to do that.

1332
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
It's really not surprising.

1333
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:50,120
Um, no, they're probably going to go away.

1334
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,920
I think that's what a lot of people is expecting to happen.

1335
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,200
I mean, especially in this day, day and age of, uh, you know, the Netflix and the Amazon.

1336
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,080
Well, that's the same thing that happened with, uh, Hollywood is they liquidated, um,

1337
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,880
to try to, uh, get, to keep from going into bankruptcy, but it looks like Blockbuster's

1338
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,040
already in.

1339
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,040
Yeah.

1340
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,040
They're, they're going to go.

1341
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,040
Bye bye.

1342
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Yep.

1343
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,480
So they're, they went to the mail, you know, too late in the game.

1344
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,200
They're they're gone.

1345
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,960
It's kind of weird because as I remember as a kid going to rent games at Blockbuster,

1346
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,480
so it's just kind of weird to see these things I remember from my childhood now folding and

1347
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,320
going away forever.

1348
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,440
But I mean, when was the last time I went to a Blockbuster?

1349
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,160
I couldn't even tell you a long time ago, a very long time ago.

1350
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,080
We're ready to get to the email bag, mailbag at orangeslawnsradio.com.

1351
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:45,560
Let us do such a thing.

1352
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,080
We have one email.

1353
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,080
One.

1354
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,240
Dear OLR, long time email or first time listener.

1355
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:57,520
I think the fall of the hero franchise is due to one simple reason.

1356
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,760
The Will and Grace Syndrome.

1357
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,000
Like the groundbreaking NBC sitcom that limped through its final seasons by stunt casting

1358
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
out the wazoo, the equally groundbreaking Guitar Hero took the same route with its own

1359
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
stunt casting.

1360
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,600
Ozzy Osbourne, Tom Morello, no doubt, Kurt Cobain, et cetera, limping to its final installment

1361
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,840
with Gene Simmons.

1362
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,800
While Rock Band has done this to a point, they've managed to limit it to band centric

1363
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,800
games like and such as the Beatles and Green Day Rock Band.

1364
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,960
Although they did have real bands such as Spinal Tap and Queen and Let Go Rock Band,

1365
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,480
these bands were limited to performing their own songs, making their appearances more special

1366
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,680
and less awkward.

1367
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,920
Seeing Ozzy Osbourne singing La Bamba is akin to having Madonna playing Karen Walker's trashy

1368
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,320
roommate.

1369
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,700
While it's entertaining for a moment, in the end, it makes you wonder if it really added

1370
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,800
anything besides being quick publicity.

1371
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,840
It might be fun once or twice, but after a while, you stop caring and start to get annoyed

1372
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,840
by it.

1373
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,040
Stay black and get well soon, Loki, flaming toilet.

1374
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,720
That's it.

1375
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,800
I think the emailer is actually really onto something there with the whole it just it

1376
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:07,120
did become a bit of a carnival of sports, carnival of crap.

1377
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,920
Rock Band never kind of went there.

1378
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,840
You know, I was always able to take Rock Band more seriously.

1379
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,560
And I'll tell you what it really boiled down to for me was the support.

1380
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,440
I mean, it's funny that we had that story a little bit ago about the whole support with

1381
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,600
the download content and more of it coming out on the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games,

1382
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,320
because I always kind of felt that Rock Band was so much better supported with the download

1383
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,320
content.

1384
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,480
And that's part of what kind of swayed me over to that series.

1385
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,040
No, I agree.

1386
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,120
And the whole like Kurt Cobain and Slash stuff, I could care less about that in a game.

1387
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,120
Yeah.

1388
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,080
And I don't know a lot of people that do care about that stuff.

1389
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,200
I mean, maybe they're out there.

1390
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:49,360
I just don't know them, but I don't think it's that big a deal.

1391
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,400
So maybe that cost them too much and ended up putting them out of business.

1392
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,400
I don't know.

1393
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,400
I don't know.

1394
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,480
All right, let's get into the FUs of the week.

1395
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:15,800
It's the part of the show where we rant because we're mad.

1396
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:21,640
My FU first goes to my tooth, which I think I got something caught under it, but OK.

1397
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,740
Just to go a little bit into stupid dental history of me.

1398
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,720
My canines are still my baby teeth.

1399
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,240
So they don't have long roots.

1400
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,800
So things get caught under them really easily and it hurts.

1401
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
So yes.

1402
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:41,000
Another FU goes to the Oscars for not being all 100 percent about Betty White and Trent

1403
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Reznor.

1404
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,520
FU to Trent Reznor for not doing a duet with Betty White.

1405
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:55,480
And FU to being too busy.

1406
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,880
Done.

1407
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,760
My FUs of the week, FU to Loki for not being here tonight, but feel better.

1408
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,760
FU to his hernia.

1409
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,760
That's right.

1410
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,960
FU to his hernia and FU to the drugs that are preventing him from driving.

1411
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,480
Although I would want every pill of the world if I had just had surgery too.

1412
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,360
So I feel you.

1413
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:24,400
Seriously, though, I would say an FU to FU to expenses and how quickly they add up FU

1414
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
to money.

1415
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,960
I mean, money is great and all, but money, you know, can also kind of be well, money

1416
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,560
can also be kind of a pain in the ass.

1417
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,760
Hey, Rob, what's that?

1418
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,660
I'm going to offer an anti FU to Irene because she's hilarious.

1419
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,800
Why is that?

1420
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,960
She called you a shirt because she's trolling me on Facebook.

1421
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,440
Whatever.

1422
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,440
All right.

1423
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,440
It made me laugh.

1424
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,440
One more story for you guys.

1425
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,080
Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and your calls coming very soon.

1426
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,080
Oh yeah.

1427
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,840
That was a thank you chat room for reminding me of a good point.

1428
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,000
FU to the fact that the Oscars didn't nominate Tron for best original score.

1429
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I know, right?

1430
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,720
Because seriously, I mean, I get that Trent Reznor won and he's cool and all, but Daft

1431
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
Punk is better.

1432
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,720
Sorry.

1433
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,720
Said it.

1434
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,720
Buttholes.

1435
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,720
Anyhow.

1436
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,960
They're smelly stinky crusty buttholes.

1437
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,740
You might've heard that, uh, they, uh, really made it harder to get into E3 this year.

1438
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,860
If you are a, uh, independent journalist and so forth, you need X number of hits on your

1439
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,960
website in order to be able to get in.

1440
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,240
And so a lot of people are not able to go this year.

1441
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,960
Well, guess who's coming to the rescue.

1442
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,800
Guess who's running a contest to send you to E3?

1443
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Your mom.

1444
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,160
No, but close.

1445
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,160
Kmart.

1446
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,160
What?

1447
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,300
Yes, that's right.

1448
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:41,520
The home of things from the 1990s, uh, is going to be sending folks to E3.

1449
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,400
The place with the old lady clothes?

1450
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,400
Yep.

1451
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,400
So there you go.

1452
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:51,080
Uh, Kmart is, uh, running a thing on their gaming blog that will send three lucky writers

1453
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,440
to the event, including airfare and hotel.

1454
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:59,200
The writers get to cover the event for their own outfits, but this will be reposted on

1455
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
Kmart gamer.

1456
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:07,120
Um, I've got to be honest, considering everything that's come into play with what's going on

1457
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:11,320
in the media and so forth, uh, with E3 and the, the crackdown and all that.

1458
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:17,260
This kind of pisses me off actually, is that it's kind of like poo pooing what was really

1459
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,920
insulting to a lot of people.

1460
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,480
I think that we're working very hard.

1461
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,400
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I can get in through a Kmart contest,

1462
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,440
but it's only three people.

1463
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,240
Well, but it's only one person or it's only, you know what I mean?

1464
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,160
Like, I bet there's a lot of websites that would want to make that argument right now.

1465
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,080
It's only one person or it's only two people.

1466
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,840
So why does Kmart get to send three random people to what is supposed to be more of a

1467
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,440
clamped down show?

1468
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,760
If I were the people running E3, I would shut this shit down.

1469
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,520
Like it's just, I'm sorry, but that's probably how I feel from the E3 people.

1470
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,360
And then I kind of see that as, I don't know, it's a little bit of paid them a bunch of

1471
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,360
money.

1472
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,000
Well, that's just me.

1473
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,800
And then sucked a little bit of, you know, yeah, probably involve that too.

1474
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
I don't know.

1475
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,640
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1476
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,400
Every week here on the show, dark soccer likes to take a trip down memory lane and find a

1477
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,040
game that she thinks, hey, you brats, you ought to be playing this game this week.

1478
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,680
It's a classic game of the week.

1479
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,680
Dark soccer.

1480
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,680
What is the classic game of the week?

1481
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,840
I sometimes trip over the game and fall on my face.

1482
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Oh, oh, sorry.

1483
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
Did I say that out loud?

1484
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,840
My bad.

1485
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,760
Um, today's game is Pokemon snap.

1486
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,600
Yay.

1487
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:34,040
It is a first person rail shooter, um, slash simulation game.

1488
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:39,760
And it was, uh, done by how laboratory with packs soft NECA and it was published by Nintendo

1489
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,080
for the Nintendo 64.

1490
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:49,640
And basically in this game, um, you go around as this, uh, dude with a camera you play well

1491
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:58,040
in a Japan, his name is Toru, um, over here, he's Todd snap, who is a Pokemon photographer

1492
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:04,360
and professor Oak or Okey-doke, I should say, wants him to, uh, take pictures around the

1493
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,840
island so that they can, uh, show Pokemon in their natural habitats.

1494
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:15,080
So you go around in a motorized little buggy called the zero one and you take pictures

1495
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,920
of the Pokemans, my Pokemans, let me show you them with my camera.

1496
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:28,600
So, uh, you, uh, get different points based for, uh, the size and the pose and keeping

1497
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,140
it in frame, you get double points if it's centered, you have extra points for capturing

1498
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:38,320
them in a special pose, for example, a surfing Pikachu, or if you get multiples of the same

1499
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:47,100
Pokemon in the same image and you, uh, basically, uh, hold onto your photos, you can get better

1500
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,640
photos as you go, but you've got different levels, you have the beach, the tunnel, volcano,

1501
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:57,640
river, cave, valley, and the rainbow cloud, um, but some of the items have you play through

1502
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,880
the levels, again, you'll get new things that let you do new stuff in each level so you

1503
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:08,800
can get hidden Pokemon or alternate routes, um, get, uh, different photographs and then

1504
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:14,560
you get pester balls cause it's super effective, you use those to knock out Pokemon or to get

1505
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:20,720
them out of hiding, you get a Poke Flute, which is used to wake up Pokemon, irritate,

1506
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:28,360
or hatch them, and then it can make them dance, and, uh, they can do certain dances, and then

1507
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:32,800
you get a dash engine which lets you go faster than usual, and then you also get this thing

1508
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,280
called an album mark where you can, uh, mark which ones are your favorite photos.

1509
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,280
Pretty fun, huh?

1510
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:44,840
This game is addicting, it's crap, seriously, but it originally was developed as a Nintendo

1511
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:52,800
64 double D game, and it has, uh, 63 of the original generation of Pokemon, and it came

1512
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:58,560
out on March 21st, 1999 in Japan, and June 30th and September 15th in North America and

1513
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:06,120
PAL regions, both in 1999, the virtual console we got it, um, that, uh, well, you couldn't

1514
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:13,240
save your, well, because it's different hardware, we, you actually would be able to, uh, share

1515
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,000
the photos with your friends on different ways, and it came out on December 4th, 10th,

1516
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:26,160
and 11th, uh, 2007 in Japan, then North America, then the PAL regions, respectively, and, uh,

1517
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:31,080
it did not start as a Pokemon game, but they thought Pokemon would make itself.

1518
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,080
And guess what?

1519
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,080
That's true.

1520
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,160
I will also tell you that there is another game that is like this, that completely sucks

1521
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,840
and I spent too much money on it, and that is the Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, it

1522
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:48,440
came with a clock, a spoon, a fork, a knife, and a pillowcase, so that was pretty cool.

1523
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:54,600
Back to Pokemon Snap, um, it was marketed heavily by Nintendo and Blockbuster, and,

1524
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:00,200
um, the Japanese convenience store Lawson also had a deal where you could bring in copies

1525
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,160
of Pokemon Snap and save your pictures to be printed, and, um, we had the same thing

1526
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,640
at the Blockbuster for Pokemon Snap, I wish we did a few of those, and they actually had

1527
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,080
a contest where you could take your best shot and, uh, you win a trip to Australia.

1528
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,440
I remember that, because we tried to do that, I wanted to go to Australia.

1529
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,920
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

1530
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
Yeah.

1531
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,880
And then, um, Nintendo had a Pokemon Snap event called Pokemon League Summer Training

1532
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:30,320
Tour, so, uh, it sold, like, a bunch in Japan for its first week, it ranked fifth in the

1533
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,920
United States, it sold over 151,000 copies in the first three weeks of its release, and

1534
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:41,280
it was the most rented game up to October 22, 1999, and it was one of the top ten, uh,

1535
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,840
best selling games as of November of the same year.

1536
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:52,800
It was really, really cool, so it sold over 1.5 million copies in the US, so, uh, very,

1537
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,800
very cool stuff.

1538
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:01,720
It was super fun, um, it got a 77 on Metacritic, it, it really, honestly, I think of all of

1539
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:09,160
the, uh, Pokemon games that came out, it was just so fun, really, it was so different and

1540
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:15,800
so unique, that it really, I don't see how it couldn't have, you know, have won.

1541
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:22,120
It was, it was a fantastic game, and there are certain people that says that this is

1542
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:31,960
a game that should have never worked, but it just did, so, but, honestly, I, I, like

1543
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:37,520
I said, they've done other types of games like this that just did not do very well,

1544
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:45,920
and like, remember the, uh, Africa taking pictures of animals thing, and, uh, Dead Rising

1545
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,760
even had the, the snap thing, remember?

1546
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,360
Oh yeah, that was one of the best parts of Dead Rising, the original one.

1547
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:59,200
So it's not as if the concept isn't well-liked, it's just a matter of execution, and I really

1548
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:04,880
think this was executed well, and the other thing too, is because of how brilliantly marketed

1549
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,880
it was.

1550
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,480
Do you remember, Rob, don't you?

1551
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,720
Not really, because we didn't really go to Blockbuster ever, I mean, I did go there a

1552
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,680
little bit when I was more in, like, college, but when I was younger, like, we didn't really

1553
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:19,120
go to Blockbuster, so we didn't, we had more of an independent chain locally, so we didn't

1554
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,600
get any of that, like, printer stuff, and I didn't own it in Nintendo 64 anyway.

1555
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,960
They were also doing, because at the same time they also had, um, the Pikachu Gankidechu,

1556
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,640
which in Japan, that's what it was, in the US it was, um, Hey You Pikachu, where you

1557
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,120
could talk to Pikachu, and remember C-Man, basically, had that, and, um, Pokemon Stadium,

1558
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:44,280
which I thought was a fantastic concept, but this one of the, you know, 3D entrances of

1559
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,680
Pokemon, I think this one, to this day, is the best.

1560
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:53,560
This is by far a game that I could just sit for hours and vegetate on and just keep playing,

1561
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:59,040
even though it's a Nintendo 64 title, I mean, I was, when we got ready for Nintendo 64 the

1562
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,960
first time around, I was pissed off, because how was I going to play Pokemon Snap?

1563
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:08,640
Well, thankfully there's the Wii Virtual Console on it, but, um, I remember that was a big

1564
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:14,120
deal because you could send the pictures through the Wii Connect, one of the few changes they

1565
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,120
made, I guess.

1566
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,120
Wonderful!

1567
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,360
Yeah, because you're not storing them on the cartridge, you're storing them on the Wii,

1568
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,840
so, you totally could do it.

1569
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,200
Wonderful!

1570
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:31,600
And the voice acting, uh, I like it, because it had such limited voice capacity, so, I

1571
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,640
thought, Nintendo's always done this, though, that they've had, you know, a couple lines

1572
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,960
of dialogue to sort of give you the impression of what the character's going to sound like

1573
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,800
without recording full-on dialogue.

1574
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,520
I liked Pokemon Puzzle League myself, but I guess we'll have to wait another week for

1575
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,520
that.

1576
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
Perhaps.

1577
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,720
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pokemon Snap, for the Nintendo

1578
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,720
64.

1579
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,760
A game that I really like, just so you know.

1580
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:03,800
So, all right, uh, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username

1581
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,080
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, we're going to take some calls here to close out the show.

1582
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,680
Remember guys, in case you missed the beginning of the show tonight, it is a short show tonight,

1583
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:15,680
uh, Loki was recovering from surgery, we didn't have time to get a guest host, and it's kind

1584
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:19,920
of a, it's kind of a slow news week anyway, and the Oscars and everything are going on,

1585
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,000
so we're going to just, we're doing a minimum day, we call it here at OrangeLoungeRadio,

1586
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,840
like the days we used to have in school.

1587
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,920
So we do have the Skype line open, I would ask if there's last minute stories, but Dark

1588
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,240
Soccer usually doesn't go hunting for those, that's a Loki thing, so.

1589
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,200
Pink Berry is our last minute story.

1590
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,440
The Oscars were won by Pink Berry and Betty White.

1591
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,800
So we're going to wait for some calls here, uh, I'll try to see if there's anything real

1592
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,960
quick here that I can pull up.

1593
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,840
I should have been doing this before, but I've had to multitask even more than usual

1594
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,560
because Loki's not here, so I don't have as much time between stories.

1595
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,660
But what we do have, what's that?

1596
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:04,840
We have, um, Shermy, who is laying at your feet loyally, looking offended at you.

1597
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,400
Why would Shermy be offended by me?

1598
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,040
She's offended by everybody.

1599
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,920
She's mad at me because I stepped on her head while I was recording another podcast this

1600
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,440
morning by accident.

1601
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,280
Let me get into a couple last minute stories for you guys.

1602
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,760
I thought we had covered this last week, but it was in our thread for this week.

1603
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,960
I think this is just like some extra stuff even happening.

1604
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,320
There is the Expert Remix and fan-created Cramps chapters of Super Meat Boy are coming

1605
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,680
for free, which I think is awesome.

1606
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,840
You are not going to have to pay extra money for this or what have you, you can just get

1607
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,040
this for free.

1608
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:45,220
By the way, the internets, which was the other bonus levels, where these two other new levels

1609
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:49,760
are going into, they're all going to be in the internets section, you used to have to

1610
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:56,280
get either 15 bandages or 40 completed levels now will also open the internets stage, which

1611
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,960
I think is pretty awesome.

1612
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,640
So check that out.

1613
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,240
All right.

1614
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,540
That's pretty cool.

1615
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,520
Let's look at some other stories here.

1616
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:11,320
Oh, apparently, um, breast milk ice cream, um, is sold out at a London store.

1617
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,320
Disgusting.

1618
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,320
Sounds so disgusting.

1619
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,080
It's called Baby Gaga Breast Milk Ice Cream.

1620
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,280
I just caught that.

1621
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,280
It's hilarious.

1622
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,280
It was on NPR.

1623
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,280
Gross.

1624
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,400
Hey, that's what babies drink.

1625
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,000
But you don't make ice cream out of it for not babies.

1626
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,640
You drink breast milk from cows.

1627
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,440
It's just different.

1628
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,680
DDR Hottest Party 4 is going to be coming out for the Wii if you are still following

1629
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,680
this series.

1630
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:44,260
Of course, this is the Wii series of DDR games going to be coming out on the 29th of April.

1631
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,440
New features and innovations they're saying.

1632
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,440
All right.

1633
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,440
Well, we'll see.

1634
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,920
I guess you're supposed to be using now, uh, the Wii remote, the nunchuck and the dance

1635
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,280
mat all together to do hot new dance moves.

1636
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:03,800
There will be 20 licensed tunes, everything from Lady Gaga to Paramore Lord.

1637
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,840
I guess they're trying to do more of a full body thing with all those parts, like kind

1638
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,180
of what you do with the connect.

1639
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:11,160
That's what they're trying to do with the hottest party.

1640
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,360
I guess we'll see how that actually plays out.

1641
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,360
Yeah, I know.

1642
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,920
I just want DDR.

1643
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,640
Let's see the fate of freestyle games.

1644
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,760
The DJ Hero developer still undecided, and a lot of that ties in as well to the announcement

1645
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,920
that there's still download content coming.

1646
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,320
So freestyle games has not had the plug pulled on it yet.

1647
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,360
They may be able to make other games, maybe even a new DJ Hero game.

1648
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:42,200
I would be more curious to see if anything is happening with that 3D DJ Hero thing that

1649
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,780
they showed at E3.

1650
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,320
Would you be interested in playing DJ Hero on the 3DS?

1651
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,000
Uh, you know, I could see it happening.

1652
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I think it would actually be really cool.

1653
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,240
There's another iOS game coming out, an adventure game, called Critter Crunch.

1654
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,280
I'm sorry, it's by Critter Crunch.

1655
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:09,880
It's called Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP, which is a 21st century update to the

1656
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:17,240
works of Miyamoto, Mercer, and Chahi, as it's on the official website.

1657
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,880
Sounds like it's going to be pretty cool.

1658
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,760
It's uh, it definitely is pretty.

1659
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,600
It'll be out on March 22nd.

1660
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,600
Alright, let's go to the phones.

1661
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1662
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
Who's this?

1663
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,600
This is CT.

1664
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,600
Hey, Dartetsuya, what's on your mind, buddy?

1665
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,600
Oh, hang on.

1666
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,600
Turn down your speakers.

1667
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,440
Yes, first rule of radio, you gotta mute what you're listening to, or you'll hear yourself

1668
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,240
and it messes with you.

1669
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,240
What's up, buddy?

1670
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,240
Yeah, sorry.

1671
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:52,080
I wanted to talk about this new MMO outfit.

1672
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Is it The Rift?

1673
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:57,320
It's called, oh no, it's called NESstalgia.

1674
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,320
NESstalgia?

1675
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,720
I seem to, I think I saw something, a late tweet had come in on this after that segment

1676
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,720
was done.

1677
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:05,720
But what's NESstalgia?

1678
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:14,640
Well, imagine like Dragon Warrior, but like an MMO, like Warcraft.

1679
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,960
How exactly does this play?

1680
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,000
Is it like an old school Nintendo game or what?

1681
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,840
Yeah, well yeah, it looks just like the old Dragon Warrior game, only you're playing with

1682
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,760
lots of other people.

1683
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,720
And what makes this game fun?

1684
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:36,720
Well it's, it's...

1685
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:37,720
It's old school.

1686
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,720
That's why it's awesome.

1687
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,720
Yeah.

1688
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
Yeah.

1689
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:47,400
It's like playing, it's like playing an old RPG, but with everybody.

1690
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,040
Can you make your own content in this or is it like kind of a linear thing?

1691
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:56,680
Oh no, you can create your own character, choose different colors and all that.

1692
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,680
Gotcha.

1693
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,680
Different classes.

1694
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,680
All right.

1695
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,680
I'm watching a video of it.

1696
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:07,000
It looks interesting, but honestly I like World of Warcraft.

1697
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,880
Do you think this NESstalgia will tear people away from World of Warcraft?

1698
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,880
Is it free?

1699
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,880
Oh yeah.

1700
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,880
Oh, that's cool.

1701
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,880
Free is good.

1702
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,880
All right.

1703
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,880
What's the website where we can check it out?

1704
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,440
Oh shoot, I have to, I don't have to find it.

1705
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,160
I'll have to Google it to find out.

1706
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,160
Yeah.

1707
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,160
All right.

1708
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,640
DT, I will check that game out.

1709
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,640
I promise.

1710
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,200
Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?

1711
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,680
No, that's it.

1712
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,680
All right.

1713
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,680
We'll check it out.

1714
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,680
Take care, buddy.

1715
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,920
It totally looks like it stole Final Fantasy sprites.

1716
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,920
Oh, there it is.

1717
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,480
Gamer girl just said in a chat room there.

1718
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,920
It's silkgames.com is where you can get that.

1719
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,560
Yeah, I don't think so.

1720
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,560
Why?

1721
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,040
It doesn't look that good?

1722
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,360
I'm already paying for something, so I'll play the thing I'm paying for.

1723
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,360
This is free.

1724
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,400
Yeah, but I won't have time.

1725
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,300
Sometimes the diversion is nice.

1726
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,720
That's why I have a DS.

1727
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,120
I'm actually playing Final Fantasy 3, and usually that's when I don't want to talk to

1728
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,120
people.

1729
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:09,960
And honestly, if I wanted something that was sprite based, I'd go back to Ragnarok.

1730
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:15,080
So I can play that for free too, and it looks better.

1731
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,200
All right.

1732
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,840
Let's try to take some more calls here.

1733
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,840
Hi.

1734
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,840
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1735
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:21,840
Who's this?

1736
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,840
Dark Jester.

1737
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,840
How you doing?

1738
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,840
Hey, good.

1739
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,840
How are you, buddy?

1740
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,840
I'm doing okay.

1741
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,840
What's on your mind?

1742
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:35,640
Well, I want to let y'all know that I'm the first time live listener, and I've listened

1743
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,360
to a few of your past ones, and I hear y'all saying to tell your friends and everything.

1744
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,880
And I wanted to let y'all know that I heard about you guys through another podcast.

1745
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,880
Oh, really?

1746
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,840
Just to let y'all know, other people are letting other people know about you.

1747
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,840
That's cool.

1748
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:57,320
I hope it was good stuff and not the type of stuff you'd see written on the bathroom

1749
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,920
wall for a good time.

1750
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,920
No, no, no, no.

1751
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,920
It was good stuff.

1752
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,920
Oh, good.

1753
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,920
That's cool.

1754
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,040
So where are you calling from, if you don't mind me asking?

1755
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,040
I'm sorry?

1756
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,040
Where are you calling from?

1757
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,040
Louisiana.

1758
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,040
Cool.

1759
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,040
Well, I'm an Alabama native.

1760
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,040
Really?

1761
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,040
Yeah.

1762
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,040
From Mobile.

1763
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:25,480
Well, I'm calling from Louisiana, but I'm from Texas, so I've never really been to Mobile

1764
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,480
either.

1765
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,480
Well, that's okay.

1766
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,480
You're not missing much.

1767
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,840
Just Mardi Gras.

1768
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:35,000
So what was the other podcast that we should be sending Valentine's cards to a little late?

1769
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,960
It was All Gen Gamers.

1770
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:39,960
All Gen Gamers.

1771
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:46,640
I have to admit, I have heard of that show, but I don't think I've listened to them lately,

1772
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,920
so I'll have to check it out.

1773
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,920
It's fairly new.

1774
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:55,960
They mentioned y'all when they were all hyping about their being on their 30th show, and

1775
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:01,740
one of the other hosts on the show said that it's a big deal for them, but it was an even

1776
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:06,520
bigger deal for you guys hitting those 400 episodes.

1777
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,520
I wish them luck.

1778
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,680
I hope they stick it out.

1779
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,920
Doing what we do here, it's not that hard, honestly.

1780
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:21,600
It's just kind of having that drive to come back week after week and just being in it

1781
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,400
for the right reasons.

1782
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,040
We know we're not going to be super famous.

1783
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,240
That's not the reason to be in this, but just the crowd that we have here in the chat room

1784
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,280
really makes it worth it, and just the positive feedback that we do get.

1785
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,880
Believe me, we've got to put up a lot of BS sometimes to get through to that, but you

1786
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,440
do it for the cool people that enjoy the show.

1787
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,960
I already approve of them because they had an episode called The Cult of Snuggie with

1788
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,960
the dog Snuggie.

1789
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,480
That was a great episode.

1790
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,480
Pretty awesome.

1791
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,600
Well, shout out to those guys and a big thank you, and 370 to go.

1792
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,600
You can do it.

1793
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,600
All right.

1794
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:04,520
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dark Jester?

1795
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,520
Not that I can think of.

1796
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,520
I had a couple of things, but they just kind of flew out of my brain.

1797
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,280
I don't really remember them now.

1798
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,480
That tends to happen on live radio.

1799
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,480
It happens to me all the time.

1800
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,920
But if you think about it, send us an email later on, all right?

1801
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,920
I sure can.

1802
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,920
Thank you.

1803
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,920
All right.

1804
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,920
Welcome to the show, and have a good one.

1805
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,920
Thanks for calling.

1806
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:21,920
You're welcome.

1807
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,920
Thanks.

1808
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,920
Bye-bye.

1809
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,920
You know, that's funny because I thought I had seen that name before.

1810
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,680
I thought that was one of those, like, long-time listener, first-time caller types of things,

1811
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,680
but I guess not.

1812
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:33,120
I'm actually on their Twitter right now, giving them a thank you.

1813
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,120
Very cool.

1814
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:39,240
1877 Game OLRs, the number you can call, or our user name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

1815
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,760
Now, see, what happened is that we were sitting there, like, completely empty for, like, five

1816
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,680
minutes, and then all of a sudden, the whole thing lights up.

1817
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:50,040
So hopefully I can get to a couple more of those calls at least.

1818
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,040
We'll do that.

1819
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,040
All right.

1820
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,040
Let's see.

1821
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,040
Oh, there it goes.

1822
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,040
Phone's ringing.

1823
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,040
Let's go take some more calls.

1824
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,040
Hi.

1825
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,040
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1826
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,040
Who's this?

1827
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,040
Hello?

1828
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,040
Hola.

1829
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,040
Bienvenidos.

1830
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,040
Orange Launch Radio.

1831
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,040
Deadline.

1832
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,040
The person's not really there.

1833
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:12,040
You can always call Echo 1-2-3 to check your connection before you call.

1834
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,040
It's always a good thing to do.

1835
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,640
Even if you're a long-time caller, Echo 1-2-3 is a good place to start.

1836
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,200
Let's go to the phone so we got another call coming in.

1837
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,200
Hi.

1838
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,200
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1839
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,200
Who's this?

1840
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,200
Hey, hey.

1841
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,200
It's Rhonda from animejamsession.com.

1842
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,640
Hey, it's like podcast plugging night.

1843
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,760
Anybody else want to plug their show?

1844
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,560
It's like independent podcasters of the world unite.

1845
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,920
What's up, buddy?

1846
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,920
Not too much.

1847
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,240
I figured that I'd rest and relax so I can give you my KatsuCon 17 con report.

1848
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,240
Yes.

1849
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,240
KatsuCon 17.

1850
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,920
I went to KatsuCon 13, I think?

1851
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,920
What year?

1852
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,920
I think it might have been 15.

1853
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,520
And yes, there is a picture of you floating around on our Facebook fan page of you as

1854
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,520
the Black Mage.

1855
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,520
Oh, great.

1856
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,520
Joy and Rapture.

1857
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:58,800
All right, yeah, I remember KatsuCon way out there in snowy DC.

1858
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,920
How was it?

1859
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,760
It was good, but this time we're no longer in DC.

1860
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,760
Oh.

1861
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:10,640
Yeah, from my understanding, the omnishore on the Hoity Toity Hotel got tired of the

1862
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:14,920
con, axed the contract, and told them, get the steppin'.

1863
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:20,800
So we're at a brand new place called the Gaylord National Hotel Spa and Resort in National

1864
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,880
Harbor, Maryland.

1865
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,880
Gaylord.

1866
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,880
Only you.

1867
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,880
I know.

1868
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,000
Well, how'd the con go?

1869
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
What was up?

1870
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,440
What kind of fun things were to be seen at KatsuCon 17?

1871
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,800
A lot of cool stuff.

1872
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:39,720
It was like, for me, it was just very spread out, very laid back.

1873
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,680
I had a good time.

1874
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,240
My partner in crime, he did most of the panel work.

1875
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,740
Me, I just did a lot of the footwork of pictures and photography and what was trending in long

1876
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,760
lines of cosplay.

1877
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,960
And what was trending in cosplay?

1878
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,840
Again, it's Hetalia.

1879
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,920
And it seems that the popularity of the Final Fantasy cosplay is still going down since

1880
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,160
the release of 13.

1881
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,160
Of course.

1882
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:09,600
I played one, I actually wanted to cosplay Japan for Hetalia.

1883
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,440
I have yet to see Hetalia, but from what I understand, it's very cracked out.

1884
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:19,000
I've seen some crazy ones, well, a friend of mine's going to Comiket this year, and

1885
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,600
I'm going to have her take a bunch of pictures because I've seen some fantastic Hetalia cosplay

1886
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,600
from Japan.

1887
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,520
Has there been any cosplay of pantyhose and stalking?

1888
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,440
Because that's my favorite new one.

1889
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,440
Yes.

1890
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,440
Awesome.

1891
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,520
You know this means I could do Supernatural cosplay because it's an anime now?

1892
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,640
Oh, God.

1893
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,960
You and that show.

1894
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,560
It's like your new, you always get obsessed with one show at a time, and now it's that.

1895
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,120
And there's been other ones in the past.

1896
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,800
But I've watched Supernatural for a while now.

1897
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,800
I know.

1898
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,800
Thanks to Becky.

1899
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,800
It's super strong now.

1900
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Blame Becky.

1901
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,800
It's all related stuff.

1902
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,960
Before we get into video games, you mentioned pantyhose and stalking.

1903
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,880
I'm surprised you didn't ask me if I cosplayed from that since you've seen some of the episodes.

1904
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,840
Did you cosplay from pantyhose and stalking?

1905
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,840
Yes.

1906
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:01,840
I was garter-built.

1907
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,840
Awesome.

1908
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,840
That's awesome.

1909
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:04,840
Nice.

1910
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:05,840
Very nice.

1911
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,840
Yes.

1912
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,000
Very nice.

1913
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,920
What video game content was there at Katsucon?

1914
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:16,280
A massive gaming room, and I know I've probably said this once before, and I'll most likely

1915
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:22,320
say it again, Dance Dance Revolution is pretty much officially dead at conventions.

1916
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,720
Ah, sad face.

1917
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,720
Why is that?

1918
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,160
They don't get the machines.

1919
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,520
Unless you're at a con where it's majority of, if it's a gaming convention or specifically

1920
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,240
an anime gaming convention, you'll see it.

1921
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:43,800
So far at cons, most popular games you'll see is Pump It Up, Connect Games, and Rock

1922
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,800
Band.

1923
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,200
Do you see people playing Dance Central in full cosplay now?

1924
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,200
I have.

1925
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,920
I've seen a couple of people doing it in full cosplay gear.

1926
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,920
Oh.

1927
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,920
Nice.

1928
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:59,520
I didn't have any pictures because at the time my camera was charging up in the room.

1929
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,520
Excuses, excuses.

1930
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,620
You have to go to Fauna Mae this year.

1931
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,960
I can't do Fauna Mae this year.

1932
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,960
I'm broke.

1933
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,600
I really want to do Fauna Mae.

1934
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,160
I'm planning on doing Fauna Mae.

1935
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,280
You need to talk to people and see if we can do a thing there.

1936
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,760
I have to think of a new costume for this year because none of my costumes fit.

1937
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,920
Talk to Rice Princess because she was rattling off in guild chat the other night about wanting

1938
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,760
to do some type of cosplay.

1939
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:29,100
But anyway, well, let me ask one more question then.

1940
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:34,560
What was some good loot you saw in the dealer room?

1941
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,040
T-shirts mostly.

1942
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,040
Any good t-shirts?

1943
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,040
What kind?

1944
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,000
What were some funny slogans you saw?

1945
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Alright.

1946
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,080
They have a female shirt with two boos on it.

1947
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:50,760
Wait, so it's a shirt with boobs on it?

1948
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,760
Yes.

1949
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,160
And it says someone lines up, don't touch my boos or leave my boos on.

1950
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,160
Thank you.

1951
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,160
Please stop looking at my boos.

1952
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,160
Oh, it's boo.

1953
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,640
I thought it was like actual, like I thought it was like one of those shirts where they

1954
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,880
draw the tuxedo on it or something, but like it's just a shirt with boobs drawn on it.

1955
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:06,960
And I was like, why is that?

1956
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,960
That's not funny.

1957
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,960
That's weird.

1958
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:09,960
That's redundant.

1959
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,960
I get it.

1960
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:11,960
Booze.

1961
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,480
I like, I like the one that Becky has though, of the d twenties.

1962
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,480
It says, yes, they're natural.

1963
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,480
Oh yeah.

1964
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,080
I've seen that before at conventions.

1965
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,280
And don't forget the cleric shirt.

1966
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,280
Plus one shirt.

1967
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,280
Cloth shirt.

1968
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,280
No, no, no.

1969
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,960
It's a parody of the clerk's logo, but it says clerics.

1970
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:31,960
It says they hate, they may heal you, but they still hate you.

1971
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,880
Just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.

1972
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,880
Yeah.

1973
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:35,880
That's it.

1974
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,880
All right.

1975
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,880
One more question.

1976
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,880
Thing they most need at KatsuCon 18.

1977
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,880
Chicken katsu.

1978
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,880
Febreze.

1979
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:43,880
What's that?

1980
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:44,880
Febreze.

1981
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,880
Febreze.

1982
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,880
All right, buddy.

1983
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,040
I'm going to let you go.

1984
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,040
Have a good one.

1985
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,040
For you.

1986
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,040
One more thing.

1987
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,040
I'm posting this in the chat.

1988
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:56,640
Um, the masquerade was great, but there was a link to a video of my friends doing a Super

1989
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,040
Mario Brothers musical too.

1990
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,320
What will Brian boy Tano do?

1991
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,320
It was really fun.

1992
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,320
Jesus.

1993
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,320
Okay.

1994
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,320
Wait, I'm looking at this here.

1995
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:25,320
I can't see an O. There was issues with where they put us for recording videos.

1996
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:47,520
You know what the best part about watching these videos, Rama, you know what the best

1997
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,880
part is?

1998
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,880
That being?

1999
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:55,400
It reminds me that doing an internet podcast about video games for nine years really isn't

2000
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,440
the nerdiest thing I could be doing.

2001
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,440
Yeah.

2002
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:02,760
I've seen a wedding at AX.

2003
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,320
I've seen wedding proposals at masquerades.

2004
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,640
All right.

2005
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,920
I'm really letting you know now, buddy.

2006
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,920
Have a good one.

2007
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,920
All right.

2008
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,920
Thanks for the call.

2009
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,800
All right.

2010
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,800
What the hell?

2011
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,800
One more call.

2012
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,800
Hi, you're on Orange is on its radio.

2013
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,800
Who's this?

2014
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,800
Hi, guys.

2015
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,800
What's up?

2016
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,800
Hey, it's DDR dollar bill here.

2017
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:22,800
DDR dollar bill.

2018
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,800
What's on your mind?

2019
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:24,800
I don't know much.

2020
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,080
I saw you posting saying you didn't have anybody calling in, so I figured, damn what happened.

2021
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,080
Well, then it all flooded.

2022
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,400
It always works that way.

2023
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:35,280
I don't know if it's the delay or what because we have this weird two minute delay between

2024
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,280
when we do things here in studio and then when you guys hear it.

2025
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,120
It used to be like 15 seconds and then I don't know, all games change some things around

2026
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,760
and I think we bounce.

2027
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,480
I think our feed goes out into space and then comes back to earth before it gets to you

2028
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:48,480
now, but whatever.

2029
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,560
Hey, you know what?

2030
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,280
At least we have a place to do our show.

2031
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:56,480
What's on your mind, buddy?

2032
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,480
And nothing much.

2033
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:02,120
Just calling in fast if I say hi.

2034
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:06,800
Still waiting on a friend of mine trying to create a gaming laptop for me.

2035
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
Gaming laptop.

2036
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,800
What are you looking for in your gaming laptop?

2037
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,040
Let's put it this way.

2038
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:19,480
This has got to be something that can play at least, the very, very least, something

2039
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:25,760
like Mass Effect 2 or Call of Duty at least 60 frames per second.

2040
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,760
So you can't do a little netbook.

2041
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,520
You're going to have to do something a little more uber than that.

2042
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,600
Right, but here's something funny today though.

2043
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:39,320
I tried a couple over at the Best Pie just for kicks and giggles.

2044
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:45,720
I don't know what the hell most of these guys are doing, but I crashed every one of them.

2045
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,440
You crashed every laptop at Best Pie?

2046
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,640
You know, some people do that on purpose.

2047
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,880
Some people will go into like fries and try to like crash all the computers before they

2048
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,080
get caught by the, you know, burly looking dudes that are trying to sell the computers.

2049
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,080
What are you doing?

2050
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,360
Not that I would know, but I've just, you know, I've heard.

2051
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:06,040
But I did this on accident, all of them.

2052
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:09,880
Were you hitting Control-Alt-Delete on all of them as you walked by and, you know?

2053
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,880
No.

2054
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,640
Actually, it's not as bad of a thing to do on a computer as it used to be.

2055
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,640
I did something else.

2056
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:19,280
I just, from half of them I was just checking out some of the specs, some of them I was

2057
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:26,120
just trying to run this one website where you can check to see if the computer can run

2058
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,120
your game.

2059
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:34,200
I forget what it's called right now, but it was a really good one and I'll get it later

2060
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,200
on.

2061
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:40,120
I got a couple of those and it just, they started crashing and then I had to reboot

2062
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,120
a couple of them.

2063
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,920
I'm like, what the hell is going on here?

2064
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:45,520
Why can't anybody make a good computer anymore?

2065
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,280
A couple of questions in our chat room here.

2066
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,920
Dark Toegak says, 60 frames a second is overkill.

2067
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,280
I get 30's not cutting it for you?

2068
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,440
Hell fucking no.

2069
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,080
I saw that coming.

2070
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,080
Why not?

2071
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:02,800
No offense, but if I want 30 frames per second, I'll play it on the Xbox and be quite honest.

2072
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:08,240
30 frames per second actually, it's not accurate.

2073
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:14,160
It doesn't feel real and no, no, I play a lot better when it's full frames, when it's

2074
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,280
a smooth motion because then it feels more real to me.

2075
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:22,240
30 frames is all choppy and I'm missing shots left and right.

2076
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,880
I need to be that precise.

2077
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,980
And Brad from Pod Culture is saying, isn't it rather hard to build a custom laptop?

2078
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,440
That is a good question.

2079
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:33,280
It's not quite as easy to build as the desktops.

2080
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,280
Oh I know.

2081
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,680
You're just trying to find the one that matches your specifications?

2082
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:41,000
Yeah, I know it's hard, but he said he could do it, so I'm just giving him a couple more

2083
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,480
days to get me some specs on it.

2084
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:48,200
He says he can do it, so I didn't say I wasn't going to buy it yet, but I'm very curious

2085
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:53,460
if he can and how, because even I'm like, that's a lot of money to actually get parts

2086
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:58,620
for it, especially since most of them cost half the damn laptop itself.

2087
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,800
You might just have to find a really small computer case and try to cram it all in there.

2088
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,120
I don't know.

2089
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:09,800
It's difficult because the idea is that it's supposed to have where it sits on my lap,

2090
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,400
so I'm playing one game and my girlfriend plays next to me, so sometimes we play Warcraft

2091
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:20,540
together, so we have the TV going on rather than me in one room and her in another room.

2092
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:25,920
That's a lot of visual sensory stuff going on at once.

2093
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,760
I know, but I've done it before.

2094
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:29,760
All right.

2095
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,940
Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?

2096
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:38,160
I got to rewire my damn pads so I can play DDR again.

2097
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,720
There's a new one coming out on the Wii.

2098
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,720
That's the reason.

2099
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:45,320
I need a rewire so I can play on the Wii.

2100
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,400
New Lady Gaga and Paramore.

2101
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,400
And PS3.

2102
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,400
All right, buddy.

2103
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,340
Good luck on your quest for new DDR.

2104
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:53,340
Have a good one.

2105
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:54,340
Thanks, guys.

2106
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,340
Check you later.

2107
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:56,920
PSDDRdollarBill is not just a clever name.

2108
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:57,920
All right.

2109
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,120
We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line up.

2110
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,600
Sorry to those folks who didn't get through tonight.

2111
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,360
You can always send us an email, mailbagorangelaunchradio.com.

2112
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,520
I love some of this evil stuff you guys are talking about in chat.

2113
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,080
Brad from Pod Culture says, I've also done stuff like take a screenshot, set us wallpaper,

2114
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,080
then hide all the icons.

2115
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:14,080
That's evil.

2116
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,080
Oh, yeah.

2117
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,080
That's evil.

2118
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:23,560
Well, at my work, we were always told we had to lock our desktops, so the manager of our

2119
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:28,600
group would actually go in and do, you know, those little rotating word screen savers?

2120
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,600
Oh, yeah.

2121
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:35,080
He'd put those up or like put pictures of like blingy teeth up, you know, and put it

2122
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:42,700
on tile and, or put up like some sort of really bizarre, like this one dude who was like doodly

2123
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:45,520
doodly, and he put up a picture of like a pink pony.

2124
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,520
Hot.

2125
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,520
Yeah.

2126
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,520
Very hot.

2127
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,520
All right.

2128
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,840
Well, that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lawn Radio.

2129
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,600
I know it was a short show tonight, but hey, you know what?

2130
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,280
Sometimes real life gets in the way.

2131
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,720
So we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2132
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,280
Dark Soccer, have you sobered up?

2133
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,280
Excuse me.

2134
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,280
Yes, that's a yes.

2135
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,280
Oh, it tasted like ice cream.

2136
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:06,280
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

2137
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,280
Pinkberry!

2138
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:14,440
Uh, my final thought is, I don't know, stuff.

2139
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:15,440
IDK.

2140
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,440
IDK.

2141
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,440
LOL.

2142
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,440
WTF.

2143
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,440
BBQ.

2144
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,440
You mad?

2145
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:21,440
You mad?

2146
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,640
Well, that's it for another episode here of Orange Lawn Radio.

2147
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,640
Thank you so much for tuning in.

2148
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,720
If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about the show.

2149
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:28,720
Help us spread the word.

2150
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:33,020
Leave nice reviews on iTunes and so forth or wherever it is that you download podcasts.

2151
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:35,200
Thank you for sticking it out with us tonight.

2152
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,200
Have a wonderful night everybody.

2153
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,440
We'll see you next week.

2154
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,600
Hopefully Loki's back, but even if he's not able to come back, we'll have some type of

2155
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,600
guest host.

2156
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,600
Do you have our special tribute ready for him?

2157
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,600
I will.

2158
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,600
I'll have that ready after the show.

2159
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,600
But for now, we're going to say good night.

2160
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,600
Good night everybody.

2161
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,600
