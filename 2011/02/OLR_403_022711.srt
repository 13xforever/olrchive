[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Booze Booze

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I have... Apparently she's drank too much of that booze already.

4
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:02,905
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

5
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I have... She done forgot.

6
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:06,392

[SPEAKER_07]: I have Irish... Wait, did you guys hear that?

8
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:09,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

9
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,413
[SPEAKER_07]: This is worth interrupting.

10
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that?

11
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:12,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop interrupting me.

12
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:14,495
[SPEAKER_07]: She's slurring already.

13
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:15,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop interrupting me.

14
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:15,935
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

15
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:28,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Bailey's Irish Cream with the last of my Kahlua and ice cubes and whipped cream, but I've mixed the whipped cream into it, so it cuts some of the...

16
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,720
[SPEAKER_04]: www.DarkSakura.com

17
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:46,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me get to that.

18
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:48,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Techmaster Loki is out tonight.

19
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,560
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually had an emergency circumstance this week.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry, guys.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,841
[SPEAKER_07]: He's fine.

22
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:58,583
[SPEAKER_07]: But what happened, I guess he went in on Tuesday to the doctor and found out he had a hernia.

23
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,465
[SPEAKER_07]: The same kind his child did.

24
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:01,745
[SPEAKER_07]: That's...

25
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:02,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Living with a hernia

26
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:36,990
[SPEAKER_07]: so he had to have the surgery for that or I guess availability came up on Friday or something like that but he like didn't know he was gonna have the surgery and suddenly was like you're having the surgery okay so he had the surgery which you know my favorite thing to do is can is confused and sometimes it's on purpose it's confused hernias and hemorrhoids and ask if they need a donut a little different little different

27
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, he's recovering.

28
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,712
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not able to drive out to the show.

29
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:42,672
[SPEAKER_07]: He could be listening, so hi Loki if you're listening.

30
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:52,497
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's probably sleeping because I know when I had surgery, granted I had the gallbladder thing which is a little different, but I slept for like seven days straight.

31
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:55,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could be where Loki's at right now, I don't know.

32
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:56,859
[SPEAKER_07]: But regardless, you won't be here tonight.

33
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:58,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just DarkSakura and I holding down the fort.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,564
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have enough time to, since we just found out about it on Friday and I'm usually gone on the weekend, we didn't have time to cook up a guest host.

35
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:07,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just here, just the two of us here.

36
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:11,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of us has been drinking, so this is sure to be a wonderful show tonight.

37
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob had some of my tasty beverage.

38
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,668
[SPEAKER_04]: It is delicious, isn't it?

39
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

40
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:23,572
[SPEAKER_07]: But luckily we have you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com joining us as you do every week here as we tape live our show.

41
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:26,953
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't appreciate you guys anymore, especially this week.

42
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:27,673
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are awesome.

43
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:34,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And speaking of chat room stories, some folks were asking before the show, you know, can we talk about the Oscars?

44
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:35,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's going on tonight.

45
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,957
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of everything else, the Oscars are going on tonight.

46
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna call them the Betty Whiteskers

47
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:14,920
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I don't know why you'd want to yell out the winners in the chatroom Because anybody who cares probably already has on the TV But whatever, people want to yell it out And I think SSJ went under mad a joke before the show That if Betty White's not at the Oscars, who cares?

48
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:26,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, look, you can, fine, you can yell out the names of the winners But you just have to change everything so that Betty White won everything And so now Betty White has just become the new Chuck Norris in our chatroom But you know what, guys?

49
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's very well deserved You know why?

50
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,003
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why it's well deserved?

51
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:30,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, listen to this

52
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:36,426
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I lied, if I told you the truth, you'd hunt it down and kill it, which seems to be exactly what you're trying to do.

53
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,107
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you been feeding this thing?

54
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:39,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Six years.

55
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Six years?

56
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home.

57
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,934
[SPEAKER_00]: So we threw it some scraps.

58
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:50,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he didn't seem to bother anybody.

59
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,497
[SPEAKER_00]: He became kind of like a pet who lives in the wild.

60
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:54,437
[SPEAKER_09]: He just appeared.

61
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:55,978
[SPEAKER_09]: You have no idea how he arrived here.

62
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:57,299
[SPEAKER_00]: No, do you?

63
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Your husband Bernie, you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded?

64
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:05,402
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

65
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:06,603
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

66
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,944
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

67
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:10,424
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why Betty White is awesome.

68
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:10,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I love her.

69
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:11,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, amazing.

70
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, that was the movie Lake Placid, by the way, if you never saw that.

71
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:19,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really corny-ass movie, but Betty White made it, of course.

72
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:20,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

73
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:23,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's see.

74
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:27,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we're going to get into the show as you guys join us in our chat room.

75
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:29,570
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do a little bit of a short show.

76
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,470
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing an abbreviated show tonight, meaning we're not going to have a break in the middle.

77
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,411
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to blaze right through both halves of our show.

78
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:35,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

79
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,271
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still going to take calls at the end.

80
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,772
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still going to do all your favorite segments.

81
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,932
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just doing it a little shorter tonight because we don't have Loki, for one.

82
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:46,553
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the two of us, and with everything we're competing against and so forth, we figured, you know what?

83
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:48,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have this be a minimum day.

84
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:52,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember those in school, you'd have a minimum day so the teachers could get service?

85
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:53,316
[SPEAKER_07]: We never had such a thing.

86
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:53,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

87
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:54,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have minimum days.

88
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:55,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

89
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:56,398
[SPEAKER_07]: We had minimum days here all the time.

90
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:57,258
[SPEAKER_04]: We had teacher work days.

91
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:57,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

92
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,779
[SPEAKER_07]: It's similar.

93
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,041
[SPEAKER_04]: But teacher work days were awesome because guess who didn't have to go to school?

94
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,282
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be all of us.

95
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:04,862
[SPEAKER_07]: But the teachers did.

96
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:06,183
[SPEAKER_07]: The teachers did.

97
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:09,705
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having a minimum day here at OLR so we can go have a business meeting at Pinkberry.

98
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:10,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

99
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, but things I can't tell you.

100
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:16,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Spazinator said that if he has alcohol, he'll go psychotic and die.

101
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:17,759
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no good.

102
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a friend in college who was schizophrenic and took LSD.

103
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

104
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Mystique!

105
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Mystique!

106
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Mystique, you want to sit in on the show for a minute?

107
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Come in and introduce yourself.

108
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, I love Mystique.

109
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so happy she's here.

110
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:34,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, we gotta get her hooked up.

111
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:34,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Live radio, folks.

112
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:35,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the goddamn Batman.

113
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:38,082
[SPEAKER_03]: That she is.

114
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:39,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you the goddamn Batman?

115
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:42,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, by the way, is one of my favorite Twitter accounts that they have anywhere.

116
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm awesome.

117
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:48,636
[SPEAKER_03]: What more do you need?

118
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm awesome.

119
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:52,497
[SPEAKER_04]: That and she's got a batarang in her pants.

120
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:54,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there.

121
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:56,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got you your own mic now, so there you go.

122
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

123
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what are you up to these days, Mystique?

124
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,461
[SPEAKER_07]: What have you been playing?

125
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:01,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you playing video games these days?

126
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,362
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you playing?

127
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:05,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course she is, because she just got the thing.

128
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:08,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them what you got.

129
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:09,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I got what?

130
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman.

131
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:10,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Batman.

132
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:15,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I already did the Batman Arkham Asylum because that game was awesome.

133
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,097
[SPEAKER_04]: But the new one's coming out.

134
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:17,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

135
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:20,059
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not coming out soon enough, though, because I need it now.

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, now.

137
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's goddamn Batman.

138
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the goddamn Batman.

139
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And the goddamn Joker.

140
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:28,664
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it's not about Batman for her.

141
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:29,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about Joker.

142
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:33,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the Joker and not the Heath Ledger Joker.

143
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, what you got against Heath Ledger?

144
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Oscar night.

145
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:37,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

146
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Betty White's winning everything, by the way.

147
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:43,509
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't care who won anything in the Oscars as long as Betty White did it.

148
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:45,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless Betty White did it.

149
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Betty White is pretty awesome.

150
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

151
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:51,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Betty White has actually just announced the new villain in the next Batman movie, so there you go.

152
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,634
[SPEAKER_07]: She's gonna be Catwoman, actually.

153
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:58,457
[SPEAKER_07]: She just took down that bitch Anne Hathaway behind the stage and was like... I can totally see that shit.

154
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:01,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Betty White is hardcore.

155
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:04,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course the next game coming out is Betty White vs. Capcom.

156
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I would totally play that game.

157
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:11,579
[SPEAKER_07]: She heard that Anne Hathaway got the part of Catwoman and this is what she said in response.

158
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:11,939
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

159
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:23,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

160
00:08:24,594 --> 00:08:28,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember certain conversations where someone in this room used to say, I wish I had one of those.

161
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I do wish I had a dick.

162
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be awesome.

163
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:31,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

164
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:37,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then, I could pee wherever I was, and It doesn't quite work like that.

165
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:38,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

166
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And, when I beat the crap out of somebody, I could whip out my dick and piss all over them.

167
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you kind of do that now?

168
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:47,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It's messier.

169
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's messier because you really got to take down your pants.

170
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:51,184
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, look.

171
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,147
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of work.

172
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:59,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look, the listener count is plummeting as we hear these details.

173
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I told them about you in Wild Chat last night, by the way.

174
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,880
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

175
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,854
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I've gone broke leveling jewel crafting.

176
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm working on mining and sort of archaeology, but not really.

177
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I think that reading some of this stuff is funny.

178
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit, she's going to be an archaeologist like Indiana Jones.

179
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:40,104
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in the game, Harrison Jones.

180
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:41,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut the hell up.

181
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:44,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe someone does say no time for love, Dr. Jones.

182
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:45,568
Sweet.

183
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:46,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

184
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:47,430
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to have a short round.

185
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

186
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:49,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's awesome.

187
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:51,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to go back and show you videos of all that.

188
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:51,714
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

189
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:57,807
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need to play for Harrison Jones because that's what it's all about is the whole archaeology thing in Oldham.

190
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:58,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool.

191
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:03,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, and then I decided to work on my puppy.

192
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I just call her my puppy.

193
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:12,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I still hate dungeons on my puppy because people don't know what a freaking tank is apparently if you're lower than level 20.

194
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:14,319
[SPEAKER_03]: But tanks run over people.

195
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:18,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And tanks also take a lot of damage without feeling it.

196
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:19,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had a tank.

197
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a tank for real life.

198
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it be cool?

199
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you were in school and you just had someone be your tank.

200
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:26,762
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be pretty awesome.

201
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:29,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You had your party and your tank would be like, I don't feel anything.

202
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:31,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Teflon.

203
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm rubber, you're glue.

204
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:35,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would always be able to find a parking spot.

205
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:40,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had like your healer who would basically go around going, it's okay, don't worry about it.

206
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:42,638
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be just fine.

207
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:43,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They're idiots.

208
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:44,038
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bitches.

209
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you've got your other three friends who are your DPS.

210
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch, I heard what you just said!

211
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:53,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on now.

212
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:54,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it.

213
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,624
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that would be World of Warcraft for high school.

214
00:10:58,565 --> 00:10:59,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put it on my Facebook.

215
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:02,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, if you're listening, this is what happens when you're not here.

216
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Just want to point that out.

217
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:04,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You're missed a lot.

218
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:06,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but our aim's improving.

219
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:11,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I've made Misty laugh.

220
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:12,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Laughing is fun.

221
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:13,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I had liquor.

222
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:14,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Want some?

223
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:16,379
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not obvious.

224
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,541
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

225
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:19,342
[SPEAKER_03]: She's always like this.

226
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm extra like this.

227
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:25,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us besides WoW?

228
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:26,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Betty White, The RPG

229
00:11:50,609 --> 00:12:13,774
[SPEAKER_03]: because sometimes you just need pills different colored pills especially the red one is there a particular virus that's like is it the red virus or the yellow virus she has the G virus so if she doesn't have her pills she turns into a zombie and totally sucks brains because brains taste good itchy tasty itchy tasty

230
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:19,420
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dr. Mario, wait, actually, let me ask you the really compelling question when it comes to Dr. Mario.

231
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Music type A or B?

232
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:25,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Music type B. B for bitchin'.

233
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:25,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

234
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I like to kick it old school.

235
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:30,312
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

236
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:32,034
[SPEAKER_04]: You just made a song pop into my head.

237
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:32,534
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

238
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:33,495
[SPEAKER_04]: A Dead Milkman song.

239
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:36,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bitchin' Camaro.

240
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitchin' Camaro, bitchin' Camaro.

241
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:39,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran over my mother.

242
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,681
I love that song.

243
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:45,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to download that the other day so I could play it in the car.

244
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:53,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Dark Tatuya says, Rob, I think the women just hijacked the show.

245
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:54,068
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think you're right.

246
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:56,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, estrogen!

247
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:57,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

248
00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, help me.

249
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,261
[SPEAKER_03]: We got this!

250
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,643
[SPEAKER_03]: The powers of the jubbles compel you.

251
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:08,564
[SPEAKER_07]: The minute you guys start braiding each other's hair and start talking about boys.

252
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:09,945
[SPEAKER_03]: My hair is already braided.

253
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty pays someone to do hers, so.

254
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I just flat iron mine, you know, with an iron.

255
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that you've got like purple and then black and purple.

256
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:21,970
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got like a Red X-13 thing going on there.

257
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:22,787
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

258
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:43,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he likes to kill people.

259
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,005
[SPEAKER_03]: She also likes Prince for similar reasons.

260
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:47,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

261
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:49,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince likes to kill people too.

262
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our new album artist Mystique Shoes.

263
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:55,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

264
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:56,877
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll talk about my gaming week.

265
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a little bit of WoW as well, but I did play other stuff too.

266
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:08,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually really addicted to on the iPhone, and I know when I say that, there's this whole cluster of people out there that's like, oh, God, the iPhone.

267
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really addicted to Cut the Rope, you guys.

268
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,302
[SPEAKER_07]: It's adorable and cute.

269
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new game, Jump the Shark.

270
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:18,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there really a game called Jump the Shark?

271
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:18,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

272
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:20,016
[SPEAKER_07]: There probably is somewhere.

273
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:20,817
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

274
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,580
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an episode of Supernatural called Jump the Shark.

275
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mystique has left the building.

276
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:25,082
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

277
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, everybody calm down.

278
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:28,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be okay.

279
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, what else have I played this week?

280
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:42,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Bejeweled Blitz on the Xbox 360, which is, I guess you could say PopCap's way of cashing in on the Facebook game, which has been doing very well for them.

281
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I don't think this was developed by PopCap.

282
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:50,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think it was in agreement with them, but I saw another developer's name come up when I started the game.

283
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:54,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And I gotta be honest, guys, I could tell that someone else developed this right off the bat.

284
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It just didn't have that same...

285
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:57,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Polish.

286
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how else to say this.

287
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:08,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I'm sounding really harsh, but when I go in there, especially with the graphics, the graphics do not have that same polish that I have seen in the other PopCap games.

288
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's buffing.

289
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess, yes, the jewels needed to be polished.

290
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:12,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

291
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,202
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I...

292
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,063
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

293
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:42,058
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

294
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:12,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

295
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,187
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

296
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:58,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I would really only recommend this game to somebody who doesn't have any of the other Bejeweled games, who really loves their casual games, who's looking for this fix.

297
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:04,569
[SPEAKER_07]: But I honestly think most of you would play this game for a little bit and then go back to the one on Facebook if you really want to play Bejeweled.

298
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think the controller thing would drive you bonkers after a while when you can be so much faster with a mouse or with your finger.

299
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:13,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just one of those games, it just didn't work in translation.

300
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:14,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a bummer.

301
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:17,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of think that's why PopCap probably didn't do it themselves.

302
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

303
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,720
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably just kind of let somebody else do it.

304
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

305
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,121
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to give us how much money for this game?

306
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:25,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Outsource this scrap.

307
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:29,123
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $10 if you want to buy that on Xbox Live Marketplace.

308
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:34,085
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of great stuff coming out of the Turnpike on Xbox Live Marketplace that I'm definitely checking out over the next few weeks.

309
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Beyond Good and Evil HD, a lot of people looking forward to that.

310
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Torchlight, oh my god, I'm so excited for Torchlight.

311
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,308
[SPEAKER_07]: on Xbox Live.

312
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so curious to see.

313
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:52,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of a game that feels very, you know, one way on the PC, I'm really curious to see how they translated this to Xbox 360 controller because apparently they changed quite a bit.

314
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll definitely be checking that out.

315
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the 15th that that comes out.

316
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be looking at that.

321
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:56,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And that doesn't have to just be iTunes.

322
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:59,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some of you guys are like, oh, I'm never going to touch iTunes with a 10-foot pole.

323
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:03,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Wherever it is that you can read about podcasts, if you can leave a nice review for us, that'd be awesome.

324
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:06,928
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on to some gaming news.

325
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:08,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into the news tonight.

326
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:10,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start off with the 3DS launch.

327
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:12,913
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS did launch in Japan.

328
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:20,619
[SPEAKER_07]: It did make its release date, and I guess, you know, it was a very cold day in Japan, but people were still lining up for it.

329
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,161
[SPEAKER_07]: There were extras left over.

330
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,782
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have to pre-order it.

331
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:27,484
[SPEAKER_07]: They were able to get their hands on it if they didn't pre-order it.

332
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:30,306
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the initial shipment of 400,000 units arrived

333
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:31,687
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

334
00:19:50,061 --> 00:20:07,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the best-selling ones, at least visually, I mean, they're not going to know until the numbers come out, but people that were on location reporting, watching what people were buying, saying that Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition and the Professor Layton game appeared to be the big sellers, which will probably be similar over here, at least with Super Street Fighter.

335
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Professor Layton make launch over here?

336
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:10,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure it did.

337
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:11,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recall.

338
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might have been.

339
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The Layton games are fairly popular here, too.

340
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

341
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:15,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

342
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
[SPEAKER_07]: They definitely have their audience.

343
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,803
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the Super Street Fighter will probably be the big seller out the gate.

344
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, Nintendogs, I think it's going to be a huge one for Nintendo.

345
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:29,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Just knowing that the target audience, again, not the folks that listen to this podcast, but kids...

346
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Between the ages of like, I don't know, when do kids start using the 3DS?

347
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:40,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe like 6, 7, on up through like 13 are going to be all over Nintendogs and Cats.

348
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think even some adults will be too.

349
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:46,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to admit, I'll probably buy it because I'm a sucker.

350
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Big sucker.

351
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:49,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

352
00:20:50,595 --> 00:21:05,737
[SPEAKER_07]: uh yeah so it's sold out now in Japan so if you didn't already import this thing you might have a hard time you're gonna have to wait for the next shipment but it does sound like it's a successful launch over there now we want to hear about the next wave of games coming out but I guess we'll just have to wait until E3

353
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:14,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I was looking at all the, they've definitely got all the pre-order stuff going on at GameStop today, which is where I went today to pick up Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

354
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're pushing it.

355
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:18,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey.

356
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,936
[SPEAKER_04]: But how about something that's a little naughty, Rob?

357
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:23,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, I love naughty things.

358
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:24,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Naughty.

359
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:25,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, should we get Mystique back for this?

360
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:27,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she's pretty naughty too.

361
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:29,298
[SPEAKER_04]: A little randy.

362
00:21:29,318 --> 00:21:29,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

363
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:30,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Raunchy.

364
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: A little sassy.

365
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:32,835
[SPEAKER_04]: We Dare

366
00:21:54,905 --> 00:22:01,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, really, it has you spanking your friends and snugging your controller and getting naked.

367
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:02,276
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

368
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:03,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least in your underwear.

369
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:04,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, wait.

370
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:05,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the trailer here?

371
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:06,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I watch this?

372
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:09,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this going to tell me I can only watch this because it's bound to Europe?

373
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is this going to work?

374
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:18,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now there's a stupid ad playing, so no one cares about the ad.

375
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,100
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really slow site.

376
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see if it's on YouTube somewhere.

377
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:22,761
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go to YouTube.

378
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:24,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see this.

379
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:27,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally have not... I heard about the game, but I didn't watch this trailer.

380
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:30,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm going to pull up the... So it's like truth or dare?

381
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:34,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm pulling up the Amazon UK product description.

382
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:40,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, it's $16.99 over there.

383
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, wait, here we go, here we go.

384
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:44,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a trailer.

385
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:44,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

386
00:22:50,959 --> 00:23:03,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, right off the bat, that sounds like a Cinemax movie score there in the background Well, the cover has a pink chair with a bra on it and fuzzy handcuffs and some high heels Wow, hold on, hold on

387
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:31,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so there's this mini game where there's like an apple and the two of them are eating it and somebody is like dangling a Wiimote between these two people that are just kind of like... It's a little bit... I'm going to leave the thing in the chat room.

388
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,526
[SPEAKER_12]: You see my friend...

389
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:33,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

390
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:43,873
[SPEAKER_12]: So this chick had to put a Wiimote in her back pocket, kind of like tucked into the back of her pants, and now the boys are spanking her in order to fly through the cloud level here.

391
00:23:55,989 --> 00:24:00,912
[SPEAKER_12]: And now this other chick, she took her ponytail out.

392
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:03,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course the chicks get to spank each other.

393
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:03,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

394
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:04,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

395
00:24:04,134 --> 00:24:05,335
[SPEAKER_12]: And now there's a pole dancing one.

396
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:05,435
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

397
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:25,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

398
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

399
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I want someone to get that for me.

400
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:36,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

401
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you candy.

402
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:44,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so those are like dumb little party games that, to be honest, now what's the uproar about this?

403
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:49,239
[SPEAKER_07]: They're worried that kids would play this because it's a Wii game and, you know, the target audience is usually kids?

404
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people over here have the big anal stick.

405
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:53,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's the thing.

406
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:56,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm honestly watching those things that are going on.

407
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:59,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all the games we played at parties when I was 12.

408
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:00,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

409
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:02,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, remember two minutes in the closet?

410
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Spin the bottle.

411
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,713
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean when you were 12?

412
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:09,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at a party five years ago where you were playing Spill the Bottle.

413
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:18,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you kind of diffused the point I was about to make because I was going to say, now you're trying to tell me that a bunch of 20-year-olds are going to play these same games that we played when we were 12?

414
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:19,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

415
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:20,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, we were drunk.

416
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:21,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's all I'm saying.

417
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:23,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need a Wii to help me with that.

418
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,011
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

419
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need a Nintendo Wii to help me with that.

420
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun idea.

421
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:33,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that Ubisoft is just being, oh, the Americans are going to preach at us.

422
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to send Jesus on us.

423
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:37,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

424
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:42,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little silly that the game can't come out here.

425
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:46,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Gripper01 says it's 16 quid cheap, by the way.

426
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:52,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they just put a gigantic red warning label that takes off half the box that says, not for kids.

427
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:57,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, honestly, it will sell more copies if it has that sticker on it.

428
00:25:57,716 --> 00:26:01,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people here don't give a shit.

429
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,220
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't read the box.

430
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,801
[SPEAKER_04]: The kids read the box.

431
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:05,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Their parents don't read the box.

432
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:09,646
[SPEAKER_04]: They expect the person behind the counter to babysit for them.

433
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

434
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:11,588
No.

435
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:13,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they get all mad.

436
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:19,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but my little kid has this game and they're spanking people in it.

437
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:23,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why didn't you supervise the purchase?

438
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

439
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:25,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

440
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:38,581
[SPEAKER_07]: so I guess it's just do your damn job you could import it I guess if you really want it I will send a bunch of American candy will this come out in Canada?

441
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:39,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder

442
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like booze a lot

443
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:09,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a beer land?

444
00:27:09,203 --> 00:27:11,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there like a Disneyland that's just booze everywhere?

445
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:12,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not.

446
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:15,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, this probably won't be it either.

447
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:23,835
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a brand new amusement park in China that is going to feature Warcraft and Starcraft sections in it.

448
00:27:24,236 --> 00:27:25,056
[SPEAKER_07]: This is legitimate.

449
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,317
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not like a trolling thing.

450
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,619
[SPEAKER_07]: There's pictures of construction that are showing up already.

451
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,240
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, not coming out in Canada.

452
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not on their list.

453
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:37,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Joyland, World of Legend, Mole's World, The Island of Mystery, Universe of Starcraft, and Terrain of Warcraft

454
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:49,000
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

455
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:05,599
[SPEAKER_07]: This actually looks really cool.

456
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:20,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a huge, huge infringement of intellectual property, but because you have the whole international thing coming into play, it's really hard to say what Blizzard can actually do about it.

457
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:29,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, some of the big blogs here in the US have tried to reach out to Blizzard for comment, but of course, I don't think Blizzard's going to say anything publicly.

458
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,750
[SPEAKER_04]: We wish we thought of this first.

459
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's kind of what I was getting to, is that a lot of people...

460
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:37,132
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen this kind of spread across game blogs this week and so forth.

461
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:38,933
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people think this is a cool idea.

462
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:46,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't we have some type of video game theme park already if there's so much interest in something like this?

463
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:49,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for real, why don't we have a video game theme park?

464
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:50,798
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a Harry Potter park too late.

465
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:52,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

466
00:28:52,939 --> 00:29:01,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that maybe the audience is just not... I mean, for a World of Warcraft-themed land in a park, people wouldn't be into that?

467
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:02,961
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

468
00:29:26,246 --> 00:29:26,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

469
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:26,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

470
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:48,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they turned the TV show Survivor into a ride.

471
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:49,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually really cool.

472
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,311
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the better rides in the park, honestly.

473
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:55,094
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just basically a little disc-oriented roller coaster.

474
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:56,576
[SPEAKER_07]: It really has nothing to do with the damn show.

475
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:57,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't vote people off the ride or nothing.

476
00:29:58,598 --> 00:29:59,318
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

477
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:28,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Great America, being in Santa Clara, being in the heart of Silicon Valley, is there any better place to build a theme park?

478
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:32,277
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

479
00:30:52,367 --> 00:31:01,349
[SPEAKER_07]: DemandGameNation.com The first experimental video game theme park and resort In the next 12 months, we'll be deciding the best location for the experimental theme park.

480
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:33,247
[SPEAKER_07]: uh visitors will be players as their dreams and fantasies come to life and adventures yet to be told so in the next 12 months they'll tell us where they're thinking about building the park dude I'm telling you just take something existing that needs the help seriously

481
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,521
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm glad at least some people are already on it.

482
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's a monumental undertaking.

483
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,464
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to take a lot of money and investments.

484
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:44,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're right, Jamie.

485
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:48,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Theme parks haven't been doing so well in the recession.

486
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:50,629
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, theme parks have been closing and so forth.

487
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:55,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really think, I don't know, the smart thing would be to team up with a theme park that's already there.

488
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:58,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy an old one out and do your thing.

489
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Reimagine the rides.

490
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:00,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

491
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:04,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And build it somewhere where people are going to want to visit for other stuff too.

492
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't build it in South Dakota.

493
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:14,964
[SPEAKER_07]: No offense to the residents of South Dakota, but you got what?

494
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:15,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Mount Rushmore?

495
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:16,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in Delaware.

496
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:19,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what I mean.

497
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,727
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to build it somewhere where people are going to want to go.

498
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:25,186
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw on chat says, you know, we need an Orange Lounge Radio theme park.

499
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:29,028
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm just not thinking there's going to be enough of an audience for that.

500
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:34,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe what we could get is we could get a booth at the video game theme park.

501
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we could get a little corner of a room.

502
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:39,095
[SPEAKER_07]: The Orange Lounge Radio booth.

503
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:40,996
[SPEAKER_07]: That would probably be the best we could do.

504
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:44,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we probably wouldn't even have a booth.

505
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:47,040
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd probably just be outside the front door.

506
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

507
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:48,801
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cold.

508
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:49,922
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so cold.

509
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:50,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us in.

510
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,431
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be us.

511
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:21,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

512
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:43,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, how about something a little bit, well, it kind of makes me laugh, because Portal 2, well, the German PlayStation blog was told that it completely supports the move, but it's not fully integrated yet.

513
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Valve's like, no.

514
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:48,783
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

515
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:51,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mistranslated from the English to the German.

516
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:57,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, translated from the messed up German back into English.

517
00:33:58,489 --> 00:33:59,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So, nope.

518
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,113
[SPEAKER_04]: They say that for the PC, it will support the Hydra controller.

519
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:11,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And that it's going to support the regular console controllers, but no move.

520
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:15,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be patched in, but when asked about it, they said, who knows?

521
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,264
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know that it'll make the game better.

522
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:22,850
[SPEAKER_04]: There's games that the Kinect and the Move are great for, but not this one.

523
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:32,684
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, though, for the Hydra that they actually invented puzzles specifically for how the Hydra would work.

524
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:35,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So, no move.

525
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:36,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

526
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:38,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine.

527
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it would be a little weird if they just suddenly put the move in.

528
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:55,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, the PS3 version of Portal 2 is already going to have all these extra features that aren't on the regular, or I'm sorry, not the regular, the Xbox 360 version, the ASPC version.

529
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:57,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Do Host 9 move?

530
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:59,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I love our chat room I love our chat room Oh boy

531
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,024
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.

532
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:33,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Things that are actually happening near you at a local game store near you.

533
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out this week in the U.S.

534
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Since Loki's not here, I'll do the U.S.

535
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:37,311
[SPEAKER_07]: dates real quick.

536
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:38,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it in the Loki voice.

537
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,534
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the Loki voice?

538
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:41,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some stuff coming out.

539
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:44,617
[SPEAKER_04]: This game's coming out.

540
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:45,658
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably going to suck.

541
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And some shit on PlayStation 3.

542
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,321
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn you, Nintendo.

543
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:50,021
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn you.

544
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:52,403
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn you for releasing this game, Rango.

545
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's going to play that?

546
00:35:56,685 --> 00:35:59,607
[SPEAKER_07]: March 1st is when Rango comes out on the Wii.

547
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:00,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a movie or something?

548
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:02,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny Depp does a voice, I guess.

549
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of people interested in Rift, though.

550
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,370
[SPEAKER_07]: That is coming out on March 1st.

551
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe some people already have it.

552
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:10,252
[SPEAKER_07]: If you pre-ordered it, you get the whole early access.

553
00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:12,634
[SPEAKER_07]: The official release date for the game is March 1st.

554
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:13,634
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a new MMO.

555
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are saying it's the WoW killer, but I hate that term.

556
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:18,377
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the WoW killer.

557
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,977
[SPEAKER_07]: The only WoW killer is WoW.

558
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:20,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Remnant Empire.

559
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

560
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:25,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Disgaea, The Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP comes out this week.

561
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,993
[SPEAKER_07]: More versions of Rango on other systems including Xbox 360, blah, blah, blah.

562
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,655
[SPEAKER_07]: A brand new racing wheel if you're so inclined.

563
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You need one for your PC.

564
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:37,139
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a $300 racing wheel.

565
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:37,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I show that to Dan?

566
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Fight Night Champion comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.

567
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:45,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mahjong Journey, Quest for Tikal.

568
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:49,108
[SPEAKER_07]: For you Mahjong fans on the DS, oh boy, it's party time this week.

569
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if there's anything else here.

570
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:54,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people who really, really like Mahjong.

571
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's party time.

572
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice on the PS3.

573
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:00,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a pretty big one there.

574
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like life at my house.

575
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:04,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's some folks that have fun with Disgaea.

576
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,791
[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out.

577
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:11,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And Fight Night Champion also comes out on the PS3.

578
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Chuck E. Cheese's Sports Games comes out on the Wii.

579
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:15,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

580
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,716
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the Chuck E. Cheese Sports Games?

581
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:20,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it dodging bullets?

582
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:23,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And what else happens at Chuck E. Cheese these days?

583
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:27,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Fights that break out at the tables with the animatronic characters?

584
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you read the stories about all the really, really terrible things that happen at Chuck E. Cheese.

585
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:35,284
[SPEAKER_07]: But let me just say, it's not a place I would ever take my child.

586
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:36,535
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

587
00:37:37,575 --> 00:37:39,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Chuck E. Cheese was awesome when we were kids.

588
00:37:39,976 --> 00:37:40,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it was.

589
00:37:40,476 --> 00:37:41,816
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it's a dangerous place.

590
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:47,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's a frightening place loaded with bad food and unwashed children.

591
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:53,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Puzzle Expedition comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

592
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see if there's anything else here I want to mention.

593
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Minute to Win It on the Nintendo DS as well.

594
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,041
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a fan of that crappy game show.

595
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of that one, Rob.

596
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:04,021
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

597
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:12,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hosted by that guy on the Food Network with the bleached hair who's like 50 years old and it's like, dude, you're too old to bleach your hair.

598
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:13,185
[SPEAKER_07]: He's such a bro.

599
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:14,146
[SPEAKER_07]: He is.

600
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:20,510
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a dude bro and he hosts this show where they give away like a million fucking dollars if he can throw ping pong balls into cups.

601
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's the weirdest... That's bizarre.

602
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:24,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know...

603
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:34,119
[SPEAKER_07]: The budget is that of going to Target and buying plastic wreaths that they build games out of and they give away a million dollars.

604
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,982
[SPEAKER_05]: We made this game out of the dollar store.

605
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:39,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's the deal, guys.

606
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:47,410
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to play the home version of Minute to Win It, you could spend $40 on the DS version or...

607
00:38:49,304 --> 00:38:59,146
[SPEAKER_07]: or you could go to the 99 cent clearance center and buy some ping pong balls and some plastic cups and play the actual games that they play on the show.

608
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:04,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you could pay 10 times as much and play some fake shit.

609
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:07,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, shitty.

610
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I am astounded every day at what goes on in this industry.

611
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:15,650
[SPEAKER_14]: People are tarred.

612
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,482
[SPEAKER_07]: and folks in chat room speaking up there.

613
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:22,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Defective Candy says his name is Guy and he's from the Food Network.

614
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:23,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's his name, Guy.

615
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:24,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he owns a joint.

616
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:27,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't Johnny Garlic's his chain or is that someone else?

617
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:28,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

618
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Guy Fieri.

619
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:32,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think he owns that Johnny Garlic's.

620
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:33,454
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one of those out in Roseville.

621
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:34,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Overpriced.

622
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:35,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

623
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:36,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Overrated.

624
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:42,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, William Murderface in chat says it's beer pong for kids.

625
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,203
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

626
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:01,635
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

627
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the fat British woman to cook my food.

628
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:34,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I think one of them died.

629
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:36,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I do Japanese releases, please?

630
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:37,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess.

631
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:44,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, Borderlands and Hokuto Musou get price reductions because they go into the Platinum Collections.

632
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:48,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday Night Champion is the new release to look for on the Xbox 360 this week.

633
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:52,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they get Fight Night Champion there as well.

634
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:52,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

635
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:56,925
[SPEAKER_07]: They also get Samurai Dō 4 comes out there from Spike.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

637
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:18,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you ever played those games, but man, there's like tons of stuff you can do with them.

638
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,212
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.

639
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:22,292
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Nintendo Wii.

640
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:23,573
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing coming out for it.

641
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:27,616
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo 3DS, yes, we have to start reading those dates now.

642

[SPEAKER_04]: More Mahjong.

644
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,620
[SPEAKER_04]: More Mahjong.

645
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

646
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:40,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, Rob, apparently Betty White won for sound mixing in Inception.

647
00:41:41,144 --> 00:41:41,605
[SPEAKER_07]: No one care.

648
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:50,332
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo DS, we have Digimon Story in Super Shroce Wars Red and Blue.

649
00:41:50,712 --> 00:41:51,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Digimon, DarkSakura?

650
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,735
[SPEAKER_07]: You were the only person I knew that liked Digimon.

651
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:55,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I liked the anime.

652
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:57,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you don't like the games?

653
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:25,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a Digimon lastly on the PSP this is a huge huge release probably the biggest release of the week Dissida 012 Duodesim Final Fantasy that's right the sequel to Final Fantasy Dissida makes its way out in Japan this week on the PSP so I'm sure there'll be a lot of folks into that alright how about the UK well for the UK we do have some interesting news this is BBC2 bringing you the news on game releases in the United Kingdom okay actually on the first we have Fable 3 again

654
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:30,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Fable 3 was kind of crap.

655
00:42:30,746 --> 00:42:31,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Two Worlds 2.

656
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:34,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Beyond Good and Evil HD.

657
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:37,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's on the second, by the way.

658
00:42:38,073 --> 00:42:48,364
[SPEAKER_04]: On the fourth, we have Fight Night Champion, Hyperdimension Neptunia, Pokemon Black, Pokemon White, Rift, Planes of Who Gives a Crap, I mean, sorry, Talara, and U-Draw.

659
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:51,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't that bad.

660
00:42:52,222 --> 00:42:53,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Rift was interesting, but I don't know.

661
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:55,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't pay for another MMO right now.

662
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:57,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I got too many other expenses to worry about.

663
00:42:57,524 --> 00:42:58,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't pay for them either.

664
00:42:58,785 --> 00:42:58,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

665
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:00,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it.

666
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:01,386
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

667
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:01,826
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

668
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:04,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Then let's move on to some rapid fire news.

669
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:06,368
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go over some news very quickly here.

670
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:09,209
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, this is your last chance to get the Twitter topics in.

671
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be doing Twitter topics in just a moment.

672
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,071
[SPEAKER_07]: So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.

673
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be doing those in just a minute.

674
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:19,454
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, I'm going to start off with some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.

675
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:44,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Age 2, the demo for that hit Xbox Live And it's getting a lot of good reception out there It's also on the PC and so forth Dragon Age 2 is going to be coming out very soon And they have announced that there's going to be a theme song in the game By Florence and the Machine Who's a pretty popular band these days They were really indie for a while And then she did the Dog Days Are Over thing at the MTV Awards And it just blew up, they're huge, they're everywhere

676
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:46,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, she's really awesome, actually.

677
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:53,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And a song from the album Lungs called I'm Not Calling You a Liar is being reimagined.

678
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:57,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be called I'm Not Calling You a Liar, Dragon Age 2, Variks theme.

679
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:01,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the original if you want a taste of what the song sounds like.

680
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,822
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a ghost in my lungs and it soars in my soul.

681
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:17,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So you kind of get the idea.

682
00:44:17,418 --> 00:44:18,839
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll rework that song a little bit.

683
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:21,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to sound just like that, but that's going to be the theme song for Dragon Age 2.

684
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:24,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Some websites shut down this week.

685
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Some community-based websites.

686
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:35,889
[SPEAKER_07]: As you probably heard about before on the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf Show, 360 Junkies was a blog about the 360 and unfortunately they had to close their door this week due to personal issues.

687
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:41,533
[SPEAKER_07]: MyGamerCard.net was a pretty big website in the community that also had to shut down this week.

688
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:44,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So we lost two good ones this week, unfortunately.

689
00:44:44,535 --> 00:44:47,577
[SPEAKER_07]: The story behind MyGamerCard.net, though, a little more dramatic.

690
00:44:49,358 --> 00:45:05,128
[SPEAKER_07]: The founder of the website, Jason Young, left a pretty big goodbye on the site saying, quote, the love for community has been lost by Microsoft, saying that a lot of the community stuff that has been going on has stagnated and even used the term lack of respect.

691
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:05,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

692
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,270
[SPEAKER_07]: She's great

693
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she's cool.

694
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:25,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just different over there now.

695
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, I don't know, it's kind of unfortunate.

696
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:31,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if this will service a wake-up call to Microsoft.

697
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:34,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there will be some type of community thing in response.

698
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:38,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be very interesting to see if Microsoft responds to this or if they just don't care.

699
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:41,622
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that.

700
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a lot of people were using that gamer card service, you know, on their websites.

701
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And I even had it on my LiveJournal.

702
00:45:48,306 --> 00:45:48,546
[SPEAKER_07]: EveryAir.com

703
00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:04,446
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

704
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:21,857
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

705
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:37,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

706
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:26,988
[SPEAKER_07]: gotta be honest this sounds like a whole lot for what's not going to be very practical but they do show some video of this thing running there's a whole little YouTube there let's see if we can get past the animation there and get to this thing actually working yeah there's somebody playing LittleBigPlanet on their phone starting it up so I don't know though that seems like a lot just to get that working on your iPod it doesn't I don't know

707
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:31,918
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, it's one of those things where it's like installing Linux on a toaster.

708
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:32,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do it?

709
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:33,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can.

710
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

711
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:36,583
[SPEAKER_04]: We do what we must because we can.

712
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:37,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

713
00:47:37,704 --> 00:47:38,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

714
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about some other news, Rob?

715
00:47:43,017 --> 00:47:49,060
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, the PlayStation, sorry, the PSP is going to be having a price drop.

716
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to go down to $130.

717
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:58,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder if that's preparing the market, maybe clearing out some inventory for the new thingies coming out.

718
00:47:58,985 --> 00:48:02,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've been slashing them, so now it's actually somewhat affordable.

719
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:04,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows, right?

720
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,457
[SPEAKER_04]: and other happy, happy, happy news.

721
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:12,239
[SPEAKER_04]: The Legend of Zelda celebrates 25 years.

722
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,602
[SPEAKER_04]: We have had Legend of Zelda for a very long time.

723
00:48:17,743 --> 00:48:19,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Older than a lot of our listeners.

724
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:25,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course we are going to be seeing Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword coming out.

725
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully before too long.

726
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:30,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty cool stuff.

727
00:48:31,793 --> 00:48:33,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, did you start off with the first one?

728
00:48:34,755 --> 00:48:35,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?

729
00:48:35,316 --> 00:48:35,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

730
00:48:36,055 --> 00:48:37,256
[SPEAKER_04]: The first Legend of Zelda.

731
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, oh gosh yes.

732
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, that was my very first Zelda game.

733
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:42,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember playing that in the fourth grade.

734
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,421
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one of the first games I had to buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

735
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:46,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic game.

736
00:48:46,143 --> 00:48:50,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I'm sad that it's 25 years old because that means I'm old.

737
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:51,707
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

738
00:48:52,768 --> 00:48:57,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there is an Xbox Live Arcade game that's a Minecraft clone.

739
00:48:58,392 --> 00:49:02,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually it's done by Projector Games and it's called...

740
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:06,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just had Fortress Craft.

741
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:12,086
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Twitter for it and they're releasing aspects of the game in different chapters.

742
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:15,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Chapter 1 is Minecraft Creative.

743
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:16,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Chapter 2 is Crafting.

744
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:17,930
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 is Life.

745
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,371
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 is Machinery.

746
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:20,492
[SPEAKER_04]: 5 is Minions.

747
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:21,592
[SPEAKER_04]: 6 is PvP.

748
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:24,074
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 is Fortress Assault Mode.

749
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says that the first chapter is going to be coming out for a dollar.

750
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:30,078
[SPEAKER_04]: March 4th.

751
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:32,140
[SPEAKER_04]: 80 bucks.

752
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:35,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Beware the Ides of March.

753
00:49:36,336 --> 00:49:37,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the fourth, is it?

754
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:38,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

755
00:49:38,537 --> 00:49:38,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

756
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:39,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

757
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:45,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go to the Twitter and read some of the Twitter topics you guys have sent us tonight.

758
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:47,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Which isn't a lot.

759
00:49:50,442 --> 00:49:51,883
[SPEAKER_07]: The tweets are looking very thin tonight.

760
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:53,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It must be because everybody's tweeting about the Oscars.

761
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:54,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

762
00:49:54,644 --> 00:49:55,565
[SPEAKER_04]: They're watching Betty White.

763
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:56,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

764
00:49:57,546 --> 00:49:57,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

765
00:49:58,146 --> 00:50:02,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to Morning Wolf on Twitter says, I thought of you guys when I played pinball yesterday.

766
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:04,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's sweet.

767
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:05,346
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on in the football world?

768
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:08,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Pentegogo's coming up, I think, next month.

769
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:10,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Pentegogo's that big convention?

770
00:50:10,673 --> 00:50:11,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the one in Dixon?

771
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:12,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the one in Dixon.

772
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

773
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:15,519
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently they actually use the air conditioner now.

774
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:16,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's good.

775
00:50:17,149 --> 00:50:17,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be good.

776
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:19,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year was still too hot.

777
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any new pinball tables that have come out recently?

778
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:23,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever Stern's put out.

779
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:26,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, they had a Dark Knight table.

780
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:29,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Stern's the only one doing anything.

781
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:32,575
[SPEAKER_04]: The last new table of theirs that I played was Iron Man.

782
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:33,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

783
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:35,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was last year at Classic Gaming Expo.

784
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:43,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, let's see, uh, FlamingToilet was blanking on our email wanting to know if it was Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

785
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:46,740
[SPEAKER_07]: It is actually Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

786
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:47,701
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

787
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:51,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Tigerclaw is sending us a tweet that is Grand Theft Auto related.

788
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:54,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've got to say this in honor of Loki not being here tonight.

789
00:50:54,545 --> 00:51:00,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Take-Two has registered some Grand Theft Auto style domains.

790
00:51:00,668 --> 00:51:11,454
[SPEAKER_07]: They include CashForDeadDreams.com, SixFigureTemps.com, LifeInvader.com, StopPayingYourMortgage.net, and HammersteinFaust.com.

791
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:17,060
[SPEAKER_07]: People are thinking that this all kind of sounds like the parodies that happen in Grand Theft Auto.

792
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,562
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Take-Two that actually registered these domains.

793
00:51:19,582 --> 00:51:21,284
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not just like random things out of the blue.

794
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:29,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, these are probably some of the gags that are coming up in the next Grand Theft Auto game, which everybody is anticipating will be a huge announcement at E3 this year.

795
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:30,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

796
00:51:31,774 --> 00:51:33,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a few more people have sent you tweets.

797
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:34,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking, I'm looking.

798
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:46,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, SSJ100Matt is sending us a tweet about the whole, ah yes, Chinatown Fair has closed its doors and that officially happened on Saturday.

799
00:51:47,202 --> 00:51:52,730
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, some of my friends on Twitter, not to hijack and talk about a different subject, but some of my friends on Twitter were at AI.

800
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:54,953
[SPEAKER_07]: which closed their doors last night.

801
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Saturday was like the last night of Arcade Infinity.

802
00:51:57,757 --> 00:51:58,839
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a bunch of people there.

803
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:01,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that weird how that happened on both coasts at the same time?

804
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:01,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

805
00:52:01,883 --> 00:52:02,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of creepster.

806
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:09,794
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Arcade Infinity closed its doors last night and then we have now Chinatown Fair did actually close.

807
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:10,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad.

808
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:13,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly, though, there is some hope.

809
00:52:13,936 --> 00:52:17,877
[SPEAKER_07]: It does sound like they're going to move to an unspecified location in Williamsburg.

810
00:52:18,337 --> 00:52:20,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So perhaps it's not gone forever.

811
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:22,899
[SPEAKER_07]: It will just be in a new place.

812
00:52:23,399 --> 00:52:25,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd hate to see all those pretty machines go to waste.

813
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:25,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.

814
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,760
[SPEAKER_07]: They have little sit-down Super Street Fighter machines.

815
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Last call was at 12.45 a.m.

816
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:32,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw.

817
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:33,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, guys.

818
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:34,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

819
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:37,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always sad to see more arcades close.

820
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:38,507
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

821
00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:40,489
[SPEAKER_07]: One last tweet for you guys here.

822
00:52:40,529 --> 00:52:41,950
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from Tigerclaw.

823
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:46,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Kinect 3D printing mechanism.

824
00:52:47,015 --> 00:52:57,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's some type of... It's called Fabricate Yourself, and it uses 3D models that the Kinect captures to make 3D printed figures.

825
00:52:58,945 --> 00:52:59,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

826
00:53:00,466 --> 00:53:04,850
[SPEAKER_07]: They were showing this off at what was called the Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction Conference.

827
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:12,676
[SPEAKER_07]: They took some attendees, had their shapes captured with Kinect, and then they got turned into big, giant puzzle pieces.

828
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:20,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So all these people that were at the expo kind of all went into these puzzle pieces, and I can't really explain this on the radio.

829
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:21,182
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

830
00:53:21,202 --> 00:53:22,683
[SPEAKER_07]: They looked like little bars of soap.

831
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:23,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

832
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:25,265
[SPEAKER_07]: with raised imprints of people.

833
00:53:25,566 --> 00:53:34,552
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's kind of cool that they use Kinect to, I guess, you know, do that really cheap, I don't want to say motion cap, but kind of that same technology where they can outline a body real quick with that.

834
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty cool.

835
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:36,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, breaking news.

836
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:37,654
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

837
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,036
[SPEAKER_04]: JCPenney has a new logo and it's shitty.

838
00:53:41,357 --> 00:53:41,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

839
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:43,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I care.

840
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:44,999
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

841
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,301
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for the tweets tonight.

842
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:50,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some more tweets for next time.

843
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:51,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile...

844
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:55,077
[SPEAKER_04]: What were they thinking?

845
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:56,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember it's a video game show.

846
00:53:57,124 --> 00:53:57,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I care.

847
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:58,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a designer.

848
00:53:58,488 --> 00:53:58,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I care.

849
00:53:58,769 --> 00:53:59,009
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

850
00:53:59,511 --> 00:53:59,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

851
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently Trent Reznor won an Oscar.

852
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:09,133
[SPEAKER_07]: More Guitar Hero and DJ Hero download content is actually coming.

853
00:54:09,494 --> 00:54:14,676
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a little bit surprising because people were thinking that when Activision closed down the franchises, they were done for good.

854
00:54:14,736 --> 00:54:21,540
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the official Twitter feeds at one time said there's not going to be any more content, but they have changed course this week.

855
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:26,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Both series said on their Twitter feeds that continued support...

856
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:49,456
[SPEAKER_07]: from the communities have announced a change they will be doing more DLC for both franchises now we don't usually see weekly content in these games it's usually more of a monthly thing but it's still kind of exciting that there'll be something else especially because that whole pendulum pack went to DJ Hero last time that was a pretty awesome pack so more information coming

857
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:50,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon.

858
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:52,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, that's all we know.

859
00:54:53,012 --> 00:54:53,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon.

860
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:53,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon.

861
00:54:53,612 --> 00:54:54,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Tempting us.

862
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:55,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

863
00:54:55,653 --> 00:55:01,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, Telltale, they're a company that we're pretty big fans of.

864
00:55:02,836 --> 00:55:06,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they wanted to do a Scott Pilgrim game and were told no.

865
00:55:07,618 --> 00:55:16,041
[SPEAKER_04]: The creator, Brian Lee O'Malley, said, he put it on his Twitter, that they approached him, but he did not want it to be an adventure game.

866
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:18,242
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted it to be a platformer, which it was.

867
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:21,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty sad, though.

868
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:22,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they could have done both.

869
00:55:24,258 --> 00:55:29,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm kind of surprised, especially, well, maybe not surprised, but the movie didn't do so hot.

870
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:41,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, maybe, well, I don't want to say a better game, because the game that came out was pretty awesome, especially in that whole 8-bit throwback kind of way, and it's pretty great.

871
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, another game wouldn't have, I think, hurt things.

872
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:53,173
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe, and it's hard to tell from this story, but maybe Telltale wanted to do this instead of what ended up ultimately happening.

873
00:55:53,193 --> 00:55:56,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we don't have a timetable as to when this was asked.

874
00:55:56,074 --> 00:55:57,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this could have been years ago.

875
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:00,496
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that Telltale likes to adapt things from comic books.

876
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:10,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we had a bunch of stories last week about The Walking Dead having its comic book being adapted, even though it happens to be a TV show now.

877
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,222
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was The Fable, the...

878
00:56:14,844 --> 00:56:15,985
[SPEAKER_07]: The fairy tales and all that.

879
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:16,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fables.

880
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:17,565
[SPEAKER_07]: The adult ones.

881
00:56:17,725 --> 00:56:17,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

882
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:19,406
[SPEAKER_07]: That's being translated as well.

883
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:23,748
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like they didn't have their eyes on various comic books.

884
00:56:23,768 --> 00:56:26,229
[SPEAKER_07]: So Scott Pilgrim, of course, was a comic book before it was a movie.

885
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:26,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

886
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been great.

887
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it would have been great.

888
00:56:29,091 --> 00:56:32,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, what came out was fine.

889
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:32,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

890
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:33,493
[SPEAKER_07]: It was better than fine.

891
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:33,973
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

892
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:34,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

893
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:38,955
[SPEAKER_07]: But it would have been nice to see what they would have come up with because that probably could have been pretty awesome too.

894
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:39,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

895
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:40,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

896
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:46,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Blockbuster is going to be selling off its assets which are valued at $290 million.

897
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:39,242
[SPEAKER_07]: so they're going to be fielding offers I guess $290 million is the starting point there and they did do the bankruptcy filing some time ago so this isn't really surprising we've kind of seen the end coming for Blockbuster for some time that was in September of 2010 so what happens from here I'm not sure I don't know if this means that somebody could step in and buy the whole damn chain and take over from there or if this means they're just going to liquidate everything

898
00:57:39,702 --> 00:57:49,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Which could be, especially if there isn't a buyer They'll probably end up having to do that It's really not surprising They're probably going to go away

899
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:57,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what a lot of people are expecting to happen, especially in this day and age of Netflix and Amazon.

900
00:57:57,172 --> 00:58:06,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the same thing that happened with Hollywood, is they liquidated to try to keep from going into bankruptcy.

901
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:09,075
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like Blockbuster's already in.

902
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:10,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're going to go bye-bye.

903
00:58:11,396 --> 00:58:11,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

904
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:17,564
[SPEAKER_04]: They went to the mail too late in the game.

905
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:18,065
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gone.

906
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,909
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of weird because I remember as a kid going to rent games at Blockbuster.

907
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:25,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just kind of weird to see these things I remember from my childhood.

908
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Now folding and going away forever.

909
00:58:29,254 --> 00:58:31,436
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, when was the last time I went to a Blockbuster?

910
00:58:31,476 --> 00:58:32,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't even tell you.

911
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:33,738
[SPEAKER_07]: A long time ago.

912
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:35,059
[SPEAKER_07]: A very long time ago.

913
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we ready to get to the email bag?

914
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:39,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Let us do such a thing.

915
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:46,163
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one email.

916
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:47,784
[SPEAKER_04]: One.

917
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:23,337
[SPEAKER_04]: While Rock Band has done this to a point, they've managed to limit it to band-centric games like and such as The Beatles and Green Day Rock Band.

918
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:32,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Although they did have real bands such as Spinal Tap and Queen and Let Go Rock Band, these bands were limited to performing their own songs, making their appearances more special and less awkward.

919
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:40,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing Ozzy Osbourne singing La Bamba is akin to having Madonna playing Karen Walker's trashy roommate.

920
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:47,399
[SPEAKER_04]: While it's entertaining for a moment, in the end it makes you wonder if it really added anything besides being quick publicity.

921
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:51,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be fun once or twice, but after a while you stop caring and start to get annoyed by it.

922
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:53,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay black, and get well soon, Loki.

923
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:54,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaming Toilet.

924
00:59:56,976 --> 01:00:04,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the emailer is actually really on to something there with the whole... It did become a bit of a carnival of sorts.

925
01:00:05,962 --> 01:00:06,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Carnival of crap.

926
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:09,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock band never kind of went there, you know?

927
01:00:09,704 --> 01:00:11,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I was always able to take rock band more seriously.

928
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:13,067
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

929
01:00:33,025 --> 01:00:33,606
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I agree.

930
01:00:33,946 --> 01:00:38,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And the whole, like, Kurt Cobain and Slash stuff, I could care less about that in a game.

931
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:39,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

932
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:42,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know a lot of people that do care about that stuff.

933
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe they're out there.

934
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:44,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know them.

935
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:47,213
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think it's that big a deal.

936
01:00:49,335 --> 01:00:52,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that cost them too much and ended up putting them out of business.

937
01:00:52,096 --> 01:00:52,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

938
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:53,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

939
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:55,658
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

940
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:57,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into the FUs of the week.

941
01:00:57,459 --> 01:01:00,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the part of the show where we rant because we're mad.

942
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:00,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Pfft.

943
01:01:15,788 --> 01:01:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: my FU first goes to my tooth which I think I got something caught under it but okay just to go a little bit into stupid dental history of me my canines are still my baby teeth so they don't have long roots so things get caught under them really easily and it hurts so yes another FU goes to the Oscars for not being all 100% about Betty White and Trent Reznor FU to Trent Reznor for not doing a duet with Betty White

944
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:54,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, F you to, uh, being too busy.

945
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:56,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Done.

946
01:01:57,642 --> 01:02:01,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, my F yous of the week, F you to Loki for not being here tonight, but feel better.

947
01:02:02,324 --> 01:02:03,384
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to his hernia.

948
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:05,004
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, F you to his hernia.

949
01:02:06,025 --> 01:02:09,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and F you to the drugs that are preventing him from driving.

950
01:02:09,846 --> 01:02:13,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I would want every pill in the world if I had just had surgery too, so I feel you.

951
01:02:14,971 --> 01:02:23,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, seriously though, I would say an F you to, um, F you to expenses and how quickly they add up.

952
01:02:24,296 --> 01:02:24,777
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to money.

953
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:31,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, money's great and all, but money, you know, can also kind of be a, well, money can also be kind of a pain in the ass sometimes.

954
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:32,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Rob.

955
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:32,741
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

956
01:02:32,801 --> 01:02:35,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna offer an anti-F you to Irene because she's hilarious.

957
01:02:36,623 --> 01:02:37,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

958
01:02:38,404 --> 01:02:40,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, she, she called you a shirt.

959
01:02:41,046 --> 01:02:42,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she's trolling me on Facebook?

960
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

961
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:43,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

962
01:02:45,613 --> 01:02:46,454
[SPEAKER_04]: It made me laugh.

963
01:02:46,674 --> 01:02:50,857
[SPEAKER_07]: One more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and your calls coming very soon.

964
01:02:51,957 --> 01:02:54,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, thank you chat room for reminding me of a good point.

965
01:02:54,939 --> 01:02:59,042
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that the Oscars didn't nominate Tron for best original score.

966
01:02:59,162 --> 01:02:59,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

967
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:04,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Because seriously, I mean, I get that Trent Reznor won and he's cool and all, but Daft Punk is better.

968
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:05,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, said it.

969
01:03:05,687 --> 01:03:06,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Buttholes.

970
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:07,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

971
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:26,778
[SPEAKER_07]: They're smelly, stinky, crusty buttholes You might have heard that they really made it harder to get into E3 this year If you are an independent journalist and so forth You need X number of hits on your website in order to be able to get in And so a lot of people are not able to go this year Well, guess who's coming to the rescue?

972
01:03:26,878 --> 01:03:29,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess who's running a contest to send you to E3?

973
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:32,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mom No, but close Kmart

974
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

975
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:40,924
[SPEAKER_07]: The home of things from the 1990s is going to be sending folks to E3.

976
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:42,806
[SPEAKER_04]: The place with the old lady clothes?

977
01:03:43,046 --> 01:03:43,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

978
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:44,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

979
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:54,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Kmart is running a thing on their gaming blog that will send three lucky riders to the event, including airfare and hotel.

980
01:03:54,453 --> 01:04:00,237
[SPEAKER_07]: The riders get to cover the event for their own outfits, but this will be reposted on Kmart Gamer.

981
01:04:01,277 --> 01:04:01,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

982
01:04:02,758 --> 01:04:13,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to be honest, considering everything that's come into play with what's going on in the media and so forth, with E3 and the crackdown and all that, this kind of pisses me off, actually.

983
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:13,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

984
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:20,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it's kind of like poo-pooing what was really insulting to a lot of people, I think, that were working very hard.

985
01:04:21,464 --> 01:04:24,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I can get in through a Kmart contest.

986
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:26,486
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's only three people.

987
01:04:28,487 --> 01:04:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but it's only one person or it's only, you know what I mean?

988
01:04:31,728 --> 01:04:34,068
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of websites that would want to make that argument right now.

989
01:04:34,129 --> 01:04:35,689
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only one person or it's only two people.

990
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:40,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So why does Kmart get to send three random people to what is supposed to be more of a clamped down show?

991
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,991
[SPEAKER_07]: If I were the people running E3, I would shut this shit down.

992
01:04:44,691 --> 01:04:47,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's just, I'm sorry, but that's kind of how I feel.

993
01:04:47,632 --> 01:04:48,972
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably got permission from the E3 people.

994
01:04:49,473 --> 01:04:52,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I kind of see that as, I don't know, it's a little bit of insulting.

995
01:04:52,413 --> 01:04:53,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And then paid them a bunch of money.

996
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:54,834
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just me.

997
01:04:55,936 --> 01:04:56,836
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

998
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:20,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, sorry.

999
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:22,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say that out loud?

1000
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:22,493
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

1001
01:05:23,414 --> 01:05:25,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's game is Pokemon Snap.

1002
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:27,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1003
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:33,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a first-person rail shooter slash simulation game.

1004
01:05:34,105 --> 01:05:40,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done by HAL Laboratory with Pax Softnica, and it was published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64.

1005
01:05:42,113 --> 01:05:47,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, in this game, you go around as this dude with a camera.

1006
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:52,099
[SPEAKER_04]: In Japan, his name is Toru.

1007
01:05:54,061 --> 01:05:58,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here, he's Todd Snap, who is a Pokemon photographer.

1008
01:05:58,403 --> 01:06:09,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Oak, or Okido, I should say, wants him to take pictures around the island so that they can show Pokemon in their natural habitats.

1009
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:16,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So you go around in a motorized little buggy called the Zero-One and you take pictures of the Pokemans!

1010
01:06:16,663 --> 01:06:18,787
[SPEAKER_04]: My Pokemans, let me show you them with my camera.

1011
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:20,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh...

1012
01:06:21,818 --> 01:06:29,344
[SPEAKER_04]: You get different points based for the size and the pose and keeping it in frame.

1013
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:30,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You get double points if it's centered.

1014
01:06:31,505 --> 01:06:34,588
[SPEAKER_04]: You have extra points for capturing them in a special pose.

1015
01:06:34,668 --> 01:06:36,309
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, a surfing Pikachu.

1016
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:40,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you get multiples of the same Pokemon in the same image.

1017
01:06:41,773 --> 01:06:43,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And you basically...

1018
01:06:45,606 --> 01:06:49,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on to your photos, you can get better photos as you go, but you've got different levels.

1019
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:53,392
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the beach, the tunnel, volcano, river, cave, valley, and the rainbow cloud.

1020
01:06:54,993 --> 01:06:58,535
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the items have you play through the levels again.

1021
01:06:58,575 --> 01:07:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get new things that let you do new stuff in each level.

1022
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:07,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get hidden Pokemon, or alternate routes, get different photographs.

1023
01:07:08,622 --> 01:07:11,743
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you get pester balls because it's super effective.

1024
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:15,505
[SPEAKER_04]: You use those to knock out Pokemon or to get them out of hiding.

1025
01:07:15,925 --> 01:07:21,607
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a Pokeflute which is used to wake up Pokemon, irritate or hatch them.

1026
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:27,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it can make them dance and they can do certain dances.

1027
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:31,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get a Dash Engine which lets you go faster than usual.

1028
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:36,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you also get this thing called an Album Mark where you can mark which ones are your favorite photos.

1029
01:07:37,202 --> 01:07:38,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1030
01:07:52,399 --> 01:07:59,768
[SPEAKER_04]: and it came out March 21st, 1999 in Japan and June 30th and September 15th in North America and PAL regions, both in 1999.

1031
01:08:00,128 --> 01:08:06,736
[SPEAKER_04]: The Virtual Console, we got it that, well, you couldn't save your...

1032
01:08:07,657 --> 01:08:14,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because it's different hardware, you actually would be able to share the photos with your friends on different Wiis.

1033
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:24,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came out on December 4th, 10th, and 11th, 2007 in Japan, then North America, then the PAL regions, respectively.

1034
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:30,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did not start as a Pokemon game, but they thought Pokemon would make itself.

1035
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:31,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

1036
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:32,182
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1037
01:08:33,311 --> 01:08:41,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I will also tell you that there is another game that is like this that completely sucks and I spent too much money on it and that is the Cardcaptor Sakura game.

1038
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:45,516
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it came with a clock, a spoon, a fork, a knife, and a pillowcase.

1039
01:08:46,617 --> 01:08:47,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pretty cool.

1040
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Pokemon Snap.

1041
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:53,542
[SPEAKER_04]: It was marketed heavily by Nintendo and Blockbuster.

1042
01:08:54,303 --> 01:09:02,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Japanese convenience store Lawson also had a deal where you could bring in copies of Pokemon Snap and save your pictures to be printed.

1043
01:09:03,795 --> 01:09:06,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had the same thing at Blockbuster for Pokemon Snap.

1044
01:09:06,918 --> 01:09:07,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish we did a few of those.

1045
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:12,462
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually had a contest where you could take your best shot and you win a trip to Australia.

1046
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that because we tried to do that.

1047
01:09:14,823 --> 01:09:15,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go to Australia.

1048
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:16,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

1049
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:17,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1050
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:23,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Nintendo had a Pokemon Snap event called Pokemon League Summer Training Tour.

1051
01:09:24,188 --> 01:09:28,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sold like a bunch in Japan for its first week.

1052
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:30,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It ranked fifth in the United States.

1053
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:34,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It sold over 151,000 copies in the first three weeks of its release.

1054
01:09:34,855 --> 01:09:37,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the misrented game up until October 22, 1999.

1055
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:40,639
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1056
01:09:58,696 --> 01:10:25,056
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really honestly I think of all of the Pokemon games that came out it was just so fun really it was so different and so unique that it really I don't see how it couldn't have you know have won it was it was a fantastic game and there are certain people that says that this is a game that should have never worked but it just did

1057
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:36,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but honestly, like I said, they've done other types of games like this that just did not do very well.

1058
01:10:37,384 --> 01:10:43,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, remember the Africa taking pictures of animals thing?

1059
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:49,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dead Rising even had the snap thing, remember?

1060
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:49,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1061
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:51,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that was one of the best parts of Dead or Rising, the original one.

1062
01:10:52,304 --> 01:10:56,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not as if the concept isn't well liked.

1063
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,653
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of execution.

1064
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:00,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really think this was executed well.

1065
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:05,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing too is because of how brilliantly marketed it was.

1066
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:07,024
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember, Rob, don't you?

1067
01:11:07,384 --> 01:11:09,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, because we didn't really go to Blockbuster ever.

1068
01:11:09,705 --> 01:11:15,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I did go there a little bit when I was more in college, but when I was younger, we didn't really go to Blockbuster.

1069
01:11:16,089 --> 01:11:21,092
[SPEAKER_07]: We had more of an independent chain locally, so we didn't get any of that printer stuff.

1070
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:22,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't own a Nintendo 64 anyway.

1071
01:11:22,593 --> 01:11:29,576
[SPEAKER_04]: They were also doing, because at the same time, they also had the Pikachu Genkidichu, which in Japan, that's what it was.

1072
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:31,698
[SPEAKER_04]: In the U.S., it was Hey, you Pikachu.

1073
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:35,840
[SPEAKER_04]: You could talk to Pikachu and remember Seaman basically had that.

1074
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pokemon Stadium, which I thought was a fantastic concept.

1075
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:47,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one of the 3D entrances of Pokemon, I think this one to this day is the best.

1076
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:55,871
[SPEAKER_04]: This is by far a game that I could just sit for hours and vegetate on and just keep playing, even though it's a Nintendo 64 title.

1077
01:11:56,071 --> 01:12:02,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when we got referred to Nintendo 64 the first time around, I was pissed off because how was I going to play Pokemon Snap?

1078
01:12:02,355 --> 01:12:05,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thankfully, there's the Wii Virtual Console one.

1079
01:12:05,756 --> 01:12:07,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, we also got it again.

1080
01:12:07,397 --> 01:12:11,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But I remember that was a big deal because you could send the pictures through the Wii Connect.

1081
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:11,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1082
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,002
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the few changes they made, I guess.

1083
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:15,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

1084
01:12:15,962 --> 01:12:20,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because you're not storing them on the cartridge, you're storing them on your Wii, so you totally could be wrong.

1085
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And the voice acting.

1086
01:12:25,902 --> 01:12:29,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it had such limited voice capacity.

1087
01:12:30,585 --> 01:12:34,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's always done this, though.

1088
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:43,414
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had a couple of lines of dialogue to give you the impression of what the character's going to sound like without recording full-on dialogue.

1089
01:12:43,954 --> 01:12:45,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked Pokemon Puzzle League myself.

1090
01:12:46,256 --> 01:12:47,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess we'll have to wait another week for that.

1091
01:12:48,517 --> 01:12:48,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps.

1092
01:12:50,427 --> 01:12:58,012
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pokemon Snap for the Nintendo 64, a game that I really like, just so you know.

1093
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1094
01:13:05,617 --> 01:13:07,659
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take some calls here to close out the show.

1095
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:11,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, guys, in case you missed the beginning of the show tonight, it is a short show tonight.

1096
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki was recovering from surgery.

1097
01:13:14,003 --> 01:13:19,807
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have time to get a guest host, and it's kind of a slow news week anyway, and the Oscars and everything are going on.

1098
01:13:20,487 --> 01:13:25,209
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a minimum day, we call it here at Orange Launch Radio, like the days we used to have in school.

1099
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:27,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have the Skype line open.

1100
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:31,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I would ask if there's last minute stories, but DarkSakura usually doesn't go hunting for those.

1101
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:33,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinkberry is our last minute story.

1102
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:38,013
[SPEAKER_04]: The Oscars were won by Pinkberry and Betty White.

1103
01:13:39,413 --> 01:13:41,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to wait for some calls here.

1104
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:44,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to see if there's anything real quick here that I can pull up.

1105
01:13:46,044 --> 01:13:53,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have been doing this before, but I've had to multitask even more than usual because Loki's not here, so I don't have as much time between stories.

1106
01:13:54,286 --> 01:13:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we do have... What's that?

1107
01:13:57,627 --> 01:14:03,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Shermie, who is laying at your feet loyally, looking offended at you.

1108
01:14:04,469 --> 01:14:06,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would Shermie be offended by me?

1109
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,430
[SPEAKER_04]: She's offended by everybody.

1110
01:14:08,951 --> 01:14:13,632
[SPEAKER_04]: She's mad at me because I stepped on her head while I was recording another podcast this morning by accident.

1111
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:17,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get into a couple last-minute stories for you guys.

1112
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:21,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we had covered this last week, but it was in our thread for this week.

1113
01:14:21,811 --> 01:14:23,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is just like some extra stuff even happening.

1114
01:14:24,873 --> 01:14:33,016
[SPEAKER_07]: There is the Expert Remix and fan-created Kramps chapters of Super Meat Boy are coming for free, which I think is awesome.

1115
01:14:33,657 --> 01:14:36,798
[SPEAKER_07]: You are not going to have to pay extra money for this or what have you.

1116
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:38,679
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just get this for free.

1117
01:14:39,019 --> 01:15:05,792
[SPEAKER_07]: by the way the internets which was the other bonus levels where these two other new levels are going into they're all going to be in the internets section you used to have to get either 15 bandages or 40 completed levels now will also open the internets stage which I think is pretty awesome so check that out alright that's pretty cool let's look at some other stories here

1118
01:15:06,863 --> 01:15:10,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, apparently breast milk ice cream is sold out at a London store.

1119
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:11,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Disgusting.

1120
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:13,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds so disgusting.

1121
01:15:13,049 --> 01:15:15,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Baby Gaga Breast Milk Ice Cream.

1122
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:18,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I just caught that.

1123
01:15:18,154 --> 01:15:19,015
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hilarious.

1124
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:19,715
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on NPR.

1125
01:15:20,656 --> 01:15:21,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross.

1126
01:15:22,028 --> 01:15:23,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that's what babies drink.

1127
01:15:24,329 --> 01:15:26,971
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't make ice cream out of it for not babies.

1128
01:15:26,991 --> 01:15:28,692
[SPEAKER_04]: You drink breast milk from cows.

1129
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:30,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just different.

1130
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,895
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Hottest Party 4 is going to be coming out for the Wii.

1131
01:15:35,475 --> 01:15:40,458
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are still following this series, of course, this is the Wii series of DDR games.

1132
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:44,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, gonna be coming out on the 29th of April.

1133
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,501
[SPEAKER_07]: New features and innovations, they're saying.

1134
01:15:46,581 --> 01:15:47,602
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we'll see.

1135
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:56,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you're supposed to be using now the Wii Remote, the Nunchuck, and the Dance Mat all together to do hot new dance moves.

1136
01:15:56,628 --> 01:16:01,431
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be 20 licensed tunes, everything from Lady Gaga to Paramore.

1137
01:16:01,971 --> 01:16:02,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Lord.

1138
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:04,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want DDR.

1139
01:16:19,629 --> 01:16:47,510
[SPEAKER_07]: uh let's see the fate of Freestyle Games the DJ Hero developer still undecided uh and a lot of that ties in as well to the announcement that there's still download content coming so Freestyle Games has not had the plug pulled on it yet uh they may be able to make other games maybe even a new DJ Hero game I would be more curious to see if anything is happening with that uh 3D DJ Hero thing that they showed at uh E3 would you be interested in playing DJ Hero on the 3DS?

1140
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,021
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I could see it happening.

1141
01:16:51,081 --> 01:16:52,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would actually be really cool.

1142
01:16:53,883 --> 01:17:00,048
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another iOS game coming out, an adventure game, called Critter Crunch.

1143
01:17:00,368 --> 01:17:01,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it's by Critter Crunch.

1144
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:13,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP, which is a 21st century update to the works of Miyamoto, Mercer, and Chahi.

1145
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:17,062
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the official website.

1146
01:17:18,363 --> 01:17:19,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it's going to be pretty cool.

1147
01:17:19,804 --> 01:17:21,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely is pretty.

1148
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:24,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be out on March 22nd.

1149
01:17:26,286 --> 01:17:27,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

1150
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:29,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1151
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:29,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1152
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:32,027
[SPEAKER_07]: It's PT.

1153
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Dark Tattoo, what's on your mind, buddy?

1154
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn down your speakers.

1155
01:17:38,009 --> 01:17:42,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, first rule of radio, you've got to mute what you're listening to or you'll hear yourself and it messes with you.

1156
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:43,671
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, buddy?

1157
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:44,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

1158
01:17:45,671 --> 01:17:46,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to talk about this...

1159
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:48,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Warrior, Warcraft

1160
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:15,931
[SPEAKER_07]: How exactly does this play?

1161
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:18,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it like an old school Nintendo game or what?

1162
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:24,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks just like the old Dragon Warrior game, only you're playing with lots of other people.

1163
01:18:27,755 --> 01:18:28,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And what makes this game fun?

1164
01:18:31,576 --> 01:18:37,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's... It's... It's old school.

1165
01:18:37,878 --> 01:18:39,178
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's awesome.

1166
01:18:40,278 --> 01:18:40,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1167
01:18:40,658 --> 01:18:42,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like playing...

1168
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:46,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like playing an old RPG, but with everybody.

1169
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:50,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you make your own content in this, or is it kind of a linear thing?

1170
01:18:52,203 --> 01:18:53,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, you can create your own character.

1171
01:18:54,845 --> 01:18:56,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Choose different colors and all that.

1172
01:18:56,886 --> 01:18:57,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

1173
01:18:57,326 --> 01:18:58,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Different classes.

1174
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm watching a video of it.

1175
01:18:59,947 --> 01:19:05,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks interesting, but honestly, I like World of Warcraft.

1176
01:19:07,031 --> 01:19:10,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think this NESstalgia will tear people away from World of Warcraft?

1177
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:11,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it free?

1178
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:13,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1179
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:15,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's cool.

1180
01:19:15,382 --> 01:19:15,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Free is good.

1181
01:19:15,942 --> 01:19:16,122
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1182
01:19:16,142 --> 01:19:17,383
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the website where we can check it out?

1183
01:19:19,705 --> 01:19:20,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shoot.

1184
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to find it.

1185
01:19:22,548 --> 01:19:24,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to Google it to find out.

1186
01:19:26,231 --> 01:19:26,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1187
01:19:26,591 --> 01:19:26,911
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1188
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:28,673
[SPEAKER_07]: DT, I will check that game out.

1189
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:29,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise.

1190
01:19:29,273 --> 01:19:30,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?

1191
01:19:32,196 --> 01:19:32,856
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's it.

1192
01:19:33,077 --> 01:19:33,417
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1193
01:19:33,437 --> 01:19:34,097
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll check it out.

1194
01:19:34,197 --> 01:19:34,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

1195
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: It totally looks like it stole Final Fantasy sprites.

1196
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:38,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there it is.

1197
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:43,091
[SPEAKER_07]: GamerGirl just said in a chat room there it's SilkGames.com is where you can get that.

1198
01:19:44,972 --> 01:19:45,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think so.

1199
01:19:48,535 --> 01:19:48,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1200
01:19:48,755 --> 01:19:49,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it look that good?

1201
01:19:50,136 --> 01:19:52,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already paying for something so I'll play the thing I'm paying for.

1202
01:19:52,317 --> 01:19:52,598
[SPEAKER_04]: This is free.

1203
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I won't have time.

1204
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes a diversion is nice.

1205
01:19:57,221 --> 01:19:58,262
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I have a DS.

1206
01:19:59,823 --> 01:20:03,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually playing Final Fantasy 3 and usually that's when I don't want to talk to people.

1207
01:20:05,745 --> 01:20:08,766
[SPEAKER_04]: and honestly, if I wanted something that was sprite based, I'd go back to Ragnarok.

1208
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:12,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I can play that for free too.

1209
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:14,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks better.

1210
01:20:16,648 --> 01:20:18,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's try to take some more calls here.

1211
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:19,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1212
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:20,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1213
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Dark Chester, how you doing?

1214
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:23,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, good.

1215
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:24,471
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, buddy?

1216
01:20:25,811 --> 01:20:26,572
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing okay.

1217
01:20:26,732 --> 01:20:27,212
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

1218
01:20:28,832 --> 01:20:32,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I wanted to let y'all know that I'm the first time live listener.

1219
01:20:32,533 --> 01:20:32,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

1220
01:20:33,694 --> 01:20:34,354
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um,

1221
01:20:35,006 --> 01:20:40,148
[SPEAKER_15]: I've listened to a few of your past ones and I hear y'all saying to tell your friends and everything.

1222
01:20:40,248 --> 01:20:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1223
01:20:41,268 --> 01:20:46,230
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to let y'all know that I heard about you guys through another podcast.

1224
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:47,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

1225
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:51,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to let y'all know, other people are letting other people know about you.

1226
01:20:52,151 --> 01:20:52,772
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1227
01:20:52,832 --> 01:20:58,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it was good stuff and not like the type of stuff you'd see written on the bathroom wall for a good time.

1228
01:20:58,753 --> 01:20:59,874
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, no.

1229
01:21:00,054 --> 01:21:00,954
[SPEAKER_15]: It was good stuff.

1230
01:21:01,194 --> 01:21:01,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

1231
01:21:01,394 --> 01:21:01,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1232
01:21:01,754 --> 01:21:03,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So where are you calling from if you don't mind me asking?

1233
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:05,554
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry?

1234
01:21:05,654 --> 01:21:06,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you calling from?

1235
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:09,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Louisiana.

1236
01:21:10,218 --> 01:21:10,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1237
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:13,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm an Alabama native.

1238
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:15,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1239
01:21:16,002 --> 01:21:16,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm from Mobile.

1240
01:21:18,844 --> 01:21:22,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm calling from Louisiana, but I'm from Texas.

1241
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

1242
01:21:24,408 --> 01:21:26,129
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never really been to Mobile either.

1243
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:27,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's okay.

1244
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:27,910
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not missing much.

1245
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:29,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Mardi Gras.

1246
01:21:29,832 --> 01:21:34,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So what was the other podcast that we should be sending Valentine's cards to a little late?

1247
01:21:37,112 --> 01:21:38,212
[SPEAKER_15]: It was AllGenGamers.

1248
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:39,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fairly new.

1249
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:46,798
[SPEAKER_07]: They mentioned y'all when they were all hyping about their being on their 30th show, and one of the other hosts on the show said that it's

1250
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:01,121
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1251
01:22:14,839 --> 01:22:23,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of having that drive to come back week after week and just being in it for the right reasons.

1252
01:22:23,365 --> 01:22:24,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We know we're not going to be super famous.

1253
01:22:24,926 --> 01:22:26,207
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the reason to be in this.

1254
01:22:26,247 --> 01:22:30,150
[SPEAKER_07]: But just the crowd that we have here in the chat room really makes it worth it.

1255
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:32,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the positive feedback that we do get.

1256
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:36,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe me, we got to put up a lot of BS sometimes to kind of get through to that.

1257
01:22:36,654 --> 01:22:42,198
[SPEAKER_07]: But you do it for the cool people that enjoy the show.

1258
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:42,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1259
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:47,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I already approve of them because I had an episode called The Cult of Snuggie with the dog Snuggie.

1260
01:22:47,818 --> 01:22:50,061
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a great episode.

1261
01:22:50,261 --> 01:22:51,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty awesome.

1262
01:22:51,362 --> 01:22:54,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shout out to those guys and a big thank you.

1263
01:22:54,245 --> 01:22:54,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And 370 to go.

1264
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:56,027
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it.

1265
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:59,051
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1266
01:22:59,151 --> 01:22:59,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1267
01:23:00,692 --> 01:23:02,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dark Jester?

1268
01:23:04,436 --> 01:23:33,401
[SPEAKER_07]: not that I can think of I had a couple of things but they just kind of flew out of my brain I don't really remember them now that tends to happen on live radio happens to me all the time but if you think about it send us an email later on alright I sure can alright welcome to the show and have a good one thanks for calling you're welcome bye bye you know that's funny because I thought I had seen that name before I thought that was one of those like long time listener first time caller types of things but I guess not I'm actually I'm on their Twitter right now giving them a thank you very cool

[SPEAKER_07]: Deadline.

1272
01:24:06,986 --> 01:24:07,966
[SPEAKER_07]: That person's not really there.

1273
01:24:08,367 --> 01:24:12,009
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always call Echo 1-2-3 to check your connection before you call.

1274
01:24:12,049 --> 01:24:12,929
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always a good thing to do.

1275
01:24:13,069 --> 01:24:16,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you're a long-time caller, Echo 1-2-3 is a good place to start.

1276
01:24:16,572 --> 01:24:18,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the phone so we got another call coming in.

1277
01:24:18,313 --> 01:24:19,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1278
01:24:19,093 --> 01:24:19,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1279
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:22,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma from AnimeJamSession.com.

1280
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,176
[SPEAKER_06]: How you guys doing?

1281
01:24:23,436 --> 01:24:25,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's like podcast plugging night.

1282
01:24:25,637 --> 01:24:26,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else want to plug their show?

1283
01:24:27,738 --> 01:24:30,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like independent podcasters of the world unite.

1284
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:32,001
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, buddy?

1285
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:33,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too much.

1286
01:24:33,531 --> 01:24:38,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured that I'd rest and relax so I can give you my KatsuCon17 con report.

1287
01:24:39,038 --> 01:24:40,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, KatsuCon17.

1288
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to KatsuCon13, I think.

1289
01:24:45,928 --> 01:24:52,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it might have been 15, and yes, there is a picture of you floating around on our Facebook fan page of you as the Black Mage.

1290
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:53,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, great.

1291
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:54,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Joy and Rapture.

1292
01:24:55,016 --> 01:24:58,459
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, yeah, I remember KatsuCon way out there in snowy D.C.

1293
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,220
[SPEAKER_07]: How was it?

1294
01:24:59,921 --> 01:25:02,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good, but this time we're no longer in D.C.

1295
01:25:02,883 --> 01:25:03,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1296
01:25:04,745 --> 01:25:11,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, from my understanding, the Omnishorm, the Hoity Toity Hotel, got tired of the con.

1297
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:14,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Acta Contracta told them, get the step in.

1298
01:25:14,872 --> 01:25:21,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're at a brand new place called the Gaylord National Hotel, Spa and Resort in National Harbor, Maryland.

1299
01:25:22,798 --> 01:25:23,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaylord.

1300
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:25,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Only you.

1301
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1302
01:25:27,895 --> 01:25:29,055
[SPEAKER_07]: What was trending in cosplay?

1303
01:25:29,115 --> 01:25:29,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's Hetalia

1304
01:25:55,756 --> 01:26:02,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems that the popularity of the Final Fantasy cosplay is still going down since the release of XIII.

1305
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:02,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1306
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:08,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I wanted to cosplay Japan for Hitalia.

1307
01:26:09,723 --> 01:26:12,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I've yet to see Hitalia, but from what I understand, it's very cracked out.

1308
01:26:13,608 --> 01:26:15,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen some crazy ones.

1309
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:17,992
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine is going to Comiket this year.

1310
01:26:19,713 --> 01:26:24,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have her take a bunch of pictures because I've seen some fantastic Hetalia cosplay from Japan.

1311
01:26:24,376 --> 01:26:26,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Has there been any cosplay of pantyhose and stocking?

1312
01:26:26,498 --> 01:26:27,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's my favorite new one.

1313
01:26:28,459 --> 01:26:28,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1314
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:29,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1315
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:32,922
[SPEAKER_04]: You know this means I could do Supernatural cosplay because it's an anime now?

1316
01:26:33,282 --> 01:26:33,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1317
01:26:34,603 --> 01:26:35,384
[SPEAKER_07]: You and that show.

1318
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:35,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking love that show.

1319
01:26:35,944 --> 01:26:40,387
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like your new... You always get obsessed with one show at a time, and now it's that.

1320
01:26:41,067 --> 01:26:42,048
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been other ones in the past.

1321
01:26:42,068 --> 01:26:44,750
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've watched Supernatural for a while now.

1322
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:45,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1323
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:45,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Becky.

1324
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:47,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super strong now.

1325
01:26:47,572 --> 01:26:49,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, what about video game related stuff?

1326
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:53,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get into video games, you mentioned Panty and Stocking.

1327
01:26:53,335 --> 01:26:57,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised you didn't ask me if I cosplayed from that since you've seen some of the episodes.

1328
01:26:57,798 --> 01:26:59,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you cosplay from Penny and Stocky?

1329
01:26:59,959 --> 01:27:10,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I was Garterbelt That's awesome Very nice What video game content was there at KatsuCon?

1330
01:27:11,261 --> 01:27:24,044
[SPEAKER_06]: A massive gaming room and I know I've probably said this once before and I'll most likely say it again Dance Dance Revolution is pretty much officially dead at conventions Sad face, why is that?

1331
01:27:25,643 --> 01:27:26,764
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get the machines.

1332
01:27:27,144 --> 01:27:35,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're at a con where it's majority of, if it's a gaming convention or specifically an anime gaming convention, you'll see it.

1333
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:43,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So far at cons, most popular games you'll see is Pump It Up, Connect Games, and Rock Band.

1334
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:48,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, do you see people playing Dance Central in full cosplay now?

1335
01:27:49,317 --> 01:27:49,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I have.

1336
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:52,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a couple of people doing it in full cosplay gear.

1337
01:27:52,519 --> 01:27:53,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1338
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:53,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1339
01:27:55,086 --> 01:27:58,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have any pictures because at the time my camera was charging up in the room.

1340
01:27:59,889 --> 01:28:01,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuses, excuses.

1341
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,890
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to come to Fanime this year.

1342
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:05,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do Fanime this year.

1343
01:28:07,733 --> 01:28:08,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm broke.

1344
01:28:08,213 --> 01:28:10,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we even doing Fanime this year?

1345
01:28:10,235 --> 01:28:11,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning on doing Fanime.

1346
01:28:11,235 --> 01:28:13,676
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to talk to people and see if we can do a thing there.

1347
01:28:14,377 --> 01:28:18,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to think of a new costume for this year because none of my costumes fit.

1348
01:28:18,638 --> 01:28:24,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to Rice Princess because she was rattling off in guild chat the other night about wanting to do some type of cosplay.

1349
01:28:24,103 --> 01:28:24,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

1350
01:28:26,085 --> 01:28:28,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me ask one more question then.

1351
01:28:29,027 --> 01:28:31,189
[SPEAKER_07]: What was some good loot you saw in the dealer room?

1352
01:28:34,492 --> 01:28:35,393
[SPEAKER_07]: T-shirts mostly.

1353
01:28:36,994 --> 01:28:37,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Any good T-shirts?

1354
01:28:38,075 --> 01:28:38,816
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind?

1355
01:28:38,976 --> 01:28:40,397
[SPEAKER_07]: What were some funny slogans you saw?

1356
01:28:41,318 --> 01:28:42,419
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1357
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:45,702
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a female shirt with two boos on it.

1358
01:28:48,243 --> 01:28:50,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, so it's a shirt with boobs on it?

1359
01:28:50,924 --> 01:28:54,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and it says along the lines of, don't touch my booze or leave my booze on.

1360
01:28:55,946 --> 01:28:56,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1361
01:28:56,586 --> 01:28:58,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Please stop looking at my booze.

1362
01:28:58,386 --> 01:28:59,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's booze.

1363
01:28:59,207 --> 01:29:05,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was like one of those shirts where they draw the tuxedo on it or something, but it's just a shirt with boobs drawn on it.

1364
01:29:05,889 --> 01:29:06,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, why is that?

1365
01:29:06,849 --> 01:29:07,470
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not funny.

1366
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,090
[SPEAKER_07]: That's weird.

1367
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:08,890
[SPEAKER_07]: That's redundant.

1368
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

1369
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:10,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Booze.

1370
01:29:10,491 --> 01:29:11,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop looking at my booze.

1371
01:29:11,631 --> 01:29:12,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1372
01:29:12,271 --> 01:29:14,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the one that Becky has, though, of the D20s.

1373
01:29:14,492 --> 01:29:15,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, yes, they're natural.

1374
01:29:15,832 --> 01:29:16,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1375
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:17,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that before at conventions.

1376
01:29:18,013 --> 01:29:20,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget the Cleric shirt.

1377
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:21,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus one shirt.

1378
01:29:22,178 --> 01:29:22,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Cloth shirt.

1379
01:29:23,299 --> 01:29:23,680
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1380
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:26,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a parody of the Cleric's logo, but it says Cleric.

1381
01:29:26,943 --> 01:29:30,528
[SPEAKER_06]: It says they may heal you, but they still hate you.

1382
01:29:31,609 --> 01:29:33,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.

1383
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:34,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

1384
01:29:35,093 --> 01:29:36,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, one more question.

1385
01:29:36,394 --> 01:29:38,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Thing they most need at Katsukan 18.

1386
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Chicken Katsu What's that?

1387
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:54,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Febreze Alright buddy, I'm going to let you go Have a good one I'm posting this in the chat The masquerade was great There was a link to a video

1388
01:29:55,871 --> 01:29:57,212
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends doing a Super Mario Bros.

1389
01:29:57,252 --> 01:29:57,932
[SPEAKER_06]: musical too.

1390
01:29:57,972 --> 01:29:59,213
[SPEAKER_06]: What will Brian Boitano do?

1391
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:00,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really fun.

1392
01:30:00,514 --> 01:30:03,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, wait, I'm looking at this here.

1393
01:30:03,195 --> 01:30:04,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see an O. Anniversary.

1394
01:30:05,096 --> 01:30:05,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Anniversary.

1395
01:30:22,077 --> 01:30:30,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time I think I rescued the princess, she's always in another castle.

1396
01:30:30,599 --> 01:30:31,879
[SPEAKER_15]: And all I think of is this thing.

1397
01:30:32,339 --> 01:30:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready to deal with it.

1398
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:35,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what to do anymore.

1399
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario, you know this has.

1400
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:38,081
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.

1401
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:40,361
[SPEAKER_03]: What you need to do is think about your mental.

1402
01:30:40,461 --> 01:30:43,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he would do is really think that would work for him.

1403
01:30:44,767 --> 01:30:48,049
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the best part about watching these videos, Ranma, you know what the best part is?

1404
01:30:48,749 --> 01:30:49,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That being?

1405
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:56,773
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me that doing an internet podcast about video games for nine years really isn't the nerdiest thing I could be doing.

1406
01:30:59,235 --> 01:30:59,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1407
01:31:00,315 --> 01:31:01,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a wedding at AX.

1408
01:31:02,436 --> 01:31:02,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1409
01:31:02,897 --> 01:31:06,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen wedding proposals at Masquerades.

1410
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:07,519
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1411
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:08,820

01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:10,161

01:31:10,221 --> 01:31:10,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the call.

1415
01:31:14,455 --> 01:31:15,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what the hell, one more call.

1416
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:16,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Sons Radio, who's this?

1417
01:31:17,984 --> 01:31:18,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, can you hear me now?

1418
01:31:19,087 --> 01:31:20,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we can, what's up?

1419
01:31:20,751 --> 01:31:21,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's DDR Dollar Bill here.

1420
01:31:21,994 --> 01:31:23,358
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?

1421
01:31:24,861 --> 01:31:54,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you posting saying you didn't have anybody calling in so I figured well then it all flooded it always works that way I don't know if it's the delay or what because we have this weird two minute delay between when we do things here in studio and when you guys hear it it used to be like 15 seconds and then all games change some things around I think we bounce I think our feed goes out into space and then comes back to earth before it gets to you now but whatever hey you know what at least we have a place to do our show what's on your mind buddy

1422
01:31:56,341 --> 01:31:57,422
[SPEAKER_08]: and nothing much.

1423
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:00,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Just calling on pass if I say hi.

1424
01:32:02,006 --> 01:32:05,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Still waiting on a friend of mine trying to create a gaming laptop for me.

1425
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:07,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Gaming laptop?

1426
01:32:07,371 --> 01:32:08,872
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you looking for in your gaming laptop?

1427
01:32:09,693 --> 01:32:10,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it this way.

1428
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:25,627
[SPEAKER_08]: This has got to be something that can play at least, the very, very least, something like Mass Effect 2 or Call of Duty at least 60 frames per second.

1429
01:32:25,687 --> 01:32:27,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't do a little netbook.

1430
01:32:27,647 --> 01:32:30,048
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to do something a little more uber than that.

1431
01:32:30,988 --> 01:32:31,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1432
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:32,589
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's something funny today, though.

1433
01:32:33,629 --> 01:32:36,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried a couple over at the Best Buy just for kicks and giggles.

1434
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

1435
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:37,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1436
01:32:39,349 --> 01:32:44,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the hell most of these guys are doing, but I crashed every one of them.

1437
01:32:45,635 --> 01:32:47,617
[SPEAKER_07]: You crashed every laptop at Best Buy?

1438
01:32:47,637 --> 01:32:48,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people do that on purpose.

1439
01:32:49,498 --> 01:32:57,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people will go into Fry's and try to crash all the computers before they get caught by the burly-looking dudes that are trying to sell the computers.

1440
01:32:57,386 --> 01:32:57,826
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

1441
01:32:58,927 --> 01:33:00,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I would know, but I've heard.

1442
01:33:02,697 --> 01:33:03,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I did this on accident!

1443
01:33:04,358 --> 01:33:05,299
[SPEAKER_08]: All of them!

1444
01:33:05,979 --> 01:33:08,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you hitting Ctrl-Alt-Delete on all of them as you walked by?

1445
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:13,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's not a bad thing to do on a computer as it used to be.

1446
01:33:14,906 --> 01:33:15,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I did something else.

1447
01:33:16,267 --> 01:33:18,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Half of them, I was just checking out some of the specs.

1448
01:33:18,809 --> 01:33:26,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them, I was just trying to run this one website where you can check to see if the computer can run your game.

1449
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:31,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget what it's called right now, but it was a really good one, and

1450
01:33:33,205 --> 01:33:42,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get it later on, but I tried a couple of those and they started crashing and then I had to reboot a couple of them and I'm like, what the hell is going on here?

1451
01:33:43,533 --> 01:33:45,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't anybody make a good computer anymore?

1452
01:33:45,774 --> 01:33:47,235
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of questions in our chat room here.

1453
01:33:47,315 --> 01:33:51,218
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkToagak says 60 frames a second is overkill.

1454
01:33:51,518 --> 01:33:52,339
[SPEAKER_07]: 30's not cutting it for you?

1455
01:33:53,581 --> 01:33:53,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell.

1456
01:33:54,322 --> 01:33:54,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking.

1457
01:33:55,302 --> 01:33:55,683
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1458
01:33:56,283 --> 01:33:57,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that coming.

1459
01:33:57,144 --> 01:33:57,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

1460
01:33:58,084 --> 01:34:08,012
[SPEAKER_08]: No offense, but if I want 30 frames per second, I'll play it on the Xbox and be quite honest, 30 frames per second actually... It's not accurate.

1461
01:34:08,212 --> 01:34:09,393
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't feel real.

1462
01:34:10,073 --> 01:34:10,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1463
01:34:11,554 --> 01:34:17,136
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I play a lot better when it's full frames, when it's a smooth motion, because then it feels more real to me.

1464
01:34:17,156 --> 01:34:21,057
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 frames, it's all choppy, and I'm missing shots left and right.

1465
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:23,398
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I need to be that precise.

1466
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:27,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And Brad from PodCulture is saying, isn't it rather hard to build a custom laptop?

1467
01:34:27,879 --> 01:34:28,760
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a good question.

1468
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, laptops are not quite as easy to build as the desktops.

1469
01:34:33,348 --> 01:34:33,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

1470
01:34:34,129 --> 01:34:36,351
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just trying to find the one that matches your specifications?

1471
01:34:58,567 --> 01:34:59,087
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1472
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:28,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I've done it before.

1473
01:35:29,471 --> 01:35:29,771
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1474
01:35:30,031 --> 01:35:31,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?

1475
01:35:34,192 --> 01:35:37,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to rewire my damn pad so I can play DDR again.

1476
01:35:38,053 --> 01:35:39,514
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new one coming out on the Wii.

1477
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:41,234
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the reason.

1478
01:35:41,254 --> 01:35:43,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a wire so I can play on the Wii.

1479
01:35:45,305 --> 01:35:46,905
[SPEAKER_08]: New Lady Gaga and Paramore.

1480
01:35:47,226 --> 01:35:48,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And PS3.

1481
01:35:49,106 --> 01:35:49,386
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1482
01:35:49,726 --> 01:35:50,186
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, buddy.

1483
01:35:50,346 --> 01:35:51,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck on your quest for new DDR.

1484
01:35:52,287 --> 01:35:52,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1485
01:35:53,227 --> 01:35:53,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, guys.

1486
01:35:53,887 --> 01:35:54,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Check you later.

1487
01:35:54,508 --> 01:35:54,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1488
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:56,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess DDR dollar bill is not just a clever name.

1489
01:35:56,908 --> 01:35:57,709
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1490
01:35:57,729 --> 01:35:59,129
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line up.

1491
01:35:59,149 --> 01:36:00,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to those folks who didn't get through tonight.

1492
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:01,490
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always send us an email.

1493
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Mail that orange lingerie dot com.

1494
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:06,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I love some of this evil stuff you guys are talking about in chat.

1495
01:36:07,491 --> 01:36:13,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad from Pod Culture says, I've also done stuff like take a screenshot, set us wallpaper, then hide all the icons.

1496
01:36:13,913 --> 01:36:14,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1497
01:36:14,713 --> 01:36:15,333
[SPEAKER_07]: That's evil.

1498
01:36:15,373 --> 01:36:20,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at my work, we were always told we had to lock our desktops.

1499
01:36:21,195 --> 01:36:28,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So the manager of our group would actually go in and do, you know those little rotating word screensavers?

1500
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:29,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1501
01:36:29,637 --> 01:36:37,159
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd put those up or like put pictures of like blingy teeth up, you know, and put it on tile and

01:36:37,499 --> 01:36:53,992

1503
01:36:54,532 --> 01:36:55,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes real life gets in the way.

1504
01:36:56,234 --> 01:36:58,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1505
01:36:58,737 --> 01:36:59,799
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, have you sobered up?

1506
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

1507
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it tasted like ice cream.

1508
01:37:04,224 --> 01:37:05,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

1509
01:37:06,106 --> 01:37:08,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinkberry!

01:37:08,188 --> 01:37:09,310
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is...
