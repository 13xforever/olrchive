DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, February 27th, 2011 The 3DS launches in Japan We Dare might be too daring for the US And will Guitar Hero get more download content after all?
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Booze Booze
I have... Apparently she's drank too much of that booze already.
No, no, no.
I have... She done forgot.
Stop interrupting me.
I have Irish... Wait, did you guys hear that?
I'm sorry.
This is worth interrupting.
Did you hear that?
Stop interrupting me.
She's slurring already.
Stop interrupting me.
No.
I have Bailey's Irish Cream with the last of my Kahlua and ice cubes and whipped cream, but I've mixed the whipped cream into it, so it cuts some of the...
www.DarkSakura.com
Well, let me get to that.
Techmaster Loki is out tonight.
He actually had an emergency circumstance this week.
Don't worry, guys.
He's fine.
But what happened, I guess he went in on Tuesday to the doctor and found out he had a hernia.
The same kind his child did.
That's...
Living with a hernia
so he had to have the surgery for that or I guess availability came up on Friday or something like that but he like didn't know he was gonna have the surgery and suddenly was like you're having the surgery okay so he had the surgery which you know my favorite thing to do is can is confused and sometimes it's on purpose it's confused hernias and hemorrhoids and ask if they need a donut a little different little different
So yeah, he's recovering.
He's not able to drive out to the show.
He could be listening, so hi Loki if you're listening.
But he's probably sleeping because I know when I had surgery, granted I had the gallbladder thing which is a little different, but I slept for like seven days straight.
So that could be where Loki's at right now, I don't know.
But regardless, you won't be here tonight.
So it's just DarkSakura and I holding down the fort.
We didn't have enough time to, since we just found out about it on Friday and I'm usually gone on the weekend, we didn't have time to cook up a guest host.
So it's just here, just the two of us here.
And one of us has been drinking, so this is sure to be a wonderful show tonight.
Rob had some of my tasty beverage.
It is delicious, isn't it?
Nothing.
But luckily we have you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com joining us as you do every week here as we tape live our show.
We couldn't appreciate you guys anymore, especially this week.
You guys are awesome.
And speaking of chat room stories, some folks were asking before the show, you know, can we talk about the Oscars?
Because that's going on tonight.
On top of everything else, the Oscars are going on tonight.
I wanna call them the Betty Whiteskers
But yeah, I don't know why you'd want to yell out the winners in the chatroom Because anybody who cares probably already has on the TV But whatever, people want to yell it out And I think SSJ went under mad a joke before the show That if Betty White's not at the Oscars, who cares?
And I said, look, you can, fine, you can yell out the names of the winners But you just have to change everything so that Betty White won everything And so now Betty White has just become the new Chuck Norris in our chatroom But you know what, guys?
I think it's very well deserved You know why?
You know why it's well deserved?
Hold on, listen to this
The reason I lied, if I told you the truth, you'd hunt it down and kill it, which seems to be exactly what you're trying to do.
How long have you been feeding this thing?
Six years.
Six years?
Well, Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home.
So we threw it some scraps.
Well, he didn't seem to bother anybody.
He became kind of like a pet who lives in the wild.
He just appeared.
You have no idea how he arrived here.
No, do you?
Your husband Bernie, you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded?
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.
There you go.
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.
That's why Betty White is awesome.
I love her.
Yes, amazing.
Anyhow, that was the movie Lake Placid, by the way, if you never saw that.
It was a really corny-ass movie, but Betty White made it, of course.
Of course.
Anyhow, let's see.
Yeah, so we're going to get into the show as you guys join us in our chat room.
We're going to do a little bit of a short show.
We're doing an abbreviated show tonight, meaning we're not going to have a break in the middle.
We're going to blaze right through both halves of our show.
Don't worry.
We're still going to take calls at the end.
We're still going to do all your favorite segments.
We're just doing it a little shorter tonight because we don't have Loki, for one.
It's just the two of us, and with everything we're competing against and so forth, we figured, you know what?
Let's have this be a minimum day.
Remember those in school, you'd have a minimum day so the teachers could get service?
We never had such a thing.
Huh?
We didn't have minimum days.
Really?
We had minimum days here all the time.
We had teacher work days.
Oh, okay.
It's similar.
But teacher work days were awesome because guess who didn't have to go to school?
That would be all of us.
But the teachers did.
The teachers did.
We're having a minimum day here at OLR so we can go have a business meeting at Pinkberry.
So there you go.
Actually, there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, but things I can't tell you.
Dude, Spazinator said that if he has alcohol, he'll go psychotic and die.
That's no good.
I had a friend in college who was schizophrenic and took LSD.
Wow.
It's Mystique!
Mystique!
Mystique, you want to sit in on the show for a minute?
Come in and introduce yourself.
Oh God, I love Mystique.
I'm so happy she's here.
Hold on, we gotta get her hooked up.
Live radio, folks.
I am the goddamn Batman.
That she is.
Why are you the goddamn Batman?
Which, by the way, is one of my favorite Twitter accounts that they have anywhere.
Because I'm awesome.
What more do you need?
I'm awesome.
That and she's got a batarang in her pants.
Okay, there.
I've got you your own mic now, so there you go.
Sweet.
So, what are you up to these days, Mystique?
What have you been playing?
Are you playing video games these days?
What are you playing?
Of course she is, because she just got the thing.
Tell them what you got.
I got what?
Batman.
Batman.
Oh, I already did the Batman Arkham Asylum because that game was awesome.
But the new one's coming out.
I know.
It's not coming out soon enough, though, because I need it now.
Like, now.
Because it's goddamn Batman.
Yeah, it's the goddamn Batman.
And the goddamn Joker.
See, it's not about Batman for her.
It's about Joker.
It's all about the Joker and not the Heath Ledger Joker.
Ooh, what you got against Heath Ledger?
It's Oscar night.
I don't care.
Betty White's winning everything, by the way.
We don't care who won anything in the Oscars as long as Betty White did it.
Unless Betty White did it.
Betty White is pretty awesome.
Yeah, that's right.
Betty White has actually just announced the new villain in the next Batman movie, so there you go.
She's gonna be Catwoman, actually.
She just took down that bitch Anne Hathaway behind the stage and was like... I can totally see that shit.
Betty White is hardcore.
And of course the next game coming out is Betty White vs. Capcom.
I would totally play that game.
She heard that Anne Hathaway got the part of Catwoman and this is what she said in response.
There you go.
Alright, anyhow.
I remember certain conversations where someone in this room used to say, I wish I had one of those.
I do wish I had a dick.
It would be awesome.
Why?
Because then, I could pee wherever I was, and It doesn't quite work like that.
Hold on.
And, when I beat the crap out of somebody, I could whip out my dick and piss all over them.
Can't you kind of do that now?
It's messier.
It's messier because you really got to take down your pants.
All right, look.
There's a lot of work.
Oh, look, the listener count is plummeting as we hear these details.
I told them about you in Wild Chat last night, by the way.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So now I've gone broke leveling jewel crafting.
Now I'm working on mining and sort of archaeology, but not really.
Just because I think that reading some of this stuff is funny.
Holy shit, she's going to be an archaeologist like Indiana Jones.
He's in the game, Harrison Jones.
Shut the hell up.
And I believe someone does say no time for love, Dr. Jones.
Sweet.
Yes.
You've got to have a short round.
Yeah.
Oh, he's awesome.
I'll have to go back and show you videos of all that.
But anyway.
You just need to play for Harrison Jones because that's what it's all about is the whole archaeology thing in Oldham.
So cool.
But anyway, and then I decided to work on my puppy.
I just call her my puppy.
I still hate dungeons on my puppy because people don't know what a freaking tank is apparently if you're lower than level 20.
But tanks run over people.
And tanks also take a lot of damage without feeling it.
I wish I had a tank.
I want a tank for real life.
Wouldn't it be cool?
It's like if you were in school and you just had someone be your tank.
That would be pretty awesome.
You had your party and your tank would be like, I don't feel anything.
I'm Teflon.
I'm rubber, you're glue.
And you would always be able to find a parking spot.
And then you had like your healer who would basically go around going, it's okay, don't worry about it.
You're going to be just fine.
They're idiots.
They're bitches.
And then you've got your other three friends who are your DPS.
Bitch, I heard what you just said!
It's on now.
Bring it.
See, that would be World of Warcraft for high school.
I just put it on my Facebook.
Loki, if you're listening, this is what happens when you're not here.
Just want to point that out.
You're missed a lot.
Yeah, but our aim's improving.
I've made Misty laugh.
Laughing is fun.
I had liquor.
Want some?
If it's not obvious.
What are you talking about?
She's always like this.
But I'm extra like this.
Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us besides WoW?
Betty White, The RPG
because sometimes you just need pills different colored pills especially the red one is there a particular virus that's like is it the red virus or the yellow virus she has the G virus so if she doesn't have her pills she turns into a zombie and totally sucks brains because brains taste good itchy tasty itchy tasty
So, Dr. Mario, wait, actually, let me ask you the really compelling question when it comes to Dr. Mario.
Music type A or B?
Music type B. B for bitchin'.
Yes.
Because I like to kick it old school.
What?
You just made a song pop into my head.
What's that?
A Dead Milkman song.
It's a bitchin' Camaro.
Bitchin' Camaro, bitchin' Camaro.
I ran over my mother.
I love that song.
I had to download that the other day so I could play it in the car.
Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Dark Tatuya says, Rob, I think the women just hijacked the show.
You know, I think you're right.
Yay, estrogen!
Woo!
Oh my God, help me.
We got this!
The powers of the jubbles compel you.
The minute you guys start braiding each other's hair and start talking about boys.
My hair is already braided.
Misty pays someone to do hers, so.
I just flat iron mine, you know, with an iron.
I like that you've got like purple and then black and purple.
You've got like a Red X-13 thing going on there.
DarkSakura.com
Because he likes to kill people.
She also likes Prince for similar reasons.
Exactly.
Prince likes to kill people too.
This is our new album artist Mystique Shoes.
Awesome.
All right, I'll talk about my gaming week.
I played a little bit of WoW as well, but I did play other stuff too.
I'm actually really addicted to on the iPhone, and I know when I say that, there's this whole cluster of people out there that's like, oh, God, the iPhone.
I'm really addicted to Cut the Rope, you guys.
It's adorable and cute.
And the new game, Jump the Shark.
Is there really a game called Jump the Shark?
I don't know.
There probably is somewhere.
All right.
There's an episode of Supernatural called Jump the Shark.
Oh, Mystique has left the building.
All right.
Well, everybody calm down.
It'll be okay.
And then, what else have I played this week?
I played Bejeweled Blitz on the Xbox 360, which is, I guess you could say PopCap's way of cashing in on the Facebook game, which has been doing very well for them.
Although, I don't think this was developed by PopCap.
I mean, I think it was in agreement with them, but I saw another developer's name come up when I started the game.
And I gotta be honest, guys, I could tell that someone else developed this right off the bat.
It just didn't have that same...
Polish.
And I don't know how else to say this.
And I know I'm sounding really harsh, but when I go in there, especially with the graphics, the graphics do not have that same polish that I have seen in the other PopCap games.
And it's buffing.
And I guess, yes, the jewels needed to be polished.
I don't know.
But yeah, I...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I would really only recommend this game to somebody who doesn't have any of the other Bejeweled games, who really loves their casual games, who's looking for this fix.
But I honestly think most of you would play this game for a little bit and then go back to the one on Facebook if you really want to play Bejeweled.
Because I think the controller thing would drive you bonkers after a while when you can be so much faster with a mouse or with your finger.
It's just one of those games, it just didn't work in translation.
It's kind of a bummer.
And I kind of think that's why PopCap probably didn't do it themselves.
Maybe.
They probably just kind of let somebody else do it.
Yikes.
They're going to give us how much money for this game?
Outsource this scrap.
It's $10 if you want to buy that on Xbox Live Marketplace.
But there's a lot of great stuff coming out of the Turnpike on Xbox Live Marketplace that I'm definitely checking out over the next few weeks.
Beyond Good and Evil HD, a lot of people looking forward to that.
Torchlight, oh my god, I'm so excited for Torchlight.
on Xbox Live.
I am so curious to see.
Speaking of a game that feels very, you know, one way on the PC, I'm really curious to see how they translated this to Xbox 360 controller because apparently they changed quite a bit.
So I'll definitely be checking that out.
I think that's the 15th that that comes out.
So I'll be looking at that.
And that does it for my gaming week So let's move on And go over some housekeeping real quick Not a whole lot I just want to mention of course our Twitter Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course you can follow Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook as well And if you like Orange Lounge Radio And you like all this craziness and zaniness That we bring you every week That's sometimes very random as it was tonight I just found out something Rob What's that?
You mentioning PopCap made me want to check for Peggle on Steam Peggle Extreme is free
DarkSakura.com
We really, really do appreciate you guys taking the time out to leave us a nice review.
And that doesn't have to just be iTunes.
I know some of you guys are like, oh, I'm never going to touch iTunes with a 10-foot pole.
Wherever it is that you can read about podcasts, if you can leave a nice review for us, that'd be awesome.
All right, let's move on to some gaming news.
Let's get into the news tonight.
We're going to start off with the 3DS launch.
The 3DS did launch in Japan.
It did make its release date, and I guess, you know, it was a very cold day in Japan, but people were still lining up for it.
There were extras left over.
You didn't have to pre-order it.
They were able to get their hands on it if they didn't pre-order it.
However, the initial shipment of 400,000 units arrived
DarkSakura.com
Some of the best-selling ones, at least visually, I mean, they're not going to know until the numbers come out, but people that were on location reporting, watching what people were buying, saying that Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition and the Professor Layton game appeared to be the big sellers, which will probably be similar over here, at least with Super Street Fighter.
Did Professor Layton make launch over here?
I'm not sure it did.
I don't recall.
I think it might have been.
The Layton games are fairly popular here, too.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
They definitely have their audience.
But I think the Super Street Fighter will probably be the big seller out the gate.
And honestly, Nintendogs, I think it's going to be a huge one for Nintendo.
Just knowing that the target audience, again, not the folks that listen to this podcast, but kids...
Between the ages of like, I don't know, when do kids start using the 3DS?
Maybe like 6, 7, on up through like 13 are going to be all over Nintendogs and Cats.
And I think even some adults will be too.
And I got to admit, I'll probably buy it because I'm a sucker.
Big sucker.
So there you go.
uh yeah so it's sold out now in Japan so if you didn't already import this thing you might have a hard time you're gonna have to wait for the next shipment but it does sound like it's a successful launch over there now we want to hear about the next wave of games coming out but I guess we'll just have to wait until E3
Yeah, well, I was looking at all the, they've definitely got all the pre-order stuff going on at GameStop today, which is where I went today to pick up Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
And they're pushing it.
So, hey.
But how about something that's a little naughty, Rob?
Yay, I love naughty things.
Naughty.
Wait, should we get Mystique back for this?
Because she's pretty naughty too.
A little randy.
Oh, okay.
Raunchy.
A little sassy.
We Dare
Well, really, it has you spanking your friends and snugging your controller and getting naked.
What?
Well, at least in your underwear.
Okay, wait.
Is this the trailer here?
Can I watch this?
Or is this going to tell me I can only watch this because it's bound to Europe?
Or is this going to work?
Well, now there's a stupid ad playing, so no one cares about the ad.
This is a really slow site.
Let me see if it's on YouTube somewhere.
We're going to go to YouTube.
I want to see this.
I literally have not... I heard about the game, but I didn't watch this trailer.
Well, I'm going to pull up the... So it's like truth or dare?
Well, I'm pulling up the Amazon UK product description.
Wow, it's $16.99 over there.
Okay, wait, here we go, here we go.
I got a trailer.
Here we go.
Okay, right off the bat, that sounds like a Cinemax movie score there in the background Well, the cover has a pink chair with a bra on it and fuzzy handcuffs and some high heels Wow, hold on, hold on
Okay, so there's this mini game where there's like an apple and the two of them are eating it and somebody is like dangling a Wiimote between these two people that are just kind of like... It's a little bit... I'm going to leave the thing in the chat room.
You see my friend...
Wow.
So this chick had to put a Wiimote in her back pocket, kind of like tucked into the back of her pants, and now the boys are spanking her in order to fly through the cloud level here.
And now this other chick, she took her ponytail out.
And of course the chicks get to spank each other.
Yeah.
Of course.
And now there's a pole dancing one.
No.
Wow.
Wow.
Okay, I want someone to get that for me.
Here's the thing.
I'll send you candy.
Okay, so those are like dumb little party games that, to be honest, now what's the uproar about this?
They're worried that kids would play this because it's a Wii game and, you know, the target audience is usually kids?
Because people over here have the big anal stick.
Okay, here's the thing.
I'm honestly watching those things that are going on.
Those are all the games we played at parties when I was 12.
Yeah.
Like, remember two minutes in the closet?
Spin the bottle.
What do you mean when you were 12?
I was at a party five years ago where you were playing Spill the Bottle.
Well, you kind of diffused the point I was about to make because I was going to say, now you're trying to tell me that a bunch of 20-year-olds are going to play these same games that we played when we were 12?
Yes.
Look, we were drunk.
Okay, that's all I'm saying.
I don't need a Wii to help me with that.
You know what I mean?
I don't need a Nintendo Wii to help me with that.
It's a fun idea.
I think that Ubisoft is just being, oh, the Americans are going to preach at us.
They're going to send Jesus on us.
Well, no.
It's a little silly that the game can't come out here.
Gripper01 says it's 16 quid cheap, by the way.
Why don't they just put a gigantic red warning label that takes off half the box that says, not for kids.
And then, honestly, it will sell more copies if it has that sticker on it.
Because people here don't give a shit.
They don't read the box.
The kids read the box.
Their parents don't read the box.
They expect the person behind the counter to babysit for them.
And guess what?
No.
And then they get all mad.
Oh, but my little kid has this game and they're spanking people in it.
Well, why didn't you supervise the purchase?
Hi.
Hi.
so I guess it's just do your damn job you could import it I guess if you really want it I will send a bunch of American candy will this come out in Canada?
I wonder
I do like booze a lot
Is there a beer land?
Is there like a Disneyland that's just booze everywhere?
Probably not.
Anyhow, this probably won't be it either.
There's a brand new amusement park in China that is going to feature Warcraft and Starcraft sections in it.
This is legitimate.
This is not like a trolling thing.
There's pictures of construction that are showing up already.
By the way, not coming out in Canada.
It's not on their list.
Joyland, World of Legend, Mole's World, The Island of Mystery, Universe of Starcraft, and Terrain of Warcraft
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This actually looks really cool.
It's a huge, huge infringement of intellectual property, but because you have the whole international thing coming into play, it's really hard to say what Blizzard can actually do about it.
Now, some of the big blogs here in the US have tried to reach out to Blizzard for comment, but of course, I don't think Blizzard's going to say anything publicly.
We wish we thought of this first.
Well, that's kind of what I was getting to, is that a lot of people...
You've seen this kind of spread across game blogs this week and so forth.
A lot of people think this is a cool idea.
So why don't we have some type of video game theme park already if there's so much interest in something like this?
Like, for real, why don't we have a video game theme park?
We've got a Harry Potter park too late.
Why not?
Do you think that maybe the audience is just not... I mean, for a World of Warcraft-themed land in a park, people wouldn't be into that?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, they turned the TV show Survivor into a ride.
It's actually really cool.
It's one of the better rides in the park, honestly.
But it's just basically a little disc-oriented roller coaster.
It really has nothing to do with the damn show.
You don't vote people off the ride or nothing.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Great America, being in Santa Clara, being in the heart of Silicon Valley, is there any better place to build a theme park?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DemandGameNation.com The first experimental video game theme park and resort In the next 12 months, we'll be deciding the best location for the experimental theme park.
uh visitors will be players as their dreams and fantasies come to life and adventures yet to be told so in the next 12 months they'll tell us where they're thinking about building the park dude I'm telling you just take something existing that needs the help seriously
But I'm glad at least some people are already on it.
But that's a monumental undertaking.
That's going to take a lot of money and investments.
And you're right, Jamie.
Theme parks haven't been doing so well in the recession.
In fact, theme parks have been closing and so forth.
So I really think, I don't know, the smart thing would be to team up with a theme park that's already there.
Buy an old one out and do your thing.
Reimagine the rides.
Exactly.
And build it somewhere where people are going to want to visit for other stuff too.
Don't build it in South Dakota.
No offense to the residents of South Dakota, but you got what?
Mount Rushmore?
I'm in Delaware.
So you know what I mean.
You got to build it somewhere where people are going to want to go.
TigerClaw on chat says, you know, we need an Orange Lounge Radio theme park.
You know, I'm just not thinking there's going to be enough of an audience for that.
Maybe what we could get is we could get a booth at the video game theme park.
Maybe we could get a little corner of a room.
The Orange Lounge Radio booth.
That would probably be the best we could do.
Actually, we probably wouldn't even have a booth.
We'd probably just be outside the front door.
Exactly.
It's cold.
We're so cold.
Let us in.
That'll be us.
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
Yeah, well, how about something a little bit, well, it kind of makes me laugh, because Portal 2, well, the German PlayStation blog was told that it completely supports the move, but it's not fully integrated yet.
Actually, Valve's like, no.
No.
It was mistranslated from the English to the German.
And then, of course, translated from the messed up German back into English.
So, nope.
They say that for the PC, it will support the Hydra controller.
And that it's going to support the regular console controllers, but no move.
It could be patched in, but when asked about it, they said, who knows?
We don't know that it'll make the game better.
There's games that the Kinect and the Move are great for, but not this one.
They said, though, for the Hydra that they actually invented puzzles specifically for how the Hydra would work.
So, no move.
Oops.
Nine.
I thought it would be a little weird if they just suddenly put the move in.
Because, you know, the PS3 version of Portal 2 is already going to have all these extra features that aren't on the regular, or I'm sorry, not the regular, the Xbox 360 version, the ASPC version.
Do Host 9 move?
I love our chat room I love our chat room Oh boy
All right, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.
Things that are actually happening near you at a local game store near you.
Coming out this week in the U.S.
Since Loki's not here, I'll do the U.S.
dates real quick.
Do it in the Loki voice.
What's the Loki voice?
We got some stuff coming out.
This game's coming out.
It's probably going to suck.
And some shit on PlayStation 3.
God damn you, Nintendo.
God damn you.
God damn you for releasing this game, Rango.
Who's going to play that?
March 1st is when Rango comes out on the Wii.
Is that a movie or something?
Johnny Depp does a voice, I guess.
I think there's a lot of people interested in Rift, though.
That is coming out on March 1st.
I believe some people already have it.
If you pre-ordered it, you get the whole early access.
The official release date for the game is March 1st.
This is a new MMO.
Some people are saying it's the WoW killer, but I hate that term.
It's not the WoW killer.
The only WoW killer is WoW.
Like the Remnant Empire.
Yep.
Disgaea, The Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP comes out this week.
More versions of Rango on other systems including Xbox 360, blah, blah, blah.
A brand new racing wheel if you're so inclined.
You need one for your PC.
You can get a $300 racing wheel.
Should I show that to Dan?
Fight Night Champion comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.
And Mahjong Journey, Quest for Tikal.
For you Mahjong fans on the DS, oh boy, it's party time this week.
Let's see if there's anything else here.
I know people who really, really like Mahjong.
Well, it's party time.
Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice on the PS3.
Oh, that's a pretty big one there.
Sounds like life at my house.
Yeah, there's some folks that have fun with Disgaea.
That's coming out.
And Fight Night Champion also comes out on the PS3.
Chuck E. Cheese's Sports Games comes out on the Wii.
Really?
What is the Chuck E. Cheese Sports Games?
Is it dodging bullets?
And what else happens at Chuck E. Cheese these days?
Fights that break out at the tables with the animatronic characters?
I don't know if you read the stories about all the really, really terrible things that happen at Chuck E. Cheese.
But let me just say, it's not a place I would ever take my child.
No, no.
Chuck E. Cheese was awesome when we were kids.
Yes, it was.
But now it's a dangerous place.
Now it's a frightening place loaded with bad food and unwashed children.
Puzzle Expedition comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.
And let's see if there's anything else here I want to mention.
Minute to Win It on the Nintendo DS as well.
If you're a fan of that crappy game show.
I've never heard of that one, Rob.
What is that?
It's hosted by that guy on the Food Network with the bleached hair who's like 50 years old and it's like, dude, you're too old to bleach your hair.
He's such a bro.
He is.
He's a dude bro and he hosts this show where they give away like a million fucking dollars if he can throw ping pong balls into cups.
Like, it's the weirdest... That's bizarre.
It's like, you know...
The budget is that of going to Target and buying plastic wreaths that they build games out of and they give away a million dollars.
We made this game out of the dollar store.
So here's the deal, guys.
If you want to play the home version of Minute to Win It, you could spend $40 on the DS version or...
or you could go to the 99 cent clearance center and buy some ping pong balls and some plastic cups and play the actual games that they play on the show.
Or you could pay 10 times as much and play some fake shit.
Ah, shitty.
I am astounded every day at what goes on in this industry.
People are tarred.
and folks in chat room speaking up there.
Defective Candy says his name is Guy and he's from the Food Network.
Yes, that's his name, Guy.
I think he owns a joint.
Isn't Johnny Garlic's his chain or is that someone else?
I have no idea.
It's Guy Fieri.
Yeah, I think he owns that Johnny Garlic's.
There's one of those out in Roseville.
Overpriced.
Yeah.
Overrated.
Anyhow, William Murderface in chat says it's beer pong for kids.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and DarkSakura.com.
I want the fat British woman to cook my food.
Except I think one of them died.
Can I do Japanese releases, please?
Yeah, I guess.
Alright, coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, Borderlands and Hokuto Musou get price reductions because they go into the Platinum Collections.
Friday Night Champion is the new release to look for on the Xbox 360 this week.
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they get Fight Night Champion there as well.
Yep.
They also get Samurai Dō 4 comes out there from Spike.
Thanks for watching!
I don't know if you ever played those games, but man, there's like tons of stuff you can do with them.
On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.
It's the Nintendo Wii.
There's nothing coming out for it.
On the Nintendo 3DS, yes, we have to start reading those dates now.
On the 3DS, Shanghai 3D Cube and Super Monkey Ball 3D come out this week.
More Mahjong.
More Mahjong.
That's right.
Oh, by the way, Rob, apparently Betty White won for sound mixing in Inception.
No one care.
On the Nintendo DS, we have Digimon Story in Super Shroce Wars Red and Blue.
Digimon, DarkSakura?
You were the only person I knew that liked Digimon.
Oh, I liked the anime.
And then you don't like the games?
I had a Digimon lastly on the PSP this is a huge huge release probably the biggest release of the week Dissida 012 Duodesim Final Fantasy that's right the sequel to Final Fantasy Dissida makes its way out in Japan this week on the PSP so I'm sure there'll be a lot of folks into that alright how about the UK well for the UK we do have some interesting news this is BBC2 bringing you the news on game releases in the United Kingdom okay actually on the first we have Fable 3 again
Fable 3 was kind of crap.
We have Two Worlds 2.
We have Beyond Good and Evil HD.
That one's on the second, by the way.
On the fourth, we have Fight Night Champion, Hyperdimension Neptunia, Pokemon Black, Pokemon White, Rift, Planes of Who Gives a Crap, I mean, sorry, Talara, and U-Draw.
It wasn't that bad.
Rift was interesting, but I don't know.
I can't pay for another MMO right now.
I got too many other expenses to worry about.
I can't pay for them either.
Yeah.
So that's it.
That's it.
All right.
Then let's move on to some rapid fire news.
We're going to go over some news very quickly here.
By the way, this is your last chance to get the Twitter topics in.
We're going to be doing Twitter topics in just a moment.
So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.
We're going to be doing those in just a minute.
But first, I'm going to start off with some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.
Dragon Age 2, the demo for that hit Xbox Live And it's getting a lot of good reception out there It's also on the PC and so forth Dragon Age 2 is going to be coming out very soon And they have announced that there's going to be a theme song in the game By Florence and the Machine Who's a pretty popular band these days They were really indie for a while And then she did the Dog Days Are Over thing at the MTV Awards And it just blew up, they're huge, they're everywhere
Anyway, she's really awesome, actually.
And a song from the album Lungs called I'm Not Calling You a Liar is being reimagined.
So it's going to be called I'm Not Calling You a Liar, Dragon Age 2, Variks theme.
Here's the original if you want a taste of what the song sounds like.
There's a ghost in my lungs and it soars in my soul.
So you kind of get the idea.
They'll rework that song a little bit.
It's not going to sound just like that, but that's going to be the theme song for Dragon Age 2.
Some websites shut down this week.
Some community-based websites.
As you probably heard about before on the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf Show, 360 Junkies was a blog about the 360 and unfortunately they had to close their door this week due to personal issues.
MyGamerCard.net was a pretty big website in the community that also had to shut down this week.
So we lost two good ones this week, unfortunately.
The story behind MyGamerCard.net, though, a little more dramatic.
The founder of the website, Jason Young, left a pretty big goodbye on the site saying, quote, the love for community has been lost by Microsoft, saying that a lot of the community stuff that has been going on has stagnated and even used the term lack of respect.
Ouch.
She's great
Yeah, she's cool.
And it's just different over there now.
So it's, I don't know, it's kind of unfortunate.
I wonder if this will service a wake-up call to Microsoft.
Maybe there will be some type of community thing in response.
I think it's going to be very interesting to see if Microsoft responds to this or if they just don't care.
It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that.
Because a lot of people were using that gamer card service, you know, on their websites.
And I even had it on my LiveJournal.
EveryAir.com
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
gotta be honest this sounds like a whole lot for what's not going to be very practical but they do show some video of this thing running there's a whole little YouTube there let's see if we can get past the animation there and get to this thing actually working yeah there's somebody playing LittleBigPlanet on their phone starting it up so I don't know though that seems like a lot just to get that working on your iPod it doesn't I don't know
But hey, it's one of those things where it's like installing Linux on a toaster.
Why do it?
Because we can.
Exactly.
We do what we must because we can.
Absolutely.
So there you go.
Well, how about some other news, Rob?
First of all, the PlayStation, sorry, the PSP is going to be having a price drop.
It's going to go down to $130.
So I wonder if that's preparing the market, maybe clearing out some inventory for the new thingies coming out.
But they've been slashing them, so now it's actually somewhat affordable.
Who knows, right?
and other happy, happy, happy news.
The Legend of Zelda celebrates 25 years.
We have had Legend of Zelda for a very long time.
Older than a lot of our listeners.
And of course we are going to be seeing Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword coming out.
Hopefully before too long.
And pretty cool stuff.
Rob, did you start off with the first one?
Which one?
I'm sorry.
The first Legend of Zelda.
Oh yeah, oh gosh yes.
Of course, that was my very first Zelda game.
I remember playing that in the fourth grade.
That was one of the first games I had to buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Fantastic game.
Except I'm sad that it's 25 years old because that means I'm old.
No.
And then there is an Xbox Live Arcade game that's a Minecraft clone.
Actually it's done by Projector Games and it's called...
Well, I just had Fortress Craft.
There's a Twitter for it and they're releasing aspects of the game in different chapters.
Chapter 1 is Minecraft Creative.
Chapter 2 is Crafting.
3 is Life.
4 is Machinery.
5 is Minions.
6 is PvP.
7 is Fortress Assault Mode.
So it says that the first chapter is going to be coming out for a dollar.
March 4th.
80 bucks.
Beware the Ides of March.
That's not the fourth, is it?
Whatever.
Not yet.
So yeah.
Alright, let's go to the Twitter and read some of the Twitter topics you guys have sent us tonight.
Which isn't a lot.
The tweets are looking very thin tonight.
It must be because everybody's tweeting about the Oscars.
I don't know.
They're watching Betty White.
I guess.
Let's see.
Going to Morning Wolf on Twitter says, I thought of you guys when I played pinball yesterday.
Oh, that's sweet.
What's going on in the football world?
Um, Pentegogo's coming up, I think, next month.
Pentegogo's that big convention?
Is that the one in Dixon?
I think it's the one in Dixon.
Oh, God.
But apparently they actually use the air conditioner now.
Oh, that's good.
That'll be good.
Last year was still too hot.
Are there any new pinball tables that have come out recently?
Whatever Stern's put out.
Oh, yeah, they had a Dark Knight table.
Yeah, Stern's the only one doing anything.
The last new table of theirs that I played was Iron Man.
Oh, wow.
And that was last year at Classic Gaming Expo.
Uh, let's see, uh, FlamingToilet was blanking on our email wanting to know if it was Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
It is actually Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
There you go.
Uh, Tigerclaw is sending us a tweet that is Grand Theft Auto related.
Well, I've got to say this in honor of Loki not being here tonight.
Apparently Take-Two has registered some Grand Theft Auto style domains.
They include CashForDeadDreams.com, SixFigureTemps.com, LifeInvader.com, StopPayingYourMortgage.net, and HammersteinFaust.com.
People are thinking that this all kind of sounds like the parodies that happen in Grand Theft Auto.
It is Take-Two that actually registered these domains.
They're not just like random things out of the blue.
So yeah, these are probably some of the gags that are coming up in the next Grand Theft Auto game, which everybody is anticipating will be a huge announcement at E3 this year.
We'll see.
It looks like a few more people have sent you tweets.
I'm looking, I'm looking.
Oh yes, SSJ100Matt is sending us a tweet about the whole, ah yes, Chinatown Fair has closed its doors and that officially happened on Saturday.
You know, some of my friends on Twitter, not to hijack and talk about a different subject, but some of my friends on Twitter were at AI.
which closed their doors last night.
Saturday was like the last night of Arcade Infinity.
So there was a bunch of people there.
Isn't that weird how that happened on both coasts at the same time?
Yeah.
Kind of creepster.
But yeah, Arcade Infinity closed its doors last night and then we have now Chinatown Fair did actually close.
Sad.
Supposedly, though, there is some hope.
It does sound like they're going to move to an unspecified location in Williamsburg.
So perhaps it's not gone forever.
It will just be in a new place.
I'd hate to see all those pretty machines go to waste.
Look at that.
They have little sit-down Super Street Fighter machines.
Last call was at 12.45 a.m.
Aw.
Bye, guys.
Good luck.
I'm always sad to see more arcades close.
All right.
One last tweet for you guys here.
This is from Tigerclaw.
It's a Kinect 3D printing mechanism.
Yeah, it's some type of... It's called Fabricate Yourself, and it uses 3D models that the Kinect captures to make 3D printed figures.
Interesting.
They were showing this off at what was called the Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction Conference.
They took some attendees, had their shapes captured with Kinect, and then they got turned into big, giant puzzle pieces.
So all these people that were at the expo kind of all went into these puzzle pieces, and I can't really explain this on the radio.
But I don't know.
They looked like little bars of soap.
Right.
with raised imprints of people.
But that's kind of cool that they use Kinect to, I guess, you know, do that really cheap, I don't want to say motion cap, but kind of that same technology where they can outline a body real quick with that.
So that's pretty cool.
Rob, breaking news.
What's that?
JCPenney has a new logo and it's shitty.
Who cares?
I care.
All right.
That's it for the tweets tonight.
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some more tweets for next time.
Meanwhile...
What were they thinking?
Remember it's a video game show.
I care.
I'm a designer.
I care.
All right.
Moving on.
And apparently Trent Reznor won an Oscar.
More Guitar Hero and DJ Hero download content is actually coming.
This is a little bit surprising because people were thinking that when Activision closed down the franchises, they were done for good.
In fact, the official Twitter feeds at one time said there's not going to be any more content, but they have changed course this week.
Both series said on their Twitter feeds that continued support...
from the communities have announced a change they will be doing more DLC for both franchises now we don't usually see weekly content in these games it's usually more of a monthly thing but it's still kind of exciting that there'll be something else especially because that whole pendulum pack went to DJ Hero last time that was a pretty awesome pack so more information coming
Soon.
And of course, that's all we know.
Soon.
Soon.
Tempting us.
I know.
Well, you know, Telltale, they're a company that we're pretty big fans of.
Well, they wanted to do a Scott Pilgrim game and were told no.
The creator, Brian Lee O'Malley, said, he put it on his Twitter, that they approached him, but he did not want it to be an adventure game.
He wanted it to be a platformer, which it was.
Pretty sad, though.
I think they could have done both.
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised, especially, well, maybe not surprised, but the movie didn't do so hot.
So, I mean, maybe, well, I don't want to say a better game, because the game that came out was pretty awesome, especially in that whole 8-bit throwback kind of way, and it's pretty great.
But, I mean, another game wouldn't have, I think, hurt things.
But maybe, and it's hard to tell from this story, but maybe Telltale wanted to do this instead of what ended up ultimately happening.
I mean, we don't have a timetable as to when this was asked.
I mean, this could have been years ago.
We know that Telltale likes to adapt things from comic books.
So, you know, we had a bunch of stories last week about The Walking Dead having its comic book being adapted, even though it happens to be a TV show now.
And then there was The Fable, the...
The fairy tales and all that.
Yeah, fables.
The adult ones.
Yeah.
That's being translated as well.
So it's not like they didn't have their eyes on various comic books.
So Scott Pilgrim, of course, was a comic book before it was a movie.
Yeah.
That would have been great.
Yeah, it would have been great.
But, I mean, what came out was fine.
Yeah.
It was better than fine.
It was great.
Yeah.
But it would have been nice to see what they would have come up with because that probably could have been pretty awesome too.
Oh, yeah.
Who knows?
Blockbuster is going to be selling off its assets which are valued at $290 million.
so they're going to be fielding offers I guess $290 million is the starting point there and they did do the bankruptcy filing some time ago so this isn't really surprising we've kind of seen the end coming for Blockbuster for some time that was in September of 2010 so what happens from here I'm not sure I don't know if this means that somebody could step in and buy the whole damn chain and take over from there or if this means they're just going to liquidate everything
Which could be, especially if there isn't a buyer They'll probably end up having to do that It's really not surprising They're probably going to go away
I think that's what a lot of people are expecting to happen, especially in this day and age of Netflix and Amazon.
Well, that's the same thing that happened with Hollywood, is they liquidated to try to keep from going into bankruptcy.
But it looks like Blockbuster's already in.
Yeah, they're going to go bye-bye.
Yep.
They went to the mail too late in the game.
They're gone.
It's kind of weird because I remember as a kid going to rent games at Blockbuster.
So it's just kind of weird to see these things I remember from my childhood.
Now folding and going away forever.
But I mean, when was the last time I went to a Blockbuster?
I couldn't even tell you.
A long time ago.
A very long time ago.
Are we ready to get to the email bag?
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Let us do such a thing.
We have one email.
One.
While Rock Band has done this to a point, they've managed to limit it to band-centric games like and such as The Beatles and Green Day Rock Band.
Although they did have real bands such as Spinal Tap and Queen and Let Go Rock Band, these bands were limited to performing their own songs, making their appearances more special and less awkward.
Seeing Ozzy Osbourne singing La Bamba is akin to having Madonna playing Karen Walker's trashy roommate.
While it's entertaining for a moment, in the end it makes you wonder if it really added anything besides being quick publicity.
It might be fun once or twice, but after a while you stop caring and start to get annoyed by it.
Stay black, and get well soon, Loki.
Flaming Toilet.
I think the emailer is actually really on to something there with the whole... It did become a bit of a carnival of sorts.
Carnival of crap.
Rock band never kind of went there, you know?
I was always able to take rock band more seriously.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, I agree.
And the whole, like, Kurt Cobain and Slash stuff, I could care less about that in a game.
Yeah.
And I don't know a lot of people that do care about that stuff.
I mean, maybe they're out there.
I just don't know them.
But I don't think it's that big a deal.
So maybe that cost them too much and ended up putting them out of business.
I don't know.
I don't know.
All right.
Let's get into the FUs of the week.
It's the part of the show where we rant because we're mad.
Pfft.
my FU first goes to my tooth which I think I got something caught under it but okay just to go a little bit into stupid dental history of me my canines are still my baby teeth so they don't have long roots so things get caught under them really easily and it hurts so yes another FU goes to the Oscars for not being all 100% about Betty White and Trent Reznor FU to Trent Reznor for not doing a duet with Betty White
And, um, F you to, uh, being too busy.
Done.
Um, my F yous of the week, F you to Loki for not being here tonight, but feel better.
F you to his hernia.
That's right, F you to his hernia.
Uh, and F you to the drugs that are preventing him from driving.
Although, I would want every pill in the world if I had just had surgery too, so I feel you.
Uh, seriously though, I would say an F you to, um, F you to expenses and how quickly they add up.
F you to money.
I mean, money's great and all, but money, you know, can also kind of be a, well, money can also be kind of a pain in the ass sometimes.
Hey, Rob.
What's that?
I'm gonna offer an anti-F you to Irene because she's hilarious.
Why is that?
Uh, she, she called you a shirt.
Because she's trolling me on Facebook?
Yeah.
Whatever.
It made me laugh.
One more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and your calls coming very soon.
Oh yeah, thank you chat room for reminding me of a good point.
F you to the fact that the Oscars didn't nominate Tron for best original score.
I know, right?
Because seriously, I mean, I get that Trent Reznor won and he's cool and all, but Daft Punk is better.
Sorry, said it.
Buttholes.
Anyhow.
They're smelly, stinky, crusty buttholes You might have heard that they really made it harder to get into E3 this year If you are an independent journalist and so forth You need X number of hits on your website in order to be able to get in And so a lot of people are not able to go this year Well, guess who's coming to the rescue?
Guess who's running a contest to send you to E3?
Your mom No, but close Kmart
Yes, that's right.
The home of things from the 1990s is going to be sending folks to E3.
The place with the old lady clothes?
Yep.
So there you go.
Kmart is running a thing on their gaming blog that will send three lucky riders to the event, including airfare and hotel.
The riders get to cover the event for their own outfits, but this will be reposted on Kmart Gamer.
Um...
I've got to be honest, considering everything that's come into play with what's going on in the media and so forth, with E3 and the crackdown and all that, this kind of pisses me off, actually.
Yeah.
Is that it's kind of like poo-pooing what was really insulting to a lot of people, I think, that were working very hard.
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I can get in through a Kmart contest.
But it's only three people.
Well, but it's only one person or it's only, you know what I mean?
But there's a lot of websites that would want to make that argument right now.
It's only one person or it's only two people.
So why does Kmart get to send three random people to what is supposed to be more of a clamped down show?
If I were the people running E3, I would shut this shit down.
Like, it's just, I'm sorry, but that's kind of how I feel.
They probably got permission from the E3 people.
And then I kind of see that as, I don't know, it's a little bit of insulting.
And then paid them a bunch of money.
That's just me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, oh, sorry.
Did I say that out loud?
My bad.
Today's game is Pokemon Snap.
Yay!
It is a first-person rail shooter slash simulation game.
It was done by HAL Laboratory with Pax Softnica, and it was published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64.
Basically, in this game, you go around as this dude with a camera.
In Japan, his name is Toru.
Over here, he's Todd Snap, who is a Pokemon photographer.
Professor Oak, or Okido, I should say, wants him to take pictures around the island so that they can show Pokemon in their natural habitats.
So you go around in a motorized little buggy called the Zero-One and you take pictures of the Pokemans!
My Pokemans, let me show you them with my camera.
So, uh...
You get different points based for the size and the pose and keeping it in frame.
You get double points if it's centered.
You have extra points for capturing them in a special pose.
For example, a surfing Pikachu.
Or if you get multiples of the same Pokemon in the same image.
And you basically...
Hold on to your photos, you can get better photos as you go, but you've got different levels.
You have the beach, the tunnel, volcano, river, cave, valley, and the rainbow cloud.
But some of the items have you play through the levels again.
You'll get new things that let you do new stuff in each level.
So you can get hidden Pokemon, or alternate routes, get different photographs.
and then you get pester balls because it's super effective.
You use those to knock out Pokemon or to get them out of hiding.
You get a Pokeflute which is used to wake up Pokemon, irritate or hatch them.
And then it can make them dance and they can do certain dances.
And then you get a Dash Engine which lets you go faster than usual.
And then you also get this thing called an Album Mark where you can mark which ones are your favorite photos.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and it came out March 21st, 1999 in Japan and June 30th and September 15th in North America and PAL regions, both in 1999.
The Virtual Console, we got it that, well, you couldn't save your...
Well, because it's different hardware, you actually would be able to share the photos with your friends on different Wiis.
And it came out on December 4th, 10th, and 11th, 2007 in Japan, then North America, then the PAL regions, respectively.
And it did not start as a Pokemon game, but they thought Pokemon would make itself.
And guess what?
That's true.
I will also tell you that there is another game that is like this that completely sucks and I spent too much money on it and that is the Cardcaptor Sakura game.
However, it came with a clock, a spoon, a fork, a knife, and a pillowcase.
So that was pretty cool.
Back to Pokemon Snap.
It was marketed heavily by Nintendo and Blockbuster.
And the Japanese convenience store Lawson also had a deal where you could bring in copies of Pokemon Snap and save your pictures to be printed.
And we had the same thing at Blockbuster for Pokemon Snap.
I wish we did a few of those.
They actually had a contest where you could take your best shot and you win a trip to Australia.
I remember that because we tried to do that.
I wanted to go to Australia.
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
Yeah.
And then Nintendo had a Pokemon Snap event called Pokemon League Summer Training Tour.
So it sold like a bunch in Japan for its first week.
It ranked fifth in the United States.
It sold over 151,000 copies in the first three weeks of its release.
And it was the misrented game up until October 22, 1999.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
it's really honestly I think of all of the Pokemon games that came out it was just so fun really it was so different and so unique that it really I don't see how it couldn't have you know have won it was it was a fantastic game and there are certain people that says that this is a game that should have never worked but it just did
So, but honestly, like I said, they've done other types of games like this that just did not do very well.
And, like, remember the Africa taking pictures of animals thing?
And Dead Rising even had the snap thing, remember?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, that was one of the best parts of Dead or Rising, the original one.
So it's not as if the concept isn't well liked.
It's just a matter of execution.
And I really think this was executed well.
And the other thing too is because of how brilliantly marketed it was.
You remember, Rob, don't you?
Not really, because we didn't really go to Blockbuster ever.
I mean, I did go there a little bit when I was more in college, but when I was younger, we didn't really go to Blockbuster.
We had more of an independent chain locally, so we didn't get any of that printer stuff.
I didn't own a Nintendo 64 anyway.
They were also doing, because at the same time, they also had the Pikachu Genkidichu, which in Japan, that's what it was.
In the U.S., it was Hey, you Pikachu.
You could talk to Pikachu and remember Seaman basically had that.
And Pokemon Stadium, which I thought was a fantastic concept.
But this one of the 3D entrances of Pokemon, I think this one to this day is the best.
This is by far a game that I could just sit for hours and vegetate on and just keep playing, even though it's a Nintendo 64 title.
I mean, when we got referred to Nintendo 64 the first time around, I was pissed off because how was I going to play Pokemon Snap?
Well, thankfully, there's the Wii Virtual Console one.
Well, no, we also got it again.
But I remember that was a big deal because you could send the pictures through the Wii Connect.
Yeah.
One of the few changes they made, I guess.
Wonderful.
You know, because you're not storing them on the cartridge, you're storing them on your Wii, so you totally could be wrong.
And the voice acting.
Because it had such limited voice capacity.
Nintendo's always done this, though.
They've had a couple of lines of dialogue to give you the impression of what the character's going to sound like without recording full-on dialogue.
I liked Pokemon Puzzle League myself.
But I guess we'll have to wait another week for that.
Perhaps.
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pokemon Snap for the Nintendo 64, a game that I really like, just so you know.
All right, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We're going to take some calls here to close out the show.
Remember, guys, in case you missed the beginning of the show tonight, it is a short show tonight.
Loki was recovering from surgery.
We didn't have time to get a guest host, and it's kind of a slow news week anyway, and the Oscars and everything are going on.
We're doing a minimum day, we call it here at Orange Launch Radio, like the days we used to have in school.
So we do have the Skype line open.
I would ask if there's last minute stories, but DarkSakura usually doesn't go hunting for those.
Pinkberry is our last minute story.
The Oscars were won by Pinkberry and Betty White.
So we're going to wait for some calls here.
I'll try to see if there's anything real quick here that I can pull up.
I should have been doing this before, but I've had to multitask even more than usual because Loki's not here, so I don't have as much time between stories.
But what we do have... What's that?
We have Shermie, who is laying at your feet loyally, looking offended at you.
Why would Shermie be offended by me?
She's offended by everybody.
She's mad at me because I stepped on her head while I was recording another podcast this morning by accident.
Let me get into a couple last-minute stories for you guys.
I thought we had covered this last week, but it was in our thread for this week.
I think this is just like some extra stuff even happening.
There is the Expert Remix and fan-created Kramps chapters of Super Meat Boy are coming for free, which I think is awesome.
You are not going to have to pay extra money for this or what have you.
You can just get this for free.
by the way the internets which was the other bonus levels where these two other new levels are going into they're all going to be in the internets section you used to have to get either 15 bandages or 40 completed levels now will also open the internets stage which I think is pretty awesome so check that out alright that's pretty cool let's look at some other stories here
Oh, apparently breast milk ice cream is sold out at a London store.
Disgusting.
Sounds so disgusting.
It's called Baby Gaga Breast Milk Ice Cream.
I just caught that.
It's hilarious.
It was on NPR.
Gross.
Hey, that's what babies drink.
But you don't make ice cream out of it for not babies.
You drink breast milk from cows.
It's just different.
DDR Hottest Party 4 is going to be coming out for the Wii.
If you are still following this series, of course, this is the Wii series of DDR games.
Ah, gonna be coming out on the 29th of April.
New features and innovations, they're saying.
All right, well, we'll see.
I guess you're supposed to be using now the Wii Remote, the Nunchuck, and the Dance Mat all together to do hot new dance moves.
There will be 20 licensed tunes, everything from Lady Gaga to Paramore.
Oh, Lord.
I just want DDR.
uh let's see the fate of Freestyle Games the DJ Hero developer still undecided uh and a lot of that ties in as well to the announcement that there's still download content coming so Freestyle Games has not had the plug pulled on it yet uh they may be able to make other games maybe even a new DJ Hero game I would be more curious to see if anything is happening with that uh 3D DJ Hero thing that they showed at uh E3 would you be interested in playing DJ Hero on the 3DS?
You know, I could see it happening.
I think it would actually be really cool.
There's another iOS game coming out, an adventure game, called Critter Crunch.
I'm sorry, it's by Critter Crunch.
It's called Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP, which is a 21st century update to the works of Miyamoto, Mercer, and Chahi.
It's on the official website.
Sounds like it's going to be pretty cool.
It definitely is pretty.
It'll be out on March 22nd.
Alright, let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's PT.
Hey, Dark Tattoo, what's on your mind, buddy?
Turn down your speakers.
Yes, first rule of radio, you've got to mute what you're listening to or you'll hear yourself and it messes with you.
What's up, buddy?
Yeah, sorry.
I wanted to talk about this...
Dragon Warrior, Warcraft
How exactly does this play?
Is it like an old school Nintendo game or what?
Yeah, it looks just like the old Dragon Warrior game, only you're playing with lots of other people.
And what makes this game fun?
Well, it's... It's... It's old school.
That's why it's awesome.
Yeah.
It's like playing...
It's like playing an old RPG, but with everybody.
Can you make your own content in this, or is it kind of a linear thing?
Oh no, you can create your own character.
Choose different colors and all that.
Gotcha.
Different classes.
I'm watching a video of it.
It looks interesting, but honestly, I like World of Warcraft.
Do you think this NESstalgia will tear people away from World of Warcraft?
Is it free?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's cool.
Free is good.
All right.
What's the website where we can check it out?
Oh, shoot.
I'd have to find it.
I'll have to Google it to find out.
Yeah.
All right.
DT, I will check that game out.
I promise.
Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?
No, that's it.
All right.
We'll check it out.
Take care, buddy.
It totally looks like it stole Final Fantasy sprites.
Oh, there it is.
GamerGirl just said in a chat room there it's SilkGames.com is where you can get that.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Why?
Does it look that good?
I'm already paying for something so I'll play the thing I'm paying for.
This is free.
Yeah, but I won't have time.
Sometimes a diversion is nice.
That's why I have a DS.
I'm actually playing Final Fantasy 3 and usually that's when I don't want to talk to people.
and honestly, if I wanted something that was sprite based, I'd go back to Ragnarok.
So, I can play that for free too.
And it looks better.
Alright, let's try to take some more calls here.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Dark Chester, how you doing?
Hey, good.
How are you, buddy?
I'm doing okay.
What's on your mind?
Well, I wanted to let y'all know that I'm the first time live listener.
Uh-huh.
And, um,
I've listened to a few of your past ones and I hear y'all saying to tell your friends and everything.
Yeah.
And I wanted to let y'all know that I heard about you guys through another podcast.
Oh, really?
Just to let y'all know, other people are letting other people know about you.
That's cool.
I hope it was good stuff and not like the type of stuff you'd see written on the bathroom wall for a good time.
No, no, no, no.
It was good stuff.
Oh, good.
That's cool.
So where are you calling from if you don't mind me asking?
I'm sorry?
Where are you calling from?
Louisiana.
Cool.
Well, I'm an Alabama native.
Really?
Yeah, I'm from Mobile.
Well, I'm calling from Louisiana, but I'm from Texas.
Cool.
I've never really been to Mobile either.
Well, that's okay.
You're not missing much.
Just Mardi Gras.
So what was the other podcast that we should be sending Valentine's cards to a little late?
It was AllGenGamers.
It's fairly new.
They mentioned y'all when they were all hyping about their being on their 30th show, and one of the other hosts on the show said that it's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's just kind of having that drive to come back week after week and just being in it for the right reasons.
We know we're not going to be super famous.
That's not the reason to be in this.
But just the crowd that we have here in the chat room really makes it worth it.
And just the positive feedback that we do get.
And believe me, we got to put up a lot of BS sometimes to kind of get through to that.
But you do it for the cool people that enjoy the show.
Yeah.
I already approve of them because I had an episode called The Cult of Snuggie with the dog Snuggie.
That was a great episode.
Pretty awesome.
Well, shout out to those guys and a big thank you.
And 370 to go.
You can do it.
All right.
Wow.
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dark Jester?
not that I can think of I had a couple of things but they just kind of flew out of my brain I don't really remember them now that tends to happen on live radio happens to me all the time but if you think about it send us an email later on alright I sure can alright welcome to the show and have a good one thanks for calling you're welcome bye bye you know that's funny because I thought I had seen that name before I thought that was one of those like long time listener first time caller types of things but I guess not I'm actually I'm on their Twitter right now giving them a thank you very cool
1877-GAME-OLR is the number you can call or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio now see what happened is that we were sitting there like completely empty for like five minutes and then all of a sudden the whole thing lights up so hopefully I can get to a couple more of those calls at least we'll do that all right let's see oh there it goes phone's ringing let's go take some more calls hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this hello
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
Deadline.
That person's not really there.
You can always call Echo 1-2-3 to check your connection before you call.
It's always a good thing to do.
Even if you're a long-time caller, Echo 1-2-3 is a good place to start.
Let's go to the phone so we got another call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, hey, it's Ranma from AnimeJamSession.com.
How you guys doing?
Hey, it's like podcast plugging night.
Anybody else want to plug their show?
It's like independent podcasters of the world unite.
What's up, buddy?
Not too much.
I figured that I'd rest and relax so I can give you my KatsuCon17 con report.
Yes, KatsuCon17.
I went to KatsuCon13, I think.
I think it might have been 15, and yes, there is a picture of you floating around on our Facebook fan page of you as the Black Mage.
Oh, great.
Joy and Rapture.
All right, yeah, I remember KatsuCon way out there in snowy D.C.
How was it?
It was good, but this time we're no longer in D.C.
Oh.
Yeah, from my understanding, the Omnishorm, the Hoity Toity Hotel, got tired of the con.
Acta Contracta told them, get the step in.
So we're at a brand new place called the Gaylord National Hotel, Spa and Resort in National Harbor, Maryland.
Gaylord.
Only you.
I know.
What was trending in cosplay?
Again, it's Hetalia
And it seems that the popularity of the Final Fantasy cosplay is still going down since the release of XIII.
Of course.
Actually, I wanted to cosplay Japan for Hitalia.
I've yet to see Hitalia, but from what I understand, it's very cracked out.
I've seen some crazy ones.
A friend of mine is going to Comiket this year.
I'm going to have her take a bunch of pictures because I've seen some fantastic Hetalia cosplay from Japan.
Has there been any cosplay of pantyhose and stocking?
Because that's my favorite new one.
Yes.
Awesome.
You know this means I could do Supernatural cosplay because it's an anime now?
Oh, God.
You and that show.
I fucking love that show.
It's like your new... You always get obsessed with one show at a time, and now it's that.
There's been other ones in the past.
But I've watched Supernatural for a while now.
I know.
Thanks to Becky.
It's super strong now.
Anyway, what about video game related stuff?
Before we get into video games, you mentioned Panty and Stocking.
I'm surprised you didn't ask me if I cosplayed from that since you've seen some of the episodes.
Did you cosplay from Penny and Stocky?
Yes, I was Garterbelt That's awesome Very nice What video game content was there at KatsuCon?
A massive gaming room and I know I've probably said this once before and I'll most likely say it again Dance Dance Revolution is pretty much officially dead at conventions Sad face, why is that?
They don't get the machines.
Unless you're at a con where it's majority of, if it's a gaming convention or specifically an anime gaming convention, you'll see it.
So far at cons, most popular games you'll see is Pump It Up, Connect Games, and Rock Band.
I was going to say, do you see people playing Dance Central in full cosplay now?
I have.
I've seen a couple of people doing it in full cosplay gear.
Oh, nice.
Nice.
I didn't have any pictures because at the time my camera was charging up in the room.
Excuses, excuses.
You have to come to Fanime this year.
I can't do Fanime this year.
I'm broke.
Are we even doing Fanime this year?
I'm planning on doing Fanime.
You need to talk to people and see if we can do a thing there.
I have to think of a new costume for this year because none of my costumes fit.
Talk to Rice Princess because she was rattling off in guild chat the other night about wanting to do some type of cosplay.
But anyway.
Well, let me ask one more question then.
What was some good loot you saw in the dealer room?
T-shirts mostly.
Any good T-shirts?
What kind?
What were some funny slogans you saw?
All right.
They have a female shirt with two boos on it.
Wait, so it's a shirt with boobs on it?
Yes, and it says along the lines of, don't touch my booze or leave my booze on.
Thank you.
Please stop looking at my booze.
Oh, it's booze.
I thought it was like one of those shirts where they draw the tuxedo on it or something, but it's just a shirt with boobs drawn on it.
And I was like, why is that?
That's not funny.
That's weird.
That's redundant.
I get it.
Booze.
Stop looking at my booze.
I get it.
I like the one that Becky has, though, of the D20s.
It says, yes, they're natural.
Oh, yeah.
I've seen that before at conventions.
And don't forget the Cleric shirt.
Plus one shirt.
Cloth shirt.
No, no, no.
It's a parody of the Cleric's logo, but it says Cleric.
It says they may heal you, but they still hate you.
Just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.
Yeah, that's it.
Alright, one more question.
Thing they most need at Katsukan 18.
Chicken Katsu What's that?
Febreze Alright buddy, I'm going to let you go Have a good one I'm posting this in the chat The masquerade was great There was a link to a video
My friends doing a Super Mario Bros.
musical too.
What will Brian Boitano do?
It was really fun.
Okay, wait, I'm looking at this here.
I can't see an O. Anniversary.
Anniversary.
Every time I think I rescued the princess, she's always in another castle.
And all I think of is this thing.
I'm ready to deal with it.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Mario, you know this has.
You can do it.
What you need to do is think about your mental.
And what he would do is really think that would work for him.
You know, the best part about watching these videos, Ranma, you know what the best part is?
That being?
It reminds me that doing an internet podcast about video games for nine years really isn't the nerdiest thing I could be doing.
Yeah.
I've seen a wedding at AX.
Just saying.
I've seen wedding proposals at Masquerades.
All right.
I'm really letting you in now, buddy.
Have a good one.
All right.
Thanks for the call.
Alright, what the hell, one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Sons Radio, who's this?
Hi, can you hear me now?
Yes, we can, what's up?
Hey, it's DDR Dollar Bill here.
DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?
I saw you posting saying you didn't have anybody calling in so I figured well then it all flooded it always works that way I don't know if it's the delay or what because we have this weird two minute delay between when we do things here in studio and when you guys hear it it used to be like 15 seconds and then all games change some things around I think we bounce I think our feed goes out into space and then comes back to earth before it gets to you now but whatever hey you know what at least we have a place to do our show what's on your mind buddy
and nothing much.
Just calling on pass if I say hi.
Still waiting on a friend of mine trying to create a gaming laptop for me.
Gaming laptop?
What are you looking for in your gaming laptop?
Let's put it this way.
This has got to be something that can play at least, the very, very least, something like Mass Effect 2 or Call of Duty at least 60 frames per second.
So you can't do a little netbook.
You're going to have to do something a little more uber than that.
Right.
But here's something funny today, though.
I tried a couple over at the Best Buy just for kicks and giggles.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I don't know what the hell most of these guys are doing, but I crashed every one of them.
You crashed every laptop at Best Buy?
Some people do that on purpose.
Some people will go into Fry's and try to crash all the computers before they get caught by the burly-looking dudes that are trying to sell the computers.
What are you doing?
Not that I would know, but I've heard.
I did this on accident!
All of them!
Were you hitting Ctrl-Alt-Delete on all of them as you walked by?
Actually, that's not a bad thing to do on a computer as it used to be.
I did something else.
Half of them, I was just checking out some of the specs.
Some of them, I was just trying to run this one website where you can check to see if the computer can run your game.
I forget what it's called right now, but it was a really good one, and
I'll get it later on, but I tried a couple of those and they started crashing and then I had to reboot a couple of them and I'm like, what the hell is going on here?
Why can't anybody make a good computer anymore?
A couple of questions in our chat room here.
DarkToagak says 60 frames a second is overkill.
30's not cutting it for you?
Hell.
Fucking.
No.
I saw that coming.
Why not?
No offense, but if I want 30 frames per second, I'll play it on the Xbox and be quite honest, 30 frames per second actually... It's not accurate.
It doesn't feel real.
And...
No, no, I play a lot better when it's full frames, when it's a smooth motion, because then it feels more real to me.
30 frames, it's all choppy, and I'm missing shots left and right.
No, I need to be that precise.
And Brad from PodCulture is saying, isn't it rather hard to build a custom laptop?
That is a good question.
I mean, laptops are not quite as easy to build as the desktops.
Oh, I know.
You're just trying to find the one that matches your specifications?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I know, but I've done it before.
All right.
Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?
I got to rewire my damn pad so I can play DDR again.
There's a new one coming out on the Wii.
That's the reason.
I need a wire so I can play on the Wii.
New Lady Gaga and Paramore.
And PS3.
All right.
All right, buddy.
Good luck on your quest for new DDR.
Have a good one.
Thanks, guys.
Check you later.
Bye.
I guess DDR dollar bill is not just a clever name.
All right.
We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line up.
Sorry to those folks who didn't get through tonight.
You can always send us an email.
Mail that orange lingerie dot com.
I love some of this evil stuff you guys are talking about in chat.
Brad from Pod Culture says, I've also done stuff like take a screenshot, set us wallpaper, then hide all the icons.
Oh yeah.
That's evil.
Well, at my work, we were always told we had to lock our desktops.
So the manager of our group would actually go in and do, you know those little rotating word screensavers?
Oh yeah.
He'd put those up or like put pictures of like blingy teeth up, you know, and put it on tile and
and uh or put up like some sort of really bizarre like this one dude who was like doodly doodly and he put up a picture of like a pink pony hot yeah very hot all right well that's gonna bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lawn Tradio I know it was a short show tonight but hey you know what
Sometimes real life gets in the way.
So we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
DarkSakura, have you sobered up?
Excuse me.
Oh, it tasted like ice cream.
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
Pinkberry!
My final thought is...
I don't know.
Stuff.
IDKS.
IDK, LOL, WTF, BBQ.
You mad?
You mad?
All right.
That's going to do it for another episode here of Orange Launch Radio.
Thank you so much for tuning in.
If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about the show.
Help us spread the word.
Leave nice reviews on iTunes and so forth or wherever it is that you download podcasts.
Thank you for sticking it out with us tonight.
Have a wonderful night, everybody.
We'll see you next week.
Hopefully Loki's back.
Do you have our special tribute ready for him?
I will.
I'll have that ready after the show.
